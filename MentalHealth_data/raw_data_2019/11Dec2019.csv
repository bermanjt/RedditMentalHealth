0,"Ok so this might be a long one sorry for the rambles.

My best friend and I have been friends for just under a year now and it's safe to say she is not a mentally healthy individual. I'vee known about them for a while but since starting uni they've worsened.

From what I know, since about the start of high school she has always been ostracized for something. Her so-called friends ridiculed and bullied her, she always felt inferior to the popular girls, and in Sixth form she was sexually harassed by anonymous messages.

This kinda prolonged trauma would damage anyone and it certainly damaged her. She decided that the only way to dull the pain caused by others was to become her own greatest source of misery. If she hated herself enough then nothing anyone else could do to her would matter.

This has translated to her constantly feeling ugly and sad and angry at herself. And then, when she feels this way she punishes herself (i.e. By refusing to let herself sleep) which only increases the cycle.

Granted these patches of severe depression are usually only a week or so long but they're not all that's wrong. She's anxious and feels cooped up in her room all day, not having anything to do outside in the harsh winter and finding no joy in watching Netflix or doing art. Right now she flinches at every touch, hating her own skin.

She's refusing all ideas for therapy, saying a therapist can't be personal enough, that she doesn't want to change, that nothing can be done to stop life's rapid decline.

And it makes me so sad to see this kind, sweet, wholesome person beat herself down and feel unable to get up. I do my best to talk things over and reach out but from a far-off uni things are hard.

Any advice for me or her would be greatly appreciated 

And if anyone reading this needs a pick me up, you got this pardner, my DMs are open.",11Dec2019,1
1,I have depression and anxiety and it’s really hard to get anything done. I get so tense and stressed and worried about getting things done that I can barley do anything at all. I have trouble even leaving my house and I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve tried “pushing through” it but I physically can’t. I’m stuck.,11Dec2019,1
2,"I’m a 17 year old high school senior and I’ve  just had it with life. I’m sick of my parents, especially my dad. Ive had enough of my anorexic younger sister going out of her way to be a petty bitch to me. I’m tired of my school and want to get out  of my town. I have no regard  for anything anymore, including the law, my health, Hell, my family, my small group of friends who barely talk to me and my pets. There are no mental health institutions  for me to stay, because my dad compares them to asylums. The suicide hotline can’t help me anymore, and they never did. I always fantasize about dying in a mass shooting or some shit and I love it, because it’s the only thing that gives me hope that I might be able to finally escape this horrible three-dimensional world. Waking up in the morning has turned from a blessing into a curse. I look in the mirror and hate how I look like a cute little blonde girl, the kind of girl that everyone thinks is sweet, perfect, and innocent. I wish I looked on the outside how I feel on the inside, but I guess it doesn’t matter because I’m dying soon. Sadly, even though I’m American I don’t have access to a good gun that can kill me. I can’t starve myself because that’s a horrible slow way to die. Im not bleaching my stomach. want to either shoot or hang myself, going out with a bang, preferably shooting myself. I even beg my friends to kill me, but because of the stupid law you can’t consent to your own death: funny ain’t it",11Dec2019,1
3,"I don't know how many more days I have left at this point. I hate lying to make myself look better in front of my family. I hate faking everything. I hate being lied to by people I care about. Everything means no. Yes means no. no means no. looking means no. lying means no. The only way to get it to go away is pain at this point. I just had to chuck my anxiety meds because I was going to OD on them earlier. I think I just bought myself a couple days. I can't get any meds because they want to get my ekg checked out but that was a month ago and I don't have any time until after school ends and even then, how long am I going to have to wait before I'm locked away wanting to find a way to kill myself in every waking moment that I still breathe.",11Dec2019,1
4,"I feel like so many of my perspectives and opinions about so many topics (controversial and not) are unpopular enough that I'm worried neither sides of the party concerning said opinion will think I'm a reasonable human being, or at least not worthy of discussing those topics with.

5,This is my first post so I'm sorry. I dont really know what's been going on but for the past maybe 3 days I've been feeling impending doom. Normally I'm fairly happy and normal but lately I've been feeling awful. Any ideas what could be the cause of it? :),11Dec2019,1
6,So long story short I can't go to psycare anymore because of attendance so they gave me a list of referrals but I lost it. I'm halfway through my meds which are buspirone for anxiety and generic Prozac for depression. Idk where to look. I know it might take a couple sessions with a new councilor for them to prescribe me. I don't have insurance either. Where should I look?,11Dec2019,1

8,"So I struggle with depressive episodes for about 10 years, for the last 5 i was in a stable relationship with someone. My partner could never really deal with my frequent ups and downs an ultimately broke up with me half a year ago (wich i think is understandable in some way).
Poblem is, though I was quite a social person most times during our relationship, since we broke up I had no social contact/interaction in any way, besides buying food and cigarettes, nor do I have any desire to.
I know secluding myself from everything makes my down-phases more intense and frequently, but I really cant bring myself to talk to anyone. I have lost nearly all my own friends during the last years due to me ignoring texts, behaving shitty during drunk-sad-rage or them moving away. I know I should so something before my depression may get the best of me but i really dont know. 
I visited a psychiatrist and a psychologist in the past, but besides prescribing adderall and telling me to ""be more social, exercise and maybe look for a shared interest group"" nothing came from it. 
So what now?",11Dec2019,1
9,"This is very complex to write about... but it needs to get out of the head and minds (we are 3 active switcher typing/ one with a depressive episode atm) Nene, j0 and Romy. This might also helps Romy to get a better understanding of j0's constant questions lately...

 

So this is a little of our current life with dissociative identity disorder after 3 decades:

&gt;We are a late diagnosed DiD-female in the mid 30s physical age.   
&gt;  
&gt;While '**Hannah'** is our birth identity - Hannah2 turned out to be our core and she is majorly co-conscious with at least one another's identity since the age of two. We were a social neglected and pasty child.  
&gt;  
&gt;On top of dissociative identity disorder, there are four Alters 'diagnosed' with each their own trauma and cause for chronic depression. Coming and going. The relapse of three over the past couple of month - including Romy (-Romy) - is taking a toll on our body's condition. Psychosomatic pain overstimulates Hanana2 esthesia as host and shifting all our body perception in different directions.  
&gt;  
&gt;*j0:* All blood results came back as normal.  Just some little changes on the edge of (low) to average (normal). So while our physical health is jus at a low-point, but not 'sick', all we can do is to hope, it will wear off soon...

&amp;#x200B;

**We have not talked open as ourselves to anyone on the 'real outside' until the beginning of 2019** (by accident). 

&gt;'Hannah's life and upbringing was very conflicting through the years. Our family. Surroundings. Other pulse-people. We grew up in a society which strongly did not believe in most mental illnesses. There was just weak-normal-insane.   
&gt;  
&gt;After our 'blank year' we hide to not draw attention on Hannah. We tried hard to be normal, to keep up, to be one - we failed. again. over and over. Going through therapies and other medical sessions hiding our DiD into adulthood.

&amp;#x200B;

**We always knew about our individual identities (Alters), but everyone else just saw 'Hannah'** 

&gt;Romy has the biggest problems to step into the Identity of Hannah outside. She can't adjust to the growing age gap. The feedback after making contact with people, whenever she tries, makes her feel personally rejected and disliked by people of Hannah's physical age. Every first meeting with someone keeps her concerned for days. Her mind stopped aging or can't catch up around 16, the time she disappeared for the next 7 years. Now she tries to act double her age since the most encounters after her return ended in some ways bad.  In her perspective and she gets afraid to cause yet another harm to how people look at 'Hannah'. We always try to get her to understand, that she adds the least to Hannah's outer conflicts.

&amp;#x200B;

**'Hannah' -** We have a healthy body... *on pape*r 

&gt;...born premature and almost died just few hours after birth on spontaneous suffocation, leading to cyanosis.   
&gt;  
&gt;*j0:* So we have been told: Our small body spent its first weeks in an incubation box in another hospital, which had a special ICU child nursery, where we were tested and watched over; leaving, with no knowledge if damage was caused or ever recorded. We just know further: the infant body recovered within few weeks and developed normal reflexes. ""a little slow but not out of the ordinary"" growth till toddler's age.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Nene:* Josefine (j0) believes the impact of this 'near-death' as infant and the lack of oxygen could have caused some sort of new link between self-recovering braincells of the baby's brain, allowing the DiD to evolve in order to survive. She spends most her wake time researching and puzzling with our individual memories collection on the time board.

Falling sick very often as child also resulted in being left behind and alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Hannah2 sees and us as equal valuable parts to Hannah' Person.**

&gt;Even though she's the body's core identity, caretaker and the one with the strongest esthesia link, best to control the body's motion and balanced senses. Hannah2 always watches out for safe switches. She may suppressed an outburst till xy but never forced any of us to stay in, 'integrate' or disappear. She accepts us the way we are and never forgets to buy all things we like individually, rather than for herself.   
&gt;  
&gt;... But our body's respond to the last years gets too much for her. We've been constantly switching between the others, because Hannah2 hasn't felt or described a positive body feedback for a very long time.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Organizing Hannah's life with controlled switching is a daily struggle we can not/wont/fear to show people but it is necessary for Hannah2's rest.  Our body is signaling his physical exhaustion to the point, we don't dare to run around, do sports or getting outdoors for too long. That doesn't apply for all of us though. There are five more 'unbound' Alters, who switch when they have the urge to come out of the dark. Two have amnesia gaps, one is seemingly half aware of Hannah2 from his end and one seems fully detached from Hannah's birth identity.   
&gt;  
&gt;We communicate leaving notes behind. 

&amp;#x200B;

**another jump to the past**

&gt;We were five identities co-aware of each other with the body's age of four. We share the same memories in different perspective. The terms host, core or original had no meaning to us as child identities and was not yet clear to us anyway. With the innocence of a child's mind in a dozen, we shared the body freely. We also expressed our switches openly and acted out our individual natures - regardless of sudden personality changes. We always rather 'played' with one another as imaginary friends. Even in Kindergarden next to other children and in school later. We had a lot of trouble to fit in and still do.

&amp;#x200B;

**We have many good memories but also many blackouts. Hours, days... weeks, a whole year...** 

&gt;With seven years we ended up in child therapy session somehow. None of us recalls fully. Well, our odd kind of behavior in front of adults brought us there - but that's another story. We have no memory of almost the whole year that followed. Eventually three of us 'woke from the dark', after we had a fever for days. We were utterly confused, scared and again: left alone. Till today we have no own memories and what we'be been told, we never got a hold of that one Alter to communicate.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Hannah2 suffered from the same blank memory as Jeanne and Josephine. We also lost two of our child-alter friends Neko and Ben, which never returned to this day as far as we know.  With almost nine years, we started to hide inside and became a docile child and teenager (for the most...) We don't know for certain about all Alters. We know of some, we have lost along aging like Ben and Neko (\*The Dark is what we call the space inside the body. Our inner peace zone, where all our identities consciousness seem to lie dormant but not all are reached by Hannah2. It may sounds negative to you, but 'darkness' has a positive association in our shared memories)

&amp;#x200B;

We have no idea how to move on with 'Hannah's Life in today's society because of the past years experiences, which we all failed. Work, family, relationship.... We are becoming more and more physical passive and avoiding other people, even though we are at peace within - we worry about our future.",11Dec2019,1
10,"So to start with I'm sorry for any grammar mistakes in this as I am not the best with grammar so ill try my best to make everything readable as possible. I am currently 17 and living on the south coast of England and I'm happy for anyone advises this is sorta what is for maybe its because atm I'm on a low high or maybe IDK but it's taken a lot to write this. 

The past two years have been especially difficult for me and I have struggled a lot and avoid speaking to anyone about it due to the fact well I dunno I struggle to address that I have a problem and every time I build up the confidence to say that ill speak to someone I panic and act as if I never have the thought. 

I know I have not addressed how I feel yet I was just giving back story to the situation mainly because it's hard to explain how some weeks I can get massive high points where I'm so happy and over nothing but they can go like nothing and I go back to feeling alone and sad the problem is these sad points are so low I honestly just want to die and it's what stays on my mind a lot of the time quite often I'm just sat laying in bed questioning if I would be missed or who would notice I was gone I hate it I do I wish I could control these emotions but they come from nowhere and it's as if I can go a  day just feeling normal it got to the point where I wasn't leaving the house for weeks at a time and, to be honest, all I did was eat sleep and drink I didn't have motivation for anything else I cut of most of my close relationships during this time minimizing the number of people I was speaking to I just didn't have the motivation or confidence to leave the house. I dunno if that's normal or other people normally feel like that too and just hide it as I do but nobody I've ever spoken to seems to be as messed up as I am they all seem normal. They'res a lot more but I don't fully feel comfortable saying it all yet. 

After here is just a detailed list of my life since the august 2018 

Now I'd like to explain my situation with relationships and getting close with people as this is something that makes these dark moments even worse in around august 2018 I found my first proper love and by love I really mean I felt for this girl I mean she was my everything like even the dark days felt better with her and I think that's mainly why I feel for her so much because she made them dark days much more bearable she was like a light just as my life was so dark she came into it and everything felt better with her in it in the short time I knew her she made me so happy words can not understand how much I care for this girl. But things weren't all perfect as happy as she did make me some days the dark days got even worse than ever before I won't go into it too much but we got in lots of arguments because of other people in her life and it caused problems between us it was honestly more painful than anything I've ever experienced, however, I kept forgiving her for everything because without her in my life everything was even worse than before so having her in my life even if them occasional bits of extra darkness was there it was better than it being dark every day. What I'm trying to explain is this girl, to be honest, saved me as much pain as she's caused in my life she saved me and I've never really been able to fully admit it but she did.

During my time with the girl previously mentioned we often cut each other out for months at a time and these months were so horrible most days I couldn't help but think about her but I tried to find someone to make me happy as she did this often failed because I doubted everyone always over thought or I got lied to. The first girl, I tried to find happiness with was a girl called Chelsea she was nice but still, with her, the bad days didn't stop they were still bad and I then also got bad thoughts about her thinking she's lying or just using me because she's bored but time goes on and I was worried about a guy she was mates with she promised me she wouldn't do anything with him however she slept with him and that completed broke me she lied to me and broke a promise I instantly resorted to what I know best cutting her out and erasing her from my life. 

After this, I didn't know what to do with myself most people in my year were worried about the mocks and the soon coming GCSEs I really didn't care the thing is I never cared in school never cared about GCSEs never cared about mocks none of it I just I didn't know how most people will just say it's a kid who couldn't be arsed but in reality, I had no motivation to get out of bed so most days I was late for school when I was there I never really felt like I fit in with everyone else the whole time I was there I just faked a personality to act like everyone else and I hated every day I'd go home and feel so alone I was living a life of lies so I didn't really have anyone at school who knew the true real me which left me feeling so low the whole time I was there I tried to act like everyone else misbehaving and acting like I'm having fun so I didn't seem different.

At this point time, it was around November December so currently about a year since these events I and the original girl started talking again I'm pretty sure this is because on her birthday the 18th of December I decided to text her saying happy birthday only because I was desperate to talk to her again but it felt good to see her I remember it is cold outside and us two were sat in this basketball court type thing and her laying her head on my legs and me just playing with her hair and face and at this point, all the pain went away I wasn't bothered that it was practically freezing I just felt happy with her nothing else matter she just cured my pain like she always has, but of course it didn't last long soon she was gone out of my life again and that pain started again.

Late December I began to get extremely close with who's now my best mate like we began to become close mates before but that bound just got so tight around this time we began to call all the time and she generally cheered me up a lot however she was they're seeing what the original girl did to me seeing how messed up I was because of her and now she hates her I hate it my best friend hates the girl I love the most.

A few months go past and nothing majorly bad happens I'm still always sad me and the original girl got in contact again but yet again it was short-lived, during this time I got involved with the wrong type of people and tried weed for the first time and to be honest, I didn't enjoy it that much just acted as I did due to wanting to fit in with everyone else I tried it a few more times but never got any real enjoyment out of it and often ended up turning it down using excuses like I've gotta be home soon or I can't have my family smelling it, drying the time I was out with these people I didn't really have fun like everyone else I sort of just sat there and zoned out why everyone was having fun but I guess it felt nice to be around people for a change even if they only wanted me around because they were high it was good enough to get me out the house sometimes other times people would call me to tell me to come out but I just couldn't my body physically wouldn't let me leave the house it was horrible I was a prisoner in my own body.

Around this time I found a friend group of girls that I seemed to really get along with and it felt nice most of these girls we're attractive and I got into a friend group with them I soon began talking and getting closer with one member of the group however that ended when it turned out she had a boyfriend and picked him over me this caused an argument between the group however this ended up with me getting closer with another member of the group and me and this girl became really close since the original girl I hadn't felt this close to any girl we used to speak every night and day and meet each other after school and I'd walk her home taking on purpose the long way through the woods this was awkward for us both because the group then turned on her and I felt responsible for it however nothing major happened until things stopped with me and her because she replaced me with another boy yet again all I felt was pain it was as if I was so replaceable to everyone but I didn't let this get me to down I tried to be stronger this time as I had begun to just realise that im not meant tobe properly happy everyone in my life is just tempory and I was okay with that  well, to be honest, I was but alot of the time my view was that im going to end up killing myself so why does it all matter, So i stopped bothering with people as much i stopped going into school alot now i just had no reason to want to leave bed so i faked reasons not to go.

I guess more has happened but it isn't important it just feels good to let some of the bad out and just even if no one reads this fully it feels good to lift it off my chest recently I felt like I was getting better after the summer (were isolated, everyone) I began college two days a week I haven't been late yet, I got a part-time job mainly because I thought having a reason to get out of bed would help however, I still feel sad every day maybe it's not as bad now but there are days with no real reason at all it just gets horrible to deal with and all I want is just to see someone and them tell me I'm going to be okay but course I don't have anyone to see. I don't know if I'm depressed and even if I was I would be too scared to speak to anyone in real life about it but I'm just glad I managed to type this all without breaking down. 

Well if you read this far thanks for reading this took a lot for me to get out I'm sorry about the grammar and spelling as I said i sorta gave up in school and now paying the price for that anyone's comments or advice would be nice if you've been in similar situations or even felt as I did it would be nice to have people to chat to about this all",11Dec2019,1

Staff do not take pain complaints seriously, nurses chart things they have never done like ""encourage patient every 30 minutes"" when in fact you only saw them once the whole day. 

At the location I stayed at there was a deck of Uno and 1 deck of playing cards. Those cards were so old you could not even shuffle them. 

The ""daily"" schedule posted up was from over 10 years ago and more than a little outdated. 

Now I do not know how common these conditions are, but this was my personal experience.

Unlike other departments, mental health staff seem to given a lot of freedom in the notes they write. In my medical record I have found very misleading or outright false statements claiming I said those things. For example I talked about how I unfortunately had a negative experience with my last antidepressant, the psychiatrist instead wrote ""patient is not receptive to taking anti-depressants at this time.""

15,"When I was 12 I studied a year abroad in the UK, living in the school there and it was a great experience, I made great friends there. After that year I went back to my country to keep living with my parents, and although for a while I kept in touch with some friends through the internet, we ended up losing that connection and stopped talking to each other. Nothing bad happened, just time went by and we lost touch. Now I am 23, and while my life is not bad, it isn't very exciting either. In school I was top of my class but in uni everything kinda went south after some personal issues and depression distracted me from my career and I started failing subjects. I am currently finishing my engineering degree while still living with my parents, but the general grades I have gotten are average at best and my future isn't looking super bright. I don't usually use facebook anymore, but recently I logged on and saw some of my old Brittish friends pages. Turns out the same group that I used to be friends with stayed together in that school and is still super close, they go on vacations and see each other all the time. They are all very successful, one became a doctor and two others are physicists, doing their PhDs. They all have girlfriends and their lifes very together, while my life is a mess and I've never had a girlfriend. I had the same potential they had when we were kids, but the different atmospheres we grew up in took us in different ways. The thing is, my parents told me they would have let me stay in the UK if I had asked them, and while at the moment as a kid I preferred to go back home with my parents, now I'm starting to think that I might had made the wrong choice. For the last few weeks I've been obsessively looking at my old friend's profiles, thinking of how my life could have been, living with friends instead of my parents (who have a pretty toxic relationship, which in part caused my anxiety in uni) and studying abroad, being more independent. I can't stop imagining what my life with them would have been like, its so weird and kind of depressing that I'll never know. I look at their interactions and they still seem like super fun people, the kind that I would still get along with very well. It's a weird thought but I would be a totally different person with different interests and a different way of thinking if I had satayed there. Most of the stuff that defines me happened after I came back. I know what I'm doing is super unhealthy, but I just can't get these thoughts of my alternate self in and alternate reality of my mind!

Immediately after this, I was unable to rest for 4 days straight. My mother moved out and my roommate and I had to do a metric fuckton of cleaning and were still doing it. Work has me scheduled long shifts despite me telling them numerous times that i cant work long shifts due to my Fibromyalgia.

22,"hear 'voices' in my head (usually sound like me *i am a female* but also often male) that tell me that it's God and that i'm going to die, or to hurt people or myself ('stab that person' 'drink that bleach') 

anxious 24/7 and often can't relax because thoughts overwhelm me

when i see things they're just shadows or gone quickly and are NEVER in color but are translucent/see through

fixated on death and dying to the point it keeps me awake afraid i'm going to die in my sleep and other scenarios

thoughts don't feel like my own but often are disturbing and make me feel ashamed

don't let scabs heal (picking), hands in hair most of day, organizing and cleaning attacks when i feel any distress or discomfort 

does it sounds more like psychosis or OCD?",11Dec2019,1

24,"I've been so stressed and sad lately. A lot is going on in my friend group, finals are next week, and I'm having family issues. This all has caused my appetite to completely go away. I have barely eaten anything this whole week, yet I haven't felt hungry at all. Hunger pains have become just a pain that's there to me.

I haven't really been in a great mental state for a while. I've asked to see a therapist and my mother is yet to make the appointment. 

My friends have started to notice. They'll ask me if I've eaten pretty much every hour of the day. I'm physically repulsed by food. I shudder and cringe every time I have to take a bite of food. I dread dinner every time. I had a breakdown after dinner tonight because I heard my step-mom saying I was disrespectful for not eating a lot. I feel really bad. I forced myself to eat as much as I could, even if it was only a few bites.

This isn't the first time this has happened to me. It's actually a common occurrence to me every time I find myself in a dark spot, which is a lot. I'm scared because my friends are planning to have dinner together tomorrow and I have no idea if I'm going to be able to eat at all.",11Dec2019,1
25,"I'm not talking about giving up--just reframing things in a realistic perspective given life thus far. Moving on from my childhood naivety and innocent optimism, so to speak. I'm talking about things like accepting that nothing (and I truly mean nothing) will ever be easy in life and that I'll always have to put in double or triple the effort just to barely scrape by. That, despite seemingly being more qualified/more prepared/'better', I'm (99.999% of the time) not going to be prevail, get the job offer, succeed socially, appeal to someone over those around me, etc.  

It may sound slightly self-defeating but, the way I view it, it's the only thing that puts my life into perspective and make me go 'oh, okay this makes sense now--the pieces fall into place'. Over the past few years especially, it feels like I've essentially been collectively gaslit by society, friends, family, doctors, therapists--and it makes me question my sanity often.  

For example, I used to not be happy about my appearance so I put in effort into exercising, improving myself, striving to keep my personal hygiene as immaculate as possible, improve my posture, voice, etc. Now, while there is still stuff I could improve upon, I feel the most confident I've ever felt in my looks and appearance. As a result, some of my friends, therapists, parents, and doctors have said that I look good and that appearance-wise I have no problems. In fact, upon meeting new therapists/doctors or making new friends, they almost don't believe me when they hear about my longstanding social struggles and not existent dating/love life. From an outside perspective, Photofeeler (as potentially questionable as it may be) puts me at an 8.5 attractiveness-wise with \~50 votes. 

On top of this, every doctor/therapist I've been to has told me they barely believe I have social skills issues or social anxiety (and honestly, I agree with them). They say I have no issues articulating myself, making eye contact, showing emotion, listening+speaking, etc. Hell, I've been DENIED entrance to a social skills group because my therapist thought it wasn't necessary and would have been a waste. 

So, point blank, I think I look great and in turn I feel great. But nothing changes. In fact, I'd say that trying to interact with people (guys or girls) is MORE difficult and less fruitful and it was in the past. I get absolute disinterest, uncomfortable looks, no effort in the socializing dynamic--and seeing the stark difference with how my other friends are treated makes me HONEST TO GOD feel like everything is staged. I just can't wrap my head around it.  

Then the nail in the coffin is the dismissive of literally everybody. ""I don't think there's anything wrong with you"" or ""It's okay you'll be successful (socially or romantically) one day!"" are the bane of my existence, because clearly something isn't lining up here. 

So my point is, at this juncture, it's nearly too much effort to keep up the mindset in the my head that ""I'm worthy"" or ""I'm normal"". It's a waste of my energy to greet people with a smile and be enthusiastic only for the to grace me with the same sullen responsiveness like they just came out of a funeral--only for them to drop the act as soon as I leave or anyone else shows up. On top of this, I'm tired to being the one who gets automatically relegated to some subordinate status despite behaving like my peers. I'm tired of being left out of communications, decision making, social gatherings, etc.",11Dec2019,1

27,"So i honestly don't know what ill end up writing here or why im doing so, but fuck it lets give it a try.

I should probably start this with a bit of an insight on who i am before i speak of my mind and other shit.

Im 19 in February, i flunked high school college and work. Im a bit of a ""Ghost"" so to speak i have no online presence except this i guess. Im incredibly lonely, hell i think i might even be addicted to my own isolation i have a couple mates but rarely see them and the only time i do is when weed or alcohol is involved and even then i can chill with them for up to 12 hours and only end up saying a handful of words. Im quiet i never used to be back in high school i was the class clown i wouldn't shut up i remember my drama teacher telling my mother that i was one of the best and funniest students he had ever had, i dont know what changed but now i talk to myself more in a day then i do in a month when with others. Im different i mean who's normal and all but im very different, my beliefs, philosophy's and just my overall mindset is unique i guess. I live with my dad and despise it (ill get back to house and family matters later) I find almost no enjoyment in anything as a kid it was gaming but now that can barely occupy my mind for more then a minute, im always bored and empty. Half the time i dont give a fuck about anyone or anything the next im so self conscious and anxious it physically hurts. Im actually fairly talented as a kid ever since about 3-4 years old ive been a bit of a math wiz, for a long time my parents put alot of pressure on me telling me im some kind of mathematical genius with my dad even going as far as to say ill one day discover the secrets to the universe using some bullshit equation, i fucking hate numbers. I was always the smart kid but as i said a weird kid too, i dont know lets get to the point aye.

I never really know what im feeling, i dont get empathy either, im hollow, empty and its horrible because i know theres something there im pretty sure i can feel i just dont. Ive been deppresed for 6 long years and it seems no one cares, my mum seems to just ignore it like she dosent want to imagine her son hurting inside which sucks she is super supportive of my sisters problems but seems to ignore mine and my dad well this might be long aha. When i first realized i felt this way i didnt go in school that day, i left a note for my dad explaining why. He came home late drunk as always he read the note and what he did is one of the funniest fucking things i have ever witnessed, he put a knife to my neck and told me if i wanted to end my own life then i should then he was screeming at me telling me i make him want to kill someone , he went outside for about ten minutes knife still in hand then came back and punched a few walls then passed out downstairs and keep in mind when i say knife i mean a fucking bowie knife he ended up giving me for my 16th the blade's bigger thaen my damn head, i was 14 ahaa what a cunt. I went to the docs multiple times they say its normal, sure. I made it to Last year without doing something ""severe"" i had 2 or 3 mental breakdowns i only really remember 2 though the first wasnt much i just ended up punching my tv and laptop to bits than smashed my bong, i couldnt stop shaking. The next i ended up spray painting things like ""Save me, Kill me"" and ""Im so sorry"" all over my bedroom walls then left a note, i cant remember what it said. I was going to walk i dont know where but i just wanted to walk away from everything then i came back because i remembered my mum was going on holiday in a few days i cried so much when i remembered that, i felt so selfish to make her worry so close to her holiday. And the doctors once again said this is normal and did nothing i mean what the fuck man.

Now to present day and the past year, i cant stop imagining a world where im a serial killer i even have my own unique twist every kill i would leave a usb stick with a video of me projecting my thoughts the more i kill the more of an insight it would give on why, i was even thinking of writing a book or try to get a show produced on that core concept. Karma its a name i cant seem to escape not a unseen force a name, my name or another me? i dont know. I dont believe i would be able to kill but i think i would be good at it, treat it like its a form of art.

Im tired i break things when im bored not angry, i cut when im empty not sad its strange as i said i dont really feel emotion but i kinda know when i should so in a way i trick my mind into thinking that i feel. The worse thing for me to feel is empty and or bored.

Ok i honestly dont know what i have or haven't put here my heads all over the place so im sure this is too but long story short i have nothing to live for ive been hurting for 6 fucking years im all alone with no chance of getting a job my mind is fucked even my physical health is fucked im so sick of staying strong and just being pushed around anyway and theres prolly much more but im already bored dont know why the fuck i spent time doing this but aye ive wrote it why not post it so any wisdom and or support pls thx",11Dec2019,1
28,"Hello everyone. I apologize in advance if this is not the correct sub to post but I am confused and upset. Please let me know if there is a better sub to post this on. 

I (21F) had recently gotten out of a 3 year relationship (24M). I had been the cause of the falling out because I had physically attacked my now ex. For the backstory, I was a little tipsy at the time as I had just hung out downtown with some friends and had gone home. I was playing a video game (DOTA) with him and had asked if we could cuddle when we went to bed. He had snapped at me for asking questions and distracting him during the game because I kept asking since he didn’t give me a response. This had made me angry and once the game finished, I stormed to bed and rolled away from him. He tried to touch my back and hold me and I got upset saying that he didn’t want cuddles earlier cause he snapped at me so I got up and left calling him mean and selfish. I then started arguing with him just outside the door and had gotten so upset, that I ran inside and physically attacked him. I hit him twice and he then tried to restrain me by holding me down and was slightly choking me with his arms, and that just made me more angry and I hit him some more. 

 I know what I had done was wrong and I feel EXTREMELY horrible for doing those things to him (it still eats me up inside that I had even managed to do that stuff) and I’m very concerned about what I had done. I am in a stressful situation with college and being far away from family, but this is my junior year and I’m unsure if I am mentally healthy anymore. 

I am thinking about talking to a therapist, but I also don’t know if maybe it was just bad timing of everything falling apart for a minute and if that was my breaking point. I feel horrible for the actions I had done but I’m also stuck at the fact that I don’t think I asked for too much of him. I don’t know what to do and just wanted some advice and maybe some insight. Thank you for taking the time to read this.",11Dec2019,1

 When I look at you, I still see the freshly 20-year-old, outgoing, charismatic, young man who carefully gained possession of what was left of my almost non-existent trust and fragile, teenage heart 13-years-ago. I still see the confident smile that belonged to a rambunctious boy who knew the world was full of possibility and opportunity, and he could conquer any obstacles that lay in his path. That smile... oh... that smile 😌 it melted so many hearts, and I’m so lucky to be the ONE woman who is still able to coax it out of hiding from time-to-time. 

You are the man who saved my life more times than I can confess and the person who’s pure and beautiful soul I have been blessed to be able to create and build my life with. You are the devoted, adoring and incredibly nurturing father to our three magnificent children. You are my kindred soul... the universes answer to my life’s purpose... and... my darling... believe me when I tell you that I would be LOST without you... 

I love you. Not in the truism sense of the word. Not because that’s what we, as humans, have been conditioned to tell someone with whom we show adoration toward... No...I am chemically and cosmically connected to the fabric of your immortal energy. My spirit requires you... I NEED you the same way I need air, water, and food. You ARE my soul’s sustenance. 

So that’s why... on the day when you tried to kill your self, three-months-ago... I felt like a part of me died. For weeks, I’ve felt like I have been living with a stranger and I haven’t known how to look at you. Not because I love you any less, but because I haven’t been able to understand how you could have gotten to that place where you felt so bombarded by your own mind that you pushed every primal, human instinct to survive away and KNEW you needed to permanently escape. It breaks my heart to think about the agony you must have gone trough to get to that place where you felt like it was time to leave this earth, without option or hesitation. I feel so guilty that I, your closest and most intimate friend in this world, never saw the signs and couldn’t be there to save you from yourself.

I’m so, incredibly, lucky to still have you with me, and I’m trying my best to understand how that beautifully complicated mind of yours functions. I know you’re not ready to talk about it, but I would hope that you would forgive me for seeking advice from other’s who might also suffer from Paranoid Schizophrenia, so I can gain a better understanding of how you are wired and how I can be there for you now and everyday in our future...

I really didn't want to go on another med after dealing with weird side effects from the other so I said I would try therapy. It's been almost six months and I've finally been able to email the therapy place and they tell me to call and set an appt after I read the profiles and chose a therapist.

34,"I don't get to interact too much with others who go through similar things to what I do, and I just really need to vent/get a second opinion about the situation. I just found this sub and figured I'd try out talking about it.

My younger brother has always been a big source of stress and worsens my depression all the time. We're 6 years apart (I'm 24 and he's 18), and I've been told, ever since he learned to talk, to ""let it go"" and ""you need to grow a thicker skin"", ""let it roll off your back"". My appearance has been insulted, my intelligence, I've been told I'm useless and a failure, while growing up. We know now that he has anger issues, but it's become my mom's excuse for him. Whenever I've asked for something to be done, I'm brushed off. And then when I'm ever upset ""You're better than that"" and ""You're older, act like it"". 

When we were younger he was physically violent towards me, and he'd go off on a hair trigger (still does, it's just not physical anymore). My mom's favorite line when I was running away and yelling for help, ""Get along or get apart""

I'm trying to save money to move out with a friend in the future, I'm just so emotionally exhausted from living with them. They don't listen to me and I'm out of therapy right now, so it seems like the best solution is to get out of this situation asap.

So if you read all that; first of all thank you, and second, I really need to know that I'm not crazy or overreacting about any of this.

37,"Hello, 

I’m just going to be as raw as possible but not give a big sob story. Three days ago, I started feeling a butterfly in my stomach type feeling. It is almost like my stomach has a void while simultaneously in knots. I’m not upset about anything specific. But this feeling is waking me up at night, is almost constant throughout the day (aside from when I’m at the gym or doing something very distracting). But I’m feeling so uneasy about it; almost as if it’s going to last forever. I’ve never experienced this type of anxiety. I’ve only had some social anxiety issues (red flushing face and chest, sweaty hands, flight or flight) that I’ve worked through quite a bit. 

I did have some dramatic life changes happen: 

1. In September I discovered my husband had been cheating on me while out of town for work (he’s out of town now). We’ve made great strides in our own therapy since then. I do feel like I’ve forgiven him but at the same time I’m definitely not as emotional as I was before — sort of as if I’m either a) going number or b) emotionally maturing. I have no clue. But I do feel like I’ve really moved forward in healing. We still have a lot of work to do but there’s been a lot of progress so far. 

2. I just finished a semester of college + interning 300 hours on top of class and homework. I’m now on my “down time” and have been taking it very easy with doing things I wholeheartedly enjoy like being with my son, working out, cooking. In six months, I’ll graduate and begin my career. I’m very motivated to be successful and am doing well in this area. 

3. Two weeks ago I transitioned fully to a plant based whole food diet. (Idk if this is significant)?

4. Since not interning or in school the past few weeks, I’ve been using social media more. I want to stop but kinda feel hooked right now. I do sort of feel like I’m living in my phone but this isn’t something new to me — I just have more time to do it right now since I’m not as busy working during December break.

most of the time i daydream while listening to music but i also daydream just like all the time throughout the whole day. 

this part may sound weird but i’ve actually had panic attacks because i’ve felt like i’ve daydreamed more than i’ve actually lived or like experienced life. and the times i got those panic attacks i would desperately try to stop daydreaming but i never could and i just ended up trying to deal with it. 

i really wish i could see a therapist about this but i don’t even know how to start to bring this up to anyone. for example one time i was going through something (that still sometimes happens and i’m still not sure what it is to this day) where i felt like i basically wasn’t real and tried to tell my parents and that just called me crazy and that was the end of it.

My current therapist is very kind and patient but we’re making almost no progress.

She’s admit it herself that she isn’t sure how to help me and she feels sorry for me so we’re both unsure how to proceed.

Also for context- I stopped taking my Zoloft. It hasn’t worked for a long while but instead of going to my psychiatrist to be weaned off I just quit cold turkey on my own. Of course this means I’m more unhinged than usual but we’ve been having these issues before I stopped.

hi

I got married in feb 2018, my husband was fine with what ever i was doing like shopping or meeting my friends, but after getting married he started restricting me with speak to my closed ones like family (mother ,father and brother) and relatives. He was too possessive when i was talking to my parents.

After four months of my marriage i asked him if possible can we plan for a trip as we are getting long weekend, he suddenly started shouting for no reason and told ""I shouldnt have married you , i married you because of my mother. I should scold her"".I was confused did I ask him anything wrong. This repeated for a while with the same dialogue. I couldnt take it and when i visited my parents i couldnt control and started crying out loudly. My parents went and talked to my husband parents, they started blaming like your daughter is so weak she cant do household work she gets tired,, blah blah... however I went back to live with him. I started working then .. when i got my first salary , he mentally abused me to give my bank account password .. and from then he started transfering my whole salary to his account , which made me even more sad. 3 months ago i changed my password and he made a mess of it saying your money minded how dare you change the password without my permission and made his mother , father and brother speak to me about my salary. At that time my mother and brother were with me I told my mother again if they start one more drama i cant take anymore , I feel like dying.. Immediately they booked a ticket and got me with them. Even while leaving he didnt stop me from going , he stopped me and asked how do i use your salary if I require .

Can you please help me or tell me if i can coutinue with my relationship with this person. Am I safe with this person?",11Dec2019,1

I'm annoyed that I'm not doing enough for my family. Yet, annoyed that it feels as if I'm doing everything for them. I'm annoyed that I can't see my future. I'm annoyed that I want to give up on my future. 
Am I just being a brat? Just hiding myself away and not being productive? Wallowing in self pity? I still go to work. I do my job. I go to my appointments. I clean the house, cook, organize, care for my pets. It's just my attitude that's all out of whack. I love my family, but I can't stand being around them, hearing their voices, seeing their faces, being in their presence.
I'm just isolating myself. I can feel my emotions just shifting every second. Am I really sad? Am I just being pitiful? Are these feeling real? Or am I just being an attention seeker? I can't tell what I'm supposed to feel. Can't I just snap out of it? Am I making this harder than it needs to be? Just stop crying. Just smile. Just be happy. Just do something about it, but what? What do I do? What am I supposed to tell myself?",11Dec2019,1
47,"*MAJOR DISCLAIMER* 
first this is on my phone so i apologize for errors, also this can obviously be triggering so be careful when reading and ive been told before my way of describing my mental illnesses is ""attention seeking"" and i usually reword it but i dont feel like it so enjoy my post in all its ""attention seeking"" glory

i suffer/have suffered from multiple mental illnesses. these include: depression, self harm/suicide ideation, anorexia, and what i think is anxiety and adhd. 

my parents are aware of the depression to some extent after bringing me to the er. long story short: i wrote in a journal i wanted to commit suicde, my friend broke into my locker and read it, and reported it to their teacher who told the principal. my parents were called, i went to the er, in fear of disappointing them i dialed it down. (real story: i had attempted suicide multiple times, self harmed regularly, and had been in a depressive episode for about 5 months. what i told them: i had never attenpted suicide, thought about it once, never self harmed/thought about it, and i had been in a depressive episode for 2 months.) i was given a psychiatrist who told me i had communication issues and that was it. saw 2 therapists while waiting for the hospital mandated one, didnt tell them much because hey reported directly to my parents. saw the hospital mandated one but still didnt say much. 

this was about 3 years ago and between then and now i went through 3 severe episodes of anorexic tendencies, and i have been experiencing progressively worsening anxiety since the summer (i will automatically go to worse case scenario and convince myself its actually happening to the point of me shaking and my heart racing. i also get s u p e r nervous when crossing the road in fear of doing it wrong, coughing in class, asking a teacher to go the washroom (ill avoid asking for my 75 minute class because i get too nervous) and getting up to through something out during class).

i would like to get a therapist outside of my parents because i want to be able to freely discuss the things i listed above but because im still legally a minor i dont think thats possible. ik legally they cant tell them anything unless my life is in danger but my parents usually end up sitting in on sessions or would say ""your therapist can tell us what you guys talk about right?"" in a super condescending tone that doesnt leave room for argument.

ik reaching out on a place like reddit isnt going to give me much but all of my friends are able minded or live too far to help so this was my last attempt at something",11Dec2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

Don't even know where to begin with this. I'll start by saying I have always had an issue of ""overthinking"" things. Whether it be with work, relationships, or with friends, anything I do or say, I often just find myself overthinking my actions or what I said, to the point where I start to doubt myself, my abilities, and ultimately it just crushes my confidence. I can't help but constantly think about everything I said or did no matter the time or place, and it is starting to inhibit my day to day life. I can't go a day without constantly overthinking the texts I sent, or even the work I submit at my day job; ""was it right? did I get my message across? Were the figures in my report correct?"" I understand maybe having self-doubt when submitting work to a boss or to another co-worker and wanting to double check it prior to submission, but sometimes I find myself checking it, over and over and over again until I finally say to myself, ""Ok it's fine, just submit it."" That lack of, I'm not sure if it's confidence, in my own work, is crippling. I feel like I can't do anything in my day to day without this constant process of doing, overthinking, doubting, and then losing confidence in myself, over and over again. Even the other night when going on a date that seemed perfect, I'll just lose confidence in the end because I'll start to overthink about what I said over a drink and then start to doubt myself, ruining my night. I spoke with some family and they say I'm just a really conscious person, but I feel like it's more than that. I can't focus. I can't take my mind off something I should just stop thinking about. I can't have confidence in myself because I'm constantly doubting myself because I'm constantly thinking about my actions. Feels like a downward spiral.. 

Apologies if this text wall was repetitive, wasn't sure how to get my message across and wanted to just vent a bit. I want to see someone on it, to start to figure this out and not have this issue ruin my life any further, but I'm honestly not sure to begin. A Psychiatrist? Counselor? Therapist? Any suggestions appreciated!",11Dec2019,1

52,"At first it was things that aren't uncommon. If I heard laughing behind me, it was probably about me, if someone said it smelled bad near me, then it was probably me. I was constantly worried about disgusting those around me.

Now things are getting worse, and idk if it's normal or not but it's ruining my ability to intereact with people.

I am obsessed with the way I smell. Although I take showers regularly and wear deodorant, perfume, all that, I am convinced I smell bad. Then something might happen at school, where I hear someone talk about it smelling bad, or I'll smell a bad scent, and I'll immediately assume it's me even if logically that wouldn't make sense. Once I've taken a little incident out of context, I'll try to intereact with people as little as possible so that they don't smell my bad scent, the whole day I'll somewhat tense, constantly straining my ears, trying to hear someone comment on the way it smells to confirm its me they're smelling.

Just today, it suddenly began smelling like bad popcorn or something in my classroom for a few minutes before it went away. Ruined the whole day for me. That smell was unfamiliar to me. There is no way I produced it. But I spent the whole day convinced it was me.

I have the same reaction to pretty much anything, the smell is just the biggest part of it. But anytime I hear some kind of criticism or shit talking from someone else, even if the gender of the person they're speaking about is different than mine, I become convinced they're all laughing at me. I constantly feel like people are making fun of me because there's something wrong with my appearance or smell and I just don't realize it.

This may be caused by my overwhelming fear of someone becoming disgusted by my presence and me just not knowing it. 

That's another big thing, I'm constantly on edge, overanalyzing people's actions and becoming convinced that they don't like me anymore.

A few weeks ago I was convinced my friend was annoyed with me so I spent the whole day in such a low state I couldn't eat.

Last week I convinced myself that my parents didn't love me anymore and was planning on killing myself that night because they didn't want me there(thankfully we were able to talk before I went to bed and I realized that was not the case)

I just don't know why my brain is doing this and what I can do to stop it but please help? It's lessening my ability to just live because I'm so on edge the whole time, and I might actually commit suicide if I convince myself of things similar to my parents.",11Dec2019,1
53,"both my boyfriend and i have struggled with depression and anxiety since way before we met each other, and both of us have been through some pretty traumatic experiences. lately, things have been real tough trying to get back on track. 

i love him, and i want to be there for him, but he doesn’t necessarily let me. he likes to handle things on his own, which i respect, but it often leaves me in the dark. he doesn’t like to talk about these things while i’m the complete opposite; i explain how i’m feeling and if there’s a reason, why i’m feeling this way just so he knows.

it just hurts because he has admitted that he can’t fully enjoy being with me because of what’s going on in his head. i understand what it’s like to feel numb, but we are at complete opposites right now; i am feeling emotions that seem to be really amplified and he seems to not feel much at all.

i will admit that i have been faulty. i have been having a lot of anxiety lately and when i’ve been worked up, i tend to blow things out of proportion which has been happening a lot lately, a “fight or flight” response as my therapist put it. it has been happening when i feel like i’m being left in the dark because i feel as though he’s pushing me away. i’m worried, but he always tries to convince me to not worry. 

he’s told me that no one, not even me, can help him. i just don’t know how to go about this without hurting him because all i want to do is just be there for him. i want him to at least have some peace. i can tell he’s been trying, but i can also tell it’s been burning him out. 

i don’t know what to do. i’m way too in touch with my emotions right now and have been really sensitive lately, and he’s been out of touch with his. we’ve talked about it a few times, and i’m trying to bring myself out of this anxious-depressive weird mess of an episode so he feels more at ease. we just don’t seem to be like ourselves right now because of our mental health.

Most of the time im just angry and worried that I'm never good enough to live up to other people's expectations even when my extremely supportive bosses say I'm doing great.

I don't really understand emotions. Today a huge amount of negitive things happened all at once and Its not like I couldn't handle them, I did fine, but I felt extremely rushed to get everything fixed faster than I was capable.

I can't afford to go to therapy but I want to know if I'm ""normal"". I can't hold small talk and trying to talk to someone 1 on 1 I get extremely fidgety and sweaty.

57,"**I'm sorry that this is long, I** ***really really*** **appreciate anyone who takes the time to read.** (This is something I’ve pretty shamelessly posted in multiple subs, I’m just in need of some perspective and advice right now. Sorry if I’m spamming)

I'm a 20 year old dude, I'm gay. Since I was maybe 8 I've had an on-off obsession with wedgies. When I was 13 we had a cousin stay with us, he was 12. I gave him a lot of them, he gave them back, thought I would have coerced him quite a bit. When I was 13 or 14 I asked another cousin who would have been 9 to give me a wedgie in exchange for something. 

At that point I hadn't ever jerked off, I didn't realise it was a 'fetish'. There was no sexual link, although I did know it was kind of wrong/inappropriate, but I just wanted so badly to try. Since realising it’s a kink, I haven't done anything similar since, and those memories aren't ones I revisit sexually, at all. I cringe if anything. Nothing outside my own head makes me think anyone cares/remembers or is troubled by what I did. 

Then, I'm 18. One night I'm lonely, sleep-deprived and horny and I want to chat to someone with the same kink. Dude wants to role-play, he won't if I don't show my face, so I just think screw it, sure. I'm horny enough not to care, and I don't have an idea of what to do with my life so I'm just living day to day, I just don’t care. He wants me to play out a jock/bully scenario, just has me being wedgied and dominated and embarrassed a bit, it’s kinda cringey. I consent and I enjoy it enough during, but afterwards I regret it, not immensely, I just know I don't want to share with someone in that way again. A few months pass and I don't think about it even a bit, but then one day I just start to worry. I shared my face, my voice, I gave that away to someone I didn't know or trust. I find him again, ask him to delete them, he says he's sorry but he can't bring himself to delete them, though they will never be shared. Eventually I just say alright, I go to sleep, I don't think about it for two years.

Now, the worry has come back. I message the person again, this time he shares his name and face with me: Facebook, Twitter, to imbue some trust or security I guess. He says he's sorry but again, as of right now he is not deleting them. I keep up talking to him, maybe I can convince him, two-three weeks later he out of nowhere says that they've been accidentally deleted. I don't know how to believe him.

It's been a month and a half and though I'm better it's still bothering me. I feel dirty for sharing myself with someone I didn't know or trust, but I couldn't find anyone around with the same kind of kink: it's kind of an obscure one and ironically, at the time I felt safer sharing from my room than meeting someone in person and running the idea by them. I've had six sessions of therapy, which has helped, I've talked to others who share the kink which has helped also. Here are some fast facts:

1. I wasn't jerking off in any of the pictures or videos, no nudity. Therapist says a lot of people won't recognise the sexual/kinky side to it. Will just see it as some kind of joke, odd role-play. I can always downplay it, just say I'm in to dom/sub and it was all the other dude's idea etc as it was just a one time thing at 18 years old

2. At the time of the pictures and videos I hadn't kissed a boy, hadn't had sex, dated, or had a boyfriend. I was experimenting, maybe too much. I guess loneliness breeds some odd behaviours.

3. It's been more 2.5 years since and they haven't been shared: he has never held them over me, tried to blackmail me or made me feel like he might share them.

4. I had a great week a couple weeks following my therapists advice to not think about it as “it’s not a problem right now, it will be if they’re shared so deal with it then” and also from some kind words from fellow redditors. I was back to my old self and when I thought about it, it was in passing like “Hm, that happened, I know not to do it again”. 

I know I'm a good person, I made some mistakes driven by a kink that I've had from a young age. I just can't bear the idea of my family or friends seeing me in that way. It was a role-play, but along with being embarrassed of the wedgie kink, I'm ashamed that I gave my face and voice away, I feel like if they're shared and traced back to me there wouldn't be as much sympathy because I shared them in the first place. Sure, everyone has kinks but not everyone has shared them in a permanent way such as pictures or videos.

I don't know how to admit this to anyone irl, or how to repent, do I even need to? My therapist says I haven't done anything ""wrong"". This has helped, but I have guilt, fear. My therapist thinks that them being shared may be good: it would demystify how ""bad"" I think this is, she thinks I would find out that no one cares that much. I don’t know.

I want to ask: is this that bad? Sometimes it feels like it’s not that bad, and then it feels like it’s really bad. Should I just not think, like therapist says? She says that after some time of doing that, I will be back to how I was the last two years: happy, studious, guilt free, focused on self-improvement. I don’t want my family to be hurt by this. I'm sorry again that this is long, I just want to hear an outside perspective on this. 

**So please, tell me how “bad” you think this is - be honest** I just feel abnormal, perverted and that because of this I don’t deserve to feel normal or happy (even though that’s how I felt for most of my life, even after sharing the pictures/videos).

* Major Depressive Disorder
* Panic Disorder
* Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
* Schizoaffective Disorder

It is the schizoaffective I am most worried about. He says that he will hear voices that are not coming from a person speaking, and they are troublesome to him. I couldn't get much more detail out of him, but his doctor prescribed Haldol for use as needed when he has more severe episodes. He's also on 6mg Klonopin/day for his anxiety. He is a complete mess, mentally; it takes him abnormally long times to do the simplest of tasks, frequently doesn't finish sentences, and sometimes says things that quite frankly make no sense whatsoever. He also has a hoarding problem with TCGs (trading card games); the floors of his house are covered with cards of various sorts. There is no organization whatsoever, and you have to walk over the cards to get through the house.

I should note that it is highly unlikely that he is a danger to himself or others. But he told me that he thinks he needs a girlfriend to talk to these things about, as opposed to a therapist. That is just not right. He is not functioning at a high enough level to even consider getting a job. He needs to be on SSI, have Medicaid, and see a therapist regularly.

I have brought this up to him multiple times but he doesn't really listen to me (his attention span is so short that it is difficult to convey more than a sentence or two at a time to him). I realize that it is his life, and not mine, but I have known him for 20 years and really do care about him.

I was raised by my grandparents for most of my life and they are both pretty type A. Very status driven, neat, all around perfectionists and they expected me and my brother to be too. We were both more type B, laid back, don't  really care about positions or titles and disorganized.  Add into this that my grandma was very passive aggressive and you can probably imagine a lot of what went on. We were just expecting to excel at everything and not doing so would mean that high pitch voice trying way too hard not to sound angry telling you ""I'm not mad sweetheart just disapointed"" which could arguably be worse than mad because of how it made you feel. 

As a result of this, I find myself constantly berating myself for not doing enough. And I am also always expecting those around me (bosses, friends, my husband)  to be just as disappointed in me as I am. This is especially hard with my marriage as I will inevitably misconstrue something my husband says as an insult and get mad at him when really I'm just mad at myself because I will never feel good enough.

68,"I want to start by saying I'm an extremely private individual, It's hard for me to come out and discuss such a topic, even if it is to strangers in a community. I just hope that what I can say can help even a few people understand mental health a little more and how understanding the topic might be used to better help those that need or seek help by sharing honestly one of the worst experiences I faced and hopefully to help myself vent the anxiety and tension by openly discussing it on this forum.

Just a few days ago, I went to seek help at a local Hospital. Over the course of many years I fell into a bad habit of self-harming from and assortment of depression, anxiety and unfortunate events. One that's gotten worse and more frequent the last few years and one that I'm aware is damaging sociably, mentally and physically. I lead an otherwise normal life and keep this part of me extremely private. It took a lot of courage and bad cuts to get me somewhere where for once I could admit I needed help.

After pleading my situation and getting stitches, the doctor at said Hospital responded respectfully and professionally to me but ultimately had no choice but to Baker act me and send me to a Behavioral Center for up to 3 days. This was the start of an absolute nightmare.

I started my Journey being escorted by Police early in the morning with no sleep, in handcuffs and stripped of my clothing, I would add. Anxiety, Depression and now stripped of my dignity and put to more shame. I know, procedure, I'm sure. As I arrived, I was immediately judged and other than one Ex-military gentleman I was treated really poorly. My questions and concerns were mostly shrugged off or I was just outright ignored. But hey, I must just be another loony, so who cares, right?

The real fun began as I was escorted to prison, as it should be called, after waiting in the lobby for several hours. Both nurse escorts had more fun teasing each other and treating me like an inconvenience when I spoke than talking to me about what I should expect or know as I had little idea where I was or where I was being taken to. As I enter the hall, already filled with massive anxiety and emotions, I'm immediately aware I'm in a literal box-room shaped psych-ward and realize right away just where my cry for help has led me so far. I'm given no direction or concern other than a short list of do's and don'ts by any of the 5-10 nurses in their box. At that point I'm no longer a human but clearly an animal. They don't tell me what to do, where to go, just that my clothes will be returned shortly. 

For the next hour, I sit in the nearest chair, shaking with literal fear and anxiety in my exposed hospital gown, no more than just 8 hours after having one of the biggest breakdowns in my life. I'm immediately swarmed by several patients with actual severe behavioral disabilities and I start having a panic attack, but this is just normal when you're crazy I suppose, so why should the nurses care? I had to finally get up and ask for my clothes as the shaking mess that I was and could see I was obviously bothering the nurse/attendant who had my clothes in a bag before he handed them off not saying a word.

I wanted nothing more than to go to a room and get away from everything and after asking literally 3 different nurses I finally got an annoyed and stern reply and was designated a room where I could quickly change and feel a little more dignified. I was immediately terrified this was my life for up to the next 3 days. I knew immediately this place would break me entirely and I needed to get out as this was not the help I was looking for or needed. I could get little to no response from the nurses who, were all too busy yelling at or ignoring the patients, as to what I should expect or what to do next. They would literally look up and go back to their computers or give me an annoyed, ""Yes?"" followed mostly by, ""I'm not sure at this time""

I spent the rest of the afternoon having panic attack after panic attack trying to stay strong with no one to help and no one that cared. My phone was obviously confiscated. I couldn't find help there, or inside. I was being bombarded and cornered by troubled patient after  troubled patient where all I wanted was to escape and be alone. I couldn't breath and felt restless and I felt all I wanted was to die and 10 times more suicidal and helpless than I had ever felt outside ever. I did find some solace in a nurse/attendant named Troy, who was one of few who I felt ever cared and the only one to notice my distress and sit and talk to me while I broke down. Actual real talk. I finally got responses and the answers I needed and was treated like an actual human being. A big thank you to people like him. 

The following morning, I met with the Psychiatrist. This man was the worst. He would cut me off constantly and only further chastise me for what got me there. He would say I wasn't normal and only ever state what was wrong with me and ask why I did the things I did. When I said I wanted help he suggested how I should go find it myself and gave no provisions or information. He rarely would look anywhere but down at his paper and cared little for what I had to say but only to get through with his day and patient list. The only good news I got was he was confident for me to be discharged by 11am, just a few hours more.

For almost 5 hours, I sat and waited while being forced from my room in the meantime. The only place where I felt somewhat together. I waited and waited and now 12:30, I finally asked a nurse who after 5 hours hadn't even started my discharge paperwork, she said so herself in a non-concerning manner and she'll have it done in a few hours. By 2 in the afternoon, I was finally ready. Unfortunately, I failed to realize or understand in the initial boarding that I couldn't be released without first having a person sign me out/pick me up in person. So after another hour, I was finally leaving with the biggest relief I had ever felt after 36 hours in anxiety hell.

All I wanted when I entered there was no longer help but just how to leave and self-preservation. Just how to lie and pretend the best I could for I wouldn’t have to feel like an inconvenience or animal and trapped any longer. To try and stay strong without the ones important to me, alone in my shell, for I wouldn’t appear broken or weak and held any longer. All I could think was what is it that will get me out fastest? What can I say or not say to get me out now? Why did I do this? Am I really like these other people? Is this my future? Am I this broken? Is this where I actually belong? 

Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar, Mood swings. These traits can fit 2/3rds of the population. You expose them to enough of the same and put them together with those with more severe behavioral disorders, how do you expect they’ll ever think they’re not crazy? That they’re not different? That they will get better or find the help they need? How can you possibly think that a place like that will ever be healthy to 80% of its attendees.  
   
That Behavioral Center and probably many many other Behavioral Centers, are a joke from what I experienced. They don’t aim to get the patients care or support. They instead stick them in a box with a fancy name to where the world no longer has to care for them. There needs to be a change to the system, or a change perhaps to different levels that each kind of behavioral concern or disorder should be treated in those centers. Better educate the staff, doctors and nurses. Maybe make different wings or care units for different disorders which hopefully already exist in a few centers by now. And, if you’re someone who works at one of these centers, always remember they are human, and they’re only crazy because we tell them they are. Even if they have severe disorders, make them feel loved and welcomed. Even the sanest of us all would break after a week isolated in such conditions alone from everyone they know.

Unfortunately, I went somewhere for help. That in turn, ended up breaking me more. I’ve lost faith in what happens when you reach out and that is what should have never happened. It wasn’t one person at fault. Not the Nurses, who are trained or adjusted to behave one way. Or, the Doctor who sent me there thinking it was right. It wasn’t the patients or their families or the system but us. All of us. It was our lack of knowledge on how we treat and expect mental illness and the stigma involved. I was treated like an animal; a criminal; different and a disgust to society. No one asked, “How can I help you?” or, “What can I do?”. Only, “What’s wrong with you?”, “Why do you do this?”, “Where does this come from?”, “This isn’t normal”.

There’s a lot to learn, I believe, when it comes to Mental Health awareness and how it can be treated. There’s still much shame involved with the subject and it is evolving to be more acceptable and I think we really are going in the right direction, but we still have a long way to go. Care for those that need help. Step up and get them that help, personally. That’s how you save and fix their lives. These fears are what leads people to not get help and what leads people to self-harming addictions and death. Show them the way and where to go. Give them that help and love. If you truly care for anyone, be there, with them, don’t send them away. They need you, the ones they go to, even if they act like they don't. They do. I do. What they need, and always need, is you. Their Mother, Father, or Brother or Sister, etc.  Their SO, their friend, their coworker or even just from strangers.

69,"Dear r/Mental Health, 

I've got this awfully intrusive habit of seeking out or waiting for external gratification from people. I've had an issue for many years and I was hoping for some advice from this awesome community. It isn't anything huge, but definitely something that impacts my life and behaviors in the long term. 

It is mainly a problem when I'm in a romantic relationship but it also impacts my personal friendships. 

For example, when I have strong feelings for someone. I am always thinking about them or thinking about when they will next message me. I'm almost waiting for them to message all the time (sometimes it feels like a challenge of who can wait the longest before texting and it can feel like torture).  This sort of thing can make me really down like when I message them and they don't reply (perhaps they are not online or they are online but don't respond). 

It started off with seeking Facebook likes. I used to not be very popular in high school so once I got to uni it was a fresh start. I got involved in a lot of communities and became really extroverted. Eventually I was adding people to get likes on Facebook (ended up accumulating around 2500 friends and 500 likes on my dp). This was exhilarating at first (felt like a big challenge) but eventually I realized I never really enjoyed getting the likes in the end (thought it would make me feel awesome but it was just meh). 

Anyway, I realised that these behaviors were really toxic and unhealthy and so I decided to get away from craving social media attention. I deleted anyone I knew I wasn't friends with and made my pictures private and such so it wouldn't be about likes. 

As a whole, I feel like I cant feel comfortable in my own space. I am constantly hoping someone will message me (instead of being comfortable with just enjoying my own company). I understand that that is a trait of an extrovert but I think it can also be very exhausting and can lead to a lot of disappointment on my end and feelings of loneliness (even though I have plenty of friends and do plenty of stuff). 

So far the only coping mechanism I can think of is 'don't think about x person or don't think about it'.

So I want to start carving out that space for myself and just start enjoying my own time without seeking external gratification. Does anyone have any experience with that? Any advice is welcome!",11Dec2019,1

71,"I'm not really here to give a woe is me story. I'm more here to discuss how society deals with mens mental health and how they shun men when they are in abusive relationships. It's disgusting. Why is it that women deserve all this care, and heck be given basically free rides and given everything, when a man goes through a similar situation, he gets laughed at, told to suck it up, and stop being a bitch. I've had this countless times, seeming anytime I try to open up to friends or family. Why is this ok? Why are we allowing society to blindside the issues of female abuse, and uplift women's issues, and even use them to bash and degrade men? This is not ok, honestly I'm terrified to even talk about my issues because of this. I've never been given proper help or support, from anyone who is supposedly there to give such when I am in need of it. To be honest I'm still married and living in the same house as this women, because there isn't anywhere for me to go. Everytime I ask for help and open up, I get shut down, told I need to stop running from my problems, told to get over myself and live with it. If I were to say these things I'm told to a woman, I'd be lynched!! And rightfully so! So why is it ok for me and other men who are in similar situations to be treated so poorly and tossed to the curb? Honestly I've been contacting suicide hotlines pretty heavily the last month.. and yet.. I still get this sense.. that they don't believe me.. or think I'm some kind of idiot or something... If society is really wanting to take care of our mental health, why do we get shut down for trying? So for the long rant.",11Dec2019,1
72," Family Therapy -Psychological Counselling in Delhi

Family therapy or family counseling is designed to address specific issues that affect the psychological health of the family, such as major life transitions or mental health conditions. It may be used as the primary mode of treatment or as a complementary approach. Often, while working with children and adolescents, it becomes crucial to understand the dynamics of the family to bring about a change in their life.

Soulprism aims to promote understanding and collaboration among family members in order to address the challenges of the individuals. For example, if a child is having challenges in social situations, therapy will also consider the social patterns of the family and then address the concern as a family for long term benefits of therapy.",11Dec2019,1

I don’t know why am feeling this way, and I even told people on a thread three hours ago that I’m fine, after really thinking about that phrase,I realize that’s definitely not the case.

     I have severe PTSD and agoraphobia, but I’m a business owner and have to go about My duties On a daily basis without regard to my mental health, which is huge part of my industry. I cannot talk to my loved ones about these issues because I don’t want them to worry. Every psychiatrist in my area has a waiting list a mile long and a I run out of my meds tomorrow, it’s only gonna make these issues worse. Since yesterday morning I’ve been thinking about the movie seven pounds and how the main guy goes out in a way that helps people, and I can’t stop thinking about wanting that for myself.

I usually have the radio playing as well, and even that sometimes doesn’t help. I’ll turn the light off and I’ll start auditory hallucinating (?) footsteps or thumps. Eventually, I’ll start imagining horrible beings or situations. My friends think I have a fear of thunderstorms, but it’s really a fear of power outages. I have an emergency plan if the power goes out. Battery powered nightlights, radios, and lanterns, along with candles and my other (more embarrassing) coping means. I’ll also relocate to my couch instead of my bed, as the couch feels more confined. It also doesn’t help that I suffer from an over-imagination and frequent nightmares.

I feel like I don't exist in the same space as humans anymore. I can't concentrate on anything. I don't have any passions and I'm not very proactive about the little interests that still remain. I have all the free time in the world but I do nothing with it. I can't afford therapy and I can't find a job because I have no skills. I don't leave my house except for routine things. I spent my entire life wishing I was dead instead of developing myself. Lately I have troubles sleeping. I've come here because the people I can talk to about these things are far and few. Most people become hostile and start gaslighting me when I try to open up about things. They don't believe there's anything wrong with me and I get similar responses from doctors. I really don't blame them.  They don't know how hard it is for me to get by because I closed myself off at a very young age after seeing how none of my troubles were addressed. I figured I would save them and myself the guilt and sorrow and just rely on the part of me that still believed in the future. That same part no longer seems to be functioning. I suspect that I'm developing or have an undiagnosed condition.

I've always tried to lead a healthy life with plenty of exercise, sleep and self-care, but it seems to have been for nothing. If you guys have any ideas at all as to what I can do to get myself out of this hole, please share. And if you've read it this far, I sincerely thank you.",11Dec2019,1

It didn't. I felt myself detach from the world, I was shaking and struggling to keep a steady breathing pattern. 

 It was like watching my life through another pair of eyes that were on my body. I was a living corpse, no expression, no nothing that communicated the fact that I was human beyond skin being on my body, breathing and moving. I tried to avoid my friends, It wouldn't have changed anything if I had hung out with them at the time, or really any time at all, but they still asked where I was, If I was okay and other things, I never answered those questions.  

I was confused as to why they asked me, around that time, I would barely speak and even when I did, the conversation was extremely stilted. So, I just took the questions as them putting me down and continued the rest of the week in solitude, waiting for it to go away and it did eventually.

82," Posted this in a few other places, interested to see what everyone thinks!

TL;DR - I wonder if Cluster B Personality Disorders are all the same disorder, on a spectrum.

I have Borderline Personality Disorder and I advocate for mental illness, especially Personality Disorders. In advocating, I have talked to so many people with Cluster B Personality Disorders, and was shocked to find so many similarities in our behaviors--even when it doesn't appear to be the same on the surface. I have honestly not encountered anyone with HPD, so, I can't speak for them.

I wonder if Cluster B Personality Disorders are all the same disorder that just exists on a spectrum. BPD, NPD, ASPD can all have antisocial or pro-social behaviors, they all can have high or low functioning sufferers, all can have classic or quiet symptoms, can all have vulnerability vs. grandiosity. We can all be victims or abusers, all have object permanence issues, we all seem to have an underlying trust issue, etc.

For instance, most of us have issues with identifying what we are feeling, or if we are feeling anything at all. Borderlines are known for feeling such intense feelings, but there are also times when we feel absolutely nothing at all. Narcissists seem like they could go either way, be very emotional or not be emotional at all and seems like even the same person can be both. People with ASPD are also capable of feeling emotions, but not very intense, and sometimes, I think they have the same problem where they are ""feeling"" something, but can't identify it, and don't consider it an emotion or feeling.

We all seem to get the edgy feelings inside us that we don't know how to identify, don't know what causes it, and we all know that we can do certain things to kind of make those feelings go away. Borderlines seem to attention-seek (which is sometimes a form of manipulation). Narcissists seem to manipulate. ASPD seems to manipulate. But it seems like some people with ASPD and NPD attention-seek through their manipulation. I think that a friend that I have with ASPD trolls online to get ""stimulation"" as he puts it, to fill that edgy feeling. I think that is almost a form of attention-seeking?

I think all of us feel nothing because during childhood development none of learned to identify what those feelings were. We feel sensations instead of emotions, but have no idea those sensations are actually caused by chemical releases and causing emotions. We feel an ""sensation,"" sometimes the edginess, and we behave in a way to make that sensation go away. We never learned appropriate coping skills as kids, and never learned to identify what those feelings were to fix them anyways, so we act impulsively, without regard to others, because we just need that feeling to go away. All three PDs have the impulsive element.

I think Borderline attention-seeking could be considered manipulative because we want superficial attention in those moments. We just want people to tell us they love us and they are there for us, and we move on because that shitty feeling goes away. That seems kind of manipulative. We are using people's compassion and empathy to make ourselves feel better. Because we never actually fixed the underlying problem that we were attention-seeking about, we continue to attention-seek. That's why that is such a repeated behavior. When we get real help for certain problems, we don't have attention-seeking problems in those areas.

Cluster B's, I learned recently, are all known for our object permanence issues. When people aren't a constant in our lives, we tend to forget about them and our feelings for them lessen. When they show back up, it's like they never left, we feel the same way we did about them previously, positive or negative.

We seem to all have underlying trust issues, which honestly seem to be what gets in our way of getting better. We can't trust anyone enough to tell them what we are actually thinking and feeling because it's so out there, or fucked up, or whatever, so we don't process that thought, and it never goes away. We never deal with it. I admitted a lot of things to my Favorite Person/partner (FP) recently, a lot about shitty behaviors I have had, and it gave me a tremendous amount of closure. He is the person I trust the most, but I still have trust issues around him. I trust him with my life, I know he would never do anything to hurt me, he is neurotypical, but I don't think I could ever just... trust him, even though I say I do. I also feel comfortable and trust him enough to ask questions about what is normal. I asked him, ""Is it normal to just not feel an emotion all the time?"" I assumed other people just always feel something, but apparently, they don't. Lol. Good to know. I asked him, do you always feel love for me? And he said he always loves me, but it's not a constant feeling. It's only when he thinks of me, or when something reminds him of me, or when I am around. I continued to ask him questions, and I figured out that my emotions, though seemingly limited and intense, aren't that irregular. Like, feeling nothing is normal. Feeling empty is not. I think the feeling empty is when there is an emotion or feeling there that we can't identify and don't know how to fix, and it's confusing for us to deal with. I think all disorders experience this on some level, but Borderlines are hard on themselves, so I think we feel empty, because we think really hard about it and dwell on it. Some NPD and ASPD folks do too, but seemingly not as much, but the ones that do seem to have feelings comparable to emptiness. Insightful and self-aware people with ASPD even seem to in their own way.

Pro-social, high functioning NPD and ASPD is known for being charming and intelligent and being able to lure people in so they can manipulate them. Well, manipulation in someone with a PD is a survival mechanism from childhood development, so? Borderlines don't get the same distinction because we are vilified the same way as NPD and ASPD, but when we are in a positive, stable mood, we are very likable. We are usually all very good at making friends, we just can't keep them. Can't maintain the friendships. NPD and ASPD are labelled as calculating, but you would be about a symptom that you developed during childhood? You'd be an expert by now. You are very good at what you do. So are Borderlines. We are also good at luring people in and making feel bad for us and emotionally manipulating them to get what we want. We don't do it to be mean, we do it because we need something and don't know how to ask for it. I think NPD and ASPD is the same, but less empathy development, so it comes off as malicious. Being charming and calculated doesn't fit the victim role that Borderlines tend to take on in life, so, we don't get that distinction. I think that's interesting. Especially because I have been told by multiple people, ""Well, yeah, if you're a hot girl with childhood sexual abuse, you are probably Borderline."" Misconception, but... still, perceived to be the hot girl who can lure people in.

I think that there *is* a spectrum, and there *is* different presentation, and all the genders *do* present differently, so it makes it look vastly different, but it's really not. We all do similar things for similar reasons. They just present differently. Also, you might say, well, there are certainly people out there who don't feel like I do? Who don't value the same things I do? Well, were the same things emphasized during childhood? In the same ways? Probably not. But I'm sure your disorder relates more with the people in your disorder who did. Especially the people in your category of your disorder.

People who didn't have any emphasis on empathy during their childhood wouldn't have any. If they didn't have emotional development, they *would* feel less than those who did. The areas of the brain grow as be learn empathy and emotion. I reckon that we have the same disorder with different development of brain structure do to learning and experience.

Some of us are very confident, some of us are not. Probably something to do with how we were treated during childhood, and then maybe even eventually how we were treated during adulthood and when we were testing boundaries, we developed new ""survival mechanisms"" that started to work in our new environment.

All our behaviors are there because they work. The ones from our old environment that stopped working, we stopped doing because they didn't get reinforced. I think we are always testing boundaries because we don't always know what is acceptable, and new things wind up working. All of our behaviors have been continuously reinforced by society, even unknowingly. This isn't an excuse. We do have control over our behaviors to a point. I think we *do* loose control when we are unstable because we have poor impulse control and we can't identify what is going on because things happen a lot faster when we are escalated. But, when we are stable, we *are* able to realize what we are doing and how it affects ourselves and others. Gaining insight helps in those moments. We can't control our personality, but we can control our behaviors.

I am mostly asking this because I want to raise points about trends in our behavior that mental health care professionals haven't noticed yet, to encourage research.

*This* is an exceedingly long post, but it mostly made additional points. If you want to see more of what I am figuring out, then read [this](https://sociallyunacceptable.blog/2019/12/10/theory-on-cluster-b-personality-disorders/). It's *very* long.

84," In April of 2015, I tried to kill myself. At first it was totally accidental but it became intentional. I was sitting in my rental house in Mexico, for the 3rd day without going outside. All the windows and doors were closed because I have the air conditioner on, I was baking potatoes. And I guess the pilot light in the oven went out somehow without me noticing. I was sitting at the dining room table watching something on my laptop and I started to feel dizzy, I thought it was because I hadn’t eaten in a day and a half. And then I smelled it. The gas. And I basically knew instantly what happened, and I sat there, getting dizzier, and I thought about it. I thought it was probably the best way to do it. Cutting myself was out, I’ve never liked pain. Falling asleep and never waking up seemed so easy. So quick. So painless. And I was going to let it happen. No one would have known I did it on purpose, it would have been a tragic accident. I wouldn’t have to live on this plain anymore and deal with the hurt and betrayal and sadness I was feeling all the time. It’s weight crushing me day after day. I just didn’t want to be HERE. Whatever that meant. I was dumb and young and had never really been hurt that way before, didn’t know that it was possible for the people you loved and trusted the most could turn on you and become so nasty so fast. It felt like my life had imploded in a day. I didn’t realize that could be possible. So I’m sitting there thinking all of this, thinking about how long it would take for anyone to actually notice. And then I saw him. My stupid cat. He was asleep on the couch. I couldn’t let this sweet little idiot die. And I ran to the big sliding glass doors opened them and threw myself into my tiny backyard and I breathed. And it was so hard to do that, to actually clear my head from the fuzziness. But I did it, and then I got up and shut off the oven. And maybe the gas wouldn’t have actually killed me, after all it was a big house and I have no idea how much gas would actually need pumped into the space for it to actually asphyxiate me. But the fact that I thought about it and was going to let it happen terrified me. To my core. God it scared me. For hours all I did was cry thinking about what I almost let happen.

86," In April of 2015, I tried to kill myself. At first it was totally an accident but it became intentional. I was sitting in my rental house in Mexico, for the 3rd day without going outside. All the windows and doors were closed because I had the air conditioner on, I was baking potatoes. And I guess the pilot light in the oven went out somehow without me noticing. I was sitting at the dining room table watching something on my laptop and I started to feel dizzy, I thought it was because I hadn’t eaten in a day and a half. And then I smelled it. The gas. And I basically knew instantly what happened, and I sat there, getting dizzier, and I thought about it. I thought it was probably the best way to do it. Cutting myself was out, I’ve never liked pain. Falling asleep and never waking up seemed so easy. So quick. So painless. And I was going to let it happen. No one would have known I did it on purpose, it would have been a tragic accident. I wouldn’t have to live on this plain anymore and deal with the hurt and betrayal and sadness I was feeling all the time. It’s weight crushing me day after day. I just didn’t want to be HERE. Whatever that meant. I was dumb and young and had never really been hurt that way before, didn’t know that it was possible for the people you loved and trusted the most could turn on you and become so nasty, so fast. It felt like my life had imploded in a day. I didn’t realize that could be possible. So I’m sitting there thinking all of this, thinking about how long it would take for anyone to actually notice. And then I saw him. My stupid cat. He was asleep on the couch. I couldn’t let this sweet little idiot die. And I ran to the big sliding glass doors opened them and threw myself into my tiny backyard and I breathed. And it was so hard to do that, to actually clear my head from the fuzziness. But I did it, and then I got up and shut off the oven. I’d like to say I did it for myself but that would be a lie. I did it for him.  And maybe the gas wouldn’t have actually killed me, after all it was a big house and I have no idea how much gas would actually need pumped into the space for it to actually asphyxiate me. But the fact that I thought about it and was going to let it happen terrified me. To my core. God it scared me. For hours all I did was cry thinking about what I almost let happen. I wasn’t better by any means, I still counted how many days until someone checked in on me (it was 4, by the way) not that that matters in any way. But that number has always stayed with me. 4 days before someone texted me, and then who know how many more before someone would have come to the door. I would have been lying there for days.

87,"Yesterday, I received a text from my girlfriend that she’s been hospitalized and that they’re taking her phone away overnight. I’m not sure what happened yet, but from what I figured out from the few texts we exchanged, it seemed like she harmed herself somehow in the morning and went to the ER in the evening and they sent her to the mental hospital. It’s really hard not knowing exactly what’s happening to your loved ones.

Last year, I ended the relationship with my ex girlfriend, who had some preexisting conditions and then a sudden psychosis hit her hard. We weren’t on bad terms and it still crushed me and I offered her support during those times.

I don’t blame any of them at all, but this is really tiring and emotionally hard to deal with. I’d really appreciate some support in the comments. I really had to get that off my chest. I’m not telling friends as I’m not sure if she’s okay with that yet.

88,"A few years ago, I was out with a friend and ended up drinking with an older man I used to work for. I was 22 at the time and he was late 30's I believe, hadn't hit 40 yet. He kept buying drinks for me and I was trying to keep up with everyone else but couldn't. All I can remember after the bar is stumbling out and getting into an uber with him and my friend's boyfriend driving my car home. I vaguely remember the Uber pulling into his driveway and then some vague memories of him on top of me and being in pain. 
I told my friend what had happened and she was mad to say the least. We lived together at the time so her boyfriend took my car back to our place thinking I'd be behind them. 
Over the next year, it turned into a dysfunctional sort of consensual relationship. He found out I had had a threesome in the past and was constantly pressuring me to find another girl to add. I turned down what probably would've been a good relationship with a guy I'd known for years for this man.
Looking back on it, the whole situation makes me feel ashamed and hate looking at my own body. I'm scared to get even tipsy in public anymore. I've read where people enter consensual relationships with partners that previously took advantage of them and identified with it somewhat. 
I guess my point in posting this is to ask if this is worth seeing a counselor for or what some other people's thoughts are.",11Dec2019,1

Hey guys, if somebody is looking for a good music, I would like to introduce myself, as I try to make music that helps other people out there who might struggle with mental health problems, music is my life kinda and it helps me a lot to cope with my bipolar disorder
Everybody who has ever felt suicidal, guys and girls your life matters and I believe that you just have to admit that you have the problem and try not to run from it but actually find a way to cope with it, it might be hard and it might seem unreal but your life is worth fighting for, also I can see that many people who have mental problems are quite good at art, even if it feels like it is not your thing, consider it as an option, when you feel down and you feel like you are full of bad emotions try to draw, write poems, lyrics or even try to play any musical instrument you have or try to make photos, it is a good way of relieving the pain instead of self-harm

I think I am entitled to be sad about it and even went as far as trying to get closure by typing out on my phone exactly how I feel and I have that saved. 

I haven't talked face to fave with her since the incident and likely won't talk to her for at least a week and I don't know how to feel about her.

I have had a few big changes go on in my life over the last year that I think are effecting me:

My wife has been signed off from working as she is suffering from depression. She’s sad a lot of the time and as much as I try to keep the house moving and give her space when needed and talk when needed I don’t feel like I’m helping her at all. Her issues are with her work and her boss but I can’t help but feel responsible for her feeling like this. I can’t help but feel like I could have done more or could be doing more. Or that I’m the problem but she isn’t ready to tell me yet. I haven’t said this to her as she is going through enough and I don’t want to make it about me. 

My daughter hasn’t been very well and is being treated for her Illness but the medication makes her feel poorly. At least this is being managed. 

I have got a new job that has some really good prospects but when signing up for the role I was told I’d be supported by my current manager to then be told 2 weeks in that she was being moved out of my team and we would be moved under a new manager. I’m now on my
Own in the role and am not getting any support as the new management do not understand the requirements. The job pays well but honestly I don’t think I’m the right person for the job and I feel like a fraud. 

I feel like I used to have loads of friends and family I could turn to but to be honest there not there when I need them and the ones that I have spoken to have been sympathetic but ultimately there answer is “hang in there” and “it will get better” or just tell you’re wife/work how you feel but that’s not really an option. My wife has enough going on and if I was to tell work how I feel I may not have a job in a few months time. There a large corporation that is in the middle of a big change and need capable people in seats not people that second guess there abilities.. Id be moved to another role and made redundant when the next lot of redundancy comes around.

That's another thing I really hate about depression, my brain just doesn't work properly. All logic leaves and I'm just left with irrational fear and doubts, even if you notice the irrationality your brain still makes you doubt it nonetheless. It's really exhausting to keep mysterious rational even with all the mess that's happening in my head.

I have been diagnosed with anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, and add. The anxiety is the major killer of me, it keeps me up at night and stemmed from childhood abuse. But this story doesn’t have a sad ending, yesterday i made the biggest step and hardest thing i’ve ever had to do and that was to seek help. I went into the doctors yesterday to speak about sleeping issues related to my anxiety and met the most wonderful nurse, she took my vitals and what not as well as supply a depression test, which i answered yes to almost every question. She leaves the room and i’m just sitting there kinda crying for a while and the doctors walks in, we start the usual talk but then we get into what i think about with all of my anxiety. I start to choke up as i try to explain, “well you know how we don’t know what happens in the future, i worry a lot about the future and dying, like will i ever be successful”, and at this point i’m just full blown tears not even able to look at my doctor, but yet he talks to me and unlike the help i’ve seemed before he talked to me like i was an adult and not a child, i actually felt comfortable talking. And anyone who suffers from mental illness or trauma knows it can be very difficult.

The reason i’m telling this story is to let everyone know there is hope no matter what age you are, it may feel like it’s impossible and i thought that too, it was one of the hardest and longest bumps in my life that i tried to ignore.

Earlier this year, I started a mental health podcast with a friend of mine. We've been through a lot of mental health struggles and being there for each other really made it easier to get through the adversities that life threw at us. One of the reasons that we created the podcast was because we just felt deep down like there had to be people that related to the things we were going through. We needed those people to know that they weren't going through it alone. We don't get much feedback on our episodes and wanted to hear from some people if the content was relatable and suggestions on future episodes. I think this is the best community to go to.

We would love to get feedback. Our Podcast is called **""Keep My Light""** and you can find it on any major place where people listen to podcasts. Spotify, Itunes, iHeart Radio, Google Music, etc. Let us know what you think, we would encourage constructive criticism.

107,"Memory is the mental function that enables you to acquire, retain, and recall sensations, impressions, information, and thoughts you have experienced.

Sensory Memory--Holds information coming in through the senses for a period ranging from a fraction of a second to several seconds
Long-Term Memory (LTM)--Holds information for a long period of time (almost permanently) with a virtually unlimited capacity

However, there are several additional types of memory.
*Implicit vs. explicit memory
*Declarative vs. non-declarative memory
*Declarative vs. procedural memory
*Semantic vs. episodic memory

Types of Short-Term Memory
Short-term memory is the information we are currently aware of or thinking about. It is the information that is held in our mind for a very short period of time before it is either dismissed or transferred to long-term memory. Working memory can be thought of a distinct segment of short term memory. It is a subpart of short-term memory applied to cognitive tasks that temporarily stores, organizes and manipulates information.
Types of Long-Term Memory
Long-term memory is our brain’s system for storing, managing, and retrieving information. We store different types of information (procedures, personal experiences, facts, language, etc.) in our long term memory.

There are three main distinctions among different types of memory:
Implicit vs. Explicit memory
Declarative vs. Procedural memory
Semantic vs. Episodic memory

Implicit vs. Explicit Memory
Implicit memory is information that is remembered unconsciously and effortlessly. Information unconsciously enters the memory to affects thoughts and behavior, thus allowing someone to do things by rote. It is where previous experiences aid in the performance of a task without conscious awareness of these previous experiences.
*Example: If you visited your aunt’s house when you were eight years old, then 20 years later you remember exactly how to get to the kitchen.
Explicit memory is conscious, intentional remembering of information. Basically, it is information that you have to consciously work to remember.
*Example: Remembering a phone number or an address.

Declarative vs. Procedural Memory
Declarative memory is recall of factual information such as dates, words, faces, events, and concepts.
*Example: Remembering the capital of Connecticut, the rules for playing football, and what happened in the last game of the World Series involves declarative memory.
(NOTE: Declarative memory is usually considered to be explicit because it involves conscious, intentional remembering.)
Procedural memory is recall of how to perform an action, task, or skill.
*Example: changing a light bulb or riding a bike
(NOTE: Procedural memory is usually considered implicit because people do not have to consciously remember how to perform actions or skills.)

Semantic vs. Episodic Memory
Semantic memory is recall of general facts.
*Example: Remembering the capital of New Jersey and the batting average for Jackie Robinson.
Episodic memory is recall of personal experiences.
*Example: Remembering what happened in the happened during a birthday party or baseball game.",11Dec2019,1

I’ve been to one therapist, but it was when I was still in highschool and I was forced to go to a tribe therapist (I’m Native American) that was free. This actually did help me out a lot, but I don’t live in the same area now and my tribe has no heath services here. I am now in my late 20s and although I can hold down a job and function in life I still go through waves of deep feeing hopeless depression. When this happens I want to reach out and speak with a professional, but even the online things like TalkSpace are $260 a month... I make decent money, but I can’t spare that on a monthly basis, and honestly I would only want to talk to them at my low points, not daily or even weekly. I have tried in person therapists a couple of times, but it feels like such a hassle to set something up with someone new and by the time I have my appointment, I may not be feeling as low. I just wish there were more casual options out there for those of us who just need to talk with a professional therapist, but don’t want to make such a financial commitment. In my opinion, we should all be encouraged to get any amount of mental health treatment.

114,"Not going to post many details, but I'm 25 and have been suffering from depression and PSTD due to bullying in my teenage years. Yesterday my boyfriend broke up with me on the phone while living on another country (we've been together for 7 years, I didn't have any relationship prior to this one and he didn't have one either) because, and I quote, ""I'm a very emotional person"". He tried to break up last month too while I was living with him and I had a panic attack and he said he can't stand that kind of episodes. I totally understand that but I think he's seeing me just as a depressed person, instead of seeing me for what I truly am.

He says he feels suicidal and he has constant urges to scratch himself to the point where he starts bleeding. He says he has also been to people to help him but it hadn't worked.

117,"I had terrible depression from the moment I conceived until about a month before delivery. So January - July 2019. Multiple suicide attempts. Feeling worthless, like I don't deserve to be on this earth. Feelings of guilt for leaving behind my toddler if I succeeded with the attempts.

Anyway, this post isn't about that.

I got much better, the depression left me almost completely.

Everything is wonderful now. Things are perfect, and I'm very happy and loved.

But I keep having flashbacks. Like a certain song will trigger me and put my mind to how I felt back then... And I am drenched in guilt, like, how could I leave my beautiful daughter? How could I possibly take my angelic baby with me if I left this world? And even though everything is okay now, I feel sad that I ever felt like that in the first place.

Am I having PTSD from my depression?

It was the lowest place I have ever been in my life and I never want to go there again. So why does my mind keep taking me back?",11Dec2019,1
118,"As the title says. I am a 28/male I was extremely emotionally/physically abused by my mom my whole life (just recently cut her out of my life in the last year) I’m pretty sure because of this every single day I have an overwhelming sense of fear even while doing mundane everyday things. Every night I get home from work I usually sit for at least 2 hours worried about getting fired. For no reason by the way, my boss has expressed my job performance has been terrific. 

Usually when this anxiety sets in I become to feel extremely hopeless and defeated and often start thinking about ending my life. I have attempted suicide about 4 years ago by duct taping a garden hose to the exhaust of my car and running in through the passenger window. It was the most peaceful time of my life. I remember sitting there for what seemed like hours, with the hose blowing hot air in my face before I fell asleep and felt this amazing sense of relief like weights lifted off my chest (kinda like floating through space). And it all ended with a audible boom and I woke up on my kitchen floor with my girlfriend (now wife) standing over me screaming and crying. I was mad at her for saving me, I still feel mad about it 4 years later. 

Of course she had me put in a psych ward on a 72 hour hold. While in there I fed them whatever crap they wanted to hear so I could get out and finish the job. Obviously they knew my plan because they kept me for an extra 24 hours. After getting out I quit drinking alcohol all together and haven’t touched drugs since either. 

I’ve kept up on seeing my medications, seeing physician and counselor. But now I’m at the point now I feel like I’ve been through every medication and nothing works. The only things that keep me going are my amazing wife, that for some reason deals with my pathetic, self loathing behavior and my perfect little daughter, and I feel terrible she has such a broken father.

I’m scared to express my feelings to my wife for fear that I’ll get locked up in the hospital again, but at the same time, I feel like I’m one push away from the edge so maybe it would be best for me..  

Any advice? Should I be honest with my wife? Or go back to my doctor and explain my mental health is further deteriorating?",11Dec2019,1
119,"I've been diagnosed with structure of BPD, the BPD, traits of BPD, narcissism traits (inability to feel able to be loved and narcissic faults), dysthymia, adhd (psychiatrist said so, therapist believe it's the personality disorder) and eating disorder (bulimia). I used to have generalized anxiety disorder and social phobia. I've had an eating disorder for 17 years (5 years of anorexia, 12 years or bulimia). 

I've been on three sick leaves recently : one in March 2017 following an abusive relationship, April 2019 after trauma from a rape made me dysfunctional, and in September 2019 during a bad relationship (I haven't mentioned that one to any doctor, I was just sad and disconnected, in some trauma state because he reminded me so much of my rapist).

I've tried many meds, not many worked well. I have a stash of rivotril I keep just in case, and I use Vyvanse 40mg and Lexapro 10mg now. I take GABA at times. It's a new prescription, I refused meds for some years after it made me worst. I tried many before, Rexulti made me compulsively shop and I ended up 6k indebted. 

I also drink to remove the anxiety when I'm with people or even just to have sex. I was developing an alcohol problem before taking the meds. I don't take drugs unless someone give me some. 


I have my friends that I trust (no issues ever else we just talk it out), my work colleagues (good relationship except when I reject romantically someone), my family, my older brother with who I have history of abuse. My family is dysfunctional, we're chaotic and it's a enmeshed family pattern in which my mother and my brother have a toxic relationship. I'm kind of apart from them, they let me do my thing and they respect me for my decisions (I changed legally my first name recently).

I have history of abuse and trauma related to intense bullying and also rape. I've been with a sociopath and a BPD guy. I've also been with a normal guy for 3.5 years. After that normal relationship, I dated intensively for about two years and then calmed down. I was raped three weeks ago by the same rapist (the sociopath) as last year. I've been disconnected ever since. 

I'm a woman that looks confident. People say I look sane mostly, maybe a little bit anxious about what people think of me. I have low social stamina so I often stay by myself else I become very tired. When I'm angry, I put it into words. No outbursts, rarely triggered, often more reflective and I can get argumentative when logic is involved. Most of the time, I'm laid-back. My friend say I don't put my limits with other people that disrespect me. I try to, but it takes me time to voice it out. Sometimes, I wonder if I'm not the problem and that it's just my perception of things, which is why I kept my sociopath rapist in my life for months after what happened. I felt guilty and he kept telling me I was not safe / didn't see how much of a good guy he was. I believed him. 

When I date, I keep a distance between myself and the other person. I keep secrets, I never share everything. The guy I'm seeing right now doesn't know I'm on a sick leave or on medication or even that I was raped recently. I like him well enough, but I don't want him to pity me or to judge me. 

I'm often telling my therapist that I can't be borderline. It doesn't make any sense, but they all say it does because of my dysthymia and eating disorder. I have issues with the label because I don't recognize myself in the diagnosis. I used to be in a specialized place for personality disorders and I left because I didn't feel like mentalization helped me much. The current treatment is psychodynamic so I'm gonna give it a shot.  He's helping me to structure my life (food times, when to do grocery shopping, walking once a day, etc.) because of the apathy, I don't feel like doing anything. 

I live alone with my two cats, I pay for my things on time and I try to keep my apartment sorted. I have the same work goal and objective for years but it seems I can't attain it because of my energy levels and motivation levels and the depressive state I'm in. I sleep ok, I'm mostly fine except for this dreadful depression that eats away at me and my desire to live. And the diagnosis is killing me slowly, since I try to help myself out by reading on the internet and looking at studies. I thought I was bipolar, PTSD, gifted, sociopath, etc... I would like some of your insight based on what I wrote. Thank you. 

Tdlr : I'm not sure if the BPD diagnosis fits me. Maybe it did in the past, but I can't see why it does now. My therapist says it's because I have dysthymia and bulimia. I'm looking for insight on the matter. Thank you.",11Dec2019,1
120,"Welp. I went to family therapy to try to work out all the demons caused by my parents for covering up my brothers repeated violent sexual assault of me when i was a child from the ages of 5-14. Our family had always unusual dynamics, that much was clear, a genre of abuse could be spotted with some time spent around my parents. And not the masks they put on for the guests. Their true, screaming “YOU BRING ME NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS, YOURE DESTROYING THE FAMILY, I WISH I NEVER HAD KIDS, I WISH I WAS DEAD.” selves.

We went to therapy and I had suspected the truth but I could not believe it until I had confirmation. My brothers abuse has been hid from everyone in his life including his wife. To ask an oblique question I asked my mom, “What would you do if you found out Dad was a pedohpile?” My question was to her but my eyes were on him. 

The shock.

My heart sank.

I gave my brother an out not an excuse to explain the chain of abuse. 

“Did dad sexually assault you?” Crawled out of me. 

“Yes.”

It was the weakest, most pathetic thing I had ever seen. But it was the truth. I had worn down their defences. I am going no contact with two people now. My mom is a victim of abuse herself but grew up in the 50’s and also had her story brushed aside. That set an example for her. She’s now brushed aside her husbands and sons acts knowingly just to keep the family reputation. I was the sacrifice for the cogs.

I've tried to kill myself multiple times, and i started self harming, got caught by my parents, stopped for a while, then had a breakdown and cut again (i didn't realize what i was doing at that moment until i saw blood, you can say i felt like i couldn't control my body, my mind went black for a moment). mom went through my phone a month later, and found out that i self harmed again. she sat me down and we decided that it would be better if i went and saw a therapist. 

i am not against that, in fact, I've wanted to go and talk to a specialist for a long time now, i know i need it. but im too nervous. i begin shaking everytime i think about it. and i feel uncomfortable. if i can't trust the closest person to me with some things, how am i gonna trust a complete stranger? i know that they are specialists and that it's their job, but i can't even say my name infront of even my friends without making mistakes, so how am i gonna feel comfortable talking about the deepest things infront of them? plus im pansexual (my family is homophobic), and i don't think i can tell my therapist about it because what if she tried to tell my parents about it?

But i have has a lot of great times with them too and i figured it was just petty young kids and everyone was just mean to each other. however since college ive made new friends but way less friends than before but and for the most part they are good people and i have had so many fun times with them and sometimes even my high school friends during college. however through college i will still have some drama with highschool friends when i see them every once in a while and its so frustrating because i just wanna have no bad blood but something always comes up because theyre FULL of drama. and as i get older i get more busy and for a while i didnf hit up college friends first and i realizes they stopped talking to me like if i didnt make the first move then they wouldnt hit me up. 
then this situation happened(im not gonna say)where I got reminded again how my college friends werent really making an effort it was always me and also gotSuper hurt by what my highschool friends did to me (basically ignored me and left me out and embarassed me on one of the most imp days of my life) . this was the last straw then i started cutting peoe off and unfollowing them and removing numbers because i really dont wanna keep putting myself in situations where im gonna be hurt by the aame people. 

but the thing is now the only person who talks to me is my bf and hes my only friend and that scares me feeling so dependent on one person. and i feel like so weird like ive been through a lot with my friends and i jist want new friends who will be there for me and not make me feel so bad. i want to start over completely and forget about my past friends or any friends i have made so far because i am starting a new chapter in my life soon, so do yall think its healthy to just cut off those people who i feel like arent genuine even if that means i have no friends? i will try to make a better effort to make mew friends soon when j atart that chapter and now ive learned from my past mistakes on also how to be a good friend. 

but rn i feel alone like really alone but also ita comforting better than being ariund people who arent genuine. i forgive people a lot so it takes a lot for me to give them up but i really cant rake the mental pressyre anymkre and i feel terrible like cutting people off because of the long history, not that they even notice or care. i have decided to completely cut off people who have constantly make me feel bad and reassess anyone who makes an effort to me first(give another chance) i feel so alone but i feel like its better this way?

123,"This is a bit long.

Back in school I was bullied from the second grade to the sixth.
I first planned to kill myself in the fourth grade, because I just coudn't take it anymore. I never actually attempted it, but I planned my suicide and wrote most of the note before deciding against it.
The second time I planned to kill myself was a bit over a year later. This time I didn't write a note and went as far as to tying a belt to the bedpost of my bunkbed.
After the sixth grade I switched schools and the bullying stopped. However I have not since tried to make friends, since talking with others was difficult and trusting others was even harder. 
Things went somewhat smoothly for a year or so. And then I started to not really feel anything. 
It has been about 5 years and I just don't feel anymore. I get flashes of anger but they don't last long. I can't rememver the last time I felt a positive feeling. I still laugh and smile, but there is no feeling attached anymore. I constantly feel empty. I used to want to find something that would make me happy, but now I've lost that aswell.
I have no feelings, wants, desires or anything. I don't care about anything anymore and can't deal with the stress of trying to help with my younger siblings, school, working part-time and keeping up with work around the house.
My few friends have started to ask me if I'm okay a lot. I can't bring myself to tell them that during the past month or so, I've been thinking about suicide again. I don't want to tell them, because I don't want to seem weak. I've always tried my best to make sure that they're doing well and try and help them as well as I can.

124,"My SO has been going to a therapist for the past two months. From what I've heard about this therapist, the therapist seems very competent, my SO also seems to find value in the sessions. 

I was very happy with this arrangement (I had been encouraging my SO to seek professional help for a long time and she seemed to finally be taking it seriously) until she came back with a list of action items for me to take ""from her therapist"". I use the quotes because I don't really know whether these action items are coming from my SO or her therapist.


Either way I am upset with this, because whether or not these action items are needed, **her therapist has never talked to me**.

I know that my SO complains about me to her therapist (she complains about just about everyone and everything, and unfortunately, I am the only person she spends a significant amount of time with), but this in it self does not bother me. That is between her and her therapist. 

However, I feel those complaints need to stay between her and her therapist for those complaints to continue to be none of my business. 

I feel like she is going to couples counseling without me present to share my side of the story, and this makes me feel upset and betrayed.

*Is me feeling upset by this rational?*

I would also like to request that we go to this same therapist for a couples session.

I have requested this in the past as this therapist also does couples counseling, but my SO said it was a bit of a conflict of interest for her therapist, so I relented. However, with the action items brought back, I am reevaluating the value this claim, and am starting to think my SO would just like to continue to only present her side of the story.

125,"Hello everyone,  


So I'm in a bit of a conundrum and I'm looking for some advice. I do my best to be reasonable but I'm always concerned I'm making the wrong choice. I am codependent and have a very bad habit of giving people the benefit of the doubt and staying in poor relationships even when I should leave.  


I have a counselor I've been seeing for about 6 months and we're finally getting into some of the nitty gritty of my life in an effort to help me heal and become more of the person I want to be.   
We were working on this exercise and I recalled an experience I had with my mother who kicked me out of the house for joining a friend (we were both 18) for a free exotic dance class. My mother claims a friend had seen us enter the location but I have a feeling she was following me (she had a creepy habit of doing this). Anyways, as my mother was kicking me out she told me that if I became an exotic dancer I would eventually be forced to provide sexual favours for her Ex boyfriend (my childhood sexual abuser). I've always viewed this as her threatening me a sort of ' if you do this, this is what's going to happen to you' type of thing.  


My counselor seemed to latch onto a different idea and wouldn't really listen when I tried to explain I really don't think that was the situation. She seemed to think that I was trying to say, or maybe my mother was saying that my mom wanted this to happen? That my mother wanted me to end up doing these things? To 'get pleasure for her boyfriend'.

I tried to correct her but when I feel like I'm not being listened to I tend to give up after a few attempts of trying to explain what I felt was actually going on. I shut down as I am really not interested in fighting or spending a large amount of time trying to change someone's opinion. I would really prefer for her to understand what the situation really was as I really don't feel her idea of the situation is what it was.   


I don't know, this feels like an important thing to get right. I don't think she did it on purpose, counselors are people, and people make mistakes. I'm just concerned about not being properly heard because I don't want to be misunderstood and have that negatively affect my treatment.   


I know not correcting this will always be looming over out appointments and be on my mind. I'm just not really sure how to proceed forward. To address it if it comes up again? Just leave it alone? Change counselors to someone I feel is able to properly listen to important information and is open to understanding my point of view and experience?  


Any advice on how to move forward would be appreciated.",11Dec2019,1

134,"Alright, so it's going to be a bit complex because I'm feeling a range of emotions all at once and it's very eugh, if that makes sense. So let me separate this a bit:

1) I'm getting frustrated very easily and I lose my mind when someone yells at me. All I can do it bit my hand and punch my thigh out of anger because I can't do other things. I'm more of someone who prefers to break something or just something that uses a lot of energy. I can't do any of that and I'm restricted because I'm in a new house and my parents are very picky on furniture and complain about slamming doors (even though my dad does that often????) and I don't have anything to punch but get it out on myself. Though I do admit that my temper has improved over the years (last year was pretty bad because I had mental breakdowns quite often).

2) I'm getting that dissociation issue again and my school counsellor says that my brain has learnt that method and is using it to cope. I can agree that it is useful to a certain extent, but I personally experience it almost every day and I find it hard to deal with. I don't even know what's a good coping method with anxiety. Apparently me yawning and dissociating is a good way even though it doesn't do much. I'm almost done with my emotional resilience group and when I'm done I'm going to try get longer counselling outside of school for my dissociation. Today it was very harsh. It was because I was cold and tired. I was confused on how I was able to speak and felt really off. Not to mention I struggled to remember how I got halfway home. I struggled in a way where the visual was poor and it sort of made me think it was a fake memory. 

3) I'm incredibly stressed and I don't know how to deal with it, because these techniques where I have to breathe in and out don't seem to reduce it. I have my maths mocks exams tomorrow and on Friday and I really am stressed. I'm supposed to be revising, but I felt the need to get this off of my chest. I also did a science test but I had to be moved to the foundation papers because I did really bad on my last two tests and I'm really stressed that I will fail this one as well.

I know this isn’t normal, but I don’t think there is actually anything wrong with me. However, I told a close friend about this &amp; she keeps telling me I need to talk to my mom or someone that it’s beyond not normal. Is this really something I should be 100% concerned with &amp; really truly need to go talk to someone about? I don’t think I do. I know it’s not “normal”, but I don’t think it’s a mental disorder either.

Since I was about 5 or 6 every time I’m scared, sad, frustrated, stressed, anxious, just any emotion, even just really happy, I talk to a psychiatrist in my head. (idk if he is a psychiatrist, I’m just assuming) It’s a normal looking psychiatrist office, desk, chairs, couch, coffee table, bookshelves, plants, etc. Obviously, as I’ve aged the décor has changed. Like when I was 6 there were toys such as stuffed animals, table to color. Now it’s more modern &amp; has little baskets with different textured clothes, little wooden 3d puzzle cube things, just something for me to fiddle with in my hands. ANYWAYS, so I go to the room &amp; the doctor who I always have just called Doc &amp; talk to him. Doc has never changed, has very rarely ever moved. He normally always sits in his chair caddy corner across from the couch. A few times he has gotten up to come to me or get something or make me stop fidgeting, but usually he sits in his chair.

Sometimes I talk to him for a couple minutes, sometimes it’s hours, sometimes I don’t even talk. I just grab something to fiddle with, sit cross legged in the middle of the couch &amp; just sit there. Sometimes for 10 minutes sometimes for 3 hours. When I don’t talk he just sits in his chair &amp; reads, looks at me every once in a while, that’s it. When I do talk, he just asks questions. &amp; the time passes in my head as it does in real life. I will go lay in my bed or sit in the recliner eyes open or closed it doesn’t matter &amp; just go to session with him. 

I can go to bed at 9:30 &amp; my brain just auto puts me in the room with him &amp; I talk about the day or upcoming things, idk just stuff, &amp; next thing I know I look at the clock &amp; it’s 12:37am. I don’t really control the time, there isn’t a set time. It’s like the actual room knows when it’s time to end. The alarm on his desk will start to ring &amp; that’s the end of the session. Like I said sometimes it’s 2 minutes &amp; sometimes it’s 4 hours &amp; anything in between. I don’t say ok I’m done. Once the alarm goes, I know I’m done. I always do feel much calmer, relaxed, better, less scared, or less whatever emotion it was before. I can picture the room right now. But I can’t just go in there anytime I want to. If I try to go, I guess without needing to go, nothing is focused, the room &amp; him is all blurry. The room is only opened when I need it, I guess I don’t know how to explain it, even when I don’t know I need it, it just pops in my head &amp; I’m like yeah I need this now. It can happen a couple times a day, a few times a month, or I can go a few months without a session.  

I’m not stuck in the room, like if someone comes &amp; talks to me I hear them &amp; interact with them in the real world, just in my head I’m still in the room. I usually stay unless it’s literally something I have to 100% focus on then I leave the room &amp; go back later. If I didn’t finish a session then the door is always open to go back until it’s finished. I don’t think it’s crazy.  I don’t think it’s another person in my head. It’s just me having a vivid imagination and talking everything out to get to the root cause of my emotion &amp; then fixing it or working through whatever. Or my version of meditating maybe. But apparently, this isn’t an ok thing, and my friend seems genuinely worried.

tldr: I've talk to a psychiatrist in my head since I was 5 or 6 &amp; my friend thinks I'm probably crazy.",11Dec2019,1

What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash? You get what you fucking deserve!

- Arthur Fleck


To all the people that have disadvantaged me in my short 21 year life.

The men who refused to be my Freinds.

The beautiful women who refused to be in relationships with me.

The teachers who bullied and ridiculed me.

My own family who has made me the black sheep I am.

This is the reason why I feel this way.

And to the society that did truly abandon me and treated me like trash. 


In many ways I am the real Arthur fleck, a sad man who just wanted to be loved and make the world laugh, but like him I was abandoned and forsaken destined to a life of being the black sheep and the outcast. For all intents and purposes I am Antonio, it’s not my real name as I would prefer not to be caught before I do anything rash. For my entire life I have been the outcast and the one that nobody wanted to deal with, people would rather make fun of me and dehumanize me all because I was different and I couldn’t help it. Unfortunately I was born with Asperger’s syndrome and it has made my social life a nightmare, because of my Aspergers it has made me mentally about 3 or so years behind my peers and growing up and even to this day I was rejected by other male friends as they thought I was weird, even though I was quite friendly and welcoming with them. For many years I was so lonely I had a imaginary friend who take the various forms of stuffed animals such as a sock monkey and a toad plush and this behaviour continued till I was 12 years of age. In grade 8 my first year of highschool I was completely rejected by male peers to such a extant that I was completely ignored and my only friend became a librarian who welcomed me with open arms and was a very kind man to me. Throughout highschool I was rejected by other males socially and they wouldn’t even give me the time of day to be real Freinds and at best they would enter short conversations with me. Women have regularly ignored me or have acted disinterested in me, with only a handful of women finding me attractive and at most times they aren’t super attractive which is weird because I am good looking but the good looking ones constantly reject me. I am not bad looking I have wavy brown hair, I’m 6,3 and I have a little weight but in my photos I look big, as in 
tall with wide shoulders, I am told I am handsome by older women peers ( aged 27 - 50 ) and I have heard through the grape vine that several people in my life thought I was good looking, so I could never understand why I was rejected. These women always have stupid and odd excuses for not dating me, it’s almost like they are just being polite to me and don’t want to offend me, they claim that I am good looking and nice and or sweet but then they will hit me with, your too young ( female who said this was only a few years older ) or I liked you in highschool but then they get vague about their feelings now. A dirty slut one time dared to say to me that I was the kind of guy that only got a girl in his mid to late 20s after they were done with the chads and the party years and wanted to settle down with being the “nice guy” the hot women that I have talked to have let off a air of “you should be lucky to speak to me mere peasant, I’ll only date you when I have had a train run on me and I need stability” for the record I am not a typical womanless male, I have kissed girls, I have done hookups with three girls ( only getting to feeling and oral ) I have felt tits on many occasions but I have done pretty much everything except put my penis in a vagina, I am a virgin yes but I have at least done some things. Two of these women wanted to have sex but I considered them unworthy of taking my virginity as they were ok looking at best, not really being fat but just not being the 8-10 top tier quality girl that would be worthy of sleeping with me and taking my virginity. The woman I have had a crush and strong love feeling for since I was 9 ( were both 21 ) is dating a typical jock chad asshole who just has a nice face, met the guy briefly and he is a total ego high jock idiot and I wish I could just shoot him in the face until all was left was a bit of brain stem. What sickens me is that I know he only likes her for her body and it frustrates me that she is with him and not me who has been a family friend for years and I even liked her so much even when she was fatter it didn’t bother me, I found her beautiful, kind, sweet and funny. I would love to confess my love for her and date her and treat her with the love and respect I have for her but she still chooses to be with this jock looser over me who would love her with all my hearts content. Honestly I have thought about just leaving her a letter in her room when I came to visit her confessing my love for her and how much I admire her and if her goof boyfriend got in the way I would kill him either by poison or by hitting him super hard over the head with a baseball bat. My anger issues at women is that they have rejected me for no reason and I can’t figure it out, I was the nice guy they always claim they want, I was the nice guy they wanted to love and treat them like they were the princess they deserved to be. But no longer,That guy is dead and now I have become a angry man who now only sees them for the one good thing that they provide, and that is truth be told is sex. Sex controls everything it can break up years long friendships and cause a male to spend hundreds if not thousands just to get it, and women have a monopoly over it and will and have used it many many times against poor unsuspecting males. This is no different to me as the hotter women use their good looks and sex for the fun jocks and rich suckers and they think they can decide to give it to me or not when they want and I am saying no more to that bullshit. All this anger and resentment has caused me to be more cautious around women, knowing that most of them are no good users who only have their only intents in their hearts to use the men they sleep with as puppets, and I haven’t allowed myself to be a victim of this non stop cycle that really screws men over. Before I conclude I do not hate women at large, a lot of my positive role models throughout my life have been women, for example my mom and godmother have been amazing people in my life and have provided me with much love and support, and from time to time I have seen really lovely young women who haven’t let feminism and selfish needs ruin them. 


“ I started a joke which started the whole world crying, but I didn’t see that the joke was on me, I started to cry which started the whole world laughing, oh if I’d seen that the joke was on me” 


- some lyrics from a Bee gees song 


My anger and frustration is with the world itself and it’s population of people which at best is 95% awful people and those rare few people that have been super kind and supportive. Because of who I was the world rejected me and made me feel like a reject and a black sheep, the people made fun of me and outcasted me. The teachers wouldn’t support me so they neglected me rather than helping me with my Aspergers and learning disabilities, in turn the students bullied me and made fun of me, and in turn from my social rejection I akpcted strange which caused me to be rejected by society at large. Sometimes you have to laugh at and with the pain and to overcome my loneliness and rejection I became funny, I learnt to do voices and impressions and stand up and it gave me such a happy feeling to see those around me laugh and get joy off of my weird and funny antics, and it felt ever so rewarding to get a little recognition. I did my standup In school a couple of times and even publicly preformed in public in such places like downtown just to get a couple laughs or if I was stuck you get discovered by a passing agent. My dream would to be famous, and be loved and have the recognition I deserve, I have many talents including singing, impressions, script writing, stop motion knowledge, movie making skills, song writing skills and of course writing in general which has always been a passion of mine. I would love to become famous as not only as a way to demonstrate my skills but as a huge f*ck you to all the people who doubted and made fun of me throughout my life. I would love to live in a big fancy house and go to work at a studio and make movies all day, go to red carpet premieres and screenings and chill with celebrities. I would love to have a life where those who were good to me got to enjoy the rewards of being my friend’s and I would spend my life with those few people who were actually kind to me. I would love to have a few beautiful model girlfriends who I would beat and smack around taking out all of my hatred and hurt feelings of being abandoned and neglected by girls like them in my youth and I would get pleasure off of them being and feeling the pain that I had been in. With those who were bad to me I would love to flip them off and rub my success in their faces and I would love to make characters in my  movies that were based off of them who were killed off in horrific ways. It’s funny when a society treats people like worthless garbage and they expect us to be kind and wonderful people, but that’s not true all it’s bred inside of me is hatred, anger and resentment and a harsh craving for revenge against those who have wrong done me. This society that made me feel like the black sheep will soon pay for what it has done to me and pushed me down and making me feel this way, it will pay for the fact that it rejected me all because I had mental health issues and just wanted to be loved and get the respect and recognition I deserve. 


The problems started when I was a boy 

I was born to upper middle class parents, my father who owned several business and money making schemes and my hard working mom who was a insurance seller and then a real estate agent. In the world I would have a older brother who I have very little pleasant memories with and would be a major thorn in my side. As I said earlier I was born with Asperger’s syndrome and this gave me learning and slight anger issues that would constantly plague me throughout my life. I would be miserable from the very beginning of school, because of my learning challenges the teachers rejected me and in turn the students rejected me. School especially at my catholic school was a very lonely place for me. Because of my learning challenges I would constantly either move or be kicked out of school which caused a great deal of pain and sorrow in my life along with feelings of rejection, it wouldn’t be until Grade 10 that I would go to a private school for kids with LD’s that I would feel like I some what belonged. Instead I tried to make my self happy by drawing, trying to make people laugh and my lifelong obsession with LEGO, which would help me overcome so many challenges. At home my life was pretty lonely however like all of my life I did always have one or two really strong and good friendships and one continues to this day as he is my best friend. I was put into hockey at the age of five and I was a excellent skater however I hated the sport aspect of it and I just wanted to skate or at least get into some kind of competitive skating league of some sorts, but I was bullied by my brother and my dad who said it would be gay and or girly to get into something like that. My mother was a strong pillar of support through my life and constantly gave me positive encouragement throughout my life and she continues to be such a amazing person that I am grateful for having. Another shitty thing in my life was my parents constantly fought, sometimes violently and there was a constant tension and sense of a very broken home, me and my mom would move out for a few months at a time but we would come back and the problems would always resume. As of this writing my parents are getting along ok with a few genuine nice moments and are living under the same roof but there is a slight tension and lovelessness you can feel in the air, and you know a final marital separation is imminent. Growing up as a boy I never really had a super excellent male role model other than my uncle ( my mother’s brother ) who is a kind man but I rarely saw him, my father was rarely there emotionally during childhood he was always out doing more important things with work and stupid hobbies like fixing cars rather than bonding with me and the few times we would talk was when we would pick me up from school and he constantly sounded disinterested in what I had to say, and a few times he would get mad at me and hit me on the back of the hand with his hand. I will never fully hate him as at least he worked hard and put a roof over my head ( several if you count the lake house ) I always had bitter feelings towards him as I never felt loved by him and he was at times cold towards my mom. I do share a very few genuine happy memories with him such as a road trip
To drumheller Alberta, catching my first trout, getting my drivers licence with him and going to the suspension bridge. My mom on the other hand is a very loving woman and is very kind to me, she is a good friend and I share many many happy memories with her and I would do anything for her. Throughout my life I have struggled with abandonment issues as many people in my life have left me such as friends and peers who no longer wanted anything to do with me, and this has hurt me badly. I have also had many family members pass away over the course of my life ( most from cancer ) and it haunts me that they are not here from time to time, I miss them and it tortures me that I may never see them again. To deal with my pain I don’t drink, smoke or gamble I either turned to good food or collected things I liked, but most of the times I turned to collecting and having hobbies with things that I liked. My bedroom at home is filled with the many things that I have hobbies in or just made me happy during sad and lonely times. 

The few positives.

I have a best friend ( who for this writing I will call malcom )  who I trust and love 100% he is loyal to me and I would do anything for him, what I love about him is that he is one of the few people who accept me 100% and for that I am forever grateful to him. We hang out lots and we have like 90% of the same interests and we have lots of fun together, we have both come to accept that we are outcasts and we love that about ourselves and in turn we become a bit of a comedic duo. I have known malcom for all of my life as our moms have been  best freinds long before either of us were born. I have another best friend who I really enjoy ( met him at school he also has Aspergers ) me and him have lots of fun together as we have pretty much the same hobbies and we both have similar lives however he is much much wealthier than me. I like him a lot but I don’t trust him 100% as he has said comments that have made me doubt his loyalty. In many ways I have come to accept that I am a outcast and I try my best to make that aspect about myself shine and in turn it makes me unique which I guess I have learned to love about myself. I see myself as a bit of a loner but I also see myself as a unique and eccentric person who at least try’s to make the world laugh and entertained with my ideas and antics. Because of my families wealth I get to enjoy a few privileges such as having a wonderful lake house, vacations and property in Europe and from time to time getting the materialistic the things that I desire. Not to mention I do enjoy the few people in my life that make me genuinely happy, including my mom, my best friends and my two wonderful dogs, these people have made my life at least some what enjoyable and I enjoy every moment I spend with them. One thing I am happy about in my life is my escapism that gets me out of my sometimes hard to deal with reality, I even from time to time LARP with my best friend malcom for hours on end ( usually historical events or sci fi ) 


Revenge 


One way I would love to get revenge would be getting famous and rubbing it in all the doubters, haters and  of those who abandoned or forsaken me in my life. 

But in all seriousness I have contemplated more serious and violent ways. And trust me I consider this.

I figure if and when I reach my breaking point I am gonna grow my hair and dye it green and dye my face in the Jaoquin Phoenix’s jokers makeup and buy the suit then go on a revenge spree with no feeling and or guilt to those who have wrong done me. 

I would 

Leave a letter to my friends and family explaining why I did this 

Attempt to kill a few assholes from school 

Kill my at least two or three of former abusive my teachers 

Burn down my old catholic school with gasoline and home made molotovs 

Burn down my public school that I attended from grade 6-7 

Kill that stupid prick who dares to date the love of my life. 

Embrace my love of my life and tell her I love her. 

Get drunk off of my ass and then shoot myself watching a wonderful sunset once my goal was complete


 Ofcourse to the police who may be reading this, this is a hypothetical situation. 


For my whole life I didn’t know if I even really existed.... but I do and people are starting to notice. 

It’s funny cause for most of my life I felt alone and that nobody got what it was like then I had came into contact with other frustrated males and I saw people like Elliot Rodgers who had gone through similar rejection and troubles throughout their lives. Then on October 4th 2019 I saw a movie that forever touched me on a emotional level and that movie was joker, at it forever changed me it sent a message that was clear as day and it spoke to me to such a degree that I teared up multiple times and cried at the end when he got his revenge and he finally got accepted by those around him, that he got revenge on the society that abandoned and treated him like trash. I love that movie as it spoke to me and it has inspired me to finally do something about my anger towards the people and society who have treated me the way they have.Don’t be surprised if I do anything crazy, the world made me this way you beat me down until I had to claw to keep myself 
sane as the joker says all it takes is one bad day right? One bad day to make ourselves crazy. All I wanted was to be loved and given some attention and recognition but you denied me it and  I have put up with 21 years of loneliness, abuse and rejection and now it will be my time for me to have my revenge.",11Dec2019,1

146,"I personally see a therapist to cope with trauma and anxiety left from my last relationship. I believe therapy would be  helpful to everyone since we all struggle with coping and let's be honest - nobody is perfect. Nothing better than having a unbiased, third party opinion to hold a mirror up to yourself on a weekly or bi-weekly basis.

My current bf of 7 months was in a previous relationship of two years that he describes as abusive. His ex would gaslight, stonewall, threaten suicide and blackmail him constantly. 

I am very proud of him for escaping that torment, but unfortunately it has left him with some scars of the past. He struggles with sexual and emotional anxiety and fears that I will breakup with him when we get into civil disagreements about our relationship. I've encouraged conversations about expressing our needs, wants, boundaries in the relationship so we can respect them. He doesn't really have much input, actually he stated that he ""doesn't have any boundaries"" (I am aware this is very unhealthy) but happily agrees to me spearheading the discussion anyway. When we have disagreements, his ex comes up so often it makes me fear that maybe I'm similar to her but we're obviously two different women. 

I have been very open and honest about my mental health with him. He doesn't know the content of my sessions but he understands that I go to heal and to better myself. I've alluded to the fact that I think it would benefit him to see a therapist himself a few times. 

Recently, I offered the idea of therapy to him again, and his quotes were ""all they're gonna do is tell me my feelings are validated"" and ""talking about my problems won't help, I can just do it myself""

He handles his emotions internally but it appears he can't cope since he brings up his ex often, he suffers from relationship anxiety, has no clear boundaries for me to honor and has poor self-esteem. Sometimes he even fully just shuts down or tries to avoid talking about his feelings all together.

I really am doing my best to help him relieve his anxieties about sex, relationship, romance and have him understand that its us against the world, not us against each other.  But I can't help 100% of the time all the while I'm helping myself too. What can I say to him that would show him signs of his need for professional help? Keep in mind he is a “information” vs “feeling” person so if you have any links or pamphlet guides that would be helpful.

TL;DR: bf had an abusive ex that left him with emotional and sexual trauma that he needs to work on but is convinced he doesn't need professional help. It's affecting our relationship during disagreements. Need help to show him that therapy can help and he may definitely need it to help him cope.",11Dec2019,1

150,"I really don’t want this to seem like I’m trying to grab for attention but I don’t know where to go from where I’m at.

I’m classified as a Junior in college, last year having been very tough. I failed two classes because I never could motivate myself to go to class or start on anything. Every new task assigned felt like it added another brick to a wall keeping me from success. Every day I missed class made it harder for me to attempt to get back into the swing of things.

This semester I was put on scholarship probation, I would have to make progress raising my GPA or I lose my scholarship. Even knowing this, I guess I still couldn’t find the willpower to go to class and learn enough of the material. I have just taken two finals I thought I was prepared for, but they destroyed me. I am now expecting to fail those classes, and maybe one more. I will likely lose my scholarship, and I guess have to drop out of college because I can’t pay for it. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what is keeping me from being able to work like a normal person.

I’ve tried to talk to my doctor about depression the Summer before this semester, but we brushed it off after discovering I have an under-active thyroid. After a follow up, I ended up not being completely honest by saying that I felt better after being put on medication for it, even though I didn’t notice any difference in how I felt. 

I really don’t know what to do, I don’t know who to talk to. Do I go to the same doctor to see if we can figure out more relating to my mental health? Do I find a counselor or some other professional that is more suited to figuring out mental health issues? How do I tell my parents that I am probably going to lose my scholarship? They think I’m on track to get B’s this semester (which I was, but my grades plummeted after I got bombarded with assignments and exams).

So I’m 14 and around 6 months ago people in my circle started talking about drugs and how they wanna do them so I joined in (I hate myself for that) and when they decided to try smoke weed for the first time I came along and took one hit. 

Then my friends who live a few cities away from me started smoking and my friends from here heard about it (I’m the only one who gets to see the people who live far away because I take the train to meet them often). Now my friends had started getting more into it and saying that you’re a pussy or you’re lame if you don’t try so I started telling them that I joined in when I was with the other group and vice versa. So they all thought I smoked when really I don’t, I’m scared to. 

My friends at school have started to talk about trying acid recently so naturally I lied my way into the conversation again and this time someone heard and told the school.

153,"I’ve struggled with depression since I (21m) was about 14 years old. Over the last few years, things have gotten a lot better. But, as of August, my life has been just barely short of miserable. I started having attacks where my heart pounds, I get super anxious, and I have these oddly physical symptoms in my head (burning, numbness, sinking feeling) that make me think I’m dying. August and September were the worst, but eventually my medications (Buspar and Prozac) started working and I’ve gone the past month and a half or so with no issues. That was until about 3 nights ago. It started happening again, and it’s just as scary as it was at first. Each night when I try to go to bed, I fear that I’m not going to wake up. Every emergency room visit ends the same. 6 hours of waiting, no significant results from my CT scans, and they load me up on Norco. I hate it.

My question is, is this normal?",11Dec2019,1
154,"
Hi. I was recently diagnosed with anxiety and depression so in a way I’m still learning what all that means and how to pinpoint what these things cause me to feel. 

But for a few years now I’ve had this feeling that something bad is going to happen to interrupt my life regardless of the fact that my future shows no legitimate signs of decline. I just feel like when good things are happening or when I’m close to achieving a goal, something will happen and stop me from enjoying it. 

even when i IMAGINE a good thing happening to me theres like another little voice that comes in with a way to sabotage it or mess it up. 

It might be relevant to note that this is something that I only experience within myself, it does not show in my relationships with others, and I’m the only one who even knows its a thing


What is that if anything? why do I always have that feeling? could it be linked to anything?",11Dec2019,1
155,"Maybe it's simply a case of overactive imagination, but sometimes I just get images of bad things happening. I know it's nothing that has happened, but a lot of times it's really bad. Like seeing my two year old son die in my arms. It happens a lot. And it scares the crap out of me.",11Dec2019,1
156,"So ever since I was 12 I’ve had mood swings, very severe ones. Manic heights and depressive lows. I sort of just thought this was normal, like a quirk of my personality and not entirely a mental illness until I got older and became more aware of my behavior. The highs would last anywhere from 3 hours to 3 days and the lows would sometimes go for as long as a week. I just thought I was depressed? During the highs I was insanely confident, energetic, didn’t need much sleep, got massive amounts of work done, talked incessantly, laughed at inappropriate times, paced rapidly and was generally pretty out of control. I would burst out in class, wouldn’t think about what I said, I would cry hysteric tears, I was a mess and annoying to everyone around me. And the lows were just as severe, suicidal depression, self hatred, no motivation, couldn’t focus. For a period of time in high school I thought it may have been bipolar but the episodes were too short and there were some days where I felt mellow and normal. 

I moved away for college and the highs and lows mellowed out a little, most of the weirdest behaviors mostly stopped, but the episodes are still definitely there. I’m an artist so my quirks were much more accepted by my peers, and I channeled the mania into my artwork. I get massive amounts of work done during my manic episodes, I’m never late on assignments unless I happen to get hit with a really bad depressive mood, and that happens less frequently lately. as for the lows, some days I still hate myself but I’m not suicidal anymore, probably because I’m out of a bad environment. 


Just a couple days ago I snapped into a hypomanic episode. I was up for 30 straight hours, I finished an entire art piece that I had 4 weeks to work on in about 12 hours, it wasn’t due for another several days, I did not need to do this. I was manic, off the walls. And it took me walking out of the studio at 9am and still feeling high to realize that no, no one else I know does this, no one I know has episodes like this, this is not at all normal. 

I knew I wasn’t bipolar, so I was looking stuff up online and I found the term Cyclothymia. I don’t want to self diagnose but it sounded EXACTLY like my experiences and nothing ever has before. Highs and lows, but short ones, often with mellow regular moods in-between. I always just thought I was “weird” but having a term that actually describes my behavior would help me make sense of a lot of what happened when my moods were more out of control a few years ago. 

Honestly I’m fine, I don’t want or feel like I need any treatment, mostly because I’m afraid it would negatively impact my work, the lows are of course shitty but the highs are worth it. I’m not sure if this is destructive thinking or not, but I’m thriving where I’m at right now, my mood swings used to make my life miserable but not anymore. I just want to know if there’s anyone here with a similar experience, or who has even been diagnosed with this? I haven’t heard much about it before.",11Dec2019,1
157,"Being unaware of societal outcasting almost my entire life, caused a lot, all the unawared chaos that’s happened cause me to go down a path of awareness. Now I haven’t felt a clear emotion in over 3 years. Always feeling outside of the average person, I wish I could hop back and forwards. I may be very enlightened by my own intelligence (not that I’m the “high IQ, good at math” type of intelligence, I just think in a very imaginable, creative and unexplainable way because of my autism), I just wish I felt something, my happiness got destroyed and I wrecked my depression, now I’m just an empty shell of willpower, willpower to still move forwards, evolve as a person and get out of bed in the morning.

I really hope I don’t come off wrong, I try to avoid talking about this because I don’t want to be compared to the iamverysmart sub and other ones like it.",11Dec2019,1
158,"I’m really not sure what to do at this point, and I’m worried, so figured I could post here and get some thoughts or just reassurance.

My mom is 44 and her symptoms (afaik) began in her 30s. Not sure what type. She switches meds several times a year because they either have horrible side effects or just don’t improve her quality of life. She recently started a new medication and pretty quickly began having severe chest pains as a side effect. She stopped taking them due to this and now she’s having a mental breakdown which I’ve never seen before as she’s always “shielded me” from the effects of bipolar. We’re best friends, and I’m so worried. We talked on the phone the other night when my stepdad told me what was going on and she was sobbing and saying she can’t do this anymore...never heard her talk like that and tbh she’s usually the one supporting me as I have BPD/PTSD and am going through divorce rn. I’m not ~qualified~ to be telling her what to do, but I’ve gotten a lot of training on how to help someone actively suicidal through the military and through an inpatient trauma program I went to last year, so I’ve been trying to give her bits of advice and reassurance that might help in the present moment. 


Some things I need advice/different perspective on:

- She last saw her psychiatrist in mid-Nov. Apparently psychiatrist knows that she is actively suicidal, but scheduled her next appointment for mid March. What??? To me, that is beyond unacceptable and she needs to be going to therapy at least bi-weekly, if not once a week. She has decent insurance and I have offered to pay for anything she needs as I have a large salary. Is it normal for appointments to be that far spaced out with actively suicidal patients? I don’t know how civilian mental health care works but I’m disappointed and disgusted by the treatment she’s getting. She called them and they said they would let her know if they had a cancellation; she’s thinking about going to the ER tonight which is good. She’s scared of being committed, I think it’d be a good idea to go to a place like the one I went to (it honestly was the best).

- I’ve invited her to move in with me for 6 months while my stepdad is on a business trip. She’s taking care of my dog right now (recently moved several times and wanted him to have some stability for a bit) and I honestly think it’s one of the only things keeping her going. She doesn’t work bc of how severe her bipolar is, and not to baby her, but she doesn’t have a support system where she’s living and I’d like to hopefully change that while being able to keep an eye on her. Good idea? Bad? Am I enabling in any way or potentially setting myself up for a codependent relationship with her? I’m able to fully provide for us and my dog indefinitely, otherwise I wouldn’t offer. I’m scared for her to be alone.

- What kind of resources can I provide my stepdad for learning more about bipolar and how to live with someone who is struggling through it? He’s extremely ignorant to mental illness and is coming off as a complete asshole, calling her selfish and lazy when she can’t do things like go to his work Christmas party. It’s really unacceptable and I’m planning on having a strongly worded convo with him, but would it make sense to get him into a group setting with others or maybe one on one therapy to work through it? He has taken on the role of caregiver at some points.

- Has anyone here successfully filed for disability due to mental illness? She told me she tried a few years ago but got denied. Her inability to work is a serious problem and not a case of lazy, and it makes her feel worse knowing she can’t help out with bills. I know a big piece of this is getting to see a therapist more frequently so everything is documented and consistent. During manic episodes her work attendance gets bad, so it’s a vicious cycle of finding a job, doing great for a few months, manic episode, getting laid off and then unemployment.

- How else can I help from this far away? I’m struggling with BPD and I’ve been isolating a lot since I moved, but I’m now texting and calling once a day to check in with her. It’s one thing when YOU’RE the one who’s actively suicidal, but now that I’m on the other side I really have no idea how to handle it. I didn’t get very much support through it besides my therapist sadly.

She is suffering so much right now and it’s extremely horrifying to hear the things she’s thinking. If I lose my mom, there’s no point in living. She’s the only reason I’m still here. Any advice or assurance here is 10000% appreciated.",11Dec2019,1
159,"Today I went to my first acroyoga class, also called partner yoga, with a girl I've known for a month. It involved trusting myself and complete strangers with my physical well-being. I had to ask a lot of questions and communicate boundaries. It was scary and I was about to not go but it turned out to be an amazing experience.

I used to self-harm and have debilitating panic attacks that seriously disrupted my ability to go to school, have friends or keep a job. It has been ruling and ruining my life for the past 15 years. I failed highschool. I never went to college. I just sat in my room and read.

 My last panic attack was last year and I was close to jumping off my 8th floor balcony (but I didn't). I've had a few anxiety attacks this year but not panic. I've had to make some very hard decisions and cut out family members who are toxic but the journey has been worth it. 

Recovering from bad mental health has often felt like 1 step forward and 2 steps back but today I saw how much progress I've made and I am thrilled.

I hope there's someone out there who can get hope and strength from this. I know I never thought I could be happy, feel loved, have confidence or self-esteem. If I can do it, so can you. Keep fighting the good fight.",11Dec2019,1
160,"This is my very first post on reddit. I'm still really new to the whole community, but I'm at a point where I really need input from people other than my family. This will be a long one, guys.

Two years ago, I decided to leave my ex after about 5 years because I just had enough of feeling manipulated. He had also hit me 1.5 years into our relationship, which created a huge rift in my relationship with my family. I moved back to my hometown with my parents, and I thought I was on the right track. From September to early December 2017, I suffered from the worst depression I've ever had in my life. I was crying every day. I wasn't eating. I didn't want to be alive. I felt completely worthless.

Then John stepped in. I met John back in 2010 when I came home for Christmas break through a mutual hometown friend. We only hung out a few times, but we clicked instantly. Unfortunately, I had to go back to school, so we parted ways. We kept in contact here and there after that, even during my relationship with my ex. When I moved home two years ago, John was hesitant to hang out with me for the first couple of months and I didn't know why. I think he was just struggling with his own mental wellbeing at the time. Finally, we did hang out the first week of December and after that day we couldn't stop talking to each other. We saw each other more and more, and I knew he was falling for me. He always wanted to see me, said he could never stop thinking about me. He confessed that he still thought of me for all those years after we first met. He told me he wanted to make me the happiest person I could be, that he wants to do things with me, he wants to give me everything and more. I started falling for him too. He came in when I was feeling so low and picked me up.

I knew from the beginning that he did have his own mental struggles. There was one night in January right after we started seeing each other that I went out, got drunk, and didn't message him for hours. He was calling me and messaging me trying to reach me, and when I finally talked to him on the phone, he told me he cut himself. It was so upsetting, but we got through it. After that, he had a few outbursts of anger that I didn't understand at the time. He would always apologize afterward and I could tell he felt ashamed. 

Around June of 2018, he kind of just moved in with me at my parents' house. He didn't have a job (he doesn't have his license either), but he had money saved up from his job when he lived at home. He'd usually spend time with my mom during part of the day, go over to our local supermarket sometimes to pick up food, and then we'd spend our time together when I got home from work. He genuinely seemed pretty happy, excited to be with me, and we were overall doing well. 

Finally, we decided it was time for him to find a part-time job. He was running out of money, and he wanted to be able to provide for me. That's when things started to get worse. I think the idea of getting a new job caused a lot of stress for him, and he began to lash out. One day, I said something random that just triggered him. He went up to our room in the attic and just started throwing things, having a fit. I came up and tried to touch him to comfort him. He pushed me away and told me to stay away from him. His place to go to when he wants to be alone is the computer room on our second floor. I messaged him, and he said ""fuck you"" and just ignored me for a bit. Eventually, he calmed down and we got through it. 

Then one day while he was at work, he got overwhelmed and punched the wall there. He finished out his shift, came home, and went right to the computer room. He started out just saying how he wants to disappear, how he just feels sick of it all. Then he just got angrier and angrier and started saying the most horrible things to me... ""fuck you, you cunt"" ""why don't you just go and cut yourself again"" ""I watch porn every night because I can't stand to have sex with you anymore"". Just the worst possible things he could say. I decided to ignore him because it was making me so upset. He ended up cutting his arm up in the bathroom and sent me a picture. I didn't know what to do, so I finally went to my mom. We tried to get him to come downstairs and talk, but he just stayed up in the computer room. My parents were alarmed, of course, but they gave him another chance. 

A few weeks later (so June 2019 sometime), he ended up walking out of his job because he had another outburst. Since then, he's just seemed so bitter and irritable. His outbursts are much more frequent, and sometimes the most insignificant things will set him off. He can't even go to the supermarket anymore because he's had episodes there too. He barely comes out of our room in the attic. He can't face my parents anymore. We don't visit his family. He's become so reclusive. I just don't know what to do. 

I recently had a mental breakdown because of all this. I'm going to see a psychiatrist, and I'm on a new medication. My parents are so concerned for me (and for him) and they just want to see me happy. I'm so grateful that they have allowed him to live here because I know most people would not put up with this. They are my biggest support system.

I'm sure anyone who reads this will think I'm nuts for staying with this man. But I love him. I fell in love with him, and he really is a wonderful person underneath all these mental problems. When he's feeling okay, he's great and I feel like I have hope. But I'm living in constant anxiety that he will have an outburst. I'm always wondering when the next one will occur and how bad it will be. We never really go out anymore because his social anxiety is through the roof. He can't work because he's just not in the right place mentally. He just sits at home all day until I come home from work. 

I set up an appointment for him to have a psychiatric evaluation in January. He has admitted to me that he needs help, and he wants to get better. We both can't live like this. His family never took him to get any help when he was younger, and he's suffered from anxiety, depression, and anger since he was a pre-teen. His parents fought constantly and abused him a few times when he was a kid. They don't understand his problems and they just lash back out at him. 

I did my own research, and I think he suffers from intermittent explosive disorder, social anxiety disorder, and right now I believe he's in an episode of severe depression. I know losing his job took a toll on him, but his outbursts and locking himself away from everyone is making it so difficult for me every day. 

Does anyone else have experience with this? What advice do you have for me? I don't know what the right thing is to do. I desperately want to help him, but I need to help myself too. I don't want to give up on him or our relationship. I really do believe he truly loves me, and I miss that passion he had in the first year. I just don't know what to do.",11Dec2019,1

I don't know if this is the right sub but I just need to tell someone how I feel. Most of the time I'm a happy guy who just hides his true feelings. I'm not the best with emotion I don't even know what I'm feeling half the time unless it's happy or sad. Also I'm useless if anyone around me if feeling sad because I just don't know what to do. I'm shit at emotions basically.

I'm currently just not motivated to do anything, I'm 4 assignments behind in college but still can't find anything in me that wants to do them even though if I don't I'm gonna be kicked out the college. There's nothing that can motivate me to do them.

I have no idea what I want to do and put on a fake smile all the time. The only time I'm actually happy is when I've lost myself watching videos or movies not having to face anything in the real word.

162,"Hello, I've been suffering from mental health issues for a few years now since moving from a different country to the United States. Specifically, Oregon Eugene (I am going to expose where I live so maybe people could help me find one).

I don't want to self-diagnose myself or jump into conclusions but I feel like something is definitely wrong with me. I'm also only a teenager at highschool so it's probably my hormones doing hormone-things? I don't know. All I know is that I feel worthless and like nothing matters, and I feel suicidal more than I should be feeling (that's an overstatement but I don't really want to sound like I'm whining).

I'm looking for help here instead of talking to my parents because they don't understand me. When they found out about my self-harm tendencies, they took me to a student in training therapist at a near by university once. All she did was ask ""why?"" to everything I said and I don't feel like I've gained anything from that experience. After that, we never went back because my parents decided that I'm all fine and happy now.

My mom would come in my room, grab my arm then pull up my sleeves to check for any new cuts. She once yelled at me in public because she found new scars on my arms. She also says that what I'm feeling is all in my head and I just need to deal with it. 

And dad is pretty much the same; he thinks I'm just making excuses to be lazy and not do my homework.

I'm already a burden to my parents so asking for more wouldn't work.

My boyfriend and his family offered help me find a therapist without me having to tell my parents about it since they aren't being helpful at all
(they said they will be willing to pay since they're pretty comfortable, also apparently insurances cover most of it? I'm not really sure)

My friend is telling me that letting my highschool boyfriend find a therapist for me is irresponsible and not the way to go, but my boyfriend's family has gone through stuff themselves and they know better about this than I do. I trust them.

And for those of you who will tell me to just talk to my school counselor: I already have tried. I go to a religious school and all the advice they gave me was related to God. As an atheist, not very helpful.

163,"

I don't know if this is the right forum for this but I need to get my thoughts out somewhere. Lately, I have been struggling with my mental health. I feel like I exist in three states most of the time. 

1)Angry about something that happened in the past that shouldn't even bother me, which then leads me to be annoyed/angry at myself for letting it bother me.  

2) Sad and depressed for no reason which leads me to be sad and depressed about being sad and depressed 

3) Anxious about nothing, a constant fear that I carry around. Which I am 90 percent sure is the cause of all my stomach issues. I constantly feel pressure in my stomach and chest and then get major anxiety about my breathing or that my chest is filling up with gas and force myself to burp. It's exhausting which I feel also compounds all of these problems. 

I keep up a good image. I am a top performer at work, I am in pretty good shape and gym regularly, I have a GF and lots of friends that I see often. On the inside though, I am a wreck. If I am not 100 percent occupied with something mentally these negative thoughts consume me. It doesn't help that my father suffered from depression and I have seen him try and commit suicide multiple times which ups the anxiety and anger I feel because I feel like it's out of my control. 

I'm tired of being angry for no reason, I'm tired of being sad for no reason, I'm tired of being anxious all the time. I feel bad for the people close to me because they sometimes can see the negativity and sometimes I even take some out on them.

172,"Why Am I So Addicted To Social Media?

We wake in the morning to check what has happened in the world. Throughout the day we will see everything our friends and families have posted. We check local events, news, sports and politics. We will do again before we sleep and the following day, we will repeat it all again.

Social media for some has become as important as food, water and shelter. The idea of losing it would be the same as losing a limb. To lose a sense of purpose and meaning to the world around us.

So how has something nearly non-existent ten years ago, have such an impact on our everyday lives?

As humans, one of our core principles is self-worth. The need to be wanted. We need connections with others to survive. It has been documented in the older generation, the impacts of loneliness. It is one of the biggest killers. We go through life mastering human interaction and spend time and resources maintaining these relationships with others. It is costly but rewarding. Our rewards not only come in the way of security, a sense of purpose but also in the form of Dopamine and Serotonin. This is our bodies way of saying it’s all worth it. It feels good. So, we keep investing time with others.

Then social media came along and changed everything!

Why only have a small amount of relationships maintained, when you can have hundreds or even thousands of people giving you self-worth at a fraction of the resources and time spent before.  
Every post, every picture, every comment, liked, feeding your Dopamine and Serotonin addiction. Reinforcing your self-esteem, giving purpose to your place in the world.

So, where’s the problem?

Is there a problem?

For some people no. Social media is a tool used to enhance the relationship already built upon over the course of your life. It’s difficult to see everyone and if used correctly can keep these relationships from windling away.  The problem comes when Social media relationships, replaces your actual interactions and relationships.

An example of this is being in a crowded room full of friends and family, but still more concerned about posting and monitoring what others are saying about the time that you are spending with said friends and family.

Nearly all of us can be guilty about this. We post when we go out, we post pictures of our food, how our day went, the holidays we go on, if we disagree with someone, pretty much everything. We want re assurance in others and to feel special. The more we use the more addictive it becomes and the more we can not live without it.

It is a drug.

Probably now the most used drug in the world. Billions of people using it several times a day. Not even all the drug users, alcoholics, gamblers, smokers combined can match the use rate and numbers of people involved in Social Media.

But surely it can’t be labelled as the same. Then ask yourself one question –

Could I give up all social media?

Facebook, twitter, snapchat, Instagram to name a few. Could I turn them all off tomorrow and be happy? Probably not. Studies have shown that people are more likely to give up a drink or a smoke, to check for updates on a social media site.

If globally known addictive substances, condemned for the impacts they can cause on health and the community are reported less addictive than Social Media then where does this leave us?

I believe the true impact of Social Media upon the mental health of the population has yet to be fully witnessed. Already we are seeing self-esteem, self-worth issues as well as body dysmorphia, depression and anxiety from over usage of Social Media and many other mental health issues. The biggest problem will be when the younger generation growing up knows, no other way of interacting with others, than that of a world dominated with social media.

The effects of social media on mental health in children is coming discussed in an upcoming post.

It sucks that life decides to strike you down twice and they leave with no wounds.",11Dec2019,1
174,"Don’t judge 

I was pissed drunk (I think it’s starting to become a habit) but that’s not the point. I felt like shit at the end of it but then I saw my arm and saw a really small scar around the area I’ve been practising to cut. It’s really small but I’ve never been good with pain. And so when I saw it my mood majorly improved. I’m not really sure if this is just me being a bitch because my family don’t help me with these issues so I don’t know 🤷🏾‍♂️",11Dec2019,1
175,"A year ago, life could not have been better. I was losing weight, my anxiety, depression, and OCD was under control, and I was planning a wedding proposal, early stages to be sure, but something I had thought about doing since I was in middle school. 

What ended up playing out was far different. And it really got me thinking today about how a year ago, I was so confident about who and where I was only to have that reality flipped without warning. 2019 has been by far one of the most challenging years of my life but if it’s to mean anything, if all the struggle and despair is to have any value, I have to take that pain and craft it into something new, something different. 

So to that end, those of you fellow humans that have also had a bad year, what do you hope to see come in 2020 and how will you use the lessons of 2019 to inform the next?",11Dec2019,1
176,"I don't know what's wrong with me. I try really hard to be funny all the time. People tell me I'm 'dry' but I sort of hate it when people laugh at my jokes. I used to love it when i made people laugh at anything I said, but in recent years I've weirdly come to resent it.

I feel like that they are just laughing along for the sake of it or that the thing I said wasn't particularly funny and probably wasn't worthy of laughter in the first place. If it's clear that someone genuinely thought what I said was funny then it kinda makes me lose a little respect for them. 

What's wrong with me?",11Dec2019,1
