0,"Hey guys
I’m a senior in undergrad and I’ve been pre-med since entering college. I’ve had a really rough year last year (two psychiatric hospitalizations and one serious suicide attempt). After some soul-searching, I decided that I still wanted to become a doctor. I’m scheduled to take the MCAT in August and I’m wondering if this is the right choice. On one hand, I think I’m making great progress with studying and I now have a clearer picture of what type of doctor I want to be and how to get there. On another hand, I’m afraid that as I get closer to the test date, the pressure to do well will eventually break me and undo the progress I made thus far with my mental health. I’m also not sure if postponing the test date would do me any good. I’ve heard different things from different people (pre-health advisors, psychiatrist, friends, etc.) about whether I should still aim for that test date. If anyone here is a fellow pre-med or a medical student, would you mind offering some advice or sharing your experiences with how you dealt with this type of situation? Thanks in advance!",25Apr2019,1
1,"Hello! I'm rather new to this sub but saw a lot of support and wanted to pose a question.   
I'm a graduate student (online, not on campus) and do not work due to the course load. I've been experiencing some depressive symptoms and outlandish anger, but without health insurance am unable to afford therapy. Does any know if there is an affordable way to get mental health care without going broke or getting marketplace insurance?",25Apr2019,5
2,"If anyone reads this, thank you. Lately I’ve been feeling down over a girl that I really liked.


She was incredibly friendly/nice when I first met her and she stole my heart. However, she stopped she doesn’t reach out like she used to and stopped messaging me. This is pretty difficult for me to see her come into my life and just leave. Especially in the middle of a deep depression. I’m pretty resistant to relationships and always have been but this is the first time I’ve fallen in love. I have been incredibly depressed and can’t get her out of my head. It’s difficult to accept that I probably mean nothing to her and she means the world to me. I don’t want to reach out and seem desperate. It seems like I just don’t mean that much to her at all. Any advice to get over her? I probably wouldn’t have been able to keep the relationship anyways due my anxiety and depression.",25Apr2019,6
3,"Every day I do something stupid that makes me feel worse. But the stupid shit I do I feel is a result of how I feel. Whether it’s my inability to remember anything, not caring, or not being able to focus. Most of it has to do with school though. Like bombing a test, not remembering my homework, or not remembering how to do anything. I get a shit grade on a test, I sart to feel worse about myself, then I don’t have the strength to work as hard. It’s like some fucked up exponential decay. My teachers have high expectations of me and it feels so bad that I’m letting them down now.

I’ve been falling through this downward spiral for the entire year and I hate it. I hate myself for being so damn stupid. 

Please, how do I stop doing this to myself?",25Apr2019,10
4,"I’ve (23f) been living with depression and suicidal thoughts for about 8 years now. I’ve recently (the last 4 months or so) stopped taking all my medication, but I’ve been doing pretty good. I noticed when I’m alone and I’m neither happy nor sad, I automatically revert back to my old way of thinking and almost force myself to be sad and have bad thoughts. Maybe it’s because I’m so used to it and comfortable with those thoughts? It feels like I can’t be happy unless I have a real reason when I’m alone. I was just wondering if anyone else has had this same experience...",25Apr2019,2
5,"I'm aware of the illogical nature of my thoughts. I know that anxiety and paranoia are behind them. What does that mean exactly? Like, what if I was criminally insane and knew it. Doesn't that mean I could control my thoughts and actions?",25Apr2019,8
6,"This question might've been asked before but here it goes again. I can't feel sadness, I don't know when is the last time I felt sad. My fav uncle died last year, I had such great memories with him, the fact that I won't see him ever again didn't bring tears to my eyes even a bit. Is it because I've convinced my self that death is a part of life and that crying won't change the past? What's done is done. My mom was in tears, I wish I could sympathize with her, I had no idea how to calm her.

A friend of mine shares her depression thoughts with me, still I fail to sympathize with her. I could tell her that my sympathies for her are just my learned response, but I don't want to hurt her, she says I am the only guy that understands her, and honestly I don't know.

I've stopped watching movies long ago (6yrs+) because they bore me. I hate romance and emotional movies, they all seem pointless. While my friends watch and cry, I just sit there in silence.

I was a bit hesitant to ask because it may sound edgy, and maybe get hates, but again insults don't work on me anymore, I am used to it.

EDIT: I forgot to mention, I am just a normal 18yo guy who plays video games all day, and watch animes.",25Apr2019,3
7,"I am disgusted by the way i look, i'm so fucking fat and gross, i'm so disgusted by the amount of food i eat. I gained so much weight in just a few months, its so unhealthy. I cant even look at my body anymore. I cant wear shorts or short sleeve shirts around people and summer is coming. I don't know what i'm gonna do. Fuckk i hate myself so much.",25Apr2019,1
8,"I feel so alone, even though I'm not. I don't live by myself, I have excellent friends, I see my co-workers regularly. Yet, I find myself craving companionship while also avoiding it. It's a shit feeling knowing you feel alienated because you're alienating yourself.

I also crave affection. I want love. Someone who loves me for who I am and not what I have, because I don't have much. I just want that one special girl who always makes my day better no matter how shitty it is/was. But I'm so insecure about my mental health, my financial problems, and the fact that I'm 28 and only working part time that it gets to me and ruins any attempts I could have at a relationship. I find that I'm constantly swiping through dating apps, and have some decent matches on all of them, but I don't know what to say. I have no confidence anymore.",25Apr2019,1
9,"Just for background, I’m quite sure I suffer from, childhood trauma? When I was a kid my mom would beat me with this wooden stick, she never hit me in the face though so that’s nice and this one time when I was 7 she got super mad and threatened to cut my tongue out off my mouth with a turkey cutter, I was out of the cords length though so that’s good.

Anywho 
Please, can anyone here give me advice? I feel like I’m super insecure. I really want to change this, and, I’ll get random bouts of self induced isolation/alienation when I’m not feeling okay, and I get eaten alive by this because I have super low self confidence/esteem, or correct me if I’m wrong, and I hate myself too, And I’ll get these really bad panic attacks where I’ll think dying would be a practical solution, (just to add those thoughts are never acted upon, so I haven’t got to the point yet where I’m actively making plans for suicide). I’ll usually get wound about something super existential  been actively trying to reverse these habits, please, any advice is good advice. Thank you",25Apr2019,1

11,"Mental illness is prevalent in my family. So, it's likely that any children I have would inherit that from me. I hold a lot of resentment against my mom for going on and having kids without any concern of what she was passing on. If I have a child they could feel the same way about me and be completely right. I want to raise a child and be a good parent and do everything I wish my parents did, but I wouldn't wish the way I feel on anyone let alone my own child. If I can get to the point in my life where adopting a child is possible, I would want to because it honestly feels immoral to give someone life when it could be such a burden. I'm young at the moment, a junior in high school.",25Apr2019,0
13,"Sorry for formatting - on mobile. Also, sorry for how long and rambling this is going to be. 

I (24F) am considering seeking professional help for the first time in my life. Ever since I can remember I've been extremely emotional and generally sad. I'll have really, really good weeks where I'm the queen and think I'm the best there is, followed by unbelievable lows where I can't get out of bed and I seriously consider suicide. When I was younger all of this was associated (both by my parents and myself) as just being a dramatic teenager. But I'm in my 20s now and other than noticing there's a cycle and being aware of it, I've seen zero improvement in the intensity of these swings. 

I have a good life now. I'm with a great guy, we live together, we have a dog, we're not struggling to survive or anything like that. Even still, most days I'll consider driving my car off a bridge or swallowing a bunch of pills. I'm tired of playing guessing games as to whether it's a good or bad day. I just want to enjoy the life I'm building.

So, I'm going to get help, but I'm scared. I'm scared of a million different things when it comes to taking this step ranging from being laughed at to being sent to a mental hospital and having ""is suicidal"" on my permanent medical record. I'm also not sure how I feel about actual medications after seeing the exhausting trial-and-error process my family members have gone through for being treated for anxiety/depression/etc. 

So, what should I expect? Where do I start? What can I reveal and not reveal when I'm talking to these people? To medicate, or not to medicate? It all seems so overwhelming.",25Apr2019,1

20,"I was starting to get into such a good place mentally until the beginning of this month when I lost my dog. Like, he was my best friend, and some days was the only reason I got out of bed in the morning. I still don't know what I'm supposed to do without him. Like, I've struggled so much in the past with anxiety and depression and suicidal thoughts, and he was just sort of always there to curl up in bed with me or lick my face or try to get me to play with him. I can't tell you how many times I was seriously planning to end it all when he looked up at me with those big brown eyes and I suddenly realized how much he loved me and needed me around. I haven't had any proper suicidal thoughts in about four months, but now I'm terrified that they're gonna come back and I'm not going to have anything here to stop it. People keep telling me that I should just get a new dog, but I don't think they understand just how much he meant to me. Like, how could I just replace my best friend like that?",25Apr2019,1
21,"Sounds like depression, right? I know I probably have a mood disorder of some kind. Mild bipolar or depression, I've been diagnosed with both at various times. The thing is, I feel this way even when I feel good. I feel this way even when I take antidepressants. I just kinda hate being the person that I am, and I can't really be anybody else.

Most of it revolves around women. I'm a man. I'm 35 now. I have had some brief relationships, the longest being 7 months. My last was about two years ago. I have had a few drunk hookups. I'm officially not an incel by that standard, but I find it very difficult to find anyone who's at all interested in me sexually or romantically.

I don't blame anybody for that. I don't entirely understand it, but I assume that it's just that I'm not very appealing, overall. I'm not particularly ugly. I don't have much money, but I keep a roof over my head. I'm not an asshole to people. I do have some social anxiety, but it doesn't prevent me from being able to talk to people. I'm generally an okay conversationalist, I think. I'm not 100% sure what it is; I assume it's a sort of intersection of just not being very appealing in a variety of ways. The reason doesn't really matter in the end.

I use dating apps, quite a bit. I do not get many matches, it goes without saying. I go out on some dates. This all seems very normal, I suppose. What an ordinary man I seem to be. Nobody wants to go out with me more than once, though. Twice, every once in a while. It's not completely clear why, and of course nobody will just tell you. On a few occasions, people have said they don't feel a spark, or a connection. I feel a spark; I feel a connection. They don't. If there's a way to figure out why, I don't know what it is.

I have friends, but I'm still very lonely, and I feel hopeless much of the time. Sure, maybe that's depression. But rationally I don't think I have much reason to feel hopeful. I have difficulty just assuming my life will change. It's kinda always been like this. I try not to obsess about it. I try to just focus on the things that I can control and take one day at a time. I've got plenty of coping mechanisms, I guess.

Anyway, something happened today that often happens to me, and I was wondering if anybody could provide any insight into what this is called or how one might go about dealing with it.

I was at the gym, and I walked by a woman that I found attractive, and our eyes met before we both glanced away. And I knew that the last thing she wanted to do was talk to me, or hear that I thought she was beautiful. She's just trying to work out, not deal with some guy she doesn't find attractive being creepy. I just don't have anything to offer her. I don't have any value to her. And I was intensely aware of the fact that the best thing I could do for this woman was just be unobtrusive, just be another face in the crowd. Just be invisible. I felt ashamed to exist, and to have these absurd, unrealistic desires. I wanted, more than anything, to just not exist. To not be this person.

I was in a good mood before I went to the gym, and I was in a good mood afterward. I just kind of put it aside. Like I said, I'm pretty good at coping. But I would like not to feel this way so often, and I don't know how.

I anticipate that someone is going to tell me that this is negative self talk. I hear that. I shouldn't tell myself that I'm not valuable. The thing is, something valuable is something that is valued. I am objectively not valued by women. They don't want me. That's just a fact. I can try not to think about it, but I can't seem to pretend it's not true in a way that sticks.

Sorry for the length. I find it hard to express this concisely.",25Apr2019,0
22,"No matter how many clothes I buy, how much I exercise, what I do to my hair, or how much I distract myself on the internet, depression will always be there. Eating me up inside. 

Sometimes something happens in your life that changes your perspective forever, and no matter what you can't go back to the way it was before. Something inside me broke, and it'll never be fixed again.

""Get some sunlight""
""Believe in religion""

26,"Hi all, I am hoping for some advice. 

I have been very lonely all my life. When I was a kid I used to imagine people in the room with me. I’d imagine people talking to me and just being nice to me. To this day I pretty much always have the TV on to feel like there are others near me. Even when I am with others and talking to them I feel disconnected, like they don’t understand me and I don’t understand them. 

To cope with this I’ve fixated on fandom since early teenagerhood. Always only one fandom at a time because it seems like I’m only capable of liking one thing at a time. My current coping mechanism fandom has died and I’m feeling very anxious and untethered, like I don’t know what to do with myself. Honestly my feelings are similar to grief. I don’t have anything else I want to do; any other hobbies I used to have no longer interest me. The fandom made me feel connected to others and now I feel alone again. 

I’m just wondering if anyone has any tips on dealing with this kind of hyperfixation as a means of coping. Because right now I’m not coping at all and I feel so foolish for caring so much about a silly piece of media that its loss is affecting me so greatly.",25Apr2019,7
27,"hello, this my fist post here tho i been part of this sub for a while now.

So yesterday(April 23) was my 20th birthday, now i don't really care about it much but i still anticipate a call from my father, which i rearly get and when i do i get days after and is because his wife reminds him to. Now i wouldnt mind if he just forgot because of how much of a sh\*thead he is, but it pisses me off that of all 5 of us(2 older half brothers, one sister which i live with since she is my only full sibling and a yonger half brother) I am the only one he keeps ignoring, he never forgets my sisters birthday since she's his favorite(which he loves to let ME know) nor my brothers birthdays but not mine, he just gave up on me, like i always knew i was his least favorite(as in he always treated me like a stranger) but he atleast pretended to care, but now whenever he calls my sister he doesnt even say hi to me. last Christmas he spent an hour facetiming to my sister in the other room only for me to find out after he hang up, nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

I seriously always hated it because I have no idea why, with my mother i know why she always abused me as a child(she blamed me for all her problems expecially her failed realationship with him, which failed becaused she was his mistress) but not him, he doesnt hate me(i think) he just doesnt like me, like im just a stranger to him. he lives in another state but when he visits i never find out until he drops my sister off, it just bothers me so f\*cking much, what did i do wrong, be born? how is that my fault, what about her, whats so special about her? apperantly everything since everyone wont shut the f\*ck up about how great she is and how i should be more like her, shes not great, shes a selfish bully, a terrible person who hides her actions behind god(just like him)

36,"Hi, 

I don’t know how to express how I’m feeling at this very moment, as too many emotions are running through my head. I’m feeling hopeless, worthless, embarrassed, depressed, lost and so much more. I had an exam today, which I got caught cheating in. This would be considered my second offence, as I’ve been in this situation before. The first time had been for a different reason, but I can’t believe that I let this happen for a second time. I am very disappointed in myself and feel completely worthless. For this exam, I studied quite a bit and spent countless nights without sleep. I tried to practice as much as I could by doing countless past finals multiple times. But for some reason, my mind just doesn’t seem to process information. I have books and books that i filled up with all of the problems that I solved, so I want to say that i did try. 

Anxiety is something that I’ve been experiencing for quite some time. However, it’s something that I’ve been dealing with on my own. Lately it’s gotten a lot worse to the point where my chest has been causing me a lot of pain and my upper body feels paralyzed as well. Even though I did prepare for this exam, my anxiety took over. I’ve been stuck in a constant state of panic mode and my body physically and mentally cannot take it anymore. I am finally seeking help and taking matters into my own hands to prevent things like this from occurring again. I honestly can’t live another day like this and need to figure out a way to mange my anxiety. I feel like my anxiety is affecting my memory because I can’t seem to retain much even though I study quite a bit. Moving forward, I’m defiantly going to make changes because I don’t want to be this person anymore. I want to be someone who does things with integrity. 

This situation is no longer in my control and I will have to live with the consequences. I can get suspended from school or face expulsion. I don’t know what I would do with my life in the event that I do get expelled. There’s a process that I have to go through, which involves a hearing with 5 panel members that decide on the sanction. I don’t know what I would do if expulsion is the case... 

I really did mess up and feel like I deserve this. I believe in karma and I can see the effect of it taking place in this situation. I want to better myself, but I just wish I had one more chance to come back from this nightmare. I don’t think I’ll have peace of mind until I know what’s going to happen, but I just want to put it out there that I’m really sorry that this happened. There’s just so much more I’m feeling, but can’t put into words.... 

Is there a way for me to recover this? I hope expulsion is not the case because I would still like to proceed with my studies and do it the right way this time. I would really like a second chance to redeem myself...

37,"The last week or so I’ve been increasingly disconnected from myself. And it’s really hard to explain whats going on. Because the logical part of my brain is reminding me that all these thoughts are crazy, but that doesn’t make them feel any less real.


But all of my memories feel like lies. It feels like I’ve been watching memories in a reel in my mind for the last week, things I haven’t thought about in years, and that I’m about to wake up 15 years ago with all of this knowledge of the future. That I’m just having one really long dream about what’s to come and none of this is real. Every memory I have feels like a lie, even if I know that it happened. 


I think about my job and all the people I work with and I know I’ve seen these people 5 days a week, 52 weeks a year, but it feels like I’ve imagined that all. That they don’t exist, or at the very least are part of an elaborate plan to make me think they’re real. In my head it’s kind of like a slightly warped version of the Truman show phenomenon. Somehow the thoughts that everyone hates me and are out to get me are ramping up in what is like some sort of fucky contradictory thought loops. Paranoia is increasing.


And I know this is crazy. At the minute I can convince myself that it is crazy and ridiculous and insane. And I can still differentiate what I’m feeling and what my little smidge of rational thought is telling me is nuts. But I don’t know what’s happening and what happens when I can no longer distinguish between these thoughts and reality? I just don’t know what’s happening.",25Apr2019,3
38,"I'm 37 and have been taking different anti depressants since I was 18. Started with Paxil, moved to Wellbutrion, Effexor, Zoloft, etc. My last one was Trintillex for the past 6 years. My insurance won't pay for that one anymore and it was going to cost upwards of $300/mo. I talked to my doctor about stopping all together ( I feel that my life itself has no reason to cause me to be depressed so want to try life without it). We weened myself off over the coarse of 5 - 6 weeks. 

Since then, I have had a kaleidoscope of withdrawal effects. Massive muscle tension, insomnia, euphoria and my current mindset is restless/blah. I'm not suicidal but it's almost like the rose colored glasses came off and I'm having a ""fuck so this is life and I have to life like this for the next 40 years or so"" and then that makes me spiral and just feel everything is pointless. 

Any thoughts on this? I know after 20 years on meds, I doubt the medication is just going to disappear from my body in a matter of weeks but curious if this is it or is there more to come (hopefully for the better).",25Apr2019,7
39,"I relapsed just a few minutes ago, and I don’t know what to do now. I used to have a pretty severe addiction to cutting myself and I am so emotionally numb right now that I needed to feel something and I did it. I’ve been clean for about two years and now I’m back to square one. I would have done more damage, but the friend that I had been begging to talk to because I needed to get out of that mindset called me. I didn’t have the courage to tell him how I really am feeling right now and how my life is good, but I’m slowly breaking down mentally. What should I do? I feel like a complete failure...

41,"I finally managed to tell my mom that I want to switch to an online therapist. She said that it was expensive and that I don’t know that therapy is working. I dread going to the therapy sessions. My mom believes I don’t feel anything that I don’t tell her about. Her response is always “But you haven’t felt like that before”. Of course I have, but I just can’t talk about it. I told her that I wanted to switch because I can’t talk honestly in person. I realize I probably made them think I was suicidal, but I was talking about the symptoms. I don’t know why, but I find it impossible to talk about my more severe symptoms. Mostly about how dissociated I feel. This feeling has become an almost 24/7 experience. It is the worst feeling that I’ve ever known. It literally feels like I don’t exist, but I’m just dragging this body around with me. I haven’t mentioned anything about how I feel like everyone is just waiting to betray me either. Or how I can’t stop fidgeting, how I’m always on the verge of crying at school and how the same teacher that noticed my anxiety literally told me I was “playing” in class when I had an anxiety attack. I’ve been one of his clients for at least 2  1/2 months. Not really that long, but it just feels so pathetic.

The past few weeks, I’ve had at max 6 hours of sleep, usually 4 or 3 hours. I’ve been having a harder time concentrating on anything. Everything is kinda blurry, and I don’t need to eat food, or sleep. All I have needed has been water. Since I told my mom, I’ve had the worst stress headaches I’ve ever experienced, and when I get stressed my stomach is growling, like I’m hungry even after I’ve eaten. It seems stress related. It usually lasts for half an hour of my stomach growling with small spaces between the growls.

When I decided to tell my mom about what I thought of therapy it was at the beginning of our testing weeks. Which meant that I literally couldn’t answer the question accurately. The most I can get will probably be a 250-300, out of 600 points. I did better on today’s test, but got even more stressed after the test wouldn’t load for 15+ minutes, and I’ve always been the slowest to finish. Today I had a therapist session. My mom came in with me. Whenever someone asked me a question, I didn’t say anything. During the whole session, all I could do was nod and shake my head and shrug. 

Among all that has been happening, tomorrow I have to do a project, but it isn’t a normal project. It’s my band project. My friend decided that she was going to play her clarinet at her sister’s kindergarten. She invited me to join, and I felt obligated since she would change her project if I didn’t join. I’m gonna do two projects, a composition and playing at a kindergarten. Tomorrow is the performance, and I just got the piece of music I need to play yesterday. Tomorrow I am gonna be performing a duet that I learned in 3 hours, this includes tomorrow’s practice time. It might seem like enough time, but at my level, I sincerely doubt that I’ll be playing it at a high level. 

This is getting long, but tomorrow I also have to go through a physical examination. My mom is going to ask about prescribing medication for my anxiety. I don’t think it will be strong enough since the only symptoms I have revealed have been mild, and only add up to mild GAD. They told me that after the medication starts working, I will work on practicing techniques. I hate techniques for some reason. It sounds absolutely terrible to me. I like the prospect of being on medication, but I fear it will be too weak.

Basically my whole week has been trash, and I’ve had the worst symptoms of anxiety that I’ve ever had in the last few weeks.

Great.

42,"It's good to note I have Bipolar and OCD and a history of psychosis, so those factors could play into my dreams.


All my life, I've had persistently morbid dreams. Starting at a young age, I had night terrors, nightmares, betwetting issues, and I didnt stop having to take comfort in my parents' bed until I was 11. I wasnt even allowed to watch horror movies as a child because I was too disturbed and it caused so many issues. My dreams were so chronic all my childhood friends remember it being an issue for me at slumber parties or otherwise. Parents hated having me invited to sleepovers sometimes because theyd have to deal with my nightmares. Mind you, I have 0 childhood trauma. I wasnt abused, I wasnt molested, I never saw anything traumatic. My childhood was normal as hell.

As I got older and exposed to more things, my dreams became significantly worse. I swear to God they can be some of the most disturbing things on earth. I've woken up gagging like I was going to vomit, I've woken up with tears in my eyes, I've woken up with images in my mind I could never erase (as if I actually saw them and was actually traumatized). I've seen such horrific things just in my dreams that I know I can never forget. 

Every night I have dreams with a disturbing aspect, but they dont particularly disorder my life anymore. I'd say, 29/30 mornings I wake up and remember these dreams but feel virtually nothing anymore. I'm so used to these horrific dreams they do not horrify me, and I even find myself remembering them and laughing because I've developed a dark sense of humor. Sometimes my dreams scare me only when I ponder the memory because i'm frightened of myself for the fact my own mind conceived that. As a persistent vivid dreamer, I am also good at lucid dreaming sometimes and I've actually changes the direction of nightmares before. Dreams are literally like a part of my life to the point I think about it like I think about what i'll eat tomorrow.


The thing that bothers me the most is what my mind can conceive because there are some seriously horrible things I've watched and done in my dreams that caused me virtually no emotion or that I even took joy in experiencing when i know, 8 years ago, i would have been horrified. And most people would be.

Lastly, my nightmares simply arent typical. When i read about nightmares most people have and when people express their nightmares, they're nothing like mine. I dont say that to be different or something but rather to acknowledge there is something atypical about my dream patterns and dream themes that I really wish I could understand.",25Apr2019,2

44,"DISCLAIMER: The person described isn't the OP but is more of a case study.

Just wondering, feeling thoughtful. If there's a child that is exposed to an unpredictable environment, where one parent leaves, and the other is sometimes nurturing and available and sometimes cold and unavailable, maybe that child will develop a default demeanor of unaffectedness and apathy, as a way of not relying on others, not letting people get close, and not being vulnerable to others hurting them. And in this process, because its hard to be selective about apathy, they block out their own level of care for themselves. I wonder how this could be resolved in adulthood.

47,"Okay, I'm 21 now and was struggling with OCD resembling symptoms from when I was 12 up until a couple of months ago. The reason I say they are OCD resembling and not OCD is because I've never been officially diagnosed. I believe my symptoms feel like OCD and look like OCD (my obsessions consisted of numbers and somewhat religious themes) but in truth I'm not really sure they were genuine anymore. 

Largely due to these behaviors, I daresay I've hit rock bottom. Largely because of these OCD symptoms, I've struggled in my university classes and wasted a crapload of money. I was planning on going to med school, had the grades for it and everything, but that's not gonna happen now. I've disappointed my parents and let myself descend into a person that I never imagined I could be. In response,  a couple of months ago I stopped all forms of obsessive behavior. I guess I just got tired of it all. The problem, should it have been this easy? It was so easy that I'm beginning to question whether I had OCD in the first place. 

My doubt stems from 2 places:

 1.) I didn't really have a ton of symptoms until after I learned about what OCD was. Although, a potential point against this is that there was one symptom when I was younger than 12 and before I learned about OCD. To be more specific, if I turn around 360 degrees, I would counter it by turning the opposite direction. So if I spun around 360 degrees clockwise, I would counter it by spinning 360 degrees counterclockwise. I would even do this while playing video games. I'm not sure how unusual this is though, as I think this ""technique"" actually can be used to counteract dizziness with how the endolymph in the ear works. So maybe, as a young kid, I subconsciously picked up on this and just did it all the time, even when playing video games. 

2.) As a kid, I guess you could say I had some pretty twisted self-esteem issues. I felt that having OCD made me special, and I think I sort of bought into the mentally ill genius trope that you often see in stories. So I guess I kind of embraced it.

I doubt anything can be said that is going to alleviate my doubts about this, but it would be cool to get some feedback and maybe be pleasantly surprised. I am no longer performing any rituals or any other form of obsessive behavior, but it would be easier to move passed all of this if I knew that this problem that has consumed so much of my life was a genuine one and that I wasn't just some fool who trained himself to feel anxious in response to numbers and superstition, and who deluded himself into believing he had a problem that legitimately affects so many others.",25Apr2019,1
48,"Second post of the night. This one will be shorter, but more serious. It’s a secret that I have never told anybody, but it bothers me all the time. 

2 years ago in the summer of 2017, I received a message from the only person that considered me as a friend through my whole life up to that point. She told me that she had something important to tell me, but that I had to promise to not tell anybody else. Based on the flair and the title, you can probably tell what she said. She sent 3 separate texts “I was thinking about”, “committing”, “suicide”. As a kid, this put a lot of stress on to me. I spent all night researching how to help someone who feels suicidal. I took numerous quotes from every article I could find useful and sent it, of course she didn’t know that I was researching stuff. And whenever they would fit in our conversations I would use them for the next few days. I know I should have told somebody, but she was a pathological liar, from what I have gathered at least. This was all during the summer I was moving half a country away from my old house. We decided to meet up one last time before I would leave. While we were there, neither of us mentioned anything about our text messages. After, she said that she wasn’t thinking about it anymore. Nothing has happened since then, but I still wonder if she lied about changing her mind. It’s far too late to tell anybody. I found out a few days after that that the reason I had 5 years of classes with her, were because she considered me the only person she could trust, and her only friend.",25Apr2019,0

50,"I just found out I am the “sociopath” friend.

Throughout my life I have always wondered why I always had a hard time making (and keeping) friends. When I was young, as early as I can remember, I had no friends at all. I distinctly remember attending summer camp at a young age and being entirely and utterly quiet and anti-social. Back then, I had a fascination with trading cards, because my cousin played with them, and I wanted some too. I spent my entire time at camp stealing trading cards from kids, and the only time I ever interacted with them was to steal from them. This didn’t strike me as wrong at the time, and if a kid ever caught me I would lie to get out of it. I had no remorse for what I did. 

In elementary school, I can recall having friends that I developed. Early on I had an interest in video games so this brought upon my bond with several other kids, which is how I made friends throughout my life. Looking back, I noticed that any time I made friends, I viewed them more like pawns than anything. I had a longing desire to be “cool”, and was constantly in and out of friend groups because I was never satisfied and my goal was to see how I could manipulate or use people to get popular and fit with the “in” crowd. 

Looking back, this never worked. Save for a handful of people, I have failed to hang on to close friends for longer than a year at a time. I mainly treated them as a means to an end. If I was lonely, they were people to talk to so that I would not be lonely. If I met a particularly affectionate and touchy girl, I would keep her around for that purpose and encourage the behavior. I did not see these individuals as people. I did not care. All I cared about was myself and my own motivations. Some (a small handful) of these types of relationships turned into lasting friendships, but this was rare. I never learned how to properly do the whole “empathy” thing. 

I have stolen thousands from family members, lied through my teeth, bullied others, brought others down to feel better about myself, all without a shred of true remorse or empathy. I can’t even write this and feel remorse or empathy or guilt and I don’t understand why. (Edit: I definitely feel guilt) I have neglected family, broken apart friendships, and attracted so much negative energy into my life. Recently, I have had a lot of close people to me call out this type of behavior as they noticed it. 

Me, being the stubborn individual I am, continued to deny I had done anything wrong and insisted that they were at fault and they were to blame. This was a reoccurring theme throughout my life. Here in college, I made what I consider to be my first long term friend group, and very recently I have fought with them and I believe I have finally heard what they were trying to tell me. I just started looking back into my past and it all started to make sense. College was more of the same, I came here, tried to be part of the in-crowd. Met people, lost friends due to me either over sharing or using them or accusing them of something. Had SO many people ghost me (it hurts). Half the time I never even understood or was aware why these people would disappear from my life. 

I believe “anti social personality disorder” fits the bill pretty well to describe the group of behaviors I’m experiencing. Today is the day of realization but I’m already taking slow steps. I have started seeing a therapist, which previously I was far too stubborn to even consider. So that’s a great win for me. And for one I am putting my message out there because for so long I have neglected to post and interact and share my thoughts, so here I am.

53,"There is a cognitive bias called illusory superiority. It means we overestimate our own abilities and qualities. We are inclined to believing we're better drivers, workers, partners, lovers, etc than we actually are. One thing we're especially guilty of is overestimating our own attractiveness, with the vast majority of people rating themselves in the 6 to 8 range on a scale of 0 to 10 where an average looking person would be a 5.

This paralyzes me. I've been trying to work on myself - seeing a CB therapist for social anxiety and apparently depression. I've been told I have low self-esteem and that it's all about changing perspectives. I've been slowly changing my mind about about myself - things like my own attractiveness - but then I read up on this bias. I have no idea what's real. I just want to know my place in the world. Where I rank. I don't want to run around believing I'm something I'm not. Nor do I want to miss out because I'm underestimating myself. I can't trust my brain.

I have always felt that it's not worth doing things if I'm no good at it. The problem is I can't think of anything I'm any good at, so I sit around doing nothing with my life. I never try. I've been told that depression will have this affect. The alterative is to try and start believing that maybe I am good at some things and start doing those. But how far do I take it? How do I know that it's not some cognitive bias telling me that I'm something I'm not?

I’ve mentioned to my stepmom (47f)before that I worry about her kids and that my dads temper is a contributing factor in my mental health.

She believes im just trying to pin it on something. She told me how she has been slapped as a kid and turned out fine. It brings me to tears when I mention how my dad slapped my 9/yo brother. My step mum was unfazed, she thought it wasn’t that bad and that she wasn’t worried about it, how it’s her sons problem and how I shouldn’t get so worked up about it.

She asked me if I still have those thoughts and I told her the last time I did was January, and that instead I scratched my leg as a means of self harm. She was comforting but still believed that I shouldn’t pin it on my dad. She thinks his behaviour is fine.

That Monday march 4 I went into the hospital and I was there a week. Since being home I’ve actually been doing pretty good until Friday. On Friday my brother calls me tells me that my mother is in the hospital. So we set up a time to go see her the next day. Saturday comes and my brother picks me up we go down and see my mom at the hospital. I am told that she has metastatic kidney cancer and that she will probably not live much longer. While we are there my brother is able to get her to eat a little bit of applesauce. We are there and we talk to the palliative care liaison and set up for her to go into comfort care also known as hospice as she is in the advanced stages of Alzheimer’s and is of the age of 73. We finished visiting we say our goodbyes and that we love her and we will see her the next day Sunday. We leave the hospital and my brother brings me home and he goes home and I’m dealing with the news and telling everybody at my home what is going on. After I have been able to vegetate a.k.a. distract from the news of my mother being severely sick and that she was going to die soon for a couple hours I get a phone call. During this phone call my brother tells me that the hospital just called him and that our mother has passed away. My nephew comes and picks me up and I go up to the hospital say my goodbye before they take her to the morgue. Now I know that I should have been prepared for her to pass but I wasn’t ready I’m still not ready. I sit here my depression building again after I just got done with this crap last month and I just I don’t know want to just crawl into a hole and not be seen or heard from for a long time. Sunday I told my son and I could tell he took it hard but he was still trying to Comfort me but I kinda just was trying to focus on him at the moment. I’m hoping that my depression doesn’t build to the point where it was last month where I needed to go to the hospital. Although I can see the depression building I’m hoping it levels out soon. To the point with crying where I am able to still cry some but there’s not many tears coming out. One of the things that makes this so hard is that my brother both of them both brothers my niece nephews sister-in-law uncle and aunt are all in town yet they aren’t even trying to include me. If feels like I’ve been completely left out when it should be all of us together dealing with this. Not all of them being together and be left here by myself.

Hello everyone! First of all, I want to apologize if my post violates any rules, is very long or is difficult to read for any reasons. This is my first time posting in reddit, even though I’ve been a “stalker” of reddit for more than 2 years now. Also, English is not my first language so I kindly ask you all to be understandable for any grammar errors. 

I decided to make this post on this subreddit because undoubtedly I have serious issues with my mental health, but I haven’t been officially diagnosed and constant reading trying to diagnose myself has confused me and directed me to several disorders (bipolar, major depression, anxiety etc.). I am convinced that I suffer from a high level anxiety, but still my symptoms also lead me to other issues as well. And this is the reason I am posting this, I need help from all of you to diagnose myself and treat my potential problems. 

Let me give you a little background of myself before starting to tell you my symptoms/problems. I am a 25 years old male with a Bachelor degree. I am in a very happy relationship, even though we have our ups and downs – that mostly come from my mood change and unstable behavior. Professionally I am doing pretty well, but spend most of my day working only, trying to make myself economically independent and build my future life (for the moment, I don’t have any savings which gives me a lot of stress). Starting from this month, I will be promoted in my job, which means a higher salary – that directly contributes in my objective to be economically independent. I also have a side job/own business that has just recently started to grow. Having all these in mind, my personal and professional life is going well, but is stressful most of the time.  

Let’s get to the main point! I constantly feel stressed, have very low self-esteem and don’t really trust myself. I always worry what others think about me and try to not say anything that can potentially hurt someone. In addition to this, if I don’t get a quick reply on social media for example, or if someone around me is not in a good mood, I always blame myself and can’t stop thinking if I have done anything wrong. I always have a fear that people will reject me, therefore I have started to avoid contact with people, even close relatives. I feel very tired even if I have enough sleep or just chilled the whole day. I always try to keep myself busy, because if I’m not busy doing something, my thoughts go very deep and I start imagining terrible scenarios, think that almost everybody underestimates me and go harsh to myself by considering me to be useless. I am facing gaps in my memory of recent events and also have trouble concentrating, and for the easiest task possible I get very anxious until it is finished. After the task is finished, I am usually not happy with the outputs, even if I get a good feedback from others.  Recently, it has been very hard for me to be happy doing things I enjoy, and I have come to a point where I don’t actually know if I have any hobbies or if i want the career I have. Moreover, I don’t know what career I want to, it seems that I don’t like anything! For a long time now, it’s been hard for me to get turned on, and when I do I get turned off very easily or constantly have premature ejaculation. This has started to cause serious problems in my personal life and contributes to have even lower self-esteem. I never had suicidal thoughts, but recently I see no point to live. I don’t really think of suicide, but the only reason that I probably don’t want to think of that is not ME, but the people around me that would be hurt if something happens to me. I smoke a lot of weed, as I see this a solution to my problems and have never been to a therapist. 

I am so sorry for the long and messy post. I hope I have been clear, but if you have any additional questions for how I am feeling, don’t hesitate to ask me. I hope this wonderful community will help me and suggest me any options on how to treat my problems.",25Apr2019,1

Tulasi Health Care is a widely renowned group of psychiatric nursing homes in Delhi, India providing specialized treatment for substance abuse disorders and mental illnesses.Tulasi was co-founded in 2002 by Dr. Gorav Gupta and Dr. Ruchika Gupta. The operations started with a small, yet highly qualified team comprising of 1 psychiatrist and 2 psychologists. The facility at that time in Mehrauli was sufficient to cater to the needs of 10 patients.

Tulasi Home, an NGO started by the same group, was established in 2006 and commenced its operations with 10 beds, keeping in mind the requirement for a halfway home and rehabilitation centre for chronic psychiatric illnesses.

Moving ahead on the growth ladder, the group has been consistently revamping and enhancing the treatment facilities. Another psychiatric nursing home was started by the group in Mandi,Delhi in the year 2018.With the same, the combined number of active treatment seekers at any point of time reached 125.

With the evolving needs of Mental Health Domain, the group is coming up with its state-of-art facility in Gurgaon, which will be sufficient for additional 125 patients requiring treatment for mental illnesses and addiction disorders. The combined employee strength stands at a proud 100 employees today.",25Apr2019,0
62,For the past month I've struggled to understand what is happening to me. I've cut myself twice this past month. everything has been going fine but every now and then I get these moments when I'm alone where I just tune out and I hear my mind screaming. In these moments I feel like I'm not in control of my self and I start cutting. This has happened only two times this month and I've never experienced anything like this before in my life.when I cut the moment the blade opens my skin I feel a sudden euphoric rush. I want it to stop but and the same time it feels like and escape. I often wish I could stop time.,25Apr2019,2
63,"Things haven’t ever really been easy for me. 

At a very young age (4 max), I spat at my mom. It was stupid but I saw it on tv and copied. Well, she heated up a knife on the cooker and then placed it on my back repeatedly, burning it and telling me that’s my punishment. I still have those scars. 

After secondary school, our family moved to a new city and I was separated from the friends I had from secondary school and they were the first friends I’d ever had. Before university, my parents constantly verbally abused me and broke me down because I had the audacity to go against their wishes and study a subject of my choice. I chose Mathematics. They wanted Medicine so they could parade round their doctor son. Because I did, they broke me down to what I became when I started university. Extremely awkward and socially anxious. Unable to talk to anyone. No confidence in myself. Their abuse made me attempt suicide twice while I was home alone and the rest of my family were in another part of the city. 

I tried counselling and it did not help one bit no matter how many counsellors I tried. I tried meds and the side effects made me feel even worse and want to do horrible stuff to myself. The only thing that actively helped was my ability to depend on friends I had made in secondary school but I didn’t get to see them often enough because we lived so far apart. 

At some point, I couldn’t take it anymore and left. I moved out closer to my university into some shithole room in a house share that was less than 6m squared for around £450 a month. The bed took up a third of the room and the wardrobe/chest of drawers took another third. I blocked my family everywhere but I started getting calls from unknown numbers and police visits to university. Two weeks into signing a contract for this place, I was told I had 30 days to move out as the house had been sold. This led to me moving into university halls accommodation.  I made another friend there. We were very close and would eat together daily but his visa ran out and he left after he graduated from his masters programme. 

That summer, I witnessed a murder. Two muggers murdered a man for his watch and I saw it outside my own window. I worked night shifts at a local store but I couldn’t anymore. Anytime I heard a moped, anxiety would hit 100. I testified in court and the murderer got put away but the whole experience definitely fucked me up more than I knew. 

Throughout all of this, there was a girl I was friends with. She was someone I was able to rely on for everything and was always there for me, as I was with her. We’d only met each other like 5 or 6 times because I was introduced to her as a friend of my closest friend. I had told him about problems I was having and he guided me to her, saying she’s had experience and could help. This guy is someone I see as an older brother and if he trusted her, I trusted her and I told her and that’s how our friendship formed. Around a few weeks after we moved out, she stopped talking to me completely. A few days later, she finally responded with a very simple “Hi, I don’t want to be friends anymore”. The next day she went on to explain that I was a burden on her and my negativity and problems bought her down too and she couldn’t have that. She was right. I didn’t see it at the time but I was bringing her down and I was a burden. We had a long-standing snapchat streak and we kept that going for a month, sending each other blank snaps each day, in case she changed our mind.  She did and we video-called that night. It was the only night I had smiled and felt kind of happy even though the video and audio quality was horrible. She ended that call with “we’re still not friends” and said bye and we hung up. The next day, she said maybe we should call more regularly so we did. Not like it was before but we talked every now and then. Sometimes, she would get really mad at me for no reason at all and then ghost until she pops back up and acts like nothing happened a few days later. Usually, I apologised and waited for her to feel better, messaging hoping for a response. The friendship ended the week after the murder because this happened and an argument started. I don’t know if it was the same on her part, but the friendship turned toxic and it wasn’t healthy for either of us. 

My university work was stressful and I was still getting blocked number phone calls almost daily hurling abuse whenever I made the mistake of answering them. However, despite my terrible social skills, I managed to build up a group of friends and was semi-happy.  One of the friends, I was especially close with. I fell for her and we eventually started dating (Over two years ago now, wow). She was amazing and one day very early into our relationship, she came over because I was ill. She came with my favourite Turkish food that I mentioned once in an off-hand conversation ages before and that was the day I was sure she was the one. I loved her than and I love her even more now. She was the one who pushed me towards trying to mend relations with my family and I was able to, slowly. We took it properly slowly but eventually I was able to visit my family for a night every week. 

At the end of the second year of university, I moved home for the summer. I regret it because it showed me how shit life was and that nothing had really changed. Everything that happened was for show. My mom argued with my sister daily (still does) and they threw insults and horrible words at each other. During these few months, I could only see my girlfriend for a day a week or two days maximum but even this was difficult with my weasel sister telling my parents about her after she snooped through my phone. This was because she was in trouble and had to throw me under the bus. It hurts because I’ve always lied for her to make sure my parents don’t hurt her like they did to me but the slightest bit of trouble and she’d throw me in too and get me into trouble in the hope that it would get them off my back.

 I moved back out as soon as I could, lying about university semester dates, and soon after, I was told by my friend from the time I was in halls that he had a storage unit with a few of his belongings that was gonna get emptied a week after and if I could hang on to them until he came back to the UK. I agreed but then found out a few things was enough boxes to take up a good chunk of my new room. Because they were there for the whole 4 months before he eventually came back to the UK. When he did, I offered to let him stay with me until he found a place. My culture means I have to be hospitable and I offered him the bed and I slept on the floor. I thought it would be ok because it’s just a week or two before he find somewhere. It was a month. A month of working and earning enough money for 1 person but paying for 2. I felt like he took advantage of the situation and had no urgency about finding himself a place. Eventually he did and I am glad because it meant I had my room back, now without boxes. 

As I am in my final year, I have to find a job. I’ve had over 150 applications, around half of which didn’t even bother replying. Out of the ones that did, I got 4 face to face interviews as part of last stage assessments. 2 said no for lack of experience, 1 didn’t respond and the last one was the one I was most confident in. There were 8 candidates at the centre and there were 7 jobs available. I felt like I did really well but I was told I didn’t make the cut. Asking for feedback, the manager said I performed extremely well in the group activity and the individual interview but the interviewer thought my skills are better applied to statistics. I applied for an accountancy role and I did not mention statistics anywhere in my degree. I was so angry at myself. The one time I was confident in my work, I was slapped down through, according to the hiring manager, no fault of my own. I’m still applying for jobs but can’t find any and it’s stressing me out even more. I have been neglecting university studies in the hunt for a job because if I don’t find one, I am scared the abuse will start again. 

I’m scared of the future. My girlfriend and I are both from different cultures that are very racist. My mom expects me to marry within my own race and, because she suspects I have this girlfriend, takes any chance to say horrible stuff about her race. Stuff I can’t bring myself to tell my girlfriend. I have to listen to it and hide it all in because I don’t want my mom’s ignorance to hurt her feelings. Her parents expect the same and aren’t accepting of interracial marriages. When it comes to it, there will be a lot of fighting and I’m scared but I put on a brave face because I know it’ll work and that it’ll be worth it. 

I’m not in a good place. 

All of this is killing me with stress. I often find myself wanting to die but being too scared to commit suicide. I don’t want the people I love to know about the stuff going on and the stuff weighing me down. I don’t want any of them to feel responsible for it in a way and I’m sure it will never happen because of that. But I can’t help wanting to die. Every time I read about a knife attack in London where someone got stabbed or about an accident, part of me can’t help but wish it was me. My problems would be over and the people I love won’t feel responsible or guilty or like they could’ve helped it. I haven’t slept properly in months and I hide it by saying I can handle it. I can’t though. I don’t know what to do and I know the thoughts I have are unhealthy but I can’t help it. I’m not strong enough to keep doing everything I’ve done so far. I just find myself wishing I was dead so I would be at peace with everything. I’ve hidden this from everyone and have an outwardly happy face and I know talking about it with any of them would hurt them. Since I lost one friendship I cared about through my constant problems and being a burden, I can’t bear to lose another. Nobody knows my Reddit account but I can’t risk it in case they do so this is where I decided I wanted to vent it out so at least I’m not the only person that knows. There might be someone somewhere in the world who’s read this and they know too. 

I know it’ll get better eventually but I don’t know if I can do it until then. I know I will never attempt suicide but I can’t help the thoughts of wanting to no longer be alive. I just want to be at peace.",25Apr2019,1
65,"So I've noticed a lot of you here are quite young, and probably not educated the best on a lot of mental health things. I've noticed a lot of people using the term psychotic for themselves, when that's not what they mean. Psychotic is a word that gets used wrong a lot of the time. The actual meaning of psychotic is someone suffering psychosis. Psychosis is:

-Hallucinations

- Delusions, which can be perseuctory delusions such as an organisation is trying to spy on you and kill you, your friends and family want to harm you. Or alternatively, grandiose delusions where you believe you are powerful. These can include believing you are God, or believing you can control those around you.

- Your thoughts would be disturbed and confused. This presents itself in rapid speech, changing topics mid sentence, and abrupt pauses due to losing your train of thought. 

- You will also be unaware that your delusions and hallucinations aren't real. 

When you say you're psychotic, you're essentially saying you're experiencing the above symptoms. However, most posts here I see where people refer to themselves as psychotic, they usually list off some of the lesser known symptoms of depression (reduced emotional reactions being a big one) and believe they are psychopaths. 

People tend to misuse the term psychopath a lot too. People also make the incorrect assumption that being psychotic is the same as being a psychopath. We've already talked about what psychotic means/what psychosis is, so let's do the same for psychopath. 

The actual meaning of psychopath is someone suffering from a long term mental illness causing them to be antisocial and violent. This is usually referring to a very severe form of antisocial personality disorder. It is important to remember that not all people with personality disorders, and not all people specifically with antisocial personality disorder, are psychopaths. Here are some traits of a psychopath:

- They can be manipulative and exploit others for their own personal gain

- They will not feel bad or regret what they did, nor feel concerned about what they are doing

- Disregard normal social behaviour 

- Behave irresponsibly 

- Struggle to maintain relationships 

- Cannot control their anger

- Blame others for problems in their life

- Continuously break the law

- Disregard for their safety or others 

- Impulsive/doesn't plan ahead. 

Keep in mind, that to be diagnosed as a psychopath, or even just as having antisocial personality disorder, you need to have shown misconduct since before the age of fifteen, and you can only be diagnosed with this when you're over eighteen and been through a lot of psychological testing. 

I see a lot of young people here thinking they are psychopaths, usually because they think they lack empathy. It is important to remember that depression can really reduce your emotional responses to things, as it can make you very numb. This is not a lack of empathy. Also, if you're on the autism spectrum, you will experience empathy differently than non autistics. This is not bad and doesn't equate to a lack of empathy. 

I know this is a long post, but I just really wanted to clear up the misconceptions a lot of you have around these terms, because it's very harmful for you to be worrying about being a psychopath when you likely are just struggling with depression. It's also very harmful for those of us who experience psychosis/are psychotic because if we try to talk about that, it will be misconstrued as us being psychopaths.",25Apr2019,24
66,"In the past, I did put myself in situations which weren't very favorable to me. Now it didn't happen to me for a long time ago, but I don't think it is because I changed much. It stopped happening to me probably because I stopped meeting certain people. But I always notice the uncomfortable feeling when I say no to someone. Majority of the time it goes well, because they respect me. Now, what if I will meet the wrong kind person again? I am afraid more of myself than the person. I am afraid that I will betray myself and I will give in to some bullshit they will try to get me into.  And I believe it is because of my victim mentality. I am probably so used to view myself as a victim that I will do stupid stuff despite the fact that I know it is stupid. I probably feel too comfortable with the view that I am a victim.",25Apr2019,1

76,"My best friend has dealt with anxiety and depression for 15yrs. Over the past 8 weeks he has become severely delusional - this is terrifying and totally new to all of us. I had no idea how terrible delusions could be - he truly believes the reality in his head no matter the evidence of the opposite.

His delusions involve thinking his family and friends are trying to harm/kill him. He has bounced between friends and families for the last 4 weeks and is now homeless because his delusions create a huge distrust - he has no income/money and has destroyed all of his identification and communication (phone etc). He had been forced by the police to psychiatric care for 72h (1 week ago for suicidal ideation) where he is on a new anti-psychotic. He should have been held longer, but admitted to me he lies to the psych team about his delusions and ""he needs me to believe him"". They released him 5 days ago.

Yesterday he was charged with a break and enter where he broke into a friend's house because he thinks this friend owes him money. He has no previous criminal record and was released on conditions - the police would not force him to see a psychiatric team.

What the fuck are we supposed to do? He distrusts his friends and family - he lies to the psych teams and police about his delusions - he is now homeless, no ID, no money, and now has a BE charge. We are totally lost - according to the police we essentially have to wait for him to physically harm someone or himself (apparently a break and enter with burglary isn't ""bad enough"").

We are going to a judge today to ask for a forced assessment by a psych team - but considering he lies about his condition we are not hopeful even if the judge signs the form.

77,"I've been feeling sad and just overall tired for many years. More specifically since my summer break ended in 2015. I don't remember it that well but it was around that time, fall 2015 when I had just begun 7th grade that I started to feel this way. I had never really been feeling sad for a longer period of time before that and had nothing bad happening in my life. I don't know why it started there of if that matters. The constant feeling of being sad, or simply not happy has been with me ever since. I have loving parents, lots of friends and I have an overall good life, so I don't see why I would be feeling this way. I am always sad, more or less, I cry often but never around anyone. 

I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts every now and then but this fall/winter I really got into the idea, started planning how I would do it and made lists of things I had to give back, things I wanted to give to people and things I wanted to put away to second hands. I never did anything with it, and it kinda just stopped. But lately the thoughts have been coming back, but not me ending my life now or anytime soon but rather in my 30s. I'm gonna be 17 this summer. 

I am constantly tired no matter how much or how little I sleep, I can go days without eating and one day binge eat on everything I can find. I don't have energy for anything, I don't find anything fun and everything I used to think was fun and enjoyable I now see as a chore. Play games with friends? A chore. Watch a movie with my parents? Chore. 

And school is probably the worst part of this all. I have stopped caring about school in every sense possible, yet I care about it a big deal because I want my parents to be proud. I have two classes in which I have the grade F at the moment, and everything else is around E-D level. I used to have the highest grades in class and had almost all A's. It's come to the point where I just don't care about one thing and then the next thing comes along and I can't possibly care about it since I am behind. 

I've gone to a therapist once but it didn't feel right. And I can't really talk about this with friends or family, it's not that they would be disrespectful or mean about it but I have never been good at talking abou tmy feelings in any way.  What should I do?

I have 5 really really good friends who are all great people but aside them I got no one. I’ve never had an actual girlfriend just some online relationships and we met like once and then it was over. I’m not exactly bad looking I’m just so incredibly shy it’s killing me. When I left my former school in 2018 and went to a new bigger one I had extreme difficulties in finding friends. Like I still have never talked to anyone in the class for more than 5 minutes and it’s been almost a year since we are in a class together. I am really scared of confronting people about anything and hate talking openly I have had some family incidents that have made it harder for me to talk to people but that’s not really important. I now absolved a 9 week internship and my social anxiety was the reason I ended up with a D- i have multiple Ds in my class report because I’m too afraid of saying anything in class. I’ll be returning to school on monday and I’m already afraid of everyone staring at me and judging me for my behavior.

79," I was a survivor of a brutal attack, beating and rape in High school, by two upper classmen. 
 This ordeal sent me into a downward spiral of barbiturates and amphetamines. 
 For the next year I self medicated, trying to numb my soul.

 ""I'm all alone and nobody is going to come to help me.""

85,"My closest friend has been having chest pains and shortness of breath for going on 5 months, it gets worse in stressful situations and she often finds herself getting emotional and crying or feeling suddenly panicked. She had an argument with her family and felt as though her throat were closing up, she had a work event and felt like she was having a heart attack. She’s been to the drs about 10 times and had every test done (X-Rays, camera down throat, full bloods etc).

I have struggled with anxiety all my life and recognise all of these symptons and, as I work with her everyday, I’ve noticed certain things that 100% seem like anxiety. I’m no dr but I’ve tried to tell her this, and so have the DR’s the 10 times she’s been but she refuses to accept that’s what it could be (sometimes being quite hurtful IE, “I’m not a weak person” or “I’m not crazy” or has been mad at me every time I suggest it could be anxiety)

Day in, day out she's throwing herself a huge pity party and inviting everyone – she’s had about 2 weeks off of work and made others pick up her slack almost every day. She won’t go to or do anything. Until now I’ve been completely supportive and there for her as I know how difficult it can be - but it’s starting to get irritating that

86,"Hi,

This is for my brother in law (wife's younger brother). 

He is 22 and is continuously having negative thoughts. It's been a year now and he not able to cope up. All of our family members are really tensed as to what should be done.

He is not able to maintain focus on anything he does. For example, when he is writing, he starts thinking that if he pierces his skin with the nib of pen, how much blood will come. When he is walking, he thinks that if comes under a vehicle, what will happen. 

I suggested him the following from my knowledge, but he not able to keep up with any of these: 

1. Keep focus on what he is doing and what he is supposed to achieve by doing it.
2. When ever a negative thought comes up, try to think anything positive or funny such as watching a comic video or talking to a friend and laughing on old memories.
3. Meditation, that is, concentrating on breath. If any negative thought comes, try to come back to breath.

&amp;#x200B;

If there's any thing that should be done, please help. This is becoming really serious day by day.",25Apr2019,1

He seems stuck in own little world and content with it.

I am morbidly obese and fucking hate it. 4 years ago, I was just obese and felt relatively happy because I didn’t look obese, but now, I look so off-putting and my body is unrecognisable to what it was 4 years ago. 

I just want to lose weight, but I’m always hungry. I serious when I say this. I am literally always hungry and never full. I could eat a massive roast dinner and BAM!! 30 minutes later I feel hungry again. This isn’t normal, is it? Is it the depression causing this? Is it a binge eating disorder causing this? Or is it leptin resistance?

Everyday I feel down and teary. I’m already on 60mg of Prozac and 5mg of an antipsychotic tablet. I hate this way of life.

91,"My sentiments are based on being subscribed to the sub and seeing a pattern in which posts make it into my feed. This is not an attack on the sub, it's a suggestion to represent all the colors of the rainbow here.

This sub seems to mostly pay attention and support people whose mental illness makes it difficult for them to perform basic functions, like getting out of bed. I understand that life with mental illness is like a 10k race. For those struggling with the basics, every day moving a yard feels like a war against yourself, but what about those of us who are sprinting? 

I leave my house daily for work, social gatherings etc but I face many difficulties each day stemming from mental illness. I come here and I make posts about it. Hoping to find someone who feels the same. Who lives that struggle. Just one person who relates and reaches out and says yeah I'm drowning in my own thoughts too. Or hey I used to struggle with that here's what helped me. 

But I get nothing. And I see no posts on my feed from others who live a similar struggle. I'm sure they're out there, but their posts get buried or if they're anything like me, they delete them later because if no one feels the same, what's the point. All the support goes to the ones who seem to be struggling the most outwardly.

It reminds me of when I was a kid, and I had a troubled sister. I went to school, had poems put in the newspaper, great grades and had a few short stories published in books, but no one in my home paid any mind. When I left for college I asked my mother why she left me to my own devices so often. Why she didn't put so much effort into me like with my sister. She replied; ""because you've always done so well on your own, I didn't think you need me."" That has stuck with me even to this day,and that's how I feel about this sub. 

The support isn't shared and I think we all could do more to make sure there's a variety of lifestyles affected by mental illness getting the attention they deserve. No struggle is worth more than another, but they all need some help.",25Apr2019,393

94,"So I've always had trouble with intimate relationships. When growing up, I always wanted to be closer to my older brother so I'd 'copy' what he did. Most of the time, I'd end up putting a lot of work in whatever that was and spent more time which meant I eventually got better than him. He didn't like this and I'm not sure what he felt, but in the end he sure took it out on me. It wasn't physical, but he made sure he would try his damndest to make me not feel good about whatever I was doing. He did this for probably over 10 years in the earliest days of my life.

I'd go to my parents, but nothing much was ever done. Video games would become my main escape from all of this and they'd make me feel much better. This was because I was able to put my emotions on the line for a game which may sound bad, but whenever I was able to do what I wanted, I felt good and it didn't matter what anyone else thought. It was me who did it.

Fast forward, I've had one girlfriend before where our relationship formed with relatively low levels of stress as I was starting to get over it and had found a group of friends where I felt accepted. My brother was also in this group, but at one point we went down separate paths and there was a 'split'. At this point we've been friends for 7 years and there has been some splits, but we are all bad at meeting new people which has become a problem.  Me and that girl have been broken up for years and it didn't end too well for me. She just fell out of it and didn't have feeling for me anymore which was really hard for me to handle. I tried using my hurt to make me grow, but due to circumstance and some poor decisions on my part, I wasn't able to do that for as long as I felt like I needed. 

One big thing me and my friends did was to smoke a lot of weed. We did this just to have fun and enjoy time especially since we didn't have too much else in common. It was around this time I think I started smoking not to have fun, but as an attempt to numb myself so I wouldn't hurt anymore. I've come to figure out weed can work like that, but only for as long as you let it. I think I realized this around a year and a half to two years ago now. I still smoke it as for awhile I was able to have fun with it again and not use it to cope, but as soon as I put any of my self worth on an external thing I feel myself crack under the pressure. Well I say any, but that's simply not true.

It's only intimate relationships where I feel this pressure. Whenever I try to have a deeper relationship with a girl, I find myself panicking. I think a big part of it is that I'm scared to open up to girls because a lot of what I've been feeling over the past few years is just loneliness and not too much good. Like I said before, I literally feel myself cracking under the pressure from myself which has some drastic effects. I think I enter fight or flight mode and sometimes I kind of get stuck in it when feeling insecure about the relationship. I guess part of me also feels like I'm not good enough which I've been starting to realize stems in part at least from how my brother treated things I felt good about doing when I was younger. Even if I was good and maybe better than him, I wouldn't feel good enough.

Well I asked this girl out who I really like for the second time and she said yes. As I've done before, I'm doing the samething I did before and am now in fight or flight again. This time it's really bad to the point where I feel like I'm starting to try and self sabotage which would only further make me feel worse. The reason i think I'm doing this is that I'm in fight or flight so by sabotaging, my brain thinks it gives me a chance for flight when the reality is there's nothing to flight from. It's all in my head so all this flighting is pointless and I think I must fight, but I don't feel strong enough. 

I'm not able to see my therapist until next Wednesday and had to stop for a couple weeks. I've made a lot of progress and am worried how I'll react to things moving forward in the next week if I can't break this. I've never wanted to use medication for this as I've seen what it does to my friends, but when it's this debilitating I really don't know what to do. I know weed will only worsen my symptoms also, but sometimes I trick myself I'm feeling better and then I'll smoke and feel worse. I guess I know now I'm really not ready for relationships, but am terrified I never will be since in already 22. I feel like I really need a more intimate relationship, but if it does this to me i don't know what to do. I feel like it tears me apart that I really want a relationship, but at the same time am reacting like this so I know I'm not ready for one. This will also be the only place I mention this as I don't want to be put in a facility: suicide has been starting to cross my mind which terrifies me more. I feel like these emotions and thoughts just won't stop which is causing the ship to sink way faster than i thought I'd ever do to myself. I've never thought this way before and it brings me further down that I'm feeling that cornered by myself at this point.


Should I ask for medication this time? What in the hell should I do to get myself out of fight or flight with myself so I can get on with my life? How do I stop this sinking ship?

Tl;dr: in constant fight or flight with myself and don't know what to do. I feel like I'm going to start sabotaging myself as a reaction in attempt to flight when there's nothing to flight from. I feel myself sinking my own ship way quicker than I ever thought I could do and am panicking because I know I'll only feel worse. What do I do? Thanks.",25Apr2019,1
95,"I'm in my mid twenties and I live in the EU (Austria).

A lot of my experiences seem to be pointing towards me having depression. Although I am not sure if it's that or maybe something else.

* I feel anxious and nervous all the time. It feels like there is always something unknown on the horizon. Even during the holidays when I have literally nothing to do. I always feel like I should be doing something but I'm just sitting there doing nothing and it makes me feel awful. I'm sure you guys can relate.
* I haven't made new friends in over 10 years, because I fear that I might be fundamentally different from everyone else, and that I cannot form a real connection with anybody. 
* Often this feeling of despair overcomes me. Like a grey wave of nihilism. I then don't see a reason to ever leave my room or really do or try anything because it seems pointless.
* I'm falling behind in my studies, even though i love what I'm doing. There is this barrier that won't let me do any work. 
* General feelings of inadequacy, apathy towards myself, feeling useless and like a failure.  

Anyways I can't go on like this (especially because I cannot focus on my studies, which are very important to me) and I want to get diagnosed and get some help (meds). However I'm unsure how to go about doing that.

Do I just call my doctor and make an appointment specifically asking to get diagnosed about depression? 

Do I just make an appointment to discuss my mental health? If so what exactly do I say.? 

Do I call a therapist?",25Apr2019,6
96,"My boyfriend (28) and I (26F) are in a relationship for almost 6 months now and we were friends for about one year prior to that. I struggle with a major depressive episode right now and unfortunately we started dating exactly when all of this began. We live in different cities (around 250km between us) but still see each other almost every weekend for 3 days or sometimes even more.

I'm really insecure and I think that I have an anxious attachment type. Therefore I'm convinced that he does not love me enough, that he is going to find someone better soon or that he'll realize that I'm not that attractive. Even though he doesn't really give me any reason to think so. We are both really happy to have found each other and are convinced that we'll marry in the future, since we love each other and are just extremely compatible. He even said that he doubts that he would ever find someone who is as perfect as me again, because we share the same values, political views (which is very important for him), neither of us wants to have children and we just enjoy the same activities (gaming, hiking, rather stay at home than partying and so on).

Unfortunately I'm about to ruin everything with my depression and anxious attachment. He's getting more and more frustrated because the love he gives me never seems to be enough, he takes many of my fears and negative feelings personal. If we see each other, everything is fine most of the time. But when we are apart and texting, things escalate quickly due to my anxiety. He's tired of reassuring me all the time and started to be cold and annoyed with my problems. Right now I'm not entirely sure wether I'm the only one who's behaving in a bad way or wether he also makes mistakes by his reactions which make everything even worse for me. We are at a point where we fail to communicate about our problems in a healthy way.

I should add that I'm aware of my problems and want to do something about them. I started to take an antidepressant and are going to look for a therapist soon. So I don't expect him to deal with my shit forever and really want to change myself. 

So my question is: how do you deal with mental health problems in a relationship? What can the healthy or more healthy partner do in order to support the sick one without sacrificing too much?

I never keep my debit card in my smaller purse so I don't know why I didn't think about that as we were leaving to specifically go to the ATM.

We get to the ATM, he goes first and I'm browsing. He's done and I'm next, I put my card in and select $40. He asks if we should get a large fountain drink to split between us. I say yeah that sounds good. He says he'll wait in the car, and I start looking at the fountain drinks. There are no large fountain drink containers. The receipt pops out from the ATM and I grab it. and I go outside and tell him there were no large ones so I didn't get one, it's not worth it.

A couple months ago, I got diagnosed with depression and since then, life has just been a nightmare. I don’t want to complain too much here on a public scope. I turned to the internet as something of a last resort, I lost pretty much all my friends and my family are no longer available to support me.

One day you finally knew
what you had to do, and began,
though the voices around you
kept shouting
their bad advice–
though the whole house
began to tremble
and you felt the old tug
at your ankles.
“Mend my life!”
each voice cried.
But you didn’t stop.
You knew what you had to do,
though the wind pried
with its stiff fingers
at the very foundations,
though their melancholy
was terrible.
It was already late
enough, and a wild night,
and the road full of fallen
branches and stones.
But little by little,
as you left their voices behind,
the stars began to burn
through the sheets of clouds,
and there was a new voice
which you slowly
recognized as your own,
that kept you company
as you strode deeper and deeper
into the world,
determined to do
the only thing you could do–
determined to save
the only life you could save.

When we finally started to talk, I mentioned that maybe I was under more stress from my day-to-day life than I realized and that I think it finally caught up with me. She mentioned that I might benefit from seeing a psychologist. 

I've been curious about therapy for a few years. I can't quite explain it, but I feel like I'm not quite the person I could be. There's not any one particular issue, just a few minor problems that I think could be mental: Stress, lack of confidence, maybe a little anxiety, I feel fatigued a lot, etc. Nothing that is totally crippling, but also nothing that is making me run to a shrink yelling ""Doc, you've got to cure my ________ before it's too late."" 

I don't really know what I'm feeling. There's the feelings I mentioned above, but I feel like they are pretty common and I'm not sure if what I'm feeling is normal or not. What I kind of want to to just talk to someone and see what conclusions they reach. Is that how therapy works? Do I need to have a specific reason for starting therapy?

108,"Not sure if this is the right wording, because I never have been diagnosed with social anxiety, but I swear I had problems with it. As a kid I hated recess because I was scared of asking the other kids to let me play with them. Later, I had friends who I was talkative around but petrified of everyone else. It took me forever to be able to order my own food. I constantly got picked 'most quiet kid in class' or made fun of for being quiet. 
Then, in high school, I was bullied a lot by a few kids. I always told myself that eventually I would be able to talk to some of the kids that didnt know me and make more than just 1 or 2 friends but...never happened. Then senior year came around and I stopped caring about high school and stopped caring if kids were bullying me.

Than I went to college, and almost overnight it seems like my social anxiety disappeared almost completely. Even the small traces I had of it like being weird with roommates (due to being embarrassed living with someone else), or talking to customers at work eventually disappeared. I became the student that asked the professors all the questions. The only time it showed up a tiny bit was doing a project where I have to speak but even that was getting better.

Hello, so long story short, I’m 24, had pretty bad depression since I was 13 but it became catastrophic when I turned 23, and now two months ago I moved home to West Virginia after resigning from my job in Washington, DC to basically recover, go to tons of therapy, and relaunch my life and ultimately find a new city and career.  

While I’m here, I would love to live life authentic to who i am.  That doesn’t mean running down the streets wearing lipstick and a rainbow flag.  the funny part is I have actually been fully out with every friend I’ve made since my first day of college back in 2013, but it’s something that only like 3 friends in West Virginia knew and they have since moved away.  While I’m here,  I just want to be unafraid of acknowledging my fundamental truth (like if someone asks me if I’m seeing anyone, i wanna be like no i haven’t met the right guy yet), go to the local pride organization’s summer picnics, and go to the one gay bar in the region because i have literally no friends left in this town and my parents don’t want most people they know to see me because they’re very embarrassed that my mental health collapsed and i had to move home.  I want to just be myself and unashamed.  

My mom is completely opposed to this.   She knows I am gay but my stepdad and 8 year old brother do not.   My stepdad is a very successful business owner in our region.  She says the things I mentioned earlier are selfish because I will damage my stepdad’s reputation and being out will result in my little brother getting bullied at school.  She says that i owe it to my stepdad and his dad for them to not have to deal with awkward questions from their friends. She says that when I recover and relaunch my life I’ll be going to a more metropolitan area anyway, so I should do the right thing and wait until I’m far away enough that no one in town will know about that side of me.   

They legitimately are doing a great deal for me.  They are giving me a place to live during this total collapse of my life and are paying for my therapy and other incidentals like food, so do I owe it to them to suck it up and go back in the closet until I relaunch my life?  Or is there a way for me to be true to myself even while I’m staying in “their” town while I recover my sanity?

But I can't because I have to be the reaponsible adult and get through my work day and a few other things. And I will do it because it's expected.

115,"Hey Reddit im a 20 year old male, and I just thought id pop in with something that's currently on my mind. So ive always dealt with anxiety never been treated or diagnosed tough. Lately ive noticed it spike to the point whrere I get panic attacks every now and then. I've put thought into going to a professional for help and feel that I'm finally ready. My gf is very supportive as she suffers from depression herself. 

I opened up to my mother about it and told her I want to see a psychiatrist. She told me ""you should see a therapist all a psychiatrist will do is put you on drugs"" I see her point because we have some history of prescription drug abuse in our family but at the same time I feel anxiety medication once or twice a week could help me alot. My gf is prescribed medicine for her panic attacks and she'll give me one if im having a panic attack and it really feels like it evens out my anxiety levels for like a week after. 

I don't want to get dependent on medication but I also think it could help me. People with experience in this what would your advice be?",25Apr2019,2
116,"Here's my issue.  Sometimes my body or brain gets confused when I'm trying to exercise.

I'll be on the treadmill, getting my heart rate up a bit, and all of a sudden I'll start to cry.  Sometimes it's just a few tears, no big deal.  I'll tell myself, ""Your brain is broke and it thinks your under stress because of your disorder.""

   Sometimes I'll ride the bike and reading a magazine, get a little sweaty, and then I'll get nauseous, shaky, or my chest will start to tighten.  Even if I've only been on for 5-10 minutes.

Besides a few extra pounds I put on due to depression, I'm a fairly active person (Thanks GAD!).

117,"My mom posted something online that was offensive to Islam, and she says a fatwa was issued for her head. She said she avoids medical services because an Arab doctor at the clinic she goes to drugged her with sleeping gas and put a tracking chip in her breast while she was unconscious.

She got banned from a store for calling a woman a terrorist in front of her kid, and then she got arrested for going back there and demanding to see the security tapes. The police required a mental evaluation, but she got to go home after two days in the hospital. She doesn't think anything is wrong with her and blames Islam for her problems.

About 6 years ago I remember my mental state being “lightweight” and I felt I was mostly present. Everything overall felt like a fuller, more “elevated” experience.

Today, and for the past few years, I think about my mental state and everything seems heavier. I’m also always turned inward and I don’t know why. I don’t even notice it half the time. I can catch myself, turn myself outward and find that same feeling as I had 6 years ago but it’s unsustainable. I end up falling into the heavier feeling and inward thinking.

122,"Back story I guess. I've been married to a wonderful man for 2 years. The first 2 were absolutely amazing. I had a job and a purpose and didn't mind my husband working 14 hour days in the film industry. I stayed busy and we enjoyed the time we did have together. 
I've always dealt with anxiety and depression but on a minor level, I was definitely able to handle my shit. 
Two years ago I had my son, perfect pregnancy with the perfect man, easy delivery, great support network! But something happened, PPD hit me hard. I ended up in the ER 15 hours after being released because of a panic attack, got put on Zoloft and didn't touch my son for two days. I completely checked out for two weeks. My husband and mom did everything for the most part. I cried at every little thing. I would hold my son and just bawl my eyes out. I didn't feel this overwhelming gush of love and it made me feel even worse, I was protective of him though. 
I went from working a job I enjoyed to being a stay at home mom and my world went dark. I try to stay busy. I see friends and family, I go to the gym but I feel like I'm drowning. I cry all the time, I feel lonely and anxious and just completely lost. 
I found out 4 and a half months ago that I was pregnant again. I'm trying so hard to be happy but I wasn't ready. I'm still not ready and the guilt is killing me. I feel like I'm falling apart. I do my best to keep it together and slap on a smile. I do speak openly about my PPD and my every other week therapy appointments but I hide how bad it really is. I don't like pity and it's embarrassing. I love adamn good life, why should I have anything to be depressed about? I hate it when someone sees me cry and I am sick of crying. I'm sick of not being able to shut my brain off. I'm terrified of having another child and completely shutting down again. I'm terrified of the isolation. I just want it all to stop. I talk about it, I workout, I go to therapy but nothing is helping and I don't know what to do. I declined Zoloft while pregnant because of the risks, no matter how low they are I just can't do it. I would hate myself if anything happened because I couldn't get my shit together for 20 more weeks. 
My doctor knows what's going on and is ready to have my medicine ready for after birth but still. I'm terrified, I'm lonely, I don't want to cry anymore.

127,"I've been friends with this guy for years, we're not very close but I like him and we have the same friendship group. The thing is, I found out a Twitter thread that he wrote months ago about how he's really depressed, how he lies all the time and wishes he wouldn't. He doesn't know I read this, it was just a random search I did, he's anonymous in that account but I'm 90% sure it's him. It all makes sense now because he made really ridiculous lies before that me and our friends believed because he's very convincing. That he won 500k in the lottery but then it was taken away because they had issued two tickets with the same number, that a crackhead and him went out running when they randomly met in the park, that his aunt had a tumor but it went away miraculously ...etc.

In real life he seems very tough and confident, and often mocks people for the same things that he seems to be going through, he's gets really defensive and has a really bad temper. I did not expect him to sound so miserable in that thread. Should I tell him I found that thread and confront him about his lies? No one likes knowing they've been stalked. I looked up other Reddit posts and the responses about similar situations to mine were really judgmental and mean towards pathological liars, I want to help him, not tell him he's a POS. I'm worried that if I tell him I found that thread, he might harm himself or do something worse, because he sounded really worried about people finding out but at the same time, he said no one knows he lies so much and he was asking for help in that thread, because he can't stop it. Should I be the first person to tell him? I don't care that he lies, it doesn't affect me. Perhaps it's not really my place to say anything?

We've been married for about 10 months and before, we were long distance and I struggled deeply with depression, anxiety attacks, and just flat out going crazy because of being long distance. She had the same issues, too. Anyway, all of her teenage life, she told me that she struggled with OCD, depression, anxiety, and basically all of the above. Nothing too extreme but she did see therapist's and professionals to seek help and while I know that these disorders were real, it never occurred to me that I had them, too.
I would have these ""freak out"" episodes over just the most silly stuff. I just didn't understand. But I really REALLY start to notice it when it was pointed out to me, by of course, my then girlfriend/now my wife. I do believe I have depression, anxiety, IED, and OCD but here these last few months, the intermittent explosive disorder has gotten out of hand and my wife doesn't seem to think it's mental, not in the slightest and that it's just me ""acting out"" and me complaining or not getting my way.

130,"Writing on mobile on a break so forgive the formatting.

I've spent about two weeks at a mental rock bottom. Constant over-thinking and emotional distress. I've had manic episodes and fell into a terrible habit of drinking and cocaine abuse.

Two months ago I was really stressed about work. It was a busy time of year and I was working ridiculous amounts of time trying to hold together my 10 buildings. Calls poured in all day on top of regular duties and many running projects.

Around this time the nightmares started. Every night I would wake up every two hours drenched in sweat and panicking. This led to a constant state of exhaustion, taking a huge toll on my mental health.

Since these come in threes I had also started dating a really wonderful woman that helped take some of the stress away. We had an amazing time when we were together, more fun than I've had in a long time. We both fell in love, but unfortunately her long standing mental health issues led to a very sudden disconnect. In 24 hours it went from texting and talking all the time to minimal if any communication. The relationship just fell apart in a week and it utterly crushed me. It hurt so much more than any other breakup because I really did love her dearly and it was the first time I ever felt that kind of love for somebody.

This is where the spiral began. I started to party really hard to drown out my thoughts. During the work week I would get home and have a couple beers, wait for roommates, and when they got home we would drink vodka. The booze helped me sleep, it kept the heartbreak off my mind, and reduced my stress from working so hard. On the weekends it went completely out of control. My friends and I had all had our hard partying years but we had all slowed down quite a bit. I jumped back into it. Friday night I would start drinking with my friends, a common occurance, but far more than usual. I would pick up at least an 8-ball of coke, a 40 of vodka, and get absolutely trashed until Saturday afternoon. Saturday night would go the same, and by Sunday I would be a wreck. Sleep all day then wake up and start the week over. This went on for at least 6 weeks but I don't really remember well because I was in a haze the entire time. I was an emotional wreck and found some degree of joy in just letting go of myself.

Last weekend was where it all came to a head. Easter weekend so I got Friday off. Started the party on Thursday evening and went on until 9 the next morning. Slept two hours then went home to get ready for Excision. Pre-partied for a while and did a bunch of coke, got my molly ready then went and had a really fun time with a ton of friends, rolled really hard, drank more. Eventually we end up at the after party at my buddies place. I started on my 40 of vodka and went to town on my coke. This continued until SUNDAY! 10 in the morning and I finally go to sleep. I slept a total of five hours from Thursday to Sunday. I did enough cocaine to kill an elephant and went on booze runs I can't even remember.

Two of my best friends had noticed how I had hit a serious spiral into apathy and self-destruction. They each started talking to me on Monday about how they saw a decent and kind person quickly turning into a shell of my former self. A wake-up call I desperately needed. I got the chance to vent my problems and hear a level headed opinion of what I need to do to turn it around. My emotions had taken hold of me and impulsivity without restraint was how I was spending my days. They empathized and understood because they have their demons as well, but saw my way of coping and really dug into me about how unhealthy it was. They pulled me back, gave me a dose of reality, showed kindness in harsh words, and it saved me.

I'm now on the fourth day sober and hashing these things out in my head. I feel okay again and it's thanks to a couple of friends that took the time to reach out and show real concern to someone that was quietly drowning. I owe them a lot.

So to anyone else that is in a spiral I would hope you take note and try to talk to someone about it instead of self medicating and letting your woes swim around in your head unchecked. People do care even if you feel like they don't. It hurts more to let yourself go than it does to face the problems, because theres not enough cocaine or booze in the world to make you forget what causes your hurt. Your mental health is important.

Thanks Reddit, for giving me a place to vent this.",25Apr2019,2

I'll keep this as brief as possible


he is quite glad to steal small things like money from his parents, he insults them over stuff like sneezing but talks about how they treat him like shit. I've seen them be very rude to him before but he is the majority of the problem. 

He brags about skipping class or not going to work, he brags about being a drunk and talks about how he's given up on improving his life but expects me to listen t him complain for an hour straight.

It was like he wanted me to slide back into alcoholism because it benefits him even though I was suicidal back then and did nothing with my life for years

He won't stop talking about politics even though I've said many times to not talk about it with me, especially on race. He can't name a single policy of most candidates, including ones he passionately loves and hates, and talks about how Muslims are savages who should be nuked but he's not racist because *islam isn't a race* and *hes nice to Muslims in real life*. I don't fuckin want to hear his ignorant bullshit. It's disgusting. He made a fact today and when I googled it and all the results proved him wrong he said he won't change his mind because everyone makes stuff up in politics.

I love her a lot and I don't want to lose her.

As of a couple months ago she goes to regular therapy appointments but I don't believe she has one in the near future (longer than a week). She already has an appointment with a psychiatrist scheduled for next month (she had one earlier but was unable to go) and she's okay with waiting until then to get treatment and talk with a professional about her mental, but I'm very cautious to wait that long, especially after last night. I would greatly prefer that she sees someone within the week or ASAP. She's not very proactive about coming up with a plan herself (greatly due to the depressive episode) so right now I'm doing all of the work I can to find her something to help solve this.

I know how long it can take to get an appointment with a psychiatrist, so I understand that there may not be faster options but I'm looking for any recommendations for me or any services I can look into to get her help faster, or at least a support system that isn't only me (I can do my best but I'm only human; I'd feel safer if she had other options).

How can I come to terms with being an asshole or a jerk so I can change who I am? I don’t feel I am exactly one of those, but I think I’m just in denial. I constantly will spiral down and have these meltdowns and I don’t know why that is. I’m just constantly overwhelmed. Little things seem to set me off and I don’t know why. The other day I fell off my bike, that only made me a little frustrated, but I decided to stop and pump up my tires and for some reason I got so angry I resorted to just saying my bike was a piece of garbage and... just a fit of rage in general. And it went on until I ripped the valve of the tire and had to walk 4 miles to get home. 

For some reason I am very critical of myself and the world around me. I don’t exactly criticize other people (I don’t tell people I’m better than them, I don’t even think I’m better than other people), I just can’t stand it when things, especially in my house aren’t in order. And I can never look at anything I have ever done and be proud of it. There is always something wrong with my performance to me. Nothing I do is ever good enough. I can’t make a simple mistake without being heavily embarrassed or bothered by it, to the point where that little mistake will follow me around for the rest of the day. Such as being wrong in an argument, even a little one. It’s not that I want to prove I’m right, I’m just so embarrassed that I made such an ass of myself. I just can’t be happy with the person I am in general. The things I do, the things I say, the clothes I wear, the way I look, and just the way I live constantly annoy me. I am literally my own worst enemy; to the point where I look at photos of my self, even photos of when I was a little kid, and think about how awesome it would be to punch myself in the face. 

I constantly do things for others and it seems like I never get anything in return. I guess I’m just a martyr.And getting back to the meltdown thing, I can’t help but to complain. I really can’t. It just happens and I barely have control over it, though it mostly only happens when I’m alone and not actively helping someone. I guess I just have no where to vent or something like that.

Therefore I realized that the issues of his distance were not to do with his lack of love towards me. I have discussed with his family (sisters and mother) about these walls he has recently placed around himself, but they do not know him well and to them, they cannot see a difference. 

My BF is not someone who shares his deep emotions easily, however, recently I have noticed him pulling away from me, sharing his excitement for us in the future before suddenly changing and going in on himself. He has told me before that all his long term relationships never last longer than three years and I fear this is a worry for him.  I am trying to be as understanding as possible without being too over the top or too much but I do not know how best to stop him creating these walls around his emotions. His family has a history of depression and suicide so I worry he may have these tendencies. He is being deployed abroad for two years soon and I want to sort out any issues of communication we have before he goes away. I love him so much but I fear for his mental health and his ability to share his emotions, what is the correct way to try to stop someone pushing you away and building walls around their emotions.",25Apr2019,1

144,"I’m 16 years old and it feels as if my life has lost all meaning. Despite the fact that my age will immediately turn off most readers, whoever seeks to read this will garner some understanding and can hopefully offer some insight into why I feel the way I do and what to do about it.

I live in a bubble. I go to one of the best schools in the country and live better than the majority of my extended family. The place I live is incredibly diverse, but i feel as if it does not accurately represent the attitudes that i have encountered. In spite of this socioeconomic and racial diversity, my entire life has been here, and I feel trapped. Not because of parents who are negligent, or being bullied at school, but i feel completely trapped in my habits. I feel as if I am torn between two worlds and in more ways than one I am. 

I do not fit. Not that i don’t fit in, I do, better than a lot of my peers, but there are a far greater amount better socialized than I, who are aware of the way that their lives are connected. They have immense knowledge, and my school is one of the top ranked in the country. As a result, some of my friends are scoring in the 1500+ range of the SATs, participating in universally acclaimed academic programs, and countless other things that i don’t care to name. My not fitting comes in that I have lost the motivation necessary to catch up to them in their achievements. I know I have the capability, but there’s just something missing from who I am that makes me so different from everyone else. 

I suspect mental illness. Those who have mental illness are more than welcome to diagnose me as just another suburban kid with affluenza, which I unironically acknowledge I might be, but ever since the age of 6 There have been major issues with me finding effective ways to socialize. 

I have friends, but I don’t feel like they are really mine in any capacity. they are close. We don’t talk about personal shit, or communicate our issues with things, we just do stupid shit together and have fun while doing it. When i say that I don’t own them, I don’t call them my friends. They are more so the people who hang out with me. Our relationships are not intimate, and it bothers me because i can’t say any of this to them.

For those who have made it this far, thank you. The reason why i can talk about myself so much is because I spend most of my time alone, absorbing my thoughts and incessantly cycling them, conjuring up delusions and justifying addictions. I am not happy doing this. I’m incredibly self-absorbed, to the point where i’ve had to close myself off to all types of scrutiny for my individuality. I am introverted, partially due to me harboring two equal and opposite ideas of the world,  but i don’t want to be. This sucks because i am a guy who is very visually intimidating. Non-approachable. I want to be better, to not be so het up in all my issues, but the only way i’ve found to stifle the constant reminders of my inadequacy is indulgence, through the forms available to an American 16 year old. 

I can only attempt to describe my problem and this will likely get buried anyway, but it’s a shot in the dark for me because I have been struggling to cope with this with no one to talk to for so long now i don’t know what to do. 

Ultimately I must address that I am in need of some sort of professional help, but I have no way of getting it, and I fear that my life’s meaning will not return. I post this aware of (1st how fucking long it is, and 2nd) of how it might just entirely be me and my imagined suffering but, hopefully in my willingness to acknowledge that, i can find honesty in whoever may choose to respond to this. 

TL,DR: 16 year old believes (undiagnosed) mental illness is reason for irrational and self-destructive behaviors. Seeking advice for finding friends that fit, or just any small tips about how to improve life through small,  manageable changes (other than sleep, water and exercise).",25Apr2019,3

146,"So a year and a bit ago, I was so non functioning due to my anxiety and depression that I wound up in the hospital. At the time I was dealing with some minor depression but some very bad anxiety. When I get anxious, my thoughts spiral, I feel like I’ve lost control, and my appetite completely goes away, to the point where I feel physically ill while eating and end up losing weight. Im already pretty underweight already so any weight loss is not good. My libido is already very low and when I’m anxious, it’s non-existent. I was put on cipralex, and it did help my anxiety. I’ve also been using cannabis (I live in Canada so it’s legal) to help boost my appetite and my libido, but I only use it at night before bed. The other night, while I was high, I realized that I have some background anxiety which I probably wasn’t even aware of. And due to that, if I’m not high, eating is still kind of a chore. I don’t get excited about food like everyone else unless I’ve used cannabis. My libido is also still low, and unless I’m stoned, it’s pretty pitiful, to the point that when I start seeing a new partner, the thought of sex is almost unappealing. I don’t really get horny, I have a hard time staying hard, and have a very hard time reaching orgasm. Before anyone mentions anything about how cipralex can have sexual side effects, I know about them, and I’ve been having this sexual problem even before going on meds.

How have you gotten around this background anxiety? It’s almost like I’ve gotten used to it, and it’s my every day normal feeling. The meds have definitely taken an edge off the anxiety, but I feel like I could be better. I don’t want to up my dosage, but I also don’t want to resign myself to always feeling meh about food and sex.",25Apr2019,1

149,"TL;DR at the end! Hi guys, F19 here! I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for self help books or techniques that might help me out. I moved out almost a year ago but still struggle with feeling okay by myself. Some nights this means I feel very alone and hopeless and struggle to avoid negative coping mechanisms, and other times it simply means trying to have the motivation and courage to go out and try new things! I want to be challenged to do things I love like going out in nature or reading a book, but it’s so hard to leave my room sometimes. I’ve noticed that lately I’ve been avoiding having to think at all, I occupy all my time with watching TV to drain my brain or keeping busy. I want to learn how to discover myself and deal with my feelings, but I don’t know where to start. Does anyone have any skills they use to help with self acceptance and exploration? Maybe meditation? Or any self help books? Any advice is appreciated. 

TL;DR: Do you have any suggestions on self help books or new skills I can use to learn how to be comfortable with my thoughts and explore myself?",25Apr2019,1
150,"First of all, apologies for the shitty title. A fairly recent comment from someone close to me made me realise that I have anxiety, and it can get pretty bad. It doesn’t really interfere with my “normal” daily life most of the times but anytime I find myself in or leading up to (most of the times 1 to 2 weeks before) a stressful situation -like an exam, a concert,...- I literally FREAK. I get physically sick, hyperventilate, am often short on breath, my brain resorts to total chaos and I lose all ability to be rational. In those moments I always wish I could just die for a week and come back afterwards... 
I feel like it is getting a lot worse as time progresses and I don’t really know what to do? I guess I could try to find a therapist, but I have the time nor the money for that at this point in time and aside from this anxiety I am actually really happy with my life. 

Up until about a month ago I just thought of it as stress since I have a mild form of OCD and am a huge perfectionist so I tend to put an unhealthy amount of pressure on myself. It wasn’t until some people around me pointed out that it really wasn’t normal that I realised it really is increasingly getting significantly worse. I’m really not sure if this is just a thing I should deal with myself? Can I “learn” to be less demanding of myself? Are there ways to control anxiety?

Thanks in advance!",25Apr2019,1
151,"I really need to talk to someone but I don’t have a person to talk to so I’m going to talk about it on here. Just for context, I tend to have episodes of bad anxiety and separately, episodes of depression. (I would like to clarify I am genuine, I’m diagnosed and actually suffering. I don’t like to talk about it because it’s very difficult for me) I’ve currently had 2 episodes of anxiety lasting several months and 2 episodes of depression lasting several months also. Anxiety affects me constantly but is more manageable when I’m not having an “anxious episode”, whereas unless I’m having an episode of depression it’s pretty low key. The last time I felt really depressed was about early September to late November 2018. It got so bad I attempted suicide. But since this point I’ve slowly but surely began to feel more normal. Up until 3 days ago. On the 23rd, I had my first panic attack in 9 months. After basically being forced into a new class full of mostly condescending boys that I didn’t know, I asked to be moved but that teacher is so stubborn. I ended up having to leave the room within 10 minutes of being there. It happened to be my birthday. Yesterday was also pretty awful that was mainly caused by another teacher with a similar attitude, I felt so sick all day. And today even though I saw neither teacher all day, I was so anxious I could barely concentrate. I can feel myself slipping into an episode. And it makes me feel rubbish because there’s nothing I can do about it. I guess that’s all I have to say. I’m just feeling really crappy right now",25Apr2019,1

The only ""support"" I really have is with my parents and I don't really feel comfortable with telling them with what I have been dealing with lately.  I have no girlfriend and I only live with my parents.  It seems like Life is just passing on without me.  I'm struggling to get a full time job,  etc.  I know I shouldn't be complaining but at the same time,  I'm not really happy about my life at the moment.",25Apr2019,1
153,"I grew up im a very southern Baptist environment that made me really judgmental, just in general as the way I see the world. I don't just observe things, I take a stance on everything. I dont meet people and get to know them, I meet them and I'm analyzing where I am with them in terms of attractiveness, position, financial status, it's like I'm judging whether I can feel confident around someone or not and since I have nothing going for me at the moment, everyone makes me uncomfortable. I'm less attractive, weaker, less wealthy, in a less important career, so I can't be confident or they'll put me down. I was bullied a lot growing up, so I tend to expect it from everyone, I judge everyone as untrustworthy and it makes it hard to be myself around them too. I judge myself as judgmental, obviously, and my sarcasm, dry tone, and naturally negative way of seeing things just makes it to where I'm basically bitching about something no matter what the context is. 

I hate all of this, I avoid people so as not to be like ""damn why am I such a dick"" all the time, even though no one else says that about me. It's all in my head now, can I change the way I think? It took years of being in various settings in life to make me this way, can I choose to do anything that would naturally reshape how I think, the way my personality came to be this way in the first place? What would I have to do? What setting would I need to be in? Or am I just stuck as this overly particular asshole who gets constantly annoyed at everything because he sees mostly that which he judges to be negative in his own eyes? And as was typical of the way I grew up, when I judge something to be bad, I want to improve it. I feel stressed if I don't, so I either stay stressed, or try to ""improve"" the situation, which usually means trying to change how someone else does (or doesn't) do something. 

And in the case of lazy roommates who dont do shit, maybe I'm not wrong to be annoyed, but being a dick about it improves nothing. Neither does stressfully doing all the work in the house. Coworkers half assing their work fucks everyone over, but what is accomplished by coming down on them with no result, especially if the boss is already on them for it with no improvement? Life is full of things I can't control, I don't want to be stressed about all of it, I can't change it. How can I change myself? It feels embedded so deep in who I am, I once believed so strongly that I was helping save peoples' very souls by trying to ""improve"" them, what could hold that much power now that I don't believe in that? I hate being this way but I dont know how to change. 

I'm perfectionist, nothing anyone else does is ever good enough, I have to fake appreciation for genuinely good intentions because they weren't done to the level I would have done it myself. So even if roommates do clean, it wasnt as good as if I did it, still annoyed because I feel like I need to do more to follow up or be annoyed when I see it, can't just turn my judgmental awareness of it off. Dating sucks, I could find someone I get along with alright if I wasn't so turned off by obesity..I mean that actually seems kinda natural, but today's culture is turning into all about how fat people are supposed to be beautiful, so I guess that makes me judgmental too, it's wrong to not be attracted to obesity anymore. I just feel like everything about how I think is wrong. I love offensive humor, but now that's ""edgy"" and admittedly, it relies on thinking of ways to make fun of people. It's all in joking fun, but everyome gets so offended anymore, even I'm getting a soft skin because no one makes jokes anymore, but everyone is quick to seriously attack something they disagree with.

I'll delete this pretty quickly I'm sure but thanks for any input. Tl;dr I'm judgmental and I don't wanna be, can I essentially be someone else?",25Apr2019,1

I've had just a general, constant feeling of anxiety, emptiness, and tiredness in varying degrees since I was around 14. I'm 22 now. Since then I've probably been to 6 or 7 different therapists/counselors, and I feel as though none of them have ever helped. I've had ones that tried to ""cure me"" of being gay, or tried to point that out as the cause of my unhappiness. I had one that wouldn't entertain the idea that I could have depression because I ""don't cry."" I've never really felt listened to as a patient and I just feel like therapy doesn't work, or at least rarely ever does. I have quite a few mentally ill relatives who have either committed or attempted suicide, became alcoholics, or just have never shown signs of getting any better.

Recently, my gf of 5 years broke up with me pretty much exclusively due to my emotional/mental issues. I really tried to put on a happy face for her for a long time, but everything would always eventually spill out and I would disappoint her. I know that the only way to fix things is to fix my mental state and see a therapist or the like, but it just doesn't seem like anything could help and it makes me feel hopeless. I would love to feel content or at least normal more than anything, but I just don't know how possible that is.

1. Memory loss(I can't remember a lot of my childhood)
2. Hearing voices?(like, not out loud kind of voices, it's kind of like...I think it's called your internal monologue but the difference is that it's not like....my thoughts? It's hard to explain)
3. Spacing out(probably not that serious)
4. Bad at keeping track of time/remembering what day/month it is(also probably not serious)
5. Mood changes somewhat frequently (i.e. I can be fine and then all of a sudden I'll be angry for whatever reason)
6. I've been told I've done things I don't remember doing(I was told by my mom)
7. Bad memory(I keep a journal of what I do to keep track of it just in case I forget)

158,"I just found out my new job offer I was supposed to start next week got revoked. Today has been nothing but a horrible reminder of everything I’ve failed in the last 27 years. I’ve fucked up my education, having spent 32k on something I cannot follow a career in. My credit is ruined and I’m beyond flat broke. My SO and I cannot afford a wedding despite wanting one for 2 years now, we are barely making major bills, we are unable to save at all. 
I cannot hold a full time job for the life of me. I have crippling, horrid social and otherwise anxiety and I freeze up every morning when it’s time to get dressed and drive over. My mind just starts spinning and I become so fearful and overly anxious that I just sit there, fully catatonic and unable to move just crying my eyes out and unable to actually get up and go there. As you can imagine, that leads me to missing a bunch of work for which I’ve been let go countless times. 
I feel like I’ve becoming a huge burden on my SO. Like the above mentioned, maintaining employment has been damn near impossible, but I’m a grown ass woman  who needs to be able to take care of her bills. Well, straight up, I cannot. While he pays for most of rent and car, he can’t afford the extra 6-7 hundred to cover my loans and medications. And it’s not his job or responsibility to, it’s mine for fucks sake. 
So here I am. Physically unable to get up and go to work, not that I have a job to go to anymore. 27 today, in more debt than I can handle, feeling guilt for relying on my SO all the time. He deserves so much better than me, my inability to work, my worthlessness and complete lack of future.

160,"So, I'm very new to this subreddit, but I've wanted to talk about this.

Some context to this story, I've recently been hospitalized and sent to a psych ward due to an failed suicide attempt. I was there for a month when the usual stay time is a single week. I've been depressed for 7 years and only have been decently officially be diagnosed with a severe case of major depression. Along with that I've also been diagnosed with something along the lines of PTSD but instead of one traumatic experience, I've experience several. Along with generalized anxiety. I'm finally getting help and taking medications to help.

So, I've been on an intensive out patient services. I have a consoler and a peer assigned to me, to help me take on the several years of depression, suppressed memories. Along with learning how to talk about what I'm going through or what I went through. So pretty much since I was young I've been very paranoid of the people around me and what happens. Starting off just as an insecurity spiraled into a trap I believe I never will get out of.  I expressed the scenario I've seem to built in my mind, how I really can never let anyone truly get close to me and know everything. Especially about my paranoia. I was terrified that I was letting a person know about it and what could happen by this. She tried to understand it, but I dont know how to describe things well. Though, it kinda felt good to that I told someone who'd I (kinda, I can never fully trust people) trusted.

For me this is a huge step forward in a LOOOOOOONG road to getting better and help I need.

I have recently started to close off again and I don't want to leave the house anymore at all. I don't like anything about me and I feel so alone in doing so. I know I have people to turn to but it's hard to say things to someone face. It's even harder to admit them to myself. Despite knowing I'm an average weight, its all I focus on and even though I know no-one cares, it still is a big part of deciding what I do in my life. I thought recently I had gotten this issue in my life sorted, I thought that last time aswell so I know its never going to go away, but I genuinely thought I'd fixed it on my own this time. I have finally managed to keep up a healthy eating schedule and I felt like as long as I kept working out I could do that. So i found comfort in that. Then, recently, I've become so tired. I can't sleep properly and I'm lucky if I get 4 hours a night. So my workout schedule has become incredibly lenient and I have no-one who's forcing me to do this so I just go sleep because I'm so tired. This has began to affect how I see myself and my weight and I've become incredibly paranoid about food again. I don't know what to do but sometimes I just want to run away from my own body, but that's sadly not possible. So I guess I'll have to find a way around this.
