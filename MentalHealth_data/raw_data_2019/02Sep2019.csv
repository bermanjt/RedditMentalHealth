0,"I (19 F) was at work today and I ended up getting in a long conversation while rolling silverware (I am a server) with my coworker who’s actually going to college for psych right now. We were talking and she wanted to “evaluate” me and asked me to talk about hard stuff that’s happened in my life. I couldn’t really think of anything that has ever bothered me enough to be “traumatic” to me. She asked about breakups, anyone who has hurt me in the past, deaths of family or friends, and I explained that yes i’ve experienced these but I don’t really care enough to call them tragedies or trauma. It’s all part of daily life. I told her the most difficult thing in my life is that I dislike my boyfriend whom I live with (he’s shitty but not really abusive or anything), and dislike almost every person that surrounds my daily life. I explained how I think all of our coworkers are boring idiots, I don’t really have any close friends, and once again, my boyfriend is just an idiot. I don’t feel admiration or a strong connection with anyone in my life and I didn’t realize that was so abnormal until this conversation today. I truly don’t care for company of other people, I am admittedly pretty selfish but it’s not like everyone else has my back or best interests at heart so why should I have theirs? None of this bothers me so much but I’m more curious now and i’m looking at sociopathic behaviors and Anti social personality disorder. I didn’t think that being disinterested in others and others lives was that abnormal. Does anyone have anymore information or insight on this? 

TLDR: A coworker told me I may have sociopathic tendencies and I am just curious for input, discussion, and more information.",02Sep2019,1
1,"I’m in my late teens, and for as long as I can remember, I’ve always wanted to stay as a child. I was often the youngest in groups and I loved it. Maybe it’s because it makes me feel special. I like attention.
I was never neglected or abused as a child. I had a wonderful childhood.
And now I wish I could go back to being a child, when everything (mostly schoolwork) was easy.
Because as an adult, it’s so hard to become good enough at anything to be worth something. I think most people are stupid, and I have high expectations for myself.
But I wish I could live in a world where nobody expected anything from me, and then I impressed them all.

But I know it’s impossible, so I at least want to be a decent adult worth something (mostly in terms of education - I want to get into a good college and perform well there).
But I hate people who are immature and love attention and want to be taken care of, like myself. I would never tell anyone about this part of myself.
I’m tired, and I don’t want to work hard.
I want to get rid of that disgusting part of me.

2,Hi there. I am 25 years old. I am a female and at this current time in my life I’m very tired out. I like to sleep a lot. I have been told that I need to find a second job by my husband which will tire me out more. I am extremely quiet at work and always seem to stay to myself if possible. I am a lab assistant and I work full time. I have no children or animals. I had animals at one time but kept getting rid of them. I was not good at taking care of animals. All due to feeling lazy all the time. It really is a struggle. All my life I have been to counseling and have been on and off medicine. I was diagnosed with anxiety and post traumatic stress disorder. I do not have any friends or much family I see. I was adopted at the age of 9 years old. I have met my biological parents a few times. They are in jail today as they have been in and out of jail for years now. I do not have friends due to just separating myself from people who I thought at one point had my best interest but as I got older or more “awakened” I started seeing the real picture. I am telling some of my life story so those who read this post can maybe have a little insight of how things have been for me. All of what I mentioned is just a small part of what I have been through. I have forgiven and moved on. Not sure why I am tired all the time. Has the past damaged me that much to where my brain just wants to sleep all the time? I know medicine made me feel sick and I did not like the feeling it gave. I cannot find this happiness and freedom you know? Any advice to better my life? I have tried reading and finding hobbies but I get bored after awhile. I almost feel like life is pointless,02Sep2019,1
3,"So, many people would look at my life and think I am good, hell 2 years ago I would have killed to be where I am at today.  But now that I am here all I see is pain and despair.

I am in a poly relationship, me being my partners secondary it leads me to feeling lonely.  I am socially awkward, multiple tramatic brain injuries has left me lacking in social ability face to face and I dont pick up on subtleties...either its said or I miss it.

My room mate is lonely, flirts like hell with me, knows i have a thing for her, and then when i start feeling like there is something there she pulls back.  She always apologizes but it just makes the loneliness sting worse.

As I heal from the traumas that I have, I am finding that my life and all I have known was abuse.  That I may have had issues back to childhood with aspergers but no one listened to me.  And now it has caused me to have some basic things about how people are to be wrong.  Like my idea of how people treat me I have been told is considered manipulation but to me it is just normal.

I am 35 and I feel like I dont know anything about being a human.  I feel like I belong more with the wild animals and creatures out in the woods.  At least there no one attempts to kill me, no one back stabs me, no one deserts me...",02Sep2019,1
4,"I live in San Francisco the city has been dealing with a very big problem with public defecation and all around horrible street sanitation.I bring this up because leaving home is stressful enough but I don't feel any better at home.I've been diagnosed with anxiety disorder and OCD they go hand in hand together and I have had numerous panic attacks and health issues because I've been stressed at home and away from it.I cannot leave my home a lot of the times and when I do its mostly going to places by car, rarely walking or by bus.I am stressed when walking and am paranoid of anything that associates with filth and contamination.Because of this I'm trapped at home, with 5 members of my family 3 of which argue, raise their voices,are aggressive, and get into fights a lot.I feel like the crazy one in my family and I have had major bouts of depression and suicidal thoughts and the city has done nothing to help even if I go to a doctor or therapist I've been thrown around to psychiatrists who seem to lack any kind of plan or structure to help me and I am so frustrated in life that I cannot find joy or relaxation, even if we go on vacation the vibe is so tense.I can't even relax,I feel like I'm living in a personal hell.I want to break down and just cry because I can't even live a normal day without potentially breaking down because my OCD prevents me from doing anything normally.",02Sep2019,1
5,"I work as a chef, and tonight a young guy who I've had trouble with before made a rude comment to me near the end of the shift.

I decided, because I'm normal for a 28 year old and not childish at all, that I was going to get secret revenge by dropping mayonnaise in his hair. I missed. He noticed. He sprayed me with sanitiser, I sprayed him back, he threatened to beat me up... uh, ""normal stuff""...

Later, in the changing room, I kind of apologised to him, saying that it was only meant to have been kitchen banter, and shouldn't have been taken so seriously. He took this in the spirit it was meant, and got in my face and threatened me again. I'm quite a bit taller than him, and he would have lost his job by acting on it, so I wasn't exactly frightened. I'm just so depressed by my actions and the whole stupid incident.

I shouldn't have done that in the first place. Now I feel like I can't go back to my work. What's wrong with me? I'm doing this job while I work on taking up a career in a responsible position, and I can't do that if I'm behaving like this.",02Sep2019,0
6,"I’m a 32 year old guy and I’ve felt abnormal since adolescence.  In school I began having intrusive thoughts that I hate certain people and that I was sexually abnormal because I experience no attraction to others. I’ve always faked being normal and clung to stronger people because I hated being me. As a person experiencing complete emotional emptiness I started using drugs late in my teens and that’s continued up until now.

I’ve done some therapy and been prescribed lots of antidepressants (I don’t even know if I’m depressed) and never got any relief from it. I’ve lost faith in the ability of professionals to treat me. Nowadays I just search google for psychiatric conditions in hopes something will click.  This is no way to live life and I feel like I will end up killing myself because I get no enjoyment from life.

8,"So,

 i've been aware of my mental issues for years now, i've actually go to a psychologist before, twice actually (i've always think that mental health should be treated just like regular health) 
But both those times i got sent to the psychologist by my parents, not really remeber their reasons, it was years ago.

Now i want to go on my own, i'm a 20 y/o male from Chile, i can go to therapy pretty much for free in my college.

The thing is, i dont know what to say once i'm there,because i think i have plenty of issues, not too heavy i guess because i can still notice them in my own mind, said issues are low self esteem, anxiety, depression, anger issues and a toxic relationship with my mom.  Again, these issues arent as bad as for other folks, mad respect for them that endure worse. 

I think i can trace most of my things from the low self esteem and anger issues, those can be the main deal here, so i think i could start there.


Anyone else that went/its going through something similar?

10,"(First of all I’m on mobile so if I screw up the formatting or spelling, that’s why.)


I find myself almost in a no-win situation. I have horrid anxiety even when talking to people that I know, and my job currently is to talk to and take note of everything strangers have to say when I can’t understand them all of the time and frequently have to ask them to repeat themselves multiple times. Because of stress-induced migraines I’ve had to call out of work, which has created interpersonal conflict (between being outright told I’m going to be fired, to other more passive-aggressive conflict). If I go into work I am plagued by stress, anxiety, and borderline condescension from other coworkers resulting in stress induced migraines and/or intestinal problems.

I’ve informed my doctor of my declining mental health and I do not believe it is currently possible to keep my job at the company I work, whilst receiving therapy for PTSD and GAD.

I live with my parents; my father thinks that any mental illness can just be fixed with a pill and going outside (which has worked for a lot of people, I’m not one of them), and almost always talks about me and my mental illness in a dejectory way, even though he doesn’t know the full extent of the trauma I’ve experienced. He has recently gone so far as to go into the doctor’s appointment with me (I’m 20) and mention putting me on even more medication than I am already taking. My doc offered a few new meds, my father said something snarky about me not wanting him to bring my mental health up, I close my eyes and for about 30 seconds I try to bring myself to say what I need to, and I finally asked my father to leave the room and, to not look bad in front of my doc, he does. I then build up the wherewithal to explain my situation to my very understanding doctor. I almost have an anxiety attack in the process, but I am able to explain to her what I am experiencing and how it is affecting my life. 

My conundrum is if I quit my job which would be best for my mental health (barring the fact that my sister also works there and is generally a toxic person) I don’t know how severely my father will react. However if I keep my job my mental and subsequently physical health will continue to decline.

I welcome all advice.


TLDR: Do quit my job to preserve what’s left of my mental health and go into therapy and risk further jeopardizing my relationship’s with my father and sister; or do I keep working in order to have a supplemental income and continue to have a declining mental and physical health?",02Sep2019,1

12,"My life is just a big piece of shit right now and I’m so beyond depressed idk what to do anymore. Growing up my life wasn’t terrible but it was not great. I wouldn’t even have time to talk about all the crazy shit that happened when I was a kid. I’ll save all that for another post. More recently, my life has been terrible the last few years. My mom unexpectedly passed away 3 years ago as of October 10th. She went to the hospital with pneumonia on a Saturday night and died on Monday morning. Sunday around 4am she was put in a medically induced coma as her lungs collapsed and by Monday morning her kidneys had failed and her heart failed. They attempted to bring her back once but they advised us she was brain dead so it was pointless to keep trying. She left behind my stepdad, 3 daughters (including me), a son, mother, and sister. My grandma became so depressed after her death she would not eat or leave her room. So bad to the point that she would fall often and need EMT assistance to get it up. That happened about 6 times until they admitted her to a nursing home. Now she’s been there for a little over 2 years and is completely immobile and dying of dementia. I know if my mom hadn’t passed she would not be like this. She’s still depressed and they have to force feed her sometimes. She was a bigger women and now she’s lost over 100 pounds. Sometimes when I visit she calls me my moms name and I obviously don’t tell her that my mom is dead and it kills me every time she thinks I’m her. My stepdad completely went off the rails. At first he was great and we would talk and hang out constantly. My brother is autistic and only 15 at the time so he still lived with him. Now my stepdad is a heroin addict and won’t talk to anyone and is living with some women in another city. Before that he got into a physical fight with my brother because my brother was threatening to call CPS as the water was turned off and he had no food. After the fight he moved in with my older sister. It hurts he doesn’t talk to me as me and him we’re the closest out of all of us. We had our own nicknames for each other and now he won’t talk to me and I haven’t seen/talked to him in months. I do talk to my dad a lot more now as he’s the only parent I have left. The only person that I am really close to is my aunt but sadly she lives in California and I New York so I see her maybe once a year. I’m the sole person who takes care of my grandmas bills and I now live in her home and pay her mortgage. Bill wise it’s overwhelming as the nursing home had taken all of her social security so it’s just me paying out of pocket for all of her stuff. I recently left a good paying job because of how stressed I was at work and at home. I just couldn’t handle it anymore. Now I work a shitty job until I find a better one. More recently I have been thinking of my mom and at least once a day I burst out crying but I keep it to myself. I won’t cry or talk to anyone about it. If I talk about it I cry and I just can’t cry in front of people. I hate being emotional in front of anyone. I have a fiancé of 6 years and honestly he’s the only reason I haven’t killed myself. I’ve been having suicidal thoughts lately (which I’ve always had since being a teenager) but lately it’s just been more often but the only reason I can’t do it is my fiancé. I love him more than anything and I know he loves me and if I died I know it would crush him and I don’t think he’d be able to handle it. If anyone actually read this whole
thing I appreciate it. I never talk about it often so sometimes I just wanna blurt it all out.",02Sep2019,2

15,"I have disorders that spread almost everywhere on the spectrum

I've been doing neurofeedback therapy for a couple of months. And it was effective within a minute of me first trying it. 

I can't really explain how it works but it involves electrodes being put on certain parts on your head depending on which area you want to affect, visual/auditory/physical stimulation. Example: watching a movie for auditory and visual stimulation, and holding a vibrating object. 
The screen flashes and gets bigger and smaller depending on how your brain is reacting, and the vibrating object vibrates at different frequencies and intervals, also depending on how your brain reacts. My therapist changes the frequency depending on how I feel. It helps with anxiety, depression, headaches, energy, etc. I sleep better and I feel better. 

It lasts longer the more times you do it, and it's given me days where I felt free from my fear, anxiety, depression, PTSD, etc. 

It's not magic, and it's not the perfect solution to all of my problems, but it's definitely a useful tool. And crazy how well and how fast it works.

I'd seriously suggest to everyone that they try it.",02Sep2019,1

19,"This is the first time I'm writing about something like this. I'm going into my third year of university, after the 4 months of summer break. I haven't done anything during these 4 months. I don't even know if I've enjoyed my time to be honest. All I did was stay in my room the whole day till 5pm on reddit/youtube and then go outside to meet up with some people from my neighborhood to smoke pot. I feel that this has been a distraction from the things that I should/want to be doing. 

Beginning of this summer I had some idea of what I wanted to do, but I didn't write down any goals or think of anything specific. I haven't made any friends in university which is obviously a bummer, so hanging out with friends wasn't really an option. But I thought maybe I could go to the gym, read, and maybe write more. I've thought about writing down funny ideas or jokes but I always find a reason not to. One day it's because my ideas suck, another day it's because I'm not smart enough or am not knowledgeable, another day it's because my writing and vocabulary suck, and recently I've just thought about how comedy as a whole is shit. I used to believe that making people laugh was my purpose but now I just think about how dumb it seems and how stand up comics are all shit. So at the end of the summer, I didn't end up doing any of the things I thought I'd want to do or should do. 

At the moment as I'm writing this, I don't feel really that sad about how my summer went. I feel mostly indifferent. Now I'm going into my third year of university. Studying computer science. I don't know if I like it because I haven't put much effort in my studies I feel. My gpa is a 3.3 which isn't terrible, but I just feel like I haven't learned shit and these next 2 years are just gonna be so boring. I haven't made any friends in my program because I can't relate to anyone who likes computer science. To be honest I don't even know why I'm typing this. I just feel like I haven't given much thought to my circumstances this summer. I've just been keeping myself distracted from my issues. 

I feel like this post hasn't been very cohesive so I'll just end it with what I think some of my issues are. I think my first issue is that I have no real friends to talk to. Some of my childhood friends are in my area, but I can hardly relate to them and they don't want to hear what I have to say which I completely understand. My parents are immigrants that I can hardly relate to. Plus they struggled hard to give the opportunities that I have, so my troubles are small compared to what they went through. Also I've convinced my dad that all my misery is due to school and difficulty. Finally I have no girlfriend and probably won't have one at least until my school ends. Second issue is that I overthink things. I can't enjoy something without thinking that it sucks. I can't set goals because I think of all the other things I could do or I think about whether I really want those goals. How can I know I want something if I haven't got it yet? Finally, the last big issue I think I have is that I daydream a lot. I daydream about being famous or having a girlfriend mostly. Not all my daydreams are happy though. I'll have daydreams about being unhappy in the future or being forever alone.

I just feel like I can't get out of this rut I'm in. I can't seem to change my mindset.",02Sep2019,1
20,"Trigger warning: Im only (f)14 which probably seems pretty young but in my opinion i had a very traumatic childhood. Im not saying its anything compared to some people but. My mom was an addict and has only recently gotten sober. My dad is still in act of addiction and tried to kill himself a while (a year or so) ago. He overdosed and my brother who is almost 21 now found him blue and almost dead. He had to give him cpr but i wasnt there. I was only at the hospital where my dad acted like it was fun. Continuously saying how he wanted to die and was disappointed. My brother is now in prison because he is also an addict. I cant tell if hes doing better or if hes just off of drugs. Because its not the same thing. About 10 months ago i cut myself. It went on for months until I realized summer was coming.  So i stopped because i didnt want people to see when i started practicing my sport. My mom noticed and told me to stop. Thats the only thing she said besides a couple days later, asking me why. Its almost an addiction for me. I want to do it again. Ive told my friends about my problems but all they seem to do is make it about them. And ive told family about it but all they do is ask why or act like its so simple. Like just stop acting depressed, if only it were that easy. I idid go to a Counselor but i didnt really open up everything. She didnt seem like the person who could understand. I was cutting while i went to her if that tells you anything. I feel like im bipolar but my family says im not. Of course they barely notice when i cry. I cried in public today trying to wipe my tears away and my mom just told me to wipe them away.  But i go through spells. I think i do anyway. And my sleep is up and down. But i feel like people will think its just because im a teenage girl or just because im on my period. Im suicidal too and have made up excuses not to kms. Like i got a tattoo and told myself that once i have it, im not aloud to kms. What i didnt realize was it wouldnt keep the thoughts away. So thats when i turned to cutting myself. And from that i went into spells of numbness. And my mom doesnt help anything. She has a horrible boyfriend who, in my opinion, only likes her for the sex. Which I literally heard them have last night. My mom has always done this. She did it when i was 5 among other ages. She thinks im stupid or something. Like i dont notice. Everytime i tell her i dont like her boyfriend, she says shes working on it. That’s literally makes want to punch someone. 

Anyway, now that ive painted the picture for you, (or some/most of it at least) please tell me what to do. My mom acts like its nothing and so does everyone else. So who do i talk to? I have other friends i havent told but i dont want to get let down again. And what do i do? Is it a mental illness? I have many symptoms of various illnesses but i dont know.",02Sep2019,10

I have learned that the only cure is coping and living with all of it, and in the last 1.5 years i've been mentally stable. I had already decided years ago that i want to change myself completely; i don't want to feel pity for myself, as i have my whole life. I'm always introverted, terrible at conversations, shy, nervous. I want to be confident and in control, however i fear that i wont be able to ever be who i want.

\* I have a terrible sleeping disorder, i cant be left alone with my thoughts at night, i genuinelly fear myself, and i cant relax. i very often end up distracting myself on the internet until the very early hours of the morning, until im very exhaustet and sleep till afternoon that i have to go to work. That leads to terrible timing for actual activities to do in life.

\* I'm not able to express myself emotionally, sometimes i even fear strong emotiong such as love and affection, especially towards the opposite sex. I don't know if what i fear is the emotions or being betrayed by them.

\* I have no sex drive when im out there. I have a masturbation addiction, i do it every day, but when im actually out there, i have no strong feeling of chasing women. Only when im home and alone. That has led to a sexual frustration, sometimes i even doubt my own sexual orientation. I know im not into men, but the lack of sex has led me to a bland state. When im out there on dates, i always fuck things up, i dont know what it is about me. Women like me, they go out with me, but when we are actually out there, i'm very empty and un motivated.

I had to drop out of high school in the tenth grade because  my social anxiety was so bad that I would get panic attacks when I saw a group of people. I spent a year recovering, putting myself in self-isolation in my bedroom so that I wouldn’t have any more panic attacks.

While this was happening, I started online schooling. In theory, it was a good idea. But the reality was that we could not afford any really fancy online schooling, so I was basically reading about a subject and taking a test, practically teaching myself. Though, without any  real-life friends to talk to or any contact with a human besides my mother period, I spiraled into an awful bedridden depression that basically made me say ‘screw school’ for a long while.

over the years, my anxiety got worse and worse, and the depression always came back as soon as it went away. I started taking more medicine to help (I was already taking some), but It never helped me long-term. 
I became scared to face my own family and the questions they would ask. I would always pretend I was fine, and they would never look to close to notice. 

My father, getting tired of the lack of progress, would always guilt me with passive remarks. My brother, who is an extremely social and outgoing person, would always try to help me only to get extremely frustrated when I would have to leave to go home when the anxiety became too much. I had to hide my depression from my mother, who I live with, because she would simply give me a frustrated look and tell me that ‘I’m not really feeling like that.’

Family became harder and harder to speak to, and it got to the point where I would start chugging beers whenever I was with family in order to get drunk, so that it was easier to talk.
It would make me feel disgusted with myself, but I was more disgusted at the fact I could not even speak to my own family without stuttering, shaking, and nearly being at tears without the help of alcohol.

I began to grow envious at my family, mainly my cousins. They are extremely wealthy and had never suffered like this. Why not them, and why me? Why can’t I just live like a normal person?
All this ended up doing was making me look at myself and realize how gross of a person I am.

eventually, at the current time, I started studying the ged. I got on an online program and started teaching myself all of the subjects required to pass the tests. I thought that maybe I could just go to college and see what happens with my life from there.

unfortunately, my anxiety and depression decided to hit me full force just when I was about to finish the writing portion.  Just the thought of going outside of my own house makes me have a panic attack. I cannot learn how to drive like this, I cannot get a job like this, I cannot gain any friends like this, and I am afraid I won’t even be able to pass the ged like this, the one thing that would make all of this just a bit better. 

All I have been doing lately is meagerly trying to study with no will to do so, and getting on my game console to talk to the few far-away friends that will listen. I am on multiple serious medications that do not seem to help, and I cannot turn to family for that help either. I really pushed myself and decided I would go to my father’s house this week (he lives an hour away) to get a sort of break away from the mundane, but I seriously do not have the drive to hide this depression anymore. I’ve had so many panic attacks lately that I would rather lay in a bed and sleep than have another one.

I really don’t know what to do, and this is more of a vent than anything. I just needed somewhere I could say this without feeling like everything I know is crushing me into the dirt.",02Sep2019,1

I’m a male in my early 20s, and since I was about 11-12 I’ve always done anal play. I’m not sure what sparked it, it’s just something I’ve always wanted. That doesn’t seem that weird on its own, but I’ve realized it’s a part of a few other things. My childhood has always been a hazy memory, and I’ve also never been one to remember dreams very well. I do remember one dream though, where I vaguely recall being raped by Moto Moto (Yes, a children’s cartoon hippo. I realize that sounds like a joke, it’s not) and it has always made me uncomfortable to think about.)

This is tough to talk about. I have an almost constant urge to take my clothes off and run around in public. The thoughts just won’t stop intruding. I have a great life, but I just can’t stop thinking about ruining it. I’m tired of being the good person that everyone thinks I am. I want to get naked, wag my dick at people, maybe take some drugs that might make it easier. I can be in sweet, emotional moments with family and friends, and these thoughts burst in and take over. Feels like a pounding pressure in my head. Doesn’t stop until I find somewhere to take my clothes off in private. I feel like I’m spiraling. In therapy, things seem to be going well, but then the urges get worse. Embarrassed to talk about how bad the urges are. I don’t know if I can keep this going. What’s even the point? Society’s probably going to fall apart in a few decades. Might as well get started early. I want to just tear my clothes off and start some chaos.

45,"I myself have come a very long way with my mental health recovery. As a teenager I had a couple 72 hour stays, I was very depressed and now as an adult I am on the other side more-or-less recovered. Sometimes I have my moments but I can work through them now. I've put in alot of work studying psychology and mental health, then also putting into action what I learned. Being an emotionally healthy person is a big thing in my life. 

 This post isn't in reguards to me but for someone I love very much. My fiancee has been battling depression but unlike me he doesn't seem to show much interest in improvement. I know first hand that you have to want to recover to start recovery. He has gone to a therapist for about 6 visits which didn't end up successful at all. He didn't think the work he was given would help. So he didnt even try the work and stopped going. Any time there is talk of him trying to get better he shuts it down. He wont even do a google search on his depression. His rebutle is always ""how am I suppose to fix what was cemented in me from childhood"" like there is no hope and he really isn't willing to try. At this point our relationship is dependent on him getting help. I believe his depression causes him to be mean and disrespectful to me frequently. He lacks empathy, and will say incredibly hurtful things to me. It's like he gets in these moods where he just gets vicious for no reason. (Quick example, my mom died of cancer, because of this i do my best to stay healthy. We got take out chinese and I asked him nicely to tell the reasturant to put my order in the cardbord take out boxes instead of the styrofoam. Because the styrofoam  always melts onto the food. He didn't  ask them to do this because maybe anxiety or something. So I told him, very calmly, why it's so important to me because clearly he didn't understand. He isn't psychic. So I was vulnerable and told him about my fear of dieing like my mom and he then proceeded tell me ""It doesn't even matter if you're eating chemicals, we live in America so you breathe in carcinogens all the time"" I was appauled and devastated that he could say something so vicious and evil over something like that. That was one of the first moments I realised that our realtionship was in jeopardy) The worst part is when we sit down to discuss his behavior he wont face it. Im not a condemning person, i don't yell, I don't disrespect him. Everytime we have a serious conversation I am being vulnerable with the intent to gain understanding for both parties and the goal is to fix the problem. Any time I tell him that he did something that was hurtful and try to establish a boundary,  he tries to spin it around on me and bring up something totally unrelated in order to not address what he did. We can never fix our problems because he can't handle looking at his flaws. Which is also why he wont go get help or take it seriously.  There is alot of toxic shame in him, which is something he needs to work on but never does. He definitely has some type of depression, I would wager that he has anxiety too.  He made it very clear that he hates life, himself and he isn't happy. He himself will admit to depression. His last therapist was kind of a hack. She told him that him and I should have a baby so that he has something to concentrate on, which is such a bad idea on so many levels. She never diagnosed him with anything or referred him to psychiatry. So we don't have a clear diagnosis.  He might need medication and we wouldn't know because he wont find  a new therapist to go to. 

Im not sure if anyone here was ever really resistant to seeking help, but I would love some advice on how to begin to over come this. When I was depressed I wanted nothing more then to be happy again. So I don't understand why he doesn't want to be healthy. If he doesn't get help I have to leave him, because I am worth so much more then constantly being disrespected and emotionally attacked. I have a plan, I can stay with family who will help me with the separation. I really don't want to leave him because I can empathize and I understand what it is like to be at the bottom of the depression hole and I want to see him over come it. I really do love him and have already given so much of myself in trying to help him and support him but I am not a professional. Our relationship exhausts me and I am giving up my mental health to supprt him. There are days when his words cut deep and he hurts my feelings so badly that it then triggers my depression. Which I then have to deal with relatively alone, because he as my partner isnt in a position to be kind, caring, empathetic or sensitive. Any advice is helpful here. Any advice you can give him and me as well would be great.",02Sep2019,1

51,"I was misdiagnosed with Asperger's, recently discovered that my mom intentionally doctor shopped the diagnosis for me (she found my initial attachment disorders caused neglect to be insulting- which turned out to be right and agreeing with in my two re-evaluations as an adult).

I was wongly put in special education that recieved extra funding for children in it which means I wasn't removed from the system until 16 years old. And due to many difficulties from my family I didn't get my correct diagnosis until 21.

While it provides some closure, long term inappropriate diagnosis and treatment caused me to be isolated from normal children kind of life, and traumatizes me further than just dysfunctional home life and... Not so nice.. parents. - misdiagnosis can actually harm a child.


However it seems like if you mention misdiagnosis, overdiagnosis or any mention of someone who doesn't have autism on autism related subreddits, or places like Wrongplanet. People seem to dismiss it as illegitimate. A lot of autistic people on those community seem to get defensive and doubt people who questioned if their own diagnosis is wrong. Or say some stock phrases like ""Autism is a spectrum you don't have to have every symptoms"". They seem to have this ""autism is always correct"" mindset that doesn't exist in other mental health communities.


To me this is very disheartening to see, it makes me feel like my experiences are not real. I do understand that a lot of autistic people have a hard time getting a diagnosis and being questioned when they're high functioning but it doesn't mean that a reverse can't be true

In the early 2000s i feel like it was the time where autism or asperger's diagnosis was an easy shortcut for behavioral problems. While these are now refined, we don't really talk about the damage done to misidentified child.

53,"Well I guess we better just start from the beginning so you might get a clear-ish picture of my situation. 

Early childhood (age around 7) was tumultuous. Lots of fights, send other kids to the emergency room for bullying. So I jumped on his head repeatedly. This obviously got the government/CPS connected, and I had to deal with that for a while. Other things I used to do was when I was upset for something, I would hit my head. Once I ran into a kitchen wall with my head first in the middle of getting yelled at. 

Teenage years. More fights, more disobedience, bad grades, expelled twice etc. It was around this time my mother got fed up and started making me go to psychiatists. I got two diagnoses. ADHD (Type 1), and Oppositional defiant disorder.  
At around 17 I got the crap kicked out of me, which according to my psychiatrists gave me some PTSD symptoms. Such as if a potential fight was about to break out I would get panic attacks as to before I never used to. It was about this time I started screwing around with drugs. Not in any major amount, but enough. Also was put on Concerta.

Joined the navy, had a couple of  breakdowns during my service but nothing that prevented me from completing my service with passing grades.   
After that I started working security, which really started messing up my head. Lots of broken people in horrible life situations every night. Coworkers getting their faces kicked in, etc. This was when I started realising that I was getting panic attacks every time I met one of the local junkies, and I had to tell him off or something.   
Worked in security for a couple of years, until I broke down and quit. 

0 drugs except alcohol during this time. 

After the stint in security I went back to the military and quit later after 4 months, due to me breaking down. Again. 

It was after the army that I started to go to psychiatrists by myself. It took them 2 years before I would start getting any kind of therapy. They diagnosed me with Social Anxiety, and Depression. They also put me through a bunch of Autism tests and ADHD tests.   
So they just prescribed some light anti anxiety medication, and SSRI's which I never used. They also tried to get me to eat Concerta as I was when I was 16-17, but I still haven't decided if I want to take them as I am scared of either getting addicted or dying from them. I don't like taking pills. 

Last year they put me on a 24 hour psych hold for driving to the psych emergency, with 0.3 alcohol. Got really bad anxiety from drinking too heavily the night before, and I didn't know what the hell to do. 

So now to avoid getting put on a psych hold I have been lying to my psychiatrist for about 6 months now, and it's getting harder and harder to not talk about the things that bother me. As of now, they are treating me for social anxiety, and before we started that we went through dealing with my health anxiety. I usually just hide my emotions by smoking pot. Alot of pot. I rarely drink when I smoke so atleast I got that going for me. -.-

This latest ""stint"" of feeling like crap started about 1 month ago when I resigned from my job (again), for psychiatric reasons. After I quit, I told myself that nothing matters and I might aswell smoke until I get a psychosis and I finally have the balls to kms. Obviously that failed.  
The closest I got was getting hallucinations, seeing red balls bouncing on the bus, moving curtains, flashes of light and seeing shapes/shadows of people. Mainly in the woods. Is it something to be concerned about?  


What am I supposed to do now? As of now I am just going through the motions waiting to die.  Can't get a full time job, and if I did I would just break down like before.

58,"#  THE STORY

**(because people are not reasons, it is not their fault, never has been and never will be, that's my and only my plan)**

**1.M**

He said that I'm worth the difficulties. He said ""let's be friends forever"", ""no matter what"". He was one of my favourite ""things"" to be alive. Once real difficulties occured he got sick of me so much. He said that he'd tell me if he wanted me to be gone from his life. He even didn't do this. If even he started to hate me, then I must be really horrible. It is so surreal that he actually doesn't care about me anymore. I lost faith in friendship.  
***I understand that I had troubles with giving space.*** I didn't want to feel like an unwanted ghost. But yup, my bad.  
I didn't want him to have a girlfriend with vaginismus.

**2.L**

He said all these cool things about me. He was such a great friend. But he also changed his mind about me. At the end because of my suicidial talking he showed how much he hates me. He has been through a lot. He lost 4 people to suicide. I thought that he shouldn't be calling people who are suicidial as ""manipulative"". He said that I lack understanding and empathy. It's actually the opposite. I understand both sides. And I don't want him to lose anyone else to this. I just thought that he shouldn't be approaching suicidial people like that. At the end he told me to fuck right off and to leave him alone. To be honest, this makes me wanna kill myself more. I still respect him. I should have been selfish, like he said I was.  
***I know that he's been very patient with me.*** I still respect him and I still think that he's a great person.

**3.Vaginismus**

I die inside little by little everyday because of this.  
When I saw physical therapist, for the 1st time, we tried something. It was slightly embarassing but I was okay with this. Everything in clothes and not a big deal. And yet I was shaking and I wasn't able to control it. She also told me that I need therapy 1st.  
Well, therapist was able to SEE how I ""handle"" vaginismus  
When I saw the gynecologist for the 2nd time with my blood test results, she didn't want to try to examine me because I was already freaking out before going to her office.

I was actually diagnosed with this because I went to gynecologist for the 1st time in my life. M wants to have kids. Me? That's messy. I was told that he'd change his mind about being with me and I believed in this. So I went to the gynecologist to also check if I can actually have kids as my period has always been messy but I was too afraid to do anything about this.  
If I wanted to force him into anything, I wouldn't go to this terrifying place. It was also supposed to be something good for me.

Now I know that I am terrified of giving birth and I have a problem with calling myself a mother. That's after talking to a therapist about it too. I have a problem with being a woman. Maybe because I feel hated and useless?

This diagnosis has affected me deeply. I don't think about it much but I can feel its presence everyday.

***It's like living in a haunted house.***

I wish I didn't go there.

**4.Understanding**

Well, okay. L was quite right with saying that I lack understanding. I have some troubles with understanding social stuff. I think that I lack experience. Or it is just because of anxiety and the fact that my mind is really messed up. Or ***I*** ***ask too many questions, to understand BETTER***. OR all of this. They take it as my total lack of understanding.

I was also looking for some understanding from them. Found none. I didn't want to force anyone into anything. I wanted to be understood. At least a little.

**5.Empathy**

L is wrong. I actually have too much empathy. Once they accused me of something and even if my reaction to this was ""wtf?"", I think about these accusations and probably subconsciously agree with them. ***Because If I made them feel this way, I must have done something wrong.***  
I lack communication skills. I was trying to find some advices on how to communicate better.  
Then they started to call me manipulative. I just ruin everything.

**6.Jealousy over M's colleague**

Did I act stupid few times over jealousy. Indeed I had. Did A called it ""blatantly jealous""? She had. M unfrotunately has spoken to her about it.

We met again. 1st evening I left my phone away. He was on his phone all the time. I must say I was a little hurt. I went to the balcony, he joined me too. But he was on his phone all the time. I was thinking about going on a walk. Just the two of us. But he was just staring at his phone. We slept in the same bed, it wasn't just this once. Nothing happened but to me that's already very intimate. I wanted to hold his hand but I was a coward.  
Next day he gave me his phone HIMSELF, to check something. Soon after, he very defensively asked me to give it back. There were more similiar situations.  
One evening we watched the big bang theory and young sheldon. It was just me and him, finally. I wanted to hug him but I was thinking about the girl he keeps talking to.  
At the end I hugged him. Twice. It was the best feeling in the world. I wanted to do it for the 3rd time but I thought that this is the end.  
When we got back home, he wanted more hugs. Really MORE HUGS.  
But then he just started cutting me out. I was actually thinking that I am probably wrong about this. I finally told him about my feelings. I was trying to find out 1st if I should. But M didn't want to be honest with me. ***I was so confused.***  
All of that obviously didn't happen over just 1 week.

Took me a while to realise that it wasn't really jealousy. I was angry that he played with my feelings. But I don't know how to get angry at people.

**7.A**

Oh my. I cannot believe that I dislike somebody this much.

I did act bad towards her ONCE at the beginning and then 2-3 times more. Yes. MY BAD. But one day, I did tell her that I am sorry. I promised to myself to be nice to her. And I have done it. I have been nothing but nice to her. Even when she was bullying me: ""It's all your fault!"". ***It wasn't easy to be nice to her, to be honest.***

**8.Jealousy over A**

I have never in my life felt so replaced. I used to feel worse than her because of my vaginismus. It is obviously only my fault. It hurt as fuck seeing him becoming closer and closer with her and pushing me away more and more.

This might be the main reason of lost friendships. ***It doesn't suprise me that vaginismus is directly involved with this.***

**9.The conflict: I love you and you don't want me, M. What do we do?**

I started to feel so alone in this conflict very fast. I just need too much. I know. I can't chill. I talk too much under stress. I vent too much (seen reddit?)  
M was saying NOTHING most of the time.  
Once I even scared myself when I did something: I joined a group voice call and started asking M if he still wants to be friends with me. I know. I am horrible.  
I wasn't supposed to talk to him. But I was thinking that if I cannot handle being his friend when he gets a girlfriend, then I just HAVE TO talk to him about this. For his own good. Maybe he'd want to finish this friendship right away. Why should I stay around and then leave him? ***I couldn't have done it to him.***  
I really didn't want to be that kind of friend.

**10.Stalking**

For some time, not all the time but it happened many times, I was checking if they were playing stupid league of legends and staying in private calls. I was looking for proof of them wanting me to be gone. ***I felt this unwanted.*** But I knew that my anxiety has been telling me many things. I stopped when M told me that he feels being stalked.

**11.Anxiety**

***Is so high that I can feel it, constantly.***  
Even endocrynologist told me that I am a very nervous person

**12**.**Hate**

***I HATE MYSELF***

**13**.**Asking if M has a girlfriend yet**

I have done it so many times. I was afraid that that was the reason why he constantly felt so distant or that's why he isn't being friends with me anymore. My bad, I know. It was very stupid of me. But remember that time (kinda more than once) when he didn't want to be honest with me, to not to hurt me? ***I was constantly afraid that it was happening over and over again.*** I was stupid, I know.

59,"Do you ever feel dissociated with only PART of your body? I do... From the top of my forehead down to the middle of my ribs I am dissociated from my right side. That chunk of my body feels like it isn't mine, like it belonged to somebody else and was sewn onto me as part of some sick experiment. What's worse is my right arm feels like it has its own desires, regardless of what I'm doing or how I'm feeling. This wouldn't be an issue... If the desires weren't to finger paint with blood and dig my hand inside someone. I don't want to, that isn't me, but it's a strong urge that courses through my arm and it's so distracting.

I usually am sort of DJ during parties. Guests pick ""mood"" of a songs they want to hear and I play like 5 songs matching it. I am really careful with the music (films also) and carefully select the music in my playlist. Don't get me wrong, I do listen to a lot of music but add only the songs I wanna hear 2nd and more times. It's mainly rap but also some pop, electro, rock etc to spice it a bit up. Most of the times I am able to pick songs from this playlist but not today. We were playing cards and smoking hookah with friends and I was asked to play a ""happy"" songs. Just happy mood. Not so difficult, right? Eh... Wrong. I was not able to find a single song in my playlist I was creating almost over a year or may be even close to 2. That hit hard man.

68,"Okay so some background history on me, I turned 20 in June, I’ve had bad anxiety since I was 9/10. Been through it rough since I was 14 with my eating disorder, depression, self harm, psychosis etc. 
when I was in adolescences I had state insurance (KS) so the hospital I went to for my meds they were all in school and I saw someone new every couple months. 

Growing up meds never seemed to help my depression or anxiety. The depression has seen to of gotten better with age. But the psychosis itself just seems to happen to me on its own schedule and timing. But here recently it’s been getting pretty bad &amp; intense for me. 

I just don’t know if it is the right option for me seeing as nothing helped in the last. I was on &amp; off more meds than I can remember neither count between new drs and in &amp; out of children’s psychiatric hospital. So I wanted to see others input. But I haven’t taken meds much after I turned 18, very off and on with when I would want to be in meds and not. Being on so many different ones and nothing helping makes me very skeptical if there are any meds to help my mental illnesses anymore 

My problem lately has been visual hallucinations that last a lot longer, they are happening s lot more often than usual, and randomly. I’ve been struggling to gain weight but I’ve been recovered for the past 5 years as of this past June. I guess I’m at a loss as to what to do. I’m sure if I got to my dr again she will want to do meds, as they all seem to and I’ve never had one do much for me, unless it upset my stomach lol.",02Sep2019,2

Now I'm at the age where people younger than me are having families, buying cars and houses, working on their career, and I'm still doing fuckall, being depressed, anxious, staring into exactly the same screen for 11 years. I didn't even bother to buy a new monitor.

Why do I need a career, besides for food and rent? For my non-existent hobbies, non-existent SO, or my non-existent children? It's like, okay Darwin, you got me. Why can't society accept that I'm a failure and should be removed from the system?",02Sep2019,6

73,"Hi there, 

As the title says I'm exploring options to start seeing a therapist and/or career counselor. In all honesty I probably could have benefitted from therapy for the past couple years, but I was always pretty overwhelmed by other things going on in my life and never had time to look into it. Well, I was laid off from my last job back in January, and I can only describe the ensuing several months as being stuck in some sort of mental/emotional coma, where I was just sort of floating through life and doing the bare minimum to get by. Over the past few days I feel like I've finally snapped out of it and am trying to get my life back on track. My professional life has absolutely not gone the way I thought it would, and I realize I'm incredibly angry and bitter about it. 

I'm going to start the process of searching for a therapist to talk through my feelings, but one of the reasons I've hesitated is because I'm not even really sure exactly how I should start. Like, do I just start telling my story? The process of how therapy works seems very nebulous to me so I'm looking for advice on how to get the most out of these sessions.",02Sep2019,2

75,"I'm a 30 year old male. I spend most of my time alone, not by choice but maybe, but a mix of anxiety and not knowing how to talk to people. Maybe lack of confidence, but certainly, that I've never had a role model. And considering I never really can relate to other guys, or appreciate the harshness of bullshit, or even care... I usually only have brief intense relationships with women...which of course, blow up at some point.

I can count on one hand the number of times I've been invited out with others, to lunch or otherwise, this is in 30 years of life. I've only been to 2 movies with groups..in my entire life, and one of those was with a therapy group. 

I've spent years living in 3rd world countries where no one speaks English. Cheap enough to just get by on my savings, but that's coming to a close end, and mostly rely on google translate, yes even with relationships, but mostly do nothing..read, sit in a cafe, try to stay awake, entire day. 

I never liked living in the US, maybe because I was also always alone there, combined with anxiety, and always too 'sensitive' or 'immature' or 'lazy' (had depression since I was a child, and every treatment you can think of, including ECT, which ruined my memory for life)

My family has lots of mental health issues, my dad is probably narcissistic, and my mom seems borderline and overly empathetic, ..to which I think I'm borderline as well, which explains intense relationships and having a favorite person for so many years, along with splitting. I'm inadvertently good at becoming helpless in a relationship, but that usually doesn't work out, being a male. 

I  dont have the funds or resources to move back to the US, nor any desire, I dont have 'contacts' or connections in my industry of work, and I dont seem to have any motivation to work in it either. Actually I dont really have any friends at all in the US, and could care less about going back. 

I had a major splitting episode lately, after my 3rd ..fling if you will blew in in the past couple months. I fell hard for someone with mental issues a few months back...except the roles became harshly reversed after the beginning, and she was always constantly in a crisis, after a while she ghosted and I snapped, moved across the country to an extremely isolated place. 

I've spent most of my days alone, at a cafe or in bed. Mostly more so in bed now, as I lost motivation for the gym, and realize caffeine is fucking with me.   Anyways, after getting extremely ill, and spending all my time in bed, now I've come to a harsh conclusion. I'm just waiting to die. I'm not even THAT depressed as I've been in the past. I'm just numb, to everything. I dont feel anything. I seek out sex all the time to fill some void/addiction, but beyond that, nothing makes me want to get up in the morning, at all.

I've thought it's always been lack of fulfilling relationships, and general mistrust towards people, as I seem to get burned a lot. I did a lot of therapy in uni, to try to overcome social anxiety, but didnt get far, back then. Now I just dont even have a desire to have the same bullshit boring unfulling conversations with people. Not even being in my language anymore.

I dont seem creative enough to ever create a reason to talk to others, expats for example, I just generally have unfulfilling interactions and avoid them.

I could probably write about my analysis of my fucked up family and how it's affected me, all day, but not sure there's a point. I just really want to figure out what friendship is. Normal people seem to invite each other to things, and the few times I try to get male friends, they end up being gay and attracted to me. One time would be like an 'oops', but this has happened many many times, to the point I just get paranoid to get close or have any male friendships, whatever that is.

On the other hand, I probably cant have a platonic female relationship as a result of this extreme thinking. Maybe one in the past few years, but she likes me, and I realized the relationship was only built on my venting to her, she was my favorite person in bpd terms.",02Sep2019,2
76,"My Dad growing up would go into depressive slumps and rages quite regularly. He medicated himself with alcohol and marijuana until around two years ago when he was prescribed anti-depressants.

He doesn't think about the consequences of anything anymore, racking up thousands on debt on stupid things.

He also doesn't understand other peoples perspectives anymore, and has lost his ability to detect sarcasm which is the strangest symptom.

79,"this morning a family member accused me of ruining my own day by not getting out of bed early. I told her nicely not to text me aggressively or text me things about people I didn’t like, because I saw those texts first thing in the morning. My brain was already cluttered because of weird convoluted dreams I had been having and I was already finding it hard to get out of bed. I tried to defend myself saying that my day wasn’t ruined because I got out of bed late, it was because she sent me those texts. and I was so desperate and frustrated that she wasn’t understanding me that I blurted out that I have depression and anxiety and that’s why I can’t get out easily. my voice was breaking at that point. all she said was “the same accusations as your ___other family member____” and “stop crying on an auspicious day okay. God look at you crying today of all days.” I just didn’t know what to say, I took my sandwich into my room and sat on my bed, trying to process what had just happened. But in fact I’m not surprised I had that reaction. I think my body had been preparing for that inapathetic response because I was just numbly trying to realize that the only family member I was depending on had basically prioritized other things over my feelings and mental health. I don’t think I’m over the shock of realising that she said that. I shouldn’t have expected anything else. I feel extremely embarrassed for confiding something so personal to me, for it not to be taken seriously. I guess if anyone else asks me about it I need to deny that I said anything like that.

An hour later I went to bathe and pray and now I’m on my bed. I don’t know what to do and the whole house seems even more unsafe. I want to get out. I can’t believe that that was her response. It’s completely turned our relationship on its head and I don’t know how to deal with this sudden shift. Everything seems very unsafe and I don’t know how to deal with not being able to trust her anymore. A huge part of my daily life revolved around her and now I don’t even feel safe around her.

just now, i went to the supermarket to buy some things to cook with tomorrow. if anything food makes me happy. then i get a call from another family member, and he's yelling at me, asking me what's wrong with me and why i didn't tell the previous family member that i was going out. i couldn't say anything, but by then i lost all drive to cook and felt like i didn't deserve to feel happy. so i went to return all the things to the proper shelves and bought only a bottle of juice which i planned to have for dinner.

86,"a few years ago i was taking melatonin. stopped working properly because i frequently used it with alcohol. switched to twin labs melatonin. drink the twin labs mel with pepsi/gatorade frequently. eventually i cant even drink soda or gatorade anymore. i cant sleep if i do. at all. i drank 2 powerades a month later and my brain was fried for over a year. getting shit sleep constantly, completely death of my personality, a living hell. i notice if i eat or drink certain things, sometimes its bad, sometimes not, but i get a dose of what i experienced after those powerades. if i restrict myself to drinking and eating certain things i can get by, sleep, but the moment i eat anything with certain preservatives or anything a switch flips in my head and i feel like shit/dont want to talk to anyone. its a living hell and i work in a restaurant so you can see how that fucks with me. i dont know if this will ever change because it has been going on for 3 years. i feel like im going insane because i lived 23 years without this problem. im about to go the fuck off and i need help or shits going to get real bad. i've had enough of this shit.

if you are going to reply ""its all in your head"" just dont bother. i want help from someone who knows a thing or two about this problem. i am completely fucking miserable.",02Sep2019,1

88,"Im concerned about my husbands mental health he is currently on antidepressants that he doesn't bother to take regular he had a gastric bypass in january and our son was born in april. We also moved home in late april so a lot happened in a short time. The concern I have is about his compulsive lying, he has always told lies from the day i met him (we have been together 7 years) the lies seemed to be little lies to make himself sound better. He would make himself out to be better then he is, but then his lies got more regular when he spoke to other people I would notice he would stretch the truth or flat out lie. He would do this to twist any situation to his favour, if he got caught out he would just dig a bigger hole and rarely admitted he was lying.  Now he told me when we first got together he had an older sister who his family basically disowned because she dated a guy his family didn't approve of. He told me she was living in america with this guy and they had kids,he told me not to mention it to his family as it was a sore subject. I was at his parents house last week and his mom got out the photo albums I noticed there was not one picture of his sister in these albums. I questioned him on our drive home about this and he said she moved out before he was born. That would mean his mom gave birth at 10 years old if this was true so i knew it was a lie. I told him I would ask his mom and he came clean he has no sister and never had one. I asked him why he continued this lie for 7 years and he said he dug a hole but couldn't explain why he lied in the first place. I am conflicted I feel I cannot trust him anymore and from what I have read compulsive lying cant be fixed or cured.This is a huge thing to lie about for so long and he wasn't gong to come clean until I threatened to ask his mom. He has also always been controlling in the sense that if he doesn't want me to do something he wont tell me no, but he will manipulate me until he gets a desired outcome. He is not necessarily a bad guy but he is very entitled and he expects to get what he wants when he wants. I am starting to think he might have a narcissistic personality or a personality disorder and I am worried the effect this may have on our son growing up, any advice or information on these conditions is welcomed as I have no idea how to continue with this situation.

TLDR.. My husband convinced me for our whole relationship he had a sister that never existed I am now concerned about his mental health.",02Sep2019,1
89,"I always loved to sing. As young as four it was so undeniable my mother put me in serious lessons when I was only five. I started doing vocal competitions and theater around then and later mom put porcelain fillings in exclusively and braces when it was time so people wouldn't be distracted from my vocals by my teeth.

I was known as the girl who sings by a alot of people for years and to be honest  my singing was one of the only things I've ever liked about myself or felt any pride in. No one can predict or control the twists and turns that come in life though. Especially when your talking about mental illness. It can just derail every plan, starve every potential and hope to death until everything that you defined yourself by before, like artist or singer is replaced by apathy, misery and a scary diagnosis. 

I took lessons untill 16 but my life had drastically changed way before I quit and it is a testament to just how good it feels to belt out a song that I kept on as long as I did. I held on to my song in numerous treatment centers around soCal, through years of abuse,and even though I never went to normal school again and i had whiplash and PTSD from how fast every single thing in my life changed, through complete meltdowns, overdoses and involuntary holds.
I was still that girl. 

Still mental illness and the trauma of treating it eroded my passions into interests and finally into apathy. I was too sick to care and I don't blame myself because it was out of my control but when I look back on the potential and talent I once had I  can't help but be fucking furious! I really could have had a happy, stable, fulfilled, and independent life. I could be a real accomplished and educated adult person which is sadly so not me.

Still out of all that was lost I can still carry a note and it still feels fantastic. sure my throat is tight, range is very limited and of course extremely out of practice. except for singing along to my headphones during smoke sessions I  literally haven't sang for years but I retained enough muscle memory to practice and improve and I've decided to sign up for private lessons again. This time is just for me though. I won't be in a prestigious music program or sing for the president ever and I don't give a fuck. I learned I loved to sing for real in my darkest hours when it gave me catharsis, release, joy and that incredible rush you get from feeling this wave of energy fly out of you and hit the ceiling! It helped keep me alive. So I'm taking my voice back from the grasp of my mental illness because it truly brings me joy and feeling that joy is a miracle for me in itself. 
I just wanted to say I'm so excited to unexpectedly be excited about something! I'm going to get my voice back!",02Sep2019,7

92,"I have depression, ptsd, and generalized anxiety. My anxiety isn’t actually generalized though. I know exactly what brings me anxiety. I’ve just been too embarrassed and frightened to admit it to my therapist (or anyone else). Being open about my thoughts and feelings has always been a struggle for me. I’m aware that I have to change this. That I have to be more open with at least one person if my life is ever going to improve. 

The other night I decided to open up to my friend. We were already on the topic of abusive relationships. I.e. A close friend of his is in an abusive relationship and he doesn’t understand why she doesn’t leave him. He said jokingly something along the lines of: “Only white girls would stay with a piece of shit man.” I corrected his statement (kindly) by saying that I was in an abusive relationship for 6 years (10 if you include the stalking). I’m not white… I told him that if he wants to help his friend, he should just be there for her. Leaving an abusive relationship is never easy, especially since the closest person she probably has in her life is her abuser. 

He still had a hard time wrapping his head around her situation. I know now that I shouldn’t have, but I decided to open up to him at this moment. I thought that if I told him a bit more about myself, that he would understand his other friend better… I eventually told him that one of the reasons I struggled to move on (beyond the threats and the fear)… I wanted to find meaning in my relationship. I come from a religious background, so I had this belief at the time that everything happens for a reason. That my abuser was in my life for a reason. In a way, this kind of correlates with my ptsd. That my brain is trying to find meaning and patterns in chaos. I told him that one of the things that helped ease my mind in the long run was to accept the chaos. This was hard to do in the beginning, because I had to confront this void... 

My friend's response... He essentially told me that I was weak... He told me that my outlook was bad. He said that if he were in my situation things would be different. That he is more positive than I am. He questioned the validity of my experiences. He told me that my experiences weren't as bad I believe them to be. Then he told me that I come across as deceptive, because I'm ""too open"" about my feelings and I make things sound worse than they actually are. ""It's all in your mind.""

I told him that my biggest problem is that I'm not open enough. I bottle everything up and it just ruminates in my head. I've known him for over ten years and he didn't know about hardly any of what I told him... 

I'm not mad at my friend... I'm just incredibly disappointed. I feel so embarrassed and foolish.",02Sep2019,2
93,"First of all a very sincere thank you for reading this.

This has been bothering me for a significant while.

I was depressed for 5 years (suicidal for 2). But fortunately I was able to overcome this completely and thus achieved my long time goal. In the year 2018 i made + received 13 phone calls and didn't meet a single friend. In the preceding years as well it was more or less the same. Now, as i have a very regular lifestyle with a healthy social component, I meet and talk to and go out with a lot of friends and do all this fun stuff. But even when i was depressed, I never felt lonely. And even now, i go on for multiple weeks without any contact with anybody but still feel not lonely. One of my very close and trustworthy friends also validated/verified this belief of mine ( that this is normal ) by saying that i was kinda off in this respect and don't resond/react to many things in similar ways he and my other friends do. This comment wasn't meant to be hurtful and i 100 percent see his point

So my question are 1. Is this valid ? 2. Do i need to be worried and look into solving what's causing this ?

So I started seeing a psychiatrist when I was 24 during medical school in Illinois, my final RX was taking an Adderall 30MG XR with a 15MG Adderall IR in the morning and another 15 mg IR in the late afternoon (not before 4 pm) if necessary. Since I moved to California to try and find a new provider, my patient history and previous regimen has  been met with much dismay and Ive been presented alternatives that just are not working ( a trial of max dosage SNRI *450mg welbutrin, then a trial of focalin 25mg). Im not sure what to do, as I am dependent on this medication for work and board exams. was the dosage that I was taking before considered ""too much?"", I was also told by an NP at a clinic I recently visited that XR adderall are being discontinued, any truth to this? FYI my most recent visit was going to a ""wellness"" clinic and the NP said the max dosage they can prescribe is 40MG, so i was prescribed 60 count of 20MG IR adderall... and it is just not working and I have no idea what to do.

thanks for your help anyone with advice if i should continue to find a psych that will prescribe or even contemplating taking a cheap flight back to Chicago to see my old psychiatrist.

96,"⚠️Trigger warning: mentions suicide⚠️
I have kept this to myself for so long, but I just wanted to share my knowledge of the subject. I have ROGD (Rapid-Onset Gender Dysphoria) which is a type of gender dysphoria that can develop after being sexually abused/assaulted while developing, having Autism Spectrum Disorder, having PTSD, having BPD, being bullied for being gay, having difficulty accepting homosexual feelings, discomfort in a developing body, body dismorphic disorder, etc. Not a lot of people know about this because it’s not very common and it’s only been discovered in the past few years. It also has had a bunch of backlash from news outlets, like buzzfeed, saying that it’s not a real thing and that the doctors that diagnose children with this dysphoria are trying to convince trans children to not be trans. I just wanted to speak up about this and say that that is not true. This is my story:
Ever since I was a little girl, I had been somewhat of a tomboy. I loved skirts, playing barbies, and dressing up in Christmas dresses every year. I would also love wearing my older brother’s hand-me-down clothes, sword fighting with my friends (all were boys), rolling in the dirt, and playing legos with my brothers. I was a bit of mix, but when my grandmother died I started developing PTSD from the trauma. I started gravitating towards more tomboy stuff and I didn’t feel very comfortable in my own skin. I didn’t feel gender dysphoria until I was 16, after I was sexually abused by my boyfriend at the time. It was like as if something snapped in me, and I no longer wanted to be a woman. I hated my breasts and I longed to see a flat chest and male genitalia. I would often wear the same clothes for days so that I wouldn’t have to see my body. I asked people to call me Andi instead of my birth name. I genuinely felt gender dysphoria. I also didn’t remember a lot about my childhood because of the PTSD, so I didn’t remember that I didn’t feel like this when I was younger. I was like this for about a year before I was in the hospital after another suicide attempt, and they diagnosed me with ptsd. I was put into an outpatient program, where the psychologist there diagnosed me with ROGD caused by PTSD. After I was put on medication and started going to group therapy, I started feeling less and less dysphoric about my body and being a woman. I didn’t have any dresses, so once I started feeling confident enough I bought myself a dress. You wouldn’t believe how incredible it felt to feel beautiful again! I could look at myself in the mirror and not feel so incredibly uncomfortable. I started the long journey of emdr therapy at 20, and now I’m almost 23. My ptsd is gone, my depression is in recession, and I am fully comfortable with being a woman. I’m so glad and relieved that I didn’t start transitioning( when I desperately wanted to) and instead got the help that I really needed.
Before I go, I just wanted to put an emphasis on the fact that I never felt pressure to not identify as a man. I came to that conclusion on my own. My therapist and my psychiatrist were very supportive of me and called me by male pronouns, even though they knew that I wasn’t transgender. My parents tried to be as supportive as they could, but they knew that I wasn’t trans so it was hard for them. I never once felt pressure to identify as a woman.

103,"This whole dump is essentially the chronological order of me noticing things.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a family history of mental illness. I have family members that have schizophrenia, ocd, bipolar, and narcissism. I have bipolar 2. I am currently on 200 mg lamotrigine. The lamotrigine makes my memory pretty crap. Because of this I'm not entirely sure of some of the situations I'm going to describe. I may be mixing a dreams with memories, or overlapping memories. I am also an alcoholic.

&amp;#x200B;

I have not discussed any of this with my doctor, because I am afraid that I'll oversell it and get a false diagnosis. I've done my best to be completely honest and accurate, but all of this has occurred over a \~6 month time period and, as I said, my memory is pretty garbage.

&amp;#x200B;

I began growing concerned when I started getting paranoid in traffic. I would spot someone in my mirror and believe that they were stalking me or about to road rage. I had no reason to believe this, other than that they were following a bit too closely or talking to someone in the car. After a few times I realized how nonsensical it was to have these paranoid beliefs and made an effort to stop. This still occurs, and sometimes causes me a lot of stress, but I'm usually able to ignore it.

&amp;#x200B;

Around the time that my traffic paranoia began, I started noticing that I was assigning meaning to coincidences. The ground is soggy + more centipedes than usual = something ambiguously bad that is my fault and centered around me. It wasn't ever anything concrete, just a feeling that two things put together must have meaning. Again, I realized that I was being dumb and managed to successfully ignore the problem until it mostly went away. It still occasionally happens, but I dismiss it as soon as it does.

&amp;#x200B;

Now comes the big turning point where I started thinking that this might be something serious, instead of just run of the mill anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

I got drunk one night in an attempt to calm myself down so I could go to sleep. I was having very bad anxiety at the time, though I don't remember what caused it. I successfully went to sleep. About two hours later I wake up with a panic attack. I think I'm having a heart attack, drenched in cold sweat, hyperventilating, and all that good stuff. I flailed around a bit and managed to calm down slightly. I then noticed that there were amorphous shadows standing around my bed, touching me with long thorny fingers. I started panicking again, decided I was about to die-either by heart attack or whatever the shadows would do-and accepted death. After a while of pure terror, I realized that I was hallucinating.

&amp;#x200B;

I did my best to go back to sleep, but every time I closed my eyes I would see a mosaic of neon faces decomposing and silently screaming at me. I nearly fell asleep a few times, but every time I almost drifted off the panic attack would jolt me back awake. Eventually I just got so exhausted that I powered through the panic to pass out.

&amp;#x200B;

The next day it really just seemed like a bad dream, but I was very concerned about it. I wound up not calling my doctor or anything after some research seemed to indicate it was just something that sometimes happened to people, not an indicator of mental illness. However, for the next day or two, I felt like I was seeing figures in the dark, mostly a human shape standing behind my closet door. I figured that they weren't real and just a hangover from the night of the hallucination.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then, I think I've occasionally seen shadows flickering in the corner of my vision when I enter a room, like something just ran out of the light to hide from me. I say I think because I'm honestly not sure if I'm just psyching myself out or it's just a dream that got muddled into a memory.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I think I've started hearing things that are not real. Again, I can't be sure because there's nothing as extreme as full on voices. It's mostly people laughing at me. For example, I was purchasing beer at the store on Friday when a man also buying beer stepped in line behind me. I was not looking directly at him, but as he put his beer onto the conveyor belt, I heard somebody in his direction quickly laugh. When I looked over I saw that his expression was very flat and disinterested. There was also nobody else in line. It is possible that he did laugh, but his demeanor and expression did not make it seem like he did. I wanted to ask him if he laughed, but decided it'd be rude.

&amp;#x200B;

Another example, I was in a store with my mother. She was talking to me and I thought I herd her say ""cuntfuck"" in the middle of a sentence. I asked her to repeat the sentence and she did, this time I did not hear the phrase. There was nothing in the sentence that would sound like that phrase, but it's still possible that I misheard.

&amp;#x200B;

Some more rapid fire examples: I hear my cat scratching at the door even though I see her sitting in her bed next to me. I heard something that sounded like a horse quickly run through the first floor of the house when I was on the second floor, nobody else heard it. I faintly hear sirens, but don't see any ambulances. Someone walks past me and makes a comment about how I look or laughs at me, I look back and they don't seem to have said anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, everything I've been hearing is more than likely happening and I'm misinterpreting it, but I can never confirm because the source is always outside of or just on the edge of my field of view. I also don't want to start accosting strangers over every noise I hear. I believe that it is also possibly just a result of a recent resurgence of anxiety. I could absolutely be bamboozling myself into imagining stuff or being paranoid about nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

The plan is at four and all day I have felt nothing but dread and loss as if my day has been stolen from me. I stare at the time while rolling around in my bed. With each minute that passes, I find myself automatically doing the math of how much time needs to pass until I have to get ready. Three hours and thirty two minutes, two hours  eighteen minutes and currently an hour and twenty three minutes. I do this with everything from work to appointments, to casual plans with acquaintances. Every single day to the point where I don’t know what I’d even want to do anymore. During my highs, I feel ashamed to have squandered so much of my time and I tell myself I will be better the next day. Yet, my eyes open every morning to the shadow of a towering commitment in the shape of “work at 3” It is an issue that is slowly draining me of my joy in life.

My question is: Is this normal? How do I not feel like everything is a hurdle or stain on my day? How does everyone else... live?",02Sep2019,1
112,"For context, I work in a big box store with an equally big backroom, so as a result we use walkies to communicate. Nobody is designated to work there so it's just whenever you need to go.

I was at work yesterday in the backroom working on the items that came on the truck that day. I'm usually back there for about 2 hours because I have to fold things that are very time consuming and cannot be done on the salesfloor. (not a rule but there's just no where to do it.) I would listen to a podcast to give myself some background noise but I wanted some time to myself to think and whatnot.

During these 2 hours, the walkie is pretty active with people communicating and so on. Everyone's voice sounds different over the walkie but I can usually tell who it is if I'm familiar with them.

Now comes the thing I can't explain. It could be the silence back there and my mind playing tricks on me, but I've had weird things happening for the past couple months. Whatever, back on track.

I heard my HR person announce that my department's section designations were up. (so and so in this area. another so and so in this one.) It's almost time for my break anyway so I head up to look at it, except there was nothing written and nothing had been erased. Okay, weird. I ask my coworkers. They had no idea what I was talking about. Ask HR person, he seems annoyed as to why I would think that seeing as he's HR, not a leader in my department.

I'm pretty shaken up because it was his voice + exactly his voice as if coming over a walkie. I worry my store is trying to mess with me, but I'd rather not think about that and just try to get through the rest of my shift.

Maybe I'm obsessing over this and it's nothing but I know what I heard.

(It could have been him saying truck was done, but I got there 2 hours prior and the team that unloads the truck were nowhere to be seen and people had already gotten stuff for their area.)

I'm sorry for the book but I can't find an explanation anywhere. Only answer is to ask my psych when I see her in a couple weeks.",02Sep2019,2

I wish I could just leave. Make it look like I just wanted to live another life so that the people that I would leave behind didn't have to deal with my body or my funeral or anything else that comes with someone close to you taking their own life. I wan't the to think that I am happy somewhere and not to be sad about my death. I know it sounds weird but I feel like it would hurt less that way.

I am a failure. I don't want to go into too much detail but in general everything I do goes wrong and I am a burden for the people I love. I don't want to live anymore but if I would just kill myself I would still be a burden. I wish I could just be some nameless corpse. With a tombstone that has nothing on it. No one would have to worry. Just an odd thing that happened and now everyone can move on with their own lifes.

I know it’s policy and that he would have to if I told him, but I can’t bare the thought of her knowing.

It’s not the type of thing where I don’t want her to know because it would hurt her, I don’t want her knowing out of fear of what she might do. When she found out I was self harming, she was given instructions to not talk about it with me from my school and doctors. Got home and went to my room, 5 minutes later she started trying to knock my door down screaming and shouting out of anger saying that my life was perfect and there’s no need for me to do something so stupid like that, I had to barricade the door and it’s a small space from the end of my bed to the door, I was so cramped and hurt my spine. I left the first chance I could I slept somewhere else. There’s little communication between us, and she always complains and gets angry at me when we do talk, and she blames me for her depression because of the traumatic event I went through. I’m scared of what she’d do.

I want to get better and tell my therapist everything, but I can’t deal with her knowing, especially since she’s part of the reason why I actually need therapy. Any advice?",02Sep2019,3

I am a licensed therapist and have worked with Emetophobia for many years now. I use the best methods to treat it.

I thought it would be helpful to demonstrate what many pay hundreds of dollars to learn.

Emetophobia is a phobia that causes overwhelming, intense anxiety pertaining to vomiting. This is seen as a subset of OCD. With this intense anxiety, individuals need to know what they can do to relieve symptoms and the fear.

This is what you are going to learn in 3 simple stages.

However today at work I literally lost all ability to cope and physically and emotionally broke down. My feet were swollen and icky feeling with pins and needles, and was having crying episodes.

129,"So my dad has had OCD my entire life that has gone untreated and generally ignored by everyone as it was not super noticeable and didn’t really inhibit him in a major way. Everyone knows this about him but it’s not something that has ever been discussed especially with him. 

Within the last year and especially the last 6 months it has become entirely unmanageable. He is barely eating and has become very very thin bordering gaunt (I believe this is from fear of contamination, he covers his food with plastic wrap and lifts up the corner to eat when he does eat), he washes his hands excessively and has started hiding all the towels he uses for it, he avoids touching anyone in family in any way, when he feeds our dogs it takes over an hour as he counts the food on their plates repeatedly. Attitude wise he has totally withdrawn and is very irritable, I can really see he is suffering and it’s very sad.  My parents are divorced so my sister and I feel we need to try and help the situation as there is no one else in his life who is close enough to him. We also do not live at home but have been spending more time there to monitor things. 

Overall my sister and I are very worried about him and unsure how to approach him as none of us have officially acknowledged that he has OCD (it’s never been diagnosed but from general online research I believe this is what he has). I want him to seek help but I am generally uninformed as to what the best option would be for him. I have seen options for therapy, medication, treatment programs etc. I am also not sure how it would be best to approach him about it.

131,"There is so much to unpack that I don't know where to start, and I will try to keep things brief. I am bipolar 1 with psychotic episodes and I plan to lie about the new episodes when I go back to the psychiatrist. 

I stopped working almost 2 years ago because my job was killing me (literally, as I had 1 suicide attempt). I used to go to work and literally do nothing; stare at my screen as long as I could before I'd get caught. Since I don't work, I promised I'd be productive; get fit, keep the house clean, try out an Etsy shop for my polymer clay figures, etc. Yet here I am, staring at my screen all day long as if I still worked. My husband makes all of the money, and while we're doing fine I feel like a trash person who's just a burden. He goes out of his way to show me he loves me, but I just don't get it.

My dad is dying. I drove 3 hours to see him after he's been in and out of the hospital. I stayed a week only to learn that he might be deciding to stop dialysis, which would leave him less than a month to live. My mom told me none of this, and I didn't even know he'd been in the hospital all these times. I want to drive back during each week, but my car really belongs to my parent and my mom was so broke she had to wait to pay the taxes, and I'm scared to drive without the tax sticker on my car. 

I just got on a new anti psychotic that I absolutely hate, but I'm going to pretend it is fine just so my psychiatrist doesn't put me on a worse one (we've been through a lot of them, and the ones left have terrible side effects).

I am feeling defeated. I feel like my mental health issues are winning. I am playing strong every time I see my parents, but I lose it when I get home. My husband says ""you don't have to be strong when you're home,"" but he also suffers from depression, and I feel like I shouldn't put him through that. It's hard for him too.

136," I have been going through a rough patch for the last few months so I did a bit more introspection and isolated the three main issues I would like to tackle.

Please note these issues have persisted for a long period of time, it is not something new related to my, rougher than usual, patch.

1. Extremely limited interest in anything, especially pleasurable activities  


Example: The movie ""IT chapter 2"" will start playing soon and it sounds like a good idea to see it, but if I do not, for any reason (work, lack of company, just being lazy etc.) I will feel absolutely no regret about it. Nothing. Seeing it or not seeing it basically leaves me feeling the same. Similar can be applied to many other ""should be exciting"" aspects of life like travel, money, relationships.

2. Always caring too much about the others and trying to solve their problems often completely neglecting my feelings and complicating my personal situation.

Example: I want to watch the movie IT chapter 2 and will totally adapt to my friends' schedule or wishes (which day of the week, 3D or not, which cinema etc.) no matter how difficult it might be for me. Also, I am able to enjoy the movie much less if my company does not enjoy it. This is particularly true about food (lunch/dinner) or travel where my level of satisfaction directly corresponds to my company's. 

3. My memory seems to be weak

Example: After seeing IT chapter 2 I expect to forget it very soon and be almost able to watch it again, as a new movie, in a month or two. This makes me wonder what is the purpose of pleasurable experiences (if those even exist) if I will forget them so quickly (probably directly connected to 1.). I thought about doing a written or photo journal, but don't have the discipline. I have noticed that some of the photos or items can jog my memory about the certain event, but, without this additional impulse, it would be almost impossible to remember.

First and the second points are a priority since I ended up in so many bad situations because of them.

I am totally open to talk to a therapist, but many of my family/friends are taking some sort of medicine so starting to wonder if that might be the way (never took anything in my life).

Any type of advice is more than welcome and thank you all in advance for your help.",02Sep2019,1

Constant daydreaming and spacing out are a brutal affliction I have to deal with most of the day, it's to the point where I have to actively keep a mental note to stay ""grounded"" so I don't wander off. It's such an issue that ill forget many things such as most of what people just said, things im doing ( such as I forgot which is the brake &amp; which is the accelerator while driving the other day and panicked for a second before bringing myself back). 

My biggest concern is that I've been viewing myself ""from the inside"" meaning, I feel like a backseat driver with the car in autopilot. I can pull myself out of it but it just seems like I retreat back asap if im not keeping track of it.

I wish I could sharpen my mind in a sense so I could stay grounded like everyone else but it a struggle I deal with all the time.

But from what I've looked up there's not too much to be done necessarily except anti-depressants, and while I may be a bit Apathetic, I'm not depressed. So that wouldn't seem to help either.

142,"Tale of my mind

Eh, how should I start this? Lets start by saying Hello. I am 18 years old boy from \*\*\*\*\*\*\*  and I'm gonna tell you my story of life.

I should start this from the very beginning, haha. I was normal baby, nothing diseases or anything else. I grew up in good family, mother and father were my childhood superstars and brothers my bodyguards. Of course I gotta say something about my cousins too, because they were often playing with me and made my childhood wonderful.

But now starts the first time of going to school. Lots of new faces. I wondered what kind of people would they be? Would they bully me? Would I be friends with them? Well I said to myself ""Don't worry, act normal and make friends."" that was what I did. I made lot of good friends at elementary school. Some of them are my friends till this day. But yeah, Elementary school was easy and It was pretty funny to me to be honest.. But I had bad behavior. Teachers would shout to me and I started thinking in my mind ""are these humans, is this what being human is?"". That's when this aura of hate touched me. I hated humans. Why would teachers shout to lot younger children? Well It was just a start of my mind.

Start of secondary school. Summer went by really fast with friends. But next morning it is gonna be first day at secondary school. Damn I was nervous. I thought things again inside of me. Will I see my first love? Will I get into fight? Lots of questions in this young mind. I woke up and went to school by bus. I was really nervous at bus. I'm now gonna see many, many new faces. Suddenly bus stopped and there I was. In front of secondary school. I saw my old friends and went there where they were. ""CLASS A"" Teacher yelled. My class was A. I went there and there I was, in middle of random such mysterious faces. That's where this young mans tale really began.

Secondary school was hell for me. Hard to make new friends since I was lonely boy. Till the day someone messaged me: ""Hey \*\*\*\*\*, come outside lets play football"". That's when I made friends. It was amazing to have such cool people as friends. And then I met friends of friends. That's how it works. But yet later, some of them were start of my anger against humans.

My own friends started bullying me by saying me Idiot, clown, retard whatever they could make up. I didn't do anything about it. I just let them do what they wanted. Everything left scar to me. That scar is still burning inside of me till this day and I haven't found a cure to it. This is gonna be first time, I'm gonna tell about this scar.

I always was lonely. I felt much better when I was alone. I think that other humans aren't on my level. They would be playing/hanging out and then there's me, being on computer almost all of the time. Good lord I was on computers all day long. One day I was on voice call with my internet friends and suddenly man joined there. He called himself ""Rikki"", ""Happo"". It was a bit random and I started to bully him like: ""Who the fuck you think you are, get the fuck out here."" Rikki or the guy said ""Why are you like that? What have I done to YOU?"" That's when I stopped. Why in the hell did I do that? Rikki said don't be sorry that's just being young and impulsive. I started talking with Rikki and man, he had to be most intelligent human I've ever heard of. I talked a lot of things with him. Such as mysteries of this planet, humanity and everything else. Rikki asked one question and I had to answer. What do you think is worlds biggest mystery? I answered something like D.B Cooper mystery or something like that. Rikki said he thinks biggest mystery is Human mind. I thought about it and said yeah your'e right. ""Sometime you learn about human mind by experience and by reading, see ya."" And he left.

Human mind. Worlds biggest mystery? Absolutely yes. From that day I started to think about it. Started writing notes, was seeking information on internet. Why humans are like this? They always just think about themselves. Then I got into section ""Serial killers"". They all had rough childhood and most of them were claimed PSYCHOPATHS. What the f was Psychopath, I was wondering. For 3 years till this day I have been searching about this. So there are serial killers and they are psychopaths? Is psychopath some sort of title to murderer? Why some of serial killers are very intelligence? I'm still seeking answer to this question till this day... Then I come up with my own theory.

Serial killers and psychopaths. People often say some are born as psychopaths. No that's not it. Would some serial killers be this day geniuses? Absolutely yes. What did drive them to do such things?. Now I'm gonna tell you the theory. Children born and has good/bad family. This children is much more smarter than other childs of same age. Of course this children who's more smarter, has different things he does wan't to talk about. Other childs wont understand whats hes saying, and they see him as clown, idiot and crazy. That leaves SCAR on him. A burning rage against humanity. This bullying wont end till they he has job and has to  leave the other childs behind. But scar is already inside of him sadly. You can't fix human mind. Now this children is gonna get revenge and that's why they end up being serial killers. Would Ted Bundy or Edmund Kemper be this day geniuses, if they weren't bullied or had better parents? What I'm thinking, yes. Absolutely they would be. Sadly its too late because of humans.

I made this theory and that's when the anger came also inside of me. Filthy humans.. I was so mad to all other humans. Everything you have said/done to me has affected me In some way. And here I am, Young man with crazy mind. You won't even believe whats going inside of my mind sometimes. But remember, all of this is because of other HUMANS.

I have been suffering for 3 years of this. And when people say something cruel to me, that's just boosts my anger against humans. I have never cried tho about the things in my mind. I'm actually proud of them. I would love to kill somebody of my ""bullies"" or ""friends"". Torture em and say look here I am now, this is what YOU made me to be, are you fucking proud now? And then he/she is dead. And I would show no signs of empathy to these humans. People often call me stupid and idiot, because my sense of humor is crazy and things sometimes. But actually that's part of my plan.

Mind manipulating. That's what I call true art. See how stupid humans are. I'm going to reveal my trick of manipulating. First I act as goof/Stupid when I see someone first time. So they get this feeling that ""oh man this guy is stupid."" now they would never expect what I'm capable of. I've always said mind manipulating is like chess game. Takes high IQ to make right moves at right time. That's how mind manipulating works. Right words, right emotions and right acts. People won't even realize that our friendship that has been going for 6-12 months is actually only part of my plan. You will never know whats going inside of me. Humans believe what they see, but man, you would be scared to death to see whats going inside of my mind.

I'm just gonna admit it straight away. Every night I do think about something. That is murdering people. Planning murders. I can't even stop it. Its like my mind saying ""hey now its the time to plan"" and I'm planning it. Planning how would I torture someone, where, when, why, what would I leave as sign, and WHO would I kill? I've planned lots of these on paper, but never accomplished any of them. Why? Because I think humanity needs this type of mind. I'm still here to help you, even tho I hate you from bottom of my heart forever. You can't repair human mind when its already broken...

This was my story. I'm trying to get help for my crazy mind nowadays, but we'll see what time is gonna show. I would love to tell a lot of more, but this was written in 1 hour. So there is lot of grammar problems and problems in the story itself. But hopefully you get catch on it. I wanna thank everybody, about what information/experience they gave to me. Thank you and Sorry.

\-18 years old boy with broken and crazy mind.

143,"Hi everyone !
sorry this might be long &amp; im on mobile.
 i’ve always considered myself a relatively happy person, had a few struggles through my teenage years but overcame everything . at  19 yrs i was hospitalized with a serious illness that was extremely painful and eye opening. This lead me to get out of a serious but unhealthy relationship that i was in from 17-20. my illness really changed me in the sense that i DO NOT take my health or anything i have for granted .  I realized how quick everything could be taken away from me
with this mindset I made a lot of progress in my life , had a lot of new hobbies , and after a year of being single met my current partner. He is amazing and we have a wonderful relationship based on a ton of respect for another. 
my life is absolutely perfect in every way i could have hoped for myself. 
how ever, i recently started to struggle with anxiety more intensely 
it’s seriously based on only two things:
1. my health. i constantly think i have a serious illness that needs treatment ( internet doesn’t help:/) i’m afraid soon this will drive away my partner as i constantly have to be seen by doctors and it turns out being nothing . 
2. i am terrified , i mean terrified of someone breaking into my house at night. the fear completely comes over me the second it gets dark. i know it’s unreasonable as i live in a safe neighborhood and we draw little attention to ourselves / have no valuables . but i can not get over this fear for months. it effects my sleep as i can’t stay by  myself without being petrified . i have no past experiences that would contribute to this fear! 

it’s truly ONLY these worries and it’s getting worse. don’t know what to do, and i really do not want to use any medications . i feel like part of this is i’m scared of losing my “ perfect life” ... but it’s not perfect , i can’t live in fear like this anymore ...
Am I losing it ?? help:(",02Sep2019,2
144,"I'm not enjoying life as i should be. I'm an 18 year old and just started College. But i'm an awkward person and i don't feel comfortable in my own mind. Never had a boyfriend and i'm shit at making friends. Some friends i have had turned out to be harmful.

I take Prozac for Anxiety but have decreased the dose. I have been to therapy years ago, but they treated me like a child who was scared of monsters

I don't feel excited, determined or passionate about things anymore and i don't feel like i'm living my life or have ever lived my life. 

I also feel like people will view me as an attention seeker and i'm scared of coming across as mental or needy or insecure when i'm not. I just want to understand and not feel alone.

I'm always hyperaware of my thoughts and about the fact that i'm thinking and feeling. It's like when you are manually breathing and are focused on your breathing. It's liks being trapped in your own mind.

I've had family issues in the past, involving nearly being evicted, a drunk dad (Who has now turned into a good man) and my mum recently going through severe Depression/Depersonalisation. I wonder if these factors as well as living with Anxiety my whole life have had an impact on my mental health. At the same time, my mum suffered on and off with mental health issues, she said it could be hereditery.

I did suffer for a while, but i got better and happier, but my mum becoming ill again made my anxiety return. She is better now but feel like I cant talk to her about my own issues.

What i'm asking is, does anyone else know what i mean? Feeling lost, alone and bored most of the time? Will it get easier again? Will i be myself again ? (Sometimes i'm not sure what that is)

Thanks for taking the time to read ♡♡",02Sep2019,11
145,"I wasn’t sure where else to post this but I thought this subreddit might fit.

I have a problem with jealousy and its really not good for my relationships with people and mental health. I have noticed it only occurs when I have developed feelings for someone, and I sometimes use it as a tool to tell if I actually have a crush on someone or not lmao. But basically, if someone I’m prone to get very jealous/possessive of talks to someone other than me it makes me very depressed and angry. It’s so bad that if I witness them having literally any interaction with anyone other than me it affects me for the rest of the day. It’s a problem.

I don’t want to deal with this any longer for obvious reasons but I don’t know how to stop it. If anyone has gone through this or knows how I can get better, could you give me some advice?",02Sep2019,3

I feel like graduating this semester, or going to therapy, doesn’t make a difference. There is no point of my life. I am not happy. Ill never be the successful person I use to be. I think it’s better to kill myself than kill someone else. I think it’s better to take my one life than to truly not live at all.

Pertinents - Mid 30s male - diagnosed with ADHD recently, as an adult, have suffered from dysthymia for most of adult life.  A bit of side effect anxiety which has been attributed to the ADHD and depression.   Taking prozac and adderal for this.

Problem - Muted emotions, very low highs, very high lows (if that makes sense) I don't get excited for example.  Overall emotional state ranges from can't get out of own way (very rarely these days) to just a level headed feeling. Rarely is there much beyond those 2 feelings.  Very scatterbrained, forgetful and unable to complete most projects unless obligated to do so (ADHD ftw?).  Socially I am able to be friendly with people with little effort involved and have over the years begun to feel comfortable with small talk.  On the other hand, extreme difficulty getting past the acquaintance phase with people (all people).  This leads to the intimacy and relationships issue.  I find it extremely difficult to build relationships at all.  I was completely devoid of effort in highschool and did not associate with my classmates in, or out of school so this is likely a leading contributor to my current social woes (I was not bullied, just, antisocial?).  In life this has lead to 1 short term relationship and 2 brief terms of dating, all 3 of which I was pursued by the girl and 2 of the 3 I just kind of.... fell out of touch with.

There was no bullying or abuse in childhood.  Performed well in school (honors up until 10th grade) outside of participating in extracurricular and doing homework / projects.  Was never in trouble outside of the aforementioned not doing homework and being late to school.

&amp;#x200B;

So a bit of a backstory.  

&amp;#x200B;

In highschool I avoided social interaction and just kind of minded my own business and went through the motions.  I was involved in no social circles, after school activities and sports and attended no school functions.  All by choice.  There were a handful of people I had known from elementary school that I did associate with, which by senior year was down to 1 person.   By the time I graduated, I was already working full time and building new working relationships.  However nothing translated to my personal life.  I was very passive (to an extent still am) and avoided any and all out of work social interaction probably until around 24.  At this point I started to put myself out there more.  Built a few solid friendships which lasted.  As of now there is still 4 or 5 people I would count as a friend and 1 very close friend.  I began to try to pursue intimate relationships but failed wildly for several years...

&amp;#x200B;

Intimate relationship life -  I was w/o a date until 26 years of age.  Not one (not ashamed, just a point).  I was pursued by a girl and we dated for about 8 months actually.  It went mostly well, but we grew apart and shared too few interests for it to last.  After that I had a friend hook me up with their friend at 28 which lasted a couple of months, again just grew apart.  And since that point have had several 1 off dates and only 1 other short term relationship which lasted all of a month and a half.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I don't feel as though I have difficulty meeting people, or being friendly, outgoing.  My main issue is the muted emotions and avoidance of most physical and emotional intimacy until knowing a person for quite an extended time.  My first relationship, she knew me about 1 year before pursuing and it took a solid 2+ months of dating for any sort of physical contact to happen outside of a hug.  It feels almost difficult to touch or share emotion, similar for instance to when you are a child and are doing something you know you are not supposed to do.   It has now been well over 6 years since last 2nd date and has been over 10 years since being in an official ""relationship"".  

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to approach this subject in a way that would be helpful.  It's not as if I haven't attempted over the years to build relationships (both platonic and intimate) and it is not as though I am a shy person, as I am not.   When brought up in the past in therapy, it was basically just said, put yourself out there more, you get used to it.   Which I don't disagree with, however, things have not changed in well over 10 years of putting myself out there and I am beginning to think there is some underlying situation I am not recognizing.

Any ideas oh great cyber world?",02Sep2019,4
149,"So for the past 4 years, I've been suffering from an undiagnosed illness. It affects almost every aspect of my life and has prevented me from moving forward. 

Up until 7 months ago, where I essentially said ""fuck it"" and went full force at life to spite my ill-health  (this was the fourth time I'd done this). It was going pretty good, I was cycling 35 miles a day, working 35hrs a week, money was coming in and I once again felt happy. I ended up chatting to an old female friend, we got together and it was amazing. But soon (4 weeks into new job), my health caught up with me, this started with just not being able to cycle to work, to not being able to hack a full day and ultimately to me not being able to attend for weeks and losing my job. 

This was utterly devastating as I'd lost my way out. Assuming my new girlfriend would be lost too. But she didn't. She stuck by me, even through the tears and moodiness. This really strengthened my love for her and we moved in soon after (too soon, but it felt right and made sense). I had landed another job (despite still not being 100% healthwise) and all was going well. Until about 5 weeks in, when my health took a rapid decline. This once again, resulted in job loss. ""This is it"" I thought, I've lost my new job, house, girlfriend etc. But nope, I reluctantly signed on for welfare and my girlfriend continued to stand by me. 

It still took it's toll on me mentally. To which I allowed myself to feel the hurt, I dont like to bottle things up. I figured I should just rest, get better physically and mentally and pursue a diagnosis. My girlfriend was very supportive throughout this. She had a holiday planned for months prior with her friend, so I wanted her to have a break from talk of poor health and financial implications etc. So she went. Came back a week later and I was still a slug, just sat around smoking weed, feeling sorry for myself. She didnt seem to pleased, and so begun the decline of our relationship. 

Around 3 weeks later, she abruptly broke things off with me. She says that she does still love me, but things are just too much. Her reasoning is completely understandable, but I've tried to fight for her regardless, to no avail. I've been manic these past few days, not giving her any space and just driving myself nuts. So I think in an effort to drive it home, she's said ""you have nothing real to offer me and my daughter"". This really hurt, because it's what I've feared her realising. 

So now I'm back living with my mother (suffers from NPD, is the source of a great deal of trauma) and I'm back to square one, again. What it God's name can I do? I feel so incredibly stuck and am seriously entertaining just ending my life, at this point it feels rational and justified. I have fight in me, but nowhere to direct it besides myself.",02Sep2019,2
150,"Heya. I’m a 15yo girl diagnosed with MDD and Aspergers (if that’s important). Throughout my life my mother has been emotionally abusive, to the point where I had tried to take my own life a few years back.

I’ve been living with my father for around 3 years, but I’m still legally obligated to stay with her every other weekend. Every time I go there it drains me. Sometimes I don’t even eat there because I don’t want to be around her. I tried to confront her about how she’s affected me, but that was a long while ago. I tried again about a year ago. Both results were the same, she just argued about how I took it the wrong way and how I’m blowing things out of proportion.

I’ve been much happier since living with my dad, and am nothing but grateful for everything he’s done to help me. But whenever I have to go back to her place I fall back into feeling miserable. I started seeing my mom start to treat my brother (12) in a similar way. I remember when she did that to me, and I expect that it will only worsen when he gets older.

That also gets me to thinking about my half brother (2), and about how I can’t save him from her when she starts with him, too. At least with the 12yo, my dad can take custody of him if he agrees to live with us. But with the youngest, I feel there’s no hope. When I hear them laugh together I think of how it won’t last, and she’ll treat him like shit just as she treated me.

A partner is gonna leave or chest on you anyway, and if you don't, the whole relationship is gonna be 75% suffering with bullshit. Working is just being someone's slave. Yeah, you can quit, if you wanna starve. Nobody is gonna come in your room, and it will get dirty again anyway. Exercising has no 'feel good' chemicals, everything you heard about that is a lie.
