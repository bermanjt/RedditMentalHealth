0,"Wow, just wow. Finally a song that describes what it feels like to feel nothing at all. And this video... just wow

1,"My father was a pilot. He worked 4 days a week and came home during the night so I basiclly got 2 1/2 days with him every week. My mom was at nursing school the whole day every day except the weekend. The only person watching me was my grandma. My grandma isn’t a good person. She’s very manipulative. 

How could this have defected me. Thanks",21Nov2019,1
2,"I smoked weed 4.5 years ago that sent me into a panic attack. I woke up the next day with heavy DP/DR. My visual perception had physically altered and everything looked dreamlike, literally. As a result, my doctor put me on Klonopin for 3 months. He then proceeded to cold turkey me off which wrecked me mentally and physically. To this day, my right arm feels weightless/detached despite nerve tests coming back fine. Brain MRI was fine. Only thing I haven’t tried is a spinal MRI. I’ve also went through a clostridium difficile infection which hasn’t helped my mental health. Im vitamin D deficient at levels of 22 which I’m sure isn’t helpful either, but don’t feel it’s the root cause since this all started after weed and a benzo withdrawal.

So for 4.5 years, I’ve been up and down. My natural baseline isn’t particularly anxious or depressed. I’m generally a happy, normal person and don’t have attacks anymore unless a medicine/drug triggers it. I am more susceptible to attacks if I take the wrong medicine, have too much caffeine etc.

But in the 4.5 years I’ve been “normal”, I’ve been SO foggy. I feel so glazed over and disconnected. My vision still remains hazy despite the prescription being the same. I know I’m real, but I barely feel like a person. I can have an awesome conversation with someone because I’m naturally personable, and they’ll never know I’m mentally just fogged out. 

Can anyone relate? Has anyone managed to fix this?",21Nov2019,1
3,"Weather it be a career, living space, vehicle, relationships etc. It seems I run out of interest and start wanting something new fairly quickly. There has to be some neurological aspect behind my actions and how easy it is for me to get bored of the current and want more. Anyone out there with more experience than me in life with the same “issues”? Are you still experiencing the same feelings? Did you remedy the situation? Just looking for some help or guidance.",21Nov2019,1
4,"Has anyone used telepsychiatry to ""visit"" a psychiatrist? Any recommendations, positive, or negative experiences to share? 

My general practitioner has prescribed SSRIs in the past, and I'm starting to wonder if I might need a little more knowledgeable professional to help from the medical side.",21Nov2019,1
5,"For example, old reggae music makes me wanna cry. The smell of women's perfume or men's cologne makes me scared, Rihanna's song ""Diamond"" makes me scared as well, or really any hit song that used to play on the radio from 2010-2016. I can't go near apartment buildings without feeling sick or irritated. That car freshener, the **blue** one to be specific, makes me wanna break down and cry and there's a ton more... why does this happen? Is there a specific reason, or am I just odd?",21Nov2019,1
6," **Hi… I’m sharing my story because instead of continuing to harm myself and indirectly affecting others, I want to change and say goodbye to this growing darkness within. Perhaps it’s silly to think that I can part with it forever as it is a part of me… But to be able to control it and not let it control me.**  
 

**As I want to remain anonymous I will refrain from specific names…**  
 

**I was born an only child in the USA… I had the privilege to grow up abroad. I lived there til the end of middle school… I had a great friend group and I felt quite content. My main passions being music and soccer… My parents who had split thought I’d be better off continuing my education back in the US. So I get sent off to a boys only boarding school in the northeast.**  
 

**What would seem like an amazing opportunity, to get sent to a prestigious all boys, coat and tie, Ivy League road kinda school seemed like the start of a rough chapter for me… Me, the wanna be musician, not wanting to cut my hair and conform to something I am not, aside from being bullied and getting depressed (and gaining a bunch of weight) didn’t sit well with me.**   
 

**My mother, feeling worried for me decided to take me on to continue my education elsewhere. We moved down south in the States and after moving through 2 different schools, I barely, but successfully got through high school.**   
 

**I always felt like an outcast, and loner kinda guy since I left Italy… Like I’d been separated from all my friends. Slowly but surely, music, particularly punk, rock and heavy metal music would help me meet my first good friends since I left my childhood home.**  
 

**We would see concerts together, jam out, and eventually I would join a local band. All through Junior and Senior year, it became clear to me that music was my calling in life, and that I was (and AM) convinced that there was nothing I rather do in life that be able to tour and play music I love around the world.**   
 

**Since I didn’t really have my dream band together and I had absolutely ZERO business sense back then, as my parents and family couldn’t shut up asking what my plans are for College, blah blah blah, the most logical thing was to attend music school.**   
 

**I didn’t get into the dream school right off the bat, but after a short stint in the local community college and a second audition, I was IN.**   
 

**I moved back up north to attend this amazing, world class school. Completely oblivious to what I wanted to study, or major in, all I knew was that I wanted to find some kickass bandmates to form my band.**   
 

**Right from the get go, I isolated myself… I didn’t really think much of it, but ever since I left Italy… I developed more social anxiety… I let fear cripple myself.**   
 

**I did really well in certain classes, but in the classes that tested the things most important to me, my creativity, my writing… I would simply not show up in the most important moments. When it came time to hand in the semester final project, I’d still be in my room in a panic working on the assignment afraid that it wasn’t good enough, that I would be laughed at by my peers. I failed several classes as a result.**

**My frustration, anger and anxiety within myself caused me to start taking my anger out on myself. I would become physically violent within my own home… I guess I didn’t want to involve other people, as I’m a pretty peaceful, loving person to others.** 

**I fell for a girl who seemed to share some of the same musical taste, and she was gorgeous with a lovely personality… Me being socially awkward perhaps, I didn’t know how to approach her as every time I saw her she was with her friends… I wrote her a letter once, which I guess she found kinda creepy… I was trying to approach her when I’d run into her around campus… But what was originally trying to run into her, became actively seeking her waiting for her to pass by the hall, or street. I was just a lonely, and kind of scared, but honestly harmless… But I realize now with some of the crazies out there, that she just got scared, and rightfully so.**   
 

**After two years at the school, I decided I needed a break from school, that maybe it was not for me. I did not make a big deal out of the chick that I liked and it’s remained mainly private, but I got pretty depressed about that. I’ve felt the need to apologize to her for the way I acted but have also been reluctant. Maybe I should do it.**

**My buddy who I was in bands with back in high school needed a bass player for his upcoming tour and invited me. It seemed like a great opportunity to be able to go out on the road playing music. I did it virtually for free… For a month an a half. Looking back, through some ups and some downs, that month touring playing music was one of the happiest moments of my life.**   
 

**One memory that always stuck though was when my buddies were having a pow wow and asking each other how many women they’d slept with… the circle turned around to me, and I had no answer… Or in turn I guess they knew that that answer was ZERO.** 

**Post tour, I was having trouble finding a job… I spent several months staying with family and a family friend.**   
 **I was playing a couple of shows locally… Which seemed like they could turn into something cool, but the circle I ran with was more focused on the partying, and I kinda got sucked into that.**   
 

**I discovered cocaine and developed a bit of a habit… But after going through $100 of it in a night, and literally sorting through paint chips on the floor to find any droppings of the coke, I decided maybe it’d be best to back off.**   
 

**I’d never had sex and I was 22 so I said fuck it and found a hooker. She must have close to 50 years old (and definitely did not match the picture on her listing haha) but she was actually quite a pleasant lady and of course I used a condom. I called another hooker another time, and got ripped off, and well kinda took a break from that bullshit for a while.**

**My father encouraged me to move to his city, where he ensured that there is a great job market… I should find a job no problem. After scouting out a couple of different jobs I got the job selling guitars… I’d end up playing them or fixing them more than selling them, but I was well liked among coworkers (or so I think) and got by for 2 years.**  
 

**Backtracking for a little bit… All through my life, I’ve never had a girlfriend… I’ve been in “love”, whatever that means, many times… But the girl I like either has another partner, rejects me, or increasingly so in recent years, ghosts me.**   
 

**The first chick that I got a “date” with was trying to get more intimate with me and stuff (and I didn’t even know it), and then next time I saw her she confessed that she has a kid… We pretty much stopped seeing each other since, and I believe she got back with the father. Good on her.**  
 

**As my dating frustrations increased, and my steady paycheck allowed me more spending money… I started to fill this void by seeing hookers. It at least felt like I temporarily sedated my loneliness and sexual feelings. Still kind of ignorant (or careless is perhaps the better word) financially speaking, I was blowing through my whole budget because of my poor decisions.**   
 

**A guy who I worked with who was one of the top salesman for the company would act like my friend… He invited me to write/record music and wanted to DO SOMETHING… One day, I tried to get him to help me with a piece of equipment… He didn’t seem to care to try to help me, and I called him out and said “why do you have to be such a fucking asshole?”… He told the boss. Boss told me not to curse/swear at him anymore. That dude is looking at me coming out of the office, and me, feeling that he could have confronted me directly and told me not to talk to him like that, I called him a “pussy” and the manager decided to send me home for the day. I got called up a couple of days later and was told HR reviewed the incident and that I was being terminated.**   
 

**Life goes on. I would get some new jobs and start working closer in music venues and with musicians I love, admire and respect. While certainly not lucrative, it felt like I was heading in the right direction to hopefully soon find some killer musicians and make my mark locally.**   
 

**For whatever reason that has not happened… I have struggled to make friends or be social here in this city. Lots of flakiness… People saying they want to do something and then ghosting me, or leaving me hanging.** 

**I've wasted away so much time and even money with BS dating apps like Bumble and Tinder that I felt needed to to extreme's to find someone of interest. So I even went as far as signing up for a site called Seeking Arrangements hoping to find a lady friend… I would help many of these girls with whatever means I could, but it would never be enough… and ultimately it left me with even more wounds to heal. At least I was able to discover intimacy, and learn that apparently I’m a pretty good fuck. Haha.**  
 

**Meanwhile in the last 2 years I realized that if no-one else wants to help me, I’m going to do this MYSELF. I decided to write and record all the parts for this project that I’m hoping to turn into a powerhouse band. Between writing and recording the music… I’ve spent most of the last 6-12 months either delivering food, or driving musicians while they stop by town.** 

**Back in September… There was an incident where one of the members of the artist entourage decided to threaten me with a gun while I was driving them. He started to load the magazine and then clocked the gun as to make me feel uneasy. This made me panic and I still am bothered about it from time to time.** 

**A couple of weeks back... I was feeling depressed just sitting alone at my home rotting away... I decided to go out on a limb and go street perform. After only 2 minutes of playing I was asked by two ""security guards"" to stop playing... That I can't play there when instead their coworker had told me there was a plug I could plug into, so I did just that.  I was being a bit of a punk and honestly sticking up for myself during some personal/internal challenges, so I refused to just stop. One of the guys put his hands on my neck and pushed me against the wall, while the other went and actually cut a hole in my speaker that I was using. They threatened to beat me up, and I ultimately got the cops to come to just settle the dispute. They let us all go, and thankfully the insurance I had originally bought with the speaker came into play.** 

**Lately I’ve been obsessed with wrapping up this full length album, but it’s come at a price… The amount of time and energy I’ve spent on this has meant that I haven’t worked much, haven’t been social and generally feel a bit unhealthy.**   
 

**I recently got a seasonal job offer with a major company to be a salesman at one of their highest volume stores… Something my friend referred me for about a year ago. I told my family about it, and they seemed delighted… Almost relieved, as if I’m FINALLY GOING TO GET A** **REAL JOB.**  
 

**I showed up to do the paperwork, and thought a copy of my documents would suffice, but they “NEEDED” the original. After having moved a lot in the last year, I’ve kind of lost track of certain personal belongings… In the worst timing, I completely forgot where I’d placed my passport and social security card.**  
 

**This made me think about the job more… Do I really want to be swarmed by customers during peak retail season??? NO, I do NOT. So I kept procrastinating about finding my documents… Also being so focused on my music, I felt it would greatly interrupt my workflow to go sort through boxes/cabinets for hours on end.**   
 

**Anyways… The company gave me a week to get back to them with documents and I kinda just let it pass. Tomorrow I’m supposed to go to Mexico for a cousin’s wedding, but after looking hard yesterday and this morning, I simply cannot find my passport. I could try to get an expedited replacement but I don’t have the money. I told my Mom that I unfortunately cannot make it (on her birthday) and she is pissed… tells me I owe her $1200.**   
 

**I haven’t even told my parents that I passed on the job opportunity, but I have a feeling that they’re gonna rip me apart for it. I think about what they think way too much.**   
 

**Since high school, my parents had me see a therapist. I still see the therapist weekly. He gives me a great deal, and he seems to be the person I probably talk to the most every week. He also saw/sees my Dad. I tell him I’m getting better, but I feel I’m lying to him and to myself.**   
 

**I used to tell people that I could never lie… I was always proud of being honest, and not cheating other people, but thinking about the last couple of years, I’ve been breaking all those rules. I keep getting what at first are just second chances… turning into third, fourth, fifth chances… And ultimately I’M ALWAYS THERE TO FUCK THINGS UP.**   
 

**The irony is the people that I work for compliment me for having the best manners, and attitude. I’ve been described as charismatic, and having a charming and very polite personality. I tend to be that way with others, except I seem to be hell bent on destroying myself, LITTLE BY LITTLE.**   
 

**I’ve thought about taking my life many times, but I don’t have the guts to do it. I’ve even opened up about it at times, and I’m thankful that there’s always love and support on the other side. I recently was having a tough time and a friend of a friend (who’s 55 years old) decided to take me out for lunch. It was a truly beautiful day for me. On that same day I got invited to have coffee with another family friend… A high school buddy was visiting town, and I got invited by a cute girl to a halloween party.**   
 

**I kinda like her… I gave her and her friends a ride to the club they wanted to go to, and once we’re there she tells me she isn’t feeling that great and she kinda wants to go back home. She told me I should go and party with everyone, but I insisted that I hate parties and that I rather spend the time with her. She told me she could uber but I thought that was unnecessary, so I offered to drop her off at home and I did just that. I still felt kinda lonely going back home at the end of the night but at least I felt like I was cared for that day. I felt like some people had my back.**   
 

**The difficult thing for me is that on a day like today, where I completely fuck my mother over because I can’t get my shit together and can’t find my fricken passport, I just wish I could fall off the face of the earth. I’ve had suicidal thoughts today again, but the thing that makes me think it over is that I don’t want to leave the people that know me the pain, and suffering of knowing I took my life.**   
 

**I’m also tired of people giving me opportunities and second chances, yet I know I can’t pay them back, or give back to them… I’m day by day more conscious and embarrassed of showing up at a birthday or a holiday gathering and not bringing a gift because I’m broke, scrapping up pennies, or selling my equipment to feed myself at times.**   
 

**There’s a girl I fancy that works at the supermarket right down the corner, but I’m with such low self esteem right now that I’ve lost the drive to go and ask her out. The other day my Dad asked me how I’m doing… I told him I’m stressed out because of trying to wrap up my music project. But what I didn’t tell him is that I think there’s a lot more I’m stressed out and struggling with besides the music.** 

**I’ve been struggling for a long time, and I don’t know what to do. I don’t like to hurt other people so I hurt myself instead… And in turn, the other people close to me ultimately pay the price, bailing me out and trying to keep their faith in me.**   
 

**It’s come to the point where I felt like being public about my struggles and maybe getting some insight into how I should shift into a positive direction and stay there.**   
 

**I’m a team player, and work well with others, but when it comes to myself, I’m piss poor… Mean, spiteful and detrimental to my own psyche. I know some people might laugh about this, because I know my parents and a lot of others would simply say I just need a JOB… I definitely need steady income…** 

**But what I’ve been thinking that I need is to do some sort of shamanistic healing trip. DMT, or a serious dose of mushrooms with guidance of someone wise and experienced. I’m not really a big believer in western medicine… When the doctors wanted to give me Ritalin for my ADHD back in high school, I did not want to do it.**  
 

**I tried to do Yoga earlier this year but didn’t really stick with it… I tried to join a soccer club locally for a bit, but it’s a bunch of scrubs playing satisfied with losing 10-0.**   
 

**I actually went and got a job while macrodosing on LSD years ago… Had a great demeanor, was assertive and got the job without even being interviewed. So I know people think this is probably unorthodox as fuck, but I think maybe psychedelics can help me get back on a positive journey.**   
 

**I’m letting past scars come to the surface and letting them win. I must defeat these demons or they will defeat me.**   
 

**To anyone and everyone who reads, chimes in and has something to say I appreciate you… I realize that my story might be received with a fair share of negative response. That’s okay… I’m human. I’m not perfect in any way. One thing I know for sure is that I’ve never tried to hurt anyone but myself. To anybody that I’ve let down or broken a promise to, I sincerely apologize, and I’m hoping that I can make it up to you down the road.**   
 

**Okay… So now that I’ve gotten this out of my head… I’ve got an album to send to the mastering engineer. It’s my baby and I’m so excited to get it out in the world. My dream is that I actually can get out there and play music because when I’ve been out there playing music those have been the happiest and most joyful moments of my life. I want to travel again, be happy again… I want to live again!!!**  
 

**FYI - No hookers and cocaine for me in months, but I still manage to self sabotage. So clearly the problem is internal. I’m about to watch this video “The Psychology of Self-Sabotage and Resistance”**

[**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPIsRwf5Mmc&amp;t=3s**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPIsRwf5Mmc&amp;t=3s)

**One of the top comments quotes something said in the video. “What you fear is an indication of what you seek”. That leaves me a lot to think about… An old shrink told me once that I’m afraid of success. We often brought up successful people as examples… He used to talk about guys like Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant and say that their worst fear was to fail. I know that I do want to succeed, but I realize that I have a lot of work to do to develop the tools to consistently cultivate success for myself.**  
 

**With love and respect to all you who read my story. Thank you!!!**",21Nov2019,1
7,"My brother was sectioned 2 days ago, a lot of things have been building up in his life with his job, gf, friends, childhood etc.  He's never dealt with anything properly and has remained fairly dependent on other people emotionally and would procrastinate even when prompted to do what's needed to be done. Now he's away from the noise of his relationship and day to day distractions I think he has the chance to reset. 

 I feel like visiting straight away will make him become dependent upon me and my brother's/sisters visits, rather than dealing with his problems himself so he can become more independent. 

I'm not really sure what to think though, hence the post I guess, thanks for reading I'd I'd really appreciate any advice.",21Nov2019,1
8,"After years of being on denial and thinking that everything is going to be ok, I decided to go to a psychologist and explore the possibility of going through therapy. Today, I was told my diagnosis, and although I was expecting most of the things listed, I was not expecting dysthymia and/or PDD. I'm somewhat surprised but not really? Not sure how I feel? 
That's it, I literally don't have anyone else to share this with, so yeah....I hope I don't offend anyone",21Nov2019,1
9,"I’m horrified by some of the things I’ve written. We’ve written... it’s brought everything flooding back and I’m an idiot for reading it. I just couldn’t remember that time. I wanted my time back... 

It’s 1am and I have to be up at five if I’m going to catch my flight on time. Fuck I’m an idiot. Why do I do this to myself?",21Nov2019,1
10,"First off, I’m (22F) not sure if any of what I have to say will make sense. It may seem all over the place and I apologize if it is. I’m still trying to understand my own feelings myself.  

To start, I don’t think I’ve been “happy/okay” for a very long time. I’m not sure when it all really began, but maybe somewhere in middle school. I feel like I’ve always been a relatively “depressed” person or just having those kind of sad feelings, just not very outwardly. It wasn’t until I started birth control in 2017 that things got progressively worse. I had finished community college, I had just started dating my boyfriend, it should have been a positive time in my life and it was, but I could not hide how bad I was feeling. I knew it was the birth control and after a few months on it I told my doctor about how I was feeling. She brushed it off and just said “it’ll go away soon, your body is just trying to get used to the hormones”. I felt kinda brushed to the side, but I waited to see if it got better...and it absolutely has not lmao. (I’ve had a more recent check up with a new doctor and told them what was going on and they took it more serious. They said I could switch or change BC’s at anytime. I declined at the time because I wasn’t feeling this bad. I’ve changed BC’s before, I hate having to get used to the new hormones, it’s a terrible process. I’ve basically just tried to suck it up and deal with how I’ve felt while on my current one.)

For some context to all of this, the end of 2018 and all of this year (2019) has been the absolute worst for me employment wise. I got laid off from my job at the end of 2018. It was a job I hated, but it was unexpected and it didn’t give me a chance to find anything in its place before it happened. It took me 7 months and countless applications (definitely went into a deep depression because of it), only for me to end up working back at that same job (they were the only ones who I knew for a fact would hire me on the spot). I recently quit a little over a month ago because it started taking such a toll on my mental health. Anxiety had started manifesting itself physically for me, which has never happened before. I even went to urgent care once because I didn’t know what was happening. I had decided it was all too much and I quit. I hadn’t found anything in its place, but I had started the process for looking for employment before I left. I was hoping and praying I would be more positive about the job search and things wouldn’t be as bad, but I’ve honestly fallen (more quickly this time) into a deeper depression than the first. At this point, I don’t know if it’s the birth control, my life at the moment, or maybe a combination of both. I just know I’m having suicidal thoughts/ideations and it scares me. I don’t plan or want to act on any of them, I just never thought I’d be this way and I don’t know know who to talk to as far as friends and family because I don’t want to scare them. I really want to speak to a therapist, I’ve been wanting to for a while (before all the employment issues), but I have no insurance and money is an issue. Anyway, this all was more of me just venting and just hoping someone out there might understand how I’m feeling. I just feel kind of alone at the moment.",21Nov2019,1
11,"Hi everyone!

As the title says, I did indeed eliminate everything from my life that brought me joy. Okay, so this is a long story, but I will try to condense it a bit. I have always been a very driven person, at least according to other people. So driven that I started eliminating the things I loved from my life to become more productive. This desire to eliminate the things I loved grew and grew and grew; before I had even realized what I was truly doing to myself, it was too late. Everything was gone.

Things stayed like this for a while. During this time period, my blossoming ""obsession"" with exercise was growing, too. It was the only thing that made me feel normal. Without exercise, I wouldn't want to be alive. It also improved my academic performance, so that was a definite bonus in my eyes. At this time, I also started listening to audiobooks. The one that still impacts me the most to this very day is ""Can't Hurt Me"" by David Goggins. This is were things started going south. I really misinterpreted his message. Now that I look back on it, the message of this book was not at all what I had originally thought. I thought David was trying to say, ""You are supposed to suffer. All the time. If you're not suffering, you aren't trying hard enough."" (This is clearly not what he was trying to convey; absolutely no hate on David Goggins) I ran with this twisted message, and thus succeeded in making my life a living hell. I won't talk about the more specific, more twisted things I did, but here's a general list: (Of course, for some people, these won't seem so bad, but everything's relative, I guess)

1. Eat once a day
2. Clean all of the dishes, or put away the clean dishes before eating a meal that I purposely made taste like nothing,
3. Take away aesthetically pleasing things, like posters in my room, not wearing clothes i liked, etc.
4. Completely stopped playing video games, watching Netflix, Hulu, etc. and consuming all entertaining media, including music.
5. Slowly cut off all of the close friendships I had to increase productivity
6. Continue exercising even after I was clearly over training
7. Much more

Eventually it became so bad that I was beginning to have actual breakdowns at least one to two times per week where I just wouldn't do anything for at least half the day, or not make dinner and binge on unhealthy food in the pantry instead. By this time I was starting to realize that this just wasn't sustainable. I had a choice: either kill myself or stop doing certain things that made life unbearable. And so, with a lot of talking with my father, progressing and then regressing again, I learned to live again, at least a little.

And, as of recently, I started looking at the person I was now versus several years ago; to say I was completely different is almost an understatement. I have different interests, different habits, different everything. I truly love living a life of strenuousness; a life of constant challenge; a life of mental stimulation; and a life of physical labor. But something is still really wrong. While I may have grown to enjoy growing and developing as a person, there is still nothing that I find true joy from. I would really like to discover this joy once again. I not only want to live a life of difficulty, but a life of joy too. 

The problem right now is that I don't have many interests as I kind of *destroyed* them all, so I want to discover new ones. I no longer have any desire to play video games, watch TV, or listen to music, so those are out the window. I've started reading fiction recently, but it's not as enjoyable as I remember. Those were the things I used to find relaxing and enjoyable, but, since they don't work anymore, I need other things. I've tried meditating, and I quite like it. But it's just relaxing; not really fun or exciting.

Can you help me?

TL;DR - I became 'addicted' to suffering, and destroyed all the joy in my life. I've realized the errors I made, and I want to learn how to live more joyfully again.",21Nov2019,1
13,"Obviously as mere mortal humans we cannot perceive the thoughts and feelings of others directly and so I am wondering what exactly is meant by that to help figure out whether I do perceive others emotions or if what I feel is something different.  If all it means is picking up on body language then I think I do that pretty well, I guess.  

But there is also part of me that thinks maybe I do not perceive others emotions.  My entire existence is fueled around anxiety and racing thoughts/overthinking things.  I could actually just be feeling my own anxieties in response to peoples social cues that I misinterpret or amalgamate into me ""sensing their emotion"" when I could be almost entirely wrong on a regular basis because it's only my personal feeling being projected incorrectly.

I mean, if someone is crying because their dog died, is sensing their emotion the ability to think ""I bet if my pet died, I'd be pretty sad too"" or is it the ability to determine what is and is not ok to say in response?  I think if just knowing what they want to hear is apart of it, it would be really easy to misinterpret your picking up on emotions with simple learned social mores/""rules"".

Sorry if this is not a typical post here, but it is something constantly on my mind because all my life I just seem to have had such a hard time forming relationships with anyone.  I'm fine socially in short bursts, but long, sustained conversation or relationships I just fall apart.",21Nov2019,1
14,"Hey guys, so I’m a 30M who is diagnosed bipolar. I’ve had a ton of success over the past 4 years in regards to my mental health through consistent counseling, exercise, and meditation. I have friends and family who struggle with mental health either due to poor habits or traumatic pasts, and it can be hard to break through to them on how to take care of themselves. How do I approach people about how to take better care of themselves? Without coming off as condescending or holier or thou?",21Nov2019,1
15,"I have severe persistent depressive disorder, ADHD, &amp; panic disorder.  Since September, I have been in the deepest level of depressive hell I’ve ever been in. I was admitted to a partial hospitalization program for the month of October (was there all day but went home at night). I was feeling good toward the end like I’d learned new things but after being back at work full-time (I still worked while I was hospitalized which I found out most people don’t do because of the stress) I am still just really wanting to die. I’m horribly lonely &amp; since I was allowed to “be myself” in treatment I’m having an even harder time trying to hide the crazy back at work because I was allowed to express it for a whole month. 

The only coping skills I learned at therapy were to focus on breathing for 3-5 minutes a day and do thought logs when I have an issue. I’m heavily medicated at this point and have tried to do breathing occasionally but I’m not doing it everyday. I don’t have the energy or willpower. I see a counselor once every couple of weeks.

16,"After a really bad friend group drama, a toxic friend keeps talking about it and keeps complaining at my boyfriend and told him in college shes never talking to him again. I get really stressed around that group now and i get lightly ignored when i do sit with them.

At home, my mum complained about how i dont eat all of my food and when i told her to stop she told me to shut up because shes talking to my father. There was some past family issues but they are very old and despite the complaining its much better now.

My boyfriend said that he broke off every past relationship, and because i always feel upset around him that he feels like he is messing up. Hes really the best guy in the world but after being rejected all my life i really wish i could for once be happier with someone who i have a close bond with. I keep crying and i cant help it, it hurts so much all the time and i wish it would stop.

18,"Not sure if this is the right place for this, but I need advice on coping with extreme loneliness. A year ago, I had a wife and a 6 year old and 9 year old and a dog. My dog died and then my wife told me she no longer loved me. I won’t go into the details but she fell in love with someone else and I’m better off for it. We divorced soon after and for the first time in the past year I’m trying to learn to live alone. I was dating and in a serious relationship for several months but I think this was to soon. I didn’t get a chance to take a breath and learn how to live alone again and without my kids in a healthy way. It definitely helped me cope with not getting to have my kids everyday like I used to. I only see them on weekends.

So going from the hectic married life with two young kids and school and a dog and helping with dinner, their homework, and taking them to school every morning to this.... a giant empty house from sunday night to friday afternoon has been really painful. It’s dark and quiet and I find myself going out and drinking and not being the most productive person just so that I can be around other people. I feel like since I’ve been completely alone now (not dating for over a month and a half) it’s getting slightly better but how long does it take for this to become the new normal? After a 13 yr marriage, a dog for 11 yeas and kids for 10 years? I’m going through the motions and am barely able to keep plants alive. I’ve been told to focus on work and I do but I work for a bank and it’s just tough to continue to be motivated.

I’m definitely not ready for a pet yet but if anyone has coping mechanisms that aren’t self destructive and can help me in this journey to learning to live with being alone, please let me know.",21Nov2019,1
19,"I have been diagnosed with: Major Depressive Disorder, Dysthymia, Social Anxiety Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder and ADHD.  I am on ritalin and 450 mg venlafaxine/ effexor/ prozac daily.

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment, I am dealing with some intestinal/ bowel problems as well as tendonitis which is making it hard to do strenuous exercise - a hobby I could consistently do which would help ease my mind and encourage constructive thoughts and behavior.  Besides this though, there is one specific mind-state I always fall victim to when I feel particularly lost which is just to time-waste.  I am at the stage where I am afraid of things to the point at which I don't register it, it instead just feels like some bizarre mental block - like, I just have no opportunities in my mind, yet I could easily go to a cafe or message a friend saying anything just to do something.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I have been waking up or getting back from my psychiatrist and compulsively opened up twitch and/ or youtube to get some sense of social connection.  This is really toxic for me because I am not even really engaged in the content, I am merely putting it on to numb some of the boredom, and both wastes time and makes me feel inevitably worse.  Today I just chucked on some Thelonious Monk and forced myself to do my chores, eat breakfast and shower before I did anything else and so far I just feel so much more mindful despite being in more-or-less the same situation.  It feels really counter-intuitive however, as I can never think of any particular artist/ album that I should put on normally, and it always feels pointless to do these more 'delayed gratification' things despite knowing that they line up with my view of a 'successful day' more than the candy of immediate gratification such as twitch/ youtube.

&amp;#x200B;

All too often I piss days away putting on a twitch stream and playing poker/ speed chess/ hearthstone or some other relatively low attention game.  After this, everything else is too slow paced and requiring too much effort, thus I rarely have the mindfulness to say, read a book, which ***feels*** both less productive and more demanding than doing something more stimulating (and also easier/ less demanding to actually do).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone know how I can get through this?  I was honestly contemplating getting back into smoking a couple cigs a day if I could use them to incentivize more disciplined structure.  Ultimately I need to develop more mindfulness about my day and am not too sure how to.",21Nov2019,1

27,"Hello everybody. To add some context, I am 17, nearly 18 and am a senior in High-school. I am at high school for one period a day and the rest of the day I attend classes at my local college. 4 days a week I work at my job. Some days I go to school from 8:45 to around 1:00, some days its 8:45 to 11:00, depending on what day it is. I also take an online class.

So to the mental health part. I always have a super hard time waking up in the morning. I make sure to get a minimum of 8 hours of sleep, and still would rather die than wake up in the morning. I am also tired nearly all day. Today I woke up, went to class, came home, slept for another hour, did homework, went to work, and I am finally home and have more homework but want to go to sleep so bad. I am pretty good at math, I got a 35 on the math section of the act,  but currently have a 71% in Calculus. 

Motivation problems... I easily have 4 hours in between work and my classes, but it is so hard to do things. I'm sure people are thinking, ""Just don't be a lazy fuck"" and while I am a lazy fuck, I am trying to fix why I just can't do it. I don't know how. I try to force myself to complete my work, and while I am, it takes so long because I always get distracted. 

Some nights I just get so depressed. I think about how bad I am doing in math, and I am supposed to be good at it. I study and still do bad.  Sometimes in the last hour of my shift, I just feel like crying- and I don't hate my job. I should have a happy life except for the fact that I am single and always have been, but the rest of my life is good. I just got accepted to my dream college today, but still, I feel depressed. I have never felt suicidal, never self harmed, and I do not feel the urge to, but damn I am hurting for no reason.  

Any advice I would greatly appreciate. I don't know if I should just push myself to do more or what. Thank you for reading this far.",21Nov2019,1
28,"this is a throwaway for obvious  reasons 

I don't nowhere to begin, but I don't see a point in living anymore. for the past couple of years I have lost joy in everything I do. I was tricked into staying in a third world country for 6 years (ages 12-18). I hated that place, I was beating , bullied, and my relatives I was living with could care less. to them I was a pay check( my parents were paying them to take care of me). they took my passport so I could not leave. after a while I stated to think that death was better option then staying in that hell. I tried multiple times to kill my self when I was there. I tried to overdose on painkillers, run in front of cars to get hit. each time I was taking to the hospital and didn't die. I tried begging to my parents to bring me back home, but they would respond with "" you will stay there for as long as I want and there is nothing you can do, you can begging and cry , but if i want you will die there. I don't care about you, you can die for all I care."" and this conversation is repeated in my head day after day. At around year 3 I was hopeless I have given up at begging and plead, I had tried to run to an embassy , but I was in a very rural area that I could not afforded the fare. I started to stop feeling happy or sad, but only anger. I would get in fights every single night, if I won, or lost it didn't matter. I would take out my anger on my self with self mutation and others with my fists. 

when I turned 18 my parents sent one of my cousins to give my passport ( he is only a couple months older than me) . this is the only cousin I love and respect .  when I was taken to that country he was very vocal that it was morally wrong what is going on .he vowed that he would not talk to anyone in the family till I come back, and that includes his parents. when I came back I so angry at my parents that I didn't know what to do with them, but they acting like nothing had happened. like I wasn't in hell for 6 years, like I didn't beg and cry to leave that place, nothing. I though that I would be better to use my anger to pass my GED. I study for two months ( March, February) and I passed the test and now I'm going to community College. I hate my life now, I wish I had just killed my self. every morning I hear a voice in my ear that is say just to kill your self and that you are not worth shit. my parents praise me to the other family members ( I hate them too) about how I worked hard to get my GED and how I caught back up to my grade.  my friends that I knew before are all telling me to go see help. they have told me that sometimes  I will have wild mood swings when im with them or I will just shut down and just be like a ghost.  I want to what should I do? I don't want to destroy my friendships because they are all I have . I feel like I have no one to take to that will actually understand what I'm feeling.When I'm with my friends I don't really take about what happened its very difficult for to explain to them  what happen because when I start to I begin  to recall all of pain at once.

I thought I was just having intense panic attacks but recently I have been doing some things that I can’t explain. Like I took down all the mirrors in my house and covered any camera on my phone and computer because I thought people were watching me. Also one day I was hanging out with my friends and after they left I was driving home alone and started talking to them like they were right next to me.

40,"For the past 3 years I have had one obsession that will not go away. It has been this persistent thought about desiring mental illness. I have good reason to say I have OCD but I have never seen a psychiatrist for that specifically. It started when I was in 7th grade. I started dealing with more psychiatric symptoms that I did not really understand. I was having some minor hallucinations that I made out to be worse than  they were because I was obsessed with getting a diagnosis of schizophrenia. I understand how awful schizophrenia is, I constantly read online and in the DSM-5 about the different mental illnesses there and strive to understand what it means to deal with something like that. I know how awful it is to feel this way, I have told myself this so many times and I have been told this by others including my therapist. Eventually I stopped obsessing about schizophrenia when I started showing symptoms of Bi-polar disorder. I would have short manic episodes about 3 times a week and would take Clonazepam. I saw the psychiatrist for this and he was trying to decide between panic disorder and bi polar disorder. Before he could come to that conclusion my Mom did more research and found out that I most likely an auto immune disorder called PANS. So fast forward to now. I still deal with obsessions about different psychiatric illnesses. I hate it so much. I have learned so much about mental illness but I still cannot shake this feeling. It gets to the point to where I miss my psychiatrist visits. It is one of my favorite places to go to be honest. I miss seeing my old therapist as well. I have tried to find information about this topic online and I cannot find anything that is helpful. I understand how bad this sounds.

44,"So, lately, I've come to realize a lot of things about me that I did not before. I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask for advice but please direct me to the right subreddit if I'm wrong.

First of all, I want to talk about my nervous laughter. I literally laugh while saying EVERYTHING. Even when I'm supposed to be serious. Even when I'm dead serious. It rubs off very wrong to people. They think I'm either taking things lightly or they just think I'm fake.

Speaking of which, I go above and beyond for people. To the point that I would even voluntarily spend my time and money on them. Sometimes I end up insisting them to ask for my help way more than I should. I seem very needy and it makes them feel like I'm trying to show myself as superior to them. Most of the time people will use my help and discard me. Then, I'm left complaining about how ungrateful they are.

I'm also very, very socially anxious. The thing is that I'm an only child and grew up isolated in a bit of a troubled environment. What that means is that I had all the means and resources that I needed \[not luxurious but humble\], but I never had a voice. Nor did I have enough social experience. I don't have the ability to stand up for myself because I fell like I'll be the bad guy. Never was able to express myself freely without societal judgment and criticism. I also went through a traumatic abusive phase in my late teens. That made me so aware of people around me that even as I type this, I'm aware of people around me and am worried that someone is reading all of this and judging me.

I have suffered from what people told me was anxiety and depression. It is affecting my relationships with people. I don't really have anyone to speak about my deepest concerns with. Some of my closest friends have no clue of the crazy shit I've been through. I just feel like I have so many different lives- each face for every person I know. It's taking a toll on me. Sometimes when I'm overwhelmed, I end up blabbering about some parts of my problems to many different people and later regret it or feel bad when they ask me about it later. People call me weird all the time. I've been called a robot too.

I'm so negative, very pessimistic and can't be positive. I always devalue myself in front of others and later they start devaluing me. It's almost like I gave them permission to do so. I can't even feel emotions deeply anymore- happiness, sadness, nothing really. Sometimes I feel this insane pain and I shut down. Sometimes I'm happy and everything seems fine. But nothing for long.

As for making new friends, it's easy initially. I'm usually the one to initiate a friendship and the one trying hard to keep it. One reason I think is that I can't let my guards down with anyone and that makes everything uncomfortable. I've been almost bullied for my circumstances by people and judged by them even though I have no control over them. I just can't tell my friends about it. Forget about a relationship- I don't even think anyone would ever be permanent in my life and actually live and care about me. I have insane trust issues. I have never had an actual family so I don't know how living with people works and when I'm in a family environment, too many conflicts happen. I'm still hopeful but at this point, everything about me screams insecurity- from my face to my speech, posture, and my mannerisms. I used to be healthy, confident- not caring about anyone's perception of me. What happened?

Another part of my life is the insane fear of everything- people, judgment, new experiences, driving, love, whatnot. I have always played it safe in life and right now my situation doesn't allow me to take any risks because my only parent's life is also dependent on me. I'm financially, geographically and culturally restricted. I feel like I have no life. I feel guilty when I enjoy myself because I feel like I only deserve slogging. Especially when my parent is working so hard for me and sacrificing so much. Even when I'm happy, I feel like something bad is coming up so I can't enjoy myself at all. Sometimes, when I get to experience something that I like, I get too hyper and act weird.

I really like to believe that I can be likable and still powerful enough to control my life but I don't know where to start. It seems like my happiness depends on how others treat me that day and not my inner self.

I'm burning out. So much that people around me tell me that I need a break and need to pick up a hobby. I don't even have a place to live \[I'm living with someone else currently\] so it's not easy for me to try things out because they get annoyed. I'm also very indecisive so I don't even know what my hobby is. I've never had the opportunity to explore what I like. I have some interests, but no will to do anything. Even when I try to do something, I feel like its childish because people tell me so and give up.  I don't know what to do...

I have tried basically everything I could- therapy, speaking to people, meditation. Meditation somewhat helps once in a blue moon but I overthink a lot so my brain doesn't calm down at all. Trust me I've tried for years. I'm so tired of living like this. I'm putting limitations on myself even though people tell me I'm capable of so much - I just think they're being nice. I don't know whom to believe and whom to not. I wish there was a way out of this. Please help me out of this...

P.S.: Sorry for the long post. I'm so fucking fed up of living like this that I had to vent out somewhere.",21Nov2019,1
45,"I try to go to therapy every week but I haven't been able to see my therapist consistently due to her schedule being booked and having only half an hour sessions available which I think are a waste of time. Starting the 11th of December, I will be able to see my therapist weekly except the week of Christmas because my appointment falls on Christmas day. So I have to skip a week. I find it annoying how there's so many gaps in our visits and it's not even on me. Also, the hour sessions go by too fast and I can't afford two hour sessions and I don't think they even provide sessions that last longer than an hour. So when I get home from therapy, i feel like we didn't discuss a lot of things that were on my mind. I want to share my poetry and my songs with my therapist but I never have time to because my personal problems take up all the time. And I'm starting to think it's not worth it. I definitively need therapy. Many people on reddit have told me I need therapy. I can't go without therapy. And I like my therapist. But it just sucks because I feel like i spend an hour talking to her about one thing and then I won't see her again until two or three weeks later.",21Nov2019,1

Whenever it’s time for an in person interview I just get the shakes, my head starts spinning, I can barely breathe I don’t even recognize where I’m at and I throw up. I’m at risk of getting kicked out of school because every time I show up I sit in the parking lot trying to gather the courage to go in but 90% of the time I just can’t do it.

I want to keep with my therapist as the therapy is slowly helping with my depression but my psychiatrist keeps me on SSRI’s which I’ve tried multiple of and none have helped and she keeps saying for me to take hydroxyzine which just makes me anxious and jumpy. I’ve tried doing all the things my therapist said to do for anxiety but none of it helps.

I thought it really helped me feel better and I met some incredible people/friends. I just wish I was able to start exposure therapy sooner (for my extreme anxiety and panic disorder). I didn’t start right away because I had to feel comfortable there first and do interoceptive exercises first. I really wish I could have gotten more exposure work in. 

I have feel better emotionally this past year, however my anxiety still makes it impossible for me to attend college or go on job interviews. I’m thinking about going back and then I will be able to start the exposures sooner since I know the place and the people. I haven’t been able to find someone to work on exposures with outside of the residential treatment center I went to. Not sure what other options I have.

I have some friends and about 50% of the time, my proposals to do something/hangout are shot down. I don’t know if they can see I’m losing my mind, don’t like me that much, or actually are just busy... but I see them on Snapchat and instagram with other people so I guess I’m just not one of their go to friends.

I just can’t grasp how somebody who would do anything to help anybody felt like he couldn’t ask for help. I haven’t stopped thinking about this since I heard the news. I work in a profession where suicide is very common. But there’s also the feeling of weakness for seeking help. I’ve wrote and delete multiple text messages to co workers today because I got that familiar feeling of weakness. 

I also work in a profession where you have to be on your toes at all times. I have to be at work in 6 hours. And I’m still laying here just thinking why didn’t he reach out.

55,Ok so for context I (25M) have exhibited these symptoms for a long time as long as I can remember. My childhood wasn’t particularly bad the regular stuff. I was bullied for a bit. Got hung upside from a tree one time got beat up a little bit. But I never told anyone really. I was a sensitive kid I think. I grew up a bit and stopped getting bullied because I had become the bully in many ways. I started manipulating people to “work” for me. In elementary school my friends called me sir. Then (this is the last time I remember feeling empathy for an animal) I watched my dog being put down by my father in the back yard because it was dying slowly. (We didn’t have time to get it to a hospital) I couldn’t tell anyone about it and it hurt me a lot. I don’t blame him though he did what he thought was right. I’ve never really cared about anyone. There is ofc the odd exception but mostly people are just kind of peripheral. I’m outwardly very social and friendly but I don’t enjoy the social interaction for any other reason than it gives me power. I lie and I cheat and I steal and I manipulate and I don’t care. I’m wondering if I should seek help or if it even matters at this point. I’m pretty much constantly bored so I do things of increasing risk to feel something. I’m definitely a bit aggressive at times. I can be a real jerk. Some people say they get a weird vibe from me like I’m plotting something or lying to them. Anyway just wondering what the internet thinks. Thanks.,21Nov2019,1
56,"I apologize beforehand, I have no idea if this is the right place to post this.

I am 14 and recently, my short-term memory has gotten so bad it scares me. It's so bad that we will have a 5-minute discussion about someone in one of my classes and then, 5 minutes later I will have to ask someone to remind me who we were talking about. I'll remember what they did and why it was important, but not who their name was or how the conversation got started in the first place. Or I'll be writing something or solving something and suddenly I will lose all focus and it will take an extreme effort to remember enough to continue writing/thinking. 

I'm very worried because I used to have a relatively high IQ on internet IQ tests, around 125, but now I just get like 100-110. Also, I've found I am much worse at reading (books and online) and have to reread lines much more often, and my spelling's gone downhill.

A few possible causes: I've noticed this change after starting high school this fall (for reference I was homeschooling previously), and I've been getting less sleep (7-8 hours on average) than ever before in my life. Also, I got a phone for the first time in my life when I started high school and honestly feel like it's been making me dumber. I've also noticed some twitch/youtube addiction issues (I noticed someone else posting about this as well) that haven't been helping. I'll get home, lie to my parents that I'm doing homework, then watch twitch or youtube for 2 hours before eating dinner and then finally doing my homework afterward.

However, on the flip side, I am taking all advanced classes and my grades are all As. I've also been getting a lot more exercise. I haven't ever been diagnosed with any mental problems, and the rest of my life is fine (no major changes, etc.) I feel like I'm staying healthy except for some technology addiction. So I honestly don't know what the problem is, and why I am suddenly having memory/thought process/attention/distraction/etc difficulties that I've never experienced before. 

Thanks for any advice - I know this isn't a lot of information. Feel free to ask for more.

58,"I was at Dairy Queen one night with my friends and I saw two guys sitting down and eating burgers. They were a lot older. For some reason, I felt sorry for them. I had absolutely no reason to. Literally, nothing is unfortunate about two old guys hanging out at night eating burgers.

I don't know what it was about the situation. Maybe I associated the image with the fictional event of someone shaming these guys for eating GMOs. That would have been really sad. I have no idea what made me sad about this.

On another instance, this girl offered me pumpkin pie and I said ""maybe later."" There was literally no reason to feel sorry for her but I did for some reason.

I'm trying to understand the reason for why this happens and/or if there's some kind of solution.

I also feel sorry for people sometimes. People have been really mean to me, but then they'll tell me about their problems and I'll feel sorry for them and forgive them for being mean. This has happened with multiple people. That's not what this post is about, though it might be related.

I also tend not to feel sorry for people who are actually in really difficult situations. I see homeless people all the time around my city and I don't feel sorry, even though I know someone without a home is in a much less fortunate situation than someone eating DQ with his friend is in.

66,"May be obvious, but recently I've just been feeling like shit because of Twitter, I know I know, just delete the app but the positives I do get out of it is keeping up with current events. I believe it's important knowing whats going on, but the major downside is the hatefulness. I'm not talking about Nazis or alt-right trolls, I don't follow those people. I'm talking about literally anywhere you look, someone is crushing someone for loving something, or feeling a certain way. It's just so vitriolic and repulsive that it makes me feel like humanity has just devolved to selfish beasts that all hate themselves and enjoy bullying one another. I'm really looking for a positive place anywhere to talk about movies, something I'm very into, but I can't find it. I'm either called a film bro, or an art hoe, or pretentious, or I haven't watched this fucking movie so I'm not a real fan, oh you like this director? Of course you do, so predictable. It's like that with anything, replace movies with music and you find the same thing. It's really crushing my spirit and all these people I follow who constantly post about how woke they are and how accepting they are, are also some of the most vitriolic people I've ever seen on the internet, like they just seem to love to wallow in other people's shame and misery. It's toxic. And I'm disappointed in people, cause half the people I follow are older then me and just seem like miserable people being snarky on the internet for internet points. Like I said, I know this is incredibly obvious to anyone who's spent anytime on the internet, but who tf wants to listen to me complain about Twitter in real life? It's actually been bothering me for awhile and I just need some positivity right now. I need to know that people can be respectful and non judgemental and not selfish and uncaring. It also sucks because politically speaking, if your politics side with workers, poor and marginalized people, you would think it would attract individuals who think of others and care about others well being but instead it attracted a bunch of fucking clout chasers trying to get likes for their dumb fucking zingers on the internet and the ""movement"" has been overtaken by white women trying to outwoke each other and then their male counterparts hoping to fuck by saying and even woker thing. But like whats actually being done? None of these conversations on the internet actually help those people they claim to care about, people in Flint still have no water, reality is being twisted in such a way that people can't tell what's real news and what isnt. The world is actually ending and all these people can do is just scream into a nothing hole of 1 and 0s. Maybe I'm being overly dramatic but I genuinely cannot comprehend how we got here, and how we're gonna get out of this. I just wish people would give a shit about anything other then themselves. It's so pathetic and lame, but most of all, depressing. It's like they don't realize their as bad as the sad loser on 4chan saying racist shit. They contribute nothing other then negativity to the already endless void of negativity that is the internet and at this rate I don't think I can fucking handle another fucking minute on this fucking weird stupid thing we should've never invented. Fuck it I'm living in the goddamn woods and starting a commune where we ritualistically destroy internet modems. I fucking hate this stupid shit and hope to God people's behavior on the internet doesn't start leaking into the real world because if so we're all fucked. Anyways there's a rant about the internet that's probably been made a thousand times, I don't feel better, but if anyone wants to suggest some positive place for film stuff where people aren't assholes that'd be really cool and I will appreciate you. Sorry if this is dumb, I realize people post stuff here that is ten times more serious and real then this but I didn't really know where else to go, and a lot of these feelings have been making me feel hopeless and depressed, I guess I just need a break from the internet",21Nov2019,1

Around 6th grade i really noticed that I had a very hard time understanding in class, I would sit there and pay attention, take notes and it was like whatever I was trying to learn would go through one ear and out. I had the hardest time ever trying to even remember the lesson or understand. I was so embarrassed by it, i felt like a failure, it sucked all these kids would have outstanding grades. I started to give up because I was too damn embarrassed to ask anyone for help, I was scared that I would be considered a idiot or get made fun, and even with my parents I was too ashamed that I was not smart any bit. I started to notice as the years went on the more I could not sit in my seat any longer, and the more I needed to get up. I really struggled with having to sit through something where we couldn’t move and I also would talk everyones ears off, I am sure I was a distraction to them but I could not keep my mouth closed, I felt the need to comment on everything in the moment. That’s where I struggled with ADHD in school, on the outside of school i notice that I need to do a lot in a day to feel satisfied, meaning I need to be up doing something. I shake my leg a lot all the time and I don’t even realize i’m doing that, I chew my nails until they are bleeding because they are so short. My mood switches a lot I go from SO happy to the point where I literally tell myself I want to be dead right now. and it’s over things that are such a small deal, I get anxious about my friend not replying fast enough, movies, driving, being in the same position or place for too long, the way I sleep, and a shit ton more. Anyway i’ve noticed that lately I lie a lot and it’s about stuff that doesn’t need to be lied about but I lie because I think that’s what they want to hear. and then when I get called out I have a extremely hard time being honest. And it’s getting worse, I feel like I lie about shit without even realizing. I want to get better and not do this. I don’t want to hurt my close ones and I don’t want to throw my life away. I need help on ways that I can work on what I am going through. I want to get the help now before it’s too late and I completely screwed myself over and others. I don’t want to hurt anyone but my lying does because I’m doing it to people who love me and have gave me the world and it’s so disrespectful and selfish of me. I feel disgusted by myself.

72,"Sorry it's a bit rambling and I'm on mobile.

It still doesn't feel real but I'm on day 3 of my indefinite suspension and feel like I'm falling into a pit. For context, whenever I have an anxiety attack I tend to hit things, not in a ""I want to break it"" way but in a ""my chest is burning with all this emotion and I need to get it out"" way.

So about 2 weeks ago I had a stressful day at work (on top of it being a bad month mentally due to an event I just got done working) where my actions were criticized and I was told I would not be considered for a promotion I worked this 2 month event to get, after that conversation my shift was over so I went to leave, but realized I still had keys on me so I went back to my area to hand them off.

Random context but my job provides the uniform and you can either change onsite in the locker rooms everyday or take it home, but seasonal wear (i.e. jackets, rain coats) stay on property and are supposed to be turned in at the end of your shift. This day was cold so I had a jacket, emptied out the pockets at the end of my shift and turned it in before realizing I had the keys on me. Afterwards when I got to my car I realized I was missing the case to my wireless headphones and figured I somehow missed them when checking my pockets, at this point it had been about 40 minutes since I had turned the jacket in but I decided to run back in and see if it could be recovered. I went in to talk to the person in the drop off area, explained what happened and they were like ""oh, I already sent those to be washed"" so I asked if there was anything that could be done to recover the case since it hasn't been all that long but was met with a very apathetic no. This, unfortunately, was the straw that broke the camel's back, I felt my chest tighten and knew I was about to have an anxiety attack so I decided to just leave. However on my journey out I couldn't stop my self from hitting a cabinet, a door, kicking an atm (which broke my toe) and smacking a tv when I was aiming for the wall by it.

I had the following week off so I went to a doctor for my foot and my anxiety since this is the worst it's been in years, got put on Prozac and referred to a psychiatrist. The week ends and I go back to work, I noticed the tv I hit is missing but think nothing of it and go about my day. About an hour before the end of my shift I get approched by a duo who ask me to go with them to another office, they ask about my foot so I told them an abridged story of the attack, after which they inform me I'm being investigated for destroying company property. They have me fill out a statement of my side of things and inform me I'll be suspended until the investigation is complete. If things go in my favor I'll be compensated for the missed shifts, if not I'm fired.

So here I am, barely sleeping wondering if I should just start applying elsewhere or if the fact that it wasn't malicious destruction can save my job all while periodically crying because I've had this job for 5 years and actually enjoy working it. A part of me hopes that I won't get fired because the situation was mental illnesses related and the company won't want to risk legal action but the other part of me feels like they wouldn't hesitate to risk it and I'm not sure there would be legal action for me to take.

TL;DR
Had an anxiety attack leaving work and damaged a tv before going on vacation. When I returned I got suspended, placed under investigation for destroying company property and might lose my job over it.",21Nov2019,1

78,"I know that positive thinking can cure a depressed one. But now the only thing that bothers me is my numb brain. I can barely make sense from what I find good and bad. Its like my personality left me and im exposed to nothingness.

It has gone so far that everything seems to lack context and I can't make sense to others decisions. I feel left behind all other peoples experiences and im begining to get used to it. Another problem however is that everyone thinks im being stuck in my own thoughs and just lack empathy. I was diagnosed with aspergers before I started to lose understanding of what is going on around me.

So when I try to explain how I feel everyone including my family seems to assume that its my autism that is the problem and im just making up my other mental health problems since its my way to cope with not understanding others emotions. But I didn't have a problem with understanding them before I got emotionally numb. Its true that im diagnosed with aspergers and that I have problems with socializing. But I think a lot of it has to do with how my parents raised me. Both my parents seemed to have mental health problems themselves when I grew up and I never felt a connection with them. I did find others outside of my family relatable but was too anxious to open up. My parents never seemed to know the real me and just assumed that it was my autism that was the reason why I was so quiet.

So now when I try to open up about my emotional numbness they secretly seem to be hooked on the though that im just making up excuses for my lack of understanding in social situations. At least thats what it seems like when they say that ""its no big deal and that its just how things are""",21Nov2019,1
79,"this year has been so miserable and so has been this week. im so fucking exhausted and dead inside, death would be my ideal present right now.

from the moment i woke up i wanted to cut my body up. it isnt right. itll never be right for any of us. im in so much pain and so are my alters being trapped in this mistake of a body. 

this is usually my favorite time of year but the school have ruined everything by causing havoc and getting me kicked out because i was finished with being harassed.

i dont have the heart to tell my friends. im only there for them.

i wish more people hated my guts and wanted me dead so that i could die without hurting anyone.

but no, because i care too much about people and because i value everyone else over myself and i only live to serve and deal with their pain, i cant leave. i cant be free.

im not allowed to hurt people.

but god help me i feel like such a miserable failure.

this has been a horrible week and 10 hours in, a horrible birthday. i dont see why i even woke up this morning.

i wish id died in my sleep.

i hate being trapped here, being so desperate to leave and so suicidal but not allowed to die.

dying would make me so much happier...

because lifes never going to get better and i know it. its going to get worse and worse until i die. it already is.

i dont have a future, im in an alternative school now, no place would hire me simply because of that fact alone. i know it.

it feels like no matter what happens its all going to get worse.

and my brain is killing me with my alphabet soup of problems.

i shouldve died when i was younger and had the chance, everything feels so wrong now. i shouldnt be here and i can feel it..

85,"Now I know everyone could argue that their boss is a narcissist to an extent, but my experience may be a little different. I have been working for this company for 4 years, and in the 4 years that I have been here, my mental health has drastically deteriorated. I am going to try and avoid sounding like this post is one big pity party, but this is my narrative in the most honest light possible. 

I work for a small business, it's just me and the ""owner"" of the company. I use the term ""owner"" loosely because she's a trust-fund kid and her mother is the actual owner who gave her the business. 

In the past, we've attempted to employ more people to help me out with my workload, as I do EVERYTHING aside from manage our social media accounts, but these employees never lasted more than a month or two before resigning. So eventually she gave up trying to employ anyone, saying that people just aren't trustworthy. 

To the best of my ability, for the past 4 years, I have tried not to take being degraded by her too personally, chalking it down to a simple case of cognitive dissonance, etc. But things are getting all the more difficult to handle as time goes by, as it seems that my tolerance for this type of behaviour has worn thin. I am constantly having emotional outbursts at work, where I need to excuse myself and hide in the bathroom until I can get myself to stop crying as I physically cannot control this. I am constantly taking Xanax at work just to keep as calm as possible and cope with everything going on. 

You might ask why I haven't just left and moved on to another job - this does not have an easy answer, but basically jobs are hard to come by where I'm from and I also signed an agreement to pay back the company should I leave before 2 years of them sending me to complete various short courses, so that I can do certain things for the business, which means we wouldn't have to outsource these services anymore - and I simply cannot afford to repay them at this point. 

That being said, I did end up resigning in September this year as I received a job offer from a different company for a much better salary. I had been underpaid since starting at this company, and was always made to feel like this is normal as it's such a small business, so this was a relief. No matter, she counter-offered with a better offer, so I decided to stay as the other job also came with a lot of negatives that I was worried I would be accept at the time purely because of my desperation to leave and make more money.  

Now if ever there was some sort of ""mercy"" there is none now. Now I am being paid a reasonable amount which means she is not holding back on anything. 

A little bit about the person I work for, to give you an idea of what I'm actually on about. She's unlike any person I have ever ALLOWED into my life, she likes to refer to herself as simply being too honest, I see it as her being a mean girl and a bully (not just towards me, this is all referring to her in general). 

As she doesn't have much of a reason to come into the office, because she has nothing to do, she usually brings her crossfit friends over to come around ""for tea"" which means that I (someone who already battles with body dysmorphia which I have told her about before) am forced to sit and listen to them break down each individual at their gym, talk about the person's eating disorders and/or accuse them of having eating disorders, and just generally talk about what horrible people they are. This is a normal occurrence that takes place on a weekly basis. Another example of her bothersome behaviour is her obsession with her self-image. I cannot stress enough how every single decision she makes, not only in her personal life, but also for our business, comes down to her own vanity and how it will benefit her directly (these decisions usually cost the business an exorbitant amount of money) to the extend that our accountant (who is also her sister) is forced to lie about budgets just to stop her from overspending and seeing the business bleed money as it has in the past many times over. 

She treats me as if I am a lesser human being, I suppose because I'm forced to earn an honest living as I unfortunately have not been given the same opportunities in life as she has. She will interrupt whatever I am busy with at work, to ask me to go outside with her and take pictures of her for her Instagram, whilst everyone in our business park stares awkwardly and confused. She will also gladly interrupt anything I am busy with to ask me to do personal favours (I am in no way a personal assistant and do not get paid for PA duties) and silly things like asking me to get up to fetch her phone because she doesn't feel like getting up from her chair (I am not kidding, this happens often). 

I couldn't possibly get into all the detail of the all the things she does to break other people down while securing her position as a superior human being, there are simply too many things to mention. 

I suppose I am just asking for some advice, on how others would deal with this type of emotional terrorism (a bit hyperbolic but I'm slightly fed-up) and I suppose, in a way to confirm that this is NOT a norm no matter where you work.

Also, I apologise if this post seems a bit all over the place.",21Nov2019,1
86,"I have a habit of talking out loud (and in my own head to a lesser degree) constantly, mainly when no one is around. I have multiple conversations daily with people who are not there - for example, I'll be sitting on my bed and giving an ""interview"" about some fictional achievement. In almost all cases the conversations are 'positive' in the sense of me pretending to be someone better or different than I am. I do also answer myself when conversing, in another character. I am aware of what I'm doing, and that has led me to also have have conversations where I pretend to be a psychologist who is diagnosing myself about talking to myself. So I talk to myself about talking to myself. And so on, there are countless other examples. It's daily, and pretty constant. I sometimes wonder if someone could be a fly on the wall and listen in on my daily routine...they might label me as mentally ill.

87,"I’m currently sulking in bed and I hope it’s ok to post this here bcus I don’t know where else it belongs :)

So I live with my younger brother &amp; bf and I’ve been recovering from social anxiety / gad / agoraphobia &amp; depression and am diagnosed with bpd also. 

Started going to the gym 2 years ago and it was great for my mood. Coming from someone who spent most of the day in bed or on the sofa and never going outside ever this improved my mood and obviously started functioning a bit better but honestly my mood fluctuates a whole lot so most days i just don’t have it in me to do anything.


I should clean but I just spend 45 mins cleaning the bathroom and I still have 4 other rooms to do.. (it’s not super messy or anything but I hate clutter and if I clean I clean properly like I won’t stop cleaning the shower door until there are 0 watermarks lol) but I can’t do this every day and no one helps me with fucking anything so it just gets left until I force myself to clean it all over again. I know I don’t work but I’m sick of looking after everybody and doing everything 


How am I supposed to function normally when I have to spend hours cleaning and am so tired by the end I can’t force myself outside to walk 45 mins to the gym and then 45 mins back after because I don’t drive and can’t use public transport.  then I have to come back and cook separate dinners cause no one eats the same fucking thing so I don’t even cook for myself now I just microwave something or snack or eat nothing. THEN ALL THE DISHES ARE LEFT TO ME THE NEXT DAY CAUSE NOONE WILL DO THEM EVEN IF I ASK. my hands are so dry and whenever I touch cleaning stuff without gloves they get red and itchy and horrible and still no one helps 


and then I’ve spend all day trying to look after myself and other people I’m tired and just want to sit and watch tv or do nothing but I have to spend time with my boyfriend playing games or whatever when I’m so tired I can’t focus properly 


Then I go to bed AND CANT SLEEP BECAUSE MY BODY IS HATEFUL or if I do I’m STILL TIRED WHEN I WAKE UP.  or my bf keeps me awake cause he snores so damn loud and If I’m not sleep before he comes to bed there is literally no hope and I go sleep on the sofa and get harassed by my cats all night


THEN THE BEST PART IS HAVING TO GET UP THE NEXT DAY AND DO IT ALL AGAIN. how am I supposed to do all this stuff and get a job?? and function normally? because I can’t and I’m stuck and I hate it",21Nov2019,1
88,"So, i just turned 20, few hours ago. At least 1/4 of my life is gone, and its gone with depression that i fight with for 5 years now. And today it eats me deep from the inside, and i don't have someone to share with no more.

When i was 15 my parents sent me to the psychologist, cuz i got troubles with people relationship in school. They lost interest after few weeks in about how i feel after all of those ""psycho-sessions"", and i never trusted to tell about them. I ""lost"" my parents since they dumped me at grade 4, i guess(I'm european, we have 12 grades at school). From grade 9 my mother turned against me, cause of the PC i was playing all day long. i understand her, honestly, but i was trying to ""hang out"" with my 2 friends from school. Games and talks. That's what really helped me, not the doc. That was the only thing that helped me not to think about all that bad stuff that was going in my life. But time floats by, and finally i pulled myself together, and expressed my feelings.

That's how i discovered love in my life. Don't know how to express my feelings, but it was a miracle. I wanted to be with her, touch her, hear her speak. There was nothing, that i wanted so bad. You might think i'm psycho? Well, maybe. I didn't know what is love(maybe still don't), cuz i never had one until this moment. She was the first person that i opened myself for. We started daiting from middle of the 10 grade. First meaningful hugs, first kiss, first drama, first argue, first make up after quarrel, and so much more. She showed me how to live, how to be joyful, how to share yourself with someone. Of course, our relationship wasn't perfect, but looking at them now we can’t remember a single serious quarrel.

And finally we made it to university. For the first time, we have not seen each other for so long, because both have things to do, it’s time to look for work, because you are 18, studies starting to rape your brain and free time. First year was difficult, but we made it through. We missed each other so much. Chats, phone calls, rare meets.  We traveled, spent time together, she said that she loves me, that I am wonderful and that she is glad to be with me, that I make her happy. 

Week ago we broke up. We haven't seen each other for month before that, cuz university and other stuff. The main reason was - she thinks our relationships are fucked up. Have you lost somebody before? I lost my granny this summer. That was the tough times. This kind of feeling, that you lost a huge part of you. You look in the coffin and understand that you will never hug, kiss, share something with this person. And it's happening again. Right now i feel like i lost life meaning. All my future plans were connected with her. And now it's gone. 

But the strangest thing is that she wants to communicate, says that she values me and that I mean a lot to her. When we talked about feelings, she never said that she no longes loved me. I do not want a relationship now. I don't want to fool myself. I do not want to cry at night. But not the words that she does not love me. She said she was running away from me for last month. She said we became strangers. I'm confused. Don't know how and what to feel. Of course, I thought about suicide, but I know that this is not an option, I know that I do not want people who are important to me to suffer and think that it is because of them. I know that she is the only one, I'm sure many felt something like that. But I don’t know how to fix it. I can not get rid of feelings. I do not want to. I do not want to push or convince that she is not right(cuz obviously i think so). But how she behaves with me after break up leaves a feeling that she still loves me. And i know she is.

Look. I'm whining again(I hope it doesn’t look like a dumb whining). Anyway, thanks for hearing me out. Peace :)",21Nov2019,1

90,"Hello, I just had a rather frustrating conversation with a friend, so I figured I would post here to get people who may agree with me.

I have an inclination to believe that mental illness is more preventable and  correctable  than most people I talk to believe.

I will give an example of what I mean:

Suppose you are a child of 4.  You grow up in a seemingly good household with 3 other siblings.  Economically fine, and living in a good neighborhood.  You have an issue with a birthmark as an early child.  Your father doesn't help you deal with it, and makes you feel bad to ask about how you deal with kids at school bullying you.  So you become reclusive.  Your entire childhood becomes more and more about hiding who you are out of fear than being like others.  Because of this, you are prone and vulnerable to even more bullying behavior from your peers.  Because you are more vulnerable, you teach yourself how to not upset anyone rather than ever having dealt with a simple issue.  So maybe this makes you a people pleaser.  As the years go by, you continue this behavior and forget how you even got to this point.  Now you are in college, and you don't even know who you are.  You aren't good with girls, you have no motivation to do anything, and now you can't even land a good job.  You become even more depressed.  You go to therapy and psychiatrists and they diagnose you with chronic depression.  You have anxiety, signs of OCD and bipolar disorder.  Now you are 30, and you feel like you missed the boat on life.  All your friends are married and you wish you were like them.  You become more depressed.  You start talking to yourself to get through the days.  You are becoming known to people as a crazy person.  You stop self care and smell like shit everywhere you go.  At 45 you are homeless and now your chances of ever establishing an identity have severely diminished.  Nobody wants to hire you, much less treat you like a normal human being.  You develop symptoms of schizophrenia.  Then you become angry with the world and nihilistic.  ""Why did this happen to me?""  At 54 you commit suicide.  You just couldn't handle it anymore.

All your friends and family come to your funeral and just chalk it up to mental illness.

Little did they know that what you were struggling with was practical and curable and not just some unfortunate disease.

Does anyone else feel this is more realistic for what mental illness is?

Its a very broad and general timeline of events, I was trying to convey the general gist of the source of ""mental illness"".

I believe this to be mostly true and it INFURIATES me.  It really just come down to people being loving to others at all times and caring about them.  I mean caring enough to do something about it.

Anyone else feel the same way?",21Nov2019,1

92,"So my gf and I of 11 ish months recently went through a break up, and got back together after a few weeks. She’s a victim of narcissistic abuse, and recently she’s been doing a lot of self reflection and figuring out who she is. 

With that, more recently, she seems to have bypassed self confidence and self love, and gone straight to “My way or the highway.” She’s showing some improvement, but she still has a hard time accepting my emotions if they conflict with something she wants. 

She also seemed to think that some of my boundaries were manipulative or abusive. For example, I’m more monogamous than she is, and because we agreed to monogamy from the beginning I told her it was non-negotiable. Or after the break up, I told her that I don’t do friendships with serious exes, and to stop contacting me if she wanted to break up. Did I hope she’d miss me and think twice? Absolutely, but I was dead serious about moving on if I had to, and I’m currently 4500 miles away. She can do whatever she wants. Stay and respect my boundaries, or don’t and move along.

99,"Context: I don’t want to self diagnose myself but I’ve been through childhood trauma and technically I’ve been prescribed with ptsd and anxiety disorder meds but I’ve never really talked to my doctor in depths about my trauma because I came in for my anxiety, I’ve only said to her “I’ve had a traumatic event happened to me as a kid”  when she asked about it for  my anxiety. 

But recently I’ve been getting really stuck in my thoughts. To the point where I have to snap myself out of it. At first I would just bite my finger but then that stopped working. Then I started screaming to snap myself out of it and it got really bad to the point where I randomly screamed in front of my group of friends. Then I started banging my head on things or hitting and scratching myself. I still do all of this now.

But recently I knocked myself unconscious and woke up with a bruise on my face and I started to realize this is getting out of control. 

My thoughts are usually a mix of things I regret doing, embarrassing stuff and hating myself. I’ve tried so hard to talk to myself and try to let these things go but the thoughts keep coming back, making me do more embarrassing things to stop myself from thinking about it. 

I tried to search it up but I feel like I’m alone. The closest thing I ever came up with was NSSI (non suicidal self injury) but I noticed it was mainly about cutting, which I’ve done a long time ago, but not for this reason.

I have been seeking help but all the therapists I have encountered cost way too much. There are so many choices that it gets overwhelming and I just stop looking. I almost thought of having myself committed yesterday just so I could get some help.  

I really need help. I'm afraid to make new friends in that I'll screw up again. Any suggestions where I can find a cheaper alternative or a place that offers cheap help?",21Nov2019,1
106,"I'm a spirituality awakened Genz guy with an IQ of 140 who grew up watching and absorbing nerdy/geeky content. Constant information/knowledge explosions have made me realise that this world is not designed for humans. I suffered from OCD, depression and anxiety which ruined my career. Feels like life is meaningless and we live in a world full of violence and persecution. Our favorite celebrities and idols killing themselves, families giving up on each other and zero humanity. Do we have a future? I can sense the reason behind every individuals actions yet I feel powerless. Someone is celebrating their honeymoon in Paris while a kid is getting butchered by mexican cartels, while a guy starves to death in Africa and a kid is fighting for a bigger piece of birthday cake with his sister. Is it fair? 
Have our elders ruined this world where we don't have a future? Can anyone else relate?",21Nov2019,1

I have my own mental health problems along with chronic pain. So I have been through a lot and handled a lot. But now I am heartbroken. None of my usual coping mechanisms are working and I feel like the pain is coming at me like tide. Pain then a small slip back and it smashes down on me all over again. 

Every little thing is upsetting me. I understand he needs to be there to get better and patients go through angry phases. But my anxiety is screaming he wont forgive me. My heart hurts all I want to do is be there and help. I dont know what to do with myself its invading my everything.",21Nov2019,1

I went to a psychiatrist to get help. Was diagnosed with MDD and GAD. Got my medication and was ready to try and get better. But my depression and anxiety got the better of me again. I stopped taking meds, and going to the psychiatrist. Barely shower, brush my teeth. Deleted all my social media, and have stopped going out.

Recently I got into cutting. Scratching my thigh with a scalpel repeatedly for the high. I hate it. I hate doing it. But I can’t help it. After the first cut I started getting more into it. But I don’t want to do it.

I don’t want to disappoint my friends or family. And I know a lot of them don’t understand mental health. So I’m scared they’ll tell me that I just have to stop. Or I’m worried people will think I’m insane. And my friends are going through their own struggles, so I don’t want to burden them with my stupid issues.

But trying to get better alone is so hard. I know my friends will understand. My family probably won’t.

113,"Hello,  
I have tried communicating this feeling for ages but it's happening again and now I'm writing this post as it's happen.

I was very concentrated on something, listening to something on my computer.

I suddenly started feeling ""it"":

It feels as if someone else is talking in my thoughts (not voices) but as if another part of my thoughts are suddenly turned on and are almost thinking something else. It's really distracting and I also ""feel"" it. Like right now I'm listening to music and it feels like my thoughts are going contrary to the music? As if they are judging me in way. These thoughts always seem to have this same attitude: angry and frustrated and like sarcastic?

It's hitting particularly strong as I am writing this, i can't describe it. Like my perception of reality is really messed up right now, I feel like I would struggle to have a conversation.

In way I feel quite detached from reality and as if my thoughts are not really mine, I'm not entirely sure that I am typing this but I know I am. Gosh I feel like i'm completely a machine.

 I've never been diagnosed with anything or have ever ever discovered what this is. Whenever I have it, I can know what it is but when it stops I cannot understand at all what it.

It hasn't done it in really quite a while.

It feels as if my thoughts are being dragged away by something in my head? Everything becomes really strange and I have to say I can stay concentrated on tasks really easily but in a machine like way. I am typing this while my ""other"" thoughts are going in completely the other way.

This is really strange... 

Sorry this post is ridiculous but I would really like to hear if someone else experiences this sort of thing.

Cheers :)",21Nov2019,1
114,"Hi! This is my first post ever and I don't really think that I know how Reddit works, but I wanna try (and apologize in advance for any dumbness). So, the point is that 6 years ago, I had an accident that bassically made my left arm fold backwards, and doctors were disscusing if they should or not cut my arm off. Finally they realized my arm could be saved; I went trough a surgery and lots of fisical rehab, but ever since then I feel that this arm is not mine anymore, and that I will eventually lose it, not that I want it, but I feel it's gonna happen no matter what, and that all this years since the accident has been just like extra-time to enjoy it. I've been told that this is dysmorphia disorder or posttraumatic stress syndrome, what do you think? I want some opinions because haven't gone with a psychologist yet, but I will go in a few weeks and I want to have an idea beforehand... Thanks!",21Nov2019,1
115,"For years now I have been unable to feel positive emotions, only in breif, spontanious bursts and it feel like a constant struggle just to get by a day without dark thoughts. Anyways, I felt like a could at least make the best of this condition and started to practice photography in some of my sleep deprived nights. It's something to do I guess and at least it keeps me active but I don't really have anything else to do aside from than that.

My question is, has anyone felt something similar to this? What can you do to fill those moments of emptiness?",21Nov2019,1
116,"Here’s some background: I’m in a great relationship with my boyfriend, we love each other so much and have great plans for our future. But we both struggle with mental illness. He has major depression and I have bad anxiety as well as depression. We’re both on medication and are working to find medication that helps. But it’s constantly a struggle to stay afloat. He is struggling more than I am I think because he sleeps in almost every day and missed his morning classes. He doesn’t have motivation to do anything and is forgetful of a lot of things. He told me he feels like everyone is disappointed in him and he’s disappointed in himself. I try to tell him that I’m proud and that’s he’s doing his best. But I often get frustrated with him and feel he’s not trying. But of course he’s trying and I just need to be more patient. I struggle with this guilty feeling that when ever I’m getting better he feels more down on himself because I can do things better than he can. And I don’t want him to feel that way so I don’t try to get better as much as I should. I shared this with my therapist and she shared a great analogy with me: when you’re on a plane and there’s an emergency, the oxygen masks come down who do they say you need to put the mask on first? Yourself. And why is that? Because you might not have time to put it on someone else before you black out. This really put things in perspective because I need to get better for me and him or else I’m going to fall down too. Which is no help to him either. This may seem like a no brainer to some people but my mind just doesn’t think that way with my anxiety. I feel hopeful and ready to get better now knowing that it’s what really gonna make us both better. 

TLDR: I was guilty about getting better because my boyfriend is doing much worse than me. My therapist told me that when you’re on an airplane and the oxygen masks come down you put it on yourself before another person because you may not have time before you blackout. Simple but very impactful for me.",21Nov2019,1
117,"I'm so exhausted that I can barely function. I hit snooze on my alarm every single morning and wake up at the last possible moment because I literally cannot get out of bed even though I average 8-9 hours of sleep per night.  On the weekends, if I don't have anything  on my schedule, I will sleep 12+ hours and wake up extremely exhausted and usually I will wake up and eat breakfast or take a shower and I end up being so exhausted that I end up needing to go back to bed.

One of my biggest passions in life is cooking and I have only cooked 1 meal at home in the past 10 months. I just have been too tired to grocery shop, cook, and then deal with the dishes that inevitably will sit in my sink for weeks because I have to lay down when I get home from work. As a result, I have been eating more fast food and have gained about 70 pounds over the past 2 years. My weight typically does fluctuate, but I'm currently at the highest weight I have ever been.

I used to work a very physically and mentally exhausting job (for me at least...I am very introverted and hate conflict, and I was the GM at a cafe where I had to deal with complaining customers and flaky high school employees 60-80 hours per week. I changed jobs about a year and a half ago and my new job is way more relaxed and is very consistent, M-F 9am-5pm on the dot, which has been amazing. I thought I would feel more rested with time, but things have not changed.

Here's some backstory on my health history to help give some more information. I have Hashimoto's and take generic synthroid daily. I recently got blood work done to see if they could increase my dose because I'm so tired. The results came back normal but they let me increase my dosage to 75mcg 4 days and week and 150mcg 3 days a week.  I still feel exhausted and to be honest, I don't notice a difference when I'm taking it vs. when I'm not.

I also started seeing a psychiatrist about a year ago for social anxiety. I started off taking Escitalopram and was then changed to Desvenlafaxine after the results from my Genesight test came back saying that I wouldn't respond as well to Escitalopram. I was also given Propranolol for times when I am doing something like public speaking. He asked me once how much I feel better percentage wise and I said 30%. He seemed really surprised and caught off guard. To be honest, my real answer would have been 0%, but any improvement I feel is because I'm finally doing something about how I feel instead of staying quiet about it. After I said I only felt 30% better (about 6 months ago) I was changed to Duloxetine and was also given Alprazolam. I still feel the same and to be honest, can't tell that I'm even on medication except for the fact that if I miss a day, I get dizzy. 

When I relayed this information to a couple of family members, they responded back with something along the lines of ""that's a good thing you don't notice anything, it means you don't have a chemical imbalance"" but I just don't think that's true. My family has never openly discussed mental health and they don't understand the complexities. My generation of cousins are the first people who are seeking help for anything -- I have a cousin who was diagnosed as bipolar and also another cousin on the other side of the family who is seeking help for anxiety and depression. My dad's father committed suicide when my dad was one year old and his family never talked about it and my dad didn't even see a picture of him until we were cleaning out my grandma's house to move her to a nursing home. 

Anyways -- sorry for the long post but I just wanted to share as much information as I could. Is it normal to feel this way? What advice do you have on what I should do next? Feel free to ask any questions to get more information on my situation. Thank you!",21Nov2019,1

119,"So, just to disclaim, I used fake names for my story in case my ""friend"" finds this, as well as to protect my close friend's identity. Though he might end up finding out that it was me by reading this anyway but honestly don't care. 

I have this “friend” called Jeremy. I knew him for two and a half years and was pretty close to him. He got married last year with one of my closest friends, Jessica. They split last May and is officially getting a divorce next month. Since then, he has been lying and manipulating about Jessica and has been trying to sabotage the relationship between me and my mates, and Jessica.

Last year, before they split up, we were on a night out during Christmas time and I stayed in town as they both promised me that I could stay during the night. We were already quite drunk and Jessica was very emotional that night and me, Jeremy and Jessica were in this club. Both of them are in a polyamorous relationship and this guy was interested in Jessica. Jeremy tried to get with someone else but didn’t get lucky so he went home early because he was jealous of her. As the club was closing we were heading out when at one point I turn away for a second. And she was gone. 

I look around the area and was nowhere to be found, so I head back to their flat and find Jeremy. At that point, I was already having a panic attack and I told him that she was missing. He ended up somewhat force me to leave as he went inside and destroyed some of her stuff. Having nowhere to go and my friend missing, I had a mental breakdown on their doorstep.

I was on the floor for at least half an hour until I tried searching around town looking for her. After four hours, I couldn’t handle the cold rain and wind. I was able to get the bus back but I couldn’t get warm until I got home. 

I ended up having PTSD from that night, I still suffer from it as well. I could have even died. Jessica could have died as well. The worse thing about it wasn't the fact that I was left in the cold, but the fact that I worried that she was in danger or even worse.

I have to still hang around with him only because most of my friends hang out with him. Some of them don’t see Jessica anymore because Jeremy told them lies and manipulate them to believe him. He even says that he has PTSD himself because he claims that she abused him when really he has done things that are much worse as he raped her. He also hacked her emails and has been texting her new boyfriend with abuse claims, which they ended up going to the police about it. The worst thing about it is that I can’t open up about that night to most of my mates, especially with him in the same room. 

I have told Jessica about that night as well as my PTSD, she the only one who knows as well as one other friend of mine, which he doesn't know about the PTSD since I told him the night after that it happened. I usually get triggers when I'm cold outside, which has been bad over the past few weeks because of the winter. But I recently discovered that the triggers can be prevented by listening to music, which keeps me distracted while being outside. 

For so long, I blamed myself for that night. Even though I still blame myself for losing her, Jeremy should have helped me find her or let me stay in the house. I am planning on leaving him by the end of the year though. I’m done with his lies and I’m done with him breaking my mind.",21Nov2019,1
120,"Hey guys, I've been struggling with intrusive suicidal thoughts for almost a decade now, but it's gotten significantly worse as I've just applied to medical school and have yet to hear back. I'm still in school pursuing a graduate degree and the pressure is mounting on me to figure out what I need to do now that I am almost 27 years old and medical school may not be a reality for me.

I know that I'm still young and I've got time, but what I need right now is for some advice on how to shake these intrusive thoughts while I'm trying to study for exams and such. There's a subconscious chant in my head that says ""You should die"" and ""You should just kill yourself"", sometimes the voice shifting to first person ""I should die"", ect ect. Sometimes this materializes into plotting my own suicide, but I generally have no intent on following through.

121,"26F, I have made this account just to ask your guys opinion on if I should be seen or current meds adjusted. I have questioned myself a couple of times wondering if I should maybe bring it up to my doctor about being mildly bipolar, but I have been to nervous. I was diagnosed with depression &amp; anxiety when I was in middle school, I take daily meds for both. Recently life has been busy &amp; stressful, well some days I find myself freaking out about things I need to get done &amp; I plan on doing them... sometimes I follow through &amp; sometimes I end up just being a lazy asshole. There are some days/weeks where I feel confident with myself, then there are times I hate how I look &amp; everything about me.  There was a week recently were my libido was super high, then I felt like the middle of next week it went downhill again, which isn’t fair to my SO. Then it makes me depressed cause I feel bad that he’s not getting it as much as I would like to give.

I find it hard to wake up in the morning &amp; get my ass out of bed… I feel that I fall asleep to early at night as well so there should be no reason to be tired in the morning. I’m such a homebody, don’t want to do anything or hangout with anyone. Also, I find myself not interested or enjoying my hobbies, then other times I can’t stop talking about it or enjoying that hobby. Sometimes I can talk someone’s ear off then other times people are asking me if I’m okay cause I don’t talk much or just have an unhappy look on my face... I also always think of the negative in every situation. 

Please no negative comments, I’m just asking to see if maybe I need my depression/anxiety meds adjusted or if I need to be seen. Just looking for advice also! 

Thank you all in advance!",21Nov2019,1
122,"My dad called me the other day to tell me some news, my molester brother was coming to Christmas with his partner and my Dad was wondering if I would be able to handle it ‘without making a scene’. ‘Everyone will be there including (sisters boyfriend)’. ‘It would mean a lot to mom to have all of her children under one roof.’ He continued, \*\*’before grandpa died he said, “all I want is peace in the family”, and that’s what I want.\*\*

My brother used violence to coerce me to commit sexual acts on him from the time i was 5-14 and he was 11-20.

On the morning of my first interview with the police my dad took me to breakfast at my favour restaurant in our small town, where he said, “you can either put your brother in jail, or you can keep the family together.” I lied to the police, told them I didn’t want to talk about it. The investigation went away. My parents never punished Nick, when the investigation was over they let him pick any city in the US and they would help him move there. He picked NYC. That was 11 years ago.

Ive kept my silence to keep the family together. My parents keep reminding me in our bi/trimonthly family fights that ‘there was nothing we could do.’ and \*\*‘there will be no more family if you keep up with this.’\*\*

My brother is always playing the saint and they just fawn over how success and accomplished he is. He’s seen as the darling helper who could do no wrong.

Whenever I try to talk to my family about what he did they tell me, ‘Tell your therapist that, not us.’

In my Mom and I’s most recent fights, she let out a tirade of ‘why didn’t you tell me it was happening? why didn’t you tell me one time?’ And then followed that up with, ‘When I was a little girl I prayed to God that I would have kids, but now after all of this I wish I Never was a Mom.’

I have been trying to go NC with my brother but my family doesn’t seem to respect that. I often get texts from him in the family group text saying overly positive shit like nothings up. He’s coming to Christmas, and my parents wanted me to go on a trip with everyone else including him and his girlfriend where I would be expected to ‘Not make a scene.’

I need some sort of grounding because I’ve been keeping quiet with this hell of family and rape for 21 years, first so my brother wouldent get in trouble, and secondly so my parents wouldent look bad to their family and friends.

The biggest hypocrisy of this is that I was sexually abused as a child by another perpetrator. A older man who abused me for 2 years concurrently with the time I was being abused at home. I told my mom what had happened, he then was charged and convicted and sentenced to jail. I had my parents full support then. I told my parents about this man abusing me in particular first so they would know how to handle my brother. Turns out they didn’t. I am still glad I told them in that order, because if I had told them about my brother and then the older man they would have covered up both, and I likely would have killed myself from the stress that I otherwise barely survived.

123,"I think I've been doing this my whole life. I feel sorry for people over really arbitrary things, and serious things don't bother me at all.

My city has a huge homeless population. I see homeless people all the time. They're hungry, cold, and a lot of them are sick. It doesn't really bother me.

On the other hand, I saw two old guys hanging out at Dairy Queen one night eating burgers and I felt really sorry for them. Nothing was unfortunate about this. Two guys were just hanging out. I don't know why I was feeling sorry for it.

It might be that they looked really sensitive+innocent, and I imagined someone shaming them for eating GMOs and factory farmed meat. That would have been awful but it didn't happen. It wouldn't happen. No one would do that. I didn't have this thought, but something like that might have caused it subconsciously.

I also tend to feel really sorry for people over trivial little things. This one guy wanted to play cards with my friends but we didn't have time since we had to go to a movie. I remember crying about this later that night.

I feel really sorry over little things and people have actually abused this. It has happened on multiple occasions that someone who had been really mean (I'm talking, unforgivably mean by most people's standards) to me said a few things that made me feel too guilty to stay mad at them.

She hangs out a lot in my dorm that is shared with 3 other people who are also close friends with her. Sometimes she stays in our dorm for hours and vents about what's going on and just lays down on our carpet. I'm glad that she feels comfortable to share this with us, but (I don't want to sound rude), sometimes my roommates and I need our own space too. Also, I want to be a good friend and be there for her, but listening to her for hours takes a lot of energy from me (I try to make her laugh and I actively listen) and during that time I'm not productive with my schoolwork at all because I need to be there for her and it'd be awkward if I were to do homework while she cries in my room.

128,"It’s becoming more apparent that individuals are seeking self-validation from online platforms, there have been many studies showing there has been a significant rise in body dysmorphia, eating disorders and other mental health issues.

These platforms have also worryingly become a dangerous place, communities encouraging vulnerable individuals to practice dangerous and unsafe behaviours.

Instagram has done a few things in order to make its platform safe for individuals such as putting in sensitivity screens in place. Recently they have [banned cosmetic surgery filters](https://screenshot-magazine.com/trend/instagram-bans-filters/) after the rise in body dysmorphia. 

Whilst I really believe this is positive step in the right direction. I still, however, think that social media platforms should be working with mental health organisations and charities to prevent more and make social media a really safe place for people.

129,"Whenever I try to communicate my thoughts and feelings there is like this barrier between me and the right words. Like I’m thinking and I feel like I know what I’m trying to say but I just can’t reach the words, like they are blocked and I just start gesturing. 

I don’t sing or draw or paint or dance either so it’s very hard for me to express myself effectively. Writing is the easiest form of communication for me because I can think for a really long time about how I want to piece together what I’m trying to say, sometimes it still doesn’t feel like I got my point across.

134,"So my younger sister (16) had a talk with me 2 days ago about how she thinks she might be bipolar. Now listen, she doesn't try to diagnose herself with anything (her words) but she got curious since she felt really weird mentally for a long time, and did some research to see if she might be depressed, and to her it seems like what she feels and does is very similar to what BD patients are like. Things like being either extremely happy for up to a week and then suddenly feeling really irritated over stupid things, thoughts of death and ""not wanting to exist"", and this has been going on since she was 14 or at least that's what she remembers. 

The problem is, our mother is badly educated on mental health, and the things she sometimes says are so absurd I don't even want to mention them. My sister lives with her and she tried to explain how she feels but all she got back was ""what are you? A psychopath?? You're not sick, you don't need therapy!"",and even though I'm an adult myself, I'm not her legal guardian so I can't take her myself. And to add to that therapy where we live is extremely expensive. I had to work many hours to get enough money to spend on it and get properly diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. 

I really want to help my sister, I don't know how, we both tried all we could, and the stuff she's going through right now is the same stuff I was going through at her age with my anxiety before I was legally an adult.

138,"Hi All,

I've just got a quick question for you. I've been feeling pretty different the past few months, and I'm not sure if it justifies seeing psychological help or not. I am **NOT** asking for a diagnosis. There's a waitlist to see the counselors/psychiatrists at my university and I don't want to deny someone care that needs it.  


Over the past few months I have:

* Been having constant feelings that I'm not smart enough for my degree, and my grades have been dropping lower than ever before. I know that I *need* to be working harder, but I still leave everything last minute. 
* The only time I don't feel completely under-qualified is when I'm at the gym
* I find it really hard to pay attention during lectures, especially for the subjects that I don't care about. I also get super distracted when doing homework.
* Oppositely, I can sit down and program for 6 hours without any breaks, and I really enjoy it. I wish I could handle all my other subjects like I do Computer Science. 
* Some days I feel incredibly depressed, but then I feel completely fine for the rest of the week. 
* Constantly tired/Apathetic unless I have caffeine.

Are these a normal part of the human experience that I should just tough out, or should I seek help?

Thank you!",21Nov2019,1
139,"Yes, you can say that, just don't think about it, get busy, but it's not as simple as it seems.
This bullshit I have began quite long, still in childhood. One evening I lay in the village and tried to sleep. And then I feel the urge to go to the toilet. Descended. Then another. And more. And then he began to feel an unpleasant sensation in the abdomen. We went to the hospital with my dad (I was 10 years old), I drank pills, nothing passed and I forgot about it. Yeah, I just forgot and everything was okay.
Then (through 3 year) such a bullshit began with breathing, then appeared unpleasant sensations in the hands of, feet. Now I'm 14, it was a year ago. And I thought that this has already happened, you just forget. I suffered until spring, and then I did not care, it was already summer, everything is cool.
But summer not endless, and began school. That's where it all started again, these feelings, they are tolerable, but this background drives me crazy. I have an obsession that I'm not healthy.
It is worth saying that my parents are very strict, I always lived with the thought ""and Vanya has good parents, they do not beat him probably"", they are obsessed with my studies,they start to poison me if I bring bad grades. Yes, and there was a time when my mother was booze. She does not drink, but then she had something at work, I was not educated.

140,"For some background, I'm a generally very negative person which contributes to all sorts of issues of mine.  In the past what I've found helpful was to find a buddy who, twice a day, we would exchange some kind of positive statement.  It should be ideally about ourselves, and of course no repeats.  So it's relatively easy at first to find some low hanging fruit positive statements, but then as you move on you start running out of the obvious ones and sometimes need to think a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

I always picked a buddy to do this because it keeps me accountable.  But while that's great and all, it falls apart if that buddy no longer maintains it to the same level you do, or if you argue with that friend.

141,"So I started a job last week, and I quit 7 days later. I’ve never done that before, I’m usually a very committed hard worker, but this role was absolutely not what I thought, or was sold, and the organization (it’s a charity btw) is riddled with issues everyone seems to be ignoring.

My coworker has been helping me the whole time, because my manager has not touched base with me once, which is weird because usually when you start a new employee you support them into the role. The job itself is horrendously stressful, and the last lady quit because of that - and because she was constantly working above and beyond the hours she was getting paid. Even my coworker is applying for new jobs, she’s been here 8 weeks, her predecessor also quit, or rather “gave up” because she was sick of the mess that is their office. 

My problem is, they’re making me work out my 4 weeks notice, and it’s completely flared up my depression in a very, very bad way. My boss is aware of how anxious I am, and how much I DREAD coming in each day, but told me to call a counselor with the free work service they use. The staff are nice, but their so apathetic and have their heads in the sand about the issues going on. I just don’t know how I’m going to survive the next 20 working day’s, I’m at the point of feeling suicidal again (this has been a long term thing that pops up) and I can’t get my head out of this black cloud until I’m free. My stomach hurts a lot, my skin has broken out, I’ve cried countless times in the past week and feel exhausted.

I know people who have taken it, they suffered more than gained anything, and the internet is absolutely full of people with a wide range of complaints.

Whenever I try to google alternatives, I get kumbaya, mediation, and ""just have a healthy workout"" kind of results. I'm talking alternative medications aside from dexamphetamine, that could provide similar results, but without or less ravaging health issues. I know of modafinil, but you can only get the prescription if you suffer from narcolepsy, which I could possibly suffer from, but only mildly. The process of diagnosing narcolepsy consists of being monitored multiple days in a sleep research center, which my insurance most likely won't cover, aside from the hassle of it all.

I go to no one apart from my councillor about how I’m feeling and the reason behind this is that, my parents don’t get it!!! They don’t get what it’s like to be me and they think because they went through similar things, I’ll deal with things in exactly the same way, my mum especially thinks this but this is not the case!!!! The relationship with me and my mum has completely gone and before any of you start making assumptions like “maybe you’re pulling away from your mum” that is not the case, not at all and I would know if that was the case. College is fucking stressful and I’ve even had to take myself out on a walk around college and today I didn’t even go to one of my classes, I just stayed in Learning Support instead because I couldn’t handle being in a classroom with everything that’s going on with my mental health and my life at home.

149,"1. She never admits she is wrong. Today we talked about something over the phone and she said “so are you excited that your cousin is gonna visit tomorrow?” And I said “he is coming on Saturday..”  she replied “no, you told me tomorrow” so we fought about this nonsense who said what and at the end of conversation she said “I told you he is coming on Saturday and you say he will visit tomorrow” and this can go on with pretty much anything, she does this to everybody.. and at the end of conversation you just let her “win” because otherwise it can last for two hours and you end up emotionally exhausted.

2. She treats my teenage brother like a child. She tells him how to dress, when to wash, how to behave etc. Other day I picked him up from school and he had really awful hair, he looked like he is homeless. So I offered to cut his hair and he agreed. When she saw it she lost it, because it’s winter and he will be cold. Wtf. I’m concerned because she encourages him to leave school and gives him antidepressants and I really think he is ok, he just needs to move out asap. In our country doctors prescribe you anything you ask them for so you don’t bother them (awful). 

3. She always expects we will do literally everything for her. Doesn’t matter what she asks for, if we refuse she blames us and tries to make us feel bad. For example she asked my cousin (they live basically next door) to take some package to the post office. He said if he will go anywhere he will let her know. Three days later she calls me and tells me how awful he is, that she saw him leave several times and he didn’t say anything. I asked her why didn’t she go, she has drivers licence and a car and she doesn’t work. She said because he is always around post office anyway and its easier for him to do that. Like we all owe her something. 

4. She hates everyone. Always saying stuff behind people’s back, criticise everything and the worst part is - she always adds something that SHE thinks is right. I noticed people avoid her and I’m starting to realise why. When I was a child I believed her and because of that I believed that grandma and aunt are not good people. 

5. No visits-ever.  I could never invite anyone to my birthday party or just to hang out. The same is with the rest of my family. If someone comes over they have to sit out on a terrace. She is also a hoarder but never really admits, she just tells everyone that we don’t do anything around the house and she can’t manage cleaning entire house. I cleaned several times when she was away (hospital, vacation,..) and she was always mad (I didn’t threw anything out I just cleaned windows, wiped dust, threw away bad food,..). 

6. Always scares us with illnesses and accidents. Like if my toddler falls she will always say that he acts weird or that maybe he has an internal bleeding. Or if we go on a plane she keeps telling me how the plane will crash or someone in foreign country will kill us and sell our organs.

7. She needs attention. I will never forget my prom. It was awful. In our country parents are invited to dinner and we all dress up, dance, hang out and then parents go home and we party. Well we ate and everything was great, I left because we had photoshoot with our dates. When I came back she was alone sitting at the table looking all sad and angry at the same time. I asked her what was wrong and she said she can’t believe we all left her alone (rest of the family was at a bar and invited her but she didn’t want to go). I felt bad for her, couldn’t relax so I stayed with her while all of my friends had fun. And that wasn’t enough for her, because she still whined how awful my father is to leave her like that and rather drinks with my cousins. She ruined it. Luckily I was invited to another prom as a date so at least I had another, good and fun experience.

I could get help without them but it would be difficult to organise and would hurt them to know I didn't go to them first. 

There's also the matter that I keep going to say something but the words don't come out.

Anyways, lately I have been feeling socially awkward. I'm always like that, but I want to hang out with people, and sometimes I'm not invited out or I feel left out or I feel like I'd be a burden. But whenever I am at a social event, at that moment I kind of feel like the life of the party, everyone wants to talk to me, everyone is, well what I feel like, are laughing with me, I feel cool and wanted. But... when I am alone, I try to convince myself that nobody wants me around or that I won't know how to talk or be no fun at the party.

Does anybody else feel this way or is it just me? Like I know I am wanted and I'm just being paranoid trying to convince myself otherwise, but why do I feel this way? Because I hate social events or crowds, but once I start talking I feel I guess popular?",21Nov2019,1

At times I think ppl are talking about me or hate me and I have thoughts that leap beyond logic and proof but I still believe it even tho I know it makes no sense.

176,"I have been wanting to get checked out for awhile now, but don’t know how to go about it. I don’t know where to go, or what to ask.

In March of this year I saw a therapist for about 3 weeks before quitting, and I took a depression and personality disorder test. I quit before getting the results back though. But the real issue is I don’t *know* what’s wrong with me. And the therapist I saw said I shouldn’t have taken any of the online self-help quizzes as they are equatable to looking up symptoms on webmd and thinking you have cancer when really, you just have a cold. Although at the time he also dismissed my suicidal ideation as just something I “don’t want to do”. 

So I’m afraid to walk in and say, hey, I don’t know but I think I may have [x] wrong with me. Because I don’t want them to chastise me for doing it the wrong way. And I am legitimately afraid that I’ve *caused* certain feelings/symptoms to appear after trying to search for years of what is wrong with me. Maybe I’m perfectly healthy and I just have Factitious disorder. 

On top of that I’m not sure WHERE to go. Before I just looked up a therapist online and they didn’t take my insurance and I hated them. I don’t need someone to just talk to, I already have a good friend for that. I want someone to be able to diagnose me if necessary, put me on medication if necessary, be able to accurately attend to my specific needs. But I feel like I have such different problems in vastly different areas of my life that I won’t find just one person who can help with all of that. I want to explore what went on in my past emotionally, what’s going on in my present emotionally, I need help with my sexuality and relationships, my self esteem and overall view of the world, and I’m religious on top of that and I have no idea if that will cause a problem or not... at different times I’ve thought I had BPD, depression, bipolar, CEN, cPTSD - I have no idea what I have, I can’t even understand what I’ve been through most of the time.

177,"Hi everyone. I've struggled with mental health for a long time, since probably middle school. Yesterday I had the worst mental health day I've had in so long. I went to the bar with two of my friends and my female friend noticed I got quiet, and asked what was wrong. I said I was okay because it wasn't really the right setting to go into it, but I was having thoughts of death. 

A stranger took my seat at the bar (that my jacket was hung on) while i was outside, and i came back in and reached around him to get my drink. He moved but then continued to talk shit about me, and how I was a bitch, to the two friends I was with. They defended me, but later I told my male friend that I was in the worst head space I'd been in in a long time and he basically said ""i don't care, you were being rude"" which I think is a terrible response to someone telling you they're not okay mentally. As far as I'm concerned, we're not friends anymore. 

That was last night and I've been feeling similar all of today. I want to crawl out of my skin. Nothing I can think of would make me feel better. I just feel so alone and having such shit friends doesn't help.

180,"Today someone asked me if I have suicidal thoughts and I was not sure how to answer because honestly, I don’t really know the answer. 

Let me start by saying that I am a social worker and work in a position where so much of my work is about helping my clients receive the appropriate resources to address their mental health concerns. My job involved helping others with their mental health, and while I know it is completely okay, it still feels pretty discouraging to know that I, myself, have been struggling with my own mental health for the past two years. 

I’ve always considered it more of a situational sadness. I’ve always been a bubbly and happy person who just wanted to help others, but when I moved to a rural community in 2018 to work as a child welfare social worker, sadness hit me hard. I found myself sleeping as much as I possibly could and never finding the motivation to cook myself a meal or get in the shower. It was the lowest I’ve ever felt, and while I never ever wanted my life to end, there were many times where I thought how convenient it would be to get in a car accident and wake up in a few weeks. 

Well, I eventually left that job and followed my boyfriend across the country. I live in a big city, I’m living with my boyfriend, and have a great group of friends here. However, I am extremely burnt out with my job here and have only been working in the position for about four months. But it has been emotionally exhausting for me and I have found myself slipping back into that same sadness, and while I have absolutely no desire for my life to end and am so excited for so many things in my future, I am having the same thoughts about the convenience of my car slipping off the road or how peaceful it would be if one could take a handful of pills and just sleep for weeks rather than die. 

I don’t know what I’m feeling. Maybe this is just a temporary thing, and maybe it is will fade over time and as I continue to adjust to the changes in my life, but I just felt the need to finally say this somewhere. My boyfriend knows I’ve been having a hard time and has suggested we both go to counseling together, which I am totally in agreement with, but I think I’m hesitant because so many of my own clients go to these counselors and I have been there with them to support them, so it just doesn’t feel right in a way. But I do want to be at my best so I can help my clients in the absolute best way. 

Anyways, thanks if you’ve read this far. I don’t know if I’m looking for advice or validation or simply just needing somewhere to vent all of this. ❤️",21Nov2019,1
181,"Hi all, thanks in advance for taking the time to read he following..

I am a 25M majoring in computer science and as such I spend a lot of time alone. After my recent breakup resulting in this alone time actually being spent alone and not at home with the SO, I have been struggling to maintain a healthy mindset and I am not sure if it is maybe something I should be concerned about?

I struggle to communicate with others, even when I know what I want to say. My best form of communication is writing since it gives me time to structure my thoughts. Otherwise, I tend to get ahead of my own speech and trip over facts as im explaining something that I know. This comes off kinda frantic, and I think it makes people uncomfortable or unsure of what it is im trying to say.

I dont use any social media because I think its invasive of privacy and as such my social life is lacking vs what might be the norm for others my age. I dont go to bars, clubs, or parties. I was partying when I was 14 or 15 and back then I felt I had no issues socializing at all, it came naturally.

Now when im in public I get intense anxiety, sometimes resulting in me saying or doing things I dont want to. For example, last night I went to the gas station for beer and there was a girl in the beer cooler. (not my type, so genuinely wasnt interested in her) i was so nervous to go in the cooler to get my beer that when i did go in i grabbed something i didnt even want. Small example, but this kind of stuff happens to me a lot and when its a daily occurrance I start to worry if im ok?

I just feel like something changed in me that now scares people away from talking to me, and I don't know what that is. I cant put my finger on it. 

It makes me sad. I used to get such good reactions from people when talking to them. I enjoyed it, it made me happy to have good friends, but I have always been a bit on the shy side. I don't know what to do sometimes and I feel helpless to my situation. How can I start not only improving my ability to socialize in a healthy way without trying too hard but also improve my self-confidence and internal mental state?

I like to read and listen, so any books, podcasts, documentaries with good material is welcomed. Im just a bit clueless in this domain and I dont want to go fabricating answers to my own questions, I feel it would allow me to 'bend the truth' subconsiously and I'm really after the cold hard truth on why I am driving people away from me and how I can improve. I am sincere in my interactions with people when i can be, but my thoughts sometimes get a bit scrambled in a real social situation where i might not have time to come up with a response and i recognize idk wtf to say internally and I start to have a bit of a freakout.

Does any of this behavior sound familiar to anyone? Really, any advice is appreciated. This mindset is becoming unhealthy for me. I struggle with trust following my last relationship there was a lot of lying cheating and what I would call emotional abuse, feel free to check my post history, I have periodically posted little updates over the past year and have recieved tremendous support from some communities out there who I really appreciate. I just want to be sure im moving through all this in a healthy way. The last year or so has been really hard.",21Nov2019,1
182,"I'm fifteen and for the last year or two I've been processing something that happened when I was six or seven. My sister, who would've been 12ish at the time, sucked me off twice on different occasions. She pushed me to commit sexual activities on her too, but I don't think I did.

I've talked to two of my friends about it, but I've never mentioned it to any of my therapists or any adults. I don't know why I haven't, I guess it just feels like it's been too long, I don't want to ruin the relationship her and I have started to build again and it feels like it's my fault because at the time I didn't push her away because I didn't understand what was happening.

Not go in at all, my mum can phone in and say that it was stressing me too much etc. as the school staff that kinda handles these situations does know about me but I'd feel like I'd let the teacher that organised for me not to need to speak down if I don't go in.

I also laugh at jokes even if they're not funny (because it's less awkward than sitting there in silence and not knowing what to say)
I constantly do weird shit like talk really loudly or in different accents (again, it might be because I want people to think I'm funny)
I don't think before I speak. I start a sentence and then I stop because then I realise I shouldn't say something. It's like my brain's delayed. I begin to say something and then I tell them to ignore me (I think my brain's on autopilot all the time and I don't think)
I constantly stare at people and make eye contact with them (which is just weird, it's also creepy) 
Sometimes when I speak super fast, I end up speaking gibberish and no one knows what I'm saying (again, it might be because I don't think before I speak)
I make weird, sharp movements (because I'm thinking out loud and I forget that I'm not alone)
I make weird sounds in general (I don't know if it's because I'm so bored and I need to keep myself busy or if I'm a psychopath)
I fidget a lot and I can't keep my hands to myself 
I don't know if it's because I feel so out of place or if it's because I feel so uncomfortable all the time and that's why I do all of these things. I just feel so strange and I agree with people when they call me a weirdo (even though I hate to admit it)
I feel so on edge all the time and I don't know how to calm myself down. I'm so hyper all the time. But at the same time if I stay calm, I feel like I'm boring the person and then I panic and then I start acting like a weirdo (it's a never ending cycle)
I'm constantly daydreaming because I hate my current situation and weirdly enough when I imagine talking to someone my lips move and it seems like I'm talking to myself (which is super embarrassing). Daydreaming takes my mind off of everything, but it's super depressing when I stop and I come back to reality (I'm a lot better now and I don't daydream as much)
I constantly feel like I'm under so much pressure

As weird as it sounds, I feel like I'm watching myself play a character. Almost as if I'm not allowing myself to be my true self because I think I'm boring. I don't know why I can't allow myself to slow down. 
I'm always rushing myself and I have to do everything at an unusually fast pace. I'm so erratic with everything, whether it be me talking to someone or walking. I don't know what to do about this.

My partner is from Germany, currently living with me in the UK, For almost 2 years now. She has been fluent in English since a child and I am learning German for 2 years. My level is practically an infant. My partner has not had any issues at all when she moved over, culture and language wise as far as I know. She has never complained about things Germany does better or whatever it has been very smooth process.

Ive visited Germany around 5 times now and every time I just get burnout from the culture shock, languages etc. It feels different than a typical tourist, im around more locals, nothing touristy. Her friends know English, several different levels of the language mind you but in all they are practically fluent. 

Maybe three days into my travels everytime I get major burnout and depression to the point I feel I physically cant speak, even in English. Being around her friends all speaking German, its too fast and so much to take in at once to translate in my head that I feel left out a lot of the time. I dont expect them to speak English all the time just for me, i guess I do take it as a learning experience to hear the native language. But I feel mentally drained to ever translate what words I know, I just zone out during these times and remain distant. 

It just feels to much right now especially after being here several times Im scared to believe this might be too much for me. Ive never been a strong mental person to begin with. I feel like I'm rambling now so I just need to hear from others if they have experienced this

My mom (59) got fired from her job 3 years ago by being bullied and shit talking by colleagues. Ever since she's been going the 'spiritual' route with all kinds of expensive classes she takes. (which she can't afford, she owes me 3k€ and my brother 5k€ ish) 

Since she got fired she's convinced she can feel the pain/fear of other people, mainly colleagues or family.
She has a pretty big alcohol problem for years which she acknowledges but doesn't do anything about ""it'll be easier when it's the right time"" ""fate will help me stop when I need to""

She refuses to take any advice or help we try to give her and now with her new job, it's going the exact same way as last time. To the point where her bos/manager sent her home on medical leave (to help her I'm assuming) but my mom sees this as being banned from working, and it's all a plot to get her fired, ""she can feel it"". 

She sometimes just starts crying (mainly when drunk) and acts like it's a normal thing afterwards. 

Me and my brother really think she needs psychological help but she doesn't think there's a problem and ""we just don't trust/believe in her."" 

Now just after I went to say goodnight I heard her crying and stompim on the floor in the other room, I went to comfort her but she told me to leave.

This will happen for 10-20 seconds and my body physically reacts with fight-or-flight. But once that 10-20 seconds is over, I suddenly can't remember the dreams again. This can happen when I'm at home, at work, any time at all.

All I can guess is that I'm dipping into my subconscious while I'm awake and I can't figure out why. I can deal with it, even when I'm at work, but the panic attacks seriously impair my short and long term memory for the entire day. If it's a really bad set of attacks, I'll suffer confusion and dizziness.

I'd love to know if anyone else suffers with this and if you have any coping mechanisms or methods to help lessen attacks like this?",21Nov2019,1
195,"Hi fellow Redditors. I'm a 25 year old male from India. For the past 13-14 years I have been suffering from severe OCD and other anxiety related issues. I also developed secondary depression somewhere along the road.

My mental health has had severe repercussions on my life (for eg. failing my Bachelor's 4 times which led to me having 4 gap years) which my family and others, unbeknownstly attribute to my incompetence, laziness, incapability etc. My parents do sense that there's something wrong with me but I doubt that they think it's due to me being mentally ill. 

In April this year after deep contemplation, I finally mustered the courage to see a psychiatrist. My appointment with him was brief and he seemed only interested in hearing about my symptoms and treating them. He diagnosed me with anxiety and secondary depression and prescribed me antidepressants. Taking the medication did make me feel significantly better but I really hated the side-effects.

I was all fine after that until I experienced something that triggered my OCD intensely. It's been about 5 months now that I have been trying to overcome this but in vain. I have once again spiralled into severe depression and to be straightforward am having suicidal thoughts.

All that I want is my parents to know about my mental illnesses. I need them to understand that the reason for my erratic behaviour or incompetence or whatever has been due my mental illnesses. My mother is hyper religious and upon revelation will assume that I'm possessed and will ask me to resort to prayers. My father is quite normal in such matters but at the moment I can sense that he despises me. I'm absolutely terrified about how to go through with this but this is something that needs to be done.

So, if any of you could please share some tips on how I can make this revelation to my conservative Indian parents, I would be grateful. Also, I apologise if I haven't been able to explain my situation properly, I'm not in my prime atm.


**TLDR : I'm a 25 year old male from India and I need to tell my conservative/religious parents that I'm mentally ill. How do I do that without freaking them out?**",21Nov2019,1
196,"After my therapist sent me to the crisis house quite a few times, it really has made me not want to talk to her about anything. I've been suicidal and depressed for my entire life and I get why she sent me to the crisis house. But it feels like I can't say anything anymore without her overreacting. She almost sent me to the hospital about a month ago, luckily, someone stuck up for me and I didn't go. I'm just not sure what to do. I'm just as depressed as I was before, I just can't fucking talk about it.",21Nov2019,1
197,"I feel downright repulsed by the thought of people helping me at this point. I do NOT want to voice my struggles or how I'm feeling because for some unknown reason just the thought of people loving and supporting me feels bad. I don't know why. I love my friends and family and I know they care about me but just thinking of them trying to make me feel better just makes me feel... disgusted, I think the word is.  


I want to get more help for other problems in my life, like my procrastination, stress, and paranoia. And I know that anybody who I try to talk with will support me on it and love me. But I don't want that for some reason. Something in my screams ""No"" whenever I think about just talking to somebody. The only real time I express my emotions to people I know is when they're ones of anger or happiness, but I never talk about my actual problems. At this point I've been struggling with this for 3 years and nobody even knows because I refuse to tell them.   


Right now I've got so much to do and I feel terrible and depressed about quite a few things (Not suicidal, at least) and I've really been wanting to send a message to a chat me and my friends have EXPLICITLY for getting help and support, one that I've never used, but something within me just cannot stand getting that affection and will not let me hit enter. What do I do?",21Nov2019,1
