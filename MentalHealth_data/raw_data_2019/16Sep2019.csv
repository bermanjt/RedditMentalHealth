It's basically about a man who just doesn't want to be ordinary and average. He deceives, hates, loves, ignores, scares, pretends just so he is ""someone"". 

I have realised recently this is me. I have been trying so many different things just so I am not boring and ordinary. Lazy Sunday afternoon's are my worst nightmares. Bizzare? 

I am interested in so many different things - cooking, baking, musical theatre, theatre, films, alcohols, coffee, good food, card, neuroscience, art, perfumes, fashion, politics, organisational behaviour, opera, law. I am creative but also want to be good at maths. I want to be a musical theatre actor but also want to work as an investment banker, or a lawyer, or a consultant ... I want to continue learning Swedish, and French, and musical theory ... I want to be awfully rich but also want to simply enjoy my job. I want to have a gorgeous ripped body but also believe I should enjoy myself and have pizza.

Point is, as in the play, I do and want all of that but in the end, i am none of the above. I can have a short conversation about any of the topics but couldn't really spend ages debating a topic. In the end, I am average... 

Not sure why I wrote that. Any comments, advice, motivation, personal stories are welcome.",16Sep2019,1

2,"My fiancé has been insecure about his weight since he was about 13. He is tall and had a hard time gaining weight. He tried over eating at first to get fat but when that didnt work he started working out like crazy and even did steroids for 2 years. He works out everyday for at least 2 hours a day but can workout for 4 hours straight if he has time. 

He's a huge guy and very muscular but admits that whenever he looks in the mirror or pictures he still sees the skinny 13 year old he used to be. He says he's ugly and wants to be bigger and it breaks my heart. People have said how attractive he is and make jokes about his muscles but he feels like they're lying. 

I've never had bad body issues so I can't say I completely understand but I want to help him. Hes been trying to get better about it, first step being that he stopped using the scale because he would obsess over his weight. Is there anyone that struggled with body image that found ways that help? Thank you

4,"Hi everyone,

Please help me out. I've been struggling with an overpowering addiction to sugar and flavoured coffee for a couple of years now, but this past week it got out of control entirely: I've been having more than one flavoured coffee and multiple sweet treats most days, and I've noticed that I gained all the weight I'd just lost back. My skin is not doing great either, and I've been having stomach cramps after every dainty as well. So I'm deliberately hurting my health -- does this count as self-harm? Yet despite all that, I keep doing it. I keep going to Starbucks or Second Cup for a Caramel Macchiato or a Mocha before and between classes, I keep grabbing cookies with breakfast or dinner in the dining hall, I keep getting muffins when I'm going to coffeeshops to study  -- all for a second of satisfaction followed by hours of pain. I've just started my first year at a huge and super competitive university, but I've gone through pretty much the same thing last year and two years ago, when I was finishing high school while living abroad alone, so I *should* know how to deal with that, but no! The monster inside my head is beyond my control. 

I know a lot about nutrition and I know exactly what I should and shouldn't eat or drink, so I don't need any nutrition advice. I keep promising myself to stop consuming so much sugar that just feeds the ongoing inflammation in my body and at least limit myself to one coffee or one pastry per day, but it's a giant failure. Just look at what I ate today: I had French toast for breakfast, then I got a fudge brownie after lunch, and after dinner I went to Starbucks and got a fancy mocha and a pumpkin scone! I feel disgusted with myself and I really, really want to eat just like normal people do, because the way I'm eating makes me unproductive and freaking miserable and just ruins my life. I don't want to go back into my old ED mindset, but I need to stop deliberately ruining my body. 

Sorry if this sounded too bitter. Please help me, I'm desperate!",16Sep2019,1

Until today I'd given up on my dream to become a writer (words haven't come to me like they used to and I just found myself overwhelmed when considering topics that seem worthwhile) or go through college (I'm 24 now). Anyway, it's hard to tell how far i am from where i once was, but the difference thus far is day and night. 

Aside from this, I finally feel present. I forgot what meditating is supposed to feel like. It's almost overwhelming how lost i can get in it (the only thing not showing a whole lot of improvement yet is my visual imagination). Anyway, exciting times, thanks for reading.",16Sep2019,8
6,"So, for most of my life I have struggled with depression. My parents are abusive and have never been supportive (I'm 33m). I don't live with them anymore but they've done some very destructive things psychologically, emotionally, and even physically (I believe my mother has Narcissistic personality disorder and my step father is the same). I've never been able to form any good relationships because I don't know how to establish boundaries. I always end up pushing people away. A few years ago, I was wrongfully accused of a crime I didn't commit. I didn't want to fight it because it would've meant prison time, (I'm currently on probation), and I can't be away from my son. I've already consulted r/legaladvice on this issue and let's just say they are belligerently biased. Unfortunately, I found my mother's illness in a partner, which is why I have a child. She's a real piece of work too. We're separated. She constantly lies even when it comes to our child. I'm currently couch surfing and living with a friend. Problem is that it's not going to last much longer. I'm going to be out in a few days as they are about fed up with me. (I can't find a job that'll even look at me). I don't have a car because the one I had was in my parent's name (just one more way they were controlling me).",16Sep2019,1

9,"I’m 17, i’ve been previously diagnosed with generalised anxiety and persistent depressive disorder.

I went to therapy for depression for a while but it didn’t work out, so i stopped and just went to the gym as consistently as i could. i can’t really talk to anyone about my mental state other than people that are close or me that i trust. I rejected taking anti depressants because even though I went regularly hurt myself and i knew i had depression i felt i shouldn’t because that would pull attention towards it which i don’t want. 

but recently i’ve never really had any idea of what i actually feel, i’m sad, and then i think i’m happy but i don’t know if i’m actually happy or just distracted, i don’t know if anything i actually feel is just me tricking myself into feeling that way or if i actually feel that way, i usually feel disconnected from myself, the only way i can really describe it is like emotions are an attachment of “me” but i don’t know what “me” is and i don’t know if i feel nothing or i’m actually normal and i just don’t understand what it feels like to be normal. when i consciously think about happiness or smiling everything i do while thinking like that just feels fake, so i’m now completely lost wondering if i’m still depressed or wether i’m “normal”, sometimes it will just feel like everything i’m doing is in some kind of game and then that will go because i find a way to distract myself but then it will return and i don’t know it or wether there’s something else like depersonalisation derealisation going on and every time i feel depressed for longer periods of time now i just feel like i’m not actually depressed and i’m just faking it for some stupid ridiculous reason that i don’t know about, i don’t feel like i did before i stoped hurting myself but i don’t feel ok, but then is feeling ok just something i don’t have enough experience with or am i just going through thought cycles of being distracted enough to not notice how i actually feel.

I went on a skiing holiday to france on my own in march and i had to get my parents to by me a flight home 2 days in because i was too sad to continue and that was the point i realised i had to force myself to be ok because i was aware of how mentally messed up i was, crying in the corridor of a hotel where everyone is asleep and i couldn’t bare the thought of being in my room or near anyone while calling my friend at 3am with cuts down both my arms but after that and after i stopped hurting myself i don’t actually know what i feel. the last time i did that was 5 weeks ago and i don’t know why i did it, i think it was to feel something. 

when i’m at work i think i’m happy or at least when i’m talking to my co workers but i don’t know if that’s just a facade to what i actually feel or wether that’s actually what i feel.

i don’t really know if there’s any point or i expect anyone to read this, i think i’m just hopeful someone has been through something like this and can explain anything or help me work out what i actually feel",16Sep2019,1

13,"So this one might be long but my life, from when i was a little girl, was always difficult. I never realized how bad it really was because i was so young and that was the only life I've known. I was abused by my step dad, neglected by both parents, raped by a friends boyfriend, bullied in middle school, never had clean clothes or caring parents and my parents were drug addicts who spent all their savings on drugs. This last from when I was around 5 to the age of 16 when my grandma finally took me and my brother under her wing. My parents fled to Pennsylvania to aboid charges of fraud and theft and barely even talk to me but my brother has always been the favorite out me and my sister so they call him almost every day. My previous boyfriends have always left me due to PTSD, anxiety, depression, trust issues and insecurities that I barely even knew about. I'm on medication for that but part of the recovery has to be done by me too. Im having a hard time coping with my anxiety especially with my new job where the managers get mean and loud and due to my father beating his girlfriends in front of me the raising voices bring back the PTSD. Just looking for some comfort from people who have been there too. I was checked into a hospital for suicidal thoughts and tendencies/cutting and one of nurses recommended reddit to me.

22,"Hi reddit, I'm 18 and going off to college very soon but am having a lot of trouble.

I've been having awful problems with my identity and feel empty and bored, like there could be something fun to do. I imagine going out with my friends but it just seems so unappealing. I've become more antisocial and too lazy to answer texts, only posting on my spam and scrolling through my feed.

I look at pictures of myself and want to cry. How can this person, with so many thoughts and emotions, be in that horrifying body? Is that me, or am I someone else instead of an acne ridden freak? I can't believe myself. So many things in this stupid, undeserving body. I am someone else, I swear. Or at least I need to be someone else. How I'm part of this skinny stupid frame, I don't know. That body can't be mine. It just doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

I feel so empty. Objectively, I'm in a good place right now. Doing well in school, having lots of friends, and improving my sleep schedule. But something will always feel off. I lost all empathy and prefer to see people fall instead of rise; it's disgusting. But it makes me feel better about my own self and I really hate myself for it, I really wish I don't think the way I do. I wish I could feel happy about other people doing well but I just can't. I wish I wasn't so jealous.

Whenever I socialize I rethink every single interaction I have and beat myself up for every awkward silence, every time someone didn't respond to what I said. I am so obnoxious and loud and annoying and weird and off-beat that I always think about it. I'll feel like an awful person forever and see myself as awkward and dumb even though I can read social cues. I'm also very very boring, or at least I think I am. I never want to talk to anyone ever again because of how dumb I am I wish I wasn't like that.

I feel like no one wants or needs me. I feel like no one is willing to date me or do anything remotely sensual with me, even though I am not a virgin and have been in a couple relationships. So whenever I get the chance, I will give my body to someone even if I have no sexual attraction to them whatsoever. I need validation so bad it disgusts me.

My parents promise me they'll get me a therapist but never follow through. I'm hoping to get one or see a psychiatrist but I just can't because they think I'm fine because I don't have a short temper or anything and act happy. I wish they knew. Do you guys have anything to say or give me any advice?  Are there any diagnoses I should look into or tell a psychiatrist?  I kinda dumped all of my problems on this post because I felt like I needed to do it somewhere.

tl;dr: I have an incredibly unstable sense of identity, feel empty, overthink the social interactions I've had, give my body to people I'm not attracted to, feel like my empathy is disappearing, and hate my body and face. What should I do?",16Sep2019,1
24,"TLDR: I might be mentally ill and when I told my mom I wanna see a therapist or psychiatrist she turned on me, put words in my mouth, tried to minimize my mental health, and made me look like a jackass.

So I've thought for awhile that I might have ocd. I took online tests and asked the r/OCD subreddit questions to get an idea of if I should see a specialist (not instead of a diagnosis just to be clear). People on that sub have been telling me I should and that I should tell my parents about it. So I did.

I sent my mom screenshots of the results of the ocd tests I retook (I took them awhile back too but my answers have changed since learning more about ocd) and told her I think I have ocd and it could be worse than I thought so I should talk to someone. She said we'll have to wait to make an appointment and I said okay. So she suddenly snaps at me to show her my Kaiser card and I do, but the thing she was calling was closed. So she snaps at me again ""stop taking those tests and stop freaking out about it"" in a very annoyed tone like she was done with my shit. I told her I wasn't going to, and that made her lose her shit.

We entered this never ending loop of her going ""I'm just saying not to do them"" and me going ""I was just assuring you I won't"", every time I told her I was letting her know not to worry, she says again ""I just said don't!"" On top of that she said I freak myself out about everything, sending her a million screenshots and demanding to see a specialist right away. I told her I send her a lot of stuff (more like 10 at the *most*, today it was literally five) because I find a lot of stuff and just think I should show her (I take tests and get five screenshots and just think I should show her the results have gotten worse), and I don't expect to see anyone right away. Then she starts this loop of ""that's not what it *seemed* like"" and me saying ""sorry about that but everything's fine don't worry"", then she says again it didn't seem that way.

She also says it's a big jump to want to see a psychiatrist and that means I'm freaking out. I told her I just saw it as taking the next step - first you realize there's something wrong, then you realize what it might be, then you see a professional. She starts another ""it didn't seem that way"" loop with me saying ""sorry it didn't but that's my intention"" and her repeating herself again.

She says ""don't freak out just cuz nothing's happening right now"" and I told her I'm fine with waiting a bit to see someone. But she still kept repeating it.

She keeps saying I work myself up about everything and I tell her this time I wasn't, but she won't listen. She just keeps repeating herself and not listening to me saying everything is fine. She said when I thought I was depressed a few years ago that I freaked out, I didn't remember it in the moment but now I remember that she kept brushing off me not being happy with being a normal teenager, so when I told her I wanted to see a therapist and she said I'm a normal teenager I started crying cuz I wasn't being listened to and I was brushed off again, I started crying and saying ""I don't feel *normal*, I *really* need to see someone, *please!*"" I cried cuz I didn't want to be shushed, I wanted to be heard. That's not the same as freaking out - that's *frustration.*

She also said things I really don't remember saying or doing. She said the last time I told her I might have ocd I freaked out and sent her a million things, I swear to god I never freaked out and I sent her a *handful* of things. She said I told her I would talk to my counselor at school instead or first, I really don't remember saying that.

She said I came downstairs with an attitude and I really didn't, I was just trying to tell her I'm sorry it seemed like I did but she wouldn't listen and said I was snapping or whatever. On top of this the truth is that *she* came at *me* with an attitude *first* and *she* snapped at *me* first. Even if I wasn't too overwhelmed to think of saying this I don't have the guts to say it anyway, especially in a conflict like this.

Her constantly saying I freak myself out about *everything* (not true, only some things but I think she exaggerated cuz she was mad) made me feel like she was trying to blow me off like I'm fine and have nothing to worry about. She did the same thing when I thought I was depressed - ""you're a teenager and teenagers have crazy hormones so you're not depressed you're a normal teen."" Now I think I have ocd - ""you freak out about everything so you don't have ocd you're just freaking out like you usually do."" I don't freak out about literally everything it's certain things, which is why I think I might have ocd I freak out about certain things no one else does, that's why I want to see someone. The reason why she's blowing me off (or at least that's how it seems) is the reason why I need to see someone.

She also is annoyed that I took online tests. I never said they were 100% accurate, I just wanted an idea of if I should see a therapist or something. If I got a low score I wouldn't, and if I got a high score I would and I would *see what the therapist says.* I didn't like the idea of blindly going in there, that probably isn't a bad thing but I'm worried about being told nothing is wrong and looking like an idiot and making them wonder why I came. I'd like to at least have a reason to go if that makes sense. I tried to tell her this but she still said stuff online is bullshit. I guess all the stuff she looks at online doesn't matter, just what I look at. Even stuff I look at that has just a little bit of truth in it, like websites dedicated to mental health listing symptoms. 

She also said there's other people that can't leave their houses and I can so I probably don't have it. My dad said the same thing when I thought I was depressed - he said he's seen people not be able to get out of bed, so because I can that means I'm *happy.* Couldn't have been further from the truth at that time. Both times my parents thought that because there's people who have it worse than me I must not have it bad at all. Yeah there's people who have it worse than me, but that doesn't mean I'm fine cuz there's still something wrong with me. Plus I have a friend with anxiety and depression and another friend with ptsd, and they both come to school. By my parents' logic neither of them are mentally ill.

She kept saying over and over that I was freaking out. Well if she thought I was, shouldn't she be more compassionate towards me instead of fucking *yelling* at me?! If you think someone is freaking out shouldn't you try to *comfort* them?! She never yells anymore either and barely raises her voice even, but today she super raised her voice and even yelled at me at one point, like *actually yelled.* She hasn't done that in years. It was only for a second at least but still, she got that worked up over nothing that she yelled at me.

I tried to tell my mom I didn't mean anything she thought I did and that I'm just trying to assure her, plus I apologized *several* times, but she just said something (I forget what) to make me look bad again. I was so overwhelmed and frustrated I started crying saying ""I don't know how we got here in this crazy mess all I wanted to do wa reassure you."" So she got fed up with me and just sent me upstairs, snapping at me to ""just go"". I was still trying to tell her stuff and I was really upset but she wouldn't listen because I had tears. If someone is crying you know they're at their breaking point and you would think people would show some compassion in that situation, you would think if someone made someone else cry the first person would realize they really fucked up. But no, not my mom. She just sends me away like a toddler throwing a tantrum.

My mom says I can come to her about anything and she's always willing to listen. She's usually really good at it too, she's usually really understanding and explains her side really well so we both get where the other's coming from. But today was *not* one of those days, and it makes me wonder if I can even come to her at all for mental health stuff cuz she already did this with possible (keyword is possible) depression once.

25,"I've been in and out of therapy since I was 11. I'm 26 now. I live in the US. I'm venting but also seeking advice because I feel too overwhelmed to find a new therapist or whatever. Is it a therapist I need or a psychiatrist? I have no idea.

&amp;#x200B;

The first time I tried to kill myself, I called 911 and got put in a learning hospital's emergency psychiatric ward. I feel the learning part is important, might not be. I spoke to one of the psychiatrists there and I was trying to explain all the struggles I've had in my life with socializing, fitting in and just being a person. I mentioned how when I was 4 I hit my head on the fire place and my parents never took me to the doctor. Several months later, I was learning how to jump from a swing and face planted so hard I killed 4 teeth. They never took me to the doctor.

&amp;#x200B;

Last summer, I started shaving my head for an undercut hair style. Someone shaving my hair pointed out this weird scar I have on the back of my head and have since been told by several mothers that it's probably from hitting my head really hard. They asked a few questions about it, but I don't even remember it. I just know that as a kid my parents would stack up a bunch of junk on top of the freezer we kept ice cream treats in and when I was about 4 or 5, once a bunch of shit collapsed on my head when I went to open it. This was a regular occurrence.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like these head injuries are important, but everyone  (except for a jail psychologist I spoke to) has discounted it, and said that if I was suffering from problems relating to it, I wouldn't be as functional as I am. But that's the thing--I am not functional, I have never been functional. Since turning 18 I have not been able to keep a job. I avoid people. I haven't ever been good at math. Frontal Lobe injuries explain a lot of problems I had as a child--but no one believes me. In short doses, you'd think I'm normal. But if you're exposed to me for a while, I'm not normal, and have been told by a bunch of people over the years...including my most recent ex, who was a huge dick about what I always considered autistic stemming (stimming?) and now I've learned to only do that in private. The people at the learning psych ward are still learning, but they were adamant about it not being a thing to worry about.

&amp;#x200B;

How can I find the right person to help treat my problems when no one will take the things I say seriously because I'm good at masking? What if I'm not autistic like I think and I'm a sociopath because of the head injuries? It doesn't help that I'm a huge true crime nerd and lately the fact a lot of people became serial killers after a near-fatal head injury as a kid has not been sitting well with me.

26,"So lately I've been so overwhelmed with school, work, my roommate moving out, sexual assault, but mainly my feelings for my ex.  My ex and I (we were together for almost 3 years, but hung out for like almost 4 years) had stop talking for what felt like a month or longer, but it had only been like 3 weeks. We passed each other around the area that I live coincidentally. He was excited to see me and I felt like a weird feeling in my stomach. Of course I was happy to see him, but I'm also selfish and find it hard to see people I love happy without me. Not to mention all of my feelings came rushing back. He messaged me not long after. So we started hooking up and just hanging out for short amounts of time. We weren't spending the night with each other anymore because I was a bum for like a month living there and I made him depressed. (I feel awful about that, but find it extremely hard to change - I have a job and going to school, just lack motivation to do things outside of that) Last night, I went over there after work to fool around, but then he started talking about like his whole life philosophy and how he's got big dick energy and how he's so much happier now that I'm gone, that I made him depressed so since I have problems communicating, I didn't have a whole lot to say. It really felt like he was lecturing me, because he points out that ""oh I don't want to lecture you but..."". I was starting to feel possessive when he would tell me about his proud chub while he was in the club and girls wanting to dance on him and how he gets loads of attention from literally almost EVERY girl. ( I dealt with this a lot when we were together and it made me very insecure and he would get mad at me for that) Anyways, last night we ended in a screaming match after me only being there for like an hour and he told me I should leave since I had weird energy and wasn't really talking. Says he doesn't have time for people like that. I hate him, but I also love him and want to be around him. I'm just selfish, bad at communication, and possessive. I know very toxic... I'm a lot like my mom and it makes me sad and I don't want to be like this, I just don't know if I'm truly capable of change - which makes me feel even worse. So now that him and I don't talk now I don't really feel like I have anyone I can talk to about how I'm feeling where they won't just give me a bs answer. I don't really have a whole lot of friends that I talk to, I mainly keep to myself because I don't feel like anyone wants to talk to me because of how selfish I am. I hate to just feel sorry for myself, I just don't know what to do.",16Sep2019,3
27,"This probably will be the last post I make on Reddit before I depart. But my life goes into utter turmoil when I come in to big amounts of money.. if I get a sniff of anyway I can buy now, pay later (after pay, PayPal, zip pay I spend as much as it will allow and that's normally around $1000. So in the last week I spent $900 on birthday presents and just random shit for the kids. Last big spend I had was $1000 on sex toys, one before that was a $700 smart T.V.. before that 2gaming consoles and all the crap that goes with it $1500. When I spend this money I lose it a bit, and can't stop myself from spending. I get so overwhelmed and excited that it stresses me out because I'm too excited, then I get frustrated and literally need to masturbate to calm myself d0wn. Now I'm on bipolar meds I've realised these are highs and to take a quick release pill but by the time I start doing that the money's already spent and I'm on the tail end of the high waiting for the packages to come.

I'm at a weird point with my mum, she's my best friend but she's toxic for me and my two kids. I'm a single mum, kids are 2 and 4. I love her and spend alot of time at her place but we drink together. I only drink while I'm at her place. Then I realise this is the bullshit I had to deal with this as a kid and hated it. Some days I think of when it will get to a time that she passes away and I'll finally be free of her mapping out my life and having such a strong influence on me, not just parenting but her bad mouthing kids dad, or my only few friends that I have. Every milestone I had growing up revolved around her, including my bfs. She's always been a downer in my relationships. I could go on about how much of a shitty teen I was and how much she's helped me out, which like I said she is my best friend, someone who i tell everything to and generally enjoy. She helps me out ALOT with my kids and I am so so greatful. And then I hate on my self for thinking of when she will pass away. 

I'm currently trying to quit smoking cigarettes.. Well I'm not even trying. Again whole I'm out at my mum's I will smoke her tobacco but at home I don't smoke I used nicorette quick mists but as soon as I'm out at my mum's again I smoke. I don't want to go out to her place (she lives out of town) I think right me and kids are staying home today were going to have a fun day then because she hasn't seen us for a day she'll say she wants to get one of them or invites me out to stay the night. I can't say no to her, I don't ever want to until it's already happening.

She's always influenced me on my friends, making me paranoid health wise. At one point she got me so paranoid about having scabies that Every time I was around this one friend who was always scratching I would scratch because my mum told me shed be catching them from her boyfriend's house. I accused my friend of it and she literally went to the doctors and got a certificate to prove she had dermatitis. 

The only friend I do have at the moment she bags put around me because my ex cheated on me with her, I bashed her and stopped talking to her for years. Before that though I had hooked up with her ex just after they broke up so it was pay bake I guess. Anyway fast forward 13 years after the fight I had with her we've got back in contact and are actually pretty good friends, we've both changed heaps and haven't bothered bring it up.

My mum also always bags out kids dad in front of them. That will never change but at the end of the day he never did anything wrong, he was useless around the house with house work and had anger issues  ( never got physical with me), wasn't very good with the kids and still isn't really unless I invite him over to visit them but at the end of the day hes a friendly happy person. I hate that my mum says that his stupid, useless. If I say anything positive about him she'll back lash and turn it into a negative. 

Anyway I don't know how to break this tie I have with her emotionally. Like the perfect situation would be to take a step back, so still see and do as much but not have that too close for comfort deal and not tell her everything. Basically not best friends anymore",16Sep2019,1

This is a man that had great potential as a musician, but schizophrenia affected him so strongly that he's now in a locked facility.

Those with mental challenges will always receive sub-standard care in a large society with bureaucracy.  It's a function of the complexity of society in developed nations, particularly in the  United States.  People's good intentions are generally no match for large social systems.

Once technology advances to the point of developing Artificial General Intelligence, many of the issues in developed society could disappear.  If the majority of people's physical and material needs can be satisfied through advanced technology, then society can become a group of smaller communities, aka villages.  No more than 250 people, the interpersonal relationships between people would become more central to a community/village.

Those with mental challenges can become better integrated into a community/village based on the network of interpersonal relationships.

30,"Back in April, one of my friends tricked me into going to the ER when she noticed my behavior became... well, insane, after starting an antidepressant. It was there that I admitted I had taken about 100 Ibuprofen pills and around 50 iron tablets a few days before that. They checked my blood, it was clear for salicylates and iron, so they labeled me a liar. They did a metabolic panel, and urine test. It was abnormal, but they attributed it to a UTI and threw antibiotics at me. 

I was transferred to Windsor Laurelwood in Cleveland. When I mentioned I was feeling a lot of stomach pain (later found out I caused a lot of stomach ulcers from the ibuprofen) the psychiatrist shut me up. I was told to stop exaggerating. I started having a really serious flare of Crohn's Disease, and not long before April I actually had surgery for Crohn's-related fistulas. The flare became so bad I could not walk into the facility's cafeteria because the smell of food made me nauseous. After arguing with my psychiatrist, a dietician came to see me. I told her all the foods that bother my Crohn's and she told me to ""stop faking it."" (Should be noted I'm overweight. I had lost about 80 lbs that year because of the disease, but I was still overweight.) Then later found out the psychiatrist called and told my dad that I'm faking having severe Crohn's (it's diagnosed from multiple colonoscopies, nothing less than severe and with serious complications from it, I also have pretty severe psoriasis, uveitis, and arthritis), and that I'm faking having an ongoing police/Title IX case for attention. I did not live with my parents at the time, I go to college 4 hours away from them, so my dad didn't even know about this case. 

I brought up with the psychiatrist that my best friends for years have told me they really believe I have Bipolar Disorder. The psychiatrist told me I'm a pathological liar, manipulative, and that everything points to Histrionic Personality Disorder. He prescribed me Wellbutrin at a high dose. One of the worst things you can give to someone with PTSD, btw. 

I returned to college and saw the school psychiatrist. She immediately took me off of Wellbutrin. A few weeks later, I went back to the ER for severe stomach pain and vomiting blood. I was flagged in their system. They sent me home with nothing. Two months later, I had an endoscopy/colonoscopy and a lot of damage was found in my stomach all the way to my small intestine, most definitely from the Ibuprofen overdose. They medicated me, symptoms of stomach ulcers went away. 

A few months later, a therapist I had been seeing for awhile finally diagnosed me with Bipolar I Disorder and PTSD. I was started on Latuda and Prazosin. 

Recently, it's clear my kidneys are failing, and biopsies showed it was because of scar tissue. It's not for sure yet, but the most likely cause is the Ibuprofen overdose went untreated for so long, and it destroyed my kidneys. When my nephrologist went back to my blood tests when I was in the ER, it was clear my kidneys had started to fail then, but instead of looking into it, without doing urine cultures to diagnose it properly the doctors just treated it like a UTI. If they had listened to me, I could have avoided all this. 

It took months to get my dad's trust back after all the horrible things the psychiatrist (only met with him like twice) told him about me. My current doctors and my dad see now that I was never a liar in my entire life. The Title IX case ended up turning out in our favor (multiple women went against this guy). My life is so much better now, but now I'm losing my kidneys. If only they had listened to me.",16Sep2019,5

35,"I’m 18F. I just started college around a month ago. I have severe social anxiety and generalized anxiety. Ever since school started my mental health hasn’t been good. Like at all. I haven’t thought about suicide or anything like that but I’ve just been replaying bad moments and I’m crippled by fear. I feel totally unable to go to my classes in college. I’m scared about stomach noises. I know it’s so stupid which is even more frustrating. 

When I was in high school I had a very hard time. My parents would drag me out of bed because that’s what my psychologists would tell them to do. I’ve almost had the police called on me because of refusing to go to school and I ended up missing months of school almost every year and caused suffering to my whole family and myself.

I feel like my experience with high school has permanently left an effect on me. Recently though it’s been really bad and I just want it to stop. I can’t even go see my psychologist anymore because I used up all my sessions covered by insurance and I don’t want my parents having to pay money every time.

Now I try to explain my feelings to my bf but I never feel better talking to him. He asks “what’s so wrong with school” and “just forget the past stuff and pretend it’s the first time ever going to school” and he says a lot of encouraging stuff like “you got this I know you can do it” and it helps sometimes but i need more. I feel like I almost have PTSD from high school if that’s possible.

I dread the future too, I constantly think about if anyone will ever truly like me, if I'll have a better life, and things like that.

40,"As with some people with anxiety, I’ve always got that suspicion that everyone doesn’t like me, that people act nice to my face because they feel sorry for me, etc. A few months ago, around June, I was at my peak, always going to parties, getting out and doing things I never could before because I had my closest friends, who were like brothers to me at my back, and I felt like the king of the world because of it. I’ve always had some trust issues, and I fear of people thinking less of me, and for reasons lately I had to lie to my closest friends for the reason of at the time I thought if I told the truth their opinion of me would sink and never come back up, and overall they would think less of me. Today they finally confronted me on this lie, and not only thought less of me because of what the truth was, but because the fact I lied at all. All of the sudden I had my three closest friends, the closest I’d ever had, coming at me from all sides tearing me apart, no one else there to talk to or to console me as they were digging into me, as there had always been someone, at least one person, even when I was at my most alone. They’re still at it as I’m writing this, and all of this coupled with the fact they had told/talked to any and all of my other friends, close or not, about it, so I’ve been left completely alone. My Mom is never home, my brother is verbally abusive, and my dad isn’t around much on top of all of this.

I don’t know where to go from here, I’m completely alone, isolated, and I don’t trust myself to stay alone because my current state is crippling. I’m turning to here for the sole purpose to hopefully find someone to talk to or at least just get it out here so I don’t feel completely alone.

I’ve had issues with anxiety &amp; depression, anorexia, bulimia, psychosis, and other conditions throughout my life, in the past they’ve been bad, but never to the point where I’m crippled and as completely defeated as I am now. I can’t think of trying to make new friends considering half of the people in my school of 1700 kids either want to hurt me because of what they’ve heard, and the other half will just refuse to talk to me.

I have an issue with becoming obsessed with people I have feelings for/attracted to (only people I know in real life). This extends to cyber-stalking these people, and consistently checking their social media multiple times a day, despite whether they’ve posted or not. I don’t have a real reason for doing it I believe, but I know it’s a very bad habit that invades their and others that they’re in contact with privacy. Sometimes I do this when I with people, or I’m doing a hobby as well.

I’m not sure if this is related but I’ll put it anyway: I’ve suffered from undiagnosed depression/suicidal thoughts since I was 12 due to verbal abuse by my mother’s ex-husband (that was the initial reason, but other things happened that have caused it to be worse and it was continued until he died 2 years ago). 

This behavior of mine started when I begun dating an ex, and only got worse after. 

I did take a step in the right direction last week by deleting an account off Facebook solely dedicated to the cyber-stalking and logging out of a few other accounts on other platforms, but I still have the ?compulsion? to do it and today I gave in with a old account that I don’t use anymore [deleted that one too right after]. 

Any help, suggestions, etc. would be greatly appreciated since I know this is an issue. I don’t want to relapse, and create new accounts for cyber-stalking. I want to know if this could be a disorder I have or something else, and if I should see a specialist for it as the title says.

Which makes things even harder; all it takes is one interaction with someone and they decide they know me

They decide I am guilty of something and I am so horrible and unfair to other people, that I act like an Elite or a God or something.

Honestly I am done with trying, at least if I never try, I can never expect to go anywhere, and I can save myself from a devastiting fall from a Manic spell to a Depressed Spell",16Sep2019,3

They all had didferent motive on top of clinical depression. They don't get what I'm going through though. I have wanted to kill myself since at least 3rd grade (13yrs old RN). My parents have tried to cheer me up and encouraged me to get a girlfriend. I would love to get a girlfriend and many girls that I like have asked me out. The reason I turn them down is because when I kill myself I dont want them to think it had anything to do with them.

Several years ago i had made them a promis that I wouldn't self harm, and if I wanted to I would tell them so they can help. I didn't do that and broke my promise to them. I know i need help this time or else its going to continue. But im afraid that I tell them I will lose them. Any one have advice on how to go about this.

61,"To be more clear, here's an example of the type of situation that would leave me feeling depressed for a long time;
 
Let's say I get into a debate with a friend in public, with other friends watching. We both make good points throughout the conversation, but right at the end he makes some sort of condescending, snappy remark that gets the audience to laugh at me before we part ways.

That throws me into an extremely harsh mental state for a really long time. It makes me feel like I can't go back to being normal until I get an opportunity to one-up him the next time we meet. Like, there's this switch in my mind that gets flipped back to normal if things end on a good note for me the next time I encounter that same friend, but in the time that I'm alone, my default state becomes depression.

It's weird because I'm driven to find that friend again in order to flip my mental state back to normal, but if I'm already in a good state, I'll go out of my way to avoid them for fear of my sadness coming back.

The latest (real) situation happened when I was playing with some friends in an online FPS. Basically, one of them told me that someone was coming from my left and that I heard him, but I didn't react and just continued to stare right. I say his voice obscured my hearing, he says I heard him  before and after he started talking (which was correct). Then I just say that I didn't think the guy would vault through the window.

Now I'm back to my sad state and its just miserable. I don't know how I can just ""get over"" stuff like this. It's just constantly irritating and always at the forefront of my mind.",16Sep2019,1

64,"Always felt so alone even with so many friends and family. I suffer from 21 years of undiagnosed ADHD and anxiety disorder. Many of my childhood memories are very...spotty, hazy, and dream like. I'm sure many of my dreams have blended into my memories... My mind has always been all over the place and now that I have been trying to become more aware and put myself together these days, I realized how crazy I actually sound objectively.

I've always just been a big bag of extreme emotions, exhaustion, and distraction.. To the point that I really don't know who I really am or what i like or what i to do. The older i become i feel more experienced yet I've been living the same day for years at a time. These days are much lighter and brighter then my earlier darker days... But i like to think that's because of emotional growth, forgiveness, and self realization.

If you strip away society, faith, day to day life, i really just want to be functional and help others. Typically I can't do those things because of my mental issues. So I'm often contradicting myself and had a habit of beating myself up and losing sanity at times. I mean i use to clench my fists and bang my head etc. However i would never hurt myself or others. I'm just a tormented, lost soul and i can't keep calm and focused long enough to explain that to everyone.

Just a little bit of insight, I haven’t  figured out myself yet completely. I shell up from people and don't usually let much on. Recently I have been opening up to selective persons. I think I have fear of public speaking and I am socially awkward. I have an illustrious  imagination  and can stitch up a story on the blink of eye with zero capsizable holes in the plot. 

Yesterday, I lied after a few years to protect someone I care about. And the people bought my actions and my words pretty readily. I manipulated them by making them feel bigger and goving them satisfaction.....it always works. For manipulation,  I maintain a rule....that is I dont manipulate people that I care about for my own gain. Because: doing that to close people hurts my conscience I dont like that.

What I am concerned about is.... After such hard work I think I will realise how I can get away with most stuff and keep on lying. I dont want that, about my yesterday's action I dont feel guilty at all.

69,"Um, hi there. First time here. I’ve been stuck in my head for a few days and i was curious if anyone else has ever been here before. These are the most plaguing thoughts, though they are random. I guess my big question with all this is, what do I do?

- am I depressed? Like really? Or am I just faking it? Like is this all some elaborate scheme I have cooked up for attention or something? Maybe it’s not actually real. I’ve just told myself that it is for so long that I believe it. Can I give myself depression?

- sometimes I self harm. Not because I want to kill myself. Sometimes it’s because I’m freaking out and it calms me down. Other times it’s because I can’t stop thinking about it. “Just put your arm in the pan for a second, do it! Just do it!” What’s that all about? Is that normal? Also, I never talk about that because I’m 30 and self harm is a teenage issue right? 

- I’m pretty sure something is wrong with me. I just can’t see it. I’ve never dated anyone. Not really. I’ve never been on a proper date. And I’ve only had sex once. (With a friend, super casual. Like 4 years ago). But when I was younger when I would ask a boy out (through someone else usually) if they said yes I was terrified. Like run the other direction when I saw them in the hall. At this point I figure I’m going to be celibate and alone for the rest of my life so I might as well saddle up and get on with it. So broken, yes?

- I’ve never been to therapy. I think sometimes, I should go. But then I worry. How do I know I can trust the therapist? Like I hate my job. And most people I know hate their jobs. So why would this person be any different? Why should I trust that they actually have my best interest at heart and they aren’t just there to get paid. And how do I know they aren’t going to prescribe something or diagnose me just to get me off their back? It just seems like I can’t really trust them. And I also can’t trust myself. What if I just tell them all the things they want to hear? Or the things I think I should say. What should I say? If I say it all is that to bold and forward like oh man, she obviously has read a lot of articles and is just saying what she saw. But if I’m reclusive about things then I’ll never change. It’s a real conundrum. 

-sometimes I don’t know what I feel. Maybe it’s nothing. I get lost in my head sometimes. But I can be distracted by outside influences. Like I can be “happy” when put in the right situation. But is it real? It’s hard to explain. 

- I enjoy watching movies and documentaries about mental health and suicide. I often find myself drawn to these type of things when I feel the darkness coming back.  Is that strange?

- I hate showers. Ugh. I don’t want to shower unless I have to. And sometimes I don’t even do it then.. I just wear a hat. But like I’ll make myself shower if I know someone is going to notice. Not that they would be like “oh are you okay?” They’d be more like “um, you’re gross” and that’s probably true. 



I know that was a bunch of gibberish. I honestly just need to feel heard I think. I don’t know what to do. Are these things normal? And I just overthinking it all? Am I just a lazy bastard who can’t get it together so I make it all up? Is it real?",16Sep2019,1

As the title implies, I think I'm ruining my life. First some background information if its even needed, I've always dealt with issues regarding my mental health and general wellbeing. I've been on and off medications and in and out of counseling since I was a kid. My mental state hasn't ever completely gotten in the way of me living my life until now. I used to be able to ""deal"" with it. Sure, I've alway had feelings of loneliness, depression and self hatred but I could still put on a smile and get through my day. I recently started college and have had difficulty adjusting socially. I spend 90% of my day alone, and my fear of rejection keeps me from making new friends. I pushed away the love of my life. I couldn't accept the fact that he wasn't in a place to care about me like he wanted and didn't feel things like I did. The one man who could make me forget about my problems and truly enjoy being myself barely makes small talk with me now. All of this has led me to where I am now. I'm in a strange and uncomfortable place in my life. I'm trying to sort things out but I keep making all the wrong choices. I don't know what's wrong with me or why I act the way I do. I take criticism too personally and lash out at people. I push them away and try and make them feel bad for doing so. My mental state has completely taken over my life and the person who I used to be. I've become so angry, vindictive and spiteful to myself and others. I treat people like shit because I hate myself and then get upset with myself for acting that way leading to the process to start over again. Im actively digging myself into a hole I'm not sure I can get out of. I've let my insecurities take control and either don't care or don't see other peoples issues. I'm ruining friendships and purposely isolating myself. I'm afraid I'll be stuck in this cycle of self hatred, anger and jealousy forever until I finally give up and do something I can't take back. I don't know what's wrong with me or how to help myself. I don't want to make excuses for my actions anymore. I desperately want to be a better person and put effort into changing my life, for my sake and that of others. I want to love and care for people again and finally love myself. 

TL:DR - My mental illness has taken over my life and my actions and I hate myself and other people because of it

72,"A little worried I have DID. I don’t think I do, but thought it best to share why I’m considering the idea. It is distressing me a little. 

I’ve always suffered with anxiety and had bouts with depression, particularly when I was grieving the loss of my mother figure from 2015-2018. 

Off to uni soon, I’m in a good place emotionally and mentally. I’ve really grown into myself &amp; this has resulted in many of my anxieties dissipating. I feel in control, strong &amp; content in life.

I do believe there is something going on with me. I believe I either am mildly Aspergers or Autistic, school doctor said as much when I was growing up.

Or ADHD. Again school doctor said as much. 

I know I’m okay regarding the former. My brother is Autistic and my mother is suspected of having it, I know that if I do have it it’s no different than the 22 years I’ve spent already, so I don’t care enough to find out really. But the ADHD would make a lot of sense &amp; it’s something I do think if I do have it is reasons for why I struggle with things like sleep, controlling my irritability towards people &amp; my self discipline overall. 

I’ve been reading stories from someone who has DID through reddit/ theMighty and it got me thinking. 

I largely feel like one person, but I don’t at the same time. It’s very weird and I can remember having this feeling on and off for years. I very often refer to myself internally as ‘we’, not all the time, but I do catch myself using ‘we’ a lot, particularly if I’m giving myself a ‘talking to’. You know the typical ‘we’ve really gotta sort our shit out’ ‘how are we going to solve this problem (name)’ 

Years ago, probably from a meme or something, I read a question that was something like ‘if your brain can give you thoughts you don’t agree with then who are you?’ Something like that. Basically just the concept that our brain allows us to think of thoughts but it isn’t necessarily what we believe, which logically means that our brain isn’t exactly us. Unfortunately I’m either not smart enough or haven’t researched enough to understand/ explain this phenomena but it’s probably a big reason I see myself as a plural. Even though i accept I’m a single person. 

I have memory gaps in childhood, but I don’t have memory gaps normally. A lot of m life is foggy until anything at all reminds me and then I have no problem pulling them all up. I’ve got a lot of sad memories as a kid from what I can tell, mainly over my dad not being involved, but nothing abusive that would result in DID as far as I know. I come from a loving but small and ultimately dysfunctional family. 

I struggle with sleep a lot and for a while recently I used to have a ritual that there were hundreds of ‘little me’s running around keeping my brain going, and to convince my brain to shut off and stop thinking, I’d have to pull them all into a large court like area and tell them all we’re going to sleep for the night. After like a fortnight or so this stopped working as I became desensitised as I do with all methods of shutting my brain down eventually. 

as I’ve mentioned when I give myself a talking to I see myself as multiple people with different viewpoints. But it’s not multiple different people. It’s all me. Just different little versions, kind of like emotions. For instance if I fall out with a friend, in my head I’ll imagine it as angry me debating with sympathetic me on whether we’re cutting out the friend or patching things up. This feels healthy and normal to me but perhaps it’s not. It allows me to get all my points across when I have multiple opinions on a single person/ event. 

I’d like to think I have an active imagination, so perhaps I’ve just found a method of dealing with things internally that works for me. Does this sound like DID or is this normal?",16Sep2019,1

I mean, like sleeping 12 hours straight, and I woke up tired anyway. During September/October for the last 5 or 6 years, I have this really weird sleeping pattern.

82,"  Hello, I need help, it is the first time I ask because I felt that people would not understand my situation well and they would be able to help me, but there has come a point where I have to contrast this with someone. To give some context I am 28 years old and I have the same group of friends since I have memory. The problem I have is, or at least I am experiencing, as a real nightmare and it is leading me to a state of helplessness and inability to act in front of this and this is affecting me in my day to day. My problem is that since I was a child and I had communication problems I had always had very small groups of friends and they never changed because it was such a stressful situation for me to open up to new people than at the moment when I got someone to accept me and I anchored in those relationships. Recently I have been diagnosed with a type of paranoid personality disorder that has finally give some explanation to many of the things that I have experienced throughout my life. My problem is that because my personality has changed a lot in adulthood, my relationship with my friends has changed a lot. My group of friends have obviously noticed how I change and my relationship with them has changed, this is something that has taken me many years to assimilate, but in the end I have achieved it and understood that it is normal and I have adapted to these changes but since some time something is changing and I am not able to find the right way to act. The problem is that recently I am becoming a joke and I am being ridiculed by my friends and this is getting worst and worst. I think the problem is that I wasn’t able to stop it the first time it happened and now it has normalized that people can laugh at me and disrespect me continuously and also making fun of things that really affect me such as when I find myself little more disoriented (because of the disorder that I mentioned before). I would understand that they did not want to spend as much time with me as before or that the relationship changes as it has done but I am unable to handle the situation of being an object of mockery. I suppose that the first advice that comes out when I tell this situation is to let them know how I feel, but I already do this and it is a matter of days until they come back to talk to me and behave with me from top to bottom and not unilaterally as I understand It happens in normal friendships. Meeting new people for me is really difficult and I don't really know what to do. This may not be a big problem for you and you think I am exaggerating, but in my situation this is leading me to a really worrying and almost dangerous state.

84,"So like, people tend to say 'oh no one will miss me when I die and im all alone anyway so it won't make a difference.'

Stop it

I'm not gonna be like those inspirational quotes that say something like 'people will miss you' or something like that.

Let's think of it this way.

You kill yourself. You then end up in a void. You can follow your friends and family as a ghost, and you can walk with them, wherever you guys go.

But here's the thing, ...

They can't see you. They can't talk to you. You can follow them and speak to them, but you can't get a reply from them. Imagine living in a place where no one can hear you or see you.

People reading might say 'oh that would just be like how it was when I was alive'.

That's the dumbest thing ever.

Even if no one talks or hangs out with you when you're alive, at least you can attempt to talk to them. At least you can expect to be seen or heard.

When you're dead, you can't do that.

So suck it up, and push through those negative thoughts people.

85,I'm a full time college student and I'm also working 2 jobs on campus. I worked late last night and got up today and just felt so exhausted.  I just wanted to stay home and relax because I  felt so overwhelmed and stressed out. I puked this morning and I think that's why. I drove to campus but then turned around and came home. I feel so bad about it. I hate missing class and worry that I'll fall behind. I also hate calling into work. I convince myself that it's not that bad and I'm being a baby about skipping and don't deserve to stay home. I think I need to find good destressers because I get so overwhelmed and work myself up about how busy I am. Does anyone have any tips for maintaining mental health when you're so busy?,16Sep2019,15
86,"Hey, I’ve just turned fifteen and began my 10th year in highschool. I’m currently living in NY. Last year was my start to highschool and my first school was the best one I’ve ever been to. Not because the school was great, just the people that made it up such as teachers, friends, etc. Not administrators though. We’ll get into that later. I came directly from a private middle school with all my friends and was a class clown and popular beyond my wildest dreams. It was a private all girls school that I got accepted into. No, I didn’t do drugs, alcohol etc. I barely even hung out on the weekends and the only time I let out my extroverted side was at school. I’m a big ambivert. So yeah, fast forward to December of great times on the bus and making memories during school and laughing our heads off the administration pulled me out of class and told me to withdraw. I’ve never been so dumbfounded in my life even though we saw this coming from a mile away. My mom talked them into giving us another month because moving and moving schools was gonna be way to much of a hassle and it was very sudden. My VP told me straight up it was for my mother, not me while I was wiping my tears after balling my eyes out the whole meeting as soon as my guidance counselor pulled out the withdrawal note. I was sent back to class upset and we went from there, and I didn’t tell a soul what happened until it was over. The next month was great as usual and  the event slipped my mind. We were given a contract that said it i boost my grades (I was failing three classes) come prepared to PE, etc., I will be able to stay at the school. The thing is they painted this contract and at the meeting to make it appear as if id be permanently allowed to stay if I could do these things by the end of the quarter. What we didn’t notice was the contract had said something like at the end of the last quarter, I’d be kicked out of school. But we gave it the benefit of the doubt and signed anyways although my mother and I knew this was very sketchy. Here comes the end of last quarter where everything comes down and all questions are answered. I pass all my classes with a 70 GPA. All my teachers like me and none had problems with me. Positive comments only. Few absences. I toned down myself at school and would promise myself to do so if I stayed. Nothing that broke the contract or would give them reason to kick me out. Friday comes, we have a day off but I go to school with an art project I worked on the night before and I thought I would ask them to give it to my art teacher early. I was proud of it and they took it. No compliments or did anyone say anything about it. Woohoo! One minute into the meeting my VP says “I’d appreciate if you stop calling my phone.” HUH??? Okay. Uh. Cool. I told her I didn’t because I didn’t and my mom said it was her. I was, to say the least, appalled st how unprofessional that is and how I have to suffer at the hands of this idiot. But whatever. It’s fine, we all make mistakes. She then says “I hope you do well at whatever school you go to” tying the wishful thinking I had that I was gonna stay. I’m so silly. My guidance counselor who didn’t appear at the meeting got us into this mess. She told my mom on the phone she has the power to get me expelled and they were practically butting heads. I’m thankful for my mom standing up and doing so much  for me. Anyways, they pull out the withdrawal letters and boot me. I ask why and she says because you signed the contract and the school doesn’t match my personality. Ok lol. Cool! That’s gonna help me when I go home and ball my eyes out again! I don’t remember the context but I also told her she couldn’t care if i was expelled or not or what I say or what happens to me because I’m not at the school anymore. She nastily nodded at me. Wowie I’ve never had such a vivid memory. So we sign the papers and leave. Yes they expelled me but didn’t put a reason for it and made it appear as a withdrawal which is the only thing I could thank them for. It could’ve messed up my future big time but it’s so ridiculous I could get it repealed. Anyways I leave, FaceTime friends and message them and they post their stories of how they miss me and I cry at every single one. Two weeks later I enroll in a public highschool locally to finish up the ninth grade and we moved Upstate NY to my school I wish they could be permanent. My grades were dropping throughout the public school phase and there was my moms old friend that had strong ties that got me in the school. I would t have been in it without him. Bless his soul. We went on off for the rest of ninth grade at if i was gonna go to this school or not and I eventually got accepted with five week academic probation which is where we are now. I’m two weeks into school and have made a total of three friends I can call my own which I’m fine with. I’m friendly with everyone but have extreme trouble being myself and I’m looking at old memories and every time I wake up I think about my old school. I literally think about it 10 times a day at my new one and try not to cry. I skipped today and last week because of it. This is extremely extremely extremely bad because if I miss this many days they’re gonna kick me out to. But I can’t help it honestly. I’m barely walking on thin ice and losing my old school did a number on me such as distress and anxiety. I might most likely have depression. Although I w been treated so bad I’d do anything to go back to that school although I’ve moved upstate and schools twice. I know it will all end eventually but I’m not gonna get the same memories I would’ve in my highschool years than with my friends. I do think realistically and my best thing to do right now would to be work hard in this school but I can barely even go to school and get out of my bed in the morning. I feel like I’ve failed so badly because I’m letting down the people that sacrificed and worked hard for me just to be depressed and not even going to school. Literally, I cant even name a worse waste of time than myself right now. The only thing keeping me going is internet and online friends and I’ve cut ties and made a new Snapchat so I don’t have to see friends from my other school having fun while I’m trapped atm. They message me often saying what’s up and where I am but I feel one hundred times worse when I talk to them thinking of all the memories we’ve had together. I haven’t told my mom, my counselor or like anyone besides reddit because I don’t know if this is gonna just be a reason for them to expel me again and I’m not trusting the people who didn’t even want me in the school to begin with. My mom does everything for me but we have our moments. It’s been normalized even though it may sound fudged up we still love each other. All of my siblings dealt with it and they’re either successful or famous. The only time it’s too far is when she threatens me to call the cops saying I threatened to kill myself even though that’s literally the dumbest thing to do. She just did this this morning when I locked my door when I was supposed to be getting ready. No she doesn’t threaten this normally at all. I’m not feeling suicidal at all even though I might be depressed. I love my life.. weirdly enough as it sounds even with all these thoughts there’s 24 hours in the day an I’m not thinking about it all of them. Just a lot of them. Like a lot of them. It’s been almost a year but I’m getting even worse even though I should be moving on and getting better. I’ve NEVER met so many amazing people that were supportive sweet funny caring awesome that made me shine and I’d do the same for them. I would do absolutely anything to go back. I was a stupid freshman for a quarter and broke out of it. The reality is that I’m not gonna ever feel the same again and I know that and it won’t be the same as that. It’s s fact. The reality also is that it’s gonna be God’s I don’t believe in work to get me back there. So yeah that’s it. Any thoughts on what I should do? I only seek happiness in the thing that caused my distress in the first place, somethings kinda wrong here.",16Sep2019,3
87,"Recently starting going back to therapy and potentially getting meds since this time it feels worse. I have anxiety and depression and the depression is what’s been getting me lately. The last few months it was tolerable since I had things going on and it was easy to dismiss or not think about at least until I had downtime. Recently my bf of 1.5 years ended things and we had a shaky month of communication until I shut that door completely for my own sake. Honestly since the relationship ended it’s just been down and I don’t feel like me at all anymore. Everything from prior to the end of the relationship just shot up and now all I can think about is just not existing. I don’t have anything planned nor do I think I ever will. I just don’t want to be here and nothing really makes me happy. I honestly feel like I’m never going to be happy or content with life. There’s many other things that I have going on that I think contribute to this but the relationship ending is the one the speaks loudest rn. I’m a little scared to be put on meds if that’s the route taken, (I have a future psychiatric appointment) but I honestly just want to stop feeling this way. I don’t have a history of self harm but I feel so numb and I tried to burn myself in my shower just to see what would happen. I could feel the heat but the pain didn’t feel like it was there, I haven’t done anything with that since or tried again. 
I have moments or days that I feel fine but everything creeps back up and all I want is to just not be here. And with the days that I’m somewhat okay I just feel like I’m here and nothing else. Like I’m just a body doing what its told and not really living. I like to think I’m fairly self aware and know everything should in theory be temporary and things should get better so long as I keep going about my days (reasons why I tried to get help). But I really don’t want to do it anymore, there’s no desire to do anything and if I’m being honest past thoughts of thinking into the future came up and I don’t see myself there.",16Sep2019,0
88,"First things first, I really don't want to hear the ""But you are still so young"" response. Loneliness can hit anyone and the amount of time you've spent on the earth doesn't change anything.

I make attempts at dating pretty frequently but I always end up being rejected ( which doesn't really affect me anymore) or getting played around with and burnt pretty bad (This kinda shit hurts like a son a bitch). I have pretty decent social skills and frequent parties but nothing has happened for me. I feel so alone and alienated. I have good friends and all, but for me friends can only go so far. I think because its the one thing I cant seem to reach is why its driving me insane. My loneliness comes and goes in waves, but recently it just seems to be present all the time.

I understand where he is coming from and I realize I have been talking too much about work (spreading too much negativity). Work has  been the cause of my anxiety and I really didnt know it was annoying to him.

92,"Does anyone else just feel like there’s something completely wrong with them? Like, they seem to just ignore me or not want me around for anything but yet they don’t have the decency to be like “I don’t think we should be friends anymore” or tell me what I even did wrong.
I had a friend who would actively go out of his way to avoid me if at least one of rest of the group (there was 4 of us total) wasn’t there. He would blatantly ignore me when we all hung out and would only talk to the others. For instance, I was cleaning his house and saw some of his video games and was like “oh you like _____?” No response. A few minutes later, one of my other friends brings it up and suddenly he starts talking about it with her. I ended up telling him how the way he was treating me made me feel and once again, I got no response. Said goodbye to him.
Another friend ghosted me for a second time with no warning.
Another friend I said goodbye to today. We had been friends for a long time. Once again, lately would not hang out with me without a group. He would say he’s too busy or too tired to hang out with me. I brought it up to him and he apologized and said he didn’t mean to make me feel like I was unwanted or ignored or anything. After that it got worse. I would text him and ask if he wanted to hang out and I would get no response. The next morning he would say that he was really tired or really busy or whatever, but I knew he was hanging out with other people and just ignoring me.
What is wrong with me that this keeps happening? I can’t deal with it anymore and it really really hurts, and sometimes I honestly just wonder if the world would be better without me in it.
I’m not a dull person. I do have other really good friends (all girls), and typing this all out, I realized that all the friends treating me like crap are guys. I don’t understand it, but it really really hurts and I’m sick of this happening.",16Sep2019,1
93,"I was diagnosed with BPII like seven years ago, and up until April of this year I self-medicated with weed/booze. I have since stopped drinking, and up until about a month ago, things were going great because I wasn't smoking pot either. I have always loved smoking weed, and the only reason I wasn't smoking was because I didn't have anyone to buy from. However, I was able to procure some and I could feel myself falling back into negative thoughts/feelings/habits. I'm taking it out on people who care about me. 

&amp;#x200B;

But, I don't like the idea of not smoking weed. I've been smoking for nearly 10 years now, and I love the physical act, but I hate what it's doing to my mental health. I don't know how to move on from this habit, and at this point I don't want to but I know I have to. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel like I can't get a fucking release without some sort of substance. My meds help regulate my moods but at the end of the day, sometimes I just need something to help wind me down. I don't miss drinking at all, but I feel like I need something or I'll fucking lose my mind.",16Sep2019,13
94,"I had adhd since a little girl, plus some chronic anxiety. Sooner later after moving up in Junior High I got depression, which 3 years later I still experience. My depression led to my dangerous habits, my self harm used to be for coping and punishing myself, now I pick at my skin and hair because of the pleasure and morbid joy I get. I've been constantly panicking around the internet, I can't ever cool down! I think I may be obsessive compulsive, yet I've been worrying about it and theorizing way too much at my age. I feel like my depression and anxiety always followed me, but puberty destroyed my brain. I recently have been developing bad eating habits too, along with body dysmorphia. I'm scared my Mother will be angry and weirded out, I can't stop picking at myself! I even tried burning for scabs, it hurts, but I love pulling and picking my skin. I got ideas from the internet too, but also in a young grade, picking was fun and I would get distracted. I don't want attention but something in my brain makes me feel good for being so strange, even feeling good for creating a good scab to pick.

95,"Hey guys, I consider myself a pretty mentally strong person for the most part. I had a rough upbringing and depression and anxiety in high school, but I feel like I was able to overcome it. Most of my days, I am an incredibly happy person, very productive and proud of who I have become. However, sporadically I will receive immense spouts of anxiety, depression, and overall changes in my mental disposition towards life, politics, religion, socializing, the whole lot. It's as if I'm cast under some melancholic spell for a few days out of the month. My gf has come to accept and expect these things to happen. I eat healthy, I exercise, I don't spend too much time staring at my screen or anything. I've tried journaling to pin down what could cause the spouts of anxiety but I can't. They just seem to come up out of nowhere. When they come, I basically just spend all day on my computer or playing a game. Not because I want to do these things, but because the constant mental attention allows me to ignore my other thoughts. After some amount of days, I break the spell. I feel refreshed, I crave going to the gym. I get excited to cook healthy meals, do my work, and read. I'm an entirely different human being. The mental state that I seem to go in reminds me of how I used to feel about things during high school, when I was depressed.

102,"Hello everyone. I had been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder when I was 18, about 6 years ago. I went through several anti-depressants for the first 2 years, with various issues. The most recent one was promising, and it has kept depression away from me for about 4 years. Though, I noticed about 6 months ago, they slowly started to come back, first with motivation issues, then my energy levels plummeted, my mood worsened, and now I seem to have suicidal ideation again(no plans though... at least yet), and I fear it's just getting worse from here. All of this happened even though I'm still taking the anti-depressant(it's at max-dose already btw).   


The issue is my prescriber doesn't seem to answer my calls anymore for whatever reason, and I'm kind of in a transitional stage to my next one, due to insurance issues and that old prescriber not returning message. I'm worried I won't see someone in time. Does anyone have advice on what I could do? I live in the US btw.",16Sep2019,1

Ever since I was a teen I had a habit of not being able to adhere to therapy for more than a few visits. I've been to maaaanyyy psychotherapists and what not and always quit. I had bad self-esteem problems due to being bullied. Today was supposed to be my 3rd visit (still evaluation), but I had to cancel it for now, because I wanted to say to her that I won't come again. 

I don't know why I'm still trying to go, I feel like I've grown out of most of my issues and became comfortable with some stuff. I'm sick of venting (I have people to vent to), reviving events that happened +5 years ago, telling deeper thoughts to a person I barely know etc. I don't have a diagnosis (insufficient symptoms). I think I can work on most of the issues on my own, just never really tried to.

Every time I come back home from therapy I don't feel relieved - I feel frustrated that I had to tell every single personal detail to a stranger, had to make myself look weird, since you don't go there to talk about flowers, and got basically nothing in return.

108,"I'm struggling with depression pretty badly. It hits at this time of year often. I decided last Spring to go off of my medication. This cycle has been on repeat for 2 or more years now. I always feel like I'll be fine, like nothing bad will happen if I go off my antidepressants, that I'll be happier and healthier not taking something that alters my moods. For the Spring and Summer, it's all good. Then the fall hits. Then I go back to work (teaching). My job isn't even all that bad - I work at a great school with awesome students. But I feel like a failure, like teaching is a crappy profession for people who can't do anything else in life. I feel like I'm wasting my life and my time. I feel full of anxiety. I cry about my job; I cry in general. I miss my family. I'm full of this sorrow and I don't know how to get rid of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't go back on my antidepressants because I threw them all away. I can't afford to go back to the doctor's because my health insurance is crap. I opted for the cheapest one because, starting the school year, I told myself I wouldn't need to go back on medication. I can't afford the $500 medical bill. So, I'll just continue on this way.

Yet i feel guilty for even trying to use it.

Some reasons i thought why i felt guilty: I'll miss lessons, people will question me because i act normal, the teachers will think im just trying to skip, people might think my explanation for it is a lie or i just dont like talking about things nor making my emotions public to people i know or to people who know me.

I got my exit ticket about a week ago because a teacher realised how sad i was in reality compared to my facial expressions.

Ive always been quite dismal: i barely talked to people, i kept changing personalities to fit in but I'd cry at home because of it, i never went outside when i had a break between lessons, i have no real friends at all right now; they all use me for money, food, etc.. 

I cant explain in full because i feel its too personal and that whenever i even say it, think it or even write it down i start crying and shaking.

How do i not feel guilty about using my exit ticket when ive been told off for doing so a few years back?

I wore it for 18 hours total in 1 day (smh) I know that’s so unhealthy but I just love being alone in my own little world and the longer I keep the headset on, the more immersive the experience becomes. I honestly think this will make my social life worse but I just don’t care anymore. I love it in the virtual world so much. It feels safe and more like home than my actual house 😌",16Sep2019,3

I've struggled for over 10 years and been to the point of planning my exit.

But I'm here. I'm a survivor and you are too!

Maybe the video will speak to you,
Maybe it will be something you can share with friends and family who just don't get it.
Maybe you feel you can't share your story, but sharing this may open your friends eyes.

120,"I had my first therapy session today, and I feel alive. Does that sound weird? 

It was mostly a what do I want to get out of the sessions, kinda thing - cause I'm nearly 18, and it's a child mental health service thing (5 - 18), so we only have about 4 months. 

But it was really therapeutic in a way, even if I was just outlining some of my struggles and basic battles I have with myself daily. Some of the things I said, she shook her head at, like when I said I have no reason to be scared of the fights in my house, cause I'm used to it lol. But yeah...

We came to the conclusion together, that I am fed up of being judged, and wanna change that and the hypocracy in my family. I just don't know how. We agreed that fixing that will hopefully mean I dont have the need to hurt myself, or lash out involuntarily. But that's only gonna be noticeable after a while. So can't comment on that right now. 

Overall I feel a bit optimistic and lighter now... I do urge any of y'all struggling to reach out.  To a friend, a stranger, a teacher. Me... Just please ensure you follow basic safety rules, online and off.",16Sep2019,353
121,"Hey, I don’t really know if this is the right sub for this question or not. I was talking with my longtime girlfriend and the conversation came up about our lost loved ones. She became worried about me when I told her that I don’t feel anything when I hear news of a loved one passing. Her dad recently passed, and she was distraught beyond belief. However, people I’ve had close relationships with have passed before, and I feel nothing. I don’t feel sadness, or grief, I just register that they aren’t around anymore, and go back to what I was doing. I’m beginning to worry myself if something is wrong with me. Is there a disorder that would give me a lack of empathy? From what I know, I don’t think I show signs of autism or anything.",16Sep2019,1
122,"I downloaded this app called Pixels (not an ad just found it really helpful) and it has you mark down how you felt every day and displays it in some easy to read graphs. I was thinking the other day that it's weird that I haven't really written any poems or songs lately so I decided to try and figure out why. I've written 2 poems in the last 2 days and decided to look at the dates of when I write things. I've only been tracking for 2 months now but I found out that I write poems in between my cycles of good mood and bad mood. I noticed that I go through cycles of anxiety. Roughly 2 weeks of extremely high anxiety and feeling pretty depressed and then about 2 weeks of lower anxiety and higher confidence. I realized that I write most of my poems in the middle periods between these 2 parts of the cycle. When I'm at the peaks of either part I don't write. When I'm at the lowest part I tend to not feel anything and so have nothing to write about. When I'm at the highest I'm feeling great and have nothing to write about. When I'm in those middle areas I have that perfect mix of feeling and motivation that allows me to write. 

This is all to say that if you're looking to get a better grasp of your mental health give this sort of tracking a try. It can help you find possible triggers or patterns and might give you a better idea about how your mind works. For me, I'm on my phone for work a lot of the day so a mood tracking app works best. For others a short daily journal works. Give it a try and it might help you out a little.",16Sep2019,1
123,"I'm a 15 year old kid, and, in a nutshell, my life is in bits. I feel so out out of touch with everything in the world, I have friends but I'm never taken seriously, my whole teenage life I've been a fucking clown. Tarnishing my character for some laughs, I can't socialise well, to go out with a girl is a miracle. I have not a thing in common, I like games, coding, skateboarding and lo fi. I'll never find anyone like that around my place. I can't find friends that I can properly bond with. There are a group that I love but, as I said, I'm their clown and although they may care I can't ask them to come watch The Joker, I can't ask if they wanna come to a skatepark.

Alot of the time I think of killing myself, I've been in a sad state since I was about 11, wrong friends and a wrong mindset. I only starting thinking about dying at 13. But I'm religious, which os where most my resilience comes. I'm scared to die, not becuase I don't want to, but because I'm scared of what God will think of me. I could never do it myself, I'm too much a pussy. Sometimes, on a bad day, I pray that I get approached by a theif, or kidnapped my terrorists, so they can kill me. And when I'm angry I get agitated, I beg God to kill me, dumb I know. There's been a few times where my life has gone so low that I'm intent on killing myself, I'd have a passion for it and would want it so bad. I don't self harm, farthest I'd go is punching my leg and scratching it.

For a few months I've been documenting my days on notes, speaking to my self day and night. Exclaiming the wonders of today and the fears of tommorow, its ok but I know it won't be an essential stress ball, I so much want for someone to hug me man, to tell me it's okay, someone who understands. I don't want some school therapist bullshit, they say what you want and get paid. I want a normal person to help. I feel so fucking lonely sometimes, I feel so so isolated, I just want someone I can love other than family, because we're from Balkans, they won't understand.

I don't know what to do at this point, I haven't passionately touched a person not from family in years, I know it sounds creepy but it is what it is. I think my personality and body sets my path (I'm a boy), I'm short fat, seemingly ugly, and I'm a clown, plain and simple, about 8 years now I have been. I went with it because I craved that importance, that significance, but now I want tranquility and peace of mind, I'm constantly struck, constantly pushed so I can get out a reaction. The culture of where I am tells you that only two or so friends in the group are the clowns, the rest do their thing. I want to be with people who won't consistently want a reaction. I want love to be honest, a passion.

Schools has been a big factor in my sadness, the massive weight pushed upon me just makes me so hopeless in life. In the UK we have GCSEs, a big exam grading you for future life. I'm dumb, I'm fucking dumb. I'm shit at maths, shit at sociology, shit at science and shit remembering dates for history. I wanted to be a game developer, but it's just another fantasy, my grades are bad and I awake with the fear of unemployment, poverty. So now, I always have the army in the back of my head, crawling around just hoping that I'm dumb enough to go die. That's mostly the point anyway. The army is a quick way to die, not by my hand but by some kid's.

I don't know what I was thinking coming into this subreddit, I guess I'm just a bit worried about my life, and crying and recording isn't helping anymore. I'd just like a person, an actual person to read this, not even to comment but to appreciate what it feels to be right, to live the normal life, normal job, normal friends. Or to just see through the eyes of a kid enclosed in this capsule of deception and lies held down by the expectations of society and other. If you've gotten to the end of this little vent, thank you, very fucking much, I hope you find the better in yourself and are able to care and reform into a better person and a healthier human, I sure as hell am not.

I don't know if anyone else feels this, but the only relief in life I have and letting out everything for the year, just crying for the whole day and looking into the star ridden thinking about the wonders of our universe. I have anger issues, I think I'm bipolar and no one around me will understand my pain, everything I do I look out for its imperfections, I feel everything I get or build never works, I feel I'm dipped in bad luck, that I'm hated and annoying, I want to fucking die man.

I posted this to another reddit because, to be honest, I'm fucking desperate for someone to reply, for some attention to the parts I've hidden to everyone I know in life.",16Sep2019,3

I've been delivering pizzas for two weeks and I actually kind of liked it, but I was paralyzed with depression and anxiety before my shift today. I couldn't go. It's hard to explain. I'm not agoraphobic and I don't have social anxiety. When I'm at work, I'm usually in a good mood. But the fear is debilitating, and now I'm out of another job.

&amp;#x200B;

So I have a 15 yr old friend(F) who seems to be in a very poor mental state and I have been trying to support and listen to F for around a year now.  I believed everything F said because I saw some evidence.  F has anxiety, depression, schizophrenia and is possibly suicidal as I have seen scars but they have refused they are. F also mentioned how their parents don't believe them when it comes to their mental health issues.  

Recently our friend group had a falling out with F and has told me how they think F has been lying about mostly everything, because of things like ""F doesn't act in the same way as most people do with depression"" and other things like that.  At first I was dismissive however I came to realise that I never stood back and evaluated the situation, which I normally do, and now I'm beginning to question what F said and I feel really bad for it. 

I want to talk to F alone and ask if what they said was true and see if I can convince F that therapy and going to see a doctor isn't that bad.

137,"I’ve been having an extremely though time lately with my metal health.

It’s terrifying and it seems that the rest of my body feels out of control and I start screwing up my art projects and grabbing pin needles and start stabbing myself with them.

All I want to do is lay in bed and sleep. I have no motivation, I'm crying all the time. My job sucks, I feel like I have no friends (I have some friends, but they're not super close.) and regardless, I always want to be alone (Unless I had my person which was usually my partner)  Whenever I went through a break up, I would go to my mom's house and relax because it felt comforting.

I have 3 different creditors after me because I have no way of paying them back. I'm barely living paycheck to paycheck because life has become so expensive here.

140,"Hi. I'm not here to write about me. I just want to leave you an important message, hoping that it will help you and, maybe, even save your life.

The message is: If you have a problem, specially if it's considerably affecting your life, you should talk about it to someone you trust as soon as possible. I suggest you talk to a parent or a relative, but if you don't feel helped by them, then talk about it to another adult (for example a therapist, a counselor or, if you're in school age, a teacher) or, generally, a friend. I know, you may feel uncomfortable with it, think it's not worth it, think you don't deserve it, think you have to do by yourself, but please, if you are suffering, TALK. You deserve help, no matter what.

Asking for help is NOT a sign of weakness, it's a sign of strength. If you feel it's too much to go through it alone, don't be afraid of seeking help. If you don't get the help you need once, remember that it's not your fault, and look for it somewhere else. Trust me, there's someone who can lessen your burden out there.

And, most of all, be kind to yourself. Other people can take care of you, but you also have to learn how to take care of yourself.

With love, Joodibox",16Sep2019,17

142,"I live underwater, far in the middle of the ocean, all alone, fighting to stay alive. That’s what living with my mental illnesses feels like. 

I am constantly fighting just to get to the surface for a breath of air. I hold onto that air for as long as possible, the fight once again to get to the surface. Now being on meds and in therapy have helped, they’re like little oxygen masks that help me get through the day, but I still have to fight every single day just so I don’t drown. 

But as dismal as this seems, and as exhausting as it is, there are moments of relief. When a friend checks up on me and lends me a hand, when the storms stop for a moment and the waves cease, when there’s a glimmer of hope to hold on to. There are moments like this every so often, and they have helped keep me alive.

So when I say I’m fighting to stay alive I mean it. Every day I keep fighting, keep trying to get to the surface, keep trying to stay afloat. And there are some days that are awful, that it seems nearly impossible. Days where I feel like I have weights tied to my legs pulling me down, days where I’m in the middle of a hurricane getting pounded by enormous waves, days where sharks are circling and waiting for my ultimate demise. 

You never know how hard someone is fighting just to breath. You never know what they are carrying on their shoulders. You also never know how much simple small acts of kindness can help them in those moments. Be kind. Be helpful. Look for opportunities to bless those around you.

145,"Hi Reddit, this may be a bit of a read but thank you for anyone willing to take the time to read or comment. 
I don't know how to start other than to jump straight in. I've had a bit of a rough run since a young age and I think things have been catching up. I'll make note of my emotions as I go if I can and I apologize if this is unclear, but I feel concerned about my emotional state and my mental stability. Any help would be appreciated more than you realise. Thank you all.

I lost my dad around 15 due to bladder cancer. It's horrible to watch loved ones deteriorate due to such a condition so I won't go into details but suffice to say our entire family suffered with him just trying to get him through, though he never complained about the pain or illness or anything. He was quite humble in his final years about it all and I wish he knew how proud I am of him for how he looked at the situation. When he passed, I didn't cry much. I more looked to mum and made sure she was okay as best I could. It wasn't till later when my sister realised I hadn't been crying and she asked me about it that I cried and was hit by what happened. I figure this somewhat normal or maybe even instinct as a son but it's noteworthy considering my concerns. The hospital didn't inform us of what we we're entitled to in terms of support. It was kind of a s**t show as the regular doctors we had were off work at the time and the ones filling in had no real information about dad's condition.

Skip forward quite a while and mum was to go back to work (she was considered too young for a widow's pension) and I had to go back to school (had been homeschooled the previous two years after moving for my father's health) for my final two years of schooling. I went in having no idea how to socialise, how to talk to girls (that part was an absolute nightmare), I had a completely different curriculum and didn't even know how to do basic trigonometry. I fell in with a few people who I considered good friends, however the group was drama laden and I usually tried to help people fix the issues they had. Around this time I really noticed my normal nervousness kick into overdrive to the point of anxiety. I also felt more commonly sad and often dealt with depression within my friend circle.
Around before Christmas, a female friend of mine (we'll call her Amy to keep her identity secret but to be able to refer to her) was having some issues. She was going out with a guy that was supposedly talking his ex girlfriend. She'd talk to me about it but in the end they worked it out and just went back to friends. We all spent a relatively uncomfortable night in the school holidays at her house. I shrugged off that feeling and tried to just have fun.
The next morning I woke up early and went outside and spoke to Amy's mother for quite a while. A good hour and a half or so. We talked about a lot of things but I don't remember much. Amy woke up later and joined us. Later when her mother went to work, she started telling me things had happened the previous night and that this guy had raped her and that she didn't know what to do and she felt that she didn't want to be here anymore. I had no idea what to do. I told her no matter what I had her back and that I cared and that she needed to stay here. Whatever she needed, I'd do it to help. He left later for work when he woke up. He didn't say much.

Something noteworthy before this next part, she also told me I had muttered that he was a rapist under my breath when I walked inside and he was there. Though I very clearly remember the moment, but not doing that.

Later that year between stressing out from looking after Amy and dealing with this situation full time, just trying to keep her here and help her, trying to maintain grades in school, and what seemed like an unending list of trouble; I realised I was operating on nothing. I had nothing but constant anxiety including sensory overload and panic attacks. When I wasn't anxious, I was severely depressed to the point I had been starting to self harm lightly. I had been that depressed (minus the self harm) for at least months and I had no idea when it specifically had started. A month or so after that realisation I planned to, at some point, commit suicide. I had no detailed plan as of yet. I just wanted to leave. One night, I said my goodbye to Amy when I thought she was asleep. She wasn't. She messaged my friend that lived closest to me and he got there before I did anything serious. I was thinking about how to start a note when he arrived.

After my mum found out on that night she spoke to me, and I agreed to see the school counselor. I explained everything to the counselor. I had noticed at this point that Amy had been making less and less contact with me, even avoiding me and saying I'd been doing more things I didn't remember. She even started hanging out with the guy that had raped her. I felt crazy and insecure and was between anxiety and disbelief. I brought the whole situation up with the counselor and she said to give Amy space, and to give her (the counselor) some time to think on the matter and that she'd come see me.
Later that day I think it was she came back to see me and sat me down in a seperate class room. She explained that Amy had BPD and that she also didn't know about it. She briefly explained it but I was mostly shocked. I still felt crazy. I even asked if she was sure it wasn't me and she confirmed it wasn't. She told me to keep my distance from her and be very careful, and that if I was in a situation where I had to communicate with her I should try and have someone there to witness. But to not tell people as it needed to be handled delicately.
Several weeks later, the police came to my house when I was out helping my family move regarding an incident at school where I had reportedly 'verbally abused Amy and grabbed her arm, cutting her with my nails'. My Mum spoke to the police but the woman in charge was apparently a bit after my blood. They left and mum filled me in later. I went to the counselor who I believe contacted the police (as it's a school issue, they are supposed to speak to the school itself I believe) about the issue. The issue was apparently on school photo day and thankfully because of where I had been on that day (all populated areas of the school) I had an alibi and witnesses. I don't know how the issue was reported other than she supposedly had a witness. I have no idea if this was testified by someone from school or just that she said someone had witnessed it.
Several tense months later the issue died down and was mostly handled by the counselor and was monitored until the end of school. I cannot safely talk to my former friend Amy in any way but I think of her from time to time and hope she is doing well and that however her BPD can be helped, it is. I have no idea to this day if she knows.
Important: I also do not wish to paint people with  BPD wrongly. They are not terrible people in my eyes. Just extremely unfortunate. Apparently BPD people have much instability within their lives and I feel extremely compassionate about it. I deeply empathize with it through my own experience. 

Much after high school ended, my girlfriend of one and a half years and I split up. I had always loved her dearly even if the relationship had become toxic. We had never slept together (she had valid reasons) in that one and a half years but I was accepting of it and I still loved her a lot at the time and was not coping, even sending possibly the worst drunk messages I could have to her (I'd prefer to not repeat them). Two or three weeks after the breakup a friend of about 6 years called and told me they'd been seeing each other for about a week. I hung up and wound up flipping a table and punching the wall (only missing the stud behind it because my fist glanced off from the angle I was at after flipping the table). I called back and questioned my 'friend'. He said he didn't want to lose a friend over it and began to justify his own actions. I told him they had 24 hours to figure out if my friendship was more important than seeing each other. I called my mum for guidance, only to find out he had messaged her about seeing my ex. I was so livid I had to take the day off work. It got to the point where I was yelling at the roof.
So basically the next day, my ex girlfriend said she loved him. I told them they were both dead to me, they had f****d me up and to never contact me again. I also found out a couple of months later that she wound up sleeping with him. 
At this point it created a lot of problems for me mentally. I lost sexual drive, confidence, I was depressive and very angry, I often suffered from nightmares already but now had nightmares about them sleeping together, and it became very hard to get sleep between the nightmares and working late hours. 

Around this time I was getting close to a female friend of mine. I had known her since school and she had become probably my best friend. We were so close that when she had barely any internet we would email once a day to keep contact. I didn't really know what I'd do without her. We lived apart but we'd planned to move in together where she was living. I wanted to pursue a career and start fresh away from everything. Everything was great and honestly I really cared for her. I basically wound up telling her before she came up but she knew I'm not really the sort to push something. If she just wanted friendship then that was really cool too. The question of what was happening was left open and she came up. We had a wonderful two days and she drove home on the third. She began to tell me she was asexual (if I'm remembering correctly) and spoke about how it would affect me if anything happened between us. I tried to understand it but I found it hard to grasp but from what I could it didn't really bother me. After losing the drive for that kind of thing I had no real issue with that.
After a few days she started being rude to me about what had been going on and I told her what she'd been saying was unfair. I explained that I can't read her mind, I'm not omniscient and that she couldn't expect me to understand her sexuality straight away as it was a totally new concept to me. I said if there was a problem then she had to tell me what it was instead of all this. I said I didn't want to talk for a while. A few brief and confusing text conversations later, she sent me money (I don't know why) that I tried to decline and said she didn't want to speak to me again. She's now moving in with a friend of mine from school. I was lost for the description of the negativity I felt. I had not only lost my best friend, I lost my chance at a fresh start. And I have to watch one of my good friends have it now.

Very recently my ex girlfriend came to my workplace with some school friends. She stayed outside but I had her come in as it was raining and I felt it was wrong to leave her out there. I asked the manager for 10-15 minutes and took her out back. I had no idea what to say. I had not planned anything. I was angry, without closure, sad, anxious, tired after work, impatient. I just told her ""talk"". She apologized to me for everything, explaining she understands that what she did was wrong and that she hurt me. She apologized knowing she put me in a bad place and for going through with it despite how fresh the breakup was. She could barely stop herself from crying and I could see genuine pain. I tried not to look at her, mainly I think because I had wanted to see her hurt for so long but I now couldn't stomach it even if I was angry. I hugged her somewhat reluctantly and said it's okay. I explained that we needed to have a long talk. I forgave her, but explained I may not want her in my life at all.  
I had that conversation the next day, and to some degree found closure. I still however refuse to speak with my ex best friend of 6 years. My life has been infinitely better without him.

That is my story (with much taken out so as not to bore you). 
At current I am surviving mentally, but I'm deeply troubled by my state of mind. 
Apart from what I have written, I am very desensitised to sadness, instead feeling an emptiness or apathy, and I'm very cold and logical with small issues. I react different to most people in that way. I have found sexual drive but still struggle to want sexual contact. It is also very difficult to trust people or to feel safe regarding the idea of a partner or a relationship and although I analyse people constantly I often feel I can't read someone in a one on one situation. I still have trouble sleeping and still have nightmares about previous events often.
Very occasionally I also question my sanity and have a slight lack of regard for my own wellbeing. I feel disconnected and almost like I shouldn't be here. Like me being here is something that didn't quite go to plan and the world doesn't know what to do with me.
I have also been asked by people if I am either Asperger's or on the spectrum for Autism although I am not aware that I am, though my mum, her boyfriend, and my sister have wondered if I have something along those lines.

Please help in any way you can. I very much appreciate it.",16Sep2019,1

148,"for as long as i can remember ive been incapable of what i describe to myself as 'true' happiness, and putting on this comedic jovial facade on. doing this helps distract myself from the pain i feel by making others laugh and be happy. but this has all fell down after my family left me alone in the house without telling me where they are and when theyd be returning until roughly 11 o'clock, leaving me worried and quite frustrated and angry. i lost my temper and started punching and kicking about my room, leading to my drunk mother attempting to shout at me. in my anger i screamed at her and she resulted in hitting me and pushing me down. i was quickly 'saved' by another slightly more reasonable family member who pulled me into another room and spoke to me about it and i let alot of what hurts me out, and she understood considering her own mental health issues. but my mother didnt hear any of this and hasnt been told, and im terrified to tell her, and our relationship has been constantly down-hill since then, the same has been happening with my father. and i seem to have lost that facade and have become a mostly-depressed lump of anger and have found myself bringing others down more. ive been experiencing alot of suicidal thoughts and desires, and have no idea what to do. to make things worse im struggling with my sexuality, which is just another part of what makes me so miserable. currently im staying in my fathers but as i said relationships here are deteriorating, and ive just been told not to return to my actual home. i dont know what im supposed to do.",16Sep2019,1
149,"For context, I am a 19M in the UK and that I have Aspergers’ Syndrome. 

I was diagnosed with Aspergers’ Syndrome when I was around 13-14, my mum wanted me tested because I had heavy anger issues and she knew that something wasn’t quite right, and then “bam, Aspergers’ Syndrome”

Recently for the past 2-3 years, I’ve been in constant routine and I do not like change one bit unless I can adjust to it. But recently in the past months I cannot leave without making sure that my switches are off, the windows are shut, my iPad is in a safe place, and that make sure the back door is locked and then when I leave, making sure the gate is locked repeatedly and that the side door is locked repeatedly. I do this even if I go to the shop which is a 2 min walk and back, it’s getting unbearable and I cannot break it. 

And with the main issue, I cannot stop making sure the gate is locked, I smoke frequently and have to go in the garden as my parents don’t smoke, but with making sure that the gate is locked when I come back in has broken and I still do it now, the time I go out for a cig is usually when I parents are either in the shower or bath and that they can me slamming the gate.

I will be ultra paranoid and will stress about it, thinking “oh god did I shut it” and “did I even lock it?!” I cannot break this routine, my mum has just yelled at me recently for lying as I said the gate just slammed but she heard me slamming the locked gate to make sure it’s locked. I cannot get myself for work or college, I am not independent, and I am paranoid if I break routine and that if I do break it, “the worst will happen”

I don’t know if any of this will make sense to anyone but I desperately need help, and I don’t want to sound crazy or anything, but I think a random thought that seems weird or evil, I’ll cover my hand over my mouth, yawn and repeat a code word to myself thinking that karma wouldn’t get me. I am utterly terrified of myself, I do not know what to do and I need everyone if anyone’s help.

152,"My truth.... where to start??? I dread boredom, I'm always searching for an escape, I tend to eat when I'm bored, and I'm bored a lot, doesn't help that I'm at home all day, I have read so many articles on depression but none of them resonates with what I'm going through, I don't feel hopeless, not all the time, I tried to end it a couple of years back, but it was more to do with my own failures than anything else. How do I feel?? Mostly tired, I know I don't like it quiet, I can't have my bath without music blaring otherwise my mind drifts off to places unknown, and I end up spending 20 minutes just standing still washing the same section. Therapist is not an option, mainly because of where I live and I'm scared of being comitted. My dad has been locked up in a mental facility for more than 5 years, the doctors say it is schizophrenia, is that my diagnosis as well?? 

No one around me seems to know what is going on, I seem fine on the outside, I know depression comes in phases, this seems different this is always with me, its my constant state of mind, I'm sure I'm not bipolar, I don't feel fluctuations,  yes some days are worse than others, When its really bad, I only get out of bed to eat. on good days I actively search for an escape.  How do I get through most days? Weekdays are the worst, Fortnite helped for a while I met a couple of guys online and they were really funny and I was happy for a while, we played most evenings for a couple of months till the game stopped doing it for me. Laughter is the only cure I've found, for that few seconds you are happy and you forget everything else, that's why I watch a lot of stand up. The gist of it is everyday I need an escape, something to fully immerse myself in, a task that keeps my mind focused, or a movie, a game, a tv show that completely takes over my world. My weekends are a bit better I watch football all day and it does the trick. 

Does anyone else have similar struggles?? I just need to know what is wrong with me, maybe then I can try to fix it, definitely don't want to end up like my dad. Is it ADHD, Clinical Depression, Early stages of Schizophrenia??",16Sep2019,1
153,"I see people often talk about being there if someone wants to talk. When I was suicidal, I thought of all the people that had said the same thing to me, that they're there for me if I need them. I needed them, but I never called, never messaged. When you're feeling like you don't want to live anymore, you don't want to bother anyone and you don't feel like you matter. If you have to keep asking for help, which is fucking hard to begin with, it just reinforces those ideas on your head.

So if someone tells you they've been thinking of suicide, check on them. Make them feel like like they're not alone and you think of them throughout the day.

154,"Hi all, I need some advice from strangers.

Essentially, I'm a 34/M with a 9-5 job that pays my bills, not my mind, and a gf that I love, but also has mental health and past trauma. I've battled anxiety my whole life, and for the past 10 years or so I've been on lexapro 10mg, which definitely helps with my anxiety, but ... I feel, stuck.

I'm not sure I want to blame it on the lexapro, which I know can make people feel pretty stuck, but it's a whole bunch of things. There are so many projects I want to do, so many things I want to see, so much money I want to make (not to make me happier, just to pay off my bills, which I know I can do!) and so many people I want to connect with.

By saying stuck, I truly feel like I'm brain fogging my way around life. I have almost everything you could want on the outside, a house, a beautiful girlfriend, a job, but I can't put my clothes away after I wash them, I take hours to make dinner, I say I'm going to do something and never do it -- and it feels like everything is stacking up, and friends are rushing by me (not that i'm judging myself to them, they just don't seem stuck) while I'm doing the same thing day in and day out.

I have started to see a therapist to discuss this, and I've considered cutting down my daily sativa cannabis intake. I was a former tri-weekly workout/swim guy, but the projects I've started have taken away from that time, something I need to get back to.

I feel like my gf is constantly asking me to do something around the house, I say I will, then never do it. A project a friend and I have as a side hustle doesn't get paid attention to, and I get texts from him saying ""hey did xyz or get done?"" I feel like I'm letting those around me down, by being down.

Is this just regular old depression? Is this something else? How have you gotten out of these stuck ruts? To be honest, this rut has been years in the making. I make some progress (getting a new job/ moving in with my gf) but then I take a bunch of steps back, fantasizing about all the things I don't have and want, or where I should be in life.

It's exhausting and I want to get out. Any suggestions?",16Sep2019,2

   * Nothing helps me get the sneaking feeling of putting something off (even if it's for a few minutes).
   * The worst part about this is that I lost all feeling of caring enough a long time ago. I used to actively study for school, and I had a personal project that I was super passionate about. Since then, I can't seem to care enough about anything to actively pursue it.
   * I just wait until I force myself to do something right before it becomes a problem.
   * I can’t get into a relationship because I can’t bring myself to care enough to make the other person feel appreciated
* I can only find pleasure in video games and Youtube, which I know is very unhealthy.
* I passively avoid talking to new people (or sometimes even acquaintances) because I know I'll make the situation awkward.
* I feel sad a lot of the time I'm not engrossing myself in video games or drowning my sorrows in music.
* I feel as if I have some form of depression, but it's not serious enough to be considered 'depression'
* I'm pretty sure I have an inferiority complex
* I feel like I’m not special (I’m not), or that I’ll be nothing more than another face in the crowd; an average person with no personality or people to remember me (other than family)
* Whenever people see something that makes them go, ""Wow, nature is beautiful!"", I look at it and think, ""That's a cool-looking (tree/rock/whatever it is)""
* I am afraid that if I express myself to other people, I'll be shot down
* I am afraid to experience joy because I've only ever been shot down during the 'high'
* I am afraid that if I express my mental issues people will think I'm begging for attention or that I'm trying to be 'edgy'
* I attempt to hide my sadness behind a 'humorous' personality
* I feel like others hate me but don't say it out loud because they don't want to be 'rude'
* I feel like a constant burden whenever someone offers help
* I try to help others feel good because I have given up on my own happiness
* I feel like I'm a leech on society- consuming what others make/do but never contributing

I feel like I just act happy in front of everyone and everything is all jolly and well, but on the inside its just a massive vat of negativity, darkness and bad thoughts that shouldn't be going through people's heads. It's gotten to the point where I have lost sight on the light at the end of the tunnel and I don't really think about anything like where I am gonna be in the future because I just assume my future is going to be cut short at some point soon.

161,"17/M. First of all, I get it that my parents want the best for me, I just think they are doing it in a completely wrong way. Both my parents are teachers and they are not strict in a violent sense, they are just REALLY overprotective. For example, growing up, I would often BEG my parents to sign me into a sports club like soccer or martial arts but they never did because they thought these sports are too dirty, violent and dangerous. Also, whenever I finished my homework in primary school, my father would go through ALL the exercises to spell check, make sure I solved them right and make sure I study hard for the next day, this took away a huge amount of my free time, I have vivid memories of doing this while listening to children with less strict parents playing outside to the park next to my house, It was soul-crushing to say the least. All of this really crippled my social skills, I don't remember ever having a close friend, one that I would hang out with outside of school, I only remember bullies. Now that I'm in high-school my parents are stricter than ever, they either judge me for not studying hard enough or for not being social enough. They've even signed me up to private tutoring (Extra hours of school). Leaving me with a tiny amount of free time that I usually spend on the internet (That is before dad storms in and tells me to stop slacking otherwise he'll confiscate my laptop until summer). Normally I love learning, I binge watch crash course and khan academy all the time, but HOLY shit, my parents are making it one big chore. This kind of upbringing caused many problems for me, I'm so socially awkward to the point where I can't make eye contact, I let small things get to me and I immediately forget the names of my classmates that I spend years with.

163,"I'm 20 years old and before I type what I'm going to type - I just want to say that I see psychologists regularly and explain myself to them. I've seen good ones, and really good ones. They all tell me its anxiety, ocd, but not schizophrenia. My brother had a psychotic episode and ever since then I would obsess over if I was going crazy. Every thought I have in my head, I stay neutral and don't have any firm beliefs on anything or I think I'm delusional =/ 

The thing that scares me most is I overthink anything. If my friend asks me to go out that I haven't saw in a while I pay attention to how they're talking to me, my mind goes from ""what if I said something to their friend badly and they want to jump me"" to ""maybe they they want to meet me then kill me then themselves because they're insane"" yes I know these thoughts are absolutely retarded but they scare me to the point I just don't go out because of the ""what if"" its absolutely disgusting and I'm convinced its related to an upcoming psychosis. I left highschool after 3 years, have no friends. I only find enjoyment from sitting on my computer watching YouTube videos/livestreams or music. 

I seriously cannot go anywhere. I drove to asda's to get shopping at night and seen people there that were just standing. I just drove away as I couldn't bring myself to get out my car and walk past them because of the ""what if they start something or try to rob me"" when I get petrol I see someone standing next to me and think ""what if they just pour gas on me and set me alight"" it scares me and sends me into a panic attack while I feel crazy at the same time. People knock on my door for a delivery and my mind goes to ""what if its an acid attack or robbery"" this all revolves around paranoia.

166,"Hello all! I'm posting this here because it's relating to my mental health,  however it also could be apart of r/relationship_advice. I'd post there, but I've been told to just toughen up or quit being a wimp. So here is for better luck. I'll keep it short. 

I had a talk with my partner and was told that I'm controlling. I looked up what would be considered controlling and I noticed I've done a few things that can be considered controlling. I've been mentally and physically abused in the past from previous partners, family, and friends to the point where I've been diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety, and depression.

I've been trying to improve myself and get rid of these negative qualities and emotions from the past years. It's just difficult. I'm seeing a therapist, but it often takes time (weeks) before my next appointments. Does anyone have some suggestions/advice that I could try?",16Sep2019,1
167,"So a couple of days ago I decided to hit a few dabs with my buddies and ended up smoking a lot more than I had anticipated, probably 6-7 big rips. 

After 20 minutes  goes by I begin to have these thoughts,  we are literally just animals with a consciousness that gives us some sort of freedom but I feel trapped. Everything felt instinctual, what people were saying, their emotions, how they move etc. I just thought to myself if you really broke it down we are just trying to survive with no experience other than what our natural instincts evolved for us to thrive.

 I feel so alienated when I see how other people are able to easily find something to talk about and just talk for hours and hours. I feel so trapped in my own life and it's such a helpless feeling.

173,"I (22F) live in a major city with roommates after graduating from college, but am considering moving back to a small city in the Midwest for both mental health and financial reasons. I’ve been struggling with a lot of anxiety and loneliness, mainly following a breakup and graduating from school, and thinking that moving home could help.

However, I’m also concerned that I could hurt my mental health by making me feel isolated, cut off from my friends in the city, and too reliant on my parents.

Any thoughts are really appreciated.",16Sep2019,1
174,"Where do I start. I'll begin by saying I've been severely depressed for the past 5 years, and I have awful social anxiety. Needless to say, this makes daily life quite challenging and I've begun to hate having to interact with other people, or going anyplace where I can draw attention to myself. 

I recently finished my A-levels, getting much better grades than I expected as I spent a lot of time absent from sixth form (British high-school equivalent, I guess). My plan has always been to simply go to uni, and take each day as it goes from there. The only problem is that now that I'm less than a week from moving into student dorms, I've begun to experience immense dread over the idea of living in an environment where I'm constantly surrounded by thousands of other young people, having to share a kitchen and not knowing what to expect from freshers week (first thought conjures up images of getting mindlessly drunk). I'm beginning to think I simply won't be able to cope in this environment, and that maybe the university lifestyle won't be for me and I should cancel everything. You may be thinking ""why not at least give it a try? You never know what might happen"". I would do that, if it didn't risk financial complications relating to my loans in the event I go and hate it. The idea of this happening and potentially being 'trapped' terrifies me.

Now here's the other thing, I also despise the idea of staying at home. I won't go into this too much, but my home environment is also terrible for my mental health. Ironically, I've been very eager to move out, until the moment has actually arrived. Continuing to live here will only worsen my depression and level of social isolation (I have no friends in this town), and I think I quite literally could lose my mind. I've already been experiencing immense bouts of anger that I can predict but not control. 

It feels as though I have to choose between going crazy from social anxiety at uni or isolation at home. Both options just seem horrible and I don't know how I should proceed. I know I definitely need to seek help for my mental issues, and although the side-effects are off-putting, I want some medication that can calm me the hell down.

177,"When I was in high school, this guy, Matt, used me. I met him summer after his senior year was over. I hung out with one of his senior friends Peter. Peter invited me to a party with Tom. I had five shots of vodka. At the party, I didn't know anyone. They asked me to leave to have sex. I was dumb and said yes, because I was drunk. Matt and Peter had sex with me, I bled. I was a sophomore 16 at the time.



Afterward, they ignored me and talked badly about me calling me gross and a slut. They heard rumors about me, so they thought I wanted it. I kept hooking up with Matt because I felt so alone and disgusting maybe if he liked me nothing terrible happened. He left for the military. I have kept an on and off sexting relationship for six years.



From when I was 16-18, I would see him when he was on leave and hookup. He took photos of me two times. He keeps those sending them to me being like ”don't you miss this :)” He would only want to talk to me about sex or photos. He cheated on his girlfriend with me (I didn't know they were dating). He would have sex with me and ignore me.




I went on vacation once, and my phone broke. He sent me at least 30 messages and was mad I didn't respond. After three years knowing him, he told me he wanted me for sex and nothing more. That he felt no connection to me. It's been four years since all that, and I feel broken. . He still tries to contact me trying to cheat on his girlfriend with me or see me again. I try to ignore him then he'll bombard me with texts it works to face time me.



I moved away and didn't talk to anyone he knows. He still keeps photos of me and sends them to me, asking if I miss this. I feel so used and dirty. Something must be so wrong with me. I haven't seen him in person for four years. I blew up at him.



He was trying to bait me by apologizing then he would come on to me. He had a life in girlfriend at the time I blew up at him calling him a waste of space, rapist, douchebag, cockroach and a sociopath. I'm not proud because over the years I've never said anything that means to him. He acts like he has the moral high ground and I'm a bitch because he had never said anything so mean to me (even though he called me annoying when I was asking why I wasn't good enough when I found out he had a girlfriend and used me).



He also says he didn't rape me that we were all having fun and meant no harm. He says he didn't force or manipulate me(I did say yes right away), he was drunk too, and it's only a two year age difference.



Am I a mean person for sending all these mean messages? What's wrong with me? Why did he treat me this way? Was that sexual assault? tl;Dr: Guy, who used me for years, still tries contacting me, and I blew up at him.",16Sep2019,1
178,"Is it strange that I talk to myself out loud about my problems when no one is around? I don’t know if this is a sign of any underlying mental health issues, or if this is perfectly normal for one to do. I figured if anyone would know, or can relate, it would be this sub.",16Sep2019,2
179,"When I was 13 I desperately wanted to be homeschooled. I already preferred to be alone even though I had no problem in social situations, so I exaggerated this to the point of being completely socially isolated, thinking it would get me pulled out of school. I told a therapist I wanted to kill my teachers and intentionally made my body language awkward to convince them that I needed to be homeschooled. This led to a lot of unnecessary drama and in hindsight I wish I had just sucked it up and got on with school, it also led to an Aspergers diagnosis.

Since my parents and teachers at my new school believed it, I had to see a ton of psychologists and therapists in the last 3 years. Now, no matter how normal I act, they always find a way to twist what I do to confirm the Aspergers diagnosis. For example if I’m interested in anything, they’ll call it my ‘special interest’ and assume I’m a genius at it. If I say I do sports, they call it ‘stimming’ and a ‘coping mechanism’ and if I don’t do sport they assume I must be clumsy and have bad hand-eye coordination. If I cry it’s viewed as a ‘meltdown’ and if I don’t they say I lack empathy. Everyone treats me as if I have a disorder, even if I act just like everyone else. It’s checkmate. There is nothing I can do that won’t be labeled as a symptom of Aspergers.

All the psychologists I’ve seen seem to have a habit of labelling what’s pretty much normal human behaviour as a symptom of mental disorder. It’s causing problems I didn’t used to have, like I never used to think much about eye contact and body language but now It’s very conscious and mechanical as I’m so used to trying to prove that I’m normal, that I’ve forgotten how to even act normal anymore.

Does anyone have any experiences with this? How can I prove I’m normal without it being twisted into another excuse to put more labels on me? Is it even possible to get an Aspergers diagnosis revoked?",16Sep2019,1
180,"I know that you can be influenced from the people you surround yourself with, but this case seems more extreme. 

My friend tends to pick up interests, traits, quirks, and even problems of others and make them his own.  

There are smaller things like building his personality, language and humor solely off of the intent and people he knows,  then there’s more..

For example, I picked up photography as a hobby/side gig, he suddenly is highly interested in photography. Bought the same camera I have, and has even copied photos I’ve taken. I even started a photo series, and shortly after he stared a series with a very similar name. 

Another friend if his became a dance/fitness instructor, he suddenly found his way into doing the same thing. 

I recently changed my career path, and he suddenly wants to do exactly (literally step by step) what I’m doing.  

We’ve been friends for 6 years and as my style changes, he changes it similarly to mine. Literally dresses like I do. 

I became interested in horoscopes, spirituality, etc, he did the same. 

Also, this friend is of middle eastern culture, and his closest friend and myself are of Spanish and Caribbean decent. He’s become obsessed with our culture and pretends to know the language and all things about the culture. 

His roommate who is also a very close friend of his has lots of medical issues, and he’s convinced himself he also has these issues. To the point he went to the ER 8 times in a year and each visit they told him he’s fine. 

Most concerning is that I have diagnosed anxiety and talked to him a bit about it. Shortly after, he publicly announces his anxiety. He makes jokes and is the “poster boy” for it now on all of his social accounts. 



The odd part about this is everything he does that he picks up from others, he takes it to a whole new level. Like multiplies the obsession x10. I’m a way where he brags about loving it so much and knowing everything about it.

I know it seems childish to be concerned about, but it’s almost irritating to see someone who copies every little thing you do, especially as an adult.

182,"Cutting a long story short to focus on a specific part of it:
Around 4 years ago, I had to have a filling in a front tooth. Last night, the filling fell out. I was and still am really depressed about it. The actual tooth became really blackened, somehow, which I just found out, despite the filling being there. To make it worse, the bottom half of the tooth which didn't have a cavity and wasn't black fell off (since it wasn't strong enough anymore) and now I basically just have a black cavity where a tooth should be. And I kinda hate myself even more for it. Messages welcomed and wanted.

I have an appointment on Thursday, everything should be paid for on the NHS, which I'm very thankful for. I've only been taking care of my teeth since 18, and even from then it's been very on/off. About 1.5-2 years consistently atm. I'm now 23. I severely neglected them from around 11. I didn't think I'd need them. I didn't plan on making it to 20, forget beyond.

I'm hoping this time around the filling or more likely a 1-tooth denture will last. I also need multiple other fillings, too. I really just want to not be alive to deal with this. I hate my teeth. I hate what depression has caused.",16Sep2019,1

186,"I have created a second account for this, and probably some other posts, because my parents have given me reason to believe that they have a less-than-stellar, perhaps firmly ingrained conception of certain disabilities, which includes the one I will be discussing in this post, they both use this site, and I still live with them. Silly me for having my other username so easily identify me.

So my diagnostic journey and interaction with the mental health system has been pretty wonky and complicated. I have seen more people than I can count on my fingers and toes, which have included therapists, psychiatrists, and those providing assessment. I currently see a therapist and have seen him for about a year. 

Today, I had my second visit with my current psychiatrist for medication management and he flat-out refused to continue prescribing me medication. He said that after getting an idea of my issues and learning about my history, he thinks that I am a mentally healthy autistic person. My therapist recently told me that he shares the same opinion and even informed me that he changed the code used for insurance purposes to reflect this.

So basically I am wondering if this all counts as a diagnosis for this condition, or if I will discover all of this insufficient for any future documentation, should I need it for graduate school, or the workplace for whatever reason. After spending a long time with my therapist helping me discover a lot of my behavior patterns, I strongly lean towards agreeing with these opinions, but also don’t want to come across as one of those annoying self-diagnosers who shove their agenda down people’s throats, and I want to do things the right way. I have read that therapists and psychiatrists are certainly allowed to diagnose people with mental conditions, but I have also gained the impression that there is a very specific assessment protocol and type of person who designates people as having ASD and usually involves a neuropsychologist. 

The neuropsychologist I went to four years ago was against the idea from the moment she met me, since “I would have known before I started school” and “I seemed too independent”, but she ended up diagnosing Unspecified Neurodevelopmental Disorder and OCD amongst some questionable non-DSM labels (CAPD, EFD, NVLD), while also finding it necessary to spend part of the report describing how certain questionnaires filled out by me and my parents seemed to indicate unusual sensitivity to my surroundings, without tying it to any of the conditions she put on the report. My psychiatrist appears to think that this was all probably a roundabout way to describe something which could have been a lot simpler.

I am dead tired of hopping around to different professionals, some of whom I have stumped completely, and have been doing so since the age of 10. I found the assessment process time-consuming and tiring, and it put my family into debt, so I hope I wouldn’t have to do it all over again, and it would be a shame to feel like I am finally figuring myself out after years of confusion, but have yet more hoops to jump through. But would I have to do another one of these assessments? Do any of you have experiences using the opinions of different types of professionals for documentation purposes and did some with certain credentials lead to more denial?",16Sep2019,3
187,"Hi. I want to be screened for autism but am afraid it will look like I am seeking an excuse for being a ""failure"" or ""incapable"".

I'm a 20 y/o female. Was diagnosed with ADHD at 5 and have been heavily medicated for it since 2nd grade. I have always joked about possibly having autism and that my family just never told me because I wouldn't understand. I even suspect my highly critical parents either avoid a screening or hide my diagnoses from me because they believe I can do life if I work hard enough. I am currently on yet another journey to finding why I am the way I am and why doing normal things in life is so much more difficult for me than what I see with others.  I struggled through school but mainly with simple conduct rather than grades. I was an A-B average student when I had my medications. I have heard that even though ADHD and Autism symptoms overlap that some people can even have both. I am diagnosed with Social Anxiety, General Anxiety, Clinical Depression, and that one anxiety-induced skin picking thingy that I never cared to memorize the name of. 

So, anyways, to support my concerns:

Any loud noise such as poles clanking to the floor to motorcycles revving make me tense up and I feel the need to hide. I have always struggled with memorizing which side of my body is right and which side is left as well as the difference between b and d. I still can never get them right to this day. Microfiber cloths and other similar fabrics feel like they catch on to the microscopic features of my skin and just thinking about them makes me cringe. I can socialize and am more empathetic than the average person and am very emotionally driven as some would call Impulsive. Socialization takes a lot of effort such as continuing a conversation and making eye contact and nothing spontaneously spoken is without stuttering or mispronunciation. I tap patterns of phrases with my fingers over and over again. If I do not have access to any possible thing I may end up needing, I panic and therefore always stay home, in my bed. I can't think of any autism spectrum related symptoms that I can relate to but also I don't know if my ""symptoms"" are too minor as some doctors would blow it off and say ""that's pretty normal"".  Like if I am asked ""Do you tend to not express your emotions in your tone when speaking to others?"" I start to think, ""Isn't that too specific? Well, I am often accused of being upset or bored when I am actually the contrary. Some kid in 9th grade asked me why I speak in monotone and it crushes me to this day. I don't know exactly what this question is asking."" 

I cannot assess myself but when asked about myself I can only go off of what others have said about me. My dad always scolds me for being a know-it-all but I can't help but to know excessive and useless facts about an array of topics. My mom has always told me how wise I am from a young age. 

I know I am not happy with where I am in life and I have countless plans of how I will work towards making a living but everything seeks way too risky so I avoid growth. My mood changes are very circumstantial and rarely do I ever have a say in what emotions I feel. I am often never happy but laughter is the most convenient relief and so I behave like a character around others because I don't know who I am supposed to be.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is long but I would like to hear from people with High Functioning Autism or anyone who knows what makes a person autistic at any level of the spectrum. Ask me more questions about certain situations and tell me whether or not in your opinion should I seek further in a diagnosis or just that I am crazy but only for thinking that there is something more wrong with me.",16Sep2019,3

It wasn't a surprise since I've been feeling a lot better, but to see those results going down to practically 0 brought the biggest smile to my face in a very long time, I cried out of happiness. I know I still have some work to do, but I'm just genuinely happy that I fought depression and won!

If you're out there battling with what I did, I just want to tell you that you're stronger and braver than you think, winning wars inside our head is probably one of the hardest things to do, but the fact that you get up every day, that you take those baby steps towards a better situation makes you great for it. For me what it worked was to let go of the anxiety that the tomorrow would bring, and let go of the sadness that the past caused, what I had at some point will make me stronger today, and what I am right now will impact tomorrow. So I decide to be a better me today so I can give the very best tomorrow. Much love to everyone out there.",16Sep2019,4

My daughter is the light of my life and I love her to death. When she is good, she's so good and wonderful to be around. But when she's rotten, she's so rotten that I want her gone. I know it's terrible to feel that way but my life is starting to be ruined.

We have had ongoing behavior issues for quite some time. Things are really at a head right now and I can't live this way anymore. She's in first grade. She is getting in trouble/notes sent home daily. She was asked to leave a daycare a couple years ago. She is careless, reckless, has fits of rage, doesn't listen, talks about disgusting things all day everyday and so on. I started looking at ADHD. I talked to her pediatrician and got a psych referral. We opted to try therapy first but are getting nowhere with it.

We have exhausted all options at this point. I don't want to do this to her, but I have enough on my plate as it is. I struggle with my own mental illness (bipolar, anxiety, OCD, misophonia) and I opt to be non medicated due to increased suicide risk and tremors. I did therapy myself for several years and have learned what my triggers are and am overall in a good place in life - except my kid. I have my dream job, which I almost lost because of her. I had to leave work daily at one point because she was disrupting the daycare and they asked her to leave. Then they kicked her out.

I have tried rewards, taking away stuff, bargaining, incentives, throwing stuff away, being nicer, being meaner, counselling together. I'm REALLY trying. We are getting nowhere. I planned a trip for next month for fall break, which was contingent on good behavior, and it looks like we will be cancelling it now. I'm at a loss. I don't know what to do anymore. Our counsellor says she has all the classic signs of ADHD.

So, we're at this stage. I'd like to hear some stories about before and after taking medication for ADHD. If you could tell me your child's age and what medication was recommended, I'd appreciate it. I'm interested in Concerta for her after researching.
