0,"I've been going to therapy sense between January or February 2010 and when I have a consistent therapy sessions, I feel like I can cope better with stressors. But I hadn't gone to one on one therapy for a couple years after the past therapy office never got back to me. So I decided to go back to the clinic I started out in. Everything was going great; I love my med doctor and my therapist. My problem is the therapist after telling me to schedule 3 appointments ahead, cancelled 2 weeks in a row. I have 1 more appointment that was scheduled left. It'll completely discourage me if she cancells the remaining one as well. When I want to get help for whatever it is, I want the help now. Once I realized after all these years I was abused in 2010, I wanted the proper help. And now that I made that aspect more of a concern, I haven't been seen sense. I was finally being listened to and thought I was finally getting the help I needed, but instead got played into thinking it was that easy again. This still shouldn't be going on 9 years after the abuse happened, but it sadly is. Emotional abuse is sadly the most hidden form of abuse, and it's eatting at my mental health little by little each passing day. I was thrown on antidepressants the moment the abuse started taking a toll on me, pushing aside the thought I was actually being abused. I was able to cope with my grandmother's passing and my parents divorce, but the abuse is what impacted me. The day I moved into my dad's house, I broke down. I knew nothing good was coming out of that situation, and I was fucking right.",18Jul2019,1
1,"I’m 18 (m)
Essentially I have lost everyone close to me in life and I feel like this is one place that someone will listen to me. 
I’ve had issues with depression, self harming and suicidal thoughts in the past and I eventually overcame them, but in the last few months everything has started to crumble again. My family is broken from my parents separating and bills piling up, my family use me as a crutch and vent to me which stresses me out so much I’m losing sleep over it.
As well as family issues my social life is pretty much non existent at the moment: my best friend has been distant and saying things about me behind my back to people, and my other best friend (girl) thinks that I said awful things about to her as a result of people spreading rumours and I’ve pretty much lost her too. My house feels like a prison to me but yet I never leave it, only to drink and get food and go to the gym. I have all but one friend left and although I like her so much as more than friends I can’t bring myself to tell her because I fear another rejection so much. 
I self harmed for the first time in 11 months late  on Monday night and I’m scared I’ll make a habit out of it again. Today I felt like I’d be better off dead but I don’t have the balls to act on it because it would affect my family. 
If anyone even got down this far thank you so much, but I just want to know will it get better or not. I feel so empty and alone even when I’m surrounded by people. I want everything to go away and I want to be happy so so badly.",18Jul2019,1

I believe I’m on the edge of losing my mind honestly,I’m a massive moron so I can’t even begin to understand the problems my overly ambitious noggin’ keeps concocting. How do i shut my brain up is my first question,secondly is it normal for a 17 year old to begin to loose or partially forget pretty crucial parts of life? I’m talking my old house has completely left my mind,and I’ve been gone a month. I struggle with names,days, forgot how to tie my shoes the other day,guess my brain keeps tripping me up (ba dum tiss) and worst of all,I’m getting a little bit unhinged,and more-so than usual. As in, my mind is loose enough that my inhibitions and the line between right and wrong is virtually none existent. Nothing is funny but i laugh at everything (or maybe the other way around) and I just feel like I’m adrift I guess,on top of all the usual stuff. Recently left my mentally and emotionally abusive and neglectful household with my mother to live with my Father who beat me up once but seems okay now,even though i was raised on horror stories about how Evil he is. P.S the reason i left is because i was turfed out after committing a crime after trying to raise the funds to get away from home. Now facing likely Prison time. I feel absolutely nothing about the fact I could go to jail,just total boredom. Would be kinda cool to go to prison i guess ? I dunno.

I'm 25. My dad passed away days before his 58th. He was just re-furnishing his apartment, enjoying life and taking me shopping like he always wanted too. He was my best friend and I relied on him for mental support and understanding. (As an adult I do know how to take care of that myself, he was my confidont, though.) Ugh.

I have contacted local grief councelling places to try and cope. It's still just really hard and really shitty. I just miss him so much. I guess I just had to vent.

I have been on the road only a few times and they were only for about 30 seconds each time. Most of them ended with me having a panic attack and pulling over.
I don't have a good home life and I desperately need the freedom of being able to drive, but I can't bring myself to properly practice because of my anxiety. I also feel guilty when I have to ask my mom to take me out to practice driving, so that is another deterrent for me.

i've posted about this a couple months ago and a couple people were very helpful.  im still not really sure how i feel about this whole situation and im very embarrassed especially as a man with how i acted.  i wanna be very very very clear that i wasnt raped, he never physically touched me.  

In college our dorm was kind of a party hot spot, i dormed with 2 dealers and one was a huge coke head so we had these pretty fun parties a few times a week, usually friday, saturday, tuesday, sometimes thursday and there were always a lot of people over and everyone knew eachother. I've never really had any friends, im a pretty normal guy but I get very overwhelmed and paranoid and break off relationships very early.  I've gone over a year without spending time with a single person besides work.  So when it was time to go to college i was very excited to start over and try to behave like a normal person. 

 It went fairly well for most of the year but issues started rising near the end.  This guy would sleep on my floor 2-3 times a week because he'd always come party and lived too far to drive.  I didnt have any issue with this because I knew him all year and he was always really nice and cool with me, we actually hung out a lot.  One night with about a month left in the semester, i believe he thought I was sleeping.  He kept flashing a light on my body while i was sleeping (i was beyond high and drunk) and i believe he masturbated to my body, i know damn well what it sounds like.  it was very late at night and the first time I thought I was going to be raped and kind of froze up.  i sat there the whole time trying to think of a way to attack him if he made any physical move.  He did it for around 15min then walked to the bathroom so im assuming he finished (gross).  After this he started doing it very often.  Almost every time he came over, sometimes he'd get up and flash the light and sometimes he'd just do it in bed.  I had an issue with drugs and alcohol and was high and drunk all day, passing myself out every night and i kinda fell into a period of deppression.  

I hated he did it.  hated it hated it hated it.  it made me sick.  i got regular panic attacks after that and spent most nights in the bathroom till 3am.  i always told people i felt sick and needed to puke (bunch of dorm party bros puking was cool at the end of the night).  I wanted him to stop I really did it made me very uncomfortable but I didnt say anything ever.  I was so afraid to loose the only friends I had in years.  I'd have to explain to all my friends why this guy couldnt come around anymore and what he was doing and i just couldnt.  So i just let this guy jerk off to my body multiple times a week for the better part of a month.  I always just pretended to sleep or went to the bathroom to ""puke"" aka have another panic attack.  i let this guy walk completely all over me and i never said a word.

I kind of obsessed over it for a while after school and what I should have done different, but after some time I wasnt thinking much about it anymore.  I just noticed he sent me a message on snap today and im kind of afraid to open it.  because other than all this he was very nice, would frequently help me with money (my parents wouldnt send me money and i was pawning off all my stuff to feed my addiction, stealing all my food, i went for multiple days without eating a few times).  he was going into a medical field which is kinda scary but other than this he didnt do anything else fucked up.  Is it maybe possible he didnt realize he made me feel this way and thought it was okay.  I just feel like since I didnt say anything I kind of gave permission.  Because I could have said no at any time, I could have beat his ass at any time, but I always pretended to sleep. I let my fears of losing my friends take over and thought I should just put up with it till hes gone in a month.  I was more worried my roomates (seperate rooms, shared kitchen, etc) would hear him that anything else.  Maybe he thought it was normal behavior? Idk what some cultures are like or how he was raised but he was.  Im really just not sure how I should feel, or why he messaged me and im kind of afraid to open it.",18Jul2019,1
11,"I don't know where else to post this or really what to do so but i just need to post how i feel, maybe this will help me..

I am 21 with no job or license and i hate everything about myself. i think i am the ugliest person everywhere i go, i constantly put myself down and wonder what it would be like if I was gone, but I also feel I would never off myself because i would feel terrible doing that to my friends and family. I don't feel comfortable in my own skin I never have I don't even like looking at myself in a mirror really. I hate talking to people because of how messed up my teeth are. 

&amp;#x200B;

My life feels like so pointless and dragged out and I feel like i'm on auto pilot. I just do it. I was never like this up until about 2 years ago but it has gotten progressively worse. I lie to my friends so I can stay home a lot more than I ever did. When someone cancels plans I feel like a weight is lifted. In higschool I was ALWAYS away from home, out with my friends partying and doing all the normal teenager stuff but now it's the opposite. I feel like I can't talk to anybody about this because everyone is so judgmental now a days and no one will understand. I want a normal life like everyone else but I feel so un- normal. That's not even a word but yeah. I feel like when I go out with people they look down on me because i'm a loser. I had dreams of doing big things when I was young and now it's just nothing, back then I would look at my future and see myself doing all these big things and I had ""visions"" of how i wanted it to be but now I look into the future and see nothing but bleakness. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would love nothing more than to have a loving gf, a job, and just being happy about myself and how I look. I wish I was as motivated as some of the people that I know but it's like I can't. I want to have the motivation to go out and get a job and do all these things but it's like... I can't.. I know i sound crazy and stupid and maybe I am but it just feels like a mental block that I can't get past. I have never talked to anyone about this or seen a doctor/psychiatrist/therapist who ever deals with this stuff and even if I wanted to I couldn't because I have no money. I feel so alone every single day of my life but I know no one will ever want me in this state I am in. I haven't felt real happiness in a long time, that only happens when i'm drunk. My biggest fear in life is not being to live the life I want to live and unfortunately I am going down that path of not living it and I don't want it to happen but I feel like I will end up at the end of the road for my life.",18Jul2019,2

until now, i’ve never legitimately searched methods of ending my life. i never thought i was brave enough to do it. but something snapped and everything feels impossible. i feel so close to just doing it and getting it over with.
i know it’s all bullshit. i know it’ll get better. i know to hang in there, i’ve already come this far, people will miss me, all that stuff. 

but god if it doesn’t fucking suck, constantly fighting with my own mind that is trying to convince me to end it.
and tonight i’m closer than i’ve ever been. i genuinely don’t want to keep living. i’m only afraid that i’ll fuck it up somehow and end up super sick or like a vegetable, and then i’ll be even worse off than i am now.

15,"I have struggled with anxiety and depression and possibly PTSD(Its something I still need to discuss with my doctor) for about 13 years. I would repeat this cycle of feeling ok, not doing anything about it and when I was in a bad time, I never knew where to go, but I knew I needed help, I would check myself into inpatient facilities. I never considered myself suicidal however I would have thoughts, and as soon as I would open up I felt like I was being punished. I felt like all my rights were taken away and communication was all but nonexistent. Ive been in 4 different facilities, three different states. Only once was I given a diagnosis, they said I was bipolar, I couldn't.. I didn't believe it. Ive tried multiple medications and have had serious bad reactions, from seizures to mood swings so so bad within minutes, one of my visits was due to meds making me lashout at people and had the police called to my house and talked into going in again. 

I lost trust in the system, I lost trust in my government, I lost trust in people. This lead to me developing Nosocomephobia(fear of hospitals). So I put my care off even more, isolated myself and started self medicating with weed and xanax. This only covered my issues and let them silently ferment within my mind. The doctors would talk to me for a few minutes, write a script for a random ssri and move on. I would literally act, make up some story about how much my perspective on life has changed, and they fell for it, I just needed out. I need my life, my job, my home. I felt that I was invisble, that i wasnt human. I felt like I wasnt allowed to have feelings, that everything I did or thought was wrong. I felt like a cow in an assembly line with a tag in my ear. This pissed me off, and made me hate the world even more. 

A few months ago, I started having heart palpitations and pain in my chest that wouldn't go away. It was a slap in the face of reality and that I cant do this alone, that the constant anxiety was taking a serious toll on me physically. I was terrified, mad at the world and heartbroken. Worst of all, I was completley alone. I still dont know why I kept trying, i kept calling crisis lines, and STILL felt like I wasnt being heard. I made it up in my mind that not only do I need genuine help and support, but I deserve it. I broke down at work, crying with my supervisor that i know i need to do SOMETHING and that i was terrified, and didnt know what was going to happen. So I go to the ER. Ask for patient advocate before i went into the room and never saw one, called admin while i was in the room and never saw someone, went to the security desk and asked to see an advocate, still never did.  They run tests while i wait in wonder, not being told whats happening my anxiety only escalating,doctor  says ""youre all good"" and at that point I knew I wasnt ""all good"" and walked out of the er with an iv still in my arm. I know this isnt completley rational behavior but i wasnt really in a rational state. And i was pissed. I went home defeated, exhausted. Felt like all was left to do was give up and let it keep slowly killing me. 

The next day at work I felt that I'm not accepting defeat, im not going to let the incompetence of the system ruin me, not like this. I called again, after a very agry vent, decided to take the rest of the day off and was determined to find SOMEONE sincere, SOMEONE that saw me as a human being. A social worker called me on my way home, started balling my eyes out and had to pull over, calmed myself enough so that she could understand me. I explained to her that I needed someone to be there for me, i needed someone to care and not just ask if im suicidal and throw meds at me. She found a nurse at a facility about an hour away. Gave me a name, and explained to her my situation so I didnt have to go through it all again. 

This person called ME! Said she can talk to me to keep me calm while I drive there. She instantly made the connection of my existential perspective, no doctor, psychologist or therapist has ever said anything like that. I was shocked.. Shes listening to me. She even met me in the lobby, so I didnt have to worry about finding where to go. She walked me through the process of registering and making appointments. I did it all, but she was by my side, every step of the way. And she went in the system on the computer, found a councelor that had an open spot last minute so I could talk that day. I still had my problems, I didnt feel better physically, but i had hope. There was finally light at the end of this very very long tunnel. 

Today I was feeling so exhausted I couldn't focus, couldnt shake the anxiety because my heart was a constant reminder. I called her and she suggested I go in again and talk with a doctor. They did the tests, and these people LOOKED at me, in the eye. They got me water, and tissues. They talked to me as if I was one of their friends visiting them at work, they comforted me. They cared. The doctor came in and didnt say ""youre prefectly fine"". He said ""youre having premature ventricular contractions"" (arrhythmia). He said ""your heart seems perfectly healthy, youre tests look normal and considering your age/weight its nothing to be too converned about and that the main cause is stress"" he told me what was happening, and explained why, and maybe cut down on caffeine. He didnt say theres nothing wrong when clearly i feel like im dying. They gave me avenues to get out and socialize, places to find events related to my interests and generally treated me like I mattered. I now have appointments with a general doc and therapist. I have a plan. Im going in the right direction.. After over a decade of dealing with this, struggling. 

I almost deleted this post because of my self criticism, so if you read all this thank you. Thank you for listening. I know I havent always made the best decisions, I know i didnt always act appropriately and I know i can me stubborn. But I didnt give up, I held on. I may not have always been the strongest but I didnt let go. I convinced myself that I deserve to have a fulfilling life. I just had to find the right person. 

If you are struggling, if you feel like giving up or that you cant keep on, even if you dont believe me, you can do this. I was 110% convinced that the world is bullshit and that no one cares.. I was wrong. Maybe not everyone will care the way you want them to, but someone will, and they will change your life. People do care. 

Please keep it up, keep trying, keep calling. Do it because you deserve it, do it because people in your life deserve you. Im not a writer, im not an english teacher, im not perfect, im a human being and so are you and thats ok. All we need is to be there for eachother.",18Jul2019,2
16,"About 5 1/2 years ago, I was diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. I have been taking sertraline (Zoloft) every since.   
The medication helped and coupled with therapy, I got everything under control. However recently, I have had some abnormal struggles that have caused me some extra stress (some close family friends being diagnosed with terminal illnesses). Then, for the first time in my life, I experienced suicidal thoughts. Now I should preface this with the fact that I would never act on these actions. The thoughts were just more like, ""What if I did."" It was just unnerving to have these thoughts because I had never experienced them before and it is not a pleasant thought to think about.

Now I think that I know why these thoughts had come out of nowhere:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I had missed some of my sertraline doses in June (like 3 doses in a week). I figured that maybe it took a couple of weeks for my body to notice that there was an interruption in the dosages and that as I came back on it, I started to encounter some typical side effects, including suicidal thoughts.
2. I went to the doctor to get a prescription filled, and he was asking me some questions, and one of them was if I had ever had suicidal thoughts. I said no, and then that night, had those thoughts. Maybe it was the OCD that had me focusing on it.
3. All of the extra stress from family friends dealing with severe illness may have caused them.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have booked an appointment with my therapist, who I haven't seen in a year. I booked it mainly to talk to her about this. Now my main concern about telling her is that I go back to university in 3 weeks for 2 weeks of training before the academic year starts. I am really looking forward to this job, and am afraid that if I tell someone, they will blow it out of proportion and I will not be able to back to school in the fall. I haven't even told my parents yet, because I don't want to burden them with this.

&amp;#x200B;

But I have also taken steps myself. I realize how blessed I am to live the life that I do, with great family, friends, and privileges. I did my best to block those awful thoughts out of my head, and replace them with all of the blessings in my life. I just needed to vent to someone.",18Jul2019,1
17,"So I will start of talking about the things I like.

I like the first few seasons of game of thrones (later seasons not so much)

I like the original Matrix 1 (2 and 3 not so much)

I like the original Ghost In The Shell movie from 1995 (later movies and series not so much)

I like the expanse series on Amazon, as well as the audio books.

I enjoyed the shadows of mordor game and also horizon zero dawn on PS4.

Occasionally I will find a new science or tech article on sites like reddit, slashdot etc that interests me.

I like walking in nature, and think nature is always beautiful and amazing.

I love to fry tofu in olive oil and eat it with avocado and fresh cracked pepper.

I enjoy sex if other person and I have sexual compatibility, (if we don't not so much).

I love spending time with my cat and dog both.

That was everything I can think of that makes life bearable.

I wake up, and go to work and come home to do some chores, and brush my teeth and sleep and repeat the process.

My two days off there is nothing I want to do.

Interacting with people is painful, they feel completely fake to me.

There is never anything on television that doesn't seem absolutely insane.

When I watch TV this is how it feels to me:

I can't find any music that doesn't sound like nails on a chalkboard either, it all sounds like Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up stuck on repeat.

The internet as well seems to be overflowing with nothing but insanity and rarely can I find anything interesting to read.

Everything seems so insane and so out of control and so stupid.

It's like everything on television is 24x7 barney the purple dinosaur, music is terrible, culture is terrible, people are stupid and insane and obnoxious.

I do my best to smile and keep calm and carry on, but it feels like I do not belong in this culture and with these people.

It seems surreal to me.

I feel so out of place, and everything feels so absurd.

18,"Hi. I don't know what exactly this post is for, I just need to get everything out. I don't know if I have a mental disorder or not. Maybe it's just effects of being a teenager, or maybe I do have some kind of mental illness but that mental illness is just telling me I'm just a normal teenager when really I might actually need help. I don't know. I wake up somedays and I just feel drained. Like I have no energy. Also, I will just be doing something, talking to my friends or some shit, and then I'll just start thinking some random thought, like , ""you're worthless"" and such. It's like this uncontrollable thought, I can't get it out of my head. And then, once I think the thought, it spirals into even more thoughts and then I'm sad and I'll just start crying. And I'm always, always worrying. About such little things. Like, I'll check my homework like 20 times before I actually turn it in, or I'll keep checking to make sure I locked the door even though i know I did. And I worry about peoples opinions so much. Especially my parents, since I can never seem to be good enought for them. My grades used to be really bad, but i got them up to all A's and 2 89%'s, and they still said I didn't do good enough and that I was an embarrasment. That really doesn't help the uncontrollable thoughts and my self esteem. I used to self harm, but I've been doing better at keeping from doing that.

20,"(22F) Hi all, I'm sorry, I'm incredibly new to this sub but I need help. I've admitted to myself that I need help before but I'm afraid and I'm really just looking for words of encouragement or advice on how to go about this.

I live in the states and counseling in my area is definitely available, or at least a quick Google search says it is. Last time I got the nerve up to call, the receptionist told me I had the wrong office and I quickly gave up. 

I have no official diagnosis, probably apparent since I'm seeking help getting into therapy, but I'm fairly confident that I have anxiety, depression, and some type of social disorder. Anxiety and depression are both present in my mother but no one has ever been diagnosed with any social disorders. There are a lot of things I want to talk about and work through. I feel like some things that happened earlier in my life have had massive effects on me that I never noticed. 

I really don't want to go into detail because I start regretting even wanting to post this. I feel like my problems are so petty compared to everyone else's and I don't know if that's true or just a symptom of whatever is going on in my head. Last time I decided I needed help (months ago), I was hoping to just be given some meds that would help my situation but that's not what I want any more. I want to actually have someone to talk to and help me work on my problems, not just whisk them away with medications. 

I've recently been thinking about killing myself. This has been a recurring thought for the past ten years but it's coming up more and more. I tried a few weeks ago but my partner physically stopped me and removed my method before I had the chance (I'm guessing methods of suicide are prohibited here so I'm being vague, my apologies if I'm doing this wrong). I really don't want to be committed for my attempt or thoughts, it really scares me. I just need help and really want it quick, I don't know how much longer I can continue living and feeling like this.

If anyone has any knowledge of insurance, I have a PPO which I've always been lead to believe that this means I don't need a referral. When I went to a specialist for my diabetes, I didn't need a referral. Or really any other specialist for that matter. Does this change how fast I can get in? Can I expect to get an appointment somewhat quickly? Do you think they'll cooperate with my work schedule?

I'm really afraid but I know I need to get help.",18Jul2019,2

22,"This is a long story. I need to talk about it with someone or I’ll crazy. Lots of background history before I get to the point. Sorry ahead of time if it’s not clear, I can’t think too much about it. Just for quick info, I’m from USA and I’m aware of my easy access for mental health support. 

A few years ago I was diagnosed with clinical depression and went on medication when I was a freshman in college. I came from a Chinese family so we don’t talk about mental health at all. I went to seek mental health support without letting my parent know. I was pretty Suicidal so I knew I needed help. I was constantly crying and easily triggered. 

A while after that, I went cold turkey on my medication because I didn’t like how it made me feel. I wasn’t feeling any emotions at all. I wasn’t happy nor was I sad. I didn’t know how to interact with people without feeling fake because I felt uninterested in what’s going on around me. After a while of self love, I decided I wanted to feel emotions again, even if I was going to feel sad. My health insurance changed too so it was going to be expensive to see the doctor and psychologist again. 

I hate being around my dad, so much that I’ve arranged my work schedule to not be home when he’s awake since he sleeps around 9pm and work can go into 10pm. I told myself to never be with someone who is like my dad. He’s the typical man who comes home and expects the wife to make dinner while he sits on the couch to watch TV. His home remodeling project was half-ass and it looks horrible. He’s too lazy to fix anything so it falls onto me and my siblings. 

I met B online through gaming so it became a long distance relationship. His family owns a construction company so he can do house projects proficiently and he can also do housework. Basically ticked everything off my short checklist. The only thing was, he wasn’t the emotional type. Anytime we had a problem, he would walk away while I want to talk and solve it. In the beginning he was supportive of me when I was depressed and cried, but at some point he just can’t deal with it anymore and taught me what he call “tough love” and to grow a thicker skin so whatever my dad say won’t hurt me. He start to text less and then told me he no longer loves me and starts seeing someone new. That was July of 2018. 

It created a trauma/baggage for me. I hate the sound of dial tones and being left on read because of him. I feel worthless so I had to find support from others around me. 

I managed to pick myself up and felt like maybe I was ready for a new relationship last month. I hit it off well with C on a dating app. I became attached. Big mistake. I couldn’t help it. On his profile, he said if there was any problems, communicate it with him. That was something B wasn’t. Then I learn that C was also able to do housework and he’s pretty handy himself. Ticked off all the boxes again. I don’t know what was going through my mind. I was just happy to find someone that I could love and be around again. 

Except. He wasn’t texting me as often as he did before we met in person. It gave me anxiety because I had to rethink everything i said. Did I scare him away? Was I too much? I remember what he said about communicating when there’s issue so I told him my past and why I’m this way. Cool he understands. Except a few days later he called and told me he wasn’t ready for a relationship. He tends to ghost everyone when he has emotional issues and he don’t think he can be in a relationship like that. That happened this month, July 2019. (Are you seeing a pattern? Cause I do. I’m going to start hating the month of July now.) 

Some reason I felt like my world was crashing down around me. I was so depressed. I wasn’t worth loving again. All my hard work for self love went down the drain. I felt like a zombie because everything that could go wrong, went wrong. My work life was horrible, family isn’t the best, and my personal life went to hell. I didn’t have anything good going on for me because I felt stuck. 

Then last Tuesday I decided, let see if I could kill myself. If I don’t die, then it wasn’t meant to happen and it’s a sign that I should just push through. Swallow a handful of pills and became very sick. Before that pain happen, my mind felt clear again. A short moment of clarity from the overwhelming feeling of sadness. My body then went into detox mode and made me vomit. I went into the ER, they did an ekg and sent me home. I slept a little under 2 hours and it happens again. I was vomiting from 2am-8am. I lost 10lb from vomiting and it hurts all over. I wasn’t able to drink water without it coming back up again. You know how there’s a story about how people who jump off bridges regret it the moment their feet left the ground? Yeah that’s how I felt. I was in so much pain. 

I went to urgent care as soon as I could and they said my GI Tract probably has issues since that’s where I feel the most pain in. Long story short, it took a few days before my body felt okay again. 

It has officially been 1 week since that adventure. My mental state of mind is starting to become “normal” again. Similar to how I felt before I met C. I just want to be the me that never met him. Because now I know I can’t be in any romantic relationship. No matter how happy I was in the moment, I just can’t do it all over again for that brief moment of happiness. If I were to try again, it’ll be a very toxic relationship for both parties involved because it’ll literally drive me crazy if it happens again. I felt so overwhelm by how sad I felt and how lonely I was and I don’t want to revisit that again. 

Just now I made the decision to delete C’s contacts and cut off any form of communication, just like I did with B. When I did that, I felt a burning sensation in my throat and feeling of sadness again so I had to write this out before I become overwhelm by it again. I know my triggers, but I just gotta add another to the list. I feel sad and hopeless, I suddenly feel the pains in my side again from that time. I hate how my body remembers the pain and wants to remind me how much it hurts. 

A way for me to get over him, or at least try to so I don’t think about him at night, is to think of all the bad things I didn’t like about him. Told myself, he doesn’t approve of a genre of music I like, I would be the one driving to him since he’s car-less and still a college student (we’re the same age, he took a gap year), lack experience in bed so it wasn’t very enjoyable, he wore a graphic T-shirt on our first date when I did a few outfit changes before I settled on one I liked, and etc. I convince myself that in the long run, I’ll be unhappy and lonely since there was also red flags going on that I’ve ignored because I wanted to be in love. 

At least for now, my mind is clear and my sanity is here. It’s nice having it since this time last week, I was in a lot of physical and emotional pain. I think I was also as much of a bad experience for him as he was for me. I know C uses Reddit but we don’t know each other’s account, so if this sounds like a familiar story, I’ll like to apologize for my craze self. 

I’m looking to switch to a different insurance that covers more so hopefully I’ll be able to seek professional mental health support again. I think I need to talk to a psychologist to find myself some more. 

TL;DR : I thought I was ready to attempt a relationship, but I wasn’t. I felt all the negative emotions too deeply and tried to kill myself but failed. I saw myself going crazy and had to put a stop to it before I lose myself again. 

Thank you for reading this long story. I felt a rollercoaster of emotions just writing it out. I literally tear up at some part and then it went away as I moved onto another part.",18Jul2019,2

Anyways, I lie to myself and to others about how bad my mental health is. I think I feel like if my mental health is bad I'll be more popular/gain attention for myself, any shortcomings can just be put down to bad mental health. How do I stop doing this?

25,"I have very bad paranoia, and I always think that people are trying to steal my identity. My friends steal my hobbies and even my mental issues and try to be exactly like me, and that leads me to think that everyone does it, so it's hard to talk to people. Well, I've only told one person about what they do and how I feel, my younger brother. He's pretty close to my age (I'm 14). I'll be talking to him and I'll mention my friend, then I go way off topic about how she steals things from me and how I think she'll become exactly like me and how she can hear my thoughts. It eventually turns into full on yelling because I'm so mad about it. He gets really mad at me for ranting like this, but he doesn't understand how scary it can be for me when I convince myself of this. I need advice. I even try to explain to him but he still gets mad.

Like I will be in a meeting and think that I've just yelled for no reason and everybody looked at me, but it clearly didn't happen. Sometimes the thought is so strong I want to hold my lips or just hum to confirm that my mouth isn't moving and that the noise I'm making isn't talking. Other times it'll be that I've told somebody something and they react like ""WTF"" but it clearly didn't happen. It'll be so strong that I need to talk to them about something just to see if everything's cool, instead of asking them ""did I just say some weird shit?""

27,"Hi everyone,
I‘ve been seeing a therapist for about 9 months now. Since she is my first therapist I cannot make any comparisons but I think she is doing a good job. Due to my own fault, I am wondering whether I should change my therapist (explanation below):

Looking back, I think I have had mental health issues since I‘m 14 or 15 (23 now), including extremely low self-esteem for no reason (I get along well with everyone, never experiences bullying or abuse, I‘ve always been good in school and at university and I‘ve been very active in different sports for many years), which results in self-hate and the wish to die a quick and soon death. Since being 14/15, I have also thought about killing myself but I usually come to the conclusion that I am not worth doing myself that favour and that it would be unfair towards the people in my life who would not understand why I did that. Further, since being a teen, I’ve constantly felt lonely although I have a great family and awesome friends and until today I think I don‘t deserve anyone even noticing me. I crave for a relationship because I would love to be able to have someone for tight hugs and someone who trusts me so I can help them whenever they are struggling. I also fall in love very easily. However, I‘ve never even been on a date because my low self-esteem tells me that if I really really like a guy, I should not start anything with him because I love him and want him to have someone who is worth it (which, in my thoughts, can be anyone but me). 

So, about a year ago everything went rather bad and I could hardly sleep for about three months, spent several hours per day crying etc and I eventually went to see my family doctor and she sent me to a therapist. So, I‘ve been seeing her for about 9 months now. I know that I need to be open in therapy etc and I want that but I have come to realise that without me specifically saying that to her, my therapist thinks it all started last summer. By this I mean to say that I told her how shitty I feel and that there is no trauma from my childhood I need to work on etc and she has been focusing on medication and coping mechanisms in moments of distress so far. I think she did ask me once or twice whether it‘s a new problem and I said yes but not because I lied to her but because, in terms of intensity, it DID start about a year ago. Then, however, I came to realise that probably she is supposed to know that I have been thinking about myself as an ugly, useless piece of shit which should not have been born and that I have thought about killing myself for several years ... don‘t ask my why this only occurred to me that late, just stupidity I guess.

So, anyways, she doesn‘t know and I know I should tell her ... but I feel so weird coming up now telling her by the way I‘ve never told you the whole story. I mean, it‘s not that I didn‘t trust her or the like, I think I was just overwhelmed by the intensity this problem took about a year ago that I saw it as a new issue I need a therapist for. Whatever happened in the years before I just considered being part of me ... but I guess it‘s not, it‘s part of the whole story. 
So, although I like her I am thinking about whether I should go see another therapist to tell him/her the whole story ... I fear she might feel irritated or disappointed if I come and tell her now that, over the course of 9 months, I have never told her the full story. I don‘t want her to think I lied or didn‘t trust her.

What do you think?",18Jul2019,1
28,"I (23F) started having vivid suicidal thoughts yesterday. I have briefly thought about it before, but this time around I was picturing taking up the knife and bleeding to death. I also felt for my arteries (jugular) and placed a heavy knife against my skin, trying to feel how hard it would be to slash through skin. Something I have never done before. I didn't have the courage to do it either.

I think what triggered the thoughts was a fight with my boyfriend. We have been fighting for a few days about how I was adamant about refusing to accept a mistake, and in the process, I have realised that he doesn't really trust me. The fight is lengthy and there are too many details, but we both made some mistakes and have been trying to make amends. I started having suicidal thoughts after my realisation. 

I think there is a deeper cause to all this because after the realisation, I was hit by a wave of loneliness. To add some context, I have been living away from family for around 5 years now. My parents live abroad. I graduated recently and got a job in the same city as my alma mater and boyfriend, but my close friends have all moved elsewhere. 

I used to have a lot of panic attacks before I met my boyfriend (around 9 months back). I would be hit with waves of panic and loneliness because I felt I had nothing to hold on to. I don't really have a home, and the only reason I chose to stay back in the same city was because I wanted a semblance of permanence, though I know that is not possible. 

People have tried telling me that this is normal and a phase that everyone goes through. I am kind of sick of hearing that. Also, my boyfriend will mostly be moving abroad in another year’s time, so he will not be around after some time. 

I don't know what to do, though intuition strongly tells me that I need help.",18Jul2019,1
29,"I just joined this subreddit and I hope this is the right place to go about this
I’m 15f and i lost my mother 3 years ago due to alcoholism. Before she died, my life was pretty bad. It’s nothing compared some people, but since I’ve grown up in a middle class suburb, most of my friends don’t really understand. My parents were constantly drunk and screaming at each other, and sometimes the fights would get physical and the police would get called. My dad was held for three weeks in jail, but my mom just said that he was “staying at a hotel for a little while”. My sister is a type 1 diabetic and started starving herself because she didn’t think she was skinny enough. That led to her having low blood sugar all the time, and since my parents were most of the time drunk, I had to take care of her. There were a lot of times we couldn’t get her back up, and so we had to call the fire department so much so that i almost knew all the firefighters. She got really depressed, and I remember walking into her room once just to see her with a cord tied around her neck. She also tried to overdose on Advil, and got addicted to laxatives. She constantly threatened to run away from home, and I would have to beg her to stay. One day, she decided to call cps on our parents for being alcoholics and driving with us while under the influence, and we were almost taken away. I didn’t want my family to separate -no matter what happened I still loved them- so I lied and said that everything was fine. 

My mom went to the hospital because she developed several ulcers and brain swelling. She died a few days afterward due to organ failure. My entire life seemed to crumble apart. Everything that didn’t affect me before suddenly did, and i fell into depression. I went to see a therapist, and she told me that I had developed chronic depression and that I bottled in everything. She put me on pills, but I didn’t feel any happier. I constantly asked her to up the dose - I wanted to feel numb. But she said that the pills don’t work that way, so I stopped taking them all together and tried to get through shit on my own. 

School and friends were a great distraction, so I just focused more time on them and tried to ignore the painful memories in the back of my mind. My father stopped drinking after what happened with my mother, and my sister no longer has anorexia (she still goes low but not often). My life became way better than ever before. It feels normal. I want it to stay normal. 

But my past creeps up on me. For a year after what happened, I would have attacks every week. They would just be flashbacks, but not like when you see the memory play out in front of you. They were images of everything that happened -my sisters attempted suicide, cps lady questioning me, my mother lying in a hospital bed with cords connected to every part of her. I’ll start hyperventilating and uncontrollably shiver as if it’s suddenly freezing. It feels as if I’m physically in pain, even though nothing is touching me. Now i only have attacks at least once every two weeks. Sometimes their triggered by things though. I can’t watch hospital dramas, or anything having alcoholics or people on drugs. It’s hard to watch anything with character death. I have to hold my breath every time I pass the hospital my mother died in, and I can’t look at anything that reminds me of any time after 2013 and before 2017.

I don’t want to go back to a therapist because I know they’ll just put me on pills again, but I don’t know how to help myself grow out of it. I want to remember my past without having attacks, but because I’ve been ignoring it for so long, its hard to fix. My life has never been better right now and I love it, but my past always haunts me. 

I don’t think I have depression anymore, but I honestly don’t know. What should I do? What would help?",18Jul2019,0
30,"Just another panic attack.

I feel like I need to see a doctor, and I really hate going to the doctor. I always told myself I don't need meds and I can learn to control it. But I feel like I am sinking and it really hasn't gotten any better.

I think I have a mood disorder or some kind of anxiety disorder. I've suffered from panic disorder and depression since my teens, but I think it's more than that.

My mood doesn't stay constant, it's it always jumping from extreme to extreme. Someone I love can become someone I despise overnight, for no real reason, it sounds crazy and I cannot explain it. I can randomly get super depressed where I will just lay on the floor and cry for no reason out of nowhere, then an hour later, it's like it never happened. 

Sometimes I will just get furious for no reason. Like a switch flicked in my brain and I suddenly want to cuss out everyone in sight, I want to quit my job, and I feel like everyone I had ever known secretly hates me and/or has betrayed me. Thankfully this one is rare.

Sometimes I will just get super anxious, but not like a panic attack. I will get this euphoric adrenaline rush out of the blue, where my heart rate speeds way up for no reason, I sweat, I get paranoid, I will sometimes just stare at a wall or walk in a circle for literal hours, every little bad thing that happens triggers a monumental breakdown, my hands are shaky, and I'll be noticeably jittery. This can last a few hours, but up to a few days. 

I suffer from trichotillomania, which causes me to rip out hair as a stress coping mechanism, I finally got myself to stop and my scars are slowly going away. 

I'm scared I'm going to have a heart attack. When I go through these extreme spells of anger and anxiety, I get mild chest pains and I can feel my blood pressure soaring. I had healthy blood pressure when I got checked 8 months ago and I'm a healthy weight, but I'm still concerned.",18Jul2019,1

Living with anxiety and a partner with BPD and depression, our apartment has spiraled completely out of control.

I'm talking moldy food in the sink, clothes all over the floor, spills on the carpet, no walking space, haven't used the kitchen in 6 months because I'm pretty sure anything made in there will literally kill someone. We haven't even slept on a bed for 13 months and I have to see a chiropractor weekly because my SO completely trashed the bedroom and refuses to help clean it so I can open the mattress I bought and set it up.

SO is leaving to spend time with his parents for a few weeks in two days, and I want to take back my life. I want a bed, I want space to do art, and I want to be able to actually breathe in my apartment instead of feeling like I'm having asthma issues.

The problem is that theres so much to do that its overwhelming. And I'm afraid of doing some stuff like the dishes because they are moldy and most of my anxiety is health related.

36,"This is a weird question.. Sorry if this is not the place for this. I will try to be as descriptive as possible.  This is 100% serious and it may sound hard to belive but trust me. The backstory is gonna be long because i want to describe this in ful lto give you guys the best idea what my expirience has been.

About 4 years ago when i was about 19 i got a korbid facination with the dark side of the internet. Ironically reddit is what started it. I read an askreddit thread about the most disturbing things redditors have ever witnessed. It was a morbidly facinating expirience and gave me a small look into the darker side of the world. This id what started it out.  As time went on i went from reading just peoples expiriences to seeing the most disturbing photos (ive seen them all. I doubt theres any famous real disturbing photos readily available on the internet i havent seen) and it made ky morbid facination even deeper. But also seemed to change my look at life and reality as a whole. Though this was far from the end.  

Eventually i wanted to see the most disturbing videos. Surely enough there was a huge thread about it on reddit. I saw the first result""3 guys1 hammer"" and went to watch it, not believing it could be as bad as it was. Needless to say it was (and still is) the most disturbing thing ive ever seen. I couldnt watch it all the way through the first time. It was fucking horrific. Absolutly horrific. Seeing that man being tortured like that. Somehow stil alive. When he started moaning in agony i had to stop it. For days afterwards i felt disconnected from myself.. Just emptyness. I could not get the sounds and images out of my head. They would randomly pop up in my mind and give me this empty feeling of despair every time.  Then i told a family member about it amd they wanted to see it. I had no desire to see it again but watched it with them anyways. This started a vicious cycle. 

Researching what happened only made it worse. It added the thought of the mans family seeing the video of his brutal murder to the intrusive thoughts. The fact that the man had just started recovering from throat cancer only made it worse. 

It would invade my thoughts everyday it would ruin my mood. It would make it hard for me to sleep. I had nightmares. (The killers stalking outside my houee. The murdered man opening his eyes through a hammer smashed face) 

I tried watching the video again to desensetize myself. It was like a horrible cycle of despair inteusive thoughts, then a curiousity to watch it again because my mind wouldnt stop thinking about it yet i would keep forgetting various aspects of what happened. This went on for about a year and a half before i finally vowed to never watch it again (3 years ago)

But it is still as fresh in my mind as it was back then. I remember almost every detail. That man groaning in agony while choking on blood through a hammer smashed face is burned into my brain. I have intrusive thoughts about it almost every day. It stillmakes me feel the sense of rage and despair. If i see someone using a hammer as a tool it literally upsets me to the point of tears. Lately its been popping up in my hesd constantly. It us seriously getting to me. I cant focus at work. My memory and focus are fucked up. The memories burnt into ky brain keep me up at night. The video was taken in a forest on a hot summer day in the ukraine. While i dont live in the ukraine i live in a similar heavily forested northern region (on the opposite side of the world though) and bright sunny summer days seem to actually make me feel this empty numb anxious apathetic almost fearful feeling. It reminds me of how the weather looked in that video. It brings it up fresh in my mind. 

I dont want to think about this. I dont want to remember. I dont want to hear that mans choked moans of agony in my fucking head everyday. I never truly feel safe or relaxed. This expirience has changed me and not for the better. I know this us stupid because it was just a video but thishas been causing me issues for years and i dont know why. Does anyone know what this is? I dont think just witnissing something onvideo can cause ptsd but it clearlydid something

37,"As someone who knows next to nothing but the basics of the human body and neurochemistry, can anyone tell me if regular consumption of alcohol has an impact on serotonin production.

I've been suffering from a bout of depression for close to six months now, and drinking fairly regularly throughout this time period.

For the last 3 weeks or so however I've been in a position where I haven't been able to consume alcohol. This is the longest I've been sober for at least 4 years.

However I feel like I'm improving, each day I feel slightly better and more motivated to get everything together, so I was wondering if there is any documented correlation between the consumption of alcohol and the production of serotonin, and whether I should try and keep abstaining from alcohol.

38,"Sometimes certain people especially ones I feel close to or look up to will do/say things that trigger an... angry? response from me. Normally the cause is when people do/say things with little or no good reason given as to why when asked. Like even an answer as simple as ""I don't know"" would be fine! I just want them to think about why. 

A basic example of this would be someone using/asserting stereotypes repeatedly and without real reason, except for the fact the entity(s) which they're referring to fits the stereotyped groups which they are using eg, being a certain race, having a certain economic status, being attractive/unattractive, being straight/gay,
etc etc etc

Typically I will initially become agitated, even angry sometimes, after a while, I end up feeling bad that I reacted as such, even if the people who caused it don't know the reaction even happened, for example, if the discussion that started the reaction occurred through text.

After being angry and stuff I always end up with a spiteful attitude towards just everyone around because it seems like so many people do this.
And even more so towards myself for allowing myself to get upset over something so petty, the final steps of this mood tend towards including thoughts of self-harm and the literally thinking the quotes: ""I want to/I should just kill myself"" Even though there's no intention behind the latter thoughts, even if the self-harm ones have kinda gotten to me before, but in no serious manor. 

These moods can be triggered literally by a single conversation and can last anywhere from 30 minutes to a day or two and I need to know why. All of this can typically be avoided by keeping away from some topics I know certain people aren't willing to think about why or give reasons to why they're doing or saying such things, but I feel as if most people fall into that camp sometimes and it literally has ruined days for me. 

This is me saying I don't know why I react like this and I'm trying to figure out why because it's making my life worse and I want to try and stop it.",18Jul2019,1
39,"I feel like this was one of the way to make me felt better of this situation, seeing that I can’t vent my anger. I literally can’t. Shouting, throwing thing, I can’t do it and I don’t know why. I just found this wonderful community and hope for some kind of help for my psych, seeing I don’t have someone like that in real life. I don’t really had a friend in real life, and even then I can’t really tell them my inner turmoil.

here’s the situation. I was one of the famous one  in all my community because basically everyone considered me a freak, and after I started my uni and diagnosed with anxiety and OCD, I was treated and I felt that I could interacted with other more normally, if that even a word. But it still really hard for me to make friend, because basically I already had that label.

so I really had limited friend.

one of the people I considered friends is this boy. he’s actually my brother’s friend from high school, one year below me, and last year I met him in my uni and I found out that he also took the same major as me. (my brother study abroad). We then become friend.

after I graduate I get some depression, which then make me want to find another job which really different from my major I took in uni. my major is kinda prestigious one, and took really long to finished, so everyone in my family felt it was a shame to change profession before I even started it. But still, I feel like I can’t do it. it’s to much responsibility, I can’t take it, especially in this situation. I actually felt this when I was still in uni, and I kinda afraid to let my family down if I drop out, but I’ve never been more sure that I can’t do it now after I graduate.

Yesterday I found out from my brother that he’s been telling his friend from his high school group that I don’t want to continue my profession anymore (my brother is in the same group). at that moment I felt really hurt. I don’t know, maybe he don’t know that it will hurt my feeling, but it still hurt. It really didn’t help my situation at all. And it was on a group chat, might just tell the whole world why don’t you.

I try to convinced my self that he didn’t mean it, or maybe he didn’t know that I had this depression, but it didn’t help the hurt. and especially I think I hurt my brother. it’s like throwing a mud in my brother face. i felt like i’m such a worthless person and it’s suck. it suck so bad because my brother didn’t deserve this. I just tired of pretending that everything is fine, because it’s not. I was really hurt with this boy action to the point that i had to vent it somewhere. 

I felt like really, i knew it all along, why bother make friends in the first place. I was copping dealing it all alone this whole years, my problem, anxiety, worthlessness, anger, everything. if i had to socialised i can do it with stranger. attachment really is not good, and it never will.

sorry for ranting. i just need to get it out of my chest, you know, because one of the advice my doctor told me is just improve communications, but i just really can’t. have a good day.",18Jul2019,1

Being ridiculed by my peers, not being encouraged by my parents I ended up not learning it at all, and as the years passed it turned into a source of crippling insecurity. Now every time I think of trying to learn it, I feel such a strong mental blockade and feeling of shame that I wanna supress the thought even further.

I’m a male in my early 20s. I’ve been “weird” for as long as I can remember. I guess things don’t click for me as they do for other people. I think I might be a sociopath or maybe I’m schizophrenic. I get lost inside my head all the time. My own thoughts will keep me from being able to hear what people are saying. 

Most of the time I feel like I’m putting on an act around people. Unfortunately 9 times out of 10 I have to be wasted to not get distracted and caught up in my head. 

I’ve had a few moments of what I assume to be psychosis. One instance, I was surrounded by people who I considered friends, but yet every word that came from their mouths was some insult towards me. It made me so uncomfortable I just abruptly left. As I walked past people on the streets, they would say similar things. 

Another time I was just in my room and overheard my roommates talking, their normal conversation turned into, what sounded like, them mocking everything I was doing within my room. As if they were somehow watching. 

The shittiest part about those situations is that I am left with only two possibilities and I don’t know what’s worse:

1. I’m insane.
2. My friends actually hate me. 

Those were the some most intense moments I’ve had but yet I still feel like I get caught up in my head. I’m in a relationship and I can’t hold a conversation with the girl i love. So much of the time it’s like I have something to say but I get lost searching for it inside my brain. 

I feel like I’m slowly decaying inside my head. Life has no purpose and I find joy in nothing. I’m just watching myself sink deeper and I can’t find a way to do anything about it.

&amp;#x200B;

this family member of mine... i literally dont talk to at all, i have no conversation with him ever, and hes so rude all the time that i dont even bother to try to talk to him anymore. hes the type of person that if you give them a thoughtful expensive christmas gift, he'd smash it to pieces in front of you and say ""i didnt want it"", then accept a gift from a stranger and be very thankful for it. 

&amp;#x200B;

so i walked by my family members room, i went to the refrigerator to get a drink, and this unprovoked family member told me that ""i have issues"" and that i ""need to go to rehab because im on medication"". i didnt say anything to him for him to say this to me, but i just replied back to him after that by saying ""okayyyyyyyy"" and then proceeded to get my drink and go back to my room and close the door. 

&amp;#x200B;

this family member of mine is literally on 17 medications and gives them away to people because he doesnt actually need them. then he has the nerve to judge me? ...im only on 3 medications (1 for epilepsy/convulsions, 1 for depression/anxiety, 1 for PTSD/sleep). my epilepsy medication is life sustaining, the other 2 i only take once a day.

&amp;#x200B;

i was so upset all night over these comments he made to me, it felt so unnesecessary, so unprovoked, and completely ignorant to say to somebody.

after i told you all about his background with his 17 medications, why would he suggest ME going to rehab for taking 3 medications? this family member is addicted to benzos as well... isnt that something HE needs to go to rehab for? yesterday he literally took 5 pills in 4 hours and hes only prescribed them 1 per 24 hours because of how strong they are

46,"So I am a 21 year old girl who has struggled a lot with mental illness. I have depression, anxiety, PTSD, self harm issues, body dysmorphia and an eating disorder (anorexia/orthorexia). I would say I'm relatively high functioning as I get really good grades in college and outwardly appear mentally stable. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a huge problem. Anytime I read about or even hear about a mental health symptom I start to experience it. For example, I got a weighted blanket and loved it. A friend mentioned that theirs gave them anxiety and after that I got panic attacks by even touching the blanket. If someone mentions a type of anxiety or nightmare I start to feel it too in my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some of my friends were complaining about their skin aging prematurely. I literally have a baby face and people think I'm like 14. After that when I looked in the mirror I saw my face literally age and my body dysmorphia manifested in tons of wrinkles on my face. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its not like I'm afraid/self diagnosing with things that I don't have. I just basically start to physically experience those same problems. Someone complained that when they smoke weed they feel sick to their stomach. Weed has ALWAYS helped my nausea and made me feel better. After that I smoked and I literally felt like I was going to throw up the entire time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I randomly read that people with depression can suffer with waking up early and now I've been waking up everyday around 3-5 AM for the past couple months involuntarily. 

&amp;#x200B;

It might also be worth mentioning that I am an extremely sensitive and deeply empathetic person. My friends say that my empathy is my most prominent personality trait. If I'm walking home from the grocery store and see a homeless person I literally will give them all of my groceries and be deeply upset by their situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone else experienced this? Is this normal? Idk. Its making me exhausted.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:

Anytime someone mentions something that gives them anxiety or a mental health symptom I literally will start to experience it to the point where I avoid reading about anything because it makes my life harder.",18Jul2019,1

""My story"":
I had a rough childhood, my dad was an alcoholic and diagnosed with depressions. He would always be mad, shout at me or cry but never hit me. 
There was one 'special' night when I was about 8/9 years old and my mom was visiting her parents and I was alone with my dad. He eventually got really drunk, passed out in Front of the tv and snored very loud. I went up and checked on him and I got scared because I knew he drank. I Woke him up and asked him for the Phone number. It was the wrong one but i didnt know that, so I called this number like 200x Times crying and sobbing in my bed. Of course, nobody picked up the call. I dont remember much, but I went into my parents bathroom and took like 10 random pills hoping it would kill me. But it did not, because I Woke up the next morning completely fine. 
I cant really remember anything else than this night from my childhood...Right now I am 23 years old so it was Not that long ago but i literally have no real memory .

1 or 2 years later my father got hospitalized for around 3 months and came back pretty ""normal"". He is still consuming alcohol but not as much as before and only on events.
I didnt see him for this 3 months and the First thing I hear is ""omg u became so fat in 3 months?""
Thanks dad! 
The 'other' Problem I had with my parents is to meet their expecation. Even in elementary school I remember a test which I 'failed' because I got a C+. I got shouted at so harshly. This still kept going until finishing my school at 18 years old.
A grade below B was a disappointment for them and resulting in no tv/pc/friends.

I was about 13 years old when I got my First D in school, it was a small vocabulary Test in spanish. So I went home, sitting in my room thinking how big of a failure I am and how I am gonna explain that to my parents. 
This was the day I started cutting myself for 6 years.
Of course I got into big trouble because of my 'horrible' grade. 
My grades went from A-B to a lot of Cs,Ds and Es. This resulted in a wonderful time at home....

Some random memories:

'You are  a failure"" ""You wont be able to go to university"" ""You want more food? Youre fat enough"" 
One time I went to school, our kitchen window was open and I heard my mom shouting ""I hate this bitch"" because one shoe pair was not accurately next to the others..

At the age of 16 I was walking my dog,I was trying to burn myself with a piece of Paper, got scared and threw the burning paper in a garbage bin which resulted in a fire and Police investigations. The next day a police officer was at our door. You can imagine what happened next... at the end I had to pay 'my attorney' around 600 $. I didnt even want one, my parents hired him.

I bought a PC Controller for about 40$ without asking my parents for permission. They confiscated it and my father completely emptied my bankaccount because ""I am not able to Use my money"". I was 15 years old...

I was never allowed to sleep at friends houses or have  a friend over for a sleepover. Even inviting friends to my home was a huge discussion about how long they will stay and that they go before the dinner is ready.



I am so sorry for this Text, it has no order just random shit which all comes to my mind right now as I am writing this.




At 18 years, I got a tattoo to stop me from selfharming and moved out. 
The relationship with my parents improved. But I still cant Talk to them a personal stuff. They dont know that I cut myself, had 2 boyfriends and rightnow a girlfriend.
 
But now 5 years later I have the feeling that now everything from my past comes back attacking my mental health.
I cant feel happiness, I cant feel anything except sadness and anger. I cant get up from my bed, I dont shower anymore because I just CANT. I cant get myself to do anything. Even to go out to get something to eat takes like 2 hours. I just sit on my couch, smoking and starring into my phone for literally 1-3 hours before I am able to stand up. 
I love gaming, I used to play around 4-16 hours a day having a ton of fun. Now I cant even motivate me to switch my pc on.
I havent brushed my teeth since 3 years, take a shower like very 2-3 weeks and didnt wash my clothes for like 2 months. I feel so fucking horrible ffs


Another Problem is that I am not able to look somebody in the eyes. I just cant look. And the worst is speaking in Front of other people, in these Moments I just wanna die, literally. When I am in public, it Feels like everyone is looking at me and judging me because of my weight. I hate the way I look -_-


Next huge Problem is my gf. We are together since 2,5 years and live together since 2 years but since at least 1 year I have absolutely no feelings for her anymore. 
In general, I lost all feelings. I've lost my libido, too.
But I cant tell her, because it would break her. And I dont know what to do, I really dont.



I came to the conclusion that I cant live like this anymore. But I literally never talked to anybody in Person about these topics not even with my gf. 



How can I convince my self to see a therapist?

And do you guys think I am only suffering from depressions or could it be more complicated?


(And another quick question, my supervisor asked me whats wrong and if I wanted to talk. Should I try to share my Story the First time in my life? 
I dont know why, but I would rather tell him everything than my gf. But then I feel bad for her :(
I have a good relationship with him and he wont fire me thats 100% sure.)",18Jul2019,2

I used to be the highest achiever in my year, now I don't work anymore and my grades are slipping, some subjects just 5% off failing. I'm over it all.

I can't talk to anyone, because I seem like such a happy person at school - laughing, joking, smiling. Everybody likes me. I'm just that though. The guy that everyone likes, background noise to make the day a little more bearable in our final year. Nobody contacts me. Nobody asks me how I am. I try to reach out and never seem to be able to connect with anyone. There's no way I could talk to my family about this. Well, I have already. I'm meant to be going to therapy, but they're tentative. Maybe they're to scared to admit that their own son doesn't want to wake up anymore. I couldn't talk again now though. Still waiting for my first appointment, which I'm not allowed to book. I couldn't talk to them now though. We've had a fight. Just like every other day. This is shit.

My head hurts and I just want to sleep. All I want in my life is love.

I can only stay at the library for another hour and a half before it closes, then I have to go back so I can be berated again. Jesus Christ nothing matters any more.

55,"Hi everyone,
I‘ve been seeing a therapist for about 9 months now. Since she is my first therapist I cannot make any comparisons but I think she is doing a good job. Due to my own fault, I am wondering whether I should change my therapist (explanation below):

Looking back, I think I have had mental health issues since I‘m 14 or 15 (23 now), including extremely low self-esteem for no reason (I get along well with everyone, never experiences bullying or abuse, I‘ve always been good in school and at university and I‘ve been very active in different sports for many years), which results in self-hate and the wish to die a quick and soon death. Since being 14/15, I have also thought about killing myself but I usually come to the conclusion that I am not worth doing myself that favour and that it would be unfair towards the people in my life who would not understand why I did that. Further, since being a teen, I’ve constantly felt lonely although I have a great family and awesome friends and until today I think I don‘t deserve anyone even noticing me. I crave for a relationship because I would love to be able to have someone for tight hugs and someone who trusts me so I can help them whenever they are struggling. I also fall in love very easily. However, I‘ve never even been on a date because my low self-esteem tells me that if I really really like a guy, I should not start anything with him because I love him and want him to have someone who is worth it (which, in my thoughts, can be anyone but me). 

So, about a year ago everything went rather bad and I could hardly sleep for about three months, spent several hours per day crying etc and I eventually went to see my family doctor and she sent me to a therapist. So, I‘ve been seeing her for about 9 months now. I know that I need to be open in therapy etc and I want that but I have come to realise that without me specifically saying that to her, my therapist thinks it all started last summer. By this I mean to say that I told her how shitty I feel and that there is no trauma from my childhood I need to work on etc and she has been focusing on medication and coping mechanisms in moments of distress so far. I think she did ask me once or twice whether it‘s a new problem and I said yes but not because I lied to her but because, in terms of intensity, it DID start about a year ago. Then, however, I came to realise that probably she is supposed to know that I have been thinking about myself as an ugly, useless piece of shit which should not have been born and that I have thought about killing myself for several years ... don‘t ask my why this only occurred to me that late, just stupidity I guess.

So, anyways, she doesn‘t know and I know I should tell her ... but I feel so weird coming up now telling her by the way I‘ve never told you the whole story. I mean, it‘s not that I didn‘t trust her or the like, I think I was just overwhelmed by the intensity this problem took about a year ago that I saw it as a new issue I need a therapist for. Whatever happened in the years before I just considered being part of me ... but I guess it‘s not, it‘s part of the whole story. 
So, although I like her I am thinking about whether I should go see another therapist to tell him/her the whole story ... I fear she might feel irritated or disappointed if I come and tell her now that, over the course of 9 months, I have never told her the full story. I don‘t want her to think I lied or didn‘t trust her.

My friends know they have always been a much needed escape for me and I'm worried that if we did share a living space I might loose that. But then again i might just be totally overthinking it and it wouldn't be an issue at all

&amp;#x200B;

To start: I started seeing a therapist for my anxiety and depression a few weeks ago, and I currently take anti-anxiety medicine.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel... lost. I am almost 30 years old. I recently started at what I thought was my dream job, but really, I can't make up my mind over it. Like... 50% of the time, I'm miserable thinking about my upcoming work day, mainly because of client phone calls, which I despise for some reason, even though I do well on them. 

But overall, the job is decent money, and I get to work from home. What makes it bearable is that I can have Netflix on in the background while I get my tasks done. Other than that, since I live alone, I'm lonely as hell.

&amp;#x200B;

At some points, I want to quit because I'm generally unhappy, but at other times, I'm thinking several things:

\- My job is super crucial to the company. Without me, the company will be in big trouble. If I leave, I'd make sure I at least gave them a month's notice and make sure all my duties are covered for the foreseeable future.

\- I just started at this job less than 2 months ago. I feel like I haven't given it enough of a chance. Honestly, I didn't start feeling like this until my co-worker in the same department walked out without any notice, leaving me with a huge burden - maybe that's why I feel so overwhelmed.

\- I was miserable at my last job, hence why I was so desperate to leave. I worked there for almost 3 years, the job before that for 3 years (I left when the boss announced he was selling the company), and the job before that (which I absolutely loved, but was laid off due to slowdown in business) for roughly 8 months. I'm scared of my resume showing that I'm a job hopper. At my age, I don't think I can afford to be picky with my job choices, especially since I'll soon have a mortgage.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what I'm asking is, is this a normal feeling? Do people get into these weird funks, even with their dream jobs? I almost quit last week but I realized that I can't just quit whenever I'm stressed. Every job has stress. I'm an adult and need to take responsibility.

&amp;#x200B;

I constantly look up jobs on LinkedIn and Craigslist and think how they're probably much better, but it could just be a case of ""the grass is always greener."" I just don't know what to do. I'm going to talk to my therapist about this when I see her on Monday, but I thought I'd pose this question to Reddit in case anyone has any insight.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I've also started telling myself, ""your job is not that bad,"" every morning to help instill that feeling in my mind. I mean, I used to work in a call center from 10-7 and get yelled at all day. THAT was a nightmare and a half, and I realize I could still be working there, where I was 10x miserable.",18Jul2019,1

I thought about going to therapy over it, even if just to gain some insight, but I also know that Ill be moving away from her off to college. Its going to be a move across the ocean (anxiety for another day) in Augusr so I wont be seeing her at all so I wonder if its even worth it.

Only a very few things excite me like watching Naruto that brings up my motivation or do programming that makes me think well and excites the solution to a problem. My dream of becoming a successful person in every part of life is another dream that brings excitement and other positive feelings. Except these 2-3 things, nothing much excites me and I feel so, complete in myself. (it's not like I don't care about others, it's just, complete in myself as well)

I was with this girl, she is still my friend, she was very friendly in start, we spent a lot of time together, then she left me alone for months because she couldn't handle me and was in her own issues as she said and now, I just feel like I don't want to connect with anyone so deeply again.

69,"I'm new to this debilitating mental state of Hypochondria, and it's taking over my life. 

Okay, so let me start from the beginning.

About 15 years ago, I was in a serious car accident. We flipped 8 times (according to the police report, the counted the markings on the road to determine) but I was knocked unconscious. It had essentially ""bruised"" my brain (for a lack of better words) and caused some of my brains electrical communications to go a little wonky. After a few doctors visits and trips to the neurologist, things were finally normal. My brain/electrical waves were back to normal and I thought it was over.

Skip to a year later, watching TV at my home, when all of the sudden my heart started racing, the world was spinning around me but it was like I was in slow motion, I was sweating, couldn't catch my breath, it felt like my heading was full of so much pressure that my eyes were going to burst, I started vomiting and that was it.... I thought I was dying for what felt like an eternity (in all actuality, it was about 5 minutes). That was my first panic attack.

Since that day, I would battle panic attacks almost daily. Daily turned to weekly, weekly turned to monthly and then eventually, they only decided to show their ugly face every once in a while.

Until 5 years ago when they came back, seemingly out of nowhere. I could be in the middle of a conversation, laughing and BOOM, panic attack. It was happening multiple times a day, for months. I finally decided to get help. I went to therapy, I tried medication after medication after medication but nothing was working. I had finally found a therapist that got me, she understood what I was going through, she listened with her heart and she did help. She explained that I have a specific anxiety issue called a Panic Disorder. My brain misfires and send me into 'fight or flight' for no reason whatsoever. But, like generalized anxiety, my panic disorder would also kick into high gear in stressful situations as well. She found a medication that was a winner... (Effexor, if you're curious). Things were finally looking up, I thought ""man, I can breathe again"" I felt like myself for the first time in years. But don't worry, it didn't last.

Fast forward to the middle of 2018 to present day.

My husband and I were trying for a child, my doctor suggested that I wean off of the Effexor that I had been on for the better part of 4 years. I have PCOS and if you know what that is, great but if not, it means that my chances of having a child are very slim. The doctor said that she would like to take away any medications that could potentially hinder the possibility even more. So, as painful as it was (if you've never come off of an SSRI, it is the HARDEST thing I've ever done. The withdrawal symptoms are no joke)

Anyway, June of this year... We were on our way back from an out of state trip, I had taken over driving for my husband so he could have a break... And it happened. The panic attack that brought me where I am today.

I skipped a lot of the stressful things going on in my life because, right now, I just need to get this out of my head.

I feel like I'm losing control all over again. Except this time, I'm obsessing over it. I have convinced myself that I have something wrong with my abdomen (appendicitis, at this particular time). I have been stuck in a perpetual panic attack for the last week. I am physically, mentally and emotionally exhausted. I am a healthcare professional and I should know better... I DO know better.

I drove myself to the emergency room 4 days ago because I couldn't stop. I have become obsessed with pressing on my abdomen, looking for pain. Every little twinge I feel, it sends me spiraling into a pit of despair and panic. They did a CT scan and a full panel of blood work and everything came back negative. But even still, I can't stop.

I tried to get in to see my therapist (back in early 2018) and she is no longer practicing in the state. Forcing me to go therapist shopping again. It's hard to find someone that you feel comfortable with and that you trust. After months of waiting, my appointment with a new therapist is coming up next week. It took almost 3 months to get in.

Yesterday I had an appointment with my primary care physician. I explained to her what is going on with my mental state right now. I begged her to press on my abdomen, even though the hospital had already given me a clean bill of health (as far as the CT and blood work goes) and she did. No pain. She told me that if it were appendicitis, the CT scan, blood work and it being pressed on would all tell me. And, like I said, I am a medical professional... I know all these things... But the rational part of my brain is being suppressed by irrational fear and I can't control it.

I spent almost and hour last night pressing all over my abdomen, looking for pain. I don't feel pain, but if I press hard enough, I do. Which I know is because of me. I am causing the pain. If I press and I don't feel pain, I press harder. But why can't I just stop? Why am I obsessing over this? I feel like I'm having a mental break that I can't climb out of it.

When I feel a pain or twinge in my abdomen, I feel like I need to press on it. I feel depressed and stuck. I feel disconnected from the world and like my body is on autopilot. Why can't I believe the doctors and the physical proof from my exams and blood work?

I have tried very hard to stay off the internet (Dr. Google) and trying to control the impulses to press... But I can't stop it. I know that the ""proof is in the pudding"" but my irrational brain keeps telling me its wrong.

I'm losing my mind, I'm living in fear of something that I should not be scared of. My brain is busted and I am scared I will be stuck like this. This week long, perpetual panic attack is killing me.

I have no idea how to cope. I have no idea how to control the compulsion to press on my abdomen. I keep trying to tell myself  ""I'm okay, the tests were fine, two separate doctors told me I was fine, I'm fine, just stop this, why are you going out of your way to look for pain, JUST STOP""

But it doesn't work.

About a year ago I moved into a new job at work. At first it seemed great but it slowly started getting more and more stressful. I’m a graphic designer for a university and the president of the university pulled all the designers across campus to work together in one office. There are way too many things about work to mention here so I’ll just say that it’s caused a lot of stress. 

Then about 7 months ago, my cat, whom I loved like he was my son, was mauled to death by dogs next door. I don’t think I’ll ever get over that. 

And to top it off, my boyfriend of 4.5 years just decided to break up with me kind of out of nowhere because everything felt “forced” and “he didn’t want to force it.” I’m still living with him (I move into a new apt. Sept 2) and have to see him daily. We’ve been friendly but it’s been really strange and awkward and I’m constantly reminded that we’re no longer together. 

I have some major childhood trauma which has given me abandonment issues so, as you can imagine, that made them so much worse. 

Every day when I come home from work I feel so stressed and depressed I want to check myself into a mental institution. I have basically no energy; it’s hard for me to make myself even shower. I usually just don’t. Then in the last week I’ve started getting migraines again after not having had them for a while. 

Right now I’m lying in bed trying to stave off a panic attack, dealing with a migraine, and feeling guilty that I couldn’t make it into work today. 

And yes, I’m in therapy and have been for most of my life. At this point I pretty much know what a therapist is going to tell me before I go. I’m also taking 450 mg of Wellbutrin, 300 mg of Effexor, 600 mg of Trileptal, and Klonopin as needed.

It's basically the title. I'm tired of it, I could be having a great day, I could be proud about some minor achievement and so on till someone tell me about their achievements or their goals. 

It's frustrating cause I want to feel genuinely happy about other but my mind keeps comparing myself to them, if I see someone with very good social skills I start to analyze my social skill and feel bad about myself, if someone has a very clear idea about their career or what they want to do and they are working towards it I feel extremely bad because I'm a total mess who does not know yet what to do. 

And what bothers me the most is that this kind of feeling may develop in me a feeling of envy which is one of my biggest fears. I just try to rationalize with myself and those intrusive though that came after comparing my situation to other's situations. But I'm afraid if that is encouraging this reaction.

Hi. I am not sure if i am depressed or not, but I've been through patch however, not recently, at some point of my life. Overall I can say i am a very sensible person.

It's been a year (or two) that I feel like my head is stiff, not sure how to describe it, and like from the inside it was hit many times (as if someone had been hitting me on my head, maybe around the neck area too). Sometimes I just lay in bed unable to do nothing.

How often I feel like that? More than twice a week. Sometimes it is another feeling: lightheadness, very annoying and disturbing. lack of oxygen feeling . sleep apnea test is good, blood tests are good.

Anyone of you has the same issue? Could it be underlying anxiety? It's taking a toll on me and I'm not able to function normally anymore........",18Jul2019,0
89,"So the relevant background information about me is that I've been very isolated for the past 4 years, which resulted in me having no one to talk to at all. Over the past year I've had some really bad experiences while working (I had a couple internships) which really killed my motivation and morale. I was bottling up all that negativity to the point of not being able to handle it anymore, so I finally decided to get help. Right now I'm on summer break and come September I need to be able to function properly and not break down again. Also I'm 26M.

I've been seeing my current therapist for around a month, and what he's said to me last meeting really made me have doubts about how well he understands me. In order to get more social interaction and not feel so isolated he suggested I get a summer job. Now, from my perspective, not only is this not a good suggestion, it is downright detrimental towards establishing a social circle of any kind. I'm not going to find friends at a job, by the very definition of a job all parties involved are only involved because there's money to be made. You can find good and nice people, but you can also find some downright nasty people. But it's a job so you don't get the luxury of picking and choosing who you interact with, you're gonna interact with whoever your job requires you to interact with. I've said as much to my therapist and he kinda looked at me like I was crazy. Perhaps I'm reading too much into his response, but he sure did not agree with my reservations about workplace dynamics.

Not to mention the issues I'm dealing with right now come from the workplace in the first place. From experience I had to stifle and restrain myself from being my usual self, because my usual self talks too much and is too annoying. Apparently to the point of almost being fired (it was a 6 month long internship, a very small company 5-6 people, so the CEO was the HR dept, and he did not like me). To no ones surprise I'm very apprehensive of work environments, and I can no longer view anyone there as anything other than a coworker/boss. I've made my therapist aware of that in our previous sessions, so when he suggested to go in the blender again it took me aback big time.

I've had a meeting with a different doctor to evaluate if I need any medication or not going forward (his consensus being I don't really need it) and I also asked him the same question. He didn't dismiss my reservations but also said it's a 50/50 whether a hunch like that is accurate and a patient should switch for better results, or if more time is needed for better results. I think that makes perfect sense. So I wonder what other people thought, is that suggestion appropriate? Is it appropriate considering the events that led me to seek/need help in the first place?",18Jul2019,2
90,"Hello! :) This is my first post on Reddit and I really felt the need to share in the name of medical ethics as well as in support of my fellow community of those who struggle with their mental health. Please let me know your thoughts- if this is normal policy and I overreacted/was wrong, if I should report him, or if you have had similar experiences with any of the medications I mentioned.

Background/Facts:

\- I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and depression when I was 19 after years of panic attacks; feelings of hopelessness and despair despite my life being objectively good; physical manifestations of anxiety that were so palpable I thought something was wrong with my heart; etc. You all know the feelings of anxiety coupled with depression, all too well, I am sure.

\- I sought help at 19 and was prescribed Lexapro (10mg/day). It caused weight gain, extreme fatigue, and often curbed my ability to feel deeply, but these were all side effects I was willing to endure because it helped my symptoms so much.

\- I moved and had to start seeing a new psychiatrist at 22. He switched me over to Cymbalta (60mg/day). I wasn't much of a fan of his- he was very cavalier, didn't take an interest in my personal life, had to ask what I did every single session after meeting several times, did not make eye contact, etc. I didn't care too much because I actually liked his recommendation of Cymbalta as it curbed my symptoms of fatigue, and continued to see him. I moved out of the direct area but still live within LA County where he works.

\- Current day: I am 24 and a busy law student. Like I'm sure many of us have, I forgot to call in for a medication refill until I realized I had one pill left. I contacted my psychiatrist the next day to make an appointment so I could have a refill.

\- My previous psychiatrist, as well as other prescribing physicians I have seen, have always authorized refills before I see them again as long as I make an appointment as soon as possible. As medical professionals, they know that if I go a day or two without an antidepressant my brain, the side effects are VERY severe, and agree to the refill before seeing me because of this.

\- My current psychiatrist proceeded to offer me a slot on that same day for an appointment at 5 pm (For those who know LA, his office is in the South Bay while I work in Downtown, so given traffic/distance, that's not feasible). I let him know that I have a summer job and can't do that. He gave me a slot for next week and I accepted it.

\- Upon accepting my upcoming appointment I asked if he could authorize my refill because I had gone the day without and I did not want to go even longer. It is dangerous to do so. The following conversation took place.",18Jul2019,1

|  Hi. I am not sure if i am depressed or not, but I've been through patch however, not recently, at some point of my life. Overall I can say i am a very sensible person. It's been a year (or two) that I feel like my head is stiff, not sure how to describe it, and like from the inside it was hit many times (as if someone had been hitting me on my head, maybe around the neck area too). Sometimes I just lay in bed unable to do nothing. How often I feel like that? More than twice a week. Sometimes it is another feeling: lightheadness, very annoying and disturbing. lack of oxygen feeling . sleep apnea test is good, blood tests are good. Anyone of you has the same issue? Could it be underlying anxiety? It's taking a toll on me and I'm not able to function normally anymore........|||

I have an urge to just post something somewhere, as I have various times before when I've felt like i just needed to vent and scream. But this time I am mentally worn, my brain feels foggy and heavy. And I want to completly call it quits. 

I'm absolutely exhausted and I 'm starting to regret waking up on some days. I'm tired of being too incompetent to do my job, I'm tired of feeling useless and I'm tired of hurting people. I've ruined relationships (both romantic and platonic), endured different issues throughout my life, but I don't want to anymore.

I tried medicine, therapy, everything that has been suggested. It hasn't really helped. Hopefully others who struggle with depression can have a different outcome. I always wanted to be a good and kind person, to bring some light into the world to whoever needed it. Seems like i failed at that to. Suicide is scary and it's not my first time giving it more thought than I should, but come Sunday I want to be done.",18Jul2019,5

I’ve started a mental health blog. It shares my experiences with depression and how I managed to tame it to a point where I can get by. I’m hoping to help others by writing every week. I’m not a very good writer so excuse me for any errors! Also I’ve posted a couple of links to support groups! If anyone is running support groups that they would like shared please message me directly and I’ll post it up! Doesn’t matter if you’re in the US or U.K. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated also. 

Much love!

94,"I posted this in the bipolar section but never showed so maybe it’s more appropriate here. Bipolar women late 20s here! I’m feeling insane and need to vent! Apologies for this long run on rant. Lately feelings from an old relationship, one I have already processed and completely moved on from have been resurfacing. They are eating away at me. Long story short I was in a relationship for a few years in my early 20s. He had a personality disorder and was a handful, completely irrational at times but none the less was the love of my life. Things ended badly and the breakup was not mutual. I did not want it to end but he left and just ghosted me. It was completely out of left field. We lived together and he just up and left one morning with no warning. It fucked me up really bad for a couple years. I went to therapy, worked on myself And finally got over it! I even had another serious relationship after, with someone I cared about and really enjoyed their company. I came to terms with my previous relationship and have not even thought about it in years. Then boom! I start thinking about him and coincidentally he contacts me randomly after almost 10 years of no contact. We talk and I become elated, the conversation makes me so happy and manic but then I remember all the hurt I felt when the relationship ended. All that anger comes back. As the days pass all my feeling return, good and bad but mostly good. I end up breaking plans to get together with him again and Ignore him. It’s been months but I can’t stop obsessively thinking about him. It’s like I’m In love all over again but at the same time I don’t want to ever talk to him again. I just feel like a maniac. When will this end? I feel so dumb because it’s been so long. Is this all because of my bipolar? Is it because it’s true love? Am I just a complete looney girl?",18Jul2019,1

I have had about 6 jobs in the last 7 months, I just can't seem to stay for long, and then I get overwhelmed again and I quit. And I just started a job at an airport and I'm already overwhelmed, I don't think I'll go back. 

I'm 19, and already I've managed to screw up so much. I've been struggling more lately. My boyfriend is gone for work, and won't be back until mid November. We've been dating for 5 months, and I was struggling when I met him, so he knows that I have problems. I'm just so afraid he'll get sick of my inability to hold a job. But I don't know if I can make a commitment to a job right now. I really want to. 

I was going to sell my car, and pay off my debt so I could live off of my SSI, but he doesn't want me to, he made me promise I wouldn't, so I can't do that. 
I just feel so dead. I think I might be relapsing with my eating disorder, and I promised my boyfriend I would stay a healthy weight, but I just can't make myself eat. I have no appetite and I can only eat a little before I get full. 

And without a job I can't pay my car insurance, or any of my bills, so if I don't get another job soon, then I'll have like $300 of unpaid bills. 

I don't even know what to do anymore, I can't think, I've been crying all the time, I'm afraid to leave my apartment.

98,"For about the last 2/3 years, I thought I had BPD. I read so much about it, and I was convinced I had it. About a year and a half ago, I started seeking help for my mental health. I found a psychiatrist I love, went through a bunch of therapist, and for the last few months have been seeing one I really like.

I finally opened up to her about thinking that I had undiagnosed BPD. She told me I didn’t. She explained why, and it made sense. She told me that for extra assurance, ask my psychiatrist. I did and he said I do not have BPD. 

They both agree on my diagnosis: moderate to severe depression and generalized anxiety disorder. 

I trust both of them, and since those conversations, I realize that I don’t have BPD, and that the symptoms of depression and anxiety are often symptoms of other things as well which is why I saw myself in that disorder.

I’m at a loss now. I always felt so broken to my core, but turns out I’m not. Turns out I have trauma I can heal from, coping mechanisms that I can reset, and a whole lot of work ahead of me.

Now I just feel confused and out of place. I thought I was something I’m not. I’m happy to not have a personality disorder, but I now feel mixed up.

I don’t know why I’m sharing, but I wanted to feel heard. This mental health has been hard. I can feel myself changing slowly, but it’s required a lot. I guess I’m just happy to find a community like this.",18Jul2019,18

103,"I was first prescribed antidepressants at 16, the first time I went to the doctor for depression. They just threw them at me essentially. I started out on Sertraline, then moved to Citalopram, then Fluoxetine, then Venlafaxine, with some Quetiapine thrown in mid-citalopram for good measure.

I currently take 187.5mg of Venlafaxine every day (along with esomeprazole and atenolol, for other ailments I believe may be caused by antis).

I want to come off of meds entirely, if not at least to see who I am without them. I've been through a lot and changed a lot in the almost 8 years since my first script, and I'm honestly questioning if I even have the severe depression I was told I had. How am I supposed to know? I was immediately medicated, changing the chemistry of my brain - what if it wasn't wrong before?

I need to know if I can live without the drugs, but my parents don't want me to stop them. They're worried I'll lose my job (lost a job before due to depressive time off), and not be able to pay the bills/mortgage. I think they're also worried I'll attempt, but I never have before so I feel that it's unlikely.

Also, seeing as I have so many other health issues that have popped up in the last 8ish years, I've been really wondering if coming off meds would help them too.

I tossed and turned all night and still could not go to sleep. Out of boredom, I started to write a paper based off of my first real depressive episode that happened about three years ago. At this point I was only diagnosed with mild depression and anxiety. Anyways, stayed up all night, and assumed i would be completely exhausted. However, as morning came, and I climbed out of bed, I felt completely rejuvenated. I felt like I had gotten the best sleep of my life. Went to school feeling better than i ever have in my entire life. Met a girl and thought i fell in love. (still very confusing because i’m not quite sure if that was real or not, could have all been in my head, not the point of this story though). I went home and my parents said that i was acting “different”. I could not explain to them why i was feeling this way, because i was just as confused as they were. “I’m high” I told them. I felt like i was on cloud nine. Thought I had figured out my entire life, figured out that all my seemingly significant problems were but minuscule speed bumps that, in the grand scheme of things, didn’t really matter at all. That night I decided to finish my paper, and boy was the second half different than the first. Did not sleep at all the next night.

Pie Day

1:49 AM

     A faceless man emerges from darkness, and crawls into the light, pulling himself by his arms. Although he has little energy in his body, he has just enough to transport himself to and fro, one arm’s length at time. Onward he pulls, slowly making his way across the unforgiving asphalt, and into common grounds, where he finds man and woman alike, all faceless, grey, and cold. They assemble themselves into a massive concentration, laying side by side, body after body. There they lie, motionless, emotionless, and helpless. Off in the horizon, a new cluster can be seen, advancing ever so slightly. Figures begun to take form, each moving in unison. Torn Cloth and rugged sheets cover some, but not all of the beings. They approach the lifeless pile that lie before them, and without hesitating, begin arranging themselves, one by one, body by body. They position themselves so that they lie ever so slightly above their 


10:27 PM

    A white orb appears, quite literally out of nowhere. Disobeying the laws of physics, or the laws of nature, or the laws of reality, it ascends, moving deliberately yet free. On it goes, soaring through the limitless sky, until it is nothing more than a star among many. As it was meant to be. Covering the sky, a shimmering blanket of illuminating specks appear. And they are deliberate yet free. They move independently from one another, dancing and singing and swaying about. Suddenly, as if the universe were an hourglass, everything changed. Beautiful and vibrant colors explode out of the sky, and tiny, singular dots fill the atmosphere, each with its own individual significance. As the particles fall back down to the earth, and near the fragile crust, they are met with large collections of color, in every aspect of everything. The sun, once completely hidden from the immovable and colorless blanket, is filled with bright yellow particles, all going together to become something greater than themselves. Beauty bounces from corner to corner, lightly grazing its finger over every lilac, every blade of grass, every body of water. And reality finally shows itself, once hidden behind logic and reason.

Sometimes I feel lost in my thoughts, feels like the ""me"" part doesn't belong with my thoughts. That's probably why I had such a problem with mind altering substances, because it was a way to change my thoughts and the way I think.

I've been on 2 rounds of antidepressants when I was 14 and again when I was 18. Nothing works. It feels like I can never escape my anxietys and the way I think. 

I definitely have social anxiety, had depression (depression isn't an issue anymore), it feels like I have PTSD from child trauma, a little bit of adhd and borderline personality.

2 years ago I began trying to cut myself with a blunt piece of metal that had fallen off my suitcase, and used thick blade scissors to nip my arms and stomach. It lasted a few months until i managed to force myself out of it somehow. 

It started again about a year ago or so, I haven't managed to do any real damage and had even thought I was over it a few months ago untll about 4 days ago when the urges came back.

I didn't think it was that bad but I pulled a muscle in my back this morning and the pain was relatively severe considering my lack of pain tolerance, and I found myself enjoying it at times, as if I deserved the pain or just enjoyed it for no reason at all.

I'm really scared and truly believe that given the opportunity, I'll start cutting myself.

Please, give any advice on preventing myself from giving into these horrid urges. I really don't want to go through it again.",18Jul2019,2
125,"This has been eating away at me recently. Maybe because I work with kids more and more now, and because it makes me feel so upset to think about them ending up doing this. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I was younger, in the early 2000s when I was first introduced to the vast infinite space of the internet, somehow I became interested in looking at gory details of crimes. There is the stuff that I do feel like many other perfectly normal people do-- I would search for all the descriptive details about a cult or a serial killer, for example. But then, in searching for those details, I wound up on sites that specifically catered to people interested in seeing photos of crime scenes and dead people. It started with a picture of a dead body in a crime scene from a video, but eventually I wound up seeing a snuff film on one of those sites. It was horrible quality, but it is still seared in my brain. It was made by some men who killed someone and sent the video to his parents. It was pixel-ish, but under no uncertain terms, it was a man being murdered brutally and with pleasure by the murderers. After that I also saw other things that haunt me still-- the too-detailed court testimony of a woman who was raped and her wife murdered in front of her. I saw another video of a man who killed someone and cut him into little pieces. It was like this intense curiosity that turned into self-trauma. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am not saying I received any pleasure from any of these things. That was not what this is about.. but I don't know what it was about at all. There was one time that I told my friend about what I had seen while wasted at a party, and he seemed horrified with me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I still think about the worst of what I had seen when I was younger. Sometimes something that reminds me of it will pop up and it will ruin my whole mood and make me feel sick thinking about what I had seen over 15 years ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

After a few years, I mostly stayed away from the worst of the worst, but I will still seek out the details and read everything I can about intense crimes that make the news. When the New Zealand shooter's video came out, I had to fight absolutely every curious fiber in my body to not find or watch the video. But why? What is wrong with me? Do I need therapy?",18Jul2019,1

Trigger warning for this post
So basically a few years back I struggled with self harm (I’m a couple years clean now) anyway so my rabbit scratched me earlier today in the same area. Basically all day it has been affecting me really bad. I have been trying to distract myself all day an its not been working I just keep feeling bad and that its my fault. It’s just making me feel really rubbish. I have decided to put a plaster over the scratches so i. Can’t see them but I still feel awful. And I just don’t know what to do.",18Jul2019,1

Hi, 

I write this on the eighteenth of July 2019 in a frame of mind that can only be explained as sub par. For the last six weeks or so have been my most miserable weeks that I can remember in the recent past. This is as a result of a whole range of factors, both endogenous and exogenous that have seemingly caused my mental health and ability to think positively to collapse to their foundations. Although I’m not suicidal, I’ve thought about it, I’m fairly sure this is just as a result of a phenomenon called ‘call of void’ that intrigues me yet hasn’t encouraged any thoughts of self harm thankfully. 

So why am I so miserable? I wish I knew, although I can say there have been some monumental events in my life, especially recently that have led my insecurities and poor health to exponentially sky rocket. Theres a lot of baggage, but here we go. 

For context, I’m nineteen, male, live in London, and study at Newcastle University of which I have completed my first year. Although I’ve always been insecure and had a poor self image from having been overweight until recently, of average intelligence, and somewhat average looks at best, recent events have tipped me over the cliff edge into the realm of fuck knows where. 

At university, I met a girl. We met at a house party and dated until the end of year. It was think I’m fairly certain that tipped me over. Having had a poor self image and severely disliking university, suddenly having someone who found me attractive and enjoyed my company made me feel comfortable with who I was finally. I almost felt normal. The few months we dated were the happiest months of my life, I thought more positively about myself, she motivated me to take care of my health more, and motivated me to study harder as she did. However, you can see where this is going. One key detail is that she is/was two years older than I. As I finished my first year of university, she was graduating. This was poor timing to say the least, and that fact ate me alive every single fucking night. When it eventually came the time to have ‘that’ chat about what ‘we’ would do about ‘us’ after university concluded for her, she blanked me, didn’t text me for days and then later replied with the ‘it’s over’ text. Weeks later, I see her online back in her hometown, linking up with her ex. 

This killed me. I felt like a part of me inside shattered into shards too small to piece together again. Having gone from having a severely unhealthy and negative body and self image, to feeling loved and cared about, to suddenly losing all that instantly shot me down to a new low. This was, and is, a low that I reassured myself in the past that I’d never reach yet here I am and I don’t know what to do thus I write this poorly formatted entry. 

I’m on summer break now home in London, working a hard job that although pays well, is gruelling and I’m not in the frame of mind to continue and want to quit but don’t know if I can. My mates are also either working or traveling so few are around but those few are close friends at least. 

I just feel so lost, so stressed, and can’t seem to ever stop thinking about my my rise and fall at university. Regardless, thanks for reading if you made it this far.",18Jul2019,1
128,"My wife (28F) and I (28F) have been married for nearly 5 years, together for 10. Our relationship has its highs and lows, but one thing I've noticed when we're fighting is that if I realize I've made a mistake, I can get hit with just this FLOOD of self-hatred and then I'll end up lashing out and sabotaging my attempts at making amends to her.

For context, I've been diagnosed with ADHD and Generalized Anxiety Disorder as well as Social Anxiety Disorder and I think that these contribute to the intensity of my reactions. Generally, when things are going okay for me I don't experience self-hatred in my day to day life -- though it can come up if I'm thinking over how many times I've gotten in my own way during previous fights and how much I've hurt the woman I love as a result.

Today was a really extreme example of how this can look. My wife said that she was upset by something I had said. She wasn't feeling well today and we'd been planning to go see my parents this evening for the first time in a couple of months. She wanted to push to go tonight, but had said that it might need to not involve a meal because of her nausea (she threw up last night and seems to maybe have a bug). I said something to the effect of ""I've realized that I was actually really hoping to share a meal with my family, so maybe we should reschedule for another time when we can do that."" She said she was upset that I was being ungracious about her pushing to go see them tonight, and that seeing them tonight wouldn't negate the possibility of seeing them again soon for a meal.

I tried apologizing right away (at this point my self-hatred wasn't very loud, and I was determined to navigate the situation gracefully), but I wound up spending most of my apology saying that I wanted to make sure she knew that going tonight ""wasn't her only option"", and that I appreciated her pushing but didn't want her to feel like she *had* to. This bothered her, and she said so. I thought she seemed to be getting pretty angry, so when it was my turn to talk again I began by saying she seemed pretty angry and to let me know if she needed space. This made her feel like I was deflecting and trying to turn things around on her because I wasn't addressing what she had actually *said*. She asked me to take some time, and come back in when I was ready to focus on how I had been ungracious and make a complete apology.

I walked out and almost immediately came back in, eager to prove that I genuinely *wanted* to make a complete apology for being ungracious. I started by saying, ""I can take more time if you want, but I really don't have a problem focusing on how I've been ungracious and trying to apologize for it. I want to do right by you."" And then I launched into a more lengthy apology without giving her a chance to respond. When she did respond, she said that my apology was still incomplete, and that this was why she wanted me to take more time. She said I now also needed to apologize for deflecting and ""putting emotions in her head"" by saying she seemed angry and might need space, and that I should go take some time to reflect.

I did this, and had a breakdown while doing so. I was crying over how I could still get things so wrong when I'm trying so hard to not be stubborn when she tells me I've hurt her feelings in some way (another problem of mine; one that I've been working on a lot recently). I was just feeling like, ""I try so hard, and I *still* end up just piling mistakes onto my mistakes."" I went back in to apologize, at this point feeling thoroughly ashamed of myself and unable to read off my apologies (I had made a list) without crying.

My wife had asked me when I came in if I was ready to have this conversation, saying it seemed like I wasn't. I told her basically, ""This is as good as it's going to get. I'm so ashamed of myself I don't think I can do this without crying."" But I wound up kind of barking my apologies at her at breakneck speed. She said I also seemed really anxious, and I think I may have been already having a panic attack at this point without being aware.

She basically told me, ""This isn't cool. I need you to be grounded when you come in here to have this conversation. I asked you if you were ready and you said yes, but you're clearly not. You've been snapping your apologies at me."" And that was about the point at which the self-hatred seemed to basically overpower me, and I started going off on a rant saying, ""I'm such a failure and a fuck up; I STILL can't get any of this right and now I have a million NEW things I need to apologize for and given how it's gone every OTHER time I tried to apologize I'm sure I'll fuck that up too!"" When I get to this place, I usually also feel like the whole world is ending.

She told me to get a grip, I said ""I'm having a panic attack right now!"" and she told me ""You need to calm the fuck down!"" at which point I flew off the handle at her for telling me to ""calm the fuck down"". ""YOU DON'T TELL SOMEONE WHO IS HAVING A PANIC ATTACK TO CALM THE FUCK DOWN! I'D THINK AS SOMEONE WITH ANXIETY CONDITIONS HERSELF YOU'D KNOW THAT!"" She was also pretty pissed off by this point, and was yelling at me to STOP and leave the room. She snapped her fingers at me when she was yelling, and I screamed at her not to literally snap at me. She replied that I had been verbally snapping at her for a long time and I ""don't get to tell her what to do right now."" 

Well at this point, I decide I'm terrified of her for telling me to calm the fuck down, defending the fact that she said it, and now telling me I don't get to tell her what to do. I storm out and close the door to the bedroom. She yells at me not to slam the door, then calls my phone, and I answer just to tell her ""I'm scared of you right now"" and immediately hang up. She comes out into the living room and I freak out and run onto the balcony. At this point I can hear her saying, ""You need help!"" from inside. I went back in and reiterate that I'm scared of her right now, and she says she's scared of me right now, too. 

We basically yelled at each other for a while; I was really on her case about telling me to ""calm the fuck down"" and snapping her fingers at me and she was telling me to STOP, to leave her alone, and that the way I had acted was completely unacceptable. We talked over each other a lot, and honestly this part of the fight is kind of hazy for me because I was starting to realize I had gotten wrapped up in a self-hatred fueled panic attack and turned the anger outwards toward my wife -- it felt like I was coming out of a fog. I later realized I had already been having a panic attack when I tried reading off my list of apologies, and she was totally right that I needed to have taken more time to ground myself before trying to apologize.

Now, it's about 3 hours since that part of the fight ended. She has asked for space, and I've been taking it, though we have been texting some (she's in the bedroom, I'm in the living room). I know I need to make another round of apologies, and I honestly don't even know how to begin to cover everything that I know I must have said -- but she wants (and deserves) a complete apology from me.

TL;DR: I let my self-hatred sabotage my attempts at apologizing to my wife when I've made a mistake, and often end up making WAY more mistakes as a result and we end up in unnecessary, long, drawn-out fights which leave her feeling drained and alone, and me feeling drained and totally incompetent as an adult, which only tends to add fuel to the fire for my next self-hating episode. My self-hatred can turn into outright panic attacks.

Anyone else who has experience with this sort of thing: how do I get better at managing my self-hatred? What can I do to help myself make better choices when I'm in a situation where I've already made a mistake I need to apologize for, so I don't end up making everything worse?

I just turned 18, about to start at a great university, I have everything I want and a solid career plan and everything, and I don't even feel bad about anything on a day to day basis. I'm just concerned because in the last few months nothing seems to excite me anymore. I used to be big into some hobbies and really passionate about lots of stuff and to an extent I still am, but it just seems like nothing excites me anymore. I'm worried that I'm getting closer and closer to the day when I'll wake up and feel like nothing is worth doing. It's not really an existential thing or a persistent anguish, it's just a deepening boredom with life and the idea that nothing is worth spending time on.

132,"I can't remember anything. Learning has become extremely hard for me because my brain doesn't retain any information. I usually end up forgetting things a few hours after they happened. I forget everything that happens the previous day. My brain feels foggy. I can't concentrate on anything. Even watching TV is hard for me. I have no more motivation for anything anymore. I'm tired of complaining to my parents and to my doctor about how I feel. My parents just don't understand how bad I feel in my life. I don't know if this is because I try so hard to push through the problems In my life. I've been seeing a doctor and all he does is prescribe all different types of stimulants. 

And sometimes my parents want to get mad at me because I'm not doing what I'm supposed do. I'm taking medicine, going to the gym 4 times a week, and trying to do all my homework and stuff, so they see it as me being okay. Like I try so hard for no reason. 

My psychiatrist either does not understand enough or maybe he just doesn't care. I've stopped making appointments a month ago because he really isn't helping with my problems. I don't know how much more I can explain my problems to him before he can actually understand. Or maybe there just isn't a cure for the way that I feel.

I wake up in the morning, and all I can think about is how much I wish I didn't. I want to slit my wrists 3 inches deep, or OD. I feel anxious every single goddamn day of my life, and after 3 years, I've lost hope. I've written two suicide notes in the past two months, although obviously I didn't end up carrying it out. I literally don't have any way to get help, so all I can do is hope it gets better, and it fucking won't. Not on its own. But I can't trust my parents enough to tell them that I need to see someone, because last time I did, I was told I was being over dramatic and that I was exaggerating. And after yesterday's fight with my dad, where he said that I didn't have the right to be sad, or annoyed at him or my mum for the way they're treating me, and that the only people who were allowed to *feel* (yeah, he said it in those words) were him and my mum, I've completely given up. I can't trust them with anything, and I don't think I'll make it very far without someone else getting involved. But I can't tell them. I'll just get made fun of again, and I can't handle that. Fuck.

I've also been restricting food and making myself throw up for about 6 months now. I do my best to restrict how many calories I eat in a day, and on a good day I'll consume about 400-500, and on a bad day it'll go up to around 700, but when I eat too much and feel guilty, I make myself throw up too. I weigh myself every morning, which is highly triggering for me, but I feel like I need to do it, I need to know my weight so that I can lose more. I work out every single day, too. In a day, I do 1000 crunches, and run for at least an hour. It's exhausting, since I have thalassemia (which means I have less oxygen carrying protein (haemoglobin) than most people, and it makes me tired easily, and weak). I also have an iron deficiency, and have started using up the iron stores in my body, which is apparently dangerous and makes me even more tired, but I'm not taking the medication I got prescribed, because I don't trust myself not to OD on it. So anyway, I work out a lot, and every single time I finish, I feel extremely dizzy, and often faint. But I'll feel guilty if I make the workout less strenuous, so I keep on trying.

I'm in my last year of school, and I have about 4 months left, but I can't do this anymore. I've tried so hard, and I can't. My parents think I'm just lazy, but with ADHD and anxiety, and regular suicidal thoughts, as well as everything else, school is just impossible for me. I get home everyday after feeling like shit for 8 hours straight, and then I feel even worse when I have to talk to my parents, because all I feel is like I'm being judged by them. That's why I enjoy being with my friends more, my closest friends know about this, and they help without judging, but I can rely on them to just be there for a good time, too. Unfortunately, my parents aren't letting me spend much time with them, which fucking sucks, because my two best friends don't go to the same school as me, and one of them doesn't even live in the same country (we used to both live in New Zealand, but then I moved to Australia). And since they're the only people I can trust, without them, I don't even want to try to get better. I just really, really don't want to be here anymore. I'm sorry.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: I feel suicidal and am having active suicidal thoughts. I've written two suicide notes in the past two months. I can't get help because my parents tell me I'm being over dramatic. I restrict calories to 400 in a day if possible, and make myself throw up if I eat too much. The only people I can trust are my friends, but my parents won't let me talk to them much, which just makes me feel even worse.",18Jul2019,2
