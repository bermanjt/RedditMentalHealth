0,I am a 13yr old boy and every time I open up my phone I see all of my friends becoming popular people and posting these shitty things on their stories. And everything that goes on in my day and age just increases my urge to push everyone away and iscolating myself I just have no drive to do anything anymore and have lost my whole self worth I just don't leave the house anymore and I don't want to go to school I am a massive ocd freak and everything I do needs to be perfect all that happens though is the people around me wind me up and my friends become more distant and distant by the day I really do feel like no-one cares about me and have suicidal thoughts coming and going to me all the time I just really cant see how any of this is going to get better in life.,01Nov2019,1

5,"Hi, I've been thinking about this for a while, but always just shrugged it off. Anyway, I'm not sure if this is normal, but whenever I'm asked when the last time I felt joy was I find it very hard to answer, I feel like I can remember times when I'm not sad, but joy? I'm not sure, what I'm getting at is, would it be clear to me if I experienced joy or happiness? I feel similarly when asked about the last time I felt sorrow, but it seems slightly easier to think of a time, but still hard to pin down. Should I see someone or am I just being stupid?",01Nov2019,2
6,"Firstly, I'd like to apologize for the wall of text below, I just felt that saying all of that would most effectively describe my situation.

First-year Freshman in College here. I'm majoring in Electrical Engineering and taking 16 credit hours right now. This year hasn't been stupidly difficult, but I think I'm stuck in this weird mental state that's messing with my ability to perform academically to the level which I expect myself to, and making me feel depressed sort-of. I really don't understand exactly what's wrong. To start, I'm able to be happy in basically any situation regardless if I'm around people I consider friends. I've realized college is not like high school, where you're around your friends all day from the early morning until the evening, and in college, at least for me, I see these people for maybe an hour or 2 once a day twice or three times a week, which, right off the bat, messes with me socially. I'm also a commuter student, have a busy schedule, and also work on campus, which immediately may as well cripple my ability to go out and do ""college-y"" social things. To combat this slightly, I've decided I'm going to take 5 years to complete my undergrad degree in order to lighten my class load to a feasible level. I would definitely describe myself as lonely. No S/O, never had one (don't worry, I'm not an incel or anything, I've just... never had one and struggled with loneliness in the ""love"" department as well), and I've got some friends on campus, but it's just not the same. I've done a few Google searches and understand that there is a very large Freshman population in college that describe themselves as lonely and/or depressed. I find myself constantly tired, partially due to my incredibly trash sleeping schedule (which I have improved quite a bit), *constantly* introspectively-reflecting, feeling sentimental, feeling down or depressed, feeling unhappy, feeling regret about a lot of things that I did and did not do, massive feelings of FOMO, feeling neutral and lonely, daydreaming about unrealistic and ridiculous things, among other things that I can't think of at the moment. I really want my loneliness to go away, but am unsure as to how I can go about solving this. I'm really bad at initiating things with women, I won't lie. I've always been shy and kinda reserved, but I am loud and jovial around friends and people I'm comfortable with. I've been described as an extroverted introvert. I don't really have a problem with making friends, but it messes with me when I'm not able to see them very often or super inconsistently like it is for me now. As I write this right now, I feel like I've removed a plug at the bottom of a dam and all the thoughts and stuff in my head just kinda want out, so I'll do my best to keep this as coherent and non-repetitive as possible. There is a specific class, University or ""Advanced College"" Physics 1, which is honestly just kicking my ass. I've got a 91% in the class at the moment, but pulled a 73% on the most recent exam, and, just today, I had a sort-of mental crisis in the class. I tried reading my own notes and found that I couldn't understand them, or was just short-circuiting so incredibly hard that everything I had learned thus far no longer made any sense to me. I've never liked Physics (which is ironic for an engineering student) but have never been particularly horrible at it. I then spent the next 3 hours in the ""Commons"" going *all* the way back through every single section we've studied thus far in Physics and just writing down equations and some relations. My solution to a few of the loneliness problems would be to get on campus, but I don't know if that will ever be financially-achievable for me. I would also describe myself as someone who likes structure. When I have a structured, fledged out schedule in place, it can be quite hard for me to agree to go do things on a whim. This falls apart when I describe how my mind works. It's like a highway that never-doesn't have traffic, I constantly remember things and are reminded of things that I'm not proud of, regretful of, miss dearly, envy, etc. I keep a lot of this contained but it can boil over, similar to what's happening right now as I just word-vomit the issues that rear their ugly heads within my mind. I fear death, I fear the unknown, I fear what comes after death, I fear never being happy, I fear never connecting with someone and finding that special someone, I fear a lot of stuff. At this point, I'm sure there are other things I could write down here about my problems, but I think this might be most of it. This is probably stupid, but am I just fucked up in the head? I don't even know at this point. Hopefully someone here is able to make sense of all the stupid stuff I wrote here, and maybe recommend something or help me understand what's wrong with me. Sorry everyone. If anyone's read this far, thank you, you brave soul. If you stopped and just clicked away I understand. I'm going to stop writing now before it makes any less sense. Just to clarify, I have tested negative to ADHD, I have OCD, I'm pretty sure I've got anxiety issues, and negative to Autism.

8,"I cannot stress enough as to how much this community has kept me motivated to not give up on myself, please pat yourselves in your backs for that! ❤ I really love how everyone is supportive of one another, and that's what keeps me going. 
I was asked to quit gyming by my doctor around 7 months back, due to a recent biopsy, and other health concerns, until further notice. I still managed to continue on with keto, with favourable results, and a maintained body image. It all went down a crazy spiral around the beginning of September, a panic attack in the middle of the night out of nowhere is all it took for my health to deteriorate, which eventually lead to another stupid diagnosis which would compromise on my diet in general. I was asked to stop taking in proteins the next day, and fill my diet with carbs until I get better. I won't complain, I am recovering at a steady rate, but the carbs are a major setback, and I'm back to where I began, back in July 2018. It sucks, it really does. 
I can see all my work, sweat and progress go down the drain, and it really isn't comforting when people say ""you lost it once, you'll lose it again"". Like no, you don't say that to someone who can do nothing but feel bad whenever there's a mirror around, or if someone randomly asks for a selfie, and your self-conscious, zero confidence brain gets all awkward. I loved the life of being fit. I was better, physcially, mentally and my self confidence got a boost. It breaks my heart when people say things like ""man, you worked so hard, but you've put on again"". Sure, I don't owe them an explanation but why would I even go back to an unhealthy body voluntarily. I LOVED working out, the visible differences were a major esteem boost. 
All I need is get back on track, but my body won't let me. While I'm recovering from one type of trauma and getting better, there's a part of me which is growing anxious about my increasing weight day and day. 
I had come down to 76kgs (167 pounds) from 94kgs (207 pounds), and I can't get myself to make peace with it all.

10,"I’ve been frequently having emotional violent dreams—usually directed towards me. It’s to the point where I wake up breathing hard and fighting back tears. I won’t list all my dreams, but here are a few examples:

1. Dream where my dad killed my mother and he held me hostage in a car, threatening me with a knife and screaming if I wanted to die too. 
2. Dream where I had a daughter and I took her on a trip to the forest. She got lost and I frantically tried to find her. I saw an underground tunnel and went inside. There were two humanoid monsters eating her dead body and telling me how delicious she was and complimenting me like I was the chef.
3. Dream where my family were in Mexico. I was waiting in line with my brother and told him to wait in line while I check something. Went back and noticed he wasn’t there. I saw a group of people surrounding something. I went to see what they were looking at and saw my brother’s corpse laying there. His eyes and tongue were missing and it looked like he had been skinned. They told me the cartels got him and I ran around the city looking for my parents but couldn’t find them anywhere.
4. The only dream where I was violent towards someone. I moved into a wonderful condo and the neighbor greeted me. I saw him take my phone and I told him to give it back to me. He denied it was mine and began calling me horrible names. I got so angry I grabbed a picture frame and started hitting him in the head with it until he was dead. I locked myself in the bathroom and I started to hear voices telling me that they were going to kill me and that I should have been dead long ago. Suddenly a super deep voice began mocking me and telling me how scared and started groaning like an animal. 

I wouldn’t say my family is dysfunctional at all, but lately I’ve been feeling like I can’t trust them since they don’t really consider things like depression as a big deal. I think my mind is bottling up all the anger and sadness that I’m not allowed to share.",01Nov2019,1
11,"I've been confronting and dealing with some triggers of mine over the past year. I know basically where they come from. I have something like abandonment issues from early childhood- and when I feel my s/o's attention shifting somewhere else I tend to fear it's my fault and that they will leave me. I often fear that they're cheating on me too. I know this comes from a traumatic event in my past that involves infedelity. But now I don't know what to do about this. Like I know and recognize these things, I know why it happens, most of the time I can prevent myself from acting on my anxieties, can see it coming. But then what? Do I just continue to live my life waiting to get triggered again? Do I really have to deal with a brain that does the opposite of what I know to be right? Do I have to keep waiting for the next low? Do I have to keep worrying myself to exhaustion for days, weeks at a time? Unable to really focus on and enjoy my work? Unable to sit alone with myself? Sure, I can keep myself from acting on my triggers and hurting others. But I'm still hurting myself. 
I don't know what's next. I've been doing the deep diving into my past to find out why I do these things. I've been going to therapy. Working on my physical health. On my work. On socializing. On everything really. But I feel like I've hit a wall. Like I don't really put my all into anything and am just going through the motions. Like I'm not healing anymore.",01Nov2019,1

I have enough autonomy to do what I love and connect with people in the best ways I know how. I am finally loving what I do because I can be myself. It took me a long time to get that confident. 

I have a coworker who is older than my parents; and she had the nerve to say that my style of doing my job is not necessarily the best style. She has a tendency to come off condescending because she has children my age. 

But she kind of implied that my style is not the most “professional.” She’s entitled to her opinion- and guys I DID NOT SPEND THE EVENING UPSET ABOUT IT.

18,"I've always been a bit of a loner. I kept to myself a lot as a child and became even more reclusive as I developed social anxiety in adolescence. Since then I've made a lot of progress on that front, but I still don't like spending time with others and all of my favorite activities are solo. My fantasies of the future all involve solitude, probably partly because people are exhausting. It all makes me really want to live alone. 

That said, my concurent issues with depression lead me to doubt I'll ever be able to live on my own successfully. I was a very depressed suicidal mess all through college untill I finally dropped out and moved back home. Now I live at home with my family, am engaged to be wed, and my depression feels like a thing of the past. However, I deeply miss my solitude. I know I don't have the will power to live on my own and not engage in destructive behavior that'll lead to depression again, so I feel I've resigned myself to getting married and having friends and stuff (I need accountability to do things, I struggle with self care when the thought of disappointing a love one isn't on the line.).

20,"Hi, I'm 22 years old

I always feel so weak when I have even the thought wanting to share my problems with anyone I trust. 

When I was around 4, my dad and mom divorced (still dont know why, always been too afraid to ask, I just dont want to because I dont want my mom to relive any memories if any were really painful during that time) 

I didnt have much affection growing up because when she was single at the time, my mom would always be at work while my grandma took care of me most of the time (I'm thankful for my moms hardwork and my grandma taking care of me)

I liked the elementary school I went to because of all the friendships I built since kindergarten but I had to move in 3rd grade, which left me feeling very lost and I didnt want to do the whole friends thing over again, so I kept to myself and waited patiently till I graduated high school (made a few acquaintances but still no one I really trusted my feelings with)

I go to church, and have made a community of friends there and at the college I go to now but I still refuse to open up about my feelings ever (not that I dont like my friends) I just dont want to appear weak because I've been weak all my life.

During high school, 2 people very close to me died and it did destroy me, but like with every other thoughts and problems I had, I still just kept everything to myself and tried to solve everything myself.

And because of all this I have self confidence problems, I have silent anger issues, I cant concentrate, affection confuses me, I dont have motivation to do anything but I still try to get through college just to please my mom because I love her and I owe her everything. I just hate everything about everything. I just want to disappear or hope I wake up from this 'dream' and I am someone else with a normal life.  And I'm so FUCKING awkward I hate it. 

Suicide has always been fluttering in my head past year now and that stupid negative voice in my head is so annoying. But I guess I will never kill myself because i just have a grain of faith still that life will get better but i just dont know when it fucking will. 

Once again, hello I'm 22 years old and I want someone to help me learn how to approach to share my feelings with the people I love. Because I still cant do it, thankyou for reading.

PS: I apologize if nothing makes sense because this is the first time I typed/written my problems down. I still have a lot of problems and worries I haven't written down but these are the main ones that have affected me growing up and shaped the piece of shit I am today.",01Nov2019,2
21,"I've been thinking if I should post this or not. I guess little bit of venting won't hurt me, and I have no one else to talk to so here it goes...

I think I haven't felt worse than I am feeling right now in my whole life. I feel like I'm going crazy, something inside my head is just not right. I don't know if this is that kind of ""depression"" every teenager has at some point but what I do know is that ever since she left me my life's been going downhill. 

I must be one of the luckiest guys on earth, I have a nice house and a family that loves and supports me. I'm doing really good at highschool and have a lot of projects in mind. Money has never been a problem neither, not even now when our country's having a hard time. Having all of this is way much more than a lot of people could wish, and it makes me feel like I shouldn't be sad, that I have no right to feel bad at all. But I just can't bear with it, I'm not happy anymore if I ever was. 

It's so awful. This mixture of emotions I feel every day, especially every night is just terrible. It's become unbearable. Every time I start to feel better it comes back and hits me even harder. I can't describe how it feels, not only because English is not my main language, it's just something I've never felt before. It's in my head, it doesn't hurt but feels uncomfortable, makes me feel tired and even bewildered at any time.

If I had to list all my problems, I'd start saying that I'm really insecure of myself. My self-esteem was never that good, but lately it has just got worse. I can't stop feeling anxious and judged by everyone. And when I say everyone I also mean my friends.

I don't feel comfortable anymore with them, it's not their fault it's just me. They're great people, I'm the problem. I feel like I'm starting to envy them, their lives, everything seems better than mine. Today I realized I can't bear with them being happy, and that sickened me. How did I ever get to this point? 

I wish I could tell them all my problems, posting this here was my last option. But the reason I don't wanna talk to them is that I'm really bad at talking about myself and I'm afraid of what they might think of me. I'm scared of getting to close to someone, and I wish I could get as close as I wanted to someone but I can't. Something about me won't let it happen

And as if wasn't enough, I'm terribly anxious when in social situations. It's so hard to me to make new friends, to meet new people, that's why I was so obsessed with her. She loved me the way I was.

I feel so lonely. I've been feeling so lonely since she left me. It's not that I still miss her or feel bad because of her, not anymore. As I said, everything has been going downhill since then and I think it's because I realized what kind of person I am. If I look back at the things I said and thought when she was with me it makes me wanna punch myself. I've been judging myself ever since, and not because I had anything to do with her breaking up. It's just I realized how inferior I feel to everyone else.

The reason why I'm desperate is because I cant stand this anymore. I want things to be like when I was with her. I'm still the same guy, nothing has changed in me, but then I didn't know how insecure I am for some reason. I was busy being happy, feeling loved (in a different way) for the first time in my life. I miss so much that feeling, you can't imagine how. Everything was so much easier.

I can't go back to those days and I can't change myself, so it seems like I'm not gonna be happy anymore for a long time. That has lead me to think it's senseless to live like this. Having all the nice things I have is just a waste, it's like I don't deserve it. I would change every single thing for any of my friends life. 

I would never try to kill myself, but now I can see why there's people that sees suicide as the only outcome. It's not. My problems are nothing compared to what some other people has to get through, but I can tell suicide is not the answer to anyone. 

I know I can be happy again, that I won't need to hide all of this from my family anymore and that I will change at some point, no matter how much pain I have to go through. But I do need help. I can't do this alone and that's why I'm desperate, because no one can help me and I don't wanna live anymore, not in this way.",01Nov2019,1
22,"Hi guys a bit of a loaded topic. My best friend tried to commit suicide 2 days ago and failed. His parents don't know and it didn't have much repercussions physically, I got him to talk it out at my house and he was fine but was still depressed. Next day, he was normal at school but was still quite depressed. I felt really off and sad. After school I broke down and cried, for the past year he's been saying how depressed he's been and my other friend and i have been trying to get him help. He was still depressed, but he acted normal. But I couldn't. I broke down and started crying after school. I don't know why. It was dramatic. He was as close as a brother.

23,"Let me start by saying I'm not suicidal. I'm just going through a rough time and need to try to get my head straight.
Two years ago, I moved across the country with my best friend and her friend. I was excited, enthusiastic at the idea of us spending time together all the time, without time zones interfering.
It's been a lot of arguing in the meantime. I'm an only child and I have no idea how to express my thoughts and emotions in a conflicting situation. I just shut down and stay silent, because it's always been the ""correct"" thing to do growing up. I don't think to speak my mind, because I just don't DO that. And it's caused so much fighting.
I've tried to work through my thoughts when I shut down, but it's not easy. I literally can't think sometimes when it happens, no matter how hard I try to focus on giving an answer. And because I struggle to tell my best friend of a decade what I'm thinking and feeling, she gets even more frustrated with me. Like I don't trust her or something, when I've tried to tell her it's literally something that has always been an issue for me.
The last few weeks, I've felt this crushing dread and worthlessness. Like no matter what I do, I'm just making everyone around me upset. I have tried to change my behavior, but I'm also so mentally and emotionally exhausted that I just don't have the energy to keep trying to argue/explain my side of things so we can come to an understanding. Which just aggravates the situation, because she has said multiple times she feels like I'm treating her like I'm a kid and she's an angry adult.
I don't know what I'm trying to ask for from y'all, honestly. I'm just so tired of arguing, of feeling incompetent no matter what I try to do or say, of not being good enough for us to all have a day without fighting. I have wondered a lot about if I just had never existed, but again I don't plan on hurting myself.",01Nov2019,1
24,"Rambling full speed ahead...

I am a 26 year old female, and I've tried seeking professional help several times over the years with no solution...I believe I went to my first therapist in my pre-teen years, or it could've been before then, I don't know because my memory seems so skewed (took various drugs and drank alcohol for a good 8 years or so). Was never addicted to anything but cigarettes though. 

I feel insane and I need somebody that can relate or give me some kind of **real** outside perspective... maybe even advice. This will be poorly written and I **am** going to sound like a crappy person but please note that I recognize it and want to change.

1) I know I have depression. There is literally nothing that I enjoy doing more than just laying in bed, isolated from the world. I would lay in bed all weekend if it weren't for my loving boyfriend, who I believe I treat like shit. I don't have sex with him, I don't care about his hobbies and I accuse him of a lot of things. He points out that I always think negatively of him, when in reality I know he is a good person and I recognize that I do these things. I don't always recognize it immediately though, and in hindsight, it really takes him pointing it out, me getting unnaturally irritated at him pointing it out even if I'm in the wrong, and then I tell him to leave me alone until I get some kind of lovey dovey high later on and come yearning for his love again... he knows that there is something wrong with me but he stays.

2) I think of death/suicide every day but I wouldn't do it at this point in time, because I couldn't leave my mother behind like that. I do think that I would strongly consider it once she is gone. 

3) I do not feel normal living day to day, I do not have any hobbies or have any interest in anything, except for eating. We do fun things like go to concerts or snowboarding sometimes though. If I didn't have a boyfriend to push me to do things, I'd just go to work and sleep everyday. 

I am able to hold a job and I believe I excel at whatever I do. I have thoughts going through my mind that my co-workers are idiots, even though they may be the nicest person and are always helping me, AND have been doing it for longer than I have. I always strive to be better than them and I have feelings that I actually AM better than them... regardless, I always act extremely nice and I don't believe I ever show that side, but it feels so fake to me. I feel like the other person can sense that I don't feel the way I am acting (whether they actually do or not, I don't know) and thus I begin to feel awkward/anxious. I feel more awkward/anxious at work with colleagues than anywhere else. I am fine at a party, bar, grocery store, anywhere else.

4) You may have already guessed this, but I do not have anyone that I can call a friend except for my boyfriend. I've pushed anyone who hasn't wronged me at all away by never replying to their texts/calls at some point. The last friend that I had, we got into a huge fight over something while we were drunk and I basically tore her down with every little thing she has ever done wrong. It was so bad but at that point in time I felt like I was ready to end the friendship anyway as she got on my nerves all the time. I did feel bad about it afterwards, but I'm mostly kicking myself because I burned a bridge with someone that I could've used to move into different careers. I am more concerned with how she will portray me to others as well... 

I feel like I see a pattern in myself after re-reading, where I will feel a certain way about something but then again I also feel a totally opposite way. I go through everyday the best that I can and then I get home and reflect on how crappy of a person I am because I know what I'm thinking internally, whether it be self loathing or general annoyance with other people, and things that I did wrong, and how I portrayed myself to everyone today. I tend to think to myself a lot... was I *real* enough? 

I don't even feel like I know who the real me is.",01Nov2019,1
25,"My dad had it. And it's correlated with genetics. So ...

I've been having a really hard time lately. Like I've been almost agoraphobic in my lifestyle and basically depressed for years. 
I live at home with my mom and step-dad for the last 6 years. I'm 36 and just started trying to get my life on track. 
It's really hard. I've been getting anxiety attacks so bad I went to the doctor thinking something must be physically wrong with me. I just pulled up my blood tests online and they are all normal. 
So it's all mental. I started taking Effexor (generic) 37.5mg for the last 5 days and today I started taking it twice a day, so 75mg a day.
I'm really hoping it starts helping me feel something better. (Anyone have experience with Effexor?)

Anyway I just looked at BPD and I have several of the symptoms (although I don't get angry, like my dad did.) I just have a crippling fear of being alone and a super-low self-esteem and mood swings and it's scary to think that I could have BPD.

I just got a job doing seasonal retail at JCPenneys and it's almost too much to handles (I rally rushed into getting my life back in track and I think it's backfiring.

Anyway, anxiety, stress and worrying about what could be wrong with me. Combined with being 36 and having virtually no prospect in life has made me think about suicide . Not like I want to , or I think I would, but it's like I can't see a positive way toward a better me or a better life . 

I'm seriously thinking of quitting the job I just got a few days ago. And focusing on my mental health, but even though that seems like the best option For me , it doesn't seem like a clear path towars being better...

I'm just worried and concerned and overwhelmed....",01Nov2019,1
26,"So I made an account just to ask advice for this. I’ve been struggling with my mental health for awhile but, the one thing I’m confused on is this thing I do called “dancing”

This “dancing” isn’t really dancing, it’s me listening to music on my bed rocking back n forth. While doing this I sort of day dream to the point that it seems real. Kind of like lucid dreaming while awake. Blocking out the real environment. Ive been doing this since I was in middle school

What concerns me is I can’t go a day without doing it. I do it every couple of hours for half an hour at least. I get antsy when I don’t do it. In fact I would cry if I can’t do it for a day. Even on vacation I will do it and sometimes I leave early when hanging out with my friends to go do it.

It just shows that no matter how much you give, no matter how much you do, no matter how much you put others before yourself, that in the end that's all overlooked and that one thing you did is the factor that you're looked down upon, or people just jump to the worst conclusions about you. 


That basically all the good and the positive is all torn down because of one error, one missjudgement, one mistake. That regardless of all the good, positive things you do that they cant rationalize a situation where you were just trying to do good and made a misjudgment, or that what you did was learned behaviour from past experiences and you were just trying to self-protect. 


I just am exhausted, tired of trying to please everyone and be there for everyone, when in the end no ones there for me. To instead of getting angry or pissed off show understanding or even ask for a reason why without being demeaning or judgemental.


I think I'm just done with people. Time to delete snapchat, leave Facebook, and various other social media platforms and just cease to exist except to the people who actually do care about me. I've given up my faith in seeing the best in people.

I used to be super numb and all, but it’s like I’ve made a fake persona (once again not “deep” but for real it’s like Patrick Bateman but with remorse). It’s like every time I talk to someone or do something, I feel massively disgusting, like it isn’t me because it isn’t but I am nothing for real. Everything else then feels fake. I get sad, I laugh, I hate life, I am fucked it’s weird. Why can’t I be classically “sad-happy” I got diagnosed with anxiety and got tested for Bipolar (They said no) but it’s like, how can a anxious person just get moments when I’m on top of the world and am fucking brutal, to then feel like nothing.

But I have this massive fantasy that I’ll become successful and famous and I say it’s not true but I kinda know I’m lying, I will because I will kill myself. I’m crazy like that.

I have a massive porn addiction. I like to cling to people because it pisses me off that they might end up hating me so I ask like every 30 minutes “why do you hate me” it’s like a ritual. I get mad fast but don’t act on it. It’s feel like holding two magnets with the same poles together. I owe loads of people money for impulses trying to get alcohol when I don’t have money, or cigarettes or a new vape or just binging delivery when I just don’t want to spend money like that. I don’t hallucinate but I think I see things when I’m scared, like a person or hearing sounds out of nowhere for split seconds. I constantly think that someone I barely know has a special connection with my because they may glare at me by coincidence (luckily my self-esteem kinda gives me a reality check).

32," As an international student from Asia, I have been fighting against it for a very long time. When I started my bachelor degree in the US at the age of 18, I easily got lost. It was very tough for me to get used to the new environment and culture. Plus, language was a big issue for someone like me who merely passed the TOEFL test. I am a quiet guy and like to stay alone. I was scared of everything there because I don't know how to deal with all of them and did not really have any friends and support. I stopped going to class and failed all of them. I finally sought help after I was told about the decision of suspension. I was diagnosed with depression, stayed in hospital for weeks and took medications. Then everything seemed back to normal after I got out. I made some good friend and gain very nice grades in my courses. But when it comes to my third year of study, my parents wanted me to apply for a master degree, and they did not know my previous health condition. I wasn't really ready for this upcoming big decision. I was scared of showing my past to schools and others. I didn't know how to explain to my family so I escaped from reality again. This time, it hurt me greater and I spent 2 years wasting time on lying and escaping, But I have to face the truth and tell my family everything. It should've been only a year left if I didn't take the step back but in fact, it cost me 3 more years. My parents forgave me, I know they were really disappointed, but they cared about me more. I was feeling extremely guilty for letting them down. I met with counsellors and psychologists many times and finally with my mom's accompany with me for my last semester, I was able to graduate. I thought the nightmare was over. I returned to my home country and found a job in the biggest city. It wasn't a very bad job but it did not have any future expectations. I feel like a bachelor degree isn't enough for the cost of living in a big city, and I couldn't even gain back the investment my parents put on me. Studying abroad is a huge expense. Hence, the whole family decided to send me to Australia for a master degree. And the nightmare came back. Every time I tried to look retrospectively, it made me irritated and anxious. I am always thinking that I was a failure in the past, and I won't be able to succeed in the future. The cost of living I mentioned above keeps pushing me back. And I failed/withdraw a lot of courses again. I really don't know how to get over it.",01Nov2019,1

35,"My life has had a lot of ups and downs. I'd like to start off by saying that I go to a military academy, so I guess my college experience has been unique. I'm also very new to reddit if that's anything.

 2 years ago I was put in a psych ward for mental health evaluation for a week. They said I had social anxiety disorder. The next year was absolutely awful. I couldn't connect with anyone. I just wanted to be alone. I slept so much and I am blessed that I wasn't kicked out. I was just a slave to the medicine.

 Fast forward to now, off the medication and life seems to be good. I have friends, I'm performing well in my sport ( I do gymnastics) and grades are good. 

But something still seems wrong. I'm pretty busy most of the time but when I'm alone and I have time to think I keep telling myself that everything seems good, but something feels wrong. I still feel very lonely after my last relationship but I cant stand the idea of dating other people. She still calls me when things are wrong in her life or if she needs money despite being engaged to some E-3 in the Army. I don't get why she still talks to me. Also, I feel like the friends around me are good people but in general do not have any interest in me. Don't get me wrong, they care about my well being, but they don't care about ME of that makes sense. I feel out of place. I feel like I don't belong here,but I've been here for over 3 years. 

All of these problems are internal, but I feel like I should be happy. I'm not an addict. I don't smoke and I barely drink. The closest things I have to an addiction are music and (more sad to say) pornography. I'm an average student trying to become a military officer. I'm single but that's by choice. I'm not even badlooking; quite athletic actually.

38,"So when I was in middle school I cried a lot from 2nd till 5th grade which made me have trouble getting friends but we'll get to that later. Generally I cried because any little thing would get me extremely stressed and the only way to vent that was through crying. My parents sent me to a phyciatrist around 4th grade and they said I had adhd and I could take drugs to stop it. I didn't take the drugs. Then a week before my 8th grade graduation my parents got divorced. Now you could see this going into me getting stressed again but thats not what happened, I just stopped feeling really anything in the way of anything for freshmen year of highschool. I pretty much stopped having emotions and when I did it was very small. In sophmore year I was feeling better, I had friends , and I was pretty happy. Then something kind of weird happened on a show choir trip to L.A. which included a trip to disney land. We were there all day and towards the end of it I somehow got seperated from my friends. I knew where they were going and never thought that they would care where I was so I didn't text them or check my phone and went to where we were going. When I got there and they weren't there I checked my phone and they were texting where was I and that they were worried about me. I had honestly thought that my friends didn't care about me or would really care if I was just gone. I don't know why I thought this but I did.

40,"Hey everyone, I've been scoping and creeping on Reddit for a few years now and I made my account tonight because i don't trust anyone i know personally to be able to actually help guide me or at least give me advice that has no biased opinion based on knowing me personally. Forgive any grammar issues, i am on mobile and barely graduated highschool.

All that said, I'm not sure what to do about my life, I've been battling depression for years, i come from a meth house, most of my family are of that disposition. I have had several failed relationships and am in the midst of another. However my issue stems from a previous relationship that i feel has been poisoning my views of everything since. I was planning to propose to this woman, however after two years of dating, and living together for 18months she ended it. This isn't a pity party for me, i understand why she did it, I'm, quite frankly, an asshole so i understand. However what i couldn't and still can't understand is why i was lied to after. Within a week of leaving me she started sleeping with someone new while still living with me. When i discovered the truth nearly a month later i became unhinged. I pulled everything she owned out of the house and started stacking it on the front lawn and porch. I will admit, not my proudest moment and truthfully one of my most regretted moments in my life so far. Over the next two week's i started drinking for the first time ever and in a blacked out state i apparantly attempted to end my own life. The truly abhorrent part of that was that she was in the home when i made my attempt. Afterwards we had the last real conversation where i told her i couldn't be involved in her life if we couldn't be together, because of my own selfishness being just friends or anything less than together wasn't an option so i removed myself from hers and as many mutual associates lives as possible.

I do not have current desires for self harm or suicide. However I cannot stop thinking about her nearly every second of every day. It's been over two years and i still can't turn that part of my brain off. Now i know that professional help is generally the best route to take for this kind of issue. But my biggest aide and stress reliever my entire life has been shooting. If i go to seek professional help I don't want that taken from me.

At the end of the day i guess my question is, what should i do? Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? Am i alone in my feelings? Am i just the selfish self centered asshole i believe i am or is there more to it i don't understand? 

Any help and advice is appreciated, and thank you to anyone who made it through this jumbled mess of sentences.",01Nov2019,1

49,"You might be depressed right now.

That’s a terrible feeling. 

I totally know that because I’m no stranger to that.

I might feel depressed at times, but you know what? 

I don’t let myself stay there.

Here's my method for dealing with depression naturally.

If you prefer to hear me talk about it in my podcast, here you go:
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzm471i7Qk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNzm471i7Qk)

&amp;#x200B;

The concept of engaging our emotions for dealing with depression naturally

To fight depression effectively, we need to realize that it’s just a feeling after all.

We have all sorts of emotions during the day.

Depression is just one of them, even though it’s a powerful one.

Tim Matthews, the founder of The Powerful Man, gives one good example of how we create it:

&gt;“When we start to think that we should be farther ahead than who and where we are now, we begin to feel so much pressure which can lead to depression.”

Even if we feel depressed, we can switch to another emotion instantly.

For example, I feel love whenever I give a hug to my kid.

Which means I can switch to that emotion voluntarily.

My current emotion is the one that I choose to feel by focusing on it.

Tony Robbins has this concept called the Triad.

Changing our feeling requires changing the following three things: 

1. physiology: posture and breathing
2. focus: what we think about
3. language: what we say to ourselves when we think about it

Here I am talking about the second part: *focus*.

Let me show how I replace a negative emotion with a positive one using my focus.

**Step #1: Have a memory associated with a strong positive emotion**

I have this memory of feeling like a winner.

A few years ago, I went to a park on a date with a girl.

We took a walk for about an hour.

When we returned to my car, I pushed the button on the door to unlock it.

But it wouldn’t unlock.

I was confused because my key was supposed to be in my pocket and the car was supposed to unlock.

But what if I didn’t have the key?

I looked around for the key but it was nowhere to be found.

I lost it indeed.

So I called a taxi to take the girl home and grab the second key from my home.

In the morning, I decided to go look for the key.

I thought that would be a waste of time.

I mean what are the chances to find the key in a huge park where we walked a lot.

But somehow I trusted my intuition.

I drove back to the park and started following our yesterday’s path.

I was 100% sure I had no chance.

A large park, high grass, and a small key.

And sure enough, there it was, lying in the grass, waiting for me.

Man, this looked like a miracle.

I felt ecstatic for so many reasons.

I don’t like to lose things and I avoided losing the key.

It was quite expensive to restore and I didn’t want the hassle.

And most importantly, I couldn’t believe that I actually found it.

It might not sound like a big deal to you.

But it doesn’t matter!

What does matter is that for me it was a miracle.

I couldn’t believe it.

And I committed this feeling to memory.

**Step #2: Rely on this memory to recall the emotion**

Now I use this memory as a go-to place for things like winter depression or any other negative thoughts really.

See, I noticed that it could help me just a couple of days after finding the key.

I was running and really pushing myself.

It felt hard, but then I suddenly remembered about the key.

And running felt less difficult instantly.

So I said to myself:

“If I can use this memory to change my state when I run, how about other situations?”

So the next time I felt depressed, I replayed that memory.

I recreated the entire experience in my mind as vividly as possible.

Summer park smells.

Sounds of the wind in the trees.

How the morning sun felt on my skin.

How I noticed the key.

The unbelievable feeling of victory.

The gratitude about trusting my intuition.

And feeling happy telling the girl that I found it.

Replaying that memory took me about two minutes.

And it was already worthwhile because at least in those few minutes, I didn’t feel depressed.

I felt elated.

But it didn’t really last just two minutes.

In fact, I stayed elated.

And I would keep reminding myself of the key from time to time.

That was enough to renew my focus.

And whenever I felt depression coming back strong, I replayed the entire experience again for a stronger effect.

That's it: dealing with depression naturally is that easy!

**Step #3: Keep programming yourself**

As I kept using this memory, it worked even more effectively.

The idea is to make it so habitual that it happens automatically.

In fact, we do it with negative emotions all the time.

We keep thinking of something bad and we feel depressed.

That’s because our mind is focused on survival and keeps looking for what is wrong.

But if we can train ourselves to feel negative emotions, we can do the same with the positive ones!

It just takes more practice and patience.

As we practice shifting from negative to positive emotions, we program them into our subconscious mind.

And eventually, we are able to call those positive emotions just as quickly as the negative ones.

Start dealing with depression naturally today

**Conclusion**

There you go: there is no reason for living with depression when it’s just a matter of focus.

Instead of focusing on what’s bad in your life, you have the power to focus on a positive emotion.

Find a memory when you felt elated. It doesn’t have to be as big as winning a Nobel prize. What matters is how excited you felt at the moment.

Replay that moment in your mind in detail so that you feel the positive emotions in your body.

And then keep focusing on those positive emotions to avoid the negative ones.

When you feel that the negative emotions start creeping back in, replay the moment in detail again.",01Nov2019,0
50,"So I've been getting severely depressed after I ended a recent relationship. I've had trouble opening up in the past, due to toxic relationships, abuse, manipulative friends, the fun stuff. After I opened up to this person, I finally felt safe, I felt like I had nothing to fear and that I could open up to someone. Until after nearing a year of our relationship, things started to change. My partner got mad at me for having an anxiety attack. I was panicking because I was going to have Thanksgiving with her family, and no one's family has ever liked me, since I'm pretty quiet and shy around adults (I'm 18) since then, she started to antagonize me, starts fights over little things, make me feel like I did something wrong, make fun of me for the things I liked, etc. After I defided that it was time to end our relationship, I wanted to try to stay friends, but she said she wants me out of her life. If you need to know, I gave this girl my virginity, and it meant a lot to me (go to hell if you're laughing) and ever since that, I feel like I can't trust anyone or even open up to new people. I'm isolated in my house everyday, I'm having random breakdowns, questioning my own worth, and feel anxious in public. I'm questioning if I need real help, or if this is all in my head",01Nov2019,1
51,"Hello all,

First post here. 

I've suffered from anxiety and depression most of my life and believe I am just now starting to understand why.

Growing up nothing I did was ever enough. Straight A student, decked out at graduation, always trying to be the best at everything because no matter how much I did my single mom viewed it as ""Great, but can you do better?"" 

In many ways I am grateful because it has made me successful as an adult, but in other ways it has made my success feel... Insufficient.

I now realize that I've lived most of my life satisfying others demands, but in trying to find myself I have realized I have no idea who I really am. I've begun to doubt everything I believe.

I know there's nobody who can answer this burning question inside, but have any of you been through this? Or am I going crazy?",01Nov2019,2

54,"This is an emotional approach I am considering. 

Personality disorders all revolve around unhealthy coping mechanisms for feeling rejected, or worthless, or deprioritized, etc. Each disorder is essentially a group of coping mechanisms that usually work together. But all of them have the same core issue: fear of the pain of rejection.

The first step to move towards healthy coping mechanisms is to assert your own self worth to yourself. When you judge yourself as a whole, or part, or situation, you see worth there.

Ok, so, I'm looking at a theoretical step two: accepting rejection from others as is. Not avoiding thinking about it, not talking myself into believing they're incorrect to reject me, not humbling myself about my behaviors that caused me to be rejected, but to merely face head on the fact that I have been rejected. Face it, and accept it without judgment.

Having internal confidence in oneself is very crucial. But we cannot forget that the ties between ourself and others is also an important factor in our mental health. We are social creatures by nature. We have a fear of rejection built into ourselves precisely so that we work together as a cohesive whole. So those individual ties between one person and another will have an impact upon ourselves. We can't rationalize that away.

So. A person has rejected me. I wanted them to see more of me, and accept me as I am, yet, when they saw me it caused them to ultimately decide to rejected me. How do I simply accept that as a fact without judgment? How do I do this without rationalizing it away?

It's a new thing I would like to try. I can't quite find resources around it, because it is all about building one's own sense of self worth with themselves. I have achieved secure confidence in my own positive judgment of myself. But I am still greatly hurt at a negative judgment of me from others, now and in the far past.

Let's take a specific painful situation from my past. As an employee, I had massive problems as well as massive value. Another employee was *perceived* as having small problems and massive value, but in reality he had massive problems and negative value. I warned others about his true nature, but because of the negative judgment of me, they disbelieved me.

Then the relationship between he and I blew up because of his massive problems. But again, the others didn't see his massive problems, only mine, so they believed I was even further of a problem adding more to the perception of my massive problems. There is an event where he severely traumatized me with an abusive tactic, and the others punished me for being loudly upset at his behavior towards me.

It came down to between him or me (he demanded they choose), and they chose him. It is without question that when I was judged between him and I, I was judged to be worth less.

I still sternly believe that despite my massive problems, my massive value outweighed them. My predictions came through based upon my judgment of him; his massive problems and negative value cause everything to be lost after I was fired.

I was not perfect. I had massive problems. I accept this. And yet, I am incredibly hurt that those problems caused me to be rejected. I wanted the *whole* of me to be weighed, but it wasn't. And it hurts like a motherfucker.

How can I learn how to sit with situations like this? To accept without judgment that when I was measured I was deemed to be worth less.",01Nov2019,1

59,"Hello everyone,

Here's a little background on my situation:  when I was around 19 years old, I was going through some depression and sought the help from a therapist.  I had never seen one before, but I immediately clicked with her.  I was a really insecure, depressed, sheltered person when I met her, but she helped me through so much of that.  I continued seeing her weekly for the next 11 years, all because I felt a bond with her.  Her office was always my refuge.  

I eventually moved out of state and obviously couldn't see her anymore.  She kept in touch for about a year and a half via email after I moved out.  She was always very caring.  She would always email me asking if I'm okay, and get worried if I didn't respond within a time-frame.  This was how she was throughout the decade that I knew her.  I'm not bragging, but I could tell she really cared about me, and that really helped me through many dark times.

Eventually, she just randomly stopped emailing me.  The last email I had sent her was nothing out of the ordinary.  The email I responded to seemed ordinary as well.  We were simply talking about a job that I had taken and a trip I had gotten back from.  Then she never responded to it.  I stupidly thought that she was mad at me.  There was an email a month ago where I discussed a sensitive political subject, and she kind of ignored it...and I had assumed that her not responding anymore was because she could no longer tolerate talking to me.  This was about almost 2 years ago. 

I know I should be over it, but I think about her a lot.  Looking back, I feel like an idiot for never having reached out and asking her if everything is okay.  After a few months, it felt like it was too late.  I worry about her.  I have no idea if she's okay or how she's doing.  At the very least, I just want to know that she's alright.  Would it be wrong to reach out to her?  It just seems like it would be inappropriate and that I might get a negative response (or none).  It's not even about trying to get an ongoing correspondence with her...it's just me wanting to know that, wherever she is, that she's doing alright.

60,"Hey reddit,

This is actually my first ever post on reddit, I feel obliged to call this a **""throw away""** account, but this is also my first account and stuff, so I don't think it works like that.

Anyway to cut to the chase I've been dealing with what I assume is an inferiority complex for as long as I could remember. It initially culminated sometime in my preteen years and has gotten to the point wherein I feel like my day-to-day life is being majorly affected by this issue, and I'm worried it'll only get worse as the years go by, which is a scary thought to say the least!

I'm currently in a loving relationship, and I would say I suppose I'm doing well academically since I'm in my final year of a university course in a subject that I'm deeply passionate about. However, I always feel as though I barely amount to anything. That - of all the people in the world - I'm well and truly unremarkable. This is pretty often reflected in my relationship as I often need to console in my partner for reassurance and comfort, however this only helps so much, as not even my own relationships are really ""safe"" from my inferiority complex. 

To put it into perspective; whenever you're told you're loved, the natural response is to be rather happy and (more often than not) reciprocate those feelings, as well as somewhat believe the claim that you're loved. I reciprocate the feeling, sure, because I enjoy making others feel better. However, soon after I'm left with a cold, doubtful outlook on the situation, and I quickly begin questioning ""Why me? Why am **I** deserving of being loved? It makes no sense."" It's a slippery slope, because by just thinking that, I soon enter a state of self-hatred/loathing, simply because I feel like an asshole for disregarding peoples' feelings about me. I feel like I owe it to others to be happy whenever they compliment me or reassure me that I'm loved. So whenever my inferiority complex kicks in, I end up feeling a deep sense of self-hatred shortly after.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not hopeless on the matter, but just...God, it **really** sucks. Like, I just want to one day hear my partner tell me he loves me, only to smile, **genuinely believe what he said**, and tell him that I love him back. But it's just so incredibly difficult to do so.",01Nov2019,5

67,"Hi, 
Recently I've come to understand that a large group of people in my town most likely believe that I'm a stalker. I'm so incredibly ashamed of this. I'm a petite female (not a physical threat). I'm a foreign student and have few friends in town so there aren't many that can speak in my defence. 
There was a particular person, a guy in his 40s (?), that I kept running  into so many times, in ways that seemed odd to me. I saw this as unusual coincidences. Allthough,  it was not too strange,  as I lived only 30 seconds away from where he was working. I had just recently moved there after an Erasmus term abroad.  At one point I had bought an item from him in a shop and we chatted for a bit.  After that I often saw him but I mostly looked away. Because,  I didn't want to appear flirty. This plan failed. A couple of times I accidentally ended up exactly where he was and we stood and looked at eachother quietly. He seemed friendly.  Though I was hoping that he didn't think I was responsible for engineering these meetings. They could have been, but they were freak coincidences.  However.  Because I continued to see him so often, I became intrigued. Eventually I once asked him if he would like to have tea with me some day. He said yes and that he'd love to,  allthough he has a girlfriend,  but just having tea would be nice. We chatted in the street when we'd run into eachother a few times. All in all perhaps 10 times. We never had tea. I only asked once and didn't want to cause trouble. One time I popped over to his shop for a chat but he seemed very irritated with me,  so I wished him well and left and kept away from the area for 3 months straight, by trying to walk different routes behind my house to avoid him,  because at this point his social circle had began to act as if I'm a potentially criminal, dangerous  or crazy person. Whispering and shaking their heads every time they saw me grocery shopping or walking down the street. One person tried to tackle me ""subtly"" in a cafe,  and when I tried to order a coffee he wouldn't serve me at first,  he just made a face at me, but then had to succumb to his profession and make me a coffee. 
A few months later I decided to stop hiding and walk out in the open like normal people do. After 1 minute I spot the guy walking towards me. He stops to speak to me and we have a chat for 15 minutes or so. He's always very friendly,  asks me polite questions and we chat about life. Often about personal issues. We say goodbye. I don't see him for another 3 months because I have become afraid of his friends and I'm again avoiding the main street. I'm thinking that I wish I could be just friends with him, just like he's friends with so many other people. Chatting to everyone, being very friendly and kind. I had 6 months earlier brushed off any idea of being anything other than friends or just acquainted. I'm not seeking to date this person. But I feel that he's one of the few people I've ever felt connected to. That's why I wish we could be actual friends or on good terms,  at least. I don't mean that I don't meet other people. I do. It's just that it's so unusual to click with someone, and I have felt that we easily understand eachother. However. I am staying away as much as I can for obvious reasons. One day many months later, I invited him to an art show I was part of together with another 100 people. I wouldn't be there in person as I'd be away,  but I just wanted to tell him about it before it closed 2 days later. He couldn't go,  but asked me about my plans for the future. I said that I'm staying here if I can find a job,  but otherwise I'm moving abroad. He starts to scramble for phone numbers to people who may help me find a job so that I can stay. I'm so surprised and so happy that he wants to help me. A week later I decide to try calling the numbers. One person is thrilled to help me once she hears I got her number from this guy. We decide to meet next week and talk about it. Then,  she never responds again.  Next time I see the guy, he pretends not to see me.  I go to look for jobs elsewhere,  people whisper and people go from nice to ice cold over night.  I decide to move out of town when my contract ends, to be free and enjoy the summer on my own, near to the sea. Have a change of environment  before I go abroad.  I move. Then I realise that this guy and his girlfriend has moved there too. Now,  we're practically neighbours and I have to pass their house every day. It all seems stranger and stranger. Many more coincidences happen and they are all to my disadvantage. His girlfriend acts like I'm a crazy person. It's such a pity,  because I think they're both great people that I think I might have been friends with if this strange situation had not occurred. I saw him again in the street and we talked about the ocean.   Last thing I saw of this man was when I came to say goodbye. I was leaving a few days later, so while I was walking to the ocean as I do daily, I walked by the street I used to live, and there he was. He got super annoyed when he saw me and walked away before I had a chance to say anything.  So. I've left,  but am in a transitional location. I am making plans to leave. But I feel this deep shame and sadness. I never want to visit that town again. Yet I wish I could explain myself. Though it would probably make things worse.",01Nov2019,1

69,"In February of this year I was dating this girl, we had good fun together and after some months she told me she was pregnant. Wow, well after the initial shock I was pleased, after all I have always seen my self being a pretty good dad and liked the idea of it. Later that week however she told me she can no longer be dating me as she is unsure who the dad is, she can't do a relationship due to this. Ouch, this chucked me in a bit of a depression for a few weeks and I ended up going to the doctors and got reffered to councilling for the use of drugs. This feeling soon passed and I managed to get off the drugs, dispite her going back on her words of not being able to do a relation ship and starting to date someone who I had noticed she'd been talking with whilst dating me earlier that year.

 Back in the summer I became very good friends with this girl who was in a friendship group of mine, let's call her Milly. Maybe I should mention my friends live together in a large 6 bedroom house whilst studying for university. 
I felt like we were becoming close to the point of which something may come out of the friendship. At the start of August there was a day party we had all planned to attend and I slept around their house along with a couple other friends, Jack and Tom let's say, who did not live in the house. Upon bed time one of my mates disappeared. I thought maybe he decided to sleep in the spare room rather than the uncomfortable sofas in the living room. In the morning however it transpired he had been sleeping with said girl, Milly, which came to quite a surprise for all of us. Might I add that the body language between me and Milly was quite obvious. Even a friend of mine outside the group has noticed there is something going on between us so when I realised Jack and Milly were sleeping with each other I felt like I'd been slightly snaked out and betrayed by both of them for just blatently doing such a thing. But okay what ever. 
In a slightly sour mood and getting frustrated about how long everyone was taking to get ready, I left for the party an hour or two before everyone else, deciding to walk an hour my self to the event. I met up with everyone there and saw my faverout music act which really enjoyed with all my mates from the house, however as soon as it ended I was thrown back into the low mood I felt earlier that day. 
I had been spending some time on my own when I heard a familiar voice shouting over to me. It was a good friend and ex girlfriend, Jess. Jess had been going out with another friend who I will call Steve for several years until June when they grew apart. I spent some time with Jess and her flat mates and had fun, I was forgetting about what happened that morning and felt my normal mood coming back. We went to an outside area and all my other mates were also there. Cool I thought I'm feeling better now, hopefully I can have some fun again with my friends. I was dancing and having fun when I felt a hand on my back. It was a mate of mine telling me to stop hanging around with Jess because it was p#ssing off Steve. 
This came like a slap in the face and after what felt like 10 mins of just standing still surrounded by dancing people, letting what I just heard sink in, I gathered my self and walked out of the venue to return the hour walk back to my car near where my mates lived. After some thought, I got in my car and decided to go home. After 10 mins or so driving, I decided to park up as I was far too intoxicated and chose to sit in my car and people watch for the next 4 hours or so. 
During this time I was texting Jess and she was just as annoyed and shocked as I was about what had happened that day and after Insisting to come and check if I was okay and me saying its a waste of her time, I gave in and told her where I was and she came to see me. We sat and talked about the situation, about how we dated 10 years ago amongst other things. We ended up kissing and when I felt sober enough i drove the short distance home after dropping her off. 
The following day, Steve messaged me asking for an apology and an exploration for what I did and how I reacted when hanging out with Jess, at which point I basically said to do one if he had a problem with it. It later emerged she had Jess had told him we both made out and this just made things worse. I still refused to apologise as I felt I was not in the wrong and later that week after just not replying to his childish accusations, he came to my work and keyed snake in on my car right across the passanger door. Wanting to be the adult and knowing he ws expecting retaliation, I took no action. I haven't heard from anyone in this friendship group, nor really seen any of them in 3 months now, dispite others being close  friends with me since around 2008ish. 

After all this, I began spending more time with another female who I'll call steph who used to date Jack, and after a couple months of us going out and spending time with each other, she asked if we wanted to start dating. After some consideration I agreed. I felt it took some thinking as I am brilliantly blind to red flags in relation ships and she is renouned to sleeping with other guys. We spend the next few weeks spending time with each other and ge really having a great time when suddenly, on the way to drop her off for a curry night with some friends of hers, the sudden slap in the face of how lonely I actually felt. I had no one other than Steph. All my friends have turned their back on me. The girl who is carrying what is probably my baby is with someone else. 
I hit rock bottom that week, and when Steph stopped replying one night I cut my arm in a last ditch attempt to get something. She replied and got pretty mad. Turns out she'd been spending time with a mate of hers and getting off her face on vallium. Great. I didn't hear from her for a week after this. After lots of of ignored messages asking what is going on she replied stating she reacted badly to me hurting my self and she did not now how to react so decided to shut down and ignore everyone. Then again, back into silence, I've not heard anything again now in days dispite seeing videos of her out with he friends. I'm not normally like this, but having literally no one I feel I can reach out too has made the situation 10x worse. 
Amongst all this I have been spending weeks away from home training to join the fire service and I am in the last week of training but all this mental stress is making it very difficult. I will finish it however and I'm very proud of my self for changing my life so much in order to achieve something I never thought was possible even though the intensive process of getting this far has been stressful in its self. 

I'm not sure what I am expecting to gain out of this post, validation, help, other people's similar situations? I don't know but I felt like I needed to get it all off my chest as I'm feeling rather lonley and I have no where else now to vent my emotions or listen to my problems.

Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is the direct result of living through incredibly traumatic events.  We all know what this lovely, intelligent, graceful, elegant lady lived through.  It was a day that traumatized much of the nation.  

Before, she was bubbly and vivacious. After, much of her life was spent trying to hide from a world with an insatiable desire to know her life.

Not only was her husband murdered beside her, but she was never allowed the privacy she so desperately wanted.

And yet she dealt with it with grace and dignity.  No matter her own pain, she remained the definition of a lady.

I was in this spot about two years ago, and they were aware of it. Really though, the only reason they were aware of it was because I was in such a crisis that I gave very blatant hints that I was harming myself and such. I didn't know what else to do. I really needed help. 

After that I started seeing a counselor and I got a lot better, and I feel like they thought that I recovered and was okay. But the counselor changed jobs and wasn't able to see me anymore, and I haven't been able to find anyone different to help me. My last session with her was in January. I had a session with someone else in June but that was because of something specific and I feel like it didn't really count, and I didn't really feel comfortable with that counselor at all.

But because I haven't been able to have any sort of counseling or anything, I have completely deteriorated. To the point where I'm harming myself again. I feel like if I keep going down this path I'm going to become a danger to myself. I'm not there yet though. 

But the point is that I really need my friend's support right now, and I don't know how to ask for it. I don't know how to even approach them about this. 

I've tried to sorta be open about my struggles if that makes sense, but I feel like I always come across so nonchalant about it that they just don't really believe me anymore. 

I don't know if this is gonna make sense at all, but in reality I was just sorta... disassociating myself from it I guess? I don't know how to explain it. I just said the stuff and didn't think about it because I didn't want to be emotional. I feel like that has turned around on me because I don't think they take me super seriously anymore...

I also sorta feel like I'm just gonna be dumping my issues on them if they don't ask how I'm doing first. Like if I just say to them one day ""hey I'm not doing so hot"" it'll be just like me dumping them with issues they didn't ask for. 

I don't know how to ask for help, and I don't want to put the responsibility of making sure I don't hurt myself on themselves because that is completely not fair to them. I guess I just want people to like...check in? And I want to know that if I do fall into a crisis then I won't be alone and I'll be able to ask for help. 

Even as I'm typing now, everything I'm saying feels so selfish. But I can't keep doing this alone anymore. 

It sounds shitty but I almost want to just hint that I'm doing bad so they at least sorta believe me...

I've thought about saying something like ""hey, remember this? I'm doing bad like this again, and I really need help"" but I don't want to cause alarm over me harming myself again. 

I don't even know if they're gonna know how to help me. 

My worst fear is that they aren't going to know what to do so they're just going to abandon me. 

Please help me.",01Nov2019,1

74,"Hi. Bipolar II, taking lamictal daily (100 mg) but due to anxiety I'm going to try pristiq again. Previously I had stopped  the drug b/c of side effects of constipation and not sleeping great (no trouble getting to sleep, but waking up very early and not getting back to sleep).

Even after getting off the pristiq the first time I was still sleeping poorly so MD suggested a small dose of ativan each night and that has really helped. We are trying the pristiq again b/c of anxiety like I said above. 

What advise i'm looking for is when is the best time to take pristiq in your experience.. should i take first thing in the am or right before bed.

75,"So I've never used reddit for advice before, but more and more bad things are happening and I feel like I'm going insane. In 2nd of December I have a meeting in a public clinic but I don't know if I can stand it to this time.

I'm not fluent in english so I'm sorry for mistakes. I'm not sure what things I should describe to make the situations clear becouse there'r so many and I don't want to write too much cuz nobody would read it .....

So I had mental issues for a few years at least, I was in a mental hospital where they diagnosed me with anxiety personality disorder and depression but I think it can be something more. I was there only for 2 weeks tho (and 3 weeks in the ""open"" mental hospital but i gave up bc they didn't let me join group sessions thro all that time I spent there, they were saying I'm not ready). I tried 2 times to commit suicide before that, but the medications I took wasn't enough so now I have a plan to hang myself in a forest that hopefully will be effective. It's the worst time to do it tho, becouse my family have a big money problems now and debts to pay and a furneal would be just another dieseaster ( also it's christmas soon which btw gonna be the worst christmast in my live and I don't know what to do so I don't have to participate in it). I dont think I can stand it waiting for the ""right moment"" to kill myself tho bc I've been waiting too long anyway.

So I though maybe If I move out from my family's house I'll fell better finally. I live in another city with my friend for a month now and... it's not better at all. I cant stand myself. Im so anxious an litterally scared especially when I'm home alone. I do take meds but personnally I don't know if they work (maybe they did at the beggining and now my orgsnism is used to them, idk). I can't just sit still and do anything, I have to stand up and go clean anything. I can't relax bc in the back in my mind there is always a fear something is gonna happen. It drives me crazy. I'm very sensitive to sounds. I hear every step my neighbour does coming back home or walking in their kitchen. I hear their talks in my bathroom. I feel like anything I say they can hear too AND see what I do so I'm acting like they are watching me so I need to act in a certain way. Sometimes I'm scared to go to the kitchen or move at all (I feel like I need to lay down and don't make any move bc something's bad gonna happen). When my friend is home I feel more save but these things doesnt all go away. I know her many many years and I'm so glad I can live with her but... I avoid spending time with her or talking with her. Sometimes when I'm tired after all my obsessions I even feel parslised when she comes to my room to talk or something. I feel like I need to watch my moves and act normal. Of course I'm not so careful about my behaveour ALL the time, sometimes I can do my thing and forget about it but then it always comes back sooner or later. Also more weird obsessons appear or ""evolve"". And these weird thoughs doesnt appear only when Im home.

There are so so many things that'r killing me but idk if anyone is gonna read this and respond so idk if it makes any sense if I write more. I don't want to go to the mental hospital, I dont want people calling me asking why am I there again. Also I just found a new job and I can't lose it bc I already have only enough money to drive there and with other costs my friend is helping me so if I lose it it means I cant give it her back and part of my payment will go to my mum bc I need to help her pay the debts. Also I'm from Poland, female and 20 y'old if any of that matter. I don't know if there is any solution that won't bring more problems with it (unleess I assume that after my death I won't care abt all the things that happens after it anyway).",01Nov2019,1
76,"Im a college senior (21F) and I’ve been talking to a friend of mine (she’s been diagnosed with depression/ anxiety) about my recent behavior/ emotions and she believes I may have some form of mild-moderate anxiety.

As of the past year, being in a relationship and trying to graduate with a difficult major has brought a lot of stressors upon me. I’ve been developing habits such as picking my cuticles till they bleed and developing red patchy rashes on my chest when anxious about something I’m worried about. A lot of times at night I lay awake with my heart pounding in my ears thinking about stuff coming up and things I still need to do or events in the past that I’m now overthinking.

In my relationship, my bf told me he’s noticed I’ve gotten a lot more aggressive/ easily irritable and it’s impacting our relationship. Sometimes I feel like I need to pick a fight with him when I’m stressed, even over stupid things he’s done innocently ( like got home late from work or playing xbox with his friends instead of going to bed with me). 

I’ve also just been really over analyzing everything. I feel like I can tell how others are thinking or feeling and I feel like I need to conform myself to make them happy or like me. I’m in my head a lot and sometimes I really need it to just be quiet and calm and I need clarity. 

My friend mentioned Xanax but I’m thinking it may be too strong for what I need. I’m not like hyperventilating  or locking myself away from society because I can’t function. But I know I’ve definitely changed mentally and it’s exhausting. Any tips or advice? And what kind of doctor should I see?",01Nov2019,2
77,"I was just writing this to get it out of my head, but I thought I'd share it...

This year isn’t going how it was supposed to go. I’m meant to be doing better than this. When I think about it, I can see I’ve made progress. But in my mind, it’s not good enough.
I’ve lived with a diagnosis of depression and anxiety for almost a decade. I didn’t feel like I was making progress. Over the years I’ve tried half a dozen different medications and seen multiple counsellors, phycologists and doctors, but nothing seemed to stick.
I thought my luck had turned around when my newest doctor referred me to a psychiatrist who gave me a new diagnosis - Borderline Personality Disorder. I was given a different type of medication, an SNRI rather than an SSRI, and started DBT, a new type of therapy I’d never tried before. I had a completely new attack plan and it gave me the most hope I’d had in close to three years.
I was due to get married in July. The wedding planning was very stressful for me, leading up to the event I had days where I was so stressed out, I just wanted to call the whole thing off, crawl in a hole and cry. I was still attending therapy and taking medication, but I attributed all the extra stress to the wedding and wholeheartedly believed it would dissipate once I was married. Long story short; it didn’t.
I have mixed thoughts about my wedding day. It’s supposed to be the best day of my life and although I enjoyed myself, the whole thing seemed anti-climactic. Months of stress over one day felt so silly. My wedding was beautiful, and everything went according to plan, but it wasn’t magical for me, and I felt very guilty about that. 
As I said, the stress I had amounted during the lead up to the wedding did not dissipate. It clung to me, suffocating me. My doctor increased my medication. In the months since my mood has still been all over the place. The increased medication wasn’t making a difference and I had stopped making progress with DBT. 
I realise now, that I always had a long way to go. I believed this new treatment method would be my instant salvation and when it wasn’t, I told myself it was only being delayed by the stress of planning a wedding. I have a long way to go and a lot more work to put in, but this realisation hit me hard because I hadn’t accounted for it. My plans for the future had no room for my sub-par mental health.
I’ve been struggling at university. I’ve been struggling with the learning style, the deadlines, the travel and the stress. I haven’t been able to improve my time management and constantly lack the motivation to study. When something doesn’t work the way I want or expect, my immediate thought is to quit the subject and drop out of Uni altogether. I’m trying to challenge it, but I don’t believe I’ll graduate. In my mind, it’s a certainty that I’ll fail eventually. Even if by some miracle, I come out of this with a degree, I have no faith in myself that I’ll ever be able to work in the industry. 
Looking back, I can see the improvements I’ve made. I’m smiling more, laughing more and even going out more. I rarely take the PRN I was prescribed for panic attacks and can now go to work without my heart trying to rip itself out of my chest. I’ve taken on a new volunteer role for the water polo association I play in and I’m trying to start new hobbies as well as get back into old ones.
It’s been months since I’ve put myself in danger with purposeful reckless driving or broken something in a fit of rage. I haven’t run away with no plan in the middle of the night and rarely crawl into the small, dark space in the cupboard and pretend the world doesn’t exist. I still have bad days and weeks at a time where I feel empty and numb and even though I still have fleeting suicidal thoughts, I can now definitively say I want to live.

82,"I am 17 years old. My grandfather had 3 children, 2 of whom are very successful. But the third one who is extremely unsuccessful is my father.
As far as I have been told the story, he was a very bright child, but also very misguided. He got into bad company, strayed from studies etc. And one day, when he was around 20, he went along with his friends and did some drugs. The drugs had drastic impact on his mind, he suffered alot, and he took on some mental illnesses (he is still given the schizophrenia medicine). 

Now after all this happened, my mother was tricked into marrying my father (she did not know he was crazy) and that is another elaborate story which we don't need to go into. Then they had two children: my sister, who was 5 years older than me, and I. 
Growing up I remember I never had good relations with my father(I remember some instances when he beat me up). He also works a very poor job in a nearby school. 
My grandfather, who was a great man, brought me up and taught me good things etc. And I excelled in academics and all, and did pretty well in school. I will say I am good around people etc. But now, since I have grown up, I have this amazing anger towards my father. It feels that he is the only person in this world I can actually kill. Now he does not raise his hand on me, but whenever we have arguments, I instantly get this amazing anger and strength I did not know I had, and honestly I just hate him. Even as I write this I feel angered. 
I have tried to calm myself by trying to understand that he is not mentally stable etc, but it doesn't work. The anger and urge to fight him is almost growing everyday.

I’m now convinced she is a covert narcissist and I don’t know if I’m paranoid from the medicine. She ticks a lot of those covert narc boxes, but at other times, puts family and friends ahead of herself.  She even seems to be in pain with empathy when her loved ones are struggling.

Clearly she needs to see something, which will not be easy to get her to go, especially when she realizes why I'm taking her, but it's concerning for sure.

I seem to have pretty large mood swings somewhat often. They usually involve me going from really happy to very upset very quickly, and it takes a bit of time to break out of it. There have recently been a few days where I have avoided seeing my friends in person after I felt like I embarrassed myself, and there have been a couple days where I haven't left my room if I don't need to for class.

There are a few breaks every couple of weeks where I feel very unmotivated and it is hard to concentrate on what I'm doing. I get overwhelmed easily and panic, although I don't have panic attacks, I don't think. I don't really have suicidal thoughts and I don't self harm. My self confidence wavers a lot.

Any time I look up possible diagnoses I usually only identify with half the symptoms. I can't tell if this is a big deal or if I should go see somebody.

95,"As i recall, I've pretty much had intrusive thoughts at some point in my life but was never bothered by them. Starting last December i unexpectedly had a horrible thought which led me to believe that i was a bad person who wanted to do horrible things. This was followed by great shame and guilt which made me question myself regularly: Am i a bad person?, what does this thought says about me? Am i a psychopath? What would make a person think this? The thoughts would make me become obsessed for days or weeks at a time as i would try desperately to make it stop. I would spend hours and hours reading about intrusive thoughts and ocd online, then i started to tell my bf about the thoughts to which he said that it was normal and everyone has them. However this only made me feel relieved temporarily. As soon as i got over one bad thought i was hit with something worst. My intrusive thoughts included *what ifs* such as: what if i were a pedophile?, what if i became attracted to my family members, what if i had an urge that i couldn't control? And so much more dark horrible thoughts towards the people who i loved and cared about the most. It became worst when i started to have them during dinner, intimate moments basically anything that made me happy. My intrusive thoughts focused mostly on pedophilia, sexual and harm ocd. At one point my ocd was letting me believe that i was getting turned on by the intrusive thoughts which and me constantly check myself. Never at any time did i enjoy any of those thoughts yet i'd have what you call gronial movements. 
Tips on how i got over my ocd and intrusive thoughts:
1) Do not engage with the thought. You have an odd horrible thought- instead of questioning why you're having them just say what was that and continue doing whatever you were doing.
2) Accept the thought. This doesn't mean you have to like the thought or be okay with the bad thing. Just accept that you had a bad thought and move on.
3) know that you're not alone, we're human and our brain is constantly looking for problems to solve, distract yourself.
4) Understand that these thoughts are just your brain sending signal to you to make sure you're being careful for eg. you're walking down a stair with a knife and have an image or thought about falling and stabbing yourself. The reason for that thought is to let you be aware of what could possibly happen if you're not careful. So to avoid that you would  walk slower.
5) know that the reason you're constantly worried or feel guilty and shame of the thought is because you're afraid if you want to do it... someone who actually want to do any of those things won't feel ashamed or even think about it. 
6) know that you're not a bad person based on your thoughts, your actions and contributes toward society is what really matters.
7) understand that gronial movements because of intrusive thoughts is normal, our brain only needs to hear or think about sex and it would start sending signals to the rest of your body. It doesn't mean that you want do any of these things or what them to be done to you. 
8)Make jokes about it. 
9) know that when we die we wouldn't be remember for our thoughts or whatever we have going in in our head. People will remember us for who we really are. The person they can see and know.
10) The most important one for me is EXPOSURE.. for an entire year i stayed away from my nieces because i was afraid i would hurt them.. just a few days after i started being around them my intrusive thoughts were just thoughts, they didnt matter to me, i realized i wasn't the person in my thoughts, i stopped living in my head and started living in the present. 
Scared of being a pedophile? Go take a walk to kids park and show your self that you can go to the park and not hurt anyone. 
We want to do the exact opposite of our intrusive thoughts, we are not bad people, our thoughts are constantly manipulating us but its been proven that no one with ocd/ intrusive thoughts has ever hurt anyone.  Bad people simply do not care. 
Think of intrusive thoughts as a bully. The more attention you give to a bully the more they will want to bull you, ignore them and they will eventually leave you alone. 
It also helped that i explain to my close family and friends about ocd, intrusive thoughts and what it's like living with it and they were all supportive, said that its normal and nothing worth ruining my life over, and that they know me and the person i am. I do still have intrusive thoughts now and again but they don't make me feel shame or guilty. It's important to understand that Instrusive thoughts are normal and each and everyone of us has them but us with ocd just have it difficult to let things go and always need reassurance but let thought be thoughts.

I (20M senior college student) used to live abroad when I was very young but eventually returned to my home country 7 years ago. In the 7 years that I've lived here, I've never hung out with someone outside of school or college. Every Friday, people would go to parties and hang out with their friends after school. Me? i'd go straight home, lie on my bed and browse reddit, binge youtube, or play games on my laptop till i'd fall asleep. I've been through the exact same routine for 7 years. These 7 years are just a blur. I can't remember anything special when I look back at them.

-I cant speak my own language (arabic) properly. I read, write, and speak at a 6th-grade level, which is embarrassing. This, as a result, makes me suck at social interactions and hence I avoid them or else I'll be ridiculed and people will think I'm retarded for not being able to speak like an adult.

-I'm ugly. I got a 4/10 on the r/amiugly sub (note that this is a sub where people sugarcoat ratings to make you feel better). My unattractiveness has fueled my social anxiety.

-I have an awful case of social anxiety. My forehead drips in very visible sweat when I get nervous in social situations. The visible sweat is what prevents me to go up and talk to someone. At least if i wasn't sweating, i could hide my social anxiety. but the sweat is visible, anyone can see it. hence why i avoid any social interactions..

-Me avoiding social interactions and being ugly has made me socially inept. I struggle to hold basic conversations and I can't naturally speak and reply to questions like I can online. You'd get the impression that I'm borderline autistic just talking to me irl (but i'm not). 

######My current thoughts

-You might wondering 'why not just learn arabic'? Well, I hate living in my country, which is very backwards and poorly developed. I want to get out of this place asap and that is why I’ve been attempting to self-learn programming (frontend web development) while I’m in uni studying MIS. I’d rather spend my time learning that then learning arabic. Realistically I don’t have the time to do both. 

-I still have one year of college left, I then have one year of military conscription (this is going to be torture since I don’t know arabic), and then at least 1.5 more years to get a job that’ll give me the experience points I’d need for immigration. 

-So 3.5 years left to keep living in this torture — being depressed, thinking about death, hating my life, hating that I have no friends, hating that I can’t talk to women. I don’t think I can do it. Idk why I’m supposed to suffer like this, I’ve always been a polite, quiet kid who kept to himself.

-I need help, I need advice, I need someone to talk to.",01Nov2019,1

98,"I'm well aware that the vast majority of people on here are not mental health professionals and I am not in any way asking for an official diagnosis. I just need a starting point. I know I need to go to a therapist or psychologist or something but for now I need something to start with, need to know someone out there feels the same way or has any idea what I COULD be dealing with and tips for ways to help alleviate some of the shit going on in my head because I dont understand it at all and I'm terrified.

So, when I'm okay, I'm normal. I seem to have a typical day, seem like a typical person, laugh, smile, joke. And it feels natural. But when I'm not okay, I'm explosive. If I feel hurt, sad, angry, anything other than happy or okay, really, I absolutely explode and it's almost always the same. I get angry and I want to hurt everyone and everything around me, almost to the point where I have no control of myself. I say and/or do things that I wouldn't normally do almost like I want to hurt the other person and I think I actually do actually want to in the moment but afterwards I have no idea why I said or did those things. Then immediately after the initial explosion, I get completely numb and I want to do things that I wouldn't normally do because I'm too scared (or smart), like bungee jump, drive 130 on the freeway, try meth (again. I've tried it in an episode before). Then I hit rock bottom and want to watch myself bleed. Sometimes I just want to cut to feel the physical pain and sometimes I want to actually die. It depends on how bad the episode is. And even if I can fight the urge to hurt myself (or kill myself. I've only made 1 attempt..  and failed, obviously), I hate myself on a primal level. Because I know I'm being stupid, I know I shouldn't feel or act the way I do but no matter how hard I try, i say or do something hurtful either to myself or someone else. And usually i just try to shut up and get through it listening to music or something but I'm going through an episode right now and this is the longest ""numb stage"" I've ever been through and I am literally terrified that I won't be able to stop myself from doing something stupid. I'm sitting in a QT parking lot ignoring all calls and texts from the people who love me because I feel nothing right now and I literally dont give a shit that they're worried sick. I just want to be left alone...

And I cant tell anyone I love the shit that is going through my head because I dont know how to. Seems odd being able to ask complete strangers for help when I cant even ask the people I love, right? 

Tl:dr I'm fucked up and I know it but I dont know how or why. I really dont think there's a way to shorten my novel, sorry. Anyone wanna try for me?",01Nov2019,3
99,"Hi, yeah I need to see a doctor, but since this week are closed because of the festivity.. I ask here

from about some times I'm noticing, a worsening of language skills and mathematical skills (for example today I struggled to do a simply multiplication like 9\*3, and the result was always 18, before realizing that I was doing 9\*2 and NOT 9\*3)

Also sometimes I have some memory lapses, or better, I'm doing something (first intention), and I find myself somewhere else by doing nothing or something else, for the moment I don't know wth I'm doing, but If I rethink what I was doing, I remember it, so, basically when I'm doing that action that I didn't intend to do, it's like I got ""off"", but in that moment that I got off, it's like I'm doing automatic things, that I didn't intend to do, and when I repass ""on"", I find myself without no idea on wth I'm doing, but if I rethink what I was doing, I can remember what I was doing, after the first intention;

so maybe my decreasing math/language skills, are connected with that

104,"I fucking hate being socially anxious. I would honestly give up anything to not be. I'm not afraid of anything except being embarrassed. And it's possible to embarrass yourself anywhere there are people – which is everywhere – so it limits everything you do.

I have a new job that I've been doing for about two weeks now. I'm responsible for making time critical decisions as well as giving orders to numerous subordinates. How the fuck I landed this job is a complete mystery. I sometimes feel 'the block' slipping in – where I'm entering a panic and feel my thought process being blocked from the task by anxious thoughts. I freeze up and start bumbling like an idiot. It's worse when someone is shouting at me. I can't function. After the fact, I'll ruminate over and over on what happened and find anything and everything that I messed up. With each rumination, the memory of the event becomes worse in my head so that I feel even worse about what happened than when I first walked away from it.

Previously in my life, I went away to university and had a kind of breakdown – suicidal thoughts and all that. I came home, got a simple job and everything seemed to get better. Everything was simple until I took this new job to push myself out of my comfort zone. I thought I was getting better but I'm beginning to feel uneasy all the time – just like I did at uni. It's like I've bitten off more than I can chew and I'm worried that I'm going back to that dark place. At uni, I didn't have any idea what was going on with me but now I have a better understanding of anxiety and depression so maybe I'll be fine if I practice CBT stuff diligently. Maybe it's just normal to feel like this starting a new job? Maybe I will gradually relax into the role?",01Nov2019,2

The thing is, all of these things are minor in the grand scheme of life. I don't feel like there's any reasonable cause for getting more than a little annoyed over them, yet the welling up of emotion doesn't reflect this. 

When I get angry I first scream, then hit myself.  A further, major issue here is the self harming. I take out my anger by beating myself up-literally. Usually with repeated blows to the right side of my head. Once, the blows were so hard that I gave myself mild concussion for a day. I try to avoid doing this in public or aroubd loved ones, but occasionally my wife witnesses it and it's especially frightening for her. 

I have tried to find local support groups in my area, but funding cuts mean there aren't any. I have found meditation to very mildly reduce outburst frequencies, but feel I could find better solutions.

I  was in bed most all day Monday and Tuesday.   Skipped school and work.   Managed to get my son to his school on time and came home back to bed.

Got up to pee a couple times as needed.

Did go to the chiropractor appointment Monday evening,  with my wife driving and guiding my body movements.

Then home to bed.

Slept all night both nights too.

I  originally thought it was a stomach bug or something.  Guts didn't feel  right, loose stool, etc.  But nothing terribly consistent.

Then  after a noonish nap on Tuesday,  I looked at my velcro dog.  Can't be  more than 5ft away.  Still technically a puppy (he's  115lbs of beef and  teeth now, but he's still my puppy)  and my brain broke.

I  started bawling thinking about how horrible it must have been for him  to be a stray, then on a shelter hold for a month, then my motley crew  of a family rescuing his nameless 8mo old butt.

And I lost it all, and tried to purge 20yrs of repressed emotions in a quick cry.

I wept a bit when my uncle died.  I was sad when my brother killed himself,  but I have not CRIED like that in well over 20yrs.

It  was physically painful and seriously awkward.   Lots of gasps, not a  lot of actual tears, tons of snot....still made the eyes look all  bloodshot.

And then came the headache.   It almost felt like the left and right hemispheres tried to separate from each other.

Then I was exhausted.  Again.

When  I woke up again in the evening,  6hrs later or so, my body had that  shaky feeling, as if I'd just finished throwing up.  Pounding heart, in  increased  blood pressure and so on.

Wednesday  I returned to the civilized world, didn't speak of these events.  Just chalked it off to a stomach bug.

I'm still physically shaking at times, probably due to malnutrition from the first few days before and during being bed  ridden.

The chest pain or feeling of high blood pressure I've yet to regain control of.

Still haven't had a solid bowel movement since Saturday either.

===   apologies if this is too much. I haven't experienced anything like it  before and its left me rather shaken still.   Plus behind on normal  responsibilities",01Nov2019,0

Who do you think of when you hear the term ""major depression""?

I think of this dearly missed man, Robin Williams.  

When I think of Robin, I don't think of his phenomenal talent.  I think of his heart.

There are countless tales of him putting good into the world.  Making a child laugh her head off while standing in line.  Comforting a stranger coping with loss in an airport.  And on and on.

Robin, in many ways, lived in the darkness. He knew it's shapes and shades and textures. And he combatted it daily with the light that is laughter and love and compassion.

I still adore his performances.  They still make me laugh and cry and think.  He still makes me feel deeply and profoundly.

But it's not his performances that the world should miss most.  It's his heart.

28 y/o M
I live in the United States and currently get most of my medical care from the Veterans  Affairs. I was medically retired from the United States Army for post-traumatic stress disorder and have been receiving treatment for this condition since 2015. A recent appointment with the psychiatrist (non-prescriber) suggested that I stay in a mental health residency for 30 days to receive an evaluation. At this time the decision is a voluntary and I do not have to go. Is this necessary to determine what is going on with me?  I will add a further explanation of what is going on with me down below.

Just to clear the air I am not asking for a diagnosis nor am I attempting to diagnose myself. I am just trying to get a general idea of what may be going on with me to expedite the process and getting the treatment as quickly as possible. I generally trust medical professionals and their decisions but staying 30 days away from work what carry a heavy toll so I'm trying to get as much information before I make this decision. I will include symptoms I experienced as a child, adolescent, and adult, as well as, and official diagnosis I received. Also family history of mental illness/disorders. I believe this offers some ideas to the reasons for problems or complexity of selecting care. 

As a Child and Adolescent I have a history of sexual abuse, physical abuse, mental abuse, and emotional abuse. Without getting too much into the details, I have all three traits on the Macdonald Triad. Although cruelty to animals was often not successful (failed traps and missed shots with pellet gun) there was an obessive attempt along with burning insects like grasshoppers, scorpions, ECT alive. Around nine years old I received a diagnosis of ADHD and depression. At sixteen years old, I was hospitalized for suicidal ideations and having homicidal ideations against my siblings. I never felt depressed I believe as a child I did not know how to express the empty void of emotions. Guilt, remorse, sadness, or empathy was incredibly rare to genuine often felt as anger but described as correct emotion for the events occurring. Spent a lot of time alone as a child for a number of reasons. Lying, manipulation, theft, arson, and what I felt was great perception of actions (weighing risk vs benefit). The last part kept me off the radar for a very long time often convincing other people to do my dirty work for me. 

As an adult it was very hard to determine what was going on with me. I was generally so busy while in the Army I often never had time to reflect on how I felt. Most of my previous symptoms or behaviors as a Child and Adolescent had just become subconscious decisions at this point. Projecting emotions, changing to fit in with the crowd, or in general being a social chameleon was done without any thought or care. 

Lies would roll off my tongue as if I was talking about what I had for breakfast that day. It caused me no stress or require very much effort to create. Most of my lies or stories were made up on the spot, easy to remember, and always plausible. 

Manipulation was just as easy as anything else. I did what I needed, to do to get what I wanted, regardless of who it hurts or how it affected them. You would think being in the army with values like integrity that these behaviors would be caught quickly by others but this is not the case especially in the Infantry. 

Terms like acquiring or reallocation of assets would be used to justify theft or even make it comical. To be completely honest I felt more at home there is that I ever have anywhere else. Mostost of us were Disturbed to some degree varying from depression, chemical dependency (alcohol or very rarely drugs), or post-traumatic stress disorder. This is when my machiavellian traits really showed through. I would do what I needed to get ahead regardless of who I hurt or how I hurt them. 

I married in 2014 to an old childhood friend. The situation was beneficial to both and how to keep up with normal appearances.  We had a child in 2015 and this is what I started to notice that I have a problem. I did not love my wife because that was not how or why the bond was made. When I found out I was going to be a father a part of me believed I would love this child. For three years of the child's life I had no positive or negative feelings toward the child. The behavior that was suspicious as a child I've become so normal in my career I had thought it was due to my post-traumatic stress disorder and nothing more than that. While in treatment for my post-traumatic stress disorder (exposure therapy), I had been told that this is normal and is a symptom that should go away. 

2016 I was officially medically retired from the Army for post-traumatic stress disorder. We move back to our state of origin and begin our lives again as a non-military family. I found employment with an auto parts retailer and the vast majority of my income was from the VA. Going to treatment for my post-traumatic stress disorder I had never mentioned my lack of emotion for my child. Seeing as when I brought it up the first time I was told this is normal and will go away soon. 

2017 I ended up becoming an opiate addict and was addicted up until 2019. I've recently turned my life around as far as addiction but a lot of my symptoms are still there. is not normal to not have any emotion for anyone especially your child after 4 years. Now I have a cold, dead in the eyes, and just general lack of empathy look to anyone I come in contact with. Unless I feel like giving a false first impression to someone I've never met I just act the way I truly feel and it's chalked up to my post-traumatic stress disorder. 

I have been mentally and emotionally abusing my wife. I would lie to her, manipulate her, and do anything I could to bring her down. Without going into too much detail it was ruining her life and her self-esteem. After a life-threatening event I had a revelation and saw the person I truly was. I had truly began to believe that I was not always the person I am today but a manifestation of the trauma I endured. I quickly realized is that this Behavior had not only become routine but normalized for me. So I sought out help.

this is all the information required to bring you up to speed to my original question. I went for help to the veterans administration seeing a psychologist who is a non prescriber for therapy. After explaining everything to this person the final recommendation was to go to the mental health residence for 30 days to be evaluated. This will not only come at Great cost due to missing work but I often do not do well in-group mental health settings. I have made an active effort to stop the emotional and mental abuse of my wife and through her recognition of my absence I continue to do so. 

At this time our relationship is much better than it ever has been and is improving every day. I do not feel like I am a threat to her or anyone else in my family which begs the question. 

Do I need to spend 30 days in a mental health residency or should I seek a second opinion? 

I feel the Veterans Administration has too many psychiatric cases and due to the complexity of mine it simply would be easier to have a residence observe me and diagnose me. I am willing to pay for psychiatric care outside of the Veterans Administration but I also do not want to waste money if they are going to tell me to do the same thing. So if anyone has any experience with this I would love to hear your opinion on what I should do. None of these symptoms have gone away I I've made an active effort to redirect any of my lying, manipulation, or any other disruptive social tendencies to someone else who may or may not deserve it. It's not fair but I'm just trying to protect my family.

116,"Hello reddit, 

I’m feeling a bit lost and don’t know what to do. I suffer from chronic depression. I don’t know life without it. I’m a junior in college and have decided it’s time to retry counseling. The school I go to, like many others, offer student counseling. I was nervous beyond belief to enter that office. However, I mustered you the courage to go inside and ask how to set up an appointment. The receptionist looks at me and says, “Is it a crisis?” I must have looked confused because I wasn’t expecting her to ask me that right off the bat. So, she decides to hand me a paper to fill out with information to check off. So I fill it out and check that I am not in crisis because I am not too sure where chronic depression lies. I’m not suicidal or anything but I don’t like constantly feeling like I have no purpose in life. I mention on the paper about the depression. I return the paper to her and she looks it over. Then proceeds to say, “since you are not in crisis, we can’t offer any help until January because we have a waiting list and only are accepting people that are in crisis, sorry, but you can join group gatherings to talk,” I politely declined because I am an extremely private person. I do not like to wear the ‘I have chronic depression’ on my sleeve to people. I have to establish trust with someone I feel is trustworthy in order to slowly disclose deep personal issues. Group counseling would give me major anxiety. Anyways, she refers to me to seek help from an on campus psychology clinic that is conducted by grad students. That already is off-putting to me because in my mind I fear that I can’t trust someone that is the same age as me or just a little bit older than me and goes to the same school as I do. I want to unload my deep issues and not see the person until the next session. It’s a bit strange of me, I know. I think my fear is their professionalism. Fortunately, I push my fear to the back of my mind and go to the clinic to sign-up. The student counseling center said this psychology clinic had openings. So, I sign-up and let them know why I want to get help on the paper. I turned it in and the receptionist said they will contact me for an appointment. This all happened Wednesday and I haven’t heard anything from them. I guess I just don’t know what to feel. I need help and it has taken a lot of strength to admit that I need help but it seems like it’s not important... I know not a lot of time has passed but I’m hoping for something. I even tried to volunteer for my local humane society signing up via email to RSPV on Monday to help me feel like I’m doing something worthwhile but I haven’t even gotten word back. The new volunteer orientation is next weekend. I just feel abandoned I guess since I’ve been dealing with depression for so long....",01Nov2019,3

122,"**Introduction**

Self-hate is the extreme disliking or hating of oneself. It is generally thought of as a more extreme version of guilt and shame. In milder amounts it manifests as persistent negative feelings about oneself and a general life dissatisfaction with life, but in more serious cases it can lead to self-harm, suicide, or potentially violence towards others.

Self-hate is commonly found in various disorders, including: body dysmorphic disorder, borderline personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder, and depression.

There are two main reasons why people hate themselves. The first is by repeating the negative messages they have received from others through emotional abuse or bullying; the second is their conscience is punishing them for their immoral behaviours and how they have treated people in their life.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tip 1: Repentance**

A common cause of self-hate is the result of the guilt we feel for our less than moral behaviours. Religiously speaking, it is called a sin when we behave in an immoral way that typically harms others, and the price we pay is guilt, shame, or even self-hate. Fortunately, there is a solution to this, and that solution is called repentance. Follow these three steps to practice repentance:

**1)** Write a list of things you have done that are bothering you the most.

**2)** Say a genuine and heart-felt apology, either to the people you have hurt, God if you are religious, or just say it to yourself.

**3)** Plan to change your behaviours, or the overall direction of your life if needed, and put the try to past behind you so you can move forward with a clearer conscience.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tip 2: Forgiveness**

Sometimes it is not our behaviours that are the cause of our self hate, but the effects others have had on us, due to emotional abuse or bullying. It could have been a parent, a friend, a classmate or co-worker who made you feel this way, but the best solution is the same regardless of the other: forgiveness. .

Forgiveness is the deliberate and intentional decision to let go of negative emotions like resentment, bitterness, anger, and vengefulness, which reduces your hostility towards those who have sinned, and allows you to feel a greater sense of peace and joy.

Forgiveness has also been shown in some studies to positively affect your health, by improving cholesterol levels and sleep; reducing pain, blood pressure, and levels of anxiety, depression and stress.

**1)** Write a list of things someone else has done that are bothering you the most.

**2)** Consider all the negative emotions you feel by holding onto resentment and refusing to forgive them.

**3)** Write or say “I choose to forgive X for behaviour(s) Y, because it will bring peace to my heart, and I would like to be forgiven for my mistakes too”.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tip 3: Self-improvement**

Aside from forgiving yourself and others for any mistakes and sins that have been committed, another great way to reduce self-hate is to stop focussing on the past, and start thinking of ways to improve yourself instead.

**1) Virtues** \- One of the best ways to improve yourself and feel better with who you are is to become more virtuous. This website contains a list of virtues with a brief description of each one, and the virtues that it compliments, as well as the vices they transcend. Ask yourself which virtues you are currently lacking and try to find ways of practicing them more in your life. [https://www.virtuesforlife.com/virtues-list/](https://www.virtuesforlife.com/virtues-list/)

**2) Contribution** \- Focus on ways that you can contribute to the world more. Some ideas are share your talents with the world, volunteer time to a good cause, give compliments and encouragement more freely, and practice random acts of kindness.

**3) Strengths and Weaknesses** \- Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. We all have areas of life we feel more comfortable and competent in, and we all have areas that could use some improvement. Reflect on your strengths and realise that you have gifts to share with the world. Next, develop a plan to address some of your weaknesses and find ways that you can improve and build upon them.

**Quotes**

&gt;“To err is human, to forgive divine.” \~ Alexander Pope  
&gt;  
&gt;“To one's enemies: ""I hate myself more than you ever could.” \~ Alain de Botton  
&gt;  
&gt;“If you had a person in your life treating you the way you treat yourself, you would have gotten rid of them a long time ago...” \~ Cheri Huber  
&gt;  
&gt;“Once you embrace your value, talents and strengths, it neutralizes when others think less of you.” \~ Rob Liano  
&gt;  
&gt;“Hostility, malice, and sadism are the result of helplessness and self-loathing; that they are all produced by adaptation to a hypercritical social reality and are not attributable to innate aggression.” \~ Arno Gruen  
&gt;  
&gt;“It's not all bad. Heightened self-consciousness, apartness, an inability to join in, physical shame and self-loathing—they are not all bad. Those devils have been my angels. Without them I would never have disappeared into language, literature, the mind, laughter and all the mad intensities that made and unmade me.” \~ Stephen Fry",01Nov2019,2
123,"Hello all! 

I am a woman of 29. 

I wanted to share my story. My story about my mental health. 

In 2015 I had been forcefully send into a psychiatric hospital, which was traumatic to me, I was very scared and they forced pills on me. I was diagnosed with a psychosis. Now in the year of 2019 it was as if my past has been haunting me. 

I have been reading into spiritual awakenings and I have been wondering if anyone ever experienced so much emotional pain that it felt like you wete dying? 

I met this guy last year, I grew attached to him and saw him as a friend. He had something I have been missing in my life. Then one day when he was standing in front of me, I felt this calming energy. Someone told me that it could mean my brain was lying to me. I felt that energy when he was near, and it grew stronger that it caused me to have sleeping problems. I had to end our professional relationship because of unrequited love and I had cried so much over him to the point of emotional exhaustion. I have tried mindfulness meditation, and when I did I got a image in my head of the guy sleeping, the image scared me. For a while I got vivid dreams about him. 

The last time I saw him was on January the 14th this year. And when we had to end our professional relationship, and my mental health went downhill and so did my sleeping pattern. Again, a lot of crying and feeling depressed and hopeless. My mental health declined and I grew delusional; I believed that someone from the psychiatric hospital was coming aftet me, and eventually a celebrity. I went into survival mode, and the idea of never seeing the guy I had to end things with deeply saddened me. I saw so much potential in him, and yeah, I romanticized him and it reminded me of a guy I met in 2015 who I also felt a connection with and I was so upset over him. In my mind this year I started believing I was a bad person, that I did something wrong. I made a bunch of desperate phone calls and texted a bunch of people. 

I had a few EMDR sessions, but I am not sure if they helped or made my anxiety worse. I have been having these weird dreams. Random dreams of people. I now am on both antipsychothics and antidepressia. But the thing is, I still don't feel tired and have sleeping problems, still. Either I feel empty or I have strong emotions like I cry a lot. I have been unable to concetrate and I keep repeating the past in my mind and worry about the future. I want to help people, but I am not sure how. 

I have read into spiritual crisis and twin flames and my brain went back into 2015. 

I still feel uneasy and ashamed. I feel socially isolated and I feel unmotivated to get anything done. I'm tired and not tired at the same time, if that makes sense. And I just don't know anymore, it feels like a part of my soul died with the guy since the last time I saw him. And he rejected my attempt to reconnect. 

And right now, to be clear I find myself to be a light sleeper and I still have dreams. I feel restless and tired with the world. I am worried I am going to lose my mind again, I don't feel as if I have much stimulation but also feel unmotivated. I just can't trust my own brain anymore? 

Has anyone else ever experienced something similar or do you have any thoughts on my story? I couldn't handle another manic episode, another psychosis or whatever it was. I still don't feel like I have healed. It's as if the guy broke something inside of me and opened up old wounds and I still miss him. I have no friends, but I am also tired of one-sided friendships. 

Do you believe in spirituality?

125,"  The following post may feel completely bizarre and even stupid to you - I (you) am real - what's more obvious than that? How could you possibly be anxious about it? But let me tell you my experience - maybe you will understand, or even relate and find help this? I have no other place to get this out of my system, and it's life-defining to me, so please don't judge me. 

Back in 2008 I attempted suicide by jumping off from a 8-9m high bridge to the snowy pavement. That was supposed to to be it - I really, really wanted to die, and I never thought it would take more than that to kill a 18 year old male. Past midnight I cycled from my home to the bridge that I had planned it to be; my final place in this world. My whole life had been a slow, lifeless torment of rejection and inferiority - I was rejected and treated inferior even at my own ""home"" - I put that to quotes because it never felt like a real home - I never felt loved or welcome there. I had planned my suicide for the past autumn, and finally it took just a small trigger to actually make me do it. 

I was there - at the edge of the bridge and I scanned through all the reasons to end this once and for all and I jumped. The security camera showed that I was unconscious for about 15 minutes before I woke up. I spit teeth from mouth and made it lying on my back - I thought this was the last moments of being alive, so I looked at the cloudy night sky knowing that it would be my last look upon it. 

As time passed I started to realize that I may not be dying after all - in about hour I finally made the decision to scream for help if there'd just be any chance to save anything from what was my body and brain. Some early dog walker found me and called an ambulance, and from there I have just an obscure memory of chatting with a beautiful paramedic girl in the ambulance before waking up days later in a hospital, Helsinki. 

In my first day at the hospital I just spent all of my wake up time screaming to the nurses to kill me; that they had no right to keep me alive against my will, but obviously they refused to cease of what they were doing. I was highly medicated, and slowly the deathwish started to change in to lovely addiction to the morphine and oxycontin I was all pumped up. Ironically, my memories from those hospital days are very good - I absolutely loved just lying there high to the bone from all the medicine they gave me whenever I asked for it. At some point the doctor came to me telling that I should talk to a psychiatrist but I refused it until he gave up. As my relationship with my parents was very distant (even though they did love me in the end and were heartbroken of what I had done) they never tried to talk to me either about it, and even if they had asked me, I would have rejected them as well. 

I left the hospital in 23 days, never putting a thought on what I had done and what it actually was like to still be alive. I never thought it would be important to actually go through the realization what the suicide attempt actually made me realize: that I really am REAL and I really, really exist; this experience I'm having is REAL, and whatever my experience is ever made out of, my experience is all that will ever exist to me. Back in early 2009 when I had returned to my home I for sure didn't understand any of this, nor had the required wisdom and life experience to put this all into words - all I could do was to wake up in the morning knowing that just a moment ago I was at the border of non-existence. It was the ultimate shock for me; to wake up from that beautiful dream of life into realizing that this is actually something; that I am actually something, and to question it deep inside what the F\*\*K is this ultimately; to be the point of view; THE experience; to be ME.

I returned into the same emotional and social void I was living before, but with a broken leg so I had the excuse just to play computer games all day long sipping beer at my computer. And I no longer needed to ask more, since what had been a desire to live had been replaced with the utter shock and amazement of existence itself. I became more and more curious about the most fundamental philosophical questions such as ""what is the existence and why it exists"" and ""what is consciousness?"", with maybe permanent and growing disconnection to the actual life - the dream of life that we all have until we face the death of ourselves. 

We grow and live absolutely conditioned to this life and our sober selves until the very moment we experience the OTHER; to not to exist. We spawn from oblivion into this world becoming aware of ourselves so slowly that we have time to fully condition ourselves to every inch of this experience we call life one by one - nothing will ever break the illusion until we are lying on our deathbed knowing that the next step will be on the other side, and all of this will end. Until that point we live our lives not knowing to ask what all of this is, thinking that such conditioned dream state of mind only exists at night when we sleep, never realizing that we are living in a such state right here, right now; that the life itself is just another such state where everything just happens and we take it for granted until we wake up and realize how absolutely random and peculiar s\*\*t it all was.

Years went by and only momentarily I really felt living a life again, having of what I thought were friends, always being abandoned again and returning into that cold and terrifying awareness of my own existence - here alone, at my own home, supposed to live but metaphorically speaking watching this life 10 centimeters behind my eyes, totally F\*\*king lost and alone in a world where I can truly relate to no-one, chasing their jobs, women, family, status and so on, and wondering why they never stop thinking of how weird it is that they actually exist - never actually realizing that I myself was actually stunned by that realization and that was the ultimate reason that I had such difficulties relate to anyone, or to find any motivation to build an actual life for me. All I can try to do is to try to escape into this trip called life - escape via video games, tv-series, books and drugs, and whenever I wake up, try to answer that one riddle of what the hell is this thing that pops lights on every morning and goes light out at night - this thing that refused to go away even though I tried so hard to never have this again. 

I started smoking weed at 2009, and already at 2010 it started causing me ultimate anxiety attacks, that always made me want to die and to not to die simultaneously, so bad it forced me to quit it and caused such deep depression and anxiety disorder that I spent next 2 of 4 years in a mental hospital, in few episodes that never made me back to health only carried me for few months until I collapsed into the depression again and went back to the hospital. Eventually I won the anxiety disorder and started to survive on my own again, but it was just that: surviving. I was just disconnected and dead inside as I was before the hospital episodes, and quickly started to isolate myself even more from everyone else. No work, no school, no friends - I was all alone trapped in this limbo state where my earthly me loathes himself to the bone, and where my deepest spirit (or whatever u want to call it) was disconnected from this life, dead curious just about that one thing: What is this reality? why does it exist? Why does the existence itself exist? Those were only my attempts to calm down my deep, subconscious anxiety of my own terrifying awareness of ME existing - attempts without the real language or understanding to ask the right questions. 

Then 2016 I took LSD, and I was torn away from this earthly identity completely. I was transported just as a pure awareness into that dark, timeless state of existence, knowing that I had just been here moment ago, even though I never had taken any psychedelic before. Watching back to this life I left felt like closing a book that I had read for half an hour or so. Even schizophrenics wouldn't think that a book they just read was real. And even without a body or identity, time or life, I did exist. And it was absolute f\*\*king torment. Again, I both wished to die (as a soul - to completely shut down forever) and begged this to end, to be able to keep existing because I really, really wanted to. After 8 hours in the local ER It was over and I was back in my body - feeling literally like I was born again - memories only started to wander back to my brain slowly, one by one, while I was already relatively sober and functional. I felt like a newborn watching my hands move, and I walked back to my home from the hospital I had been taken because it seemed like I had actually lost my mind from the LSD. 

Everything went back to normal in few days, but now more than ever, the shock of being real was driving me to seek the answers to the problem of existence. I become dead curious about near-death experiences and psychedelics, and spent night after night connecting the dots inside my head; how could it be that the existence itself exists, and how could it ever spawn a reality within - a reality that somehow could create a universe and a human; ME, inside, trying to understand how can it be that the existence itself exists.

On the outside everything was the same - or went even worse for that matter, and after 2,5 years, in December 2018, I found myself from a point where I knew that my only possible solution was to travel to wherever I could drink ayahuasca and see if it could heal me - any other way and I would kill myself, and this time without a fail. I traveled Amsterdam where I found it to be semi-legal, and where they actually held ayahuasca-ceremonies. I drank it, and the same happened again: I was in that dark, timeless, terrifying realm that felt more real than the illusion of life that I had left behind. But it was scorching my very existence, rejecting me, tormenting me, hating me, and making me see over and over again visions of my earthly self, running in miserable loops of failure and unwillingness to exist, just keeping myself alive because of the fear of not existing anymore. 

The trip faded and still in a shock of what I had seen, our shaman told that it was the time for another round. 

Not wanting to go back but knowing that I had come this far just to find my will to live again, I decided to go for it, and while it started as the same hyperphysical nightmare I had just left behind, it quickly started to turn very interesting, almost beautiful. Soon I realized that I was witnessing the most beautiful experience I had ever had. It was pure magic. I was present in this body, in this identity, but something in the essence of this world and me had changed fundamentally into something f\*\*king magical, and it was radiating into me from everywhere. From the walls, from the light shining into my eyes, from the water I drank, from other people in the room, and from me into this most beautiful world I had ever seen. The shamans, though visually looking like their earthly selves, looked like spiritual sentries that were watching after us, the newborn gods that were going through their awakening ritual to join into this real, magical journey of pure love and magic, as gods; as spiritual warriors to embrace every single thing in this this magical world, to live with the greatest spiritual wisdom, and to guide the others who were yet to be awaken from their dream of spiritual cocoon state. I could have exploded just out of the joy of existence and love for living, and I had finally found my true nature; a spiritual warrior, a playful child, a spiritual guide of the children yet to be awaken, and a MAN. Masculine, strong, SEXUAL, but loving and gentle MAN.

 Unfortunately, that magical experience of this world and me faded with the trip, and I went back to the miserable and weak, dying soul of me again, full of emptiness inside, and outside only inferiority and fear towards the other people around me, in a world of threats and impossible obstacles, feeling like a useless piece of s\*\*t in a handsome body. It was a 2-day retreat and the next day I went for the same full cup, hoping for a new magical trip, that only would become permanent this time. Well, it did not. We did two rounds again, and this time it felt more like a weak weed – I was fully present in the emotional void of myself and my life, just breathing to keep me alive, watching other people laughing, crying and having f\*\*king orgasms out of joy of their experiences, while I just stared in front of me, empty as intergalactic space just one question in mind: how long I’m going to last just by keeping myself alive by eating and breathing like a human? I broke into tears and I cried totally out of hope, knowing that I would return to Finland with empty hands, having used the only Joker in my sleeve that could help me not to kill myself. I spoke for an hour with the shaman, and he encouraged me to find anything that had ever made me even slightly curious. Whatever it may be, because what was clear to him was that I was living a life for the comfort and safety it brought me that I would get from never pushing myself through any obstacles that could ever harm me in any way. Even though I didn’t believe him, I knew that giving it a shot was better than shooting myself in the head, so I decided that I’d become a practical nurse, because since my suicidal attempt I had felt some very deep curiosity for working in a hospital at night. 

After we had ate a meal of fruits and water, it was time for a round of changa. It was beyond anything I could have ever imagined: I was fully present in my body, but with closed eyes I could see this beyond words beautiful world of endless, deepest, purest nexus of blue I could ever put to words, with color so bright I was actually afraid that it would make me go blind. And the weirdest part was that I was asking, hey, were did this go? How didn’t I see this a moment ago? Because I for some reason knew that it has always been there, and it was the most obvious thing to me – I just couldn’t remember when I had seen it for the last time. And I was filled with the most soothing and intense, unconditional love, so intense it was overflooding every single cell in my body and loving my soul deeper than anything could ever love. The shaman and someone from our group walked me to my bed and when everyone had taken their dose, one girl in our group started giggling for no apparent reason and we all bursted in to laughter. Even though I was too exhausted to make any sound, it was like my whole soul was laughing, deeper that I had ever laughed. 

The next morning we had to leave and the next day at Christmas eve I flew back to Finland at night, not knowing a single thing, but with a plan that I’d quit my old job that I hated, and apply to the nursing school. By all of the chances I got a job that I actually liked the same day I quit the old job, and few weeks after I got mail from the school that I was accepted there – my school would start at may 18th. Everything went very nice until the summer, when my mind started to collapse again, and I decided that I’d attend in another ayahuasca retreat.

This time the first round was the magical one – exactly the same that I had seen the last time, but I sticked with my intention not to stop there but to actually have the answer that would heal me in my life – whatever it was, since I still didn’t understand why I felt so disconnected and unhappy in my life. I went to the next round with a sword and a shield, and things escalated very quickly, very bad. When I become aware I was already there – in an infinite time loop where only thing that was real was me, lying in the bed in this room, dreaming of a life that I had somewhere, trapped by this evil spirit spirit that called herself “Mother Ayahuasca”. This time our only shaman was this lady, and Mother Aya appeared to me in her body. She was in my infinite time loop, forver sitting next to me her hand on me (in reality, our shaman was just sitting next to me trying to calm me down), injecting this absolute nightmare to me where I am EVERYTHING – the only thing that has ever existed or would exist, hallucinating a miserable life on this filthy bed in this filthy room where the other people present were there just as a reflections of my deepst self-loathing and desperation; appearing as happy, handsome people that had beautiful experiences from this “ayahuasca” and then leaving to live their happy lives, just making fun of me in my forever ending, painful and miserable existence in this room. Mother Aya was communicating me through spirit, teasing me with this “healing” she offered, like “ha ha, you want this, don’t you? You want this? Tell me you want this, you miserable little creature.”, and it went on to infinity. And I screamed to her “F\*\*K YOU! KILL ME, YOU B\*TCH! KILL ME! JUST END THIS! I WANT TO DIE! I DON’T WANT TO EXIST ANYMORE!”. At one point I actually punched the shaman, but thankfully it was just a touch on her face since I was so far away that I could barely move my hands. 

When it was over we had a long talk with the shaman and she told me that she wasn’t afraid of me, and she’d allow me to have more ayahuasca the next day, if I’d promise to drink just a half cup. I decided to go for it, and the next day trips, surprise surprise, were EXACTLY the same as my second day was the first time I did ayahuasca. Only this time I cried from the bottom of my heart, because I really understood that I didn’t want to exist anymore. I cried deeper than I ever had cried, and talked with the shaman who was there with me the whole time. Somehow she managed to make me realize that I should still give a try to this life, and the next day I traveled back to Finland, with even more lost that I flew to Amsterdam. I started to smoke weed a lot after that retreat, and surprisingly it started to give me very definitive answers to whatever I had worried in my life. It was very psychedelic – I actually experienced several ego deaths and even went to that time loop-nightmare state again, but it also gave me the clearest insights to life I’ve ever had. One by one, I started to understand why I’m struggling with my social life, why I’m so anxious and stressed all the time, until it hit the jackpot few weeks ago: I finally understood that my ultimate problem, my ultimate Nemesis is the deep, fundamental terror of existing, and how it all went back to 2008 when I tried to kill myself. That was the ultimate nightmare that had haunted me ever since, and that was the ultimate reason of why I felt so disconnected from my body and this life, and surprisingly it explained every single thing that had happened ever since. Now I see myself: Now I see how I’m actually terrified deep inside of this experience I’m having; this experience that’s ME. Now I understand why I saw what I saw on LSD and Ayahuasca, both good and bad: of how I struggled for life and begged for death, and why the second day was always just as empty and cold as my everyday life, and why I kept seeing myself as the only one that exists. Now I understand why I saw the magical paradise: It’s because it’s really this world. It’s all the love, meaning and the embrace a soul can ever have and feel in this world. This world is that world of magic and love in the essence, where we are the spiritual warriors in different states of spiritual awakening. And that’s my ultimate quest before anything else here: to acknowledge my own existence and really make the decision of whether I want to exist or not. That’s the ghost that has followed me as my own shadow all this time – the ghost that haunts me beyond this life.   
 

Now, meanwhile this post here is highly self-therapeutic, I’m also 100% positive that I’m not alone here with this same issue. You, whether you are depressed, suffer anxiety attacks when smoking weed, suffer dissociation (whether it’s because of a suicidal attempt or anything else), feel suicidal, escape your life in drugs or alcohol or video games, and so on – You maybe here on the same quest that I am. Acknowledging your own existence. Growing spiritually onto an independent, self-aware spirit that has peace with one’s own existence.   
 

At my current state I am just f\*\*king stunned by this – bouncing between the utter terror and escapism of the realization of my own existence, trying to grab on anything that could either carry me in this life or to give me a shelter to escape into, and the self-secure, confident and happy realization that I really do exist, and by my own decision I want to stand proud and loving on my own ground; to exist as ME!

Your children will not be better off without you. That is your mental illness lying to you.

You impact their lives in all the little ways you love them. You have no idea what small moments your child will keep as treasured memories. 
Life is never perfect, but if you have love for your children a lot of the other stuff (not being able to afford things, having to spend time away from them at work, not keeping the house as clean as you’d like, rarely making home cooked meals, having a difficult family situation etc.) does not matter. It truly doesn’t. What matters is the love between you and your child.

The child I’m caring for said something yesterday that I felt the need to share. She said “I will not have a Christmas ever again no more Christmas in my life if it makes my Mommy come back.” 

Precious memories of my Mom include smelling flowers outside, taking a nap on the couch together, going on walks, etc.

Sometimes I act on it verbally but never physically. 

This made me realize that with people, I either feel that intense empathy or that intense hatred based on interactions I’ve had with them. Can anyone relate?

Then it snowballs into me just not going period from the anxiety. I've moved out now so I can't just not work like I did during HS

I've applied to mutiple places since then, but I didn't even show up to two of the interviews. I was just scared because they were really good oppertunities that I was going to end up losing that job as well. I have an interview for a Comcast technician position in a week, and it's going to take everything I can just to go to it.

I've been feeling lonely as well, and I know my anxiety is constantly reminding me. I have been talking with a guy for the past month, we haven't even met up yet but my anxiety was so bad I just had to stop talking to him. I kept thinking it won't work out and stuff like that. No wonder I've never even been on a date before ;/

Even with just a moment of downtime at work for example, it's really easy to get stuck in s negative loop. My job sucks, you don't have any friends, you're ugly, etc. I don't know how much of that is the anxiety or something else but I've had to learn to always be doing something. Gaming, closely watching a show, or even just focusing my mind on something mundane to not let it wander.

142,"For background, I’ve had mild tics and obsessive tendencies throughout my life, and never have they impaired my life to a great degree. Somewhat recently, however, I visited a therapist for unrelated reasons and was told that I have OCD. What accompanied subsequent visits, however, was the message that this condition was incurable, that working with her was the only means of recourse and that attempts to address the condition on my own would not work, despite that I did not really agree with the diagnosis in the first place. For these repeated instances, as well as other issues, I ceased seeing her (and I no longer need to see any therapist).

Whatever tics or obsessions I’ve had in the past, **I’ve developed my own means of coping with them, and these have worked throughout much of my life.** A new fear, however, arose from the implications of the label itself. I eventually grew concerned that both facets of what she was telling me were true, and that I had this lifelong, incurable condition whose alleviation could only be secured by soliciting a professional.

I’m just bothered by others’ presuming to know more about me than I know about myself, and **thus implying that what I know to be working for myself is in fact not working if it conflicts with what they believe.**

I just don’t want to be beholden to this label and what specific brands of treatment are commonly prescribed to treat it, or to the impairments of lifestyle that this label seemingly entails. I also want to be reassured that whatever types of problems I may come across, **if I believe that I’ve overcome them myself, then I have.** Does that make sense?

I don’t really believe that I have this condition—or at least, I don’t believe that it amounts to clinical significance. I had an almost gaslighting type experience with that therapist. And I find it almost an insult to real OCD sufferers, with drastic intrusive thoughts of calamity.",01Nov2019,1

Also, I constantly feel like a robot, I feel as if all emotions are fake, this is probably because I do fake my emotions, my personality changes as well depending on who I am talking to and what environment I am in, I feel as if all the other persoanlities are fake other than the one I have on my own, which feels nothing for other people and completely lacks empathy.

Daughter's dad tried to kill himself by hanging on her last visit. She is 8 and he screamed at her and his mom for cutting him down for 2 days. I didnt know until very recently, she has always talked about how he beats his dog for barking and literally throws it against the wall and sees his dead brother. Well not knowing what to do I called child line n asked for services, being mandated reporters they tried to 302 him (unsuccessfully). They called CYS too. I tried to get her an appointment with a psych dr but before I could she started acting out what she saw by trying to hang my husband, then 20 mins later herself. So we obviously took her to the ER to be admitted to the ward (which took 19 hours) she told them what happened and how she didnt want to live like that anymore.

Ever since I was 13 I’ve been dealing with depression, trying to deal with the divorce of my parents, the sexual abuse and physical abuse from my step dad towards my mother and I for years. Being constantly bullied by my peers. I’m 21 now, and I still deal with depression every now and then, and suicidal intentions come into mind a lot more frequently.

I feel like I wasn’t meant to be here, I’ve had three failed suicide attempts in the past 8 years, which led me to believe I was here for a reason, but what? My parents view me as a complete fuck up that can’t take care of herself and couldn’t even get pass her first year of college without having a complete mental breakdown and dropping out. I feel like I let everyone in my life down, I can’t do anything right, I can’t fit in. My friends and best friends of seven years left me for some reason...because Im emotional, maybe? I guess no one really liked me much I just know they just only tolerated me, idk. I don’t talk to my boyfriend about this too much because I’ve already come to him so much about my problems and issues and I don’t want him to leave me like everyone else if I continue to tell him what’s wrong with me. Don’t get me wrong, he’s a great boyfriend but I believe he still deserves better than someone who’s unstable and can barely take care of herself (and plus he’s all the way in New York and I’m in Georgia so it’s already hard dealing long distance)

No matter how hard I try to actually get better and do better with myself it never works out. I fail to strive and I succeed at failing. I’m just done existing. I don’t eat or sleep much anymore. I rarely find anything fun. I just want to leave everyone and everything behind. Nothing makes me happy. Everyday is the same repetitive thing of going to my mundane job, barely speaking to anyone, having my self conscious degrading me in the mirror, my anxiety, the little voice telling me that my boyfriend and everyone else doesn’t want anything to do with me. It’s hard having to deal with this everyday. 

I’ve been stuck, I can never move forward no matter how hard I try. I’m a fuck up, always have been.

156,"You're sitting in a chair, your right calf touching the chair leg. A vague feeling of ""wrongness"" slowly permeates your leg. Suddenly you realize that you can't quite tell where your skin ends and the metal chair leg begins. Your leg and the chair are still seperate objects but they've somehow fused at the point of contact. The absence of a clear distinction between the two means you're receiving input both from nerve endings that don't actually exist, and - confusingly - from real nerve endings that shouldn't exist because your flesh doesn't extend that far (in your mind).      
This has been happening to me a lot lately, randomly fusing with objects I touch or with other body parts. As you can imagine it's freaky and more than a bit annoying. ""Breaking away"" from the object is maybe the worst part: like peeling dried glue off your hand, but the sensation penetrates a few centimeters down into your body, as well as up into your imaginary nerve endings.

Something happened between her and a toxic ex of hers. I don't know what, but he has done awful things to her in the past and claimed not to remember it from a personality disorder. She spam posted alarming things on her instagram and I got worried, and commented if she was okay. I got an angry text in reply saying to not publicly ask (when it was on a public post????) 

I tried to ask her and help her but it seems she's just been ignoring me. I thought of her as a best friend before since she's always told me anything, so I'm shook she doesn't want to talk. 

She ended up messaging my best friend locally, who she has never met or really talked to before, and told him that she's home alone and thinking of ways to commit suicide (he sent me screenshots). She's not one to joke about these things. I don't know what to do. She clearly doesn't want to talk to me and I can't travel to her house to spend time with her, comfort her, or make sure she's okay.
