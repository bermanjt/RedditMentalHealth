0,"Every little emotion I just over think. I constantly pay attention to how I feel. I constantly ask myself what emotion I'm feeling. I feel like I force myself to have certain emotions and think in certain ways, the way I act is not who I naturally am. Does anyone else feel like this?",17May2019,2

2,"Ok, so I've made a post before a while back in the mental health community because I'm currently doing terribly mentally. To give you a background, I'm currently 17 years old and a junior in high school. I have a very toxic family and no matter what I do, I can't keep up my happiness. When I go to school, certain things trigger me into becoming angry and upset every single day. Then I come home and every single thing triggers me into an emotional spiral. I'm currently unable to seek psychological help from my school or an outside source because knowing my foreign parents, they would say absolutely not. I know I only have one year left before I go off to campus where I can seek professional help, and I would always hold onto that, but not I don't know anymore. I'm writing this after having a thirty minute quiet meltdown in my room. I've been crying nonstop because I feel like I'm nothing. It's scary to say this, but I was even thinking of scenarios where I've ended up killing myself and wondering if anyone would actually care. I'm not suicidal and I've never attempted to kill myself really, but recently my mind has started to come up with these brief to long imaginations of me actually doing it. It's hard to explain, but its like I keep thinking of it but I don't actually see myself acting on it. I don't know what to do anymore and I just feel completely numb. Does anyone have any advice or have actually gone through my situation before? Thank you advance.",17May2019,1
3,"I have been dealing with these problems for years, I had trichotillomania since I was in 2nd grade, and I have trouble controlling it. Obviously, we went to a doctor to find out what was wrong with me. My mom was told that I had ADHD, but she didn't believe it. 

She told just a few months ago that I was actually diagnosed with ADHD, and was offered to take medication, but like I mentioned before, she refused. 

She told me that the doctors were useless, and whoever takes medicine like the ones offered to me are crazy and unstable. I was just eight years old back then, so I didn't wanna be associated with crazies and psychos, I didn't wanna be made fun of. 

Since I belong to a Catholic family, they all told me to just pray to God, or go to prayer meetings, or go to some scammy ""healing"" ladies. Obviously, none of them helped me. I was around 3rd grade when we were suffering some financial difficulties, my father got scammed by some lady who said that some healing oils will just turn me back to normal. I felt really guilty for that. 

It was also back in third grade that I would just lash out and cry that I wanted to die, I wanted to get rammed by some car and just die and end it all. I would scream at my mother that I couldn't take it anymore and that I wanted to fucking die. I've had so many of those thoughts later on. But boy did I really wanna fucking die and just give up, I didn't act on it, however because I witnessed my neighbor jump off our apartment building in an attempt to commit suicide. So I became scared of heights and I never dared to think about acting on it. 

Grade four rolled around, and I had to be homeschooled because my trich went worse, back then, I didn't pull my hair at home, so they figured, homeschool should work. Homeschool wasn't great for me, one time, I over heard my parents fight about something while I was upstairs, I just had to stand outside the door to hear everything, my dad had cheated on my mom, and I have two younger half sisters. 

Those were the times where in I really felt alone, I was told not to tell anybody about it, and I never really had anybody to talk to about it. And with the shit that was going on for like 3 years at that point, I didn't really know what to feel at that point, I just felt empty and that was just it.

There would be times my mom would tell me to stop pulling out my hair, cause if I keep doing so, my father would leave us for his other family. Of course I didn't want that, but I just can't control myself.

I stopped my trich for a year, and then I wanted to go back to normal school, I missed my friends and homeschool was very lonesome for a only child like me. And I didn't like hearing my parents fight and shout.

Grade 5 came in and I never really had friends close enough in my class to talk about my problems, so again, I felt alone and empty. There would  be times I wish I was dead and I ignored my studies and just watched anime and YouTube because studies were just too boring for me. This was when my mom went off on and on about how much she missed it back when I was younger, I was honor, I was normal, I certainly didn't distance myself from anyone in my family.

My mom had always compared me to other kids, since well, forever. But this just made it way worse, and whew boy did it hurt me so much that my mom straight out told me that if she could pick a kid she wouldn't pick me.

Grade 6 and grade 7 were fine, I met friends who wouldn't care about my illness and disorders, or the fact that I wear a wig, they love me past that and I couldnt thank them enough for that. My parents would just call me a problem and just often lash out at me when ever I fuck up. To be Frank, I very much love my friends more than my family.

Now I'm in 8th grade. And a few months ago my mother told me I also have ADHD, and right now I am so desperate to find any means to end this hell. I asked my mom if I could go to a doctor and see if I can take some sort of therapy or medication. She told me that yeah, maybe I could go to a doctor. I was pretty fucking happy, but the next day my mom told me that doctors were shit useless, and I would become some sort drug addict or die to some kidney issues if did so. She told me the same thing years ago, that people who take medications for where crazies and psychos.

I really want to take medications, because maybe that would make me feel better, I used so many different methods already, shit like praying, fidget cubes, fidget spinners, putty, clay, drawing, ukulele, I'd even wear a rubber band on my hand would just pull on it to hit myself rather than pull my hair out.

How do I convince my parents that doctors are actually helpful? 

TL;DR 

I have ADHD and trichotillomania, and my parents don't believe in psychiatrists and medications, or if I even have ADHD, and my life has been hell.",17May2019,2
4,"Fuck it, fuck him, fuck her, fuck you, fuck me, fuck this, fuck that, fuck that thing in particular,  fuck off, just fuck it. So tired of feeling lsd and emotions that go from 0 too 1000 in seconds that come from every day shit that people can handle but I'm left here in an existential state after dropping a glass of milk (that's not what happened). The simplest things set me off feeling like I would be better if I'm not here but at the same time I dont want to leave, it's like some sort of cruel joke that everyone else is in on.",17May2019,11
5,"I'm a 28 year old guy, and today after talking with my fiancee for a couple hours about various stories about our childhoods and high school memories, and after mentioning a few things about my friends and the kind of things we did for fun, she said ""don't take this the wrong way, but were you guys in special ed?"" We weren't. In my high school, special ed was reserved for people who were so violent or disabled that they literally could not be without a handler for more than two minutes. Everyone else was in general population. She said her school had that too, but there were other levels of special ed for people who were outside the norm in some way.  

Thinking back to elementary school, I *was* in a 'gifted' program, as well as an afterschool thing for ""Indigo Children"" but it was my understanding at the time that terms like 'gifted' and 'Indigo Child' were just terms made up by moms and used to describe kids who were creative but had poor attention spans for schoolwork, which was definitely me. 

My whole life I've kind of just felt like most people are born with some kind of manual on how to act and what to say, and I just wasn't. In most situations I just don't know what to do, so I refer back to my 'inner manual' which is all the things I've said and done that have ended poorly (or well) and acting accordingly. I kind of had to figure out what people should and shouldn't do via trial and error, whereas the way my fiancee describes it, she was kind of born with an innate knowledge of exactly what to do or say in most situations. I've never really understood why these things work or don't work or why people react the way they do, but I've done enough trial and error to determine how I should be acting or speaking in most cases. I've noticed that I have to consciously think about how I position my body or adjust my tone of voice whereas other people just kind of do it by default and don't even think about it.  

My folks had me tested for autism when I was in middle school because I was having trouble at school due to the aforementioned attention span issues, and according to the doctors we spoke to, I had a few traits of people on the spectrum (overactive imagination, more likely to believe in the supernatural/religion than most kids, making up whole worlds in my head) but that the key part of autism is being introverted and bad at group activities, and I've always been a serious extrovert and better at group activities than solitary ones, so I couldn't be on the spectrum. Also according to some of the tests they had me do, my IQ is pretty above average (which I don't believe because I'm kind of a dumbass).

In high school/college I was always pretty good at any classes involving being creative or world building (social sciences, art, music, English, woodshop, etc) but absolutely abysmal at anything involving math. Eventually the school (both high school and college) let me take ecology type courses for my math and science credits. I was always bored talking to people in my classes, and most of my friends were the kind of people my parents called ""troubled"" (they were in classes for people who weren't very smart) because they talked about things that were interesting. My crowd was largely the kind of people that listened to a lot of Mindless Self Indulgence watched Invader Zim, and identified as some kind of Pagan. When I was in college I mostly fell in with the Homestuck/cosplay/furry crowd.

When I'd talk to my peers in the AP classes, they'd want to talk about subjects I thought were boring, and I was more interested in things like pizza and Danny Phantom, or showing off my notebook full of dragon drawings, but when I'd bring it up they'd smile weirdly and shuffle elsewhere. I never had this issue with my 'troubled' friends, they all thought it was really cool and some of them are still my good friends to this day. Similarly, I'd always notice that when I told a joke in AP classes, people would nervously laugh and then whisper something to a friend, then I'd tell the same joke with my real friends and everyone would roar with laughter. 

Since I graduated from college I've been working a relatively normal job and am pretty self-sustainable, and the social issues aren't really there anymore because everyone I know has a wide variety of interests and most of them are interesting to me as well. I'm still a huge extrovert; that never changed, though now I'm more into the whole Jersey Shore/party/club scene. 

Sorry for the autobiography, but my question is, if I was developmentally disabled, would I know it? Are there different levels of being slow? Are 'gifted/Indigo Child' programs really just a fancy way of saying 'special ed'? Before my fiancee brought this up I'd honestly never even considered it.",17May2019,1
6,My friend just told me that he had witnessed some stuff that ive never heard off. I don’t really know if this is the right subreddit but didn’t find a better place. He said that he literally had seen cars and birds and everything stop around him twice in his life.

8,"I have bipolar and borderline personality disorder along with anxiety and ptsd, lately I have been spiraling down a big black hole of nothing and I’ve dealt with suicidal ideation my whole life and I’m at a point where I feel as though my will is not strong enough to tell the feeling of chronic emptiness in my chest that tells me to hurt myself no at this moment in time and I just don’t know what to do I asked my fiancé to take me to the er because I just don’t trust myself, which he hadn’t done and I’m not blaming other people who don’t have this stupid imbalance or whatever the fuck it is don’t understand and fuck neither do i , I’ve worked so hard to appreciate me and it’s taken such a long time and it’s all gone now and I just don’t know what to do I feel so unimportant , I over analyze and think I must deserve how I feel or all the stupid shit that’s been happening or has happened in my life is all bc I suck, that I don’t even have an illness.

9,"i've been dealing with anxiety and depression seriously for the past 4 years. it's gotten significantly the past two years as i've transitioned into high school. i used to have panic attacks every day before school, so my mom made me start seeing the school counselor, but she didn't help much because i wasn't comfortable telling her everything that was going on (and i didn't like going during school and coming out of the office crying). 

over the last six months, i've started to sh and i've missed several days of school because of my anxiety. my mom found my notebook and found out about my sh and suicidal thoughts, and she asked me if i wanted to go see someone to help me. i said yes, but it's been a month and nothing has come of it. i think my mom secretly hopes that i'll get over my depression and anxiety without any intervention. i want to get help, but i'm afraid to bring it up to her and she still doesn't know the extent of everything. also, my dad makes fun of people with mental health issues and i don't want him to find out. 

i'm afraid to talk to my parents or go to the school counselor again, but i don't want it to keep getting worse cause i'm starting to scare myself.",17May2019,1
10,"I have adhd- inattentive, depression, anxiety. I’m a male, late 30’s, and I obsessively worry. I told my boss that I have adhd earlier this week, kind of out of frustration that she was frustrated I wasn’t finished with something. She started to talk about how things are distracting me. I assumed she knew so I just let it out. Was this delusion? 

I really am super distracted easily. I’m up and down a lot. Adderall and Xanax combo works to keep me level but when it wears off I’m no bueno. 

So in typical fashion, my brain starts ruminations.  I think he’s playing games. Messing with me. And I’m going to lose my job. I don’t want to be unemployed. I have a family and I am the sole income.  We need to sell our house. This sucks. Don’t want to lose my job. 

Like a nightmare, over and over, with some variation, that’s pretty much all I think about. For 3 days. 

And when this passes, it’ll be something else. 

I am prescribed Zoloft Xanax and adderall.",17May2019,2
11,"So I have bipolar depression and it fucking sucks. But i have good friends and a kind of fucked up home life with my parents being divorced they fight... a lot. I think that that might also be the cause of my random depression. But usually at night when I'm alone in my bed I start thinking and it gets me depressed.

 But back to my fucked up home life. My parents fight quite a bit (my mom and step dad vs. my dad). Right now they are fighting because my dad wants to change our custody from 3 weekend a month to 50-50 custody. At one house I'm told one thing and at the other I'm told something completely different. I feel like I'm getting mind fucked and can't take it. To top it off with me being the oldest (14) I try to look out for my younger brother (11) because he doesn't really understand yet.",17May2019,5
12,"I am a 23 year old male. I've been dealing with moderate-severe health anxiety for over a year now. What I mean by that is: headache? Must be a stroke or aneurism. Chest/left shoulder pain? Must be a heart attack or arrhythmia. Nausea? Must be a heart attack or stomach ulcer. Dizziness? Must be a heart attack, brain tumor, low blood pressure, electrolyte imbalance, etc.

You get the idea. This has been going on for over a year. It started when I had my first panic attack. I thought I was having a heart attack. Ever since that first one, that's been my #1 fixation: fear of heart attack/health-related health problems. My heart rate used to sit around 70 bpm, now it sits around 90+ bpm, even 100+ bpm if I'm anxious. I'm very sedentary, because I'm scared to move around for fear of my heart not being able to handle the activity. My rate may go up to 140+ bpm just walking up a short flight of stairs. I've tried exercising, but have a panic attack almost every time. The attacks have even been extremely painful, where I really legitimately thought it was a heart attack or stroke. Bear in mind, I am not a large man. I am 5'5"", weigh only 115lbs-120lbs. I am not overweight by any means, and my doctors assure me my heart is fine and that I'm at virtually no risk for heart complications. They've told me over and over that it's just anxiety. And if they're right, this is a terrible self-perpetuating cycle where my fear of heart complications is causing symptoms that lead me to further fear heart complications. I've been put on a 25 mg beta-blocker (Atenolol) to help control the heart rate so I won't fixate so badly on my heart. Sometimes it helps, sometimes not. 

Days like today are awful. I only slept for 3 hours last night, and I started a new job today. Not a cushy office job, but a rather physically demanding job. Today was my first day, and I woke up in an awful state. Dizzy, sleep-deprived, chest hurting, heart pounding/palpitating, I felt nauseated like I would vomit. But I had to go to my first day on the job. I thought my shift would never end, I've been so miserable all day. The Atenolol has hardly helped at all today. I feel so weak and fragile, like my body is just one joule of energy away from failing me. I don't have full-blown panic attacks very often anymore, but I have days like this very frequently, where everything seems to be a huge challenge, and my body doesn't feel up to the task, and my internal narrative is just that of fear, worry, and unease. I need to sleep, but this late into the day, I'm not even sleepy. Days like this, the thumping of my heart keeps me away, until I end up falling asleep from sheer exhaustion. 

I'm seeing a therapist. Rather, I'm seeing a ""family counselor"" for ""therapy,"" though I have the sneaking suspicion that he isn't qualified to assist with this kind of clinical anxiety. All we do is chat. And I know what you're thinking, ""That's what talk therapy is!"" I'm aware that tall therapy is literally that, talking. But I don't feel like he ever asks about anything even remotely relevant or prompts me to go into any real depth when talking. It's often a bunch of asinine chatter that ends up wasting the session time I'm paying for, like he'll ask ""Hey have you played this new game for the Nintendo Switch yet?"" And then he'll proceed to tell me about the game for a good 5 or 10 minutes, when I could care less about any of that. I spend my days fearing heart failure, and he wants to tell me about the newest Mario game. I enjoy games as much as the next guy, but this anxiety has radically shifted my priorities. I don't give a damn about the games he has for the Switch, I just want to get better, get back to the days when these kinds of worries and fear never even crossed my mind. And when he does try to ""counsel,"" all his ever gives me is shit advice anyone can find on Google about breathing exercises and progressive relaxation. He is just trying to tell me how to control the symptoms of anxiety when they happen, how to not have panic attacks and whatnot. I don't want copy-paste coping mechanisms for dealing with anxiety, anyone with an internet browser can learn those, and I have. They hardly ever work for me. I want to learn how to trounce this fear, go a day without worrying and being afraid. Go a day without monitoring my heart, checking my pulse, feeling chest pains and palpitations. His while thing is panic attack prevention, but as I've already said I almost never have panic attacks. I just uncomfortably teter on the edge of having one, nearly all the time. These exercises do not make me feel more relaxed, they do not stop my mind from thinking the way it does or the things it does. They do nothing for the fear or anxiety itself, they do nothing to help me gain confidence in my health and body. I've been going to him for 4 months, and this is not helping me. He's a nice guy and all but all he seems good for is recommending me vitamin supplements and breathing exercises. I think maybe he would do really well for people who feel everyday anxiety about normal things, like finances, relationships, parenthood, careers, etc. But I feel like this particular issues falls well outside the realm of ordinary anxiety, where taking a step back and breathing could be helpful. That external situations can be avoided, mitigated, and pose little to no mortal threat to anyone. My issue is all internal, where I can never escape my stressors. They're always thumping in my chest or cognizing in my skull or writhing and gurgling in my abdomen. If the things I worried about did come to pass, they would be of significant mortal threat. Do I legitimately believe I'm in danger of a heart attack? Probably not, no. I can be rational. But all the rationale in the world doesn't matter when your symptoms are still impacting your life, and your primitive lizard brain is telling you you're in danger of dying. And that's how it feels, every day I feel as though I may die, in spite of my doctors telling me I'm perfectly healthy. It's a part of my that I know is false but cannot ignore or overcome, and this counselor has done nothing to help me.

Should I drop this guy and try to get my doctor to refer me to a clinical psychiatrist? I'm at my wit's end, this has gone on for far too long. It's becoming unbearable. Should I just stick it out with this guy and keep hoping there will be a breakthrough somewhere? Maybe I'm not in the best position to judge him but every session with him has just felt like nonsense.",17May2019,1

I always tried to associate my condition as a symptom of my lifelong battle with depression. However, as my depression lessens each day (yay) I am more aware that it is something else entirely causing my trouble with eating. Today I learned my dad has an eating disorder. It seemed so shocking to ""catch"" him purging. Not just because he is my dad, but because of his age. This nudged me to admit to myself there is something bigger going on.

19,"Mental illness is awful - I wouldn't wish it on the worst person in the world. It has destroyed my family - my sister has spent her entire adult life in-and-out of homeless shelters, my brother committed suicide. 

Ten years ago, I was one of the most sought after people in the country in my field. Today... I don't even know who I am anymore.

Helping to remove the stigma is important. But there is something for important that requires media attention - access to quality care.

NYC has more police officers than America has psychiatrists. There are only about 28K psychiatrists in the entire country! There are about 36K police officers in the NYPD. 

There are 11.5 psychiatrists for every 100,000 people in the country. According to the American Association of Medical Colleges, hree out of five practicing psychiatrists today are over 55 years old and one out of every four is over 65 - retirements are outpacing new psychiatrists. The American Medical Association notes that 60% of US counties lack a single psychiatrist - including 80% of all rural counties. In rural counties just 590 psychiatrists serve more than 27 million Americans. Among different states the difference in supply can be striking: While there are more than 612 psychiatrists per 100,000 residents in New York, rural Idaho has less than one psychiatrist for every 100,000 people.

To make matters worse, Americans do not even have access to all of those 28K psychiatrists. Only about 55% of psychiatrists take insurance, according to a 2014 study published in the The Journal of the American Medical Association. The average for all health care professionals is around 89%. 57% of psychiatrists do not accept Medicaid and 55% do not accept Medicare.

If someone manages to access help, the help waiting for them is vile, disgusting, and dehumanizing. One company - Universal Health Services (UHS) - dominates the industry. A simple Google search will provide you with details of lawsuits and fines measured in the billions of dollars. I've been in two UHS facilities...

The first time was in 2016. I almost committed suicide the previous evening - I was desperate for help! The moments when you are willing to seek and/or accept help are fleeting. I looked for a provider that accepted my insurance and checked myself into a UHS hospital. Checking myself into that UHS facility was the second worst decision of my life.

Similar to when someone arrives at an ER, the first person I spoke to was the financial intake staffer. Before I had been evaluated by a medical professional, the intake staff informed me I would be there 8-days and I would need to pay the approximately $2,700 my insurance wouldn't cover. I was vulnerable and not thinking clearly. It was a Friday morning - I told them I didn't have $2,700, but I would after my next paycheck. They convinced me to give them my debit card and told me they wouldn't charge the card until next Friday. (Once you're in, they don't leave for 72-hours because of your mental state, but they have no quams about having you hand over your credit card).

Before I was taken upstairs to the main treatment facility, I had to change out of my clothes and into a set of paper-like scrubs. Once I was upstairs I sat in the community room for about four ours. No one spoke to me or gave me any guidance about what was going to happen next. 

During that approximately four period, there were two brutal fights between patients. I was scared - really scared! I asked one of the staff when I would be seen by a doctor. The staffer told me that the doctor had already come and gone for the day - and since it was a Friday, there would not be a doctor in-house back until Monday morning. At this point I asked to be discharged so I could go somewhere that would treat me today. The staffer laughed at me and informed me I could not leave for 72-hours. At this point I was given my civilian clothes to change into - minus my belt and shoelaces. This also coincideded with a shift change.

When the new shift came on duty, I was dressed in my everyday uniform - jeans and an untucked blue button down dress shirt. I tore the legs of the paper scrubs into long strips and made myself a belt and shoelaces. The new staff on duty was not interacting with any patients - they all remained in the lounge/break area.

I wanted to leave the facility. I wanted to leave and go somewhere that would help me now. If the would not let me leave, I thought I would force them to kick me out.

While the staff ignored the patients, I sat myself down at the nurses station - on the employee side. I reviewed the medical records off all the patients on the floor and I took a phone charger for a patient that had smuggled in cell phone. The entire time I was behind the counter, two cameras were focused on the exact spot I was sitting - with the monitors in the lounge/break area.

As I sat there, one of the patients came up to me and asked if she could get her anxiety medication - she was due and felt like she was going to have a panic attack. She and I continued to talk - I was just trying to distract her and keep her calm until the staff came out. Eventually she had a full-fledged panic attack. I got up did my best to comfort her - trying to get her to do some breathing. I then went behind the nurses station, knocked on the lounge door to get the attention of staff, and returned to the patient.

A nurse finally came over. The nurse looked at me and asked what was happening. I told her I thought the patient was having a panic attack and needed her meds. This is where things get really crazy. The nurse didn't budge - she looked at me, as if she was waiting for my directions. I looked the nurse in the eyes and directed her to bring 2 mg of Ativan and 50 mg intravenous Benedryl. The nurse went and brought back the medicine and asked me to sign some paper (I assume authorizing their use).

THE PROFESSIONAL STAFF ALL THOUGHT I WAS A NEW PHYSICIAN AT THE FACILITY.

After the patient receieved her meds, I went up to the nurse and asked to speak with her supervisor. She looked at me slightly confused - turned out she was the charge nurse. At this point I told her I was a patient.

There was a doctor on the floor about two hours later. But the physician wasn't there to treat anyone, he was called in specifically to threaten me. He brought me into one of the offices and, over about 10-minutes, he detailed how he could have me transferred to Anacostia, force me to be medicated, and hold me for weeks. He then told me I wasn't allowed out of my room for the remaining two days.

Before they discharged me on Monday, I was required to meet with the a group of five people - another physician, two attorneys, and two members of upper management. They asked me to tell them what happened - they said they wanted to make sure it didn't happen again. They wanted me to sign a document - I didn't read it - probably an NDA or waiver of future claims. I refused. They then explained to me that when someone files a complaint, their name and medical records becomes public and I would be forced to discuss my illness in open proceedings and that I would be subject to cross-examination. I knew that wasn't true, but I just wanted to go home.

When I arrived home Monday morning, I crawled into the shower and cried on the floor for hours. I didn't speak, turn the lights on, or open the door to my apartment for 43 days. I lost my job and was evicted.

I really can't write or talk much about the second time I was in a UHS facility. I had gotten a job in another state. Again, I was on the brink of suicide - I didn't think I could stop myself. I went to a specific ER because they have one of the best nueropsychiatric facilities in the nation. Unfortunatly, I had lost my health insurance six days earlier. As soon as they found out I was uninsured, they scheduled me to be transferred to a UHS facility.

I begged anyone who would listen not to send me there. They told me I had no choice. I pulled the hospital bed into the corner of the room - I thought if I had some more time I could convince them not to send me there. That's when they sent the police into the room. The only resistance I put up was holding onto the bed. They proceeded to beat the shit out of me. When I saw the police assembling I started an audio recording on the phone. It's 57-minutes of them beating and mocking me - clear as day on the recording. I begged for them not to do this to me. It was like I was drowning - I was begging and then threatening and then begging some more. I would have said anything not to be sent there - I would have admitted to the JFK assassination and planning 9/11 if it meant not going to a UHS facility. But, they sent me there anyway.

Since May of last year, I have only come out of my room four times. I haven't spoken more than 200 words. I'm pretty sure I am now suffering from PTSD - I spontaneously start crying nearly every day. Everything makes me angry. I'm not even sure I'm human anymore. 

This disease has taken everything from me. I will never again allow myself to be in proximity to anyone who is a mental health professional.7",17May2019,1

26,"I mean by normal standards i'm already pretty weird lol.

Anyways, I've been dealing with anxiety and depression for about 3ish years now. I have lots of issues with isolation, like socially, and just hiding away from people in general. 

Sometimes, more frequently recently, I just feel like I'm an inch away from completely losing it. Maybe it's stress or something idk, these next 2 weeks have a lot going on for me. Might also be worth mentioning that I do display some traits of paranoid schizophrenia (never diagnosed), not like hallucinations or anything, but constant worry, fear of being watched. i need to always check the house to make sure I'm the only one there. I have a pretty consistent suspicion that theres hidden cameras somewhere for the sole purpose of watching me (its irrational ik and have no evidence whatsoever to justify it). But i can't shake it. I feel like people watch and judge me and I fear a lot that they may hurt me (again, no real way to justify this thought).

I was just outside laying down looking at the stars, which was calming and is something  I've enjoyed doing for a while now. But another part of me just wanted to just run into the woods and turn into a complete lunatic. Idk, i feel like I can just flip a switch in my mind between completely normal, and borderline psycho. It's hard to explain. I think if drank some alcohol I'd flip that switch and god knows where I'd end up. But I don't really entertain that idea much. I'd give more details if i could but idk how to. I've never really dove fully into it to see what happens. 

I'm dealing with college graduation, extreme pressure from parents to find a good job, pressure of knowing that I won't be able and that my parents are gonna be pissed, my sisters wedding which i'm very nervous about because of my anxiety. I'm losing my one job in like 3 days (business closing). Idk, sometimes it gets to be so much to deal with on top of my already bad mental issues.

I just told my family today which is a few days before I would supposedly graduate (I felt afraid to tell them even before but holding it in made me feel worse and hurt everyone else in the end). When I told them about my lie they asked me why and I did not know what to say and I can't comprehend why I do this. I feel like lying has trickled down to everything else I do. Since then I have pushed away things and just blatantly lied but not feeling anything afterwards, just that I need to push on and hope things will get better.

So I'm a 16yo man. I'm pretty normal person from the outside *(I done fine in the school etc.)*. The only thing I think is that I haven't had any friends outside from school for many years. But in recent year, I  have seen about myself quite serious things that nobody would expect from me:

I have recently been interested in child pornography. I have no idea why. I've watched it a couple of times already and I do not feel sorry, even though I know that it is wrong. I also noticed that I hate most of the women. I think they are whores. Sometimes I also feel that I should rape and kill some annoying women in a painful way. If I would not get caught, I would already have done it. And a few things more related to this.

You may now think that wtf. Well, I think the same way. Most of the time I think that all these actions/thoughts are really sick and nobody should do/experience them. I am against them. But when I suddenly get into that ""state"", I think it's normal. A bit like two different personality.

I dare not go talking about this to anyone, because the resulting consequences would probably be quite big(?). And this is actually the first time I tell someone about this. So what's wrong with me?",17May2019,1

32,"Hey guys, 

It's been a while since I had this problem. I'm currently a sophomore in high school but I think I've had it since 8th grade(I've fixed some things, but some aspects have gotten worse rip).

I have a habit of considering some areas of the house ""clean"" and others ""dirty""?? so to speak. I'm not even sure how to put it into words, and I know I'm being ridiculous, but I can't seem to get rid of the habit. After I take showers and whatnot, I consider everything ""clean"" to be okay to touch but not anything ""dirty"", and if it's been about a day without showering or something like that, I can go to ""dirty"" areas,  but avoid ""clean"" ones like the plague smh. 

I used to even wash my phone in 8th grade because of this habit?? but after it got waterdamaged, I just wipe it down with a damp paper towel (but I still use some dish soap, even though I know it's bad for my phone)

It's really pissing my sister off since it's gotten to the point that I can't even go into my room sometimes, and I have to ask her to get me stuff when I can't go to certain places. I also get really stressed when she puts anything ""dirty??"" on my desk(which, idk why, but I consider to be a ""clean""er area), and at one point in 9th grade, my mom told me to go to sleep without a shower and to shower in the morning instead since it was late, but I ended up crying since I was in a ""clean"" area, and it messed up my \*\*unreasonable\*\* routine??(idk what to call this habit)

I used to shower about twice a day, and it kinda killed my family's water bill(we also live in CA, so it made it even worse), but nowadays I sometimes avoid keeping up with proper hygiene just so I can stick to ""dirty"" areas when I need to get stuff done. Ik it's gross, but idk what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone possibly give me any tips on how to break this habit? I know I'm being ridiculous, but I can't seem to break this way of thinking.

Hello everyone,

I am here seeking help for my one and only brother. I apologize if I haven’t posted this in the correct section- but if anyone can suggest a better place for this post it would be greatly appreciated.

Just some background: currently my brother is in his mid 40’s living at home with my mother and father. He has his own room, and a huge separate living room that is mainly empty which he is in throughout most of the day. That room only contains a computer, desk, and his chair. He is in this room from approx 12-14 hours maybe longer each day(some days shorter). He will come downstairs to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner which my mother usually provides. When he has his meals he has it on his own in a separate room away from my parents or myself when I lived there or when visiting. He likes being on his own. But when my family does have a larger gathering, he will have dinner with everyone and interact though.

In the past he has worked with my parents close to 15+ years ago in the family business. He was also married for 1.5 years also 15+ years ago. The girl was someone my parents introduced and at the time being the old fashioned parents they are, they wanted him to get married and start a family( I’m guessing he was prob about 22-25 yo at the time).

So the marriage didn’t last (they got divorced, no kids) and my family shut down the business but managed to live off of rental properties - so working to survive wasn’t a must. Since then (about 15 years) he will work here and there. Initially he took a couple years off, then went back to find a job and work for 10 months for example, then ends up getting fired or leaving, and then takes a few months off and does the same thing all over again. This time he’ll work 3 months for example and then take 7 months off. You get my point. He graduated high school but never pursued college. He never had interest in trade schools either. 

After the divorce my parents put a lot of blame on themselves and didn’t get involved and let him be. Eventually as years passed, they would say he should find someone again and would introduce someone and sometimes he’d go out on one date and it wouldn’t work.

There have been many fights in the past regarding his behavior and his failure to communicate. Since nothing has come from it, these past few years my parents have just let him be to keep the peace.

As I said earlier, if he’s not working that day and is at home, he is secluded for the majority of the day. He will very briefly communicate with parents saying hi/bye and minor things that happened in his day but he’s always in a rush to get to his room or computer and avoid communication.

My mother has written him many letters as have I. We’ve left phone numbers of help hotlines/therapists but nothing changes. I was out of state for school for a while and once I got back before getting married and leaving the house again I wrote him a letter telling him how much I love him and how I want to have a relationship with him and suggested going to some type of event and that I would get the tickets. A few days later he called the house phone when he wasn’t home and asked my mother to speak to me. He told me he loved me but that he doesn’t want to have that type of relationship with me and that he enjoys being alone and enjoys his life this way. He told me all of this over the phone as he does not like to communicate in person and if it is in person... we are communicating when his door is shut. No face to face contact.

My parents and I are in desperate need to help my brother out of what he is in and has been for the past 20 years. I’ve asked therapists and others and they’ve all told me to leave him alone and that it is his decision.

What can we do? Do I bring someone to our home and have them try to talk to him? How do we try to fix this? He also has paranoia and fear issues. For example, when my mother and I were out, he called me frantically wanting to speak to our mother. He asks my mom if she is feeling ok and if anything happened to her earlier that day and if she’s sure she’s ok. In addition I’ve heard him get angry and talk to himself when he’s in his room cursing at something. Sometimes making noise like throwing stuff. Not sure what gets him super angry.

Please anyone please give me a suggestion I would appreciate it. What does this sound like to you? Anyone know? Do I bring a therapist to my parents house and have some type of intervention? We don’t want him to completely check out and do something from the pressure of us. Do we install some type of camera to see what’s going on? I forgot to mention he also has some microphones outside installed bc he was hearing things from our neighbor...we don’t know if he also possibly wants to snoop and hear what my parents are talking about.....


Anyone know what he’s suffering from? How do you help someone who clearly doesn’t want help. Please help any suggestions is appreciated. Thanks for reading",17May2019,7

I am about to sit exams at the end of medical school in about a month and they will affect the rest of my life. I feel like I am actually having some type of breakdown right now because of his breakups and now we are broken up and not together and he is ignoring me. He says he is too stressed for a relationship. Six months ago he cheated on me and did this throughout our entire relationship and when I saw a psychologist she said that he seemed like a covert narcissist. Part of me wonders whether he is doing this on purpose to hurt me. Right now I can't work, eat or sleep and I feel like throwing up all the time. I just can't believe he would do this to me. I haven't done any work at all for a week and then the last time he broke up with me I was unable to work for about 2 weeks. How do I mentally get through this and not ruin my whole future.

45,"Apologies in advance for the long post!

Over a year ago I was dealing with some pretty bad anxiety and depression, which was caused by work stress, and a toxic relationship I was in, which wouldn't shift, no matter how hard I tried. I'd dealt with it before that, but it was always pretty manageable, and got better eventually, without needing medication etc. So after about 4/5 months of feeling like constantly, I'd decided to seek help with the way I was feeling, I'd always felt quite nervous of trying to get help and not being taken seriously.

After seeing a doctor, he was very understanding, and I was prescribed 20mg Fluoxetine, which after a few weeks improved my mood a lot, and it continued to do so for the 3 months after. I had pretty good support from a few close friends over it, although I had never told my family.. Which after seeing improvements (feeling the best I had in years,) decided to tell my parents. It caused arguments between my parents, my father got pretty angry with me over me being on it, and my mother got very upset. Neither really understood why I felt that way, even though I had plenty of reasons, but after a day or two, calmed down.

Now, after things had settled, my father never spoke about it again, which to be honest, I didn't mind. He's always been a manly man, so I don't expect to talk about feelings with him. It was always more about me getting it off of my chest, so that I didn't have to sneak around hiding medication etc. My mother on the other hand started casually making sarcastic comments about it to me, going as far as to call me crazy, or there's something wrong with me if I was having a bad day etc. I didn't really appreciate that, and it started to irritate me, I had told her this, but she kept making them anyway.. We are going on holiday in a few months, we had a conversation about it and insurance came up, she told me how much it was, which sounded unreasonably high, so I asked.. Apparently it's incase I have a 'manic' episode, or lose it when I'm away, and she'd told them that. I've never had a manic episode, or 'lost it,' it's depression I've suffered with. I don't exactly know where it came from, so I was a bit taken back and annoyed at that point. I completely regret telling them in the first place.. My mothers a good person, but I don't understand why she's been like this at all.

So, after numerous comments and jabs over it over the two months after telling them, I came off of my medication. I thought they can have it their way, if me being on medication is that big of a deal to them. I know that coming off without the help of a doctor is advised against, but I had tried to book some appointments to get seen, but couldn't get any.. Since then it's been about 2 months since then, I felt fine at the start, but since then I've felt my mood getting worse this last month. My mothers commented on it, but I've brushed it off, because I'm not going there again.

So to ask a question or two, is it worth going back to the doctors over this, or just riding it out at this point? &amp; Has anyone else had issues with their parents over being on medication?",17May2019,2

48,"Being off facebook has been much better for me! Social Media can cause some great deals of distress for me, especially facebook. 

Anytime I saw a humorous post (for example say a ""meme""). regarding and sexually related things trigger terrible thoughts and emotions. 

I was always checking the statistics of the 6 different reactions (who liked, loved, laughed, wowed, sad and agried it). 

Also the comments, any post I would always be checking the comments and this day and age. 

Especially anxiety with numbers because nowadays, for example lets say a Major League Sports Team Page of your local or hometown team. (Example, Boston Bruins)

The Page could have 100k followers and posts often with around 10k likes and about thousand or so comments with even comments now that if not a hundred or more, could have a thousand or so reactions along with a dozen other comments on the post. 

These numbers often do cause anxiety for me and that is why my facebook account is set to be terminated as of Sunday May 19, 2019.

I live in an apartment with my boyfriend in the city but on weekends he often go back to the suburbs to see his mom and friends so I spend the weekend alone. I don't  why but one weekend I just started stressing really bad that if someone was about to break in I couldn't do anything about it. 

Then it got worse, I closed all the curtains but the curtains in my bedroom are somewhat see through. Yet I'm sure it's impossible to see inside my room from the street especially when all the lights are closed but I just couldn't tell myself that and I didn't want to go in my room at all.

I was texting my boyfriend saying I was scared. I googled how many crimes have happened on my street (only one car robbery since 2010 and that's it). Like I live in a Canadian city on a very nice street it all made no sense. But at that time I was sure I was going to die. 

I ended up taking two sleeping pills because I still couldn't sleep after one and crashing on the couch because I couldn't go in my room.

54,"I'm so tired of people treating me like a child. I have social phobia, which means I'm typically quiet, and when I do talk, I might stumble over or forget words. My brain works on overdrive, and it can be hard to focus. 
And I think people think I am stupid. Even if they know about my phobia, and they are supposed to be trained to work with people like me. 

I had an appointment with my handler at the unemployment office today. She talked to me like I was a child. When I stumbled over words, she would raise her eyebrows or roll her eyes. She then went on to explain social phobia to me, in a manner you would explain it to a child. I have been diagnosed for over 13 years. I think I know enough about by now. 

She is not the first to treat me like I am somehow not an adult because I have anxiety and panic attacks.  It feels so degrading. I am an adult. I'm not stupid, nor immature.

I think some people think in they are being considerate, and are just trying to make me feel comfortable, not realizing that I am a person under the layers of paralyzing fear, that just wants to be treated like everyone else. Singling me out as different is exactly what I don't want, nor need. I want to be normal. I am normal. Just with a side of panic attacks.
Treating me as I am different does me no favors. It doesn't make me feel comfortable enough to open up to you, and it only highlights my struggle.
I can't move past it if you keep shoving it in my face.

I'm just so tired of people not understanding that I am a person, and an adult at that. That I'm not all that different. That it is not only okay, but expected of you, to speak to me like you'd speak to anyone else. Because that is what I am. I don't want, nor need, special treatment.

56,"Today I went to school like every day. But first a little backstory: 
I am a very emotional person. I was never good at any subject but English. I also never had a great personality or anything like that. So I am always trying hard on getting good grades for my parents even though I knew I' m good at anything. At school I am known as the depressed and insane kid. Every day feels like another one in hell because I have no one to go to. No friends at all. And me and my parents argue A LOT. I really want to die from time to time. 

So I went to school and got a test back. It was English and I had a D on it. I never had a D on my English work so I was SO DISAPPOINTED. I sat down in the hallway and cried my eyes out like usually would because things like that hit me hard.. I had again realised that I can' t do anything right and was disappointing everyone around me for the rest of my life. A human without friends or a great personality. 

Suddenly a teacher came up to me (they usually don' t care about me anymore because they are sick of it) and she sat down with me. She looked at me, said my name and put her hand on my shoulder. I was surprised she knew my name. She wanted me to tell her what was wrong, and I couldn' t keep it in. I told her everything from how my parents and I would only argue and yell at eachother to how I had no friends and bad grades. I really felt like I have achieved nothing in my life and only brought pain to those around me. But she said something that made me cry even more and also made me happier again: 

""You don' t need to make your parents proud. You don' t need friends and you don' t need good grades right now. What you need is some good words and your confidence back. I think you have lost hope and stopped believing in the things you do and like. I think, you have started believing the terrible things your parents tell you. 
What you need to start having in your mind again is, that you are strong and you deserve to be loved. You can do anything. Even if the world tells you the opposite. And it does feel like that, right? You can become anything and you can be the person you wish to be.""

It has been 3 hours now since that has happend. And I feel a little more confident. And I want all of the people who ""suffer"" the same way I do to take the teachers word and remember it.

I just feel so... confined. I was hoping I would finally speak for myself and I'd have my privacy respected, be validated and receive treatment. But at the same time I'm just questioning if I'm exaggerating it and demanding I get a mental illness diagnosis.

I also hate my Autism so fucking much right now. It feels like it's blocking every chance of my validity. If I'd know that in a possible next life I'd be normal, I'd totally kill myself. Hell, I'd kill myself regardless.

Title mostly says it all. In my personal experience, and between those who I have asked about this, it seems that a lot of people us feel that way and have experienced those traumas tend to be impulsively sexual as a means of coping with negative feelings or those events. I've also found that more often than not, in regards to the topic, some people like this will engage in more risky behavior as well.

This is putting a huge strain on our friendship because her problems seem to be the only that matter.

The first time I got angry at him was because I had to wait for him 20 minutes as he was late. The next week I got upset because I had to take an hour long busride and he didn't want to meet halfway. Today I got angry at his voice not sounding ""happy enough"", it was the last straw for me to realize it doesn't matter what he does, it's me that's the problem.

For as long as i could remember, I was always extremely self aware and self conscious and had no self esteem. It could get to the point where I wouldn’t even be able to see cause I’d be so in my head, almost like in another world. Something I’m learning more through my days is that a decent amount of people find me attractive and show signs of interest and just generally like me. My point with that isn’t to sound egotistical. Cause literally my whole life and even now I see myself as below most people so don’t take it that way. But I just don’t see any appeal. And like literally every girl I work with is into me. 80% of the girls my age who I deal with through my job always act nervous or shy or just seem attracted to me. And it’s just weird to think that that’s a possibility. In any case my point with this is throughout my life all the signs I’ve read off of other people acted as a confirmation for me as to how I’m acting and where my place is in the world etc.... and I’m curious to know that is it possible that the reason I’ve always felt this way is because people are just generally intimidated by me? I’m not trying to be cocky or anything. I’ve just been told that enough times to know that people generally feel that way with me in one way or another. And I’ve always been awkward because most people always seemed to act weird towards me and as a result I became a quiet introvert who was scared
Of everything. 
And ever since I’ve been working on changing that, everything seems amazing. Life goes me way. The girl I want likes me too. I get a lot of positive affirmation from others. And I’m starting to develop a personality and confidence and I love it. But I just don’t think I’m  good looking enough for that to be the issue. But now I’m being told things I’ve never heard in my life from many people and I feel like my brains starting to change literally. 
I’m not even sure what the point of this post truly was but I guess the short version could be something like ; could everything I perceived about myself be wrong? Could I have misinterpreted facial expressions and reactions from others as something I did wrong? And because of how sure I was I was a problem, is it possible that I actually did come off a certain way to people due to my internalization of these thoughts? Or has my life just been miserable for years all due to blaming myself always whenever someone acted iffy towards me?

69,"I am 25 now. For many years I have felt pretty 'empty' emotionally, except for brief periods of ""self-realisation""; but then I revert to the mean baseline feeling of emptiness pretty shortly after. 

I can only describe this prevailing feeling as a sense of isolation, low energy, and low enthusiasm for being alive. If I could choose, I would choose to have never been born, absolutely.

It's different from depression, which is an overused word. I do enjoy reading, and I like learning. The problem is I have to work for a living, which sucks up all my energy and enthusiasm for life. It always hangs over me. I have entrepreneurial visions but can't muster enough energy after a day's work to pursue them.

I don't have low testosterone or anything that, as a man, I should be concerned about. I am relatively healthy, probably around 15% body fat although I'm losing weight and want to get leaner. I am visibly athletic (more muscle than average) and walk to work.

There are parts of life I like, but I just don't have any energy or enthusiasm anymore. No drive or feeling of ambition that I had when I was, say, 18 and younger.

For example, I would like to have a family one day. But with my level of energy, that just couldn't work. I isolate myself. I dislike being around people. I don't want people to see me frankly (except family). I just... wish I didn't exist. But I'm not depressed, sad, or anything like that... I don't feel sad, I just see everything as pretty much pointless.

I'm not so much a nihilist either. I do feel like my life is meaningful in some ways, I just don't feel the energy and will to seize and exploit that meaning, and fully experience it. I might go on a trip with my family, but the next day forget where we actually went, because in the moment my mind was just... empty. I wasn't feeling the moment, just viewing my environment as it changed.

This is how I live. Whether I'm at home, work, or somewhere else; I'm just 'there'. I'm socially inattentive, and indeed inattentive about most things. I'm just physically present, but mentally vacant. I have no emotional attachment to anything. If my whole family died I would be sad, but it wouldn't affect me as much as it ""should"".

She had attended some amount of therapy, but she doesn't believe that she has a problem, so she doesn't stay on her medication, and doesn't regularly attend therapy.

“What we’re seeing is alarming,” says study co-author  Donna Ruch, a researcher with the Research Institute at Nationwide  Children’s Hospital in Ohio. “On top of the fact that females are  thinking about suicide more and attempting suicide more, now they’re  actually completing suicide.”",17May2019,1
87,"Hi i jist need someone to give me a vague idea of whats going on. Im experiencing symptoms i never have before and I don't know what it means. 

I have been suffering from some sort of pts (d) for the last 7 years bit only realised it as more than just depression  about 4 years ago. It stems from growing up with an emotionally unstable mother and verbal abuse that sometimes got physical. My mother struggles woth motherhood and ot was worst in very early childhood (1-4). I was parentalized in my early teens and experienced some sexual abuse in my early teens as well. 

Usually my symptoms are hypervigilance leading to anxiety and stretches of dissociation. I used to fantasize about self harm a lot but have only given in a handful of times. Everything is very introverted so my anxiety attacks are silent, i just sort of act normal or switch off verbally while im panicking on the inside. It comes with a side effect of outbursts of lack of control when triggered. (Banging my head against the wall, hitting myself or objects) releasing the extreme tension sort of like a bowstring. Its accompanied by theses vivid intrusive thoughts on how to hurt myself. I am not really a crying and shaking kind of person so its all very undetected by people around me. Although i have experienced that as well. (Screaming crying shaking hyperventilating)

Recently everything has gotten more intense.  I am ancious almost every day to the point of shaking hands which is a big deal for me. I am forgetful and scattered which is especially annoying at work and i have stress dreams or cant fall asleep at all. I seem to struggle woth speaking clearly as im so tense and overstressed and jumble my words. I cant take in any information and have to ask people to repeat themselves all the time. During arguments my intrusive thoughts are also so much worse and vivid and by myself i even have started getting suicidal ideals ( ""ypu dont have a place in this world"" ""theyd be better off without you"") even though i have never wanted and never will want to kill myself.

Last week i was particularily stressed and took a shower with the lights off as i thought it could be relaxing. There was still light coming through the bottom of the door and at some point it looked to me as if there was a shadow before the door (as if someone had walked past it). I tried to shrug it off as i had been kind of seeing ""tricks of the eye"" from now and then because i was so tired. Bit this was a little different i think. More realistic. I stared at the door to double check and then i saw the shadow in the corner of the room move. Move as in just shift weird. Im sure it was just my brain miscalculation but it did freak me out. Then another day i walked into the kitchen to get me and my girlfriend some ice cream and i had this nice feeling of content and love which is noticed and almost immediately as a response i had this strong thought of ""shame its the last time in a long time you have this"" like a cheesy movie forshadowing. 


I thinks thats all that has been a new thing so please if you have felt similar let me know. Please dont just advise me to got to therapy. I will fo that as soon as its available to me but before i need some vague idea of whats going on so i can verbalize it to a professional. Im awful at talking about myself face to face.",17May2019,1

89,"I’m climbing out of a long, hard depression that’s been in the making for a couple years now. Because of this, I’ve lost friends along the way because i’ve been distant or changed (i think mostly for the better) but whenever my bf and i talk about friends, i feel like i’m throwing a pity party for myself because i don’t have really anyone to even talk to, other than him. and then i get upset (with myself) when he talks about his best friends and even when we talk about wedding parties, who is going to be his groomsmen and i just sit and think “ok, i’ll have my...... dog as a bridesmaid i guess..” idk it makes me feel kind of stupid.",17May2019,11
90,"So I'm a bit of an odd case, I can read people very easily and feel shame rather easily too, however when it comes to caring for others, I just can't. I don't have many friends because I don't feel like pretending to give a crap about them. When someone makes a post online about them feeling bad, I try to make it all about me. If I made someone sad, I only really feel bad if they're pretty. In relationships, I only want to be there for the sex, not actually wasting my time with them. Recently Mother's Day came around, my mother wanted me to come down and spend some time with her (I live two stories above her) but I couldn't bring myself to care enough and finally came down around 6pm. She wasn't mad at all, just really sad and the worst part was I couldn't have given a bigger shit. I couldn't hug her, tell her I'm sorry. It just didn't feel natural. All I could do was try to joke my way out of it, which usually works pretty good. I've read online about Narcissists, Psychopaths, and Sociopaths and I don't think I fall into those categories, if I did why would I post about this here? Can someone tell me why I'm like this? I love myself, I wouldn't change anything about me, because I'm perfect. However I need to fix this part if I ever want to maintain a basic relationship with anyone.",17May2019,2
91,"I'm getting really desperate. No one I've talked to denied there's a problem but no one has pin pointed what the problem is. I've been given parts of a diagnosis - psychosis, depression, anxiety - but no actual disorder that it all amounts to. My therapist referred me back to the GP but they don't know what to do. In fact they asked me what I want them to do! I've spent 2 years suffering and searching for answer and for help but I can't seem to find anything. And now I don't even have a therapist. I don't know what to do, I'm sorry if I'm going off on a rant here but I'm beginning to lose hope. 

I'm battling psychotic episodes in which I hear, feel, see and believe things that others don't and that aren't based on fact. I go on spending sprees, try to contain my racing thoughts in the notebooks I fill up with pages of nonsensical writing. I am at the height of my sexuality and creativity, and I often pick up the basics of languages but then I forget everything I learnt once I plummet. And I always plummet. And then the depression comes and I don't leave my house for weeks on end, I forget to eat, lose the interest and the capacity I need to complete any basic task. And what even is hygiene? I always relapse into self harm and I don't even understand why I do it. I'm so aware of how much of a burden I am on my family. And the worse thing is I'm aware of all that's going on But I cannot stop it, it's like my mind has been severed from my body and all I can do is watch as I ruin myself.

How long on average does it take to find the right help?",17May2019,1

93,"Hey everyone!  


I'm a pretty avid poster, I really like giving advice to people struggling seeing as I like to believe I'm somewhat a good counsel. However, this time, I'm in sore need of some sort of guidance.  


I've been in and out of therapy for many years, and for the last years I've moved home, basically alienated all of my friends since moving away and going sober, and missed out on high school since I wasn't ever able to finish. I'm 23 now, haven't had a job in years. All of this has left me pretty isolated and hungry for getting back into actually living, getting a education and girlfriend and all of that shit. I had a pretty solid plan to move out after this summer, since my therapist had gotten me into a hospitalization with treatment directed specifically towards people in my situation, that is, people with anxiety and depression.  


I'll just say that I'm sorry if this all comes out jumbled, I have to take breaks because I just get filled with frustration and rage.   


Well, my therapist sent my application to late. I hoped to get into this treatment on Monday, but they told me that there wasn't room, but they would be happy to have me in September. This pretty much broke me, somehow. I was so sure I was going to get in, I had absolutely everything planned. Be there through summer, get better, finally move out again, and start taking up courses to finish high school while trying to get into a tune.   


Now, my life is basically postponed again. After being postponed, and postponed, and postponed. I fucking hate living with my parents, I fucking hate where I'm at, I fucking hate myself and what my life has become. I just don't know if I'll be able to be here till Autumn, I can't reach my therapist till Monday (and I've already left her a message to call me), I feel like I am going to lose my mind or explode. The feeling of rage and frustration is seriously so much to handle right now, that I just ""combust"" internally before I slump back into bed. I can't even watch a series, or play a game, or read, or do anything before I just give up. I can talk to my parents of course, but it would be pointless as they can't do anything to help, and right now they are more or less a manifestation of my rage, so I'm afraid I'll just flip out at them if they even tried giving advice.  


I know all of this sounds incredibly pathetic. I don't know if I should just move, just so that something happens. Or if I should stay till Autumn and hope I don't kill myself while waiting. I simply don't know what I'm going to do.",17May2019,4
94,"Alright so today finally after a long time of going to see phycristry and doctor and tying a fuck ton of different mood meds with them doing all jingle of stuff. They have finally diagnosed me with BPD today. As a result my phycristry has reference me to a group tearpy session that 6 months long and waiting for new from of therapy. Thing the session are 6 months and right now their one going so I have to wait till fall for the next one to start. 

It was suggested that I go read up on bpd and do research on how to help control my mood and emotion. So I'm asking for anyone who is bpd. What has help you. How do you control the explosive anger and the intense emotion that seem to come out of no where. How do you keep yourself from blowing a situation out of probation  that really isn't all that bad. And your just over reacting.

I know there a subreddit for bpd I'm probably gonna make my way their at some point. I just thought the mental health page be a good place to start.",17May2019,2

I really want to talk to a therapist about my (24F) and my boyfriend (26M)’s issues (depression, anxiety and probably bipolar disorders). However our finance is not really good as I have been preparing the money to submit my visa to the UK in couple of months and for my course in September.

I do not know who I really am, I don’t feel connected to any of my friends, even my boyfriend who loves me feels completely foreign to me. I feel like I don’t know my best friend who I clicked with more than anyone in my life. I feel completely disoriented and dissociative. 

I walked outside and sat on the bench. I looked around. Still nothing feels real. Sound is strange. I am very very scared and uncomfortable. 

I do not want to feel like this I am really really scared. I saw my therapist yesterday and am going to dbt tomorrow.",17May2019,1
98,"Hello Reddit, I have posted here before but i feel like Im at a crossroad in my life where i need to figure some things out and dont know where else to post it.

So for some context first: I just recieved a certificate for Aircraft Maintenance engineering through post secondary, but its not what I want to do. I did the program because my parents basically told me I had to. They were the ones paying for my school so anything they didnt want me to do was off the table. Including my #1 option, and passion in the form of Journalism.

Anyway, I dont want to be an aircraft maintenance engineer. I dont care about money, I care about being happy. I dont plan to have kids or a family ever. I want to do journalism. I can afford to put myself through the schooling completely, without needing loans. The cost to me will be the relationship with my parents. 

I suppose my question is, do i risk my relationship with my parents, and pursue my dreams, or live a life of mediocrity while making lots of money, and keep my parents happy? And how do I handle the situation? 

I know this is horribly written and formatted but im on mobile in my car in a parking lot in the rain and emotional after just having a fight with my mom so its bad.",17May2019,1
99,"My friend in question is a 17 year old, turning 18 in September. i'm going to list some things he has do done along with the way he feels in general. My friend in question has always known he was different but up until recently he started saying he has APSD.

When my friend was younger, he was for the most part neglected and emotionally abused by his mom. His dad he only saw once every week. Around 7th grade was when he found himself started to have different behavior than others. Here are some of the things he has done that leads me to believe he has apsd.

In 7th grade, There was a girl at our school who was obviously different and very emotionally unstable. My friend wrote this girl a note asking her out to our school dance. He didn't have any plan of actually going with her though. The girl went to the dance and was held up by my friend. She went to the school counselor and told her about what my friend had done and he had gotten a lunch detention or something. The girl was so upset that when she would see my friend in the hallways she would cry and the only way he could react was with anger because the crying annoyed him. My friend told me till this day he still doesn't feel bad.

Taking a look at my friends relationship with his grandma and it's quite a mess. He has been fully cussing her out and calling her horrible names since the 6th grade. In the 8th grade the relationship totally changed when he started smoking weed. He then began to completely use her for money. He would lie about anything to get money. When my friend got caught smoking, his parents told his grandma he cant have money anymore. Since 10th grade to now currently (11th) my friend has stolen at least 2000$ from his grandma. often he just reaches into her purse when she is right next to him. He will steal sometimes up to 300$ at a time. He also has been emotionally abusing his grandma since the 8th grade.

Go back to 7th grade. i would go fishing with my friend and what he would do to catch fish was absolutely inhumane. He would catch bluegill, literally cut them in half while they were still alive with a rock and then use them as bait. it was honestly one of the strangest things i have ever witnessed.

10th grade was a very dark place for my friend. One time his Best friend since elementary school and when this happened best friend had a prescription of Vicodin. my friend had texted his best friend saying that he had someone who would buy the whole thing and that since my friend drove he could come get it. My friend took the prescription and kept it for himself. He had told his friend that his mom found it and even went to the extent of turning off his phone for a couple days to play it off like he's grounded.

My friend told me that the only time he had ever felt empathy was during a mushroom trip he had in the 9th grade.

More recently my friend ( who also happens to be my neighbor) has taken part in a new hobby. Last week, i saw him in his backyard walking around like he was looking for something. I didn't think much of it so i stopped watching but the next day i saw him doing the same thing so i decided to watch longer. Soon to realize i saw what he was doing. The sick fuck was literally throwing rocks at birds as hard as he could. Some in trees and some in bird feeders. The next thing i watched makes me sick. There was a bird that was clearly not right because it wasn't flying. The fucker grabbed a large stick and wacked the bird out of the push as hard as he could and when it was on the ground suffering he threw a rock at it.

There are many more things my friend has done but i don't wanna rant.. he scares me and i dont know what to do.",17May2019,0

104,"So basically, my whole life I’ve had two sides: my normal, socially acceptable side and my weird fringe personality. I do normal stuff. I play videos games and instruments. I watch tv and do sport. And then there’s the weird stuff. I’m obsessed with numbers 2 4 and 8. I cut up animal organs and I find some pain satisfying. I write sentences upon sentences of stuff that only makes sense to me when it shouldn’t. The doctors keep changing their diagnosis and therefore my meds, from anxiety and depression to acute aspd to autism and it just keeps on spiralling. Everyday is worse. My mind sounds like a film full of people talking but you can’t make out the words. I don’t know if I’ve got a legit mental issue or if it just seems that way because I’m so weird. I don’t know.

106,"Hi there. I'd like to know if there are people here who have had experiences with social anxiety and therapy. I know my problems and I think I know what I'd need to do to solve them (I just don't), so I am not sure what professional help (in whatever form it may take) could even do for me. 

I am cripplingly shy. Just today, I came up with a new plan for myself. Usually, I avoid brick &amp; mortar stores like the plague, especially those that have tiny spaces with staff in them who do not currently have any shelves to fill, so they just stand there and wait for potential customers to annoy. I hate having to talk to them, so I buy most everything online. But today, I thought I would force such a situation and maybe even make this a regular practice. So I stood in front of the store, then I moved away for fear of making people inside wonder why it's taking me so long to come in, then I moved past the store again, and then I definitely could not go in because at that point I had passed there twice, so surely everyone must assume I'm some sort of weirdo who can't make up his mind about what he wants. 

And what if I had gone through with it? I would not have been able to express my thoughts clearly and coherently, I would have tripped over my tongue trying to form sentences, I would have been caught off guard by sales peoples' questions, and in the end I would have bought something I didn't even want just to have a reason to escape the situation. Utterly pointless. 

I know I should do it anyway, and I know I should do such things often, but I just don't. If I can't make myself do it, how could others do it? What is there to gain from seeking professional help? 

The real goal is to be able to talk to girls btw, but hey. I am light years away from that. 

Thanks for reading, and maybe someone can tell me something I didn't think of myself..?",17May2019,1

117,"First off, I'm only 22. I've been diagnosed with ADHD, MDD, GAD, SAD, and PTSD. So, basically, I am borderline crazy.

What just happened to me, was the most scariest, but very weird experience I have ever had in my life.

I laid down for 30 secs on my bed, eyes shut. Planned on napping.

After 30 secs, my legs started feeling weird, but In a good way. It's like when your on a rollercoaster and you get that body feeling as you fall. I think people say it's when you feel your vibrations that your body has.

Anyways, after starting at my legs, it spread to basically my whole body, so I panicked, and sat up. I thought it was weird.

Then i laid back down, 15 secs pass this time and it happens same way, same feeling. I sit back up, thinking what the hell is happening?

So I laid back one more time, closed my eyes, and instantly almost the feeling came and overwhelmed it. I tried to ignore it as long as I could, but since the longer it last the more intense I felt it, so after 45 secs, I sit up and open my eyes.

And I wasn't even in my room anymore. I don't know where I was. All I know is I was like in a forest of dead trees, and It was very dark. This was not a dream. I never went to sleep.

So, while I'm literally so damn scared of what's happening, I noticed the feeling of vibrating went away. So I decided to just lay back again and close my eyes, and then I again felt the vibrations for just a second until I opened my eyes, and I was now in my room.

I can lay down now and the vibrations don't come, so now I can actually take a nap, but I just wanted to know what could cause this.

I have never hallucinated in my life, It wasn't a dream, I am not schizophrenic.

Please someone give me an idea of what happened.

118,"5 weeks ago I started to become unraveled. I had a little breakdown which ended a relationship. I planned on ending it anyway but I was more concerned about the state of my mental health. I had self destructive behavior for several weeks at this point. 

4 weeks ago I saw my therapist and unloaded. I've been binging and purging. I felt out of control and was using alcohol to numb the pain. She seemed taken aback since we mostly only ever spoke about relationships but I told her she could refer me elsewhere if need be. She gave me some mindfulness techniques but said she'd have to do some research on eating disorders. 

3 weeks ago I had some travel for work I had to do so I wasnt seeing me therapist that week. When I returned from my trip I checked on my dad who I care for (he lived alone and was very independent. I just did shopping and kept him company). I found him dead on his bathroom floor. The medical examiner said he probably passed 2 to 3 days prior. This was an extremely traumatic event for me. 

2 weeks ago I saw my therapist again. I immediately tell her about my dad and and she again was at a loss for words for a bit but let me get everything out I needed to. We again spoke a lot on mindfulness and she assured me my greif anxiety was normal considering. She had some some research on eating disorders and gave me some paperwork to read, mostly about tracking my food intake. 

Last week I saw her again. We spoke mostly of my dad, mindfullness and meditation. I've tried meditation, I've done it many times before but I find myself just getting into crying fits. I'm having a really hard time getting over the imagery of finding him. I feel like I have a lot going on and I don't feel like anything I'd getting better. Is it too soon? Do I need to enlist the help of someone else?",17May2019,1
119,"First time writing this down, please be patient with me.

My entire life i've always had trouble making and keeping friends. I grew up very lonely, and i had no one. My immediate family and i weren't on good terms growing up. My first friend was a bucktoothed girl who recently moved to where i lived, so she was new to the school. I can still remember our first conversation. We became pretty good friends, and through her i gained two more.

The four of us used to be such good friends, but i guess they got tired of me. Our five year long friendship didn't matter to them. They would pick on the way i acted and on the way i talked, a few memorable times even the way i walked. Every time i opened my mouth they would twist my words into something i didn't mean. If i said i liked someone else's hair, they would twist it into me not liking their hair, for example. It got so bad even i started to believe i was a terrible person, and that nothing i said could ever be positive. At my lowest i could go for days not saying a word. I had trouble with suicidal thoughts and had anxiety like you wouldn't believe. My parents wouldn't believe me when i said i didn't wanna go to school. My dad told me it was a part of life and that i should just deal with it, and that i was just ""overthinking things"".

High school started. I had looked forward to it for over three years because i thought it would be a new opportunity to make different friends. Friends that would actually like me. I forgot to account for the major anxiety still following me. It's been two years and i still haven't. I'm alone. I don't know why people don't like me. why won't anyone be friends with me? I'm 18 and i have no one. I took back and forgave the bucktoothed girl, even though she was my childhood bully and the source behind my biggest insecurity because i'm so lonely.

Six months ago I applied to a new high school abroad, three countries away from my old school. Yesterday i was told i got accepted. I've had nightmares all night about my new classmates bullying me, or walking alone and eating alone and studying alone and dying alone. Nightmares about me doing normal things and them looking at each other with the same expressions my old friends had. I don't regret applying, but i regret being me.

I don't know what i'm doing wrong. I look in the mirror and i only see myself. I don't feel like i have a bad personality - i'm just as human as everyone else. Every time i've tried to adjust my personality to fit a group it just feels fake. I think people notice i'm fake because it never works. i try my best, but i don't know what i'm doing wrong. I still haven't healed, but i'm not an open wound anymore. I'm still afraid to open my mouth and accidentally spew insults, i re-check the way i walk over and over again to make sure i walk like a normal person. I cringe at myself every time i talk cause in my head, i'll get told off by my old friends for the words i pick, or the way i say them. But i don't know how to fix what's wrong with me, or how to make it better and i'm so, so afraid that this new school is just gonna turn out to be exactly like how it is now, because i don't know what i'll do then.

I'm sorry for the rant. It just feels good to finally let it all out. I just need someone to tell me what i'm doing wrong. please.",17May2019,1
120,"When this happened I was around seven months pregnant with my daughter. Other patients kept telling me about how horrible it was to be raised by parents with mental illnesses and that I would have to be really careful with my child or else I might cause her to have mental health problems too. I was already really worried about being a parent and this advice was not helping it was only making me afraid. There is many nice I broke down crying cuz I was convinced I was going to be a bad mother because of these comments. 
They would tell me that their parents had mental health problems and that's why they had mental health issues. I felt like they resented me for having a child. I was emotionally, physically and financially stable I was taking a class for improving self esteem at the time.  
 PSA please don't do this. My daughter is the happiest girl in the world and my only major mistake after she was that I didn't take care of myself and I was far to hard on myself.",17May2019,1
121,"My mom contacted her doctor and her doctor recommended a local mental health facility for me. Most of their online reviews are negative, stating things like they only give advice, they don’t actually help you, and that they disregard “main” issues. I have tried calling them to set up an appointment but they did not answer the phone. 

I just have a quick question for those who have taken the big step of getting mental help, should I still attempt to receive help from this particular place or should I look for someplace else? The bad reviews make me skeptical, and I am already skeptical about getting professional help.

123,"I'm sure it's depression of some sort. Likely coupled with stress, allergies, more stress, anxiety, oh and did I mention a high workload? Weather must be a massive influence too as this is the first day in those twelve days that it's cloudy for the entire day. Almost two weeks I've slept well, been confident, felt optimistic and happy about my life but now I'm none of those things. I wanna do nothing, everything, even my favorite music, annoys me, I wanna be in my bed and cry. But I can't cry because there's objectively nothing to cry about. Literally nothing changed between today and yesterday that could've made me feel this way. So what happened....

Suddenly I'm tired again. I hate what I'm doing in school again. I'm not looking forward to my summer plans any more and I don't want to continue planning them out. Suddenly school stresses me out again. Suddenly none of the things I enjoyed can make me feel good for more than three seconds. I've just lost all my motivation over the course of a single day. And I know this is going to last for a while because it always does. And then it all goes back to being good just as suddenly as now.

All the time I was super aware of the fact I was feeling so good. I knew it was just a matter of time before it would be too much, I would exhaust myself and fall down. Apparently I can take eleven days of high energy before collapsing. Getting therapy for anxiety didn't help... Now I don't know anymore what will.",17May2019,1
124,"This is a question to everyone (I was debating whether to put this on Ask Reddit or on here) who’s had the opportunity of going to therapy or counselling, and I was just wondering how people felt directly after they come out of therapy. 

I ask because I’d like to compare how I feel coming out of therapy to everyone else, and maybe I’ll find comfort if people have experienced what I am experiencing, but I’m also keeping in mind that everyone’s different. I also ask because when therapy is discussed, people normally talk about how they feel after therapy in the long term. But I feel like more could be discussed about therapy in the short term and people’s journeys to overcoming what they’re going through and personal development with therapy, including the ups and the downs. 

I started therapy recently, and in my limited experience, I have come out of therapy and I can either feel more hopeful, or feel like my brain is racing at a million miles an hour and feels as if I’ve taken speed or something lol, or I can feel really shitty and feel my worst for the next couple of days. Today was more of a mixed batch - I felt hopeful in some sense but also like my life is a bit of a mess and I feel pathetic, and I also felt completely drained and tired and had a banging headache and came home and cried a little then napped for a while. 

So, is it normal to feel like this after therapy? Because sometimes it’s hard to tell if it’s helping or not, especially when it’s early days. Please share your experiences, it would help me and hopefully help other people too:)",17May2019,1
125,"Hi r/mentalhealth. So I am feeling worried and almost guilty that I am somehow wrongfully diagnosing myself with depression. I come from a strict household where mental illness is not considered a real thing and people in my school community throw the word around a lot calling themselves depressed (over test grades and stuff like that) when in reality I feel like they're not... But I can't explain this constant continuous feeling that I get in my heart... Extremely with college application season (as a junior in high school) I've begun to become more and more critical and regretful of my entire 17 years of life. I feel mediocre, like I am nothing and will never amount to anything, and I tend to get into really negative episodes. When I need to be doing work or study for APs I can barely gain the motivation to do anything because it's almost like my body is forcing itself to give up. Mentally and physically I feel so down and useless...

These kinds of feelings have been stemming ever since I was a child... My mom and I always got into fights, both on the street and in my own house, where she would get really physically and verbally abusive. Many time after these fights I would often lose control and begin cutting tiny nicks into the side of my wrist with a kitchen knife. There would also be moments when I just wanted to end it all... The most scary time being when I had locked myself in the bathroom, sat in the tub with the water running and just fell asleep. My parents had to bust down the door and the water was almost up covering my entire face... I just grew up with a lot of self-hate and suicidal thoughts and I don't know if that can lead to depression?

Sorry if it seems like I'm overreacting or looking for attention... I just want to know if this seems like behavior that I should get checked upon? It's really hard for me to acknowledge that I could possibly have a mental illness because it's not taken seriously by the people around me... Thanks for taking the time to read this!",17May2019,1

Then I realise that if this were happening to someone who wasn’t mentally ill they would be fine. That really puts things into perspective for me.

129,"I've been so tired, (mentally) these last two weeks, it seems like my depression is getting the better of me. Here recent, I've been waking up nearly every other hour then staying up til 5-6AM straight and I dissociate every few minutes then I end up breaking down due to loneliness, this has been going on for nearly a full week and I've been hardly eating as well.

 I've been fighting with my depression since I was 13 or so, (I'm 17, almost 18) I have SH'd in the past and it's traumatized me, though, I have slowly slipped up a few times and have done minor SH but I fear it'll get worse, and I'll fall into a full relapse. I do distract myself by drawing, watching YT videos and video games, but I can tell I'm hardly doing anything to distract myself from my thoughts. 

I have been seeing a therapist for the past month, every Thurs. (28th will be two months). He's told me, I can try to sit in with the emotions and dissociations and let them happen then ground myself (which I've done more than I care to admit.) But I feel like I'm slowly losing everything, (my sanity, family, friends) I was really considering ending it all last Saturday night Sunday morning. I know it's permanent and this depression is temporary, but I'm stuck. Part of me wants to let the darkness consume me, the other wants to continue fighting. 

It seems really hard for me to hang on for a whole week to see my therapist again. Any tips to help me hang on, I feel like I'm at a dead end. — this happens every week nearly, but I fear this is going to be the worst one yet... I'm so tired of being lonely and depressed.

I graduated law school last weekend, but felt strangely dissociated the entire time. I was extremely stressed out. I chalked it up to being worn out from finals.

I literally just laid there aimlessly, scrolling on my phone and watching tv. What’s the matter with me? I feel like my life is devoid of purpose.

I called my parents in a frenzy, telling them I don’t think I can handle moving out by myself and they told me to extend my lease until July so they can help me (management agreed happily and gave me a discount).

I feel like I can't connect with my S.O sexually either. Usually it is very easy for me when it comes to him. But lately I haven't been interested in sex or anything sexual at all. It hasn't affected our relationship. But since I've been kind of..disconnected mentally he feels like I'm distancing but we've talked that over. He's been supportive of me and trying to help.

Donna Saar was a old lady that died from kidney disease and her middle name was Catherine. He used her name to caption a tire with blood smeared underneath it, as if he were stating he murdered someone name Catherine.

He was posting pictures of what appeared to be blood, his face blurred out with angry faces, and just dark images that couldn't be made out. Apparently he had these teens in group chat that I asked to be added to cause I wanted to see what content he was sending them like the heavy breathing voice recordings and cryptic pictures he sent. I was never added after getting confrontational with the Donna Account, they took down most of their pictures and haven't been active for over a day now. I asked them if they thought it was funny to pretend to be a murderer.

He is using Arabic and Russian on different accounts which makes me think he speaks English and is using translator because when I tried talking to them in Russian they only answered me back with rubbish like ""kcjf dhdhr dhfh jd  r it mama""

Anyways these kids are sick in the head and are following this Donna_saardvrak2019 account and keep giving him attention by acting like victims in group chat and acting scared instead of mature and seeing it is just some punk.

TW: Self Harm, Suicidal Thoughts

About three years ago, I was at my lowest low. I wanted to kill myself, but I was too much of a coward to do so- and that just made me hate myself even more. Nowadays, I thank that cowardice for keeping me alive.

I’m a lot happier now. I have great friends, a great family, etc etc- and even though I’m not doing very well at school, I’m okay with that.

But one night about a month ago I was crying (I can’t remember why, I think I was stressed about exams), and I starting itching my middle finger. Then I started scratching it until it broke skin.

I told myself I wasn’t going to do it again. I talked to one of my friends, who said it sounded like I was bottling up my emotions- and I agree. I told them I wasn’t going to SH again.

But I did. The night before last- I don’t think I was even feeling as bad as the last time- I did the same thing again, this time on my thumb. And bigger this time.

As I was doing it, I was thinking of my friends. I was thinking whether I should tell them, and what they would say.

I was dissatisfied with how the scratch wasn’t deep enough. I kept trying to draw blood, but I never did. Throughout all this time, I was thinking ‘I could just stop. I don’t have to carry on’. I don’t know whether I actually could’ve stopped, but I felt like I could.

I haven’t told anyone I SHed a second time. Heck, I only told one person I did it the first time. I don’t want to die, I don’t think I deserve pain, but... I find it morbidly interesting? I don’t even know.

If I am doing it for attention, I am fully aware of how awful that is. I am a huge advocate for Mental Health awareness and safety, and I am so so sorry if I am doing it for attention. I don’t want to.

I do want to keep SHing, I admit. I have an awful feeling that I’m just doing it for fashion, or because it’s ‘in style’, as I have no reason to be doing it.

I’ve been depressed since at least december. In hindsight i might even have experienced depressive periods prior even though i wasn’t willing to accept it at the time. 

A few weeks ago something changed. After having my worst week yet including what you could describe as a mental breakdown ( me ranting about how much I hate myself, how I feel  that people don’t trust me and so on) after which my friend jokingly told me to “not kill myself” (even though I could tell that he was genuinely concerned) 

On Sunday night that week I started feeling manic. I’ve always had trouble sleeping but this was different I was euphoric and energetic, I wanted to move around. It continued for a couple of days or so until I realized my grandpa was about to die. The euphoria turned to a stressful and nervous feeling which continued for a day or so. I managed to keep it down for a few days when I went on a 2 day trip with my class. 

Since I came home I’ve been depressed but also energetic to some weird degree, I’ve been sleeping a lot more during the days though. 
I’ve also thought more about harming myself than usual. I also feel like I’m more social and that my vision has been worse.

She incorporates spiritual and other things into her practice. However, when I originally scheduled with her I expressed I was having issues with my husband, I provided a brief explanation and she immediately sent me pictures of ""symptoms of codependancy"". Now - We have been in therapy, and I have a therapist, and the therapist currently has never said anything about this. Me and my husband have even talked about very honestly if we're codependant. No one else has ever said this about us. She does not even know the entire story, and started to ""diagnose"". That was a red flag but I let it go.

A week later, on her facebook she posted a VERY inflammatory article (very far on one side of political spectruum - abortion etc) on her facebook. Now, I should not have reacted, but I did. I commented on it sort of saying, how I felt articles like this cause division etc. NOW - REGARDLESS of my opinion, a therapist, posting something like this? I don't know. It is a free country. But it was inflammatory. The conversation got a bit weird, and she ended up saying something a long the lines of:

""As someone who has been raped etc, I feel (insert opinion here).""

I became ENRAGED and very upset, as I have been raped, and have a past history of abuse with more than one incident. I backed out of the conversation because I felt myself becoming angry.

She told me she hoped I healed and found peace, and that it was good of me to speak out on hard issues, after bringing up not only 1 inflammatory article, but a triggering issue such as abuse.

Later, I see a post she makes on her own facebook along the lines of:

""Therapist hat on: (literally she opened with this comment?)

Now my question here is. How do I handle someone, who has not only completely turned a situation around on someone who has a differing opinion, who is also a therapist, and who I have an upcoming appointment with! I want to cancel it. I don't feel comfortable around her now at all. I also do NOT want a therapist who posts inflammatory articles, and then later gets on a soap box about the fighting that was created by her own choice to post something inflammatory?

Also, my boss liked and put hearts by all her comments, disregarded mine (fine we all have different points of view, right?) and now my boss today is on my case about work related issues that previously were never a problem.

I’m female and 5 foot 8 if that helps. Idk I’m just worried and sad. I know it’s probably fine but is there any chance I could suddenly die???,17May2019,2
149,"hello guys and girls, i have a simple question for you.

do you think im a psychward-material?

&amp;#x200B;

i've been trough alot in my life.

im not gona give a backstory miles long but, when i was little i was beaten, like alot, really rough.(broken nose, psychological and physical.)

&amp;#x200B;

whenever i did something bad (or my younger siblings did) i got beaten up alot, i always took the blame for shit i never made.

Bullied in school and got beaten up at home for not fighting back properly, got a counseling man who tried to direct me in the ""right"" direction, i had to go there after school to learn ""productive"" stuff like fixing chainsaws and whatever.

Later discovered he was a molester of his adopted african child and a racist never when to his house again.

Speed forward, age 11 my ""counseler""(?) came home to me one evening after a wicked evening with my mother, she was drunk and had a man over, just ""chilling in the sofa.

me and my younger siblings were starving and had not eaten all day.

i droped a pencilknife at my mothers feet (u know one of those really small ones on a keychain) to get her attention to us.

she called the counseling man, and i ran,he chased me in his car for 3 km during winter until i got home to my granparents house and they locked me in a room to keep me safe while they where arguing outside in the hallway..

&amp;#x200B;

speeding up,

go to forstercare or live with my (previous) drunken dad who used to beat me until i police-charged him  or fostercare.

dad was a nobrain choice,

fostercare is rough, even i knew that at 11.

&amp;#x200B;

speed up some more

&amp;#x200B;

grandpa dies, i lock something up inside me, feel nothing

my babysister (13) gets murdered in an industrial complex.

same thing, lock up, fell nothing.

grandma dies, (of age and fatigue) im getting bottled up,

&amp;#x200B;

I meet a girl who fills me with love and understanding, truly deep everending love, she betrays me and stomps me down, tell people im a rapist and a freak though she tells me im the man she wants to spend the rest of her life with.

she meets a ""trailertrash"" boy who does nothing but drink and toy around with his car and infidelity.

meet her 3 year later, she say i still love you (me) and we get a little fling on.

i find out from her sister that shes pregnant and wants me to be the father.. im like what?

apparently she's been telling folk's that im the father, now her bf is coming for me,her family hates me (used to love me) my friends are all gone cause they all think i raped her. ( we didn't even have sex after she met her bf)

still lover her more than anything in the world, (kinda)

150,"I'm 19 and male. Ever since I can remember, I've been suicidal. My memories from elementary school are filled with illustrations involving my death in the most painful ways. My first attempt at suicide was an overdose on ibuprofen when I was about 7 years old. My first, nearly successful attempt was another overdose when I was 13. It was a cocktail of random drugs I found in my cousin's drawer. Molly, adderall, prescription pain meds, extra strength tylonal, antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, etc.

I've always felt I was to blame for everyone's problems including my own. I've had my fair share of trauma as well. I was molested by my uncle at about 5 years old, found out my step dad wasn't my real dad 2 years prior to that, my real dad tried to kill me with his pickup truck, my entire life I've been moving around due to an alcoholic abusing my mom, abusive relationships, my now fiancee almost committed suicide because of me, etc.

Depression and anxiety run on my mother's side of the family, and who would've thought I got both. Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety on my father's side. Just a cocktail of mental illnesses. Now you know the gist of my story, here's what's going on with me currently:

When I was 13, I had a really bad trip from K-2 (if you wanna learn more about that, go on my profile and look at my latest post). From that, I developed PTSD and have flashbacks to the trip, and in those moments, I completely lose track of time. 20 sometimes 30 minutes or more pass by. 

Outside of the flashbacks, I hear voices telling me to kill myself and sometimes to kill other people before I go to bed at night. I've also been paranoid beyond belief, especially during stressful situations and public places. I feel like someone or something is out to kill me.

I go between seemingly two personalities: completely empathetic and seemingly psychopathic. When I say that, I mean them by they're complete definitions. It's never in the middle. Then when I get angry, I can't contain myself. I've blacked out from anger and have done things I regret to this day. I'm just thankful I never did anything unforgivable. 

I can also never say the right words when talking to someone. For example I've accidentally said someone berated me when i meant barraged me with questions. I've also come up with random words that don't fit in a sentence but have fit into whatever the hell I was thinking. 

For years, I've never said any of this out loud and whenever I brought it up to my fiancee, she gets scared of me. My own mother said she was afraid of me before. And with everything that's been going on with me mentally and at home, I want nothing more than to just die because I feel like I'm no better than my father. I feel like no matter how hard I try, I always just fuck up and spew apologies. I just never seem to do the right thing or make the right choice even when I know better. I don't even have insurance to get the help i desperately need. I just don't know what's wrong with me.",17May2019,2
151,"I had my first appointment with a psychiatrist and they diagnosed me with Bipolar 2. I thought having a diagnosis would be scary but it actually just feels so freeing. I finally understand my symptoms and why I feel the way I feel. He put me on Sertraline (Zoloft) and Lamictal. 

If anyone has any experience with these drugs or can just offer me some encouragement I’d really appreciate it.",17May2019,3
152,"This time of year is painful for me. My mother died a week after my 20th birthday which is around this time of year, so that in combination with Mother's Day creates a lot of negativity.

My father had died when I was 18.  I was going through university at the time and therefore never had that ""moment"" to process it all. I just had to keep slogging along.

I remember graduating (first gen btw!) hoping I could have that ""moment."" Instead the socioeconomic realities of my station smacked me in the face and things were even more stressful. I was facing rural destitution (stupidly went home after graduation out of misplaced nostalgia). They were junkies and had no assets. I use that point because of the realities of familial patronage as it relates to wellbeing and success. 

Things got very hard, although I got out of the region quickly, albeit in a risky and haphazard fashion. I have endured starvation and a sense of a total lack of agency with nothing but my own mind to torture me.

I didn't give in, and I am now in a positively progressing situation. Now that I am here, I find myself troubled. I went for many years taking it to the gut without reaction. I hardly ever cried about it, although I clearly began going through depression and executive functioning issues. 

Now my mind feels a bit broken. I dwell on negative thoughts about my experiences. Everything in society reminds me acutely of my socioeconomic station. Everything about my peers' behavior reminds me of their naivety regarding the potential brutality of existence, pain, and death. They don't know that fear and that darkness.

I have extreme executive functioning problems now. I can't even start a movie. I spend my free time either obsessing over research about socioeconomic inequality and arguing about it with others or pacing around frankly talking out loud about my traumas and my interests. I do almost literally ""nothing.""

I want it recognized. I want at least one person to try and comprehend it. I don't want a recommendation for a therapist I can't afford (working on it...but am not there yet). I don't want a suicide hotline number that makes you wait half an hour. I don't want an ""I'm sorry....that must have been difficult."" I want it recognized. I want at least one person to try and comprehend it.",17May2019,1
