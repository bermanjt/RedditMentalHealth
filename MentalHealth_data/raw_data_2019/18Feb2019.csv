0,"Ill start from the beginning. I've always had anxiety problems, ever since i was a little kid but in the past few years I've been feeling terrible. I think it started when i was 15 where on night i just sitting and there was  weird pop in my neck which afterward made me thing there was something wrong with my eye, I didn't get anxious I just didn't like it. Went to an eye doctor, said everything was fine. Time goes on and at the end of the school year, right at the beginning of the summer it came back. I thought i was going blind or that there was something wrong with my eyes position in my head and I can see more of my skin with that one than the other one. I spent the whole summer like this, depressed and sad about my eye.  When school came around again though it went away. The next summer at about the same time as the year before I started having anxiety about possibly being gay and id spend my whole day obsessing and checking so make sure I wasn't, The anxiety was terrible. Again it lasted the whole summer but its never gone away I've just stopped checking and analyzing and the anxiety about it is also gone. Also ever since the end of a terrible relationship I've been feeling numb, as if i have no emotion about anything, I don't want anything, I don't enjoy anything, no motivation, no aspirations. Soon after the terrible relationship i got into a new one, I didn't really want it because of all the aforementioned things I don't feel. So soon after that started I started having a lot of anxiety about this person and the relationship, whether we were compatible or not, If I found them attractive, etc. In effect making me want to run away from this person at all costs, even though they'd done nothing to warrant it. It still goes on today even though were just friends now. I've spent numerous hours searching my symptoms up and seeing what it could be. OCD, Depression, Anhedonia, GAD, and recently Neurosis, Or Schizophrenia. Every know and again i have some temporary relief and think I've been cured, but it always comes back I know you'll tell me to go see a doctor and get diagnosed, I know I should. However I'd like to know if any of you out there have experienced what i'm feeling or something similar and perhaps give me some insight in to what I might have. Any help at all is appreciated.",18Feb2019,1

3,"You know, I don't think anyone will ever fall in love with me. I don't actually know if that's just my bad self esteem telling me that or if something else could force that thought.

It's not like I haven't tried. Maybe they were just all the wrong people? But, when everyone you've ever dated has been abusive cheaters, how can you expect anyone to be any different?

And it's not like I think I'm so awful. I try to be as kind and polite as I can. I'm not really ugly, although I'm not my own cup of tea. I'm a really hard worker and a good provider. I have great relationships with my family and at least 6 friends who seem to enjoy beinh around me.

I just dont think I have ""it"". Whatever ""it"" is that makes people want you romantically. The thing that makes people fall in love. Whatever ""it"" is, I couldn't even guess.

I worry I'll die very alone.",18Feb2019,1
4,"Ugh. Can I say that enough?

It's been years since I've dated someone with the intention of a long term relationship. I haven't really had a long term relationship and I'm 28. I've done the hookup thing and I'm over it. I'm to the point where it doesn't turn me on anymore and I really don't even have as high of a sex drive as I used to (maybe in my early 20s).

I've been busy off and on, either focusing on school, then a career and now going back to school to start a new career. I'm busy, and I've always been too busy but deep down know I could make time if I really wanted. The problem is, the idea of getting dressed up and getting to know someone and putting that effort out feels exhausting to me. Sometimes I even get annoyed when someone wants to talk to me and I just don't want to. I could say that I'm focusing on a career but deep down I know that is more of an excuse.

Ideally, I would just wake up one day and be in something that is healthy and has worked for 3 years already. It's the in-between, the beginning, the figuring it out that I have no interest in. It just doesn't feel hopeful or magical to me.

The parts of me that want a relationship want someone I can rely on, talk to, someone who is supportive and that has my back. Deep down I am a hopeless romantic- I like Valentines day, I like cute shit. I just don't know if I really believe in it happening.

Aaand here's the negative part. I am frustrated with being myself and being open only to have some guy cross a boundary and turn it into something purely sexual. There is this sinking feeling I  get when I'm just hanging out with a guy and being myself and it starts getting sexual. It makes me kind of sad and then I feel myself turn into someone else and I just kinda do it.

I don't know how to be in a relationship, I feel uncomfortable with the idea of bringing someone around my family and integrating someone into my life (maybe because I've never really done that) and overall have no idea how to have an appropriate relationship.

I've always been there for me and only know what it is like to have myself, family and friends there for challenging times.

I do want it to be different but don't know how to encompass all my feelings about it so I can figure out what my issue is.",18Feb2019,2
5,"Ever since coming off ssris 7 months ago, I've been in this depressive, anhedonic state that won't subside regardless of lifestyle changes/therapy. Despite exercising near daily, quitting recreational drugs, sleeping well, I still wake up every morning wishing I didn't.

I hate when people say ""it could be worse"", a better thing to say would be ""look at what you still have"".

8,"I've had these fantasies of killing people much more recently right in the carotid artery. I want to know what it's like to take a life, and at the same time I need to know how well I'd handle it. However, I feel as if I'm not ready enough and I need to build up to it by committing smaller  crime to gain confidence, in case I don't do it right and am caught. I've been contemplating slashing people's tires just to get me ready. I've made sure that there are no cameras and I know to beware of dashboard cams in the cars. I know I will not get caught. 

These itches feel like they are in my head and I need to really scratch it. I guess the feeling is similar to the need to pee when there are no toilets around and you are there just dancing around anxiously. 

I could go on about why I want to kill people but just keeping this short to vent and hopefully helps.

10,"Honestly, it probably goes back to when I was a little kid. The way that I look simply doesn’t correlate with the person I feel I ought to be. All I’ve ever wanted is to have a well-structured square facial shape, a straight, not too prominent nose, and naturally straight hair that just does what I want it to. Instead, I’ve got a longer face shape, a long Roman nose, and extremely dense wavy hair (which I started straightening a couple of years ago, but it’s not the same).

11,"Hello, unlike many of you, my mental health is in check most of the time, but lately it’s been getting worse. I’ve had a few panic attacks and moments where I’ve lashed out in pent up frustration that I find hard to contain and thought that it was about damn time I got medicated or something. But when I calmed down I was fearful of side effects. I took a deeper look at myself and decided I wasn’t doing enough in my every day life to equip myself to handle stress and anxiety. So I’m going to start doing that.

I’ve decided to vlog about it. And while I am sort of shamelessly self promoting, maybe just one person can see this as a “sign” to start taking control of their own lives too, and that would be amazing.

Using vlogging as an accountability tool, I aim to tackle my sleeping problems, my emotional eating, my lack of desire to care for my appearance, my inactivity, and my controllable stressors (my fear aggressive dog, homework management) through slow lifestyle changes and dedicatedly experimenting to find what works best for me.

If you feel like joining me would help, I can absolutely be your buddy in this :) and you can start vlogging too. Or just messaging me.

“Conning others; being manipulative.” I can be manipulative when needed.

“Poor control over behavior” assuming this means impulsivity I have this however it’s gotten better with time.

“Promiscuous sexual behavior” usually relationships don’t last too long.

“Being impulsive” I used to be much more so than now.

“Being irresponsible” in the way others my age are.

“Blaming others and refusing to accept responsibility” I do this depending on what the blame is.

17,"I've been suffering through what was diagnosed as ""depression"" for the majority of my 20's (4+ years). I'm starting to think that's not what it is. People have always commented that I'm odd, poor at communicating clearly, and a terrible project partner. Mostly I think I just can't sleep, or think clearly, or stay mentally present.

I've tried MAOIs, SSRIs, even Lithium.

I think I had a couple &lt;1 hour ""hypomanic"" episodes on the MAOI's over one year. The 'euphoric' mood was there, very mild like I'd had a couple beers, and I mulled over doing things I wouldn't normally consider. Can't say the MAOI really did anything for me.

For the most part the reuptake inhibitors didn't do anything either, and the lack of energy and brainfog were still bad like with the MAOI's. I came off as less irritable on the SSRI's but didn't feel that way.

The lithium worked for mood, irritability, but not energy. Being in a good mood, no irritability, I'm told I come off as hypomanic yet I feel no euphoria (Still felt ""fried"" more than not like normal).

The focus, energy, and communication problems weren't solved until I started pounding a 5-hour energy when my alarm clock goes off, and again in the early afternoon. I still fluctuate, but it's been more effective than any prescription I've tried.

Any idea what's actually going on?

My anxiety is mild and was made worse due to me feeling like I was failing people at work I truely care about, my rampant alcoholism (got that in check pretty nicely at only drinking one to two times a week when with friends), and an underlying anxiety condition. It still acts up from time to time but recently has really died down. I started Buspirone in late November and I credit it for making life easier.

My OCD has gotten worse, though. I am having tic type behavior that is VERY noticeable. The Buspirone helps with the anxiety component to the OCD though.

Over the past few weeks I have been having mood swings. I am certainly not suicidal, though I do think depressing thoughts frequently and sometimes wish my environment would drastically accelerate things. I will be feeling down for days, only to have a VERY sudden and often short lived “up” period. I am easily frustrated, though I am nice to everyone around me and internalize my frustration. I cool off very quickly and am not a violent person, more of the “Hey dipshit what the fuck is wrong with you” type on the rare occasion I lash out.

23,"throwaway account, sorry if this is long, will have a tl;dr at bottom

&amp;#x200B;

First, I have some background if it's important. My mom was an alcoholic, drug addict (she still is), and cheated on my dad. They divorced when I was 7, and my mom hasn't tried to reach out to me since.

&amp;#x200B;

About a year ago, I started having feelings of nervousness. The earliest ""incidents"" I remember were 

1) my parents(dad and step mom) got into a fight, so my dad got his keys and walked out of the house. I was hiding in my room and started freaking out, and had convinced myself that my dad had left us for good. I know it was irrational but I was freaking out until he got home (about an hour later)

2) in the middle of class last year, with no current fear or stress causing it, my hands starting shaking uncontrollably. I couldn't write because they were shaking so much. I have no idea why.

Now, I have feelings of anxiety a lot. My hands shake pretty much daily, a lot of times without anything stressful happening. I've even had a friend's mom come up to me and hold my wrist and was concerned as to why I was shaking. Other times I get almost like heat flashes, I don't know how else to describe it, but I get really hot and sometimes start to sweat, and a fast heartbeat usually accompanies this. This is without physical exertion. That happens less frequently, and usually always has a reason (example getting a bad grade on a test)

I don't know if this means anything, but recently, I've been SUPER scatterbrained. I forget everything, lose everything (I have currently misplaced my glasses and still can't find them) and my grades (I'm usually an A student, high honor roll, gifted) have been dropping because I turn in SO MANY assignments late.

I don't know if this is anxiety or not, or what I should do about. I have told my bf and three of my closest friends about this and that's it. Thanks to everyone who took the time to read this.

I got the job friday. Last night I woke up screaming from a nightmare. 

The really jacked up thing is I had an appointment tomorrow with my psych. I got a call Friday afternoon saying they needed to reschedule. Last night I realized I had just enough medication to get me through tonight as I was to see her tomorrow morning. My brain went into a total panic where I self harmed but don’t remember doing it. Doc office closes around 3 on Friday so of course by the time it hits me, it’s 1am and I’m taking meds to go to sleep.  I didn’t sleep that night. Didn’t sleep last night and today have been so spun up I can’t rest. I’ve spent the past two days laying down and high af to try to avoid the bs that is my life and this first world problem but I know tonight will be the same. I don’t have to be in until 5 tomorrow night which makes it worse.

I got a call today about another job, and have contact for a second option. The fact that these better options are on the table are even more demotivating. They are not guaranteed, but I have my foot in the door, it’s just waiting out a series of interviews.  I know the right thing to do would be to go to the job until I have something else locked down, but at the same time I feel like when I get there the whole world is just going to crash in on me. Like it be literally nothing but angry customers screaming at me or my new boss cutting me off to tell me personal stories I don’t care about. That’s how my two interviews went .. it was easy to be the yes man to weasel my way in. It makes me feel spineless and like a leech. I’ve really been in a place where I need to see my psych for a while and was really in need of a meeting with her. I understand personal things happen but she’s literally the only doc I’ve felt safe around to talk about things. The back and forth in my head is so frustrating.

27,"
There's a TLDR at bottom, but  I will still try to make this as short as possible. I [F28] and my Fiance [M38] are currently in a crappy living situation (I'll rate it at a 3/10, 1 being I'd rather be homeless and 10 being a perfect living situation) and have the ability to greatly improve our circumstances (8/10) by living with my relative [F47].

To keep this short I'll list a few  key things you'll have to accept as fact without the long winded backstory:
- it is not possible for my fiance and I to have our own place 
- it is not possible for my relative to find a place of their own 
- we will get accepted when applying together, but not apart. 
- this relative is our *best* option as far as roommates go
- My personality is that of an introvert, quiet, need lots of alone time and I get socially exhausted very quickly and take a long time to replenish that energy 
- This relative has taken care of me for a long time during my childhood and I do appreciate that and say so quite often. 
- my fiance has a very amiable personality and doesn't have any problem with the situation, he gets along with most people. 
- I can not have another 'talk' with this relative about their behavior or personality. I have tried and they are set in their ways. It got to the point where it was unhealthy for myself to help them see their wrongs. 

Okay, now that that is out of the way, to the heart of the issue. I do not get along with the personality of this relative of mine. At all.  I want to emphasize this is completely a personality thing. Their ability to be a good roommate (I trust them, they are cleanly and will pay their rent on time)  is not in question. However this relative is the antithesis to my mental health. They personify the opposite of my introverted, open-minded, quiet personality (think baby talk, jealousy, playing the victim, very loud talker, pettiness, undertones of bigotry and racism, extreme approval seeking, guilt mongering, extreme narcissism, constant talking etc). The dislike I feel is quite intense at times which I then feel guilty for and then the cycle starts again. 

Most of these traits I see in her interactions with others, not so much myself although it does happen occasionally (' I raised you all those years and this is how you repay me?') . I keep our conversations as nice and short as possible. It really seems like such a silly little problem but remember, this will be my home. Meaning when I come home from being socially exhausted of the outside world my home will need to be my refuge. It's likely the home we will seek will have a decent living space so that we can (for the most part ) be out of each other's way but still. 

So what I'm looking for is anything you can tell me to make this situation more tolerable in my mind. I already try to interact with her as little as possible but what do I do when she seeks me out?  I know it's the real world and I'm going to interact with people I disagree with no matter how much I try to surround  my life with people who share my ideals.  I need to control my facial expressions and reactions especially because I wear my emotions on my face. I'm a firm believer that you have something to learn from everyone you meet, but I'll admit I'm having a tough time with this one.

  Have you ever had to work closely with someone you clash with or something similar? I want to work on myself to make this doable because having a place is very very important to me right now.

I've been trying to keep calm and just wait it out but I've been getting sudden tightness in the chest and my heart suddenly starts beating like crazy; this has been happening like twice an hour for the past four days. I know the response should come in soon, but I am honestly REALLY worn out and stressed from these mini anxiety attacks. I try to breath slowly in and out but it only helps after the fact. If anyone else has been in a anxious situation are there any techniques I can do to help myself?? I'm really, just so so tired from stressing for the past weeks.",18Feb2019,3
32,"I've always been the slow one in my group of friends. Whether it's taking a long time to finish my turn when we play a CCG (such as Magic The Gathering) because I can't figure out what I want to do, asking them to go over the rules multiple times during a new tabletop game, or just making plans. They like to poke fun at me for it and I did a pretty good job of not letting it effect me outside of our weekly game night.

When I was single and living on my own I never caught on just how much time slipped away from me because I never thought about it. I would just put my head down and work until it was time to go home. When I got home I would do nothing in particular (usually video games, TV, etc.) until it was time for bed.

 I was a listless bachelor, so what? I wasn't slow, I just didn't have anything to move fast for. I didn't have a roommate or people coming over to clean up for, nobody to worry about letting down but myself. Fast forward from my bachelor self to today's married self.

- I take hours to do the dishes or fold the laundry.
- I can't seem to fully complete any task without either missing a step or outright messing it up.
- I can have my wife break down step by step instructions for me only to not remember part or all of them by the end of the conversation.
- I have to take way too long at work to accomplish tasks, forget to follow-up on tasks that are on hold

All of this is assuming I even manage to look at the time between when I get home and when I need to go to bed so I can get up for work. There are times when I get home, feed our pets, walk the dog, and it's somehow past time for bed and I've accomplished NOTHING. My wife can't tell if I'm lazy, stupid, or just don't love her enough to pick up the pace or chip in around the house.

I was diagnosed with ADD in the 90's and stopped taking my prescribed Ritalin shortly after starting highschool mostly because it never seemed to help. I'm in my 30's now and (perhaps the icing on the stress cake) my mother was recently diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's.

I'm afraid to seek professional help directly because I feel like I'll either find out that this is a real problem that I can't afford to fix or, somehow even worse, that I'm imagining all this and I'm just as lazy and worthless as I feel.

 I'm not sure what I'm expecting Reddit to do for me. If anyone has any suggestions for how to make things better that aren't ""try harder"" or ""just be faster and pay attention"" then I welcome them.",18Feb2019,4

34,"I've been suffering with major depression and anxiety for sometime. Around age 16/17 (I honestly can't remember the exact age I was but I digress) I had a psychotic episode which caused me to line up knives  and started hearing voices. I would hear the sound of my father who abused me call me dirty amongst other things I would rather not have out on the internet. I told my doctor dealing with my mental health who put it down to my depression being severe. I haven't had an episode since but I'm beginning to worry that another one might be imminent and was wondering if there are some way to prevent this or if I'm just being overly dramatic. 
I lost my mum to cancer last year and it's caused me to become really down. Alongside having family problems and a lack of support from them, it hasn't helped and I became really suicidal and wanted to harm myself. After that downward spiral I have now been hearing the sound of my mother, clear as day whispered in to my ear. I'm conflicted about this, as is my family as they are spiritualists (as am I to some extent)  and believe it is my deceased mother letting me know she is still around,which a big part of me does but the other half of me acknowledges that I have poor mental health at the moment and it could be down to that. I am currently on medication and although I'm starting to feel a lot less sadder, it isn't exactly stopping the highs and lows I experience which my Dr told me was 'unipolar.' I am not sure what to think about this all, could a potential episode be preventing me from recovering?  Am what I experiencing a sign of an episode coming? Or am I just getting worried over nothing?
Thank you for reading my long post. ",18Feb2019,1
35,"So my nana, my mom's mom, has been in the hospital for the past couple weeks fighting an infection. She's not really close with us, and she was never around for my mom while she was growing up. She also lives a few hours away, we basically never see or talk to her, although my mom either calls her or she calls my mom maybe once or twice a year to check up and whatever. Anyway, I decided to drive out there and see her, just so it doesn't all fall onto my mom to support her and I expected it to be awkward and boring. But when I got there, this poor old withered woman went from miserable to full of life when I walked through the door. Her memory is going a little bit and shes somewhat paranoid of things (maybe onset of dementia?) Anyway things were going okay and I was dealing with her paranoid ramblings pretty well. We began looking through this book full of all her grandchildren that my mom made for her, and she kept pausing to ask why I came out that way. I had actually been helping my father in law move, so I was somewhat out that way anyway, but I didn't want to say that so I just said I was thinking of her and thought she might be bored and lonely (which was actually true). And she paused for a moment and she just seemed so overtaken by that. We got talking about travelling and skiing and sailing, and she went on about how she'll take me to England and teach me sailing and stuff (which is obviously impossible now). She told me how proud of me she is and how much she loves me. For some reason things began to feel a bit much, and I said my goodbyes and made my exit for a long drive home. I got in my car, and cried like an absolute baby. And I am not exaggerating. I honestly don't think I've ever cried that hard, or as loudly, except for maybe when I was 3.",18Feb2019,2
36,"Hey all, I'm mostly posting here because I feel like I'm spiraling out of control, I've been posting on /r/schizophrenia for the past few months but I don't actually have a schizophrenia diagnosis so it feels weird to co-opt that space for my own personal problems. I'm a 28 year old guy, and when I was 19-20 I had a major psychotic break that lasted around five months, but that was my first and last. Since then I've been living a pretty normal unmedicated life, and about two years ago I started TRT for Klinefelters. I've also been living a pretty boring life so as not to trigger another episode, no idea if that's how that works but when I had my first one I was using a lot of drugs, I no longer do that. 

Starting around 5-6 months ago after almost a decade without any issues I started feeling really worried and out of place. Paranoid is too strong of a word, just kind of a general uneasiness and like I'm not a real person. I chalked it up to the new stressful job I'd just started and largely ignored it. Since then it's just been worse and worse. I keep having fears that are really out of character for me. I can't shake the feeling my house is haunted even though I don't believe in ghosts at all. I constantly feel nauseous, I go through bouts where I don't want to eat at all followed by bouts of being insatiably hungry. Several times per day I get the feeling I'm being watched or followed. It's not constant, but when I get it it's overpowering and lasts 20-30 seconds. It mostly happens at work and I'm considering quitting my job because it's gotten worse and worse over the course of the past few months. 

The feeling I have is most comparable to the feeling you get when you're in the woods by yourself for long periods of time and it's starting  to get dark and you're not sure what you're seeing is actually what's there, and the bird/insect sounds start to sound like human voices. Just a general unease/""I shouldn't be here/I don't know which direction is home"" feeling. I've had panic attacks and it doesn't feel like that. There's no pounding in my chest, there's no adrenaline, there's no fight or flight, just a feeling somewhere between the beginning of a horror movie and the entirety of NIN's *Pretty Hate Machine*. 

Sometimes it comes with an urge (that I've never acted on and probably won't) to mutilate myself in some way, like getting a facial tattoo or doing something that would make me unrecognizable. I don't want to die but I wish I could be in a different time in a different place with a different face. 

I don't think what I've just written conveys the absolute urgency of what I'm experiencing and I'm trying to figure out how to get that across. It's overwhelming anxiety but in a deadly calm way. ",18Feb2019,4
37,"I should be in my prime. I turn 18 in two days, and my best friend is throwing a huge party to celebrate this weekend. I got a major role in the school musical. I’m a leader in a mentoring program at school. My other best friend asked me to prom, and I got my dream dress.  I’m about to graduate high school soon. I got into and will be attending my dream college, in a big city miles away from my small town. I have a part time job I love. I have a very active social life. My friends and family are amazing. I have everything going for me.

And yet, I feel terrible. I struggle to get out of bed. I have no motivation to do anything. I don’t even have the energy to clean my room. My grades are awful. I have a 5 page paper due in two days (also my birthday) that I haven’t started on. I’m failing math. I started smoking. I’ve been bingeing and purging almost every day for months. 

I’ve been diagnosed with GAD and ADHD, but I haven’t seen a therapist or Psychiatrist in about a year because I became addicted to the medication I was prescribed (Adderall) and nearly killed myself.

41,"To start off I'll explain my story, for someone my age I've gone through more than many adults have in their entire lives but, ill focus on the stuff I feel is causing this. My story starts when I was little, maybe 5 or 6 and my parents got a divorce. As you can imagine this was very traumatic and was hard to accept especially for how close I was to my dad. We would spend time every once and a while and would keep in touch when we could. My family later moved to a different state and me and my dad lost contact with him. He fell into a deep depression  (he had bipolar disorder) and eventually broke up with his wife and became homeless. While this was going on I was getting relentlessly bullied at my school, they would follow me home and try to dehumanize me. Eventually I moved to a different school after a year of that hell. Memories of what happen still haunt me to this day. At the beginning of 2018 my dad picked up heroin and started to abuse it. He died January 12, 2018 of bronchitis and pneumonia, because he didn't want to go to the hospital. I was deviated by this and became very suicidal and depressed. I went to an outpatient program and was helped out for a couple months until I was deemed ready to be released. (I was released in march) a month later my dog died of heart disease. As you can imagine this was heart breaking and I was depressed for a couple months. 

        I eventually got better and wanted to work at a scout camp I worked at the past year. I loved this place and I have many memories of great times there so I was very excited. When I got there however, it was different from the past year. Everyone treated me differently and they were very very mean. I relapsed and went to weed to calm my nerves. Which was a bad idea, because one night I was caught smoking and I was fired on the spot. There goes another good thing in my life. I still have nightmares from being fired that night. I cry the second I see an add for the camp and it hurts to think that I can never work there again.

     I've been working my best at school and it still doesn't seem to be enough. I've noticed that I'm just getting uglier and worse at school. I've become very iritable, numb, and I've lost all motivation for everything but watching TV. I feel as though I lost my empathy for others and animals alike. I feel like my life is going downhill and it keeps going faster and faster towards rock bottom. ",18Feb2019,1
42,"If it wasn’t for being hospitalized and getting everything taken from me (phone, clothes, underwear, purse) I would tell my dr I’m having suicidal thoughts. I don’t have a plan or anything the thoughts just keep creeping into my mind ever since I had my concussion 3 was ago. I’ve been off work since the fall and I’m not sure if that has anything to do with it or not. I don’t have family that I’m close with and very little friends. My friends only talk with me when they have nothing else to do. I’m very frustrated since the concussion. I can’t drive because of the dizziness and headaches. I can’t work. I just want my life back.

43,"I was anorexic for over a year, and I’ve recovered. Or tried to recover. My appetite is almost completely gone, and sometimes it boosts so much it feels like I could scratch my eyes out from the hunger pains. I feel sick when I’m about to eat. I feel sick after eating. I feel sick to the thought of eating. But I always thought I was recovered. I stopped the scheduled meals, I stopped restricting, I stopped avoiding food I was terrified of. But I went back to those habits, and I’m just now realizing it. I’ve become obsessed with my weight but I can’t look at the scale. I’m terrified. If I look at the scale I know it’ll become full circle. They always said that recovering is the hardest part, and I get why. It feels like anorexia will be with me for the rest of my life.

It’s not worth the pain, the headaches, it’s not even worth the weight you lose.

45,"I live in a house with 6 roommates. My rent is VERY cheap and for the most part I get along with everyone which is such a rarity that I am afraid to move. It is a large house so it's not terribly crowded, but it is very messy. The majority don't care/don't have time/don't think cleaning is their responsibility. And on a number of levels I'm okay with that because I know I can't assign MY standard for cleanliness on other people.

But sometimes one will annoy me for some reason and I scrub down the whole house in a passive aggressive fueled rage. Which is honestly a net positive. When the house is gross it is embarrassing to me when other people come over and see the place. I feel inadequate and ashamed. I am the only woman and I feel on some level like society has made it MY role to keep the house clean because I feel like I am the only one who cares, which, honestly is not wrong. So when the house is disgustingly filthy I feel like I have failed. 

Organizing chore charts doesnt help, because, as I've mentioned, nobody cares. It comes off as naggy when I ask people to help and it causes tension so it's easier just to clean it myself to my own standard. 

When I do clean the house though I am fueled by rage because I have this inner monologue of how I'm the only one cleaning blah blah. But when I'm complacent and dont clean I feel like I'm inadequate and feel bad about myself for living in such a gross house. I really want a way to find motivation to clean that isn't rage so I can keep on top of it WITHOUT hating myself and everyone else and draining all my emotions.

What I wasn’t prepared for was the part where he flipped a switch, passed out into an unresponsive state and when I solicited help to bring him to consciousness he, begrudgingly, wanted to fight everyone, but mostly threaten his own life. This caused a scene. 
After we got kicked out, I literally dragged him down the street toward my car, all the while he yelled about wanting to kill himself. I’m a gal, he’s a guy. This argument almost turned physical, it seemed like he didn’t know who I was, his old high school BFF who just wanted to play Connor Oberst songs and talk about recipes and memories til our mouths fell off. He was a hollow person.

49,"Hello. I'm a 32 y/o male. I feel like I may be some sort of (mild) sociopath. I have a difficult time relating to other people. I try to date but most of the time I find the people I meet to not be very interesting. 


I have a hard time making friends outside of work and school (I went back to school at 28 and will be graduating with an engineering degree in April) and those I do meet are mostly superficial. I have a couple of close friends, but lately I've been distancing myself and removing friends in social media.


I probably have some systemic medical problems that I've been neglecting due to high healthcare costs and lack of insurance and I don't even know where to begin to address them. I only recently got medical insurance through my employer, but I'll be changing plans once I start full time in May, so anything I pay to this deductible will be wasted.


The only times I get excited are when I watch sports and my favorite team wins against the odds. I'd really like to get more out of life.


I've never been in a long term relationship. I would really like to start a family, but everyone I meet is much more experienced and holds me to standards that I've just never approached. The idea that normal people have sex on a semi-regular basis is so foreign to me. I feel like I'll never make that kind of connection with someone. I ask myself ""what do I have to offer that Joe 6-pack can't offer in a relationship"" and I draw blanks. I want to invest in myself but I feel like I've missed the boat.


The only thing keeping me going is the idea that tomorrow I'll still be 32 and these problems will still be here if I don't address them. I thought that applying myself and achieving a difficult goal was the way to self-realization, but I have so much more to work on. I feel overwhelmed and I don't know what the best use of my energy is.

51,"I've dealt with depression and anxiety issues for like, 20 years, but today I was hit with something so intense that I felt compelled to write about it just to try and ease my mind. I went on a first date like a week ago and I really liked the person and the date was going well, but I had a lot of coffee, which isn't normal for me, and got tongue tied at the end of the date, and they were really turned off by that and didn't want to see me again. So I spent basically all day for the last week beating myself up over that dumb decision to drink all that coffee, wondering how I could make such a dumb mistake and not see that happening. Just beating myself into the ground for it. This is common for me, though, whenever I make a mistake that has a negative impact on me that was easily avoidable. But then today for some reason on top of that an incident from like three months ago where somebody was being really condescending and I confronted them about it perhaps a little harshly but not unfairly but they knew everybody at the place we both frequent really well and started spreading their version of the story where of course I'm the villain. And while I know I wasn't ""wrong"" to do that, I got really mad at myself for making another dumb decision that was easily avoidable. I could have not been so harsh, I could have just let it go, but I made the wrong decision, even though it should have been easy to make the right one.

&amp;#x200B;

That's the point where I sort of unraveled, because I lost the ability to trust myself to make any right decisions, and I just felt so dumb for every mistake I've ever made, and I started worrying about all the mistakes I will make in the future, and I got really depressed and started to feel like I didn't have what it takes to continue living, because I couldn't believe in myself to not make mistakes. And then I realized that basically what bothers me is that I'm not perfect, like all humans, but the difference is that I functionally can't live with that. No matter how intellectually I am aware of the fact people make mistakes, people say things that aren't perfect, they make decisions that are regrettable, and that I at least am worried about other people and have their best interests in mind and don't want to hurt anybody, or myself, I can never live with my mistakes. I know I will keep thinking about that date, and continue to tell myself everything I could have done differently. It won't stop, because I can't change what happened, and I can't fix it. I know letting go of that stuff is Therapy 101 shit, but I just can't, on a fundamental level, handle that. So yeah, that's where I am.",18Feb2019,1

I miss having someone to play with that got me, that I could stand talking to, someone that didn't get on my nerves and piss me off. The kicker is we were best friends for 13+years. I was having financial troubles and he gave me written permission to sell some of his video games he didn't play anymore so I could afford my car insurance, about 3 weeks afterwards he thought those games were stolen (he smoked and drank very heavily however cause he just got home from work I knew he was not under the influence yet) he called the cops and when they told him the results and told them who sold them he tried to press charges. I got to talk to him about the situation and everything seemed fine, he said he was sorry for the misunderstanding and was gonna do what he could, or so he said. I go to the court date and the cop went to talk to the judge and said that he (the officer) believed it to be one big misunderstanding and threw the case out. I was living with him as both my parents (divorced so two separate homes) kicked me out for bs reasons I'd rather not go into, but after that case he kicked me out with no notice, only way I found out was all my stuff, my TV, computer, console, guitars, everything I owned was on his front lawn......

58,"A while ago I was sexually assaulted by someone I really trusted. Recently I have been noticing that I’m feeling strange, I tense up at any physical contact and if a man I don’t know even walks or drives by me I get scared. I think I might have PTSD. For reasons I’ve explained in another post I can’t really talk to my parents or a therapist about this. I know that reddit can give diagnoses, but I was wondering if this sounds like the symptoms of PTSD, and if so, what can I do about it. It’s starting to really effect my life as I don’t feel comfortable anywhere in public.",18Feb2019,1
59,"Hey, sorry if I'm rambling I don't have much time to write this post and my thoughts are scattered right now. 

First some information, I'm a 17 yo male, I always had bad social anxiety and some paranoia, I have a few friends but beyond that I pretty much can't talk to anyone from my class.

So 4 days ago my class organized a night at a homestead, I usually stay away from events like these, but my friend was going so I said fuck it and went too.

I knew that without any chemical help I wouldn't be able to talk to anyone there so I took 1mg of clonazepam and drank half a beer. And to my surprise it went absolutely fantastic I finally talked to a girl I like from class and overall it was a great night.

The day after I had to go to a skiing trip to Austria, and that's where it started going downhill. For some reason my anxiety and paranoia went through the roof. For the last 3 days I've been exausted from over thinking absolutely everything from why I said something to what I'm going to do when I come back to school. I've been feeling very lonely and I constantly cry when I see things that remind me of my conversations with the girl I like.

Please help me understand what is going on. This is really exhausting and I want it to end.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, I would really appreciate any responses.

Thanks",18Feb2019,1
60,"Panic attack, anxiety attack, I'm honestly not sure what it is I have.

Well, people get them normally right? Once in a blue moon? I'm not diagnosed with anything so I figure mine are normal.

I've had them due to the following things:
- A bad haircut
- Smashing my eyebrow piercing into my face on a door
(Those 2 were within a month 5 months ago)
- Unknown, twice

What happens is I get anxious for a long time. Minutes or even hours before it happens. I cry, which only seems to happen when I go through these episodes. I get emotional, tearful and irritable. I start to have thoughts about hurting myself, breaking things, and screaming. When they peak, i start hyperventilating uncontrollably. I seem to lose a lot of control. I start to kick my legs and scratch myself. I shake and have moments where I tense up completely. My mind races and I keep backing myself into mental walls. I can't control any of it. Eventually they slow down and I can take some control over the situation, but usually I still feel shaky and panicky for a long time after.

Today I had a caffeine-induced one which lasted for 7 hours if you count the long time before when i was holding it off as I played video games with my sister. (Yeah, I'm never drinking that much coffee again...) The peak lasted for about 10 minutes and I almost had another full-blown one later on, but I managed to calm myself down before I could.

Yesterday I had one too. That one lasted for 2 hours at least. I hadn't had any coffee and I'm not sure what triggered it. For these past 2 ones it's possible they were triggered by the fact that I can't feel anything towards the things i cared about and the thought of it all made me feel trapped. I have no idea though.

This isn't a normal thing. Before that the only panic attacks I had were in September of last year, 5 months ago. They had clearer triggers.

So I guess, is that a normal thing? If not, what could have caused them? Are these even panic attacks or are they something else like anxiety attacks or something similar? Thanks for your help :)",18Feb2019,1
61,"I've been in and out of therapy since I can remember. Yet after all these years of problems, and multiple diagnosis not me or any of my more recent therapists have agreed with them.

69,"I am not cute, I am quirky, a little bit stupid, insecure, and kind. I'm a 5'3, 120lb, 18 year old blonde girl, who works at a grocery store while going to a 2 year college for business.

I have sort of a polish, small hooded eyes, puffy cheeks, thin sunken frowning lips look to me. Add 100 pounds and I have a very common type of face among Americans. I'm not cunning, I do not turn heads. However, sometimes I believe that a cute guy might be looking at me because he fancies me. It takes a long time, sometimes all the way at the end of the day for me to realize I was wishfully thinking. 

This is cognitive dissonance....believing something you know isn't true, or acting against what you believe. 

My biggest issue with this is believing some people to be ""losers"" and placing me somehow ""above"" them, but still below average people.

I'm too cool to hang with the ""weirdos"" who don't know how to pronounce their words, yet I speak softly and notice I could annunciate my words better to sound less like a ""loser."" What kind of un-self-aware idiot runs their words together? Apparently me, too! 

At the same time, I feel below the average person, who has their life together, has friends, and is established in a career. I like fish, dogs, guitar, violin, music, and some Netflix dramas. That's about all I know about me.


I feel like I come across to others as in the middle between normal and sore loser. But I can't forget sometimes how much of a complete loser I am in general. No friends, scared, shitty past, no solid identity or future. 

I'm like a ghost floating around, worried about vanishing and nobody noticing or having anything good to say about me. I'm always worried about being kidnapped, but at the same time, who would look at me and go, ""ooh, let's pick up THAT one!"" 

I've done my share of living. After being traumatized for 14 years I lived a great, drug-addicted two years with friends that ended in soil. (In retrospect, I slept with 6 guys, got used, emotionally toyed with, gaslighted, picked on, crazy made, and set up probably hundreds of times) That's about the extent of my social life. Since early 2017, I've been alone.


 I just have this constant back and forth, two coinciding beliefs about pretty much everything and it makes it really hard to know what I want, who I am, and if I really have a purpose here",18Feb2019,5
70,"So last week I had this weird period of my day where I felt like I wasn't there, kinda floaty and numb inside my body. It was difficult to control my body it was like it was on autopilot and whatever actions I tried to make it do didn't work or were super difficult like I was in a dream and trying to move. Everyone around me looked off and strange like those 3d simulations that look realistic until you look a little closer and realize they aren't real. After I started freaking out more about the fact I couldn't fucking move hands I broke down in class.  I actually didn't remember too much about my numb period apart from what my friends told me. They said I sounded so confused and kept repeating what I was saying and for the rest of the day found it harder to remember certain memories, my eyes were all glazed and I was acting differently. Even now I'm still finding things confusing and having to think for a while to remember certain memories. 

After a while I felt more 'there' and even though I felt a sort of numbness every now and again for the rest of the day in my limbs I felt better. I thought it was over and just some weird episode,  but it happened again the next day but this time with a voice, I was walking to school the usual way I do and I just had this thought that didn't feel like my own, it told me I should just skip school, walk away to the harbor and drown myself. It was strange as usually when I'm having suicidal thoughts it usually follows a line of thought and I always feel depressed and choked up about it. But this time I was just detached like I was reading the lines to a script, I actually started walking the other direction and started thinking of whether I should jump with my laptop and bag or leave it. Thankfully I turned back around but I still felt off the entire day. When I came back home I was just randomly crying and spacing off and I was just lying on my bed about to sleep when I had a panic attack, a normal occurrence I have very bad attacks but its usually because of a trigger. It was the first time it just happened for no reason. 

Over the weekend it continued I felt hours of numbness and kept hearing violent words both to myself and others and then all of a sudden id feel better and happy and then I would just breakdown cry, feel anxious and paranoid. All through this, the voice would come back and just tell me ways I could hurt myself like grabbing the nearest object and beating my head with it. I'm just really fucking tired its hard to sleep and my body is so drained, I want it to stop and most of all I just feel guilty for freaking everyone around me I feel like I'm just bothering them and freaking them out with another one of my mental health problems. I just want it to stop already but I don't have any idea what it is or how to.

73,"I was very recently diagnosed with borderline personality disorder as well as anxiety, anxiety related insomnia, and severe depression from the previous improper diagnosis of Bipolar ii, and I was taking Paxil 20mg for 2 months. After my third change of psychiatrist, I was instructed to stop Paxil cold turkey in favor of staring prozac in 2 weeks because of the risks associated with adolescents taking Paxil. He is adamant on me stopping as soon as possible and I do understand why this is important, for the drug is **still not FDA approved for treating depression in teens even though it is commonly used for it**. I am currently 3 days in, and I am experiencing the full force of the withdrawals- Severe headaches and zaps, cold sweats, strange dreams and waking up in sweats, equilibrium and balance issues, tingling of extremities and numbness in hands, lightheadedness, suicidal ideation, dissociation, severe mood swings and racing thoughts. As someone very new to all of this and the processes associated with treatment, Id really appreciate anything, **and I mean anything**, anyone has to say about their personal experiences with withdrawals from Paxil or any antidepressant for that matter as well as any tips for managing this hell for the next 2 weeks. Thankfully, I am not currently enrolled in high school, so i am not forced to deal with this while stuck in class, but its challenging to go through this seemingly alone without contact from others. **Appreciate any feedback or thoughts I can get.**",18Feb2019,1
74,"Hello, im an average guy in my 20’s living with my lovely girlfriend, i have been very stressed out during 2018 and i did some things i really really regret now after ”waking up” from the stress.
Long story stort; I got a new job in 2018 wich really put me to the test, i have been very stressed out and constantly searching for things that would make me calm down so to speak, as many of you redditers know, porn is a great relief for some even though nobody wants to admit it. I have a pretty unusual fetish that i didnt want to drag my girlfriend into, as i thought it would scare her off and leave me if i told her, this made me use porno related to this fetish instead of forcing it on her, it never harmed our sexlife though.
Months went by and i found a website for people with this fetish, i dont know why but i started chatting with random girls on there who had the same fetish, exchanging pics anonymously etc, mark my words, i have never sent a pic of myself naked, never shown more than my upper body, and that was sent by request. It wasnt pure sexchatting but still pretty innapropriate, again, 100% anonymous still.
I was asked by someone in this website to upload a pic of my girlfriend as i had talked about my problem and mentioned her being unaware of my fetish, so i cropped the face out and everyrhing that could recognize her from the picture and uppladed it, nothing 100% naked. People started saying like wow, shes so pretty etc, this made me feel so damn good, i loved the attention her pictures got. After a few minutes i deleted the pic and told myself that it was the first and last time, then a few days later i would repeat it all again, uploading and deleting, day after day.
Time went by and i didnt think too much of it, until january this year when things started to calm down at work, then i suddenly reslized what i had done, i started feeling a huge wave of anxiety and panic, because this was not who i really am, i would never do something like that i mean.
I felt that i had to tell her about it, so i did, i had a mental breakdown and just cried and cried while telling her, i made it clear to her that i would never ever touch another woman IRL and i dont understand how i could ”dirty chat” with others online like that. I also told her that i uploaded pics of her and all that, she took it very well and we are actually getting engaged as i promised myself to ask her IF she forgave me, but i just CANT FORGIVE MYSELF!
I feel like the worlds most disgusting man alive, i love my gf more than words can describe and i would never ever cheat on her, none of us really consider this chatting as cheating as i never have sent or asked for fully naked pics or having Cam sex etc, but i feel so god damn horrible for chatting with others and uploading sensitive pics of her..
Reddit, please help me! I WILL NEVER do those things again and i feel like i have been a different person during that time!
What the hell am i to do? Can this behaviour have been caused by stress without me noticing it? Is my guilt a sign of me being myself again? It was so hard telling her, i have never ever done anything so hard in my life. I have a battle in my brain right now, i cant seem to stop thinking about this.
Please, help me find a way to ease my pain.
Thank you in advance.",18Feb2019,0

My mom passed away when I was 11 and it devastated me and I’m still not over it, I want to get over it, but I can’t. I don’t cry about anything except when it’s her, I don’t get that upset about anything except when it involves her. 

Basically being long distance with my girlfriend I came off as distant and cold in person so long distance it’s worse. Well tonight she texted me and said she’s done and I’m not too heartbroken over it, but the thing is that I love she’s everything I could want in a person, i mean sometimes she annoyed me, but I loved spending me time with her, she made me happy. What scares me I’m not hurt by it at all. I mean I feel sad about it, but ever since I saw my mom get wheeled out of house on a stretcher I haven’t felt anything that awful and it’s scary. 

I’m scared I’ll go through life not feeling anything, just numb to every feeling on this beautiful planet. 

Anyways long story short, any suggestions on how to love and feel again? I’ve been going on and off to counselingservices since she passed and I’m going bi weekly now. What else should I do? I don’t want to feel like this anymore, I want to actually feel love the way my girlfriend loved me.

80,"Hello everyone,

some info about me, i'm 33, male, single for 3 years now (came out of a 5 year relationship), living alone, got a few friends but not a very active social life.
My friend told me several times that i should seek out a psychologist and that i show signs of a depression but she isn't really an expert on the subject and neither am i so i'm just looking for some opinions and maybe advice.

It's been a long time since i was able to say that i'm fine. Most of the time i don't think i feel anything at all ... everything is just so dull. I have nothing that i really look forward to, recently i'm not having with my hobbies, which are mainly video games, anime/manga and cosplay.
I also get emotional fast and react angry, especially towards friends when i don't really have to react that way. I'm lucky i have patient and forgiving friends that want to help me and aren't angry at me for long ... since i'm mostly angry with myself afterwards and i really hate myself in these situations ... Well i should say i hate myself even more.

For a long time i could kind of keep these feelings in check by keeping my mind occupied, buying new games, working a lot, working out ... but that doesn't seem to cut it anymore.
I don't know how much of this is because of my loneliness. I'm pretty much feeling lonely all the time. Especially lately since my ex-GF (who is also still a good friend of mine) got a new boyfriend and is pretty happy. I don't love her anymore, that i'm sure of. But it still kind of ... sucks. I don't even know why. Maybe it's just envy.

Right now i just feel like there is nothing in this world that's keeping me here. I work, go home, watch stuff and play games, go to bed, get up ... rinse and repeat. But it's not fulfilling or fun ... it all seems so meaningless.
I just sat here for half an hour, head in my hands ... not knowing what to do. I just hate what my life is right now.

I rambled a bit i guess ... i don't know what i'm even expecting by writing this since all someone can say is ""just try a psychologist"". I actually have one right next door and since i live in Germany the first hour is free anyway. But i just can't get myself to make an appointment ... 

Well anyway, thanks for reading. ",18Feb2019,1

82,"Like I said in the title, last week I thought I was having a heart attack. Let me explain:

Since high school I started questioning authority and having trouble keeping up with the life that others seem keep up just fine, like the routinely trip to school/work, the 8 hours a day grind thing, etc. Now I'm 23 and my knowledge is greater as well as my anger. I'm currently a software developer, working 8 hours a day for a company that I don'l like. I've been dwelling with alternative routes, ways of being happy, ways of undermining this modern slavery. This is getting me more and more anxious, less sleep, more frustrated and hopeless. As my knowledge increases, as I investigate wars, social media phenomenons, mass culture, conflicts, rich men's games, economy, capitalism, you name it, my hope shrinks further.  This added to the fact that I have to get up at the same hour to take the same trip to sit in the same chair looking at the same thing 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, till I'm 66 years old, is getting me depressed. I have loads and loads of hobbies, I love photography/videography, playing drums/guitar/instruments in general, riding my bike, quadcopters, etc etc etc. I just have no time or mental state to do so. I found myself spending the money I earn on these hobbies just to realize I have no time to do them at all. And when I get home I just feel like smoking a J and watch Youtube/Netflix and f\*ck all. Sometimes I don't even want to talk to my GF,  I just want to lie down and try to get out of my mind...Some thoughts have been crossing my mind and I'm thinking of resigning and take some time off to do something else, but ""something else"" has to be something that generates income. I thought of online poker but I now that poker is really harsh on the mental aspect.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that you understand the context, let me explain what I experienced last week:

I vaped some weed before going to bed, as I usually do, went to wash my teeth, pee and then to bed. In bed my mind revolves around everything, the possibilities, the problems, the solutions, etc. This is usual as well. Then I started shaking, feeling more anxious and unwell. I decided to get up, take a deep breath and go wash my face. I went back to bed feeling a bit better. 1/2 minutes in, I started shaking again, worse than before. Got up again and thought of grabing a cup of milk to relax a bit. As I try to crouch to grab the milk carton I realize I'm really shaking bad and I couldn't get the milk. Now I know I've never felt this before. I stand again, without the f\*cking milk, and check my pulse to see  what's up. I could see it was beating fast, really fast. I pulled out my phone's stopwatch and started counting the heart rate pulses for 30 sec. 82 heart beats so my heart was beating 164 bpm. I never felt my heart beating so fast so I thought best to wake up my GF in case things took the wrong turn. I was lucid and relatively calm throughout all of this. Around 5 minutes went by of me talking to my GF describing what I was feeling and suddenly I felt dizzy and almost passing out. It was at this time that I decided we should head to the hospital to check what was happening. The car was parked like 200/300m from our house so we started walking and I was feeling a bit better so I decided to ask her to walk further just to see if we could avoid a trip to the hospital, guessing this was just an anxiety/panic attack. I was feeling way better, talking to my GF about unrelated stuff, making jokes and whatnot when I suddenly felt chest pain and my left arm went numb. This time I immediately turned back and started walking really fast towards the car. I really thought I was going through a heart attack. All the way to the hospital I'm trying to breathe deep, trying to keep my GF calm and tell her the route to the hospital as I'm shaking uncontrolably and starting to mumble words. When we get to the hospital I tell the guy I think I might be having a heart attack and they ask me about my address, phone number and tell me to pay 16 euros (can you f\*cking believe this?). After that I went to the nurse and she just though I took some drugs, more than I could handle (I need to state that I'm used to smoking weed since I'm 16 years old). She kept asking me if I took something as I replied that I was lying on my bed and I didn't take anything. She measured my heart rate to find it was \~160bpm and my blood pressure was like 16.something, also really high. She asked again if I wasn't taking anything for ""this"". The next nurse or doctor (the hospital is really bad so I don't even know if they had any doctors available) also kept asking me if I didn't take anything and just gave me a pill, which I had to ask what pill was that and what was going to do, cause I'm curious about drugs in general and hate prescription drugs. Turns out it was a Valium. My heart rate droppped (80 something) as well as my blood pressure. I went home and woke up the next day (skipped work obviously) to find I was still shaking a bit and felling a disconfourt on my chest. I went to another doctor to explain the situation and they just tell me it's anxiety and lack of sleep and prescribe me Victam and some vitamines. I'm taking the vitamines but I refuse to take Victam. I've done an electrocardiogram and some blood analysis but everything seems normal, my heart just as a bit of arrhythmia but doesn't look too serious.

I'm sharing this with you my dear reddit friends to find if this is normal among anxious and depressed people.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; I started trembling really hard to the point I couldn't grab a cup of milk. My heartrate was through the roof, I felt some chest pain and my left arm went numb. Went to the hospital just to take a Valium and got sent home again. I've done an electrocardiogram and some blood analysis and everything seems okay.

83,"Hi, just for a bit of context, I'm 19 years old, male and I live in the UK.

&amp;#x200B;

I've struggled a bit with mental health in my past, specifically a stretch of depression throughout my teens and some ongoing but mild social anxiety.

&amp;#x200B;

But that's not what I need help with today.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I've been feeling down in the dumps. Constantly tired, short on breath as if doing anything at all takes all my effort, having headaches and at some points blurred vision and feeling as if I'm going to collapse. While this is worrying and I am definitely going to see a doctor about it the thing I need advice on is how to bring up some horrible thoughts I have been having alongside all this.

&amp;#x200B;

I keep having thoughts of wanting to hurt or even kill those around me and frankly it's driving me insane. I feel like all it's going to take is me being in the wrong place at the wrong time and it's going to make me snap and do something I'll regret.  I need someone to talk to about it in confidence but don't know where to start at all. I'm worried about bringing it up because I feel like it's going to lead to more trouble or the police getting involved or something.

&amp;#x200B;

I really just need some advice on what I should do, who I should talk to, what will happen after etc.

84,"Hi All,

I (F, 24) have been depressed for quite some time now, I think around 3 years after my ex dumped me. It had its ups and downs, but at this point I am at an all time low wherein my friends start to give up on me as well (and I do not blame them). In March, I will go back to therapy (OCD, anxiety) but at this moment I feel like nothing will solve my problems and I will just continue to be the lonely disgusting person I am already.  
For me, the problem right now is that somewhere inside me I do have my passions, dreams and motivations to accomplish goals like working out more often, finish my master thesis and enjoying a hobby. I am so mad at myself that I gave up. However, the ongoing thought about me being worthless and an evil person continuously hinders me in order to finally start with what I want to do. Simply said, I do not deserve to be happy since I 'screwed up' so much in my life Thus, instead, I lay in my bed and try to sleep away the day in order to give myself a break from all these thoughts (which makes me feel even more worthless of course).

I was wondering if there are any other people here who encountered such negative thoughts as well, and how they deal(t) with them. I was quite hesitant with creating this post, but at this point I feel like something really needs to change, because it is starting to damage my overall wellbeing, and creating more hurtful habits (drinking, purging, overeating etc). At this point, I only feel happy when I am under influence (alcohol) or when my mind is totally distracted (extremely loud music for example). I just dont understand how I ended up this way. I used to have so many interests, be healthy, even modelled a few times, good grades.. Now I only 'care' because I know it is expected from me. 

Thank you for listening:)",18Feb2019,1
85,"After writing this, I realise it’s a lot longer than I was expecting it to be - sorry 

For context, I’m a 16 year old female living in the UK

I’m going to the doctors tomorrow for reasons unrelated to my mental health. I can see this is an opportunity to open up and try to get help but the problem is I don’t know how to talk about it. I have always hated talking about anything to do with myself, I prefer to stay in the background with no attention on me. Also I’m not good with my words and I can never seem to explain things the way I want to so I am often misunderstood. I’m worried they won’t understand the full extent of what I’m trying to say. 

I can’t talk to my parents about this because not only are they having problems themselves, but my dad is struggling with severe depression and my mum, as much as I love her and she tries, she just doesn’t understand. She just tells me that everything is fine and to ‘stop being silly’. I also can’t talk to my friends because again, none of them understand (I know this because I’ve tried to talk to them before) and also I’m not that close to any of them. My only friend who I would talk to lives sooooo far away and is also struggling herself so I don’t want to bother her with my problems. I guess I’m just feeling really lonely at the moment, ontop of everything else. 

I realise I haven’t actually said what’s going on mental health wise- it’s because tbh I don’t really know. It seems than everything is wrong. I seem to be feeling every negative emotion there is. I am EXTREMELY sad all the time but for no reason. I don’t think I have anything to be sad about. Also one of my big problems is how anxious I get, mostly in social situations. I don’t really leave my house if I don’t have to but when I do have to, for school and work, I can’t relax the entire time. I’m always on edge, my heart is constantly beating at a billion beats per minute, I breath funny, my brain just throws all these negative thoughts around. I hate it and I hate myself. The negative thoughts I mention stop me from sleeping. I haven’t had a proper, good 8 hours for probably 3 years now. 3 hours is a good night for me. Then there is my fucked up relationship with food. I get sad/anxious so I binge on food for like 3-5 days straight. Then I feel like absolute shit about myself and eat next to nothing for the next 3-5 days. When I say I hate myself, I’m not joking or exaggerating. I genuinely HATE myself 

I know all this is bad and I should have probably gone to get help sooner but I just don’t know how to talk to people about it. Even making this post right now is freaking me out. I don’t have any posts on a single social media account of mine because it stresses me out too much. 

I’m not sure what my question is or what the point of this post is. I guess just to vent, maybe try to understand what’s going on. I’m not sure. I just don’t know how to talk to someone and I’m scared about going to the doctors. I’m worried I’m going to miss this opportunity to get help just because I don’t know how to talk about what I need help with. 

Okay I’m done now i guess",18Feb2019,1

87,"Without going to deep into it, I'm a 29 year old man. Father of 2 boys and husband to a beautiful wife. I use to be in the military, and while I did not experience any PTSD type ""stuff"" I still had a very difficult transition to being a civilian after my service. Going from having all bills paid and great health insurance, to having nothing and having to rebuild has been tough for me. The last 3 years I have barely been making ends meet while we go further and further into debt. The stress is becoming overwhelming and I don't know how to cope with it. My entire life has been relatively cushioned (Great loving parents who supported me and even paid for my associate's degree while living at home, then I went into the military where they take care of everything).  So I guess my issue is, I don't know how to manage the ""stressors of life"" 

What I'm seeking is a good book recommendation. I'm open to anything that can help me assess and manage what's going on in my life either through direct advice and/or indirect advice that I can draw conclusions from. 

I went to see a doctor however the very first thing he did was try to write me a prescription. As someone who has witnessed firsthand what ""pills"" can do to people, and acknowledging that I have an addictive personality, I refuse to take them. I feel like this is an issue I can solve on my own through advice and meditation. I just need some guidance and a good book would really help.

88,"I'm trying to understand what happened to me, and I wasn't sure where else to turn.  Hopefully someone here can shed some light on the event and possibly help me attain it again.

I suffer from depression and anxiety, have for a long while, but more recently my psychiatrist believes there are markers of cyclothemia also.  I take Cipralex and Wellbutrin, and back in the summer we added Lamictal, which seemed to help a great deal.  Since that time I had tapered off of the Cipralex (5mg, down from 20mg, for penis reasons).  For a long while I have been stable and happy, but during the last two weeks my wife could notice that I wasn't quite myself: more anxious, more worried.

On Wednesday, I had what was possibly the worst mental day that I can recall.  Significant depression, irrational fear (of things at work), suicidal ideation, etc.  I became so bad that I ended up falling asleep at 8pm, then woke up at 3am.  For the first 10 minutes after waking, I felt good, quite good actually.  But soon enough, my brain started trying to retrieve all the things I was worried about before I slept.   By 3:30 I was fully panicked again.  Got up and shoveled snow outside for something to do.  I could hear that little voice in my head, depression personified: just go lay in the ditch.  Cover yourself with snow.  Freeze to death.  End everything.  It was a terrible morning.

Now on Thursday night, my wife and I vaped some cannabis (a new activity) after a good dinner (large helping of salmon).  Had a great time, felt great, went to bed still high.  The next morning, things felt normal; I was no longer severely depressed.  But then, something odd and incredible happened.  I live in Quebec City, so as an American I've been learning French for the last three years.  I've gotten decent at it, but I still struggle with my comprehension of others.  This morning though, things were clear.  SO CLEAR.  I could speak, I could understand, I had zero need to revert to English.  When I got to work, it was like I was feeling a rush of positive energy.  And I couldn't stop speaking in French!  It was so easy that I actually found it hard to revert back to English, like my brain wanted to stay Francophone.  My colleagues were amazed.

The day just felt like it was planned out and I was fulfilling it.  I was solving technical problems without even thinking.  I was doing work without having to concentrate.  I was talking and laughing with everyone, being more social than normal.  The only way I could explain it to people was that my head, was SILENT.  Normally I have all kinds of shit going on up there: what I need to do, the last song I heard, noises, etc.  But today, it was just... quiet.  Nothing could bother me.  I also felt like my sense of self was different.  How do I explain this... it felt like I had taken one half step back from between my ears, almost like I was partially phased out of my self, giving me extra time and perception.

It was an incredible day.  Towards the evening the glow started to taper off, but it was an amazing experience.  But then when I went to sleep, woke back up, and?  It was gone.  I wasn't in a terrible place, but I wasn't... there, anymore.  I've tried replicating it since then.  Eating the same food, vaping the same strain, etc, but I haven't recreated it yet.  I don't even know if it was just a fluke, but the chemistry between my ears that day was... it was perfect.  I want it back.

Was it the cannabis?  Was it a bipolar swing back from the brink?  What the fuck was it?  Was I just still a little high, enough that it just carried me through the morning and opened my mind up enough to put me on the right track for the entire day?  I'm at a loss, and I don't even know what to look for or how to comprehend it.  All I know if that I would love to have it back.",18Feb2019,1
89,"There's just no connection, everything I do regarding them seems fake. I feel nothing regarding them, yet they like me and I was even told I have a big heart. I actually paint/draw almost wholesome portraits for money sometimes, but I go about it in an objective calculating kind of way. People have cried when receiving them, but I'm only painting what I know they will like. I've also had very violent fantasies (to the point of obsession sometimes) since I was a kid. Sexual and non sexual. If that part's an ""edgy phase"" it's lasted almost 15 years. The thing is, that I'm not even concerned about it. Sometimes I reflect on it because I'm interested in psychology. So I'm wondering why I would be like this. How many other people are like this? And I think it's kind of funny how you never really know someone, most people seem to assume I'm innocent or naive.

90,"My somewhat shortened backstory behind my depression, my father is an alcoholic, he was obsessed with my mom, and put us into hiding. We'd move almost once a month because he'd always find us. He stalked my mom and I until we fled to Texas when I was 5. I have very vivid memories of him beating the shit out of her, luckily there was always something to interfere, then he'd run away. 5 and up, I was abused physically, verbally, and sexually by different people. I never told my mom. She raised me herself, and she was always working. So basically I raised myself at home. I took all of the burden with a smile. That is until I was 14, when my mind caved in one day. I've been severely depressed since then. 
 I've had chronic clinical depression for 8 years, since then. I've been hospitalized for it twice, one of the times was because I attempted suicide. I really thought I wanted to die, so I swallowed 20 ambien. Quickly after I took them, it hit me, what I just did. I realized in that moment that wasn't what I wanted, that I wanted to keep fighting,  so I called 911 on myself, and barely survived. 
After that, I had a new outlook on life. I still had this pain, but I felt like I was able to handle it in a new way. 
That was 6 years ago. In the meantime, I got married, and had the chance to move to Alaska. I loved being so far away from my home state. It helped me to cope with all that happened to me. It feels like I've come to accept all that happened to me, but now I just feel empty..
I had a best friend from ages 15-19. My whole life I felt alone, so I started trying drugs and alcohol at 15. He took me aside one night to try and sway me from this life style. He was the only person who ever took an interest in me the way he did. So I stopped. We basically were together all day every day. I think I became reliant on him. Which made it all the more difficult, when I lost him. He became an awful person later, and developed a horrible god complex. I was 19 when my wife came along, and saw him from an outside perspective. He wasn't the same person, and I didn't even notice. She helped me to get away from him, despite him stalking me. We decided on a separate note around that time, on a whim,  to move to Alaska. Shortly before the move though, I developed a serious case of depersonalization. 
I really loved my 2 years there, and it made the depersonalization manageable, but I didn't have enough job experience to make it, so we moved back home. We've been back here a little over a year now. I hate being here, and have become plagued with anxiety, and extreme depression. I'm at an all new low, and my depersonalization has become severe because of that. There's nights where I can't even feel my body, because my mind is so split from reality. I feel like a broken man, a husk of the boy who woke up in the hospital. If I even try to face the numbness, i'm sent spiraling into an existential crisis. So I just live in autopilot. My life has been flipped upside down. The best friend that I knew is basically dead to me, my family is all distant, and I just feel so alone.. I feel so broken and insecure, I've fallen to the point again where I just want to die. I'm sick of the state of the world, and feel like it doesn't matter what I do, or where i am, because at any moment, a fucking nuke just might fall out of the sky and annihilate any life i make. 
I decided last night after deeply considering suicide, to get help. But I don't even know how.. I don't know what doctors to call, and I don't have insurance. Selfishly I wish I wasn't married. She's the only reason I don't end it right now. I feel like I've always tried to be kind, and tried to be a good person. But maybe that's why i'm at this point..",18Feb2019,1
91,"I am a drug addict. I am feeling extreme depression. I take Provigil, Effexor, clonazepam and risperidone.

I am relatively sober from drugs a long time, but my life has lost any sense. I hate myself because of things I have done. I just want to cry and or escape this pain.

I feel that I can't forgive myself and no one loves me. My own family mistreats me. Some hate me. My ex-gf is a drug user and is with another addict. She doesn't answer me nomore. I am a shame to everyone in my neighborhood. I am going through hell and have suicidal thoughts. My arms are full of deep wound cuts. My dad told me ""if you cut yourself again you will go to the psych ward."" I want to run on the street screaming and flee from everyone.

92,"I've debated posting this for a little bit now but I'm running out of options. My life has been crumbling apart and I have no idea what to do. I can't talk about it to other people because either 
A. They turn it into being about themselves and just get mad at me.
B. Tell me I need to be put on medication because my mind isn't there.
or C. They ignore me and avoid me in general, and act like they don't notice (which maybe they don't)

It is a bit of a lengthy back story but it needs to be said before it literally explodes in my head. 

Growing up, my mother is/was an absolute control freak. Constant control over my life and telling me what is and isn't correct in life. (Really never allowing me to learn things on my own which later leads to me rebelling and becoming sneaky) My dad is one of those people that USUALLY just sits back and lets my mom call all of the shots. Growing up my parents would not let me due normal kids things (for my area) e.a football games, church groups, after school events. I wasn't even allowed to go to the public pool. My door was removed off my bedroom SEVERAL times, and just at random. 
Constant text messages and calls asking to tell her where i was, when i got there, who was there, etc.. In middle school/high school I had no choice but to do this. NOW I am 22 years old and it is still happening. Even to the point where if I don't let her know when I'm home, she claims i'm avoiding her. Present day she has threatened me multiple times about my living situation and life choices. Even to the point of telling me who I can and cannot be in a relationship with. 

At this point what i've been through isn't even just telling, she has made multiple threats telling me if I try to get out of the area, or date a certain person that she will disown me, and take everything I have. (Which at this point, means nothing) 
My dad and her have fully admitted to my younger brother that they will have not the slightest issue disowning me and never speaking to me again. 

Now changing subjects there is a third person involved. 

In high school I ended up falling in absolute love with my boyfriend at the time's best friend. We started out just friends with no intention of it becoming any more than that. Well we instantly had a connection that pulled us both in. It was the type of feeling of needing someone, like they complete you. They fill in the missing pieces. He understood me more than I understood myself. Unfortunately the relationship eventually did become toxic. I was almost terrified of this person, due to threatening messages. I was also toxic in the situation because in this moment I can admit I lead the person on, and essentially messed with his head. Deep down, i absolutely loved him. Around 5 years ago that relationship was cut off, due to the toxic issues in it. 

** Please note that I never stopped caring about this person, the issues were there but I never stopped loving them. I thought of him constantly for the years apart. He was and always has been my weakness. Even in the bad moments I absolutely would've done anything for him. **

Fast forward 5 years and we became on speaking terms. We hadn't spoken a word to each other since the toxic relationship. When we spoke presently I can see that he has changed. He isn't what he was before, he found himself in that time period apart. He is no where near the same person he was before. But he doesn't trust me, due to our past. He can't seem to see that I would do absolutely anything for him. Even go through what I did, I don't blame him once today. I feel like I can't win though. He can't seem to heal the trust from our past. I have forgiven him for what he did to me, and accepted that the past is in the past for a reason. That we can be better... 

But he isn't noticing everything, he isn't seeing I'm crumbling and trying so hard  to make him feel loved and to know he's loved that I'm breaking apart. 

My parents won't accept him due to the past. Which I understand but also find un fair. If I can forgive, they should be able to. 
My dad has even physically harmed this person due to us being in contact again. And now there is MASS amounts of resentment there.

My parents have blamed me for everything bad happening in their life. He just won't accept that he is loved. 
I recently lost my job. 
Every person I worked with that I considered a close friend ignores my text messages or is short with me. 

I feel that I have no friends, and no one that I can talk to at this point because I'm just told what I'm doing wrong. 

I'm running out of options and hope at this point. I feel like I can't win. I feel like I'm drowning and no one is noticing.

I need help, on what to do. I feel like I'm being screamed at and wronged from every angle. Sometimes I think everyone here would be better off if I was gone. What do I do?",18Feb2019,1

Around that same age, I clicked on a YouTube video with an inappropriate title one day, immediately exited out, and spent weeks-months considering killing myself thinking I had committed some cardinal sin and was headed for hell (I was raised in a secular household so this makes zero sense). I became a severe germaphobe in 5th grade to the point where my hands cracked and bled from all the soap-washing. I could continue on with these paranoid delusions for pages and pages, but that’s not the point of this post.

My warped perception of the world as a child is haunting me. No one in my immediate family got me professional help until my parents got sick of me sleeping on the floor and sent me to a therapist. I harbor no anger against them for this late attempt to help, as I never told them the extent of my childhood delusions until recently (I didn’t even know they were delusions!). I’ve been on medications/in therapy since then (6th grade) but relapse every few months/years. I feel as though the help was almost too late; I am diagnosed with depression/anxiety/OCD/PTSD on paper but I know there’s something...missing. 

It would be different if I grew out of my delusions. In a way, they more so grew with me - they take more subtle forms nowadays, rational enough that they keep me constantly doubting my own sanity. The delusions get especially intense whenever I experience external troubles. For example, I hit one of my “rough patches” in 6th grade due to severe bullying, and again junior year of high school because of academic pressure. 

Finally, to the point of this essay: I am now a freshman in college. Almost everything that could go wrong for a freshman has for me, and this has caused complete chaos for my previously dormant delusions. I’m terrified something will happen to my family while I’m away. This paranoia was furthered last year when my mother (during a particularly inebriated episode) fell down the stairs and practically shattered her ribcage; obviously, this has only heightened the separation anxiety. I have made zero friends while I’ve been here, and not from lack of trying; I am a pretty social person and the isolation has been killing me. I had to move mid-year from my first dorm due to issues with my roommate and now live in a single. The loneliness is dangerous here. All of these circumstances combined with (1) limited access to a healthy diet and (2) severe insomnia is physically and mentally destroying me. I’ve found myself making very shaky, even dangerous choices lately when it comes to just about everything. I have regular phone appointments with my psychiatrist that do absolutely nothing for me. I tell her how I feel and all she does is insist on calling me more frequently. 

I have never been less in control of my own life which is COMPLETELY contradictory to the whole “college is freedom” thing. I am miserable. I am scared. I do not feel like myself at all. I find no humor in things anymore; that might be what concerns me the most. I’m not passionate about anything. I crave physical touch (literally just hugs. just human contact.) but feel absolutely nothing when I receive it. I feel as though the world is spinning at a much faster pace than I am living at. 

I’m not even drowning quietly; I confide in my friends, family, and my psychiatrist about how I feel but no one seems to know what to do. In fact, some of my friends have distanced themselves once I tell them of the poor choices I made, and I don’t really blame them. Never swim near a sinking ship or you’ll go down with it, right?",18Feb2019,4

105,"I suffer from occasional isolated episodes of paranoia/irrational fear.

The reason I'm making this post is because I'm in the middle of such an episode now - but I don't want to go into the details of that. 

But a good example of these episodes happens nearly every Christmas when my work organises a special lunch outing to a restaurant in the centre of the city. For weeks before this lunch I experience increasing anxiety focused on the idea that the restaurant will be caught up in a terrorist attack. The first year it happened was the worst. I could not get my mind to think of anything else for over a week before the event. My mind filled with horrific images almost every moment. It was the first Christmas after the terrorist attacks in Paris - I'm sure that was a trigger. It was the closest I've ever felt to being 'mad' - and I was aware of it, but I could not control it. On the way to the lunch I felt like I could be travelling to my death, and at the restaurant itself I was overwhelmed by fear and found it difficult to act normally. The fear did not subside till I had left the restaurant. 

In subsequent years I have had similar episodes, always focused on the Christmas lunch. At other times of year I go to restaurants in town without thinking of these things and am completely relaxed. 

At the moment I'm experiencing a similar episode about an entirely different situation. The feelings, sleepless nights and clearly imagined terrible events are the same, but the context is different. I'm sure it comes from the same place as the Christmas lunch fear. 

I want to know how seriously should I be taking these experiences? I have very little money and am unable to pay for a therapist. Are such irrational fears or paranoia common? Where do they come from? ",18Feb2019,1

Such people do not have individual dysfunctions but are responding naturally to undesirable losses in their lives(Horwitz and Wakefield 2007). **The failure to include exclusions other than bereavement enhances the reliability of the MDD diagnosis because clinicians and researchers might disagree on whether or not depressive symptoms represent appropriate contextual responses.**""

114,"I'm 30 and have always been a worrier, even from a young age. I started flying when I was 8 and never had an issue until I was about 16 or 17 and experienced some pretty rough turbulence over the Atlantic. I've flown a handful of times after that, but in recent years, my anxiety has gotten worse and evolved in ways that makes the idea of flying difficult.

Last year, I was meant to fly to New Orleans with my Wife, but came down with a nasty cold a couple days before the trip and had to stay behind. Miraculously, a day after she left, I was fine. This leads me to believe my anxiety was behind the cold to a certain degree. Now, I'm supposed to fly down to New Orleans one-way, by myself in mid March so that I can take the drive back home with my brother in law. 

This is something I not only want to do, but *need* to do. I know that I can't be paralyzed by my fear forever. My main fears are feeling trapped; my stomach drops whenever I think of the flight attendant closing the big door and knowing I'm past the point of no return; I'm also scared of something happening in the air that would prevent us from having a safe landing, such as the landing gear not deploying or something; the idea of circling in the air, not knowing whether or not we'll be able to land safely drives me insane.

I plan on seeing my doctor for some anxiety meds before the flight, but I know I can't count on them to fully cure me of my anxiety. I don't want to limp onto this plane and be a miserable human being on the verge of full-blown panic the entire time. I really want to enjoy my trip.

I was diagnosed with extreme anxiety and depression back in June. I've been on a few medications to combat them, and currently I am on Wellbutrin.

My question is, how do I know if the Wellbutrin helped my depression?

So I used to have chronic loneliness and just a sense of emptiness sitting inside me forever, I barely have energy for anything. That is the summary. 

But for the last month, I decided that I will add one thing to my morning routine to improve my mental health and that is cleaning my room/studio. I know a lot of people find this difficult and challenging. So what I did was to clean my room one time thoroughly, take a picture of it, and then everyday I just put things back into where they were in the picture. Gradually, I remember where they are, and cleaning becomes something automatic. I also threw away/donated things I never touched in the past months. The point is, you need to clear your way into a better life, you cannot move on to a better mental state having your physical environment the same. 

YOUR PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT IS THE MANIFESTATION OF YOUR INNER MENTAL STATE. 

So when you clean your room, you're nudging yourself to getting better, having a clean and tidy room is the first symbolical step you need to have a clearer mind. 

I haven't miss a single day since I decided to start cleaning my room for 10 mins every morning. It is also an activity to distract myself from negative thought process :)

But as soon as I started my new job I had a break down because of unrelated reasons and ended up having a depressive episode that lasted two months, so all my plans got cancelled and I had to quit my job. I isolated myself from anything and anyone, because apparently that's my way of dealing with depression.

I’m constantly in fear of listening to certain songs or reliving old memories because if I do, unknown extradimensional forces will increase the probability of my death and ruin my friendships

Everything is connected to each other and everything is connected to me in some way, and with this knowledge I can manipulate the future just by thinking about it enough. Everything I’ve thought of heavily has come true, I mean everything too

I used to talk to a tapestry hanging on my wall begging it to go easy on my life. I was convinced the tapestry was some sort of catalyst for telepathic communication between me and an other worldly force that manipulated whatever happened in my life. If I didn’t talk to it enough, it’d fuck with my friendships. I somehow managed to fade away from that idea, and I still have the tapestry hanging up but now that I’m remembering it I’m gonna have to start communicating with it again so that’s cool ):

Everything in life is just weird and reality is so twisted and I know it is, I just don’t know in which ways. I just know I experience reality on a much different and higher plane than anyone else in the world, or at least most people - sometimes I’ll listen to interviews or podcasts and the way people speak resonates with the way I think so they must be on a higher plane as well. Not as high as me though

It’s getting to a point where, at night, I am beginning to hear rustling outside but I never check my window because I’m scared something dangerous will appear. I don’t know if the rustling is real or not but I’m still terrified nonetheless

It’s not just the delusions. I go through periods of not being able to perform basic tasks. I feel as stupid as a fucking brick sometimes, and on rare occasion it comes to a  point where I can’t string sentences together because words make little sense to me

Sometimes I have a nagging fear that reality is created solely for me, and that maybe I am my own reality and nothing is truly real. Or that everyone in my life is apart of a big extraterrestrial hoax to fuck with me and that they all created reality just for me to experience 

There are many more but those are just the big ones. I’m not even diagnosed with anything is the thing, I was never fully aware of these being delusions until just this year. Have been through some unfortunate events recently and have been a drug user for a bit (psychedelics, cannabis, brief bouts of opioid dependence and even deliriants at one point) but I’ve experienced these delusions ever since I was extremely little, and the drug use has done nothing to help or hurt my mental health honestly. I’ve been unwillingly sober for a while now, with the exception of very occasional light cannabis use that stopped recently, and the delusions are still there. 

I will admit that they were more intense while I was using more frequently, but like I said - I’ve always lived with them. I’m just kind of scared because I’m now beginning to realize that they aren’t real. But even though I know they’re not real a **huge** part of me cannot shake them out of my mind, I fall for them anyways.

I’ve dealt with what I’m assuming is some sort of depression for a while now as well. Some weeks worse than others, but for the majority of the time I’m either extremely annoyed and apathetic, and constantly tired, or extremely and uncomfortably, sometimes overwhelmingly anxious and sad for no reason. 

I want to see a psychologist but they’re just going to put me in a psychiatric hospital and pump me with drugs if I told them about this

131,"Hey!

I've recently started to think that I'm in capable of picking up new hobbies and STICKING to them, because old habits are either bringing me  too much nostalgia or my brain in the unconcious is too afraid of a change.

E.g I was a video game addict. I used to play 4-8h a day everyday for 10 years straight just purely video games. Now that I've recently turned 20 years old, I think it's a time for a change and even though I'm a university student, I can't seem to pick up any new habits. My brain is addicted to watching different screens, whether for watching youtube through my phone or reading homework through my PC screen.

I've tried to pick up new sports, such as boxing, fencing, swimming etc., but (in the unconcious) I rather prefer to stay at home and be behind a computer. I have always been fond of trying to be an educated person, so I tried to switch from wasting time to reading, but so far not so good. I've borrowed within a 6 month span around 20 different books, but I only end up reading a quarter of all these books, because I became at numerous cases instantly and just sticked to social media.

I've come to a realization that the interent has ruined me. The constant influx of information running through social media websites has made me an ADHD monkey without any patience. I acknowledge that I have a problem and I want to have a change.

I deactivated my social media accounts, cut down on my usage of the internet and trying to read more, yet reading is still almost impossible without skipping 10 lines in every 1-2 minutes.

Am I in the right direction of becoming more stable or am I going still in the wrong direction? What should I do to get rid of the old habits and replace with the new ones?

132,"And  then the nightmare begin. I don't even know her name, i don't even know  who she is. But i can't start thinking about her, i think about her in  the morning before sleep. I was trying to concentrate on the co-worker i  was angry on and still my tough directed me to her, i was trying to  paint models and couldn't concentrate, on Saturday i ran for 11  kilometres (i run first time in last two months, so you can imagine my  legs are hurting as hell) only to try to clear my head, and even then i  still was thinking about her.

I don't know if this is the right place to talk about it but i really need some help or even some kind of advice.

Let's set up a back ground for the situation.

Three  years ago i was on my lowest of the low (I'm 30 y.o now) i was single  for five years, hated my job, was overweight (had weight of 126kg) and  was smoking weed watching hentai's for 6 months every day thinking about  suicide (yeah i was in a very very deep sinkhole)

I  had a wake up call. Got fired from my job, called my friends on the  other side of the country (met them playing MMo's on team speak) asked  if i can move with them and if they could help me find a job and a place  to rent. Found a job, rented a place, started reading books, eating  healthy, started painting figures as a hobby, lost 40 kg of weight. Next  year i started jogging for sport (there was a time i was running around  10km in an hour) read even more, changed to one that requires more  interaction with people as a salesman, started going to dancing lessons,  started to learn how to swim. I also meditate once or twice a day and  for last two weeks im on no-fap.

I'm  saying all this only because i know that there will be people who will  tell me that i have to do more with my self and will propose exercise or  other kind of activities, i just want you to know, they are part of my  life now, so i need different advice.

OK now to the actual problem.

I  always think to much, i have great imagination.

Sometimes  i can get angry at someone that i didn't talk with for a month because i  was thinking about some stupid scenarios that never happened and only  when i talk with them i realize that there is no reason for me to be  angry at them. I become frustrated for no reason with my co workers for  example. One of them had to take a sick leave for two months, i hated  him so much i had so much bad stuff to tell about him but when he came  back today and started talking with me i didn't know where the anger  came from, i felt... dumb...

If this was  the only issue here then i wouldn't be writing about this but there is  more. In next two weeks my dancing school is organizing a party for all  the groups, i joined the school solo, i sometimes get some older married  women to dance with, and honestly i am really hoping that this party  will help me find a nice single girl who would at least want to go to  the school in a group for lessons (best case scenario met someone  interesting because i feel lonely and single)

Last  Thursday on valentines day, when i got to the school, i was passed by a  very cute girl from solo class before mine, she smiled to me and  blushed a little, i smiled as well but couldn't keep eye contact i was a  little too shy, cough off guard.

And  then the nightmare begin. I don't even know her name, i don't even know  who she is. But i can't start thinking about her, i think about her in  the morning before sleep. I was trying to concentrate on the co-worker i  was angry on and still my tough directed me to her, i was trying to  paint models and couldn't concentrate, on Saturday i ran for 11  kilometers (i run first time in last two months, so you can imagine my  legs are hurting as hell) only to try to clear my head, and even then i  still was thinking about her.

Is she going to be at the party?

Maybe i could ask her out?

Maybe she would want to go with me dancing?

Seriously  in the last four days i had in my head scenario of every conversation  every meeting, hell i even had at least 20 different visions of having  sex with her, cold showers don't work, swimming doesn't work, jogging  doesn't work. I think about her, about having sex with her, about dating  her, about even a fucking wedding. I feel sick, i can barely sleep, in  work i can't concentrate.

It's not the  first time this happens to me, every know and then i see a girl or i  talk with a girl and it goes on and on on a repeat.

I feel mentally ill.

I am tired.

I got so frustrated today, because of those tough i punched a wall in the room, my knuckles are bruised.

And the best part is... i'm going to go to the party and one of those three things will happen.

1. She won't be there
2. She will be with a boyfriend
3. She wont be interested even in dancing with me

And  no matter witch one of those things will happen, i will just  automatically stop thinking about her and the frustration will just  disappear. But till then, i still have two weeks of my head exploding  with stupid ideas, i don't want.

I just want it to stop.

I don't want to think any more.

Work doesn't help, exercise doesn't help.

I need any advice. Any before i get insane.",18Feb2019,2
133,"Like for example, if I'm afraid because I know if it sounds like I'm laughing at certain things (things you shouldn't be laughing at) I can't help but make a loud breath sound that sounds like one of those nose laughs (pushing air forcefully out of your nose to show you think it's funny) and it makes people think I'm laughing at their misery. That's why I stopped going to NAMI, because they said some things that would be horrible to laugh at(which I wasn't, but it sounded like I was), and they got upset or depressed. They have said things that show that's how they felt. A similar thing happens other times when I know I shouldn't react certain ways (and I'm not really)but I can't help but sound like I'm reacting those ways. I really don't want to, and I hate it. It happens even when I'm not anxious and even when I take multiple anxiety medicines.

134,"Hi!

My whole life, all of my family on my dad’s side has had a horrible relationship with my dad’s mother (my grandma). I didn’t really notice it until after my grandpa died back in 2005. She always brought up his death as a way to position herself in moral superiority and didn’t seem the least bit upset or affected when he died. That was the first red flag.

She later remarried in 2012 to her new husband, Bill. Bill is one of the meanest people I have ever met. Whenever they have visited our house, we have always been cordial. I always had to take care for Bill because he is very much handicapped. I always did so without complaint even though I can’t stand him. Whenever he talks, he’s so arrogant and drones on and on in the most monotone, boring voice ever. Not to mention, he mumbles to the point of being incomprehensible. Even though we treat him with hospitality, he repeatedly insults us and treats us like dirt. Me especially, even though I was the kindest to him. My grandma always defends him. That’s not what necessarily makes me think that she’s a sociopath.

My dad has two brothers: a biological brother (my uncle CR), and an adopted brother who I will call PB (Pedo Bear). PB was arrested back in 2010 for sexual material involving underage girls being found on his computer. Grandma always brings up PB to us grandkids, despite my dad and CR’s protests. She’s always trying to manipulate everyone. She tried to get my underage little sister to go behind our father’s back and come visit her in Ohio. PB lives with her!!! She wanted my little sister, who was only one year older than a girl he tried to prey on in the 90s, to be alone in a house with that monster! She doesn’t care about the safety of her children or grandchildren.

This isn’t the only thing. She contributed to the death of my grandfather by manipulating his Bipolar Disorder and enabling his alcoholism. He died from falling down the stairs at their house while drunk. Honestly, at this point, I can’t entirely rule out the possibility of her pushing him down the stairs herself. Her manipulating and abusing Bipolar people is a common theme.

She was extremely abusive to my father and CR when they were younger and that abuse hasn’t stopped.  She’s even abusive to me. She cussed at me in front of everyone during dinner because I asked her politely to move her chair. Said I was “a horrible granddaughter” and that I “treat her like shit”, even though I’ve done nothing but be hospitable to her and her prick of a husband. Then she gave me a fake apology. She scares me and the rest of my family because she’ll terrorize all of us to be the center of attention. 

My graduation is coming soon and I really don’t want her there because she starts drama and makes everything about her. Not to mention, her provocative and over the top behavior makes everyone physically ill. I’m afraid most for my dad, because he suffers already from heart problems and she makes him deathly sick from all the stress. I’m sad that it’s come to this. The last time I invited her to an important event of mine, she insisted on embarrassing me and started a huge fight with my mother. My mom doesn’t like her, and my mom likes everyone.",18Feb2019,1

After dropping out I felt a great sense of relief, I’ve been working full time since then trying to afford a new car (one of the reasons I was so stressed) but now I’m just feeling very down about my decision, although I cannot wait to get back on my feet and re enroll back into school, some people are being very discouraging, I agree because I feel like I let them and myself down, but i do fully intend on going back and getting my degree. I guess what I’m looking for is some words of advice, stories, or someone with a similar situation? I feel the real I’m taking to work on my mental health is well worth it because it’s giving me time to reflect on what I really want and giving me the confidence to go back and get it done when I’m ready.

Sometimes I don't like it, for example after watching the Dwayne Johnson Hercules, I felt primal and brutish like the character. Sometimes I do like it when the main character is one I like.

This had honestly made me become very down and stressed and I know something isn't right with me but I don't know what. I constantly feel like I don't belong here at all or fit in with anyone and therefore cut myself off from anyone I haven't made friends with yet, and I rarely even telly family or fiance how I feel because before I send that text or say something my mind just stops me and I get to nervous to do it.

144,"I’m 33, female, single, and never been married. No kids. No house. No 4 year college degree. Most of the time I accept that my path is different. But some days it’s really hard to accept. You see your peers experiencing all of the major milestones in life one is “supposed” to have in this society. I can’t even have a normal day or a normal relationship. I have depression, anxiety, ADHD, and borderline personality disorder. I find success and happiness in little things each day in my own way. But I think it’s hard that the majority of this society gets to celebrate events together, like marriage and kids. And I’m out here on the outside wanting to connect to this society but it’s hard feeling so alone out here. Who do I celebrate with? Who can I tell my little victories to each day? (which sometimes is just staying awake.) Lonelier still, is my own lack of self acceptance in that I am truly a person with mental illness. All my life I’ve tried so hard to appear normal. I’ve desperately tried to be like everyone else. This constant rejection of my true self leaves me feeling very sad and alone. But to truly accept my path and that my brain is different, my journey is different, my place in this world is different... How do I do it? I know a perspective shift is needed. But it’s so hard.

For a while, I've been dealing with mild anxiety. I would say I started realizing it in November but I ignored it. I have a lot of stress in my life, mainly financial and academic stress. I'm also a perfectionist in the sense that if I don't give something my 100%, or if it's not perfect, it's a failure. I also have a hard time believing in myself and my abilities, and I know that if I at least believed in myself, I would achieve a lot more than I do.

Today, I took a subject test for an online tutoring job I'm applying to. I didn't pass the test but I have the option for a retake. I was trying to process it, when I realized I have so much to do and get done by the end of the week. At that point I had an anxiety attack, with shortness of breath and trembling. I managed to take deep breaths to calm myself down and not long after I broke down crying. Crying because of all the stress I'm going through, the fact that I didn't pass...I'm actually so desperate for a job now. I rely on my parents for money and I want to stop and have some financial independence. I'm in college and take a full course load so I don't have much time to balance an actual job with my academic schedule so it's ideal I do something online. Besides I am abroad for the semester so my visa does not allow me to work.

I've been meaning to talk to a therapist for a while but the cost is what has stopped me, however the one at my college is only available on Wednesday mornings and I have my internship then, so I really can't go. I can't go to any other therapists because I have no money and I am currently not registered with health insurance at the country I'm in.

150,"Hello there, and sorry for the vague title. A childhood friend of mine recently told me that he has been struggling with depression and anxiety for the last 3 years. I have had my suspicions about this, mainly because he suffers from a rare type of migraine that impacts his life quite heavily. He will have migraine 9 out of 10 days, and the period may last 8+ hours.  

The reason I am reaching out is that he told me he wanted to talk about his issues to me, so that it was not only family and shrinks. I want to be supportive, understand him if that is possible, at the bare minimum, not make matters worse. I hope you can offer me insight into how to deal with this the best way.  

To give you some more backstory. I think that he feels that he is missing out on a lot of things in life. He is not done with high school, his younger sister who is 4 years younger than him finished last year. We have friends who moved to other cities and countries. While this is happening, he is standing still. He just now exhausted our hospital of all the different options they had for treating him, so now he has to be transferred to a new hospital. He is also now hospitalised because of his mental health, mainly because of panic attacks.

152,"I will try to keep this as short as possible. Been with this guy almost two years. Recently went on a break because I felt like maybe being in a relationship was putting to much stress on him. He was fine when I met him, charming, bit shy, liked to make music, good to talk to, very smart about 8 months in (Nov 17) first flashes of paranoia, feel like this was made worse by a bad trip on truffles in Amsterdam (Jan 18) and by (Apr 18) he was admitted to psychiatric ward. Came out after 2 months, didn't want his medication, continued smoking weed, lost all his friends due to multiple outbursts. Went back in (Aug 18) came out and pretty much the same story again regarding medication and overusing weed. I stopped living with him Sept 2018 cos I just felt like he needed space also he would become irritated with me and kick me out of the house when he was in a mood. But now he just seems to be more depressed, whereas before he was psychotic, aggressive or paranoid. He just seems sad and totally checked out, barely talks and just cries sometimes. I can usually cheer him up if I hang around long enough and chat with him. But it's always temporary. And because I work full time and am also in uni full time I can't be there for him 24/7. I tried every thing and approach I could when we did live together, and nothing has worked and it's breaking my heart. I now it's not about me but he is such a great guy and it's a shame to see him just give up on himself and be so trapped in his own mind. Felt like us being on a break would make him more self sufficient but now he is going into hospital again (Feb 19). I feel hopeless and helpless. I literally am at my wits end. I know there's no magic cure but feel like it's just a cycle of hospital stays, and nothing changes. I don't want to give up on him at all. I'd do anything to support him. But I just really don't know what to do for him anymore? Any help is appreciated.

153,"I love and hate my father at the same time. I love him because he is my father. I hate him because he ruined me. He is the reason I have depression. He traumatized me. He is/was violent and aggressive. He doesn't respect my privacy. He shouts at me. He does the same thing to my mother and my siblings. He hurt me so much in the past, but I don't want to go into detail right now.

I never had a real friendship, I was bullied by my classmates *and* my teachers, the children in the neighborhood used to beat me up too, I had two relationships so far, one guy was a psychopath and the other admitted that he never loved me so everything was not real. I have no friends to talk to about this, so I'm posting it here..

I have been diagnosed with social anxiety, moderate depression and PTSD. I have been in therapy for a few months and I've been on 10 mg fluoxetine for like a month.

I just ""finished"" my third semester (I study physics), well not really because I failed two out of three exams. I *think* I passed the third exam, I don't have the results yet. One exam I already failed twice and we only have three chances to pass each exam. If I fail three times, I get kicked out of university and will never be able to study physics ever again. I only have one chance left.

So I wake up today, planning to study for my third try and my mom told me my dad has cancer during breakfast. He has been in the hospital since friday and a tumor has apparently been removed. I knew he was in the hospital and that he had a surgery but I didn't know it was because of cancer. We are visiting him tomorrow. I have an older sister and a younger brother. My sister knows about all this but I don't know about my brother.

I also want to add that my dad is not *always* horrible. Sometimes he is nice and loving. But whenever that is the case I feel very uneasy since I don't know if I should take it seriously. Whenever he is nice to me I can't help but think of the times where he beat me up. Apparently he has been doing chemotherapy for a while and I also noticed that he was doing better (mood wise) than before and my mom told me he is not as aggressive anymore because it's working. It's getting better.

Anyway, this post probably doesn't make a lot of sense but it's almost midnight.. What I'm trying to say is.. I don't know how to feel. I kinda feel rage, like I wanna break something. I don't know what to feel, I don't know if I should be sad. The whole time I'm thinking about all the things he has done to me. And now to hear that he has cancer.. it is scary. I can't concentrate. And I have one try left to pass this stupid exam. I can't deal with this. I have never lost someone. I have never dealt with someone I know suffering from cancer. This is so new to me. I don't know if I'm a bad person if I'm not sad. He traumatized me. He traumatized all of us. But he is my father. I am so conflicted, so confused, I don't know what to feel.

I've been better lately, no more painful and petrifying flashbacks or sudden moments of stopping and saying ""what's the point in it all"".

But what hasn't gone away is these brief moments of my brain just feeling as if I'm strapped to the front of a speeding train.

To the point where I’ve thought (had no intention but thought) of killing myself and my pets so they don’t suffer without me. And letting the people who’ve hurt me live with that until they too die. 

I’m not suicidal? But I just get so overwhelmed, that idea doesn’t seem so bad but I would never do it. 

Basically: I live with my parents and sister at home (I’m in my 20’s and female - I have no job currently, and I’m drowning in debt -will explain-). My mom is addicted to sleeping pills and constantly abuses them at random times. If I have the opportunity to leave for out of town anywhere from a few days to a week (which I do about once a month but am now stopping because of this reason I’m about to say) - 50/50 my mom will be high when I get back.

On top of that, my dog is dying and I’ve spent thousands at vets to ease his pain, get help, and so on... many people could say just to euthanize him, or ‘get over it’ but to me he’s not just a dog. Hes so much more to me than a pet. I grew up with domestic violence and my dog was always there for me to re direct my attention from being the ‘scared helpless child watching her parents beat each other with a phone in my hand to call 911 if things escalated’ to ‘a responsible, caring dog owner. Someone who could be useful / helpful instead of helpless and a victim. Someone who was important instead of forgotten in the crevice of domestic violence in a home.’ When I was a teen battling depression and contemplated suicide, I stopped myself because I knew if I was gone no one could take care of my dog the way I did.

And now, 17+ years later, he’s still here but often gets sick and needs medical care. That’s where most of my debt has come from. I don’t want to get a job because I want to be home for my pets. I feel like a leech and like imwasting my life away. The crazy part is, I had ambitions and goals for so many things and now it’s falling through my hands like running water. 

So.. if my mom is high on pills and/ or my dog gets sick, I just get beyond stressed to the point I lose all hope or value in living but I do it anyway for my sister and pets. Because to me, they’re not just my ‘pets’ or ‘sister’ they’re my reminder that I’m useful, that they depend on me, that I’m not useless to them. 

I just want to be normal.. but I don’t know what more I can do. Every time something (one or both of the above mentioned) happens, I feel like I lose a bit of myself every time. I always snap out of it once things go back to normal but I don’t know how many more times I have to break for me to go crazy completely...

Should I seek therapy or counseling? I’m in my 20’s and a female. I don’t know what else I can do anymore because ‘dealing with it and handling it’ is just slowly making things worse",18Feb2019,2

I live with my girlfriend of 1.5 years. I have a very good grasp on her mental health, how to help her specifically, and what my limitations are.

One of my limitations is her history with food. She was never bulimic or anorexic, but she has a bad relationship with food. Was once an enemy, and she often refused to eat very much. She's a lot better now, and often the relationship swings the other way, where she overeats on sweets.

We just returned from a trip back home. She is refusing to eat anything in our apartment because none of it is as good as what he mom makes (she has a fantastic relationship with her mom and misses her dearly all the time). I know that this is temporary, and she will be eating normally soon.

My question is this: what is the danger zone when it comes to food? Is it okay to let her go a day without food? I've been operating under the impression that I should always be getting at least something in her stomach so that she isn't starving herself, but it's a tough battle. Sometimes it doesn't work.

So knowing that, and considering patterns of people who have bad relationships with food, are there best practices here? It's way out of my element, as someone who will literally eat anything to get food in my stomach and never have to face any consequences.",18Feb2019,1

&gt;**Most destructive behavior is the result of emotional baggage that’s been stuffed; you may not even be aware that you’ve suppressed a chunk of your feelings that don’t settle into the feel-good pile.** 

People react in all sorts of ways when confronted with difficult emotions. Some overeat; others drink too much, and still, others may pop pills or have complicated sex lives. Maybe you’re someone who hops from relationship to relationship when the real issue is not that you’re a relationship junkie, but that you’ll do just about anything to keep yourself from feeling your feelings. You seek out diversions with the same tenacity that moss clings to the north side of a rock. Let’s be honest—there’s no better high than a new romance, but the high only lasts for a short time and then it’s on to someone or something else. People behave in all sorts of ways to avoid feeling anything other than good—regardless if it’s artificially induced or not.

#### Here are my top 3 picks of emotions that people have a hard time managing with grace:

#### 1.) Betrayal2.) Anger/Resentment3.) Fear

With most of them, it all comes down to accepting that we can’t control other people places and things. It also helps to remember that hurt people, hurt others.

**Betrayal:**

One of the most difficult and least discussed emotion is betrayal. Betrayal is a punch in the gut because it can’t happen until we decide to trust someone. It’s heart-wrenching when someone you thought you could believe in seeks to honor their own selfish desires ahead of the relationship. It can be a family member, a lover, a friend, but the feeling of disbelief and angst is all the same. Betrayal is about dishonesty. In almost all cases, the person who betrays you is a liar, and often a thief. They may leave you feeling shocked, worthless, or grieving the loss of who you thought they were while struggling to accept the reality of who they are (reality can be ugly). It’s quite difficult to reconcile the fact that the person we thought we knew and loved is not at all the person we knew and loved, but instead, they’re someone who is capable of ruthless selfishness and that they are self-serving to the nth degree.

**Anger/Resentment:**

People practice any number of vices when they are angry or caught up in resentment. For those in recovery, we know that we cannot live with these poison emotions—but many people who don’t have addiction issues still struggle to find their way out of anger and resentment—and to move past these troubling emotions without sinking into depression, anxiety, food, or sex comas—as many so often do.

Being an adult is learning how to deal with these taxing emotions in a healthy way. To stay angry at the boss who passed you over for that promotion will only hurt you in the long-run. We have choices: we can stay stuck in the problem or find a way to move on. If that means finding another job, so be it, but we have to be willing to take whatever action we need to take in order to ax toxic people from our lives.

Another example may fall in the arena of parenting: A parent may feel angry or resentful toward a wayward or difficult child who usurps more than their fair share of time and energy. Then, to have to deal with the guilt you feel for feeling angry and resentful toward your child that you’re supposed to love unconditionally. Hey, we’re human. It’s okay to have these sorts of feelings; it’s what we do with these feelings that matter, and what matters is to feel the feeling and then start to look for solutions.  It’s okay to take it easy on ourselves and ease up on the expectations that we “shouldn’t” feel a certain way. People have a way of deciding in advance how they think they should feel or react, and when the reaction is different than expected, they judge themselves. We need to let go of the “should” and act out of a place of love not only for ourselves but for the other person.

### Strong emotions can be scary to confront so it’s easier to ignore them, stuff them, or, eat, screw, &amp; drink at them. I’ll show you—I’ll hurt me.

**Fear**

People are riddled with fear: fear of not getting what they want, fear of the future, fear of losing something they have—how can anyone live in that state of dis-ease, and not reach for a vice to quell the committee screaming in their heads? Fear can be crippling for many, so they turn to self-medicating to ease the discomfort.

Emotions drive behavior. When I look around it seems that people operate from two different emotional phases: the *reward* phase of the *numb* phase. It’s hard to find people who can actually feel and deal without the need for adjuncts. Emotional maturity doesn’t just happen—coping skills have to be taught, and if we don’t already possess them—we can be willing to learn. After all, life is too short to live our days in angst, but in order to get a different outcome and to have better relationships in our lives—we have to change. We can learn to set healthy boundaries; we can search for constructive ways to relieve the inner pain, and we can heal.

#### There is no one so deserving of your time that they get to live rent-free in your head!

it feels like my mind is in one realm and my actually body is in another.
