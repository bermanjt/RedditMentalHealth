1,"Hi ya'll I'm from Illinois. Some background -I'm really new to getting my own insurance and dont want to screw it up again. I lost insurance because I quit my job that had insurance because I had an anxiety attack and couldn't function at work. This was around February. I did get some therapy and some prescriptions setup even though I didnt feel like it all helped too much, bit it did make a dent

I got the cheapest healthcare I could get and that basically covered my medicine but nothing in terms of medical visits so I canceled it and couldn't get insurance until this next year. 

Now I really need to see a psychiatrist and try to get my life together, I have anxiety and major depression and some other problems but those aren't as pressing. I'm really afraid that I'm going to make the wrong choice again and be stuck with insurance that I won't be able to get help I need so I'm trying to find out which would better suit my needs or if it even matters at all?",23Nov2019,1

3,"I constantly find myself in situations that seem hopeless. I grow more tired of being an outsider every single day. I just wish I had someone in my life. Friends, a romantic relationship. My tears are running down my cheeks as I write this. I just can't stop thinking. I'm almost 24. When is it my turn to shine a little? When will I be in a relationship? When will I have a friend to spend time with? Though being a loner is what I know, I still watch, observe, and long for what other people have. Things that seem normal to most, but that is nothing but a dream for someone like me.


I constantly hear and read about things that only seem to make me feel more isolated. More abnormal. You can't really tell me to avoid those things, because they are literally everywhere. Whenever I watch TV, whenever I use the internet, whenever I read a book, whenever I open the door and walk outside, and whenever I talk to someone, whether in person or online. It slowly crushes me. 

I don't know how much of this I can take.",23Nov2019,1

6,"I do not feel comfortable going into this much detail about my life in public but I have this need to share it with everyone in hopes that it can help anyone step back a few steps and to realize if they are on the brink of collapse, I do not think anyone deserves to feel the way I have felt the previous few months. Things are getting better for me and I feel I am finally gaining control over my thoughts and feelings. I am now a true advocate for the mental health group and want to spread the awareness for everyone in the workplace because this is a thing people should never ignore.


Before my life began to spin out of control I was your normal guy. I worked in sales and worked long hours. I have a beautiful family which is my wife, two beautiful daughters and 2 cats. We rent a two story beautiful townhouse. I worked very hard to give my family a very decent life, my wife was a stay at home mom and watched over our girls which are age 2 and age 9. I made right around $95,000 a year so I was pretty proud of myself for being able to supply for my family plus more. 

It’s around the end of March on a Friday and I’m just at the store and it’s roughly an hour before closing the place down for the night. My father shoots me a text saying that he’s going to a new casino that opened up close by and asked if I wanted to go. I honestly didn’t know one opened and I did not really have anything else planned so I went. I took maybe $200 to play with, had a good time and lost the $200 then left.

A few days have passed and we are now in the first week of June. I for some reason had this urge to back and play again and bring maybe $200. The first machine I sat down at, the second spin I won the jackpot which was $26,500. At this moment I really do think this was the starting point of my downfall. At the current time I feel like I hit it big, I was going to pay down most of my debt and life would be so much better. I took the money and ran, paid off some debt and went on with my life. 

A week or so goes by and I decide to go back to the same casino alone this time and to blow off a few hours, long story short I hit another jackpot for $33,500.00. My mind was blown, and for some reason the rest of my story it a extreme fog but I will tell it the best I can. 

I was so happy, I kept telling myself everything would change now. I will be home more for the kids and wife, debts going away, life is going to be awesome. To be honest with you all, I think at this point I was now hooked into the addiction of gambling. I did not see it at the time, but this is the point where it hooked me and it was nothing but downhill from here. I gambled away about $10,000 of my winnings and long and behold, I ended up hitting another jackpot 2 days later for $36,000.00. I now have begun to tell myself that I knew the system, I know how to beat it. Im going to win another jackpot because I knew the secret. In 11 days I had hit 3 jackpots for a total of $96,000.00. This seriously fucked with my head, like seriously. I wish I have never won any of the jackpots, this is what lured me into the demise of my life. 

About two weeks into all my winnings, I gambled it all away. 

Before going further into my story, I want to explain to everyone that yes I was at this point addicted to gambling, but I was never a theif or did anything to hurt my family until after somthing just triggered in my head shortly after winning the jackpot.

Well, after losing all of the winnings, I kept telling myself I knew the secret to win another jackpot. I began to embezzle money from work thinking it was perfectly ok, which it was actually stealing. But for some reason at the time, I honestly thought it was ok which is very scary, that is not right.

I ended up stealing close to $35,000.00 from work before realizing one saturday night that I stole $35,000.00. It hit me like a truck. What have I done? Why did I do this to myself and my family? I couldn't answer my own questions as I argue in my head back and forth on what I did was wrong and why on earth did this happen.

They very next day I went into my office and confessed what I have done, paid it back in full from my 401k. Then went down to the police station to turn myself in. Thankfully they took it very easy on me sense I was able to pay it back in full and do not have a criminal record. I was required to go see a therapist and a doctor which I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and I apparently was going through a Manic episode which was triggered during all of this. 

I lost my house, family, money, everything from a addiction and a disorder I had which could have been prevented I was told if I had a better work life balance and took care of my mental health before hand.

So, Im sitting here writing this now for everyone to know. Please take care of your mental health, take time off and spend it with your family. The extra time at work IS NOT worth it. Look after yourself and the family before work. I feel like my problem could have been avoided if I took care of myself over working the extra hours. 

Overall yes I developed an addiction to gambling. But, something other then my addiction drove me to steal and told me it was ok to do so, which is not me. I made a mistake and now I am fighting to fix my life, please dont let your mental health slip away. Because, if you do you wont even know what you did until the damage is already done.

Feel free to ask me questions, I will not be able to answer them until in the morning because I am currently serving a two month sentence with work release. So I can see them during the day, just not at night.

Also, I just want to say it again. Please do not ignore any signs with your mental health. If you are catching yourself doing things that are wrong and you are telling yourself its ok to do them. Seek help before you do something your not able to recover from. Please, its ok to ask for help. This goes to anyone who has suffered or is suffering from a mental health issue.",23Nov2019,1
7,"Im kinda young adult here but as I've grown older I'm more able to  better control my emotions  and thought process. I just know sometimes I do lose my shit and when it happens I'm not myself normally for two or three days. Doesn't happen as often as before maybe every month or two. When you just lose it due to anxiety,insecurity, and etc how do you get back to yourself. 

Only way I've been able to cope is I just treat every thought the same and don't give any of my thoughts any value. kinda of like a wave it happens no matter what and it eventually will come again and go away.  I'm just curious ant methods you use",23Nov2019,1
8,"**TLDR: My new therapist** [**kept doing this.**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TChRv8m79zs) 

I had my last therapist for 3 years. She was amazing, and has been such a huge, impactful part of my life, especially my formative years and my transition into my 20s. I felt like she really cared about me and my wellbeing, and I'm pretty sure this isn't just me projecting that onto her because I have mommy issues. She always checked on every part of my life, not just my feelings, but also making sure that I'm eating enough, spending my money right, etc. When I came to her, I was a terrified, poor, borderline homeless 19-year-old in an emotionally abusive relationship.

While my relationship has gotten better, there are still tons of issues and I'm reaching my breaking point. I got a new job that will likely be the thing that pulls me out of poverty, as I graduated a year-long programming bootcamp. Just when it feels like my life is turning around for the better, I'm told that she works at a new practice now. I've called her, texted her, emailed her... nothing. She never told me. She never said goodbye. And it seems like she has no interest to do so, and I don't know why. The last few times I saw her, I'd just told her that I got my job, and she was telling me how proud she was of me for making it this far, keeping it together, changing my life, etc.

Well, I get pro-bono therapy from this awesome practice. I called them up and asked for a new therapist, since my old one no longer works there. I chatted with the woman who'd be my new therapist, and we decided that we'd have phone sessions a bit. I thought it a little odd and different, but I work from home at my new job every Friday, and that was her availability (Fridays) so I figured it'd all work out anyway.

Had the first session today. 

I don't like her.

And I don't even think a lot of that is, ""She's not my old therapist, so I don't like her"". I've had SEVERAL therapists throughout my life (though my last one was the longest bout of treatment I'd ever had by a longshot); I've probably had 3 good ones, and 3 or 4 bad ones(One when I was a very small child, one when I was in middle school, and and 4 in my adult years), so I'd like to think that I have some idea of how these new sessions work: One or two sessions are devoted to hearing about my background, and then we begin tackling some of my problems once they have a good idea of what they are.

This lady KEPT. CUTTING. ME. OFF. Like, aggressively active-listening. First off, the direction of the first session was *weird.* She didn't ask me about myself, or attempt to get to know me at all. She straight of began talking to me like she'd already been my therapist for some time. Went straight into, ""So what is it that you and Lauryn were working on before?"" I thought it was weird, so I told her I'd gotten a new job, and she thought we'd cut straight to, ""Well, are you using the strategies you and Lauryn talked about?"" She told me Lauryn had notes on me, and that she'd scanned through those already, so I asked if she'd outlined what those strategies were, and she told me ""No"". Sooo that means we were talking about ""The strategies my therapist used with me"" without asking what those were. I was like ""Well, work is good and everything, but -- "" **and she cut me off, and almost began to insinuate that it sounded like I didn't need therapy.**

I had to cut her off and tell her that my therapist actually warned me that I would need therapy badly in the next coming months, because for the first time in my life, I'm becoming financially stable after a life of poverty, and 3 years of homelessness. She said I wouldn't know how to cope with not having to feel like I'm running from something all the time. She was right. I'm doing a lot and have a lot of irons in the fire, and feel more fulfilled lately, but I'm experiencing a new kind of stress right now, and I'm absolutely struggling to transition, *ON TOP OF THE FACT* that my therapist, who knows I have abandonment issues, up and left without any notification. I had to cut her off and tell her that no, actually, I am struggling with a few things. I asked if she was sure she didn't want to start by me just recapping on my life really quick -- you know, giving this lady some context before she goes and tells me what she thinks I need after talking to her for 15 minutes -- and she told me ""no"".

She continued to spit generic statements about things that I ""need to understand"" about people and life without asking what my experiences were -- things that, if she actually listened to me more than she spoke during the session, she'd get an idea of what exactly my therapist and I talked about for 3 years, and that they were things we already covered. It almost sounded like she was following a formula of, ""Patient inputs sentence, I output sage, unrelated, therapy-ish sounding advice"", and I barely got to tell her anything. She would make assumptions about my life and relationship without hearing any actual context. I told her my mom was a narcissist, and she was like, ""Yeah, I married a narcissist, so I know exactly what you're feeling."" **I didn't like that.** You don't tell someone who just lost a family member that you ""Know exactly how that feels"" because you lost a friend or family member. You don't. Everyone's grief is different. It felt dismissive. Like I feel like she should have listened to what I had to say about how I was feeling, but she was quick to say that she already knew that. Every time I began talking about my life, she'd cut me off and try to finish my sentence. It was fucking difficult to stay polite and not tell her to please be quiet so she can do her job and actually learn a single thing about my life. To make matters worse, the way she was finishing my sentences wasn't even close to what I was going to say.

When my boyfriend came home, I told him what happened, and he tentatively suggested I tell her how the way that I was talking to her made me feel. I told him that I felt like I shouldn't have to confront my therapist on her behavior in only session 2. He changed his view after that, and said that that sounded like too stressful of a thing for me to have to do with someone I Just met.

I'm giving one more session a try the Friday after this Thanksgiving holiday, and if she keeps this up, then I'm going to request a new one. She's honestly made a period of feeling loss over my therapist worse. I feel like I'm in this all alone, and talking to her actually made me more alone. I feel like I shouldn't have to verbally fight someone or talk over them to get my feelings out.",23Nov2019,1
9,"I personally suffer from depression (either Dysthymia or Major Depressive Disorder, doctors aren't sure), Borderline Personality Disorder, Anxiety and Complex-Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I was diagnosed only with depression and anxiety around 7 years ago, I spent 2 years consistently going to therapy, and was discharged. Then I got into a new school, a new relationship, and ended up relapsing after experiencing close to 1.5 years of emotional abuse. I started getting medicated for it since then, on and off with different types, variations, and combinations, but I never got better. In fact, I only kept getting worse these past 4 years. 

I started off being able to do well in university, despite the constant fatigue, and low mood. Then I felt like things were getting better the second semester, and felt like I was peaking in the third semester, and that things were only going to get better. Then during my fourth semester, I crashed around a month into the semester, getting hospitalized 3 times within the span of a month. My school forced me to drop all but 1 credits worth of class (Out of the average course load of 15 credits). Nothing huge in my life had changed. I was dating a boy that I loved with all my heart starting from semester 2. The biggest change between Sem 3, and Sem 4 was that I was embarking on a university funded project to provide dialogue and a platform for discussions about diversity via chalk murals. 

Thinking in retrospect, I was mostly sad and depressed when I felt alone or lonely, or when my friends/SO show signs of disinterest in me. Throughout these 4 Semesters, I was struggling with eating healthily, working out regularly, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts, I had not made any attempts up until Sem 4. That's when I started making active attempts to try and kill myself. After getting out of the hospital the third time, I was told that I had little to no options left, I'm not sure if I got the message right, but it sounded like they wouldn't take me back to the hospital anymore, they had kicked me out of their Day Program, and I was never allowed back. (Possibly due to the suicide attempt made after my first week in the program) I eventually tried to seek help locally by getting a local psychiatrist not affiliated with the school (as they weren't very helpful), but all of them turned me down, stating that my case was too acute. 

I tried going back to school after the winter break, however I found myself struggling again emotionally 2 months in. I spent the next month in a residential facility in a different state, trying to get better, but I ended up fucking it all up. I smuggled illicit substances into the place, then confessed to it, even though there was no need to (the staff were oblivious). I still had huge suicidal tendencies which led to my hospitalization during this time. When I was about to be discharged from the hospital back to the residential facility, there were so many communication errors, that I ended up having to live at my aunt's for a night. I started to lose faith in the facility, and I decided against the doctors' wishes to leave the place. I went back to the state where I studied, and met with my boyfriend who I later found to have given me STDs, which meant he had cheated on me. I broke up with him of course, but I would not be over him for the next 6 months.

I went back to my home country and sought help from local psychologists and psychiatrists. I saw them for about 4 months, and they agreed that I was ready to go back to school. I had applied for a transfer to a different school in a different state, so that I could find local doctors to deal with my mental health issues. I lasted for about a month, before I had yet another breakdown. This time I had no real trigger, I was just generally mentally ill still grieving the loss of my previous relationship, and attempting to numb it with a new one, all on top of schoolwork (which I was a perfectionist about). The new school asked me to take a reduced course load (3 credits out of 15) and I started feeling defeated. I hadn't completed a normal semester 3 times in a row now. Around this time, I attended and successfully completed a day program for mental health. 

So I finished up the semester, and went back to my home country, seeking help from my doctors again, they found me unfit for my studies right before the next semester started, and I was devastated. My progress seemed like it was non-existent. I then decided that I needed to move countries instead. 

So I applied to different universities outside of the U.S.A so that when I get better, I could go back to school somewhere. So mid- 2019, I got accepted into a university in Australia, and I seemed in an okay headspace, so the doctors signed me off, and I went to study here. I began the semester immediately seeking help even though I was fine, preemptively trying to get a hold on this illness. It was about a month in when another suicidal episode flared up, I felt all alone again, and I was worried about my studies. I tried seeking help, but the Emergency Department only observed me, and offered no solid advice, I went to see the doctor, and he said I wasn't trying hard enough to kill myself. I felt hopeless, like there was nothing I could do here to help myself. After this suicidal episode, two more followed caused by interpersonal relationship problems. I started realizing that the friends I was making was excluding me from a lot of activities, and somehow didn't want me to be part of the apartment group chat. While the third episode was dying down, I made some more new friends, meeting my most recent boyfriend in the process. 

Things seemed to get better with these newfound relationships in my life. Then I switched my medication, and started having increased suicidal ideations. They were so severe I ended up following through with one very plausible plan to end my life. I of course survived, but the relationships as a result had suffered. Which meant that I was once again thrown back into a suicidal episode, this time because of all the lost relationships. My now ex-boyfriend will not talk to me at all, and our friend group is awkward, and weird now because of this strain in the relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

Looking back at my fight with these mental illnesses, I'm starting to wonder if:

1. This is a motivational problem, I have no motivation of getting better.
2. Feeling horrible has become 'normal' for me, it's uncomfortable to think about or actually be healthy.
3. If I have any motivation of getting better, it's extrinsic, which is not sustainable. I need others to know I'm better, otherwise, it's not worth it.
4. I feel like I'm unworthy of getting better?

&amp;#x200B;

I am lost, and unsure of what to do now. I feel like the past 10 years of my life have been wasted by the mental illness, and attempting to get better at dealing with it (sometimes more successfully than others). I don't know if I will ever get better. Is there something I am doing wrong? What could I do to actually get better sustainably?",23Nov2019,1

He had remembered that I liked going for drives to clear my mind and remembered how I had told him about my friends that had been sent to jail and he asked how they were doing.

I lost my insurance a couple months ago and I’m currently trying to find a therapist that will take me. My old one won’t be able to because my new insurance isn’t covered.

It’s not my first rodeo with anxiety or depression. My therapist told me my depression is actually anxiety driven. Towards the end of October I started feeling my anxiety flare up. My ears feel like I’m in high altitude and they need to pop. My neck and legs are sore from the stiffness. I don’t have energy to get out of bed. But for the first time ever, I’ve been experiencing this horrible mental fog. I’ve done this job for over 3 years. I’m a supervisor for fuck’s sake. I feel so easily overwhelmed by tasks I’m used to doing every single day. Almost like a new hire on day one. Work doesn’t even have to be overwhelming. Also my sex drive is decreased or non existent. I feel like I’m not even myself because of how much I’ve changed since the start of the month.

I saw three doctors in an attempt to obtain a necessary referral. All therapists that are covered by my insurance are either not taking new patients or don’t have appointments until January. Because of this, 2 of the doctors want to put me on Paxil 20 mg and the last one told me to get on Prozac 10 mg, at least to get me through until January. I just want to feel like me again, and having to be on a medication to get there only makes me feel less like me

I’m sorry for the ramblings, I just want any advice or heads up. Should I take the medication? And if so which one? I understand both are relatively low doses but I’m still scared because I’ve read of the side effects and withdrawals. Any perspective is appreciated.",23Nov2019,1
16,"\*Trigger Warning:\* &gt;!Suicide!&lt;

Hi. This will be ~~kind of~~ really long, so I'm sorry.

For the past two years, I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts. They come on almost a daily basis, and a lot of times, they're all I can think about. I'm a sophomore in high school, and I've always struggled with low self-esteem and confidence for as long as I can remember. I overthink almost everything, and my mind always turns everything negative, or tries to see the bad in everything. I feel like I'm only living to survive.

I wish I could change how negative I am, but I don't know how to. I've tried being positive, but that hasn't worked for me. It just feels like I'm trying to fake my sadness and avoid how I feel, which doesn't really help. I don't want my negativity to be a part of who I am; I want to separate myself from it, but it's always there. Even if I'm happy and having fun with my friends, it still stays in the back of my mind, like a disease I can't get rid of. 

As for the causes of this, I think it's been a mix of factors.

My family hasn't always been the most stable at home. My parents have argued a lot since before I was born, but they're still together. It's usually verbal abuse from my dad to my mom. I was hit a lot as a kid too, but I know that it's normal in Asian (or really, any first-gen) culture. Plus, the physical abuse doesn't affect me much now (it made me cry A LOT as a kid).

We also aren't the best financially. To be honest, I can't help but feel jealous and frustrated when I see other kids with their new phones and computers, while I have my old, hand-me-down phone and a slow computer.

I'm rank 1 in my grade at school (not saying this to show off), and I feel like that's all people see me as. Just someone smart, nothing more; someone who doesn't struggle. But I get suicidal thoughts at school a lot too. I get jealous that even though I work hard at school, I don't have as many things as the other kids who don't care about their education do (even though I know I don't know about everyone's situation, I can tell who's actually lazy). I wish I could be talented at something else, but my parents expect me to do well and focus on school, and I don't have much time or motivation to pursue other things. Most things don't interest me either, except for things like psychology and art, which I practice often. I don't have a good idea of what I want to do in college too, or in the future in general. I just think that if I'm eventually going to end all of this, then what's the point of thinking about what lies ahead for me? 

To cope, sometimes I isolate myself. A common habit of mine is overeating, or binge-eating sweet things to fill the void. I've been trying to stop those though, since I'm gaining weight in this unhealthy way, which makes me feel insecure.

I think one of the moments that hurts the most for me was when I was inappropriately touched in 6th grade by 2 boys in my class, and it always makes me feel bad to think about. One of the boys who did it was the biggest bully in our grade, and everyone was intimidated by him; myself included. I never told anyone, because it made me (and still makes me) feel ashamed and gross about myself.

I really wish I could stop living, but I know it would devastate my family. Sometimes I think that maybe it's better in the long run, since I feel like a financial burden on my family, as well as a factor of their stress. But even my negativity can't convince me it won't destroy them. I haven't been the best person I can be, either. I don't always listen to my parents when they try to restrict me or tell me to do things, because I just don't have the energy to. I know that my mental health isn't an excuse for how I act, so I try to be a good person whenever I can.

And to be honest, doing good helps. It feels like it's my purpose or my duty to help others, even if my mind tells me day after day that I should die. It makes me feel a little bit better to know that I can be helpful sometimes instead of a burden.

Love is the main reason I've chosen to stay alive so far. Not just romantic love, but the love I have for my friends and family, and the love that they give me. I've told my closest friends about my suicidal thoughts, and they're here for me whenever I need it. I really appreciate their support, but to be honest, their advice doesn't really help my situation (I don't blame them for not knowing how to help), so I came here instead. Their friendship and how much they care about me helps me so much though. I'm just worried that this darkness in my heart will win the battle eventually.

As for my love life, I've been hurt by love twice before (I've been in two relationships that didn't end well). I'm scared to love again, since I feel like my negativity will stop me from being lovable to anyone. I've had a crush on my good friend for 5 months now (he doesn't know about my suicidal thoughts), but I don't have the courage to confess to him. I'm not sure if I'm ready (or ever will be ready) for a relationship either. And I'm scared that I'm not attractive enough too (In my opinion, I'm really ugly, but my friends say I look good, including him). But he's definitely my type. He's caring, kind, funny, and wholesome and sweet. We share a lot of interests, and we play video games together too. Getting to spend time with him and my friends makes me really happy.

I've also done some research, looking into this, and I think I might have depression. But my traditional Asian family looks down on mental illnesses (they think the people who have them are crazy), so I can't get therapy or medication until I turn 18, or maybe even later if I can't get a job to pay for them by then (which could go all the way to 6+ more years, after I finish college). I can't tell my doctor or school counselor either because I think they'll tell my parents, and I'm worried that they'll look down on me if they know.  I just don't know if I can make it that long, since these 2 years have been killing me already.

Well, I guess that's the end of it. Thank you all so much for reading. I appreciate each and every single one of you for giving me your time. &lt;3 I would also appreciate any advice or words of encouragement and hope you could give me, because I really need it. 

Thank you again, everyone!!",23Nov2019,1

18,"So, every time when I hear a relatively noisy and constant noise of a fan or hum, my brain goes into a frenzy. I just keep hearing these voices of people aggressively shouting and arguing with each other. Nothing in particular. All of my normal thoughts just become argumentative and violent. For example, I was just playing some of this new Star Wars game. The PS4 is chugging along, trying to keep up with the demand of the game, so the fan starts to blow really hard and doesn’t let up. All of a sudden, every thought in my mind just gets aggressive and are shouting in my head instead of calm thoughts. Instead of “I need to go to the Weathered Ruins to find this Echo.”, it’s “I NEED TO GOOO TO THE FUCKING WEATHERED RUINS TO FIND THIS ECHOOOOOO!!!!”. It’s the best way I can describe it.

Any ideas? I think I might be crazy...",23Nov2019,1

22,"I somehow was diagnosed with three different depressive disorders. Idk how that's possible but I feel that's accurate. They've been kicking my ass lately. I was having a small discussion with my mom and I didn't want to come down the steps (talking to her from the stairs). I wanted to work on a service dog application I had finally been able to download. She has to go and make a comment like ""Oh your bed misses you?"" REALLY. REALLY!? She's such a hypocrite. She was also diagnosed with MDD (which I don't believe she has) and this is not me just saying that to spite her. I have no idea why the psychiatrist won't diagnosis her with GAD. I've seen how she behaves. I've read the DSM, I even had a discussion with her about her diagnosis and went through the features. ""According to its criteria, you must have 5 or more of the following symptoms, and experience them at least once a day for a period of more than 2 weeks:"" according to her she's only ever felt three. And she had a nervous breakdown in September and she did loose a lot of weight. I feel like she might have had an episode, but I don't think she fits the disorder. I am repeatedly suicidal. I have made an attempt or two. I have self harmed in the past (been clean as of late). I call her a hypocrite because when she was in therapy she was telling me ""Some of these people, they're bed is their best friend"" and I kinda agreed with that statement. Yet she continues to think I'm fine. Also neither of them understand not to take shit personally around my cycle. Because of my PMDD I've noticed I can come off extremely angry sounding, even when I don't mean to. And then they get pissed at me! Which makes me suicidal because idk. My brain doesn't like being yelled and accused of something I didn't do? I finally did some homework today. For some odd reason I say I'm feeling better. Even tho I'm actually a mess. Like I was thinking ""I just have to wait till school ends, then I can do whatever I want"". Bitch no I can't. I LIE IN BED ALL DAY AND WATCH YOUTUBE. And it's not even because I want to! I just don't feel motivated to do anything else. 

This post was supposed to be about the form mostly...and how I'm not sure if depression counts as a disability. But I think it impacts my life enough to count. I feel as I'm given more and more freedom, more time off and such and less strict guidelines. I find myself with nothing to do. I've been living for school for the past 6-8 years. I have started drawing again but that doesn't fill up enough time. Or sometimes I'm just SO unmotivated. The main good thing about my mom is that she is supportive of me getting a service dog..cuz my dad...not so much..😪life is getting to be too much I swear.",23Nov2019,1
23,"She really does believe she has mild ESP, can ""sense"" auras of others, and believes she ""predicted"" things out of the blue. She'll be ""struck"" with a ""certainty"" of something she can't possibly know. Once or twice she actually got something right, but otherwise is blowing up people's phones with implications she feels someone is in danger, or scaring off friends with her sudden ""insights"". Once in the middle of a church support service, she declared she felt the presence of an angel that just assured her this very emotionally sensitive topic for this person was going to resolve in this oddly specific way. She says she learned to start keeping these to herself, or people cut contact with her.

Her disrespect of others boundaries and independence is weird. All holidays, including other people's birthdays, revolve around everyone doing ""the song and dance"" of it so she doesn't emotionally break down. Eventually, people starting saying they didn't want parties, or cakes, or presents, or her trying to use against people that she blew 150$ on snacks and cake and decorations when people asked her not to (literally ""For my birthday, all I ask from you is to not do that. We're not having a party, and I don't feel in the mood to celebrate anything""). She took personal offense, and would then just spend the money to have treats by herself. Can't have fewer than 3-5 pets at a time. She'd get them when other household members didn't want them, insist that they're ""theirs"" or ""everyone's"" or ""the household's pets"", but physically couldn't take care of them herself. All of the pets always slept in her room on or near her bed.

Allowed her son to live with her, on condition that he do all the housework, yardwork, house maintenance, and renovations on the side. Flipped her lid and shut down any discussion if he pushed to pay her rent to live there as a normal renter tenant. Biggest complaint was he basically couldn't jerk off in his own room, or get drunk without getting lectured ""WHAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS AND I NEED YOU"". Gave him a room, but literally filled it so full of her stuff she never uses that all he could own was clothing, laptop, and blankets. The whole house was literally walkways, every closet, storage furniture, entire attic, and random corners filled with boxes or loose piles. Two car garage literally consisted of layered piles of holiday decorations over 6 feet tall. He's since moved out, cut contact, and has such personal issues with clutter his current room is literally empty with just a bed. She took his moving out very personally like it was a slap in the face.

Anybody have a clue what's going on with this woman? Her escapee son is my room-mate. The guy has no idea how people live, and tells me he had no furniture because he felt he needed to ask me ""if it was OK"" first but couldn't work up the nerve because it stressed him out too much.",23Nov2019,1

25,"I can not allow myself to show an emotional reaction in front of others. Gifts, praise, kindness, scoldings, discipline,  all are met with as much of a blank poker face as I can manage regardless of the emotion I'm feeling inside. (Although with the positive things listed above I can feel tears welling up quickly and instantly) Expressing emotion feels like being physically naked and exposed. It feels like I'm afraid that my emotions will be an uncontrollable bomb or monster if I don't hold them in. That I'll be vulnerable and unprotected. 

However I'm extremely susceptible to emotion inducing media. I'll tear up instantly for sappy and emotional movie scenes or music. (Usually not romance related but anything brotherhood/military/friendship/family/sacrifice related) I still tear up when Henry Blake goes home on MASH. Or when Mel Gibson's daughter cries out for him in The Patriot. Or similar tear jerking scenes with swelling orchestral music.

I want to make an appointment with a counselor who specializes in PTSD, but the last time I tried to speak to anyone about the incident I had a panic attack so severe that an ambulance had to be called. It wasn't until later that I found out it had been a panic attack (I'm not going to get into how horribly I was treated in the ER since I couldn't identify what was happening to me). I'm terrified that I'm going to have some sort of an uncontrollable episode in a counselor's office and have to be rushed to the emergency room again, and the counselor will be like ""fuck no"" and refuse to see me again.

31,"Title. All throughout middle/high school, and now college, I've always been the person to really want to be friends with people, text them first, and make the effort to keep the friendship going.

I'm the type of person who doesn't like to give up on friendships and I try too hard, because I want to be their friends. I always see the good in people even if they ""don't deserve to be my friend"" as I've heard I do.

Now here I am, freshman year of college, and I'm having the same issues again. Like yes, I have friends, but like, if I never texted anyone or made efforts to see anyone, no one would check in on me, or see if I was okay.

32,"Hi, I'm a 14 year old girl and I've been suffering from bullying for a long time, although now it's better than it was before. I never had any ""friends"", I mean, in some ways I did but I can't remember a time in my life where I didn't feel lonely. I had severe anxiety when I was in primary school so I can't remember much of those times but I know that I always ended up alone when I was with kids my age. When I went to middle school I only spent time with 3 girls who treated me miserably most of the times, they isolated me, mocked me and would often talk bad about me when I wasn't there, but I had no one else. In 7th grade I switched classes and I eventually stopped talking to them. In this new class there were way more girls than guys, and as I always found it easier to come closer to the boys, the girls would regularly shame me for that, calling me all sorts of names in my back and to my face witch made my anxiety sky rocket, and, as if this was not enough, I ended up getting involved and falling in love with one of my classmates witch played me hard and really broke my heart witch was the final stroke, after that I think I can say that I went through a really rough time dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts, during that time I also started having problems at home, my parents started fighting constantly and my dad started being abusive towards me and my mom witch later lead me to start cutting myself... (Sorry if that story was long)
Now, it all has calmed a bit down and recently I've been thinking about telling my mom about that, but should I even tell her? She has always been in disbelief when I tried to talk about what I feel and mental illness with her and she's always called me weak and told me to ""get through it already"", maybe I didn't approach it the right way but I don't know if she would understand, although she did put me in a psychologist (against her will because she thinks I don't need it that much). My psychologist doesn't know I cut myself and I'm still going through the process of stopping it as it kind of became an addiction with time.
I don't know what is the right thing to do now, should I tell someone? How? When? I have no one to talk about this with.

34,"I used to be friends with someone for 5 years. (I'm using they/them pronouns to change their identity) I was depressed, near-suicidal, and they helped me when I was in the worst shape I had ever been. We were like twins. We would talk about anything and everything. Sometimes we would just sit in silence, comfortable in each other's company. We even planned to move into an apartment together after graduating high school.

But we've recently had a very bad falling out. I said some things, they said some things. It was awful. They said that they were PURPOSELY avoiding me for the past few months. We've barely even hung out this year. But now it's over.

After a few months of thinking, I've realized that they may have been toxic to me. Here's a list of some things they've done.

1. I went to buy some Subway and texted them if they wanted anything. They asked for a white bread sandwich with just vegetables. So I buy the food and after giving it to them, they got mad at me. They yelled at me saying, ""WHO TF BUYS A SANDWICH WITH NO MEATS?!"" I told them I was sorry, they said, ""IT'S FINE!""
2. They came downstairs with a broken nail on their thumb. They asked me to give them a cup to put ice in. I gave them the cup and they used the hand with the broken nail and blamed me for giving them more pain.
3. I wait at their house for them to return from their usual shopping trip and when they do, they show off their purchases to their brother. And not me. They never want to show me what they bought even though we both like fashion.
4. They asked me for driving lessons, but only if I sit in the backseat because having an empty passenger seat ""makes them focus more.""
5. Every time they got a new boyfriend, they would refuse to make time for me. They would gladly show off their boyfriend to their friends and their brothers, but not me. Sometimes their boyfriend would come over and they would ask me to hide in the other room.
6. They are selective on specific things. A month before we split, they showed me their nearly-repainted room. They told me some plans they had for it, like color-changing lights, a dreamcatcher, framed pictures of their family. After the room was finished, I was never allowed to see it. They had no problem showing it off to their brother, but when I asked to see it, they immediately closed and locked the door. I tried knocking, but they said ""go away! I don't let anyone in here!""

Even though I know they may acted toxic and volatile to me, I still love them as my friend. I try to hate them, but I can't. I can't physically bring myself to hate them because I owe them my life. I will still have some love towards them. I will always hope the best for them.

I can't hate them. I love this person even if they hate my guts. Even after all the BS they've put me through, I will never tell them how much I suffered just for their happiness.",23Nov2019,1

I’ve been coping okay (he’s been sick since February  so I’ve had time to prepare). I feel mostly okay. That is, until today. 

My great aunt, who I was really close to, also passed away. She passed earlier tonight and I’m a bit of a mess (an understatement).

Also I'm not entirely sure my depression/anxiety is not situational, and I keep telling myself that if I changed my circumstances, I probably wouldn't need meds.

46,"Hi all, this is new for me. Trying to open up about my mental health, when I'm at my lowest points, hopefully it will help. I'm so so tired of everything.

A bit about me, I'm 27, male and suffering from anxiety and depression. Currently on 150mg sertraline and recently started councelling. 

I idolise the idea of not existing anymore a lot. (I want to take a moment to say I'm not going to take my life in the foreseeable future because I'm either cursed or blessed with worry of impacting others. The hardest thing in my life is worrying about everything I say and do in case it negatively impacts anyone else. Which is enough to prevent me doing anything no matter how much I want to stop existing.) It is an daily thing, part of my life, I'd go to the point of saying it's multiple times everyday. 

The worst part is feeling the world would be better without me, no matter how much I try to help people it never feels like enough to me. No matter how well I do at something or how much praise I get I feel like a fraud because people don't see me the way I do. 


I suppose this is when I should start getting to the point. I have performance anxiety. To anyone who doesn't know what that is, it means that I work fine during foreplay and other non-penetrative options but as soon as it comes to sex 2 things happen... I either can't keep it up or I can't finish. This is something I have had my whole life. I met my partner 6 months ago, and she is very understanding of most things, but this is something she struggles with. She suffers from severe depression and anxiety herself which is something we bonded over at the begining which was and is great. But the problem is that she sees it as something wrong with her, no matter what I do or say, she thinks it's because of her. And anyone who has experienced this or anything similar can attest that that is very much not the case. In fact it is the complete opposite. The more I want to have sex the worse the PA sets in. 

I'm so tired of being this broken person I don't know what to do. Believe me it's not just the PA that is getting to me. It's life in general, countless things that I just can't deal with. 

It's got to the point in this post that I'm waffling and not sure the point I'm trying to get to, or even what the point was of posting this, but my shrink said I need to try sharing and opening up more and here it is.

50,"This is going to be long, but if you’re going to answer, please read the whole thing. tl:dr at the end.

I made a new account to post this because I feel uncomfortable discussing the topic, and I’ve never opened up about it to anyone, whether online or in real life. I’m 16 and a junior, for further context.

When I was in 5th grade, I had a crush on this girl who I’d been friends with for years. As a guy, this was normal, as most of my friends had already done the same. We were in a “relationship” for a couple of weeks before breaking up, as most 10-year olds would lmao. However, this was the beginning of my journey with sexuality. Despite always having liked girls, as I started the 6th grade, I started showing more interest in guys - I still made sure to keep all my thoughts private. I feel so uncomfortable admitting this but I know I have to lol. I hadn’t received formal sex ed, and my parents never talked to me about it. As a curious but uninformed 11-year old, I began looking at pictures of guys online, which piqued my interest. I still had crushes on girls at my school, since it was the beginning of 6th grade and everyone was figuring out how relationships worked. However, these pictures made me more and more excited, and eventually, I stumbled across porn. The first time I ever masturbated was to a gay scene, and I feel like this forever altered how I viewed sexuality.

Most people, when they first discover porn, instantly become hooked. As hormone-driven teens, they keep coming back, watching whatever turned them on in the first place. I was the same way. Because I had such a strong response to my first experience, I exclusively watched gay porn for the next three years. I feel ashamed admitting this, because I come from a family that doesn’t accept these values, and I don’t believe they reflect who I am as a person. Growing up, I’d only been interested in girls. I feel like porn forever messed with my sexuality, since my attraction to girls kept declining until 8th grade, when it completely went away.

This has easily been my biggest insecurity. Throughout middle school, I was literally a closet homosexual, and I did everything in my power to hide it. Nobody would have believed I was, which made me feel successful, because I made a conscious effort to distance myself from the stereotype. Let’s fast-forward to the fall of my freshman year of high school. Everything was going great, and homecoming rolled around in October, which was exciting for everyone. I went with like 10 of my friends and asked out this girl that I’d been talking to for a while. After the dance, we all went out to dinner, and she came over to my place once everyone left. We watched some Netflix and cuddled until like 2, and even tho we made out, we never went any further than that. We talked until the spring, when we broke up, and we haven’t really talked ever since. This relationship was confusing because it was the first time I’d felt real passion for a girl since my stint in 5th grade. I felt so much more fulfilled with her than I ever would have been with a guy. I decided that I could fix my errors, and that became my goal.

I discovered r/NoFap in January that year. I had a plan to get rid of my homosexuality, and it legitimately worked up until yesterday, which is why I’m writing this. After going a month without watching any porn, I busted my first nut to a lesbian video. My idea was that after a month, my first nut would release at least 10x the dopamine that it had been releasing before. My brain would associate this stronger dopamine release with jerking off to women. Therefore, the more I did this, my brain would create a more positive association with being straight, and forget all the dopamine it had released as a result of gay porn.

The entirety of my sophomore year, I forgot all of my homosexual urges. I felt like I’d finally cured my sexuality, although I did feel turned on by the occasional hot guy. Being gay was a distant memory. 

However, I’ve let my mental health slip these last few weeks. My football season ended 3 weeks ago, and as a result, I haven’t had much to worry about when coming home from school. I still lift, keep my grades up, and go out with friends, but I feel like my life has been devoid of meaning. I began fapping again the day after our season ended. Of course, I only watched straight vids, and I had some of the best nuts of my life. The more I did this, though, the more my old urges began to return. They got worse and worse until last night, when I relapsed.

Last night, I came home from school and watched gay porn for 4 hours, jerking off at the end. I feel like I’ve regressed back to my middle school days, and I don’t know how to feel about myself. My sexuality has always been one of my greatest insecurities, and the feeling that I might be gay continues to eat away at me. Although I know that I’m bisexual, I want to get rid of all of my homosexual urges, for both religious and for personal reasons. I have nothing against the LGBT community, but I have a deeply-rooted desire to not be a part of it, for the good of my family and for my future. I feel better after writing this, but here’s what I want to know: how do I deal with being in denial about my sexuality? Should I just accept it, or should I keep trying to repress these negative thoughts?

tl:dr - despite considering myself to be straight, I only watched gay porn from 6th grade up until high school, when I found personal fulfillment in dating women. I feel like this forever altered my sexuality, because I never had gay tendencies growing up, but they appeared as a result of my curiosity which led to me watching the porn. I’ve been successful at repressing these urges from january 2018 up until now, when I had a major relapse and now I’m confused about where I’m at. Feel painfully insecure about being bisexual, and I don’t know how to deal with these negative thoughts, because they’re so all-consuming. I would accept it, but I have personal and religious reasons for not wanting to associate myself with the LGBT community - I’m not homophobic, but it’s just not who I am. Thank you",23Nov2019,1

Content note: suicide attempt, addiction, substance use

This is a video i made about my friend Chad. I think that mental illness is too frequently framed from an outside perspective in media - especially BPD, and especially when speaking about men. 

It's my hope (and Chad's) that by sharing this video, someone without BPD will learn something about the disorder, and that someone with BPD will feel a little less alone.

The previous video on my channel was also about mental illness (plus a cool antique truck!), ya know, in case folks are interested.

52,"Also first time posting here. 

Hi everyone, I feel like ive taken a big step today. My first intake appointment before my actual one in january(they book out far here—even at my reg doc I have to wait 5 or 6 months to be seen). What should I expect? 

Im going in for possible BPD(borderline personality disorder) and adult adhd. Ive struggled with these things since I was in middle school and Im now 23, a stay at home mother and hermit due to poor health and living in a high crime area. I tried to walk to the store 2 separate times this week after 2 years of not going out, with my toddler in tow, and already almost got hit by a car twice. I dodged the first one thankfully the second one noticed me sooner on the crosswalk. Nobody walks around here regularly so drivers dont pay attention to peds. Needless to say its just not safe to walk anywhere here. 

Can they help with my depression centered around my life situation and poor health? I have been sleeping most days with little energy, showering weekly, not eating as usual because food has become completely uninteresting and thats coming from a usual foodie who has a culinary degree. My sexual drive has been gone since I was pregnant last year so my hubs is struggling with intimacy and feels pushed away. 

Its not possible for me to go to regular counseling unfortunately. Hubs works all week long shifts 3pm-1am or later, offices close weekends, lyft rides would work but I have kid which isnt ideal in counseling sessions. My insurance wont cover anything online. Should I just get use to this as my life now and try to stick it out? Im hoping getting help for adhd and diagnosing and treating personality disorder will be enough for now. 

Thanks for reading if you got this far. I just want to know what to expect and what not to during a 2 hour intake appointment. Have a lovely day/night~",23Nov2019,1

Selfish? I won't deny that. But I would also like to think I learned to be more mature from this, and that people in the future know that what I may have said in the past does not reflect the person I am today.

Sometimes it's what if my family died but mostly shitty things happening to me.

She says the therapy is helpful, but from an outside perspective, I think she is even more intense than she was before and she and I are starting to think about medication (in addition to the therapy) as an option.

She recently described that her entire body felt like it was too small and she felt constrained to the point where it was painful.  She was in tears and hyperventilating.  There was no obvious trigger, she experienced this in the middle of a school break while we were relaxing together watching a funny movie.  When I asked how long she had been feeling that way, she said she couldn’t remember not feeling that way but sometimes she was able to distract herself from it.

I have tried to help her by teaching her meditation techniques and I also have tried to learn a little about massage therapy to relieve some of the physical effects of her anxiety. I think these are a little helpful in the moment, but they aren’t reducing the number of anxiety events.

He had been fine up until about 3 pm, and that's when his mood just went downhill. He got quiet; he was frustrated during practice, he had just been really off, it was easy for me to see that his head was in a bad place. I thought that if he's anything like me, he's getting frustrated because he's one of the only first-years on the wrestling team. I decided to leave him be until we both got home. I then chose to text him and ask what was going on. He brushed it off, said it was nobody's fault, said nothing caused him to be upset. I chose to make it clear that I knew something was wrong, but that I wouldn't push and it was left at that. Today I found that he didn't show up to school, and immediately I got worried. He was either stuck in bed or worse. I pushed it out of my mind and decided that I was just overthinking again, especially considering the fact that I have a long history of pretty graphic, vivid intrusive thoughts about friends and family dying or getting seriously injured. I messaged him when I got home and he admitted to lying to me the night before. Then he told me what happened. I won't go into detail, but he wrote a note and was close to attempting. I've been worried sick, it was hours ago when he told me and I can't get my mind off it. I texted him and asked if he wanted to hang out tomorrow or the day after that because I'm really wanting to keep an eye on him and make sure he's safe and he hasn't replied to my text yet. I'm so scared that something is really, really wrong. I'm terrified and I can't help but think of the worst possible things. 

This goes out to anyone who might be considering suicide: 

just hearing that my friend nearly attempted to end his life today has been eating away at me. Knowing that the outgoing, funny, friendly guy who always seems to smile was in tears while writing a suicide note today brought out feelings that I didn't know I was capable of experiencing. I cannot possibly imagine hearing that his little brother or mother found his body that night. I cannot imagine having to attend the funeral of a 16-year-old boy who's been struggling with depression for years.

This experience has been a violently rude awakening to me. I've been contemplating it for weeks now. I've imagined my own death hundreds of times over in just the past month. I've been going through the same thing as him, but the simple fact that he chose to open up to me without knowing any of these personal struggles gives me hope. I'm not superstitious, but I truly believe that this happened for a reason.

To everyone: Take a moment to relax your body and think about your life. Think about the good and the bad and the boring. All of it. All of it is what makes you human, all of the three are what it means to be alive. I care about you and your place in society and on this earth. You are an individual that is worth love just as much as the next. Stay strong, be there for one another and never forget to take a deep breath.",23Nov2019,1

I suffer from anxiety but for the most part have it under control.  I thought I was good....
But I’m not ok right now.  

This week I was living on a high.  New boy interest for the last month, jobs going well... but I lost it on my dad.  He’s a womanizer and a liar.  The thing is he damages the women he dates/marries,  not me.  It’s not my life so it shouldn’t affect me but it does.  

I’m finding myself feeling so much hate for him.  In turn, I’m starting to feel so much hate about me.  I don’t know why.  My thoughts are being sabotaged and I’m starting to feel negative and I want to shut everything and everyone out.  Including the new boy.  We have been seeing each other for a month and He asked how my day was and I told him I had a rough day and he hardly texted back.  Maybe he got busy but my sabotage thoughts are making me think the worse and I just want out before I get hurt.  

I guess I hate my dad so much that I’m fearing I will end up with a man like him.  

I don’t know how to not let it affect me and pour into my own personal relationships.  I’ve been up since 3am thinking about my dad, feeling “rejection” from the man I like and truthfully feeling like I want an end..... 
any words of advice would really help get me out of this low.",23Nov2019,1
80,"A bit all over the place.

So I am planning to start A group in school (6thform aged 16-18) for students who have a hard time making friends social anxiety (nothing extreme though like a personality disorder) students who want to make that change to be able to not be so awkward and talk and who are also looking to gain some confidence within themselves to prepare them for uni (university)
.
.
These specific students are usually labaled as the nerds ot dorks or loners it's sort of true but offensive so I'm not going to stick a poster saying ""club for loners"" so I was wondering as you suffer from social anxiety how would you describe yourself in a way.

I dont want to put up a poster saying club for confidence gaining or club for the bullied because it can easily mean the ones that are bullys can come too and I dont want that because its wouldn't be fair to the others.
or if I say hard time making friends would attracts foreigners who are confident just not comfortable in a new country and if I label the club  make friend it will attract anyone. 

problem is how to name it have any clues without it sounding offending.

again these students are always escaping people and shut away in the guidance room in books or computer they never lift their head up to see other students similar to them but then go home and cry on tumblr the good thing is they are good in school but they dont explore their passion they stay on the nerdy subjects because they have been labeld that way and that's not right.",23Nov2019,1
81,"I woke up and brushed my teeth, showered and remove bed sheets, then I started laundry ! And I haven’t been binge drinking for ~30 hours now. 

I know to normal people it seems totally normal, but I just spent about 2 weeks not wanting to get up. The days I had my dogs they were the only reason I got out of bed, only to open the backyard for them, go to my couch and hating the fact that I exist. If my mom had them I would spend all day in bed. Today I said, wait, mommy’s gotta take care of herself before we get up. So I showered for the first time since Monday and did something useful for the house for the 1st time in 15 days. I still need to brush my hair, which is now a big deal for me, knowing that before I took care of it like royalty, it’s so sad. And finish the laundry. But I am already so proud of myself.",23Nov2019,1
82,"Other than therapy (I'm already doing that but can't afford to go regularly enough for it to really help much), what are some things I can do to help overcome BDD?

I've been doing Keto and I've lost 43lbs so far.  I have 24 more to go to reach my 'ultimate goal' which is a weight I've NEVER been, even during High School.  And even after all that I'll still be in the 'normal' range of the BMI scale.  

I dream about being anorexic and just melting away.  And then I wake up terrified that maybe I messed up the diet and I've gained every pound back overnight.

I should be proud of the weight I've lost - but when I look in the mirror I still see it there.  I weight myself every day to make sure it's not coming back.  I cry when it fluctuates.  I try to fast as long as I can to make it drop faster.

83,"I'm curious, and I'd imagine it's an illness in itself and that's what I'd like to know. 

Why would somebody go to extreme lengths to try and prove they had some sort of mental illness?

Schizophrenia for example, theyd look up schizophrenia and then shortly after they would display behaviour linked to schizophrenia and then expect people to agree it's likely schizophrenia. 

The behaviour they do display a lot of naturally, is extreme manipulation. So the obvious reason behind it could be manipulation but what would push someone to manipulate to these extreme lengths? Even as far as self harming to prove they are unwell, mentally. 

It's clear there is a mental illness, just not the one they're trying to convince everyone of. 

I am trying so hard to understand this behaviour. They also say they're desperate for help but refuse to accept any help that is offered. 
Along with wanting to be diagnosed but refusing to assessed. 
Which again, goes back to manipulation.",23Nov2019,1
84,"I'm suffering from paralysing physical fatigue, lethargy, numbness, tingling, tightness and other sensations. It feels as if my brain is constantly struggling to restore itself and even stay alive. It's like being caught in the matrix - an uncertain void between existence and non-existence. I never feel entirely grounded in reality, even though I know I'm here.

I've been like this for over 10 years, with medical blood tests not showing anything irregular. It breaks my heart to know I can't engage in and interact with my environment normally and consistently like everyone else. What responsibility do I have for my situation?

87,"I thought the mental hospital was going to be too intense for me because I feel others pain and anxiety immensely. I didn’t know there were different sections for different levels/cases of patients. I’m in the “open area” where people still have some psychosis and panic attacks but they don’t put it on others. I can read people better than you can read a stop sign. I know the group of people I’m with are good people. One of the patients is in here because the mafia is chasing him for something he didn’t do and he’s super paranoid. I gave him advice and tried to get him to exercise with me because he needs to stop thinking about the mafia and more about his health and how to get better. Now he’s always coming up to me and it’s getting a bit hard but I’m patient. I know this will be useful one day when I have kids. I also met an American girl here which is rare she’s pretty cool. I saw a piano here in the common room so I thought I’d pass time by learning off YouTube how to play the piano because I want to play something for my crush by the time I’m out of here. That American girl plays the piano really well and I was really shy to talk to her but she came up to me and eventually the next day I saw her playing and sat next to her and asked her if she ever gets bored if she wouldn’t mind teaching me. She was like are you ready? So we already started and I’ve learnt some chords which is a good start that I now have to practice on my own until I need more help from her. I also wanted to arm wrestle the biggest guy here he’s 19 from the army in a fighter unit so he’s pretty big and strong haha and he said nobody was able to take him down so far.. I took him down 5 times or more lost count never lost with both hands... he knows Devon laratt too the arm Westing god basically.. so we got along.  He’s a big black dude so I asked him to play basketball and he destroyed me there haha but then we played some football and I scored more and saved all his shots.. I’m a sick goal keeper haha anyways I feel like I’ve brought the mood up here and I’m gonna keep trying to find the broken ones and put some effort into making them smile and laugh and just not feel so negative. I know I need to work on myself but this is making me satisfied. I’ll get my help soon I’m sure. I just have so much love built up inside me and I haven’t been around people for so long.  I miss you L  hope you’ve been doing good.  Wish I could tell you stuff and support each other through what we are going through. I know we are both going to get past this. We are fighters and we never give up.  My schedule will get busy from tomorrow, I was hoping I would have gotten to talk to you a little this weekend but it seems you are busy. Hopefully we can find some time to talk this week or next weekend. Hope B and J are doing good too.

89,"Gonna try to make this shirt. I'm a 26 year old male. 7 years ago, I was diagnosed with a serious heart condition, and almost died from it. I've since had surgery. And  cured, although the ordeal has left me with terrible anxiety. At first it was health anxiety. I was constantly thinking I had all these terrible disease, and have constant panic attacks. I got a dog 3 years ago thinking it would help, but it only made my anxiety worse. The responsibility for a life other than my own academy anxiety skyrocket. I was constantly experiencing unbearable guilt if I felt I wasnt giving my dog 100% all the time, even though I took her to the vet, what seemed like 1 every 3 months for things that weren't serious. The overwhelming amount of guilt pushed me into several periods of deep depression to were I wouldnt. Do anything for several months, except for think about suicide. Anyway. My dog died 6 months ago from mast cell cancer. It took me a while to not blame myself. I eventually got over the guilt, but the guilt, and worry shifted torwards other animals. Take my mothers cat for example. She 15, and I suggested my mom take her in for a checkup. She refused saying ""she looks healthy"" which obviously doesnt mean she is. I ended up taking the cat it, were she was diagnosed with a hyperthyroid. My mom, and I are now treating that, along with another issue. I'm very stressed about. Aslo, my dad just bought a house from an older couple, and they left there cat behind. I should be more specific. The couple both died, and my dad got the house. My dad has been feeding the cat, but his set of kind is that he didnt ask for the cat to be there, so it's okay if he neglects it. Okay, he gives it food, but everytime I go over there its water bowl is almost empty with green water, and leaves in it. There is a stream behind the house, but it might be filled with viruses. Ibe Franken from it a couple times, but maybe I just got lucky.i saw the same cat almost 10 miles away in town several times, so maybe it's got other people taking care of it? Regaurdless, I think I'm going to trap it one of these days, and take it to the humane society. My dad was okay with me doing it at first, but now hes telling me to leave the cat alone, so I gotta go to his house when hes not home, and do it.another think is there is a cat sanctuary near my work that I drive by every day.the cats are old. 16-17. I noticed it looks like one of the cats has a growth on its face. I couldn't get a good look, as it kept running away, so it could just be a regular spot, like it already has allover the body. I was just gonna ignore it, and trust that the owners would take care of it if it were a growth, because they went theought eh trouble of trapping another cat, and taking it to the vet, because it had a broken foot. And another thing, I use to work up in the mountains building trusses with a couple of guys. This was a little over a year ago. One of the guys brought his dog to work every day. Now, it may have had a clean water source somewhere. I just didnt pay attention at the time, but I caught the dog a couple times drinking out of the toilet, and a bowls with old looking water in it, but my coworker didnt seem too worried about it. I'm starting to think I should go back, and make sure hes not still neglecting his dog, or I'll feel guilty. That is if the dog is still alive. It was almost 11 at the time of me quiting a year ago. I dont know, sometimes I feel like my brain just searches for things to worry about, and that I'll feel this way forever, in which case I'll just kill myself.",23Nov2019,1
90,"I've been on and off meds for over 10 years, and the pattern is the same - I come off meds, decline rapidly, go back on meds. It's now been about seven months without mood stabilisers or antidepressants, and my anxiety medication was due to be increased but never was, and is no longer working. I'm struggling to function on a basic level. I'm physically and mentally exhausted, my brain alternates between depression sluggishness and anxiety rampages, and my paranoia is spiking higher than ever. I can't look in mirrors, I'm scared of hidden cameras, I'm frightened that photographs are watching me. The slightest thing sets me off on a breakdown, and I'm getting more and more suicidal.


It took *years* to get an appointment to see a psychiatrist, and when I did he told me medication was for the weak, and that I wasn't trying hard enough to get better, also that unless I was paralyzed or sexually assaulted, I had no reason to be depressed. I now have the option to see him again, and you can understand my hesitance. He accused me of drug seeking and of bullying my GP into prescribing *strong medication* (which was in fact prescribed by the psychiatrist's own team, on *their* recommendation). 


So now I'm feeling pretty mentally shitty, and I'm pretty sure I actually *do* need chemical help, but I don't want to go back and admit that to the man who said it would be the weak way out. I don't know what to do. 


Is it possible to *think* my way out of mental illness? I've had therapy and I try to use the techniques as much as possible but my mind is *relentless* and I'm so very tired.

96,"TLDR: My lifelong bff is suicidal. I don't know what to do or say. They had a parent commit suicide a while back and it's easy for them to justify checking out early, but they also realize how bad it would hurt everyone. How do I get an anti-therapy minded person to get the help they need? 




My best friend is battling their own mind, and battling hard... but I don't know what to do to aid in their battle. Now grown adults, I realize this sensation comes and  for most (including myself.) I love my friends, and this one in particular is family as much as my own sibling is. While we have both lost family to suicides, my friend is strongly against any form of professional help. Thankfully they reached out to me this week for companionship, I would be lost without them. Of course I will be there for every phone call and text, I have lived through many suicides and I don't know that my heart could handle losing my bff. 

I just don't know what to do or say, I have tried everything to get them out of their own head. I naturally want to take them for a long walk in nature, let them talk, let them cry. Give them hugs. But how do you get someone to see their own greatness when they argue every point you make (and list the facts to back it up.), And it doesn't help that I am an ex. So anything I say they justify that I don't mean because I once left them. (YEARS ago)

I don't want my friend to be miserable about anything, especially all the unfounded self doubt they have flying around in their own mind. I suffer from bouts of depression+anxiety so I realize it isn't something magic words can just *fix*, I realize nobody can do the work for my friend. But I don't want them to battle alone. I don't want them to feel like they are burdening me and run away if I mention something like therapy or a trained professional. 

For myself, working out and nature helped me overcome my own struggles, but my friend is more of a homebody than an adventurer. The last thing I want to do is push them too far out of their comfort zone and make them feel like there is one more thing in this world they aren't good at. 


So if anyone has any tips, I am all ears. I plan on getting them a blank journal, asking them to go for a mellow walk with me, and maybe talking over a meal. My dog is also pretty good at companionship therapy as well (and my friend loves the dog), so hopefully that will help.

97,"I had been on medication and in therapy for my mental health since I was 11. I;m now 25 While the meds certainly helped when I didn't have the skills to respond to stress effectively, I did not function in society on those meds. I've been put on over a dozen medications at the lowest doses to feel better mentally, but be sleeping for 20 hours/day, dissociate nonstop, and have neurological symptoms that prompted studies and 48 hour EEG's. On my most recent meds (Zoloft), I've been so tired and void of energy that I was unable to work since I was put on it. I literally was not awake for enough hours. I had genetic testing done to find that my metabolism makes me do better on lower doses, but no dose ever seems to be low enough. I figured that was the way the cookie crumbles, but then I had a lapse in my health insurance that is still not fixed. During that lapse, I ran out of sertraline refills and could not get more. I'm still in the process of getting insurance approved, and in the meantime, I've been off the Zoloft for a week and a half. After a few days, I started getting 8 hours of sleep, paying attention to conversations, eating more (compared to less than a meal a day), and while I'm more antsy, I'm coping with skills. It's been awesome, and when I get insurance back, I plan to talk to a psychiatrist about whether it's time to see how I do off the meds long term.

Here's my only concern: I'm used to going to psych hospitals to seek safety and supervision when I feel intensely suicidal. I've never been involuntarily committed, but have always been admitted for about a week. It happens maybe once a year. I'm conflicted on what I'd do if I feel this way in the future, since although I'd be supervised and have access to 24/7 mediation, taking meds would feel pointless to me because the side effects weigh out the benefits so much that I've had general practitioners and psychiatrists yank me right off the meds I got at the hospital because they know my metabolism better than the psych ward. But if I'm not allowed to refuse them and focus on therapy and other approaches (ECT, supplements) instead, I'd be med compliant. I really don't want to fall back into a cycle of stagnation because of how slowed down I get from the meds, but I also want a safe place to go if I ever feel unsafe.

So...in the US, can a voluntary patient refuse medication and ask for an alternative? My concern is that I'd either be discharged for noncompliancy or be moved to involuntary status. Are there other places I could go besides a psych hospital?",23Nov2019,1

101,"I’m 17 F.  2019 has been the hardest year of my life, I’ve just been quite out of it the entire year.

Here are some things that I observed about myself recently which I think are weird but have no idea if they’re  normal: 

1) I’ve lost interest in all the things I used to like. Like I don’t even feel any sense of excitement and motivation like I used to when I think about the hobbies that I had

2) On some days I can feel really happy one second and really sad the next, and I stay sad throughout the day. But on most of the days I’m completely numb aka I don’t feel anything at all.

3) more and more times have I caught myself  “fantasizing” / “imagining” different ways I could die in any situation.
Eg I could be crossing a road at green man and just suddenly picture a car appearing out of nowhere and running me over at full speed.
Or I could be in the elevator and suddenly picture the cables snapping, causing me to free fall down from the 20th floor.
Occasionally when I sit on the sofa beside my balcony on the 27th floor, I will all of a sudden imagine throwing myself over the railings and falling to my death, although in real life I don’t think I’ll ever do that. Most of the times these imaginations feel quite real too.

4) ive started to doubt people a lot

5) a lot of times I feel this physical emptiness in my chest or in my head, and I will have the urge to drive eg a screwdriver something through it to fill it up 

6) I sleep a lot. During usual school days I get 5-6 hours of sleep. But on any day that is not a school day I’ll be in such a deep sleep that I can only wake up after 12-14 hours of sleep. But whether I sleep 4 or 14 hours, I’ll still feel super tired and lethargic throughout the day.

7) I’ve feigned being sick a few times this year to skip school or to get out of a social situation

8) I get random sharp chest and abdominal pains 

8) I’ve cried a few times this year from stress but never as hard as today. Today I had a rough day at a part time job and I was also disappointed by someone whom I thought really highly of which made me more irritated and upset than I expected. In the evening I wanted to go into my younger brother’s room to joke about how angry I was, only for him to show me this very hostile face that he only started showing me recently and for him to slam the door in my face. After that for some reason I just went to the living room and cried. Hard. I don’t even know why I was crying because I don’t usually cry but at that moment I just felt really, really sad. 
Then I suddenly thought my mom, who went overseas a few days ago to stay for a month, and I just walked into her room, lay on the side of the bed where she usually sleeps, buried myself in her blanket and just started crying my entire soul out. And for the first time ever, I had to physically stop myself from jumping over the balcony.
I’m not sure if my breakdown was because of my pre period mood swings, but even those were never as bad as this. This was just very sudden and out of character for me. I’m also not sure if it’s because I’m just stressed about an important exam I have next week, or if my bad pre-period cramps was also a factor

Anyways here are just some things which I observed about myself recently which made me think: “is there something wrong with me?”

102,"Hey!

I'm so sorry if I am misusing the sub in any way but after a particularly difficult early morning, I thought maybe consulting the internet is my best bet for now so here I am.

I will try my best to be as coherent with this so if at any point I start to not make any sense or seem to have a jumbled story-- I apologize!

But simply put, I'm extremely particular with the things I do.

For example, there's this thing that had upset me greatly last night and gave me an immediate dread when waking up early this morning. 

Just a couple of days ago I've bought a laptop and already it didn't sit well with me since it had been preowned. I absolutely MUST have my things new and touched by myself and myself only! But I was on a tight budget and needed something now so, when I got home, I began to write a list on why I shouldn't sweat the fact of my laptop having been touched and owned by someone prior. 

This went okay-ish. I still get a slight pang thinking about it but it's in near perfect condition.

But here's where it gets tricky. 

Now, I hate setting up email accounts because they always don't seem to ""look right"" to me. I'm not the most creative thing on the planet and any ounce of creative genius I do have is immediately shot down by the fact that my emails MUST be short or my usernames for serious accounts ( unlike this one ) MUST be short and/or have some sort of meaning to it.

Yet I couldn't think of anything so I just used my full name and birth year. It didn't occur to me how ugly it looked until I booted up my laptop last night and this threw me off.

But I had ignored it for a bit. I decided I wanted to test out my new Steam game so I quickly tried to distract myself by loading it up and getting started.

Everything was alright save for the ongoing annoyance of having my bare hand touching the keys of my keyboard but I was enjoying myself nonetheless! But here's the thing, Steam has this feature where you're timed on how many minutes/hours you've been playing a game. This isn't too big of a deal except a family member decided it was an amazing time to strike up a conversation with me. 

I had forgotten I left the game running and ended up having a""time played""  total of an hour-- which is very, very misleading because I wasn't playing the game at all! This upset me so much that I packed up my laptop and decided to sleep for the night. 

Well, waking up this morning, it turns out that the problem didn't go away with sleep. My email is still ugly-looking to me and my Steam account is ruined by false information-- which makes me want to factory reset my computer and purchase the game all over again even if it means using my last cent. It bothers me THAT much. 

And I know deep down inside that there's absolutely nothing wrong with it yet my body and the more bold part of my mind reacts as though it's being faced with the most repulsive thing on the planet. 

I don't know what to do to calm myself down from these thoughts. These thoughts and feelings continues to ruin every aspect of my life from social withdrawal, to spending more money because something about the first product just doesn't seem right, to not pursuing a hobby because I know I will mess up ( Which is annoying because of course I will mess up! I am completely new to the hobby yet my mind can't fully wrap itself around that ).

I am currently trying to find some printable worksheets to deal with these things but I can't seem to find something that resonates and even journalling is stressful as hell. I just can't seem to enjoy anything.

110,"TLDR at bottom 
I feel like I might end up on r/iamverysmary for this post but I think I need help; so sorry in advance

 I hope somebody will actually go through this whole text

I've struggled with ""depression"" for a big chunk of my life, I arrived in a foreign country when I was 6, developed shyness, when I finally learned the language I had severe acne on my face - in result I had zero confidence and his away in video games. In high school I've been bullied and I very quickly understood I was very different from others, I started seeing that my parents have financial problems, that people in school are just stupid, that I don't fit in; but hey, what was I supposed to do ?

When I was 14 I started working out, and it became my new way to run away. It also became my first line of defence against the world, people finally didn't dare to bully me - but a sort of anxiety stick to me, and I feel like it is with me to this day.

I spend my life from age 14 to 18 in love with a girl, it was a really bad relationship, I was obsessed, she was the first person to accept me, to show me affection - we were together many times, we broke up many times, I was extremely bipolar during that time going from happiness to being suicidal in a matter of minutes; you get the idea.

The relationship ended and so began a really deep depression, I was at the rock bottom for more than a year after the break up - but I figured a way out of it, and I feel like I got so much more as a human being because of it - I feel like I'm so much more self aware and smart than everybody around me ( I know this sounds awful, and that's why it worries me because I know it's really bad I'm thinking that way).

A year passed since I got out of depression, Ixve been feeling good and bad, but not depressed - but lately I started feeling like depression literally let me go - like I'm free BUT with that started really weird behaviours, sometimes I feel extremely overwhelmed by my surroundings, I'm often blown away by thinking about reality, about what life is, I'll silently scream into my pillow because I feel this kind of pain you can't describe - and all of a sudden I'll realize what I'm doing and simply stop - and that's the case for any weird behaviour I might have. 

I know all of this is a very brief description, but my question is, should I see a therapist ? I know very well what's wrong with me, why I'm anxious, why sometimes I'll drown in past sadness - I feel like I'm self-aware enough to solve those problems by myself, so what would potentially seeing somebody give me ? And how should I even start talking about all of this ? (Because describing it like I did here is really misleading, I'm fine 90% of the time - but I'm not gonna describe you why I'm happy as that's not the point)

I also just fear that the therapist will simply be too dumb to understand what's going on in my head, and will treat me like ""another teenager with a broken hearth"" - and I kinda fear that I'll end up on some sort of forced psycho treatment.

My last concern is related to the fact I'm easily convinced to things; If I start worrying something is wrong with me I fall into a loop where I keep worrying more and more

TLDR
In short, my head is a mess, how do I seek help ? How to start speaking with a therapist ? And how to make sure I'm not gonna get treated like ""another teenager with a broken hearth "" ?",23Nov2019,1
111,"it's okay to eat. you don't have to count calories every day. a couple Hershey's kisses won't hurt. and I know it hasn't gotten that far but I see the way you contemplate hiding off in the bathroom after any meal bigger than a rice cake and forcing it back up. you can have one more slice of pizza if you want. your dad, who you haven't seen in months, is making breakfast and you can eat it all. it's okay. 

but.

the familiar twinge of hunger is just so comforting. and seeing the results after a week of hard dedicated limitation is so satisfying. you haven't seen a scale in three months and I know how terrified you are to see that you've even gained 5 pounds back. and there's just something so pleasing about being able to eat but knowing it's not going to stay in your stomach, right? and I know you're constantly searching for the best way to lose all that weight as fast as possible. you just haven't found it yet, so you better keep looking.

I know you haven't been able to stop thinking about eating and your body in months now, it's easily the most repetitive thought you have every hour of every day. most people don't think like this right? but... five more, ten more wouldn't hurt. a flat belly is worth it. seeing your hip bones is worth it. being desirable is worth it.",23Nov2019,1
112,"Ok- so....Death seems like a release. Ideally I would just like to not wake up. I don’t even know if I’m depressed- however I know I probably am at the moment- however I feel like this even when I don’t think I’m depressed. 

However I know for a fact I wouldn’t do it for two reasons. 1. The risk of not doing it properly. My job means I’ve seen the repercussions of things ‘not going to plan’.  2. I wouldn’t want to do it in a way that impacts others. Jumping in front of train or into traffic to me- right now- I couldn’t do to someone else. Or an attempt at home and a loved one finding me I don’t think I could do also. My parter has already told me that’s her worst nightmare. I wouldn’t want to upset my loved ones.  

So I’ve had  ONE fail proof plan of how I *could* theoretically do it if I had to- but I no longer have access to those resources anyway. So honestly I have no idea how I could do it if I wanted to now. 

So I have these feelings- I know I won’t do it. Is it normal to feel like this? Have these thoughts? I know I  won’t do anything. And I know people who do have attempts at taking own life must be in such a bad place where they can’t even rationalise the reasons why not to like me so I feel like a fraud even asking these questions.

118,"It's been more than 5 years now. It all started one month where I suddenly didn't have the urge to eat at all. I ate like 1 or 2 meals max per day which I couldn't even fully finish. It stopped for several months then it had come back for others. This pattern of on and off has been going for a solid 3.5-4 years, then I've started to notice (I'm not really sure at which point though) that any change in my mental state make me nauseated. If I was neutral then experienced brief happiness? Nausea. If I experienced sadness? Nausea. Anxiety? Nausea. Watching a movie and got really into it? Nausea. I'm actually feeling nauseated from this nausea.  


A bit about myself

I have a history of mental disorders but not sure which since the 2 doctors I've gone to never gave me a clear answer. The first told me that I had Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder and that was more than 4 years ago.  
He prescribed Zyprexa then Prozac to me. The former did absolutely nothing while the latter made me feel 'in control' for a month or so but then I regressed. I've to say that Zyprexa made me regain my appetite for a month or 2 though after which I've lost my appetite again.  
The second one hasn't given me a clear and proper answer at all. I was told by my mother that there is nothing I had in particular. I just had a bit of everything. So what he prescribed for me was a cocktail of antidepressants and anti psychotics. None of them worked. Actually, the only change I've felt was their side effects. That was 2-3 years ago.   
I've finally got sick of it all and ignored everyone and stopped taking my medications. It wasn't a sudden cessation but it was a bit ahead of the doctor's schedule. In fact, I've ceased to take all of my prescriptions and my doctor knows nothing of it. Every time I've had an appointment with him he'd adjust the dosage but I'm not sure according to what exactly.  
I've completely stopped the medications for 6 months now. Guess what? No change. At all. My emotion-controlled appetite is still the same as years ago. My mental state is still the same as the first time I've gone to the first one.  


I'm sorry for the long post but be certain that I've tried to cut as much details as possible. A lot happened between these time periods but did not impact my mental state at all. A lot of ups and really really downs if I want to summarize it. Help",23Nov2019,1

121,"Hey folks. Lately this sub has been chalk full of suicide posts. Why am I on this site? Well I have major treatment resistant depression for the last 2 years. For 2 years I have fought for my mental health tooth and nail searching for proper treatment and it hadn't been easy. However I've never been suicidal. 

So why am I posting this? You see I'm no stranger to the effects of suicide and suicide idealization.  2 years ago I was told my teen age son was at risk of self harm. As a mom I was scared shit less. Pure fear for my son! I put everything on hold to get him the help he needed. And today he is a thriving teenager. 

Yall that isnt my first experience with suicide. You see I know just how serious this is. One day when I was a young wife I got a phone call that a neighbor teen who had been friends of our family decided that being dumped wasn't worth living for anymore. He came home from school and while his parents slept in the room down the hall he shot himself. I can not explain the utter shock and loss this was. Really there aren't words for this tragedy. He was just a young teen boy with his whole life ahead of him. His parents doted on him and he was super popular at school. He had so much going for him. And in 1 instant it was all lost. Much more than lost. A whole family and community was ripped to shreds over the loss of this bright and wonderful boy. 

There are more stories like this in my life. A wonderful man coworker who lost his wife to suicide.  He didnt just lose her though he lost a step child in the process because he no longer hand any right to be in his life. The pain this man felt was palpable when he walked by. When he did have the energy to speak about it he couldnt believe she even had these thoughts. Another loss of life of a wonderful wife and mother. 

I can tell you all day about the pain the survivors feel at the loss from suicide. I can tell you that they question everything in their lives. Why didnt I see the signs? Why didnt they say anything? What could I have done to cause this? Yes many survivors blame themselves. 

I can also tell you that survivors also do not understand the emotional and mental pain those who commit suicide feel. They know it must be immense. They know it must be so crushing to feel this way. But they dont understand it. They dont understand it because they dont feel it. They dont k ow how someone could feel this way. It's not that they are uncaring. They do care and if you feel like suicide is the answer then you need to tell someone you love so they can help you get help. 

You wont see me posting replies to suicide posts. I'm sorry it's way to triggering for me. My heart breaks for you and I really wish you all the best in your life but an internet stranger isnt likely able to help you. You need a real professional, one that is skilled in treating this. 

I beg you to please seek out the suicide hotlines that are posted everywhere. Reach out to your family doctor. Talk to a school administrator.  Talk to ANYONE in real life. Someone is willing to help you that I promise!",23Nov2019,1
122,"As I’ve said I’ve had many head injuries since I was about 4/5, I’m 28 now.

If they are on this ""herb"" and having a hallucination, rather than the person seeing a monster and running away or feeling fear and trying to run away and avoid it, the person just allows that feeling to be there, and faces the monster in terror, then they realize this can have profound healing qualities on the person and really shift their relationship with life.

126,"I have struggled with depression and anxiety since around middle school days. I am now 24 and I live alone and across the country from my family and any sort of support system that I had established during college. So it has gotten worse in the past two years or so.

128,"Alright, so this may end up being a long post, and it's going to be completely honest. I'm not used to being this honest but it's the only way to make sure.

I find it impossible to fully be myself when I'm around other people. I instinctively find myself adapting and attempting to become the most likeable person in the room in any given situation. I will reflect the likes and dislikes of those around me, or at least, the ones I take a liking to. I will lie with little effort when necessary, and let little bits of my true feelings seep out when it's useful. I don't like to stray too far from the truth, I take great care to keep a consistency to any lies I have to tell, so that they're easy to roll with and mesh well with lies I may have told others in the same social situation.

I try to find the person closest to my actual tastes to try to become friends with, so I can be more myself with them. I love making friends, I crave attention and admiration, and I acknowledge in that way I'm most certainly narcissistic.

I have a particular method to what I do that makes me question if its true psychopathy, sociopathy or something else. I go above and beyond to put in extra effort whenever I can for others, both personally and professionally. If I get anything from anybody I always give back one way or another. If it were anybody else, you'd have reason to think that makes me normal, or better, but it doesn't. I put up the appearance that I do it selflessly or because I like a person, but in reality I do it because I know it builds trust and makes people like me more. The sort of trust and bond you can form doing this stuff is far worth the effort in my opinion. Not only do I get the praise I crave for it, but people even try to give back to me, and will do favors for me that they would never consider otherwise.

It's cold, and that's why I think it may be psychopathic, but other people love it. I also don't go so far as to manipulate people as blatantly as you hear psychopaths do. I'm not abusive in my relationships, though I can be reserved when I'm expected to be more close and cuddly. I do lie to everybody, though I like to have it set up so I can lie the least to those who I have closest to me, because I'm paranoid that I'll end up caught between conflicting stories among people I know or something like that. That sort of stuff only happened to me as a kid so far, I've been much better about avoiding it since I became a teen and eventually an adult, but I still worry. I don't steal from anyone, nor do I have any interest in committing any other sort of crime.

I've learned that I'd benefit the most from almost anyone if I treat them well. A good reputation makes for a fantastic shield, and the more selfless, nice and understanding I can seem, the tougher the shield is. That way, if I end up having to lie or something it doesn't impact my reputation too much, and I can still be liked and have friends.

For that reason, I somewhat care about other people, in a roundabout sort of way. I can read people very well, I'm very good at picking up their emotions and can gauge my reactions to them based on lots of factors. If they respond well enough to my charm, I want to impress or otherwise entertain them, because I want them to like me. I suppose a more accurate way of putting it is that I don't care about people, I care about what people think. Everything in my mind is 100% laser focused on being as agreeable to the person I'm interacting with as possible.

So I guess I don't know if that counts as a lack of empathy or not. As well I'll also admit that I'm pretty spineless. I have anxiety due to some experiences from my childhood and I'm pretty much terrified of making anybody mad at me, anger in others gives me panic attacks. I think that may be the reason I don't do anything seriously malicious to anybody, I'm scared of getting yelled at or hurt.

I guess to sum it up in a TL;DR:

I lie to everybody, I love attention and I don't think I have genuine empathy, but I still behave almost exactly like somebody who has lots of empathy because I'm laser focused on being ultra nice because I'm phobic towards the anger of others. So if I'm a psychopath, then I'm a harmless one I guess, though I suppose that'd be up to those reading and judging this for themselves.

Also I guess to explain the issues I have with anger:

My dad used to yell at me a lot as a kid over little things, and I developed a fear of it because he was a big, imposing, loud and fit guy. I genuinely think most of my ability to adapt so well to others and seem so perfect to them was developed to try to cope with my Dad, to minimize how much he'd yell at me and break my stuff.

129,"This is not really a question, I'm mostly just ranting here. 

I just find that people are great for saying things like ""I'm always here if you need me"" or ""call me anytime"", and then when you do they have something else going on. 

Of course I get that that's just a part of life and we're all plodding along doing our thing, but it can really irk me when it happens as sometimes it comes across like they're just not interested. 

It takes alot of courage for a person to come forward and seek that support they were once told they had - that I'm sure was initially offered with the best of intentions - but then it transpires that support isn't actually there and it makes it a hundred times harder to reach out to someone again. 

Giving each other the time of day is so precious. 

More precious than social media...

More precious than TV...

PlayStation or Xbox... 

Books... whatever it may be. 

If we know someone is struggling we need to make a conscious effort to show that we care. Actively listening to a person can help change their world for a while. 

Yes I know at times people can't just drop everything! But make some effort to check in when you get a chance. And let them know that you will.

People also need to stop plastering posts about mental health all over Facebook and Instagram and if they want to make a 'real difference' get out there and take an active interest. Get involved! See what's happening in your community. If there's nothing, then start something up! Sharing a post on Facebook is going to do sweet FA and does not make you a hero. 

Sticking to your word by being there, and listening. Being approachable, available. Showing a genuine interest and being kind and caring - those are the things that will make you a hero. 
And you don't have to be a mental health expert, or have any training to do that. You just have to care. 

It could save alot of pain for someone. It's all anyone wants. Is to know that they are cared for. And that they are worthy of that care. 

Please consider this the next time you know someone is trying to reach out. 

Look up from your phone. 

Pause the game or the TV. 

Let them know that they have your attention. It can make a huge difference to their day to be reassured that someone wants them around and wants them to be alright.",23Nov2019,1
130,"I'm scared and I feel I am an outsider compared to everyone else. ""No one"" gets to their mid 20s unable to even know how or if to reply to flirting. How to know what's like to ""have feelings"" for someone, or what to say. Is it anxiety, depression, broken brain, something else?

Never been in a relationship or flirt with anyone. There's multiple reasons, period. There was only one guy I ever had feelings for and was 7 years ago... it didn't end well because mental health issues. I have trust issues, not just with the opposite sex but people in general. And honestly I'm scared I'll get close to someone and they'll go ""fuck this shit"" and leave if my mental health goes bad... or if I am not as ""normal"" as I should or they expect. Or get taken advantage off in a whole different level than before

And worst is I don't even have close friends I can talk to about this, I never did. I hate being vulnerable, but also hate asking others what I should do. Their support, their advice. Not sure I should even approach my friends with this. Thus me being here, lol, am I right?

I just want to know I'm not alone in this... or if I am, like what's the others people view. Its making me anxious, I feel very put on the spot. To have my own father say I'll be single for life... to see stupid shit online like ""women have it easy""... its not helping. Makes me feel I should steep lower to the first guy approaching me and hope it all goes well, when all my senses say ""nope, this has abandonment written all over it"".  

It's not the only thing contributing to me feeling stressed out like shit is this... but right now I just... want some answers?? Sorry about this. Hope makes sense, I don't even know if this is worded well

131,"Hey all. Lately my mental health (which i believe I've been managing well but looking back im not so sure) and as such ive decided to go to therapy to see what's going on with my brain, but I can't therapy, and I'd need to save for a while before I can even start. I havent looked much, I'll admit but i can't even afford talkspace, which is wildly cheaper than any therapist i can visit physically. Is there a cheaper way to get help or am i gonna have to hold on until i have enough money?",23Nov2019,1

I just find that people are great for saying things like ""I'm always here if you need me"" or ""call me anytime"", and then when you do they have something else going on. 

Of course I get that that's just a part of life and we're all plodding along doing our thing, but it can really irk me when it happens as sometimes it comes across like they're just not interested. 

It takes alot of courage for a person to come forward and seek that support they were once told they had - that I'm sure was initially offered with the best of intentions - but then it transpires that support isn't actually there and it makes it a hundred times harder to reach out to someone again. 

Giving each other the time of day is so precious. 

More precious than social media...

More precious than TV...

PlayStation or Xbox... 

Books... whatever it may be. 

If we know someone is struggling we need to make a conscious effort to show that we care. Actively listening to a person can help change their world for a while. 

Yes I know at times people can't just drop everything! But make some effort to check in when you get a chance. And let them know that you will.

136,"Having a row with my mum, to which she calls me a, and I quote ""fat freak""??? Honestly , I know I was saying some pretty mean stuff but it kind of stuns me because everyone knows that my weight and my body proportions are one of my biggest anxieties, along with my facial features -I always feel depressed when I see good looking guys as I have to remind myself that they're never going to bother even interacting with a fat ugly fuck like me-I also feel very uncomfortable around other women , particularly (and I'm not being racist at all by saying this ) Japanese/Chinese women as generally speaking , they tend to have very slim, petite figures and delicate facial features (nice eyes, flat, straight noses etc.) , All of which I dont, and probably will never own. To me it feels like other people cannot accept the fact that I don't have cover-girl style features, and that makes me depressed. No one wants the unfiltered , lazy day version of me, I feel like the only way anyone would want me is if I dress myself up and slap on five layers of make-up. It seems that other people cannot accept that I wasn't born with perfect or conventially attractive features-I have lots of sh scars on my left arm, one on my stomach, as well as scarring on my leg from where I burnt myself (by accident on a noodle pot), my hair is never sleek or straight regardless of how much effort I put into attempting so-i feel deep down that even my closest friend knows I'm ugly , I feel like this because I messaged her once telling her I was going to get plastic surgery and all she replied with was ""Oh""-Surely if she genuinely thought I was attractive she would have tried to convince me that it wasn't necessary as I looked fine without it ?

139,"Maybe this isn't the place to ramble about my life story or whatever. But here's some context to how low I've fallen.

* I grew up with strict/overprotective/toxic/emotionally abusive parents/family. For nearly the first two decades of my life, I lived in a volatile mental warzone. Petty arguments and unpredictable blow-outs and sometimes things breaking. I also faced bullying in school growing up due to being smaller and weirder than most kids. Then again, it was a small private school so there wasn't a lot of variety. 
*  In spite of that, I grew up with a lot of high hopes and expectations. A quick learner.  I knew how to read full sentences at age 3. I also started developing perfect pitch at age 5. Mom found me a music instructor or something. I was probably the kind of turd you'd label ""gifted and special."" I consistently got good grades, even in high school, and even when placed in advanced classes. I grew up seeing myself as brilliant and resilient. I had so many hobbies. Music, art, drawing, singing, dancing, making websites (simple html), making (simple) games. Maybe I had an ego problem. Again, I actually \*was\* pretty weird. And maybe all of this stuff, in retrospect, was my form of escapism from my family. I sucked at socializing and connecting to people.
* Fast forward to high school. I enjoyed my time in its Science and Tech program. I continued my variety of hobbies and even picked up martial arts, photography, and creative writing. And inevitably, talks about what to do with your life came up. I got somewhat better at socializing and being likable. I started to question my abilities in comparison to my peers. I started realizing that I found it hard to stick to one thing. I started asking questions like: Do I wanna go into something artsy? Do I wanna go into science?
* I graduated and was (begrudgingly) forced by my parents to commute to my in state college. I ended up choosing Computer Science because it seemed like the most lucrative/interesting thing based on my experiences in high school. I also tried to double-majoring in either Graphic Design or Music. Both of those things bombed. Both times I failed to get into the programs were big oof because I felt like I did my best only to let the anxiety get to me. I ended up making friends in a student organization that I really enjoyed. Enough to take up a leadership position in it. This was major progress for someone who was super sheltered and anti-social. They also helped me realize the family issues I lived my life denying. 
* But alas. I spread myself too thin. **Cue in: THE BURNOUT.** Just as I was starting to get accustomed to Compsci classes (and also getting bored of it), I hit the weed-out class. The workload from being in the student leadership thing (which I stuck with due to the professional experience, the variety of activities, and the emotional support of everyone there), the horrors of being in a weed-out class when your study skills are shit, and the stress from continuing to put up with my toxic parents, broke me mentally. I had to spend the remainder of my college years recovering from that and also realizing that the desire to get away from my parents ASAP subconsciously influenced why I wanted to go into Compsci to begin with. 
* My experiences and my constant struggle to commit to a \*thing\* caused me to think about things like freelancing or getting some mundane part time job so that I have room for hobbies. With this in mind, I graduated with an English major and Business minor. And less than a year after that, I pooled up my savings and basically fled my parents to live with my boyfriend (who has been there for me during my worst moments in college and suggested the idea of me getting away from my parents.) 

Life is more peaceful, and my social life is better. I'm enjoying the day-to-day freedom and learning opportunities. But I can't help but feel like a shell of who I was and who I could have been. I could barely touch the piano without wanting to cry (and it's been something I've spent 10 years mastering!) I've abandoned most of my hobbies. Sometimes, I find it hard to do what I need to do. Like I'm tired of being pushed or having to push myself... 

No, I didn't end up freelancing as a writer. I tried, but it was unfulfilling and scummy. Nowadays I'm deluded myself into thinking that I could make it as a digital artist and blogger, so long as I buy myself a few years to try establishing myself. Of course, I haven't told my parents about this change in aspiration nor do I want to. I managed to leave because I was able to convince them of how promising freelance writing could be. And the last thing I need is mom nit-picking and trying to micromanage me in a way that makes me resent what I'm doing. (she has a history.)

I feel like my time is numbered. I'm still managing to get by with my savings somehow. Sometimes, perpetual procrastinators such as myself jump into action under certain conditions because *survival.* Of course, the idea of trying my best and then failing under pressure (again, something that contributed to **The Burnout**) still scares me. I don't know how my boyfriend continues to put up with my presence and indecision. For whatever reason, he loves me and still thinks I'm great. As thankful as I am, I don't want to become indebted to him. I don't want to disappoint him. Also, he's pretty darn aware of my issues so it's not like I've been bottling stuff from him. My parents have actually gotten worse ever since I left, so I avoid them even more. The only thing stopping me from cutting them off is because they'd likely search for me/eventually find me/all hell would break loose. So there's no way I'm returning to live with them unless the other option is death.

Also, I low-key am afraid of working too much and burning out again. Though I've improved at being more emotionally aware of myself, I still suck at it and am sometimes prone to trying to do too much.

So yeah. Here I am, today, and I still feel like I haven't recovered fully. It's been 2 years since I moved. As much as I would like to work on underlying issues, I don't know where to start. I've tried Betterhelp (which was more affordable and discreet than say finding a therapist while I'm still under my parent's insurance.) But even that is too pricey to continue doing. 

How can I get my shit together and not waste my goddamn potential? How can I deprogram from all of this crap and feel at peace with myself? Can I find a balance?",23Nov2019,1
140,"For a while now, I've just felt incredibly numb. I still go to school, have a social life, etc., but I really don't feel much anymore. I've started to purposefully put myself through the symptoms of depression.

I don't know why I do it, I just want to. Maybe it's attention, I really don't know. I've looked into Munchhausen syndrome, but even they have a limit. I think at some point I'll kill myself as the last test or ""proof"" for depression. I started talking to a psychologist, but I've only talked about feeling numb.

143,"In 2011 my entire life went to shit. For the next four years my life would get progressively worse. But for about 3 years my life seemed to be getting somewhat better but as of March this year, my life took another downturn and I’m at the lowest I’ve been in years. I still live in the same abusive household. I’ve tried the following and none of it worked. 

1.) moving in with other relatives
This didn’t work because nobody else in my family has any room for me. 

2.) dating an old friend of my mom who is around my age
It took months for her to accept my friend request and according to her, is already married. 

3.) trying to get my aunt to ruin my mom one more time for me. 
Didn’t happen. She did nothing and even told my grandma about what I said. 

4.) moving into this apartment place at this mental health center
My grandmother told them something that resulted in my application getting turned down. Now I’m gonna have to go to this program for 3 - 6 months just to get into there and even then I doubt it’ll work out. 

5.) reporting my mother for fraud
She essentially is leeching off my disability money while having no job herself. She’s a fucking parasite. And yet they never responded to my report. 

6.) asking for a moped so I can get help with independence
They wouldn’t let me have one. 

7.) applying for college
They called it off. 

I’ve tried pretty much everything at this point short of going homeless and selling my ass on the street for money. They won’t even let me have my own fucking money. I’ve gotten so pissed off about it recently because I can’t stop thinking about it that I’ve elbowed countless holes in the walls of my bedroom, tore up their plants, busted glass and destroyed other shit in the yard and also developed a habit of knocking things over and spitting on the walls.  I’ve gotten to where I just don’t care anymore. I’m apathetic. I’ve tried reaching out for help throughout the span of nearly a decade and nothing has been done.

145,"I posted the following on r/aspergers, but I'm curious to hear people's opinions.

I haven't pursued an official diagnosis, so I wouldn't call myself on the spectrum, but I do feel a lot of the symptoms resonate with me and I can relate to a lot of autistic experiences.

Anyway, disclaimer out of the way, addressing the title. I feel like I avoid socialising and don't enjoy when I do it. But despite this, I still get lonely. I use to have social anxiety, and thought that was the reason why I didn't enjoy socialising. But then I overcame my social anxiety. So then I thought that maybe I'm just not meeting the right people. So I forced myself to meet a lot of people (not very successfully but still) and found that I couldn't ""connect"" (whatever that means) or just didn't feel right.

Now I'm in a place in my life (only 22 going on 23 btw) where I just have stopped trying. I don't feel depressed, I just don't care about fitting in or forcing to be something I'm not. But I still get that lonely feeling from time to time of wanting to have something I've never had (at least in recent memory).

I was always a bit of a loner growing up, always doing my own thing. But I started having serious feelings of loneliness when I started university at 18 and had to fight a 2.5 year depression. Now I feel like I'm out of the woods, but I don't what to do.

Without getting too far into it, it’s just my mom, my sister, &amp; me. Our lives have been hell - independently &amp; collectively. We all suffer from several mental health disorders - my mom &amp; sister’s undiagnosed, though very obvious. 

This year has by far been the hardest year of our lives, especially for my mom. It’s been bomb, after bomb, after bomb. Up until this point, she’s acknowledged that she needs help but has refused to get it. She’s always been suffer in “silence” type. Though the silence isn’t very silent, if that makes sense. 

The past few months have been especially hard on her and she’s losing it - her memory is shot, her emotional fuse is short, esp anger and sadness. I can see it. She can feel it. But still, she’s just trucked on while not handling anything. It finally caught up to her. 

She took my car yesterday afternoon and I hadn’t heard from her until a little bit ago. I have severe anxiety myself and admittedly was blowing her phone up. I’m sure this didn’t help, but apparently she had a panic attack and passed out in the next state over earlier today. She’s in the ER &amp; they’re monitoring her while she calms down, and advised her to get help locally. 

We do have a mental health facility’s satellite location in the next town over. She’s going to call them Monday. The thing is, they take sometimes 2-3 weeks before they can see you, and I don’t think she can last that long. And as someone who’s been there as an outpatient, it’s kinda useless in terms of guidance, just counselors who talked too much about God and getting outside for my taste. But they do give free medication, so there’s that. 

What are some coping skills/methods that I can show her to help her manage her thoughts and feelings until she can be seen, and even afterwards as she continues treatment to work on her issues?

I’m going to introduce her to journaling so all that negative isn’t just trapped inside of her but I really don’t know what else to do.  TIA",23Nov2019,1

In the same way, I’ve never felt any excitement or happiness towards anything really, I just shrug it off as “sure, that’s nice I guess”.

The event that actually triggered this reflection is the death of another relative 4 days ago. Again, my family members were all crying and when I got the news I just didn’t care, I think? I just stared at them not knowing what to do and left. Later one of them came to me and said that I was behaving weirdly and that I should have at least lent my shoulder for them to cry on but I couldn’t understand what the fuss was about so I couldn’t really begin feeling empathy towards them. 

The only feelings I can remember are strong feelings of anger or irritation but that’s it. I remember just last week in class someone was cracking their knuckles and I just got irritated and imagined hammering his knuckles and hearing the sound of the cracking bones. At that moment I felt my heart drop and a rush of excitement overtook me and I couldn’t help but smile, maybe I was happy? I’m not sure 

Anyways, what I’m trying to find out is what I could be considered as, if not another normal person? Because to me, well, I don’t feel abnormal. What do you think?",23Nov2019,1
161,"Bit of a vent.. My ex and I have been on and off for a while. We've both been trying to fix things but it's worse than ever for us at the minute and I really think it's the end of us. I genuinely thought that he was the one for me and it's so weird not having him around anymore? I feel like a huge part of me is gone because he was there for everything for such a long time and I don't know how to push my feelings aside and pretend like everything is fine. I find myself crying randomly and it's only so soon before people start asking why. I have a diagnosed anxiety disorder which has only got worse and worse whilst our relationship has been deteriorating and I'm honestly at rock bottom. I have one friend that wants the best for me but.. I was wondering if anyone had suggestions or similar of how to distract myself or get over these awful feelings as quickly as possible because it hurts so much feeling like this. I want to fight for this relationship but I really don't think he does, and at the end of the day I just want him happy and safe. Thanks in advance guys.",23Nov2019,1

Does anyone have any advice for dealing with unsupportive parents? I’ve recently started trialling antidepressants for an anxiety disorder. I won’t delve too far into it, but to put it into perspective, I was having panic attacks on the daily and it affected my work/social life pretty badly. I’ve had to put things on hold to focus on getting better. My family around me of course have seen how anxiety has affected my life, especially since June 2018. Despite this, my  mum really doesn’t agree with me trialling the meds and is giving me such a hard time about it. Some of the reasons being- she is very Christian, and believes the only thing that can ‘make you well’ is god. She doesn’t view mental health as illnesses. She also hasn’t done the research, so believes the stigma around antidepressants, like it zombifies you/addictive etc. I try to have an adult conversation with her and say, I respect your opinion on this medication, but I don’t agree and I need to do what is best for me at this time. To which, she will heavily guilt trip &amp; shout at me. It’s quite confusing, because on one hand she’ll say I want to be involved (know what’s going on), but then she’ll minimise my problems massively. Ive been signed off by the doctor, so I’m not working at the moment. Which means I don’t have the funds to move out etc. I’m just finding it all overwhelming, trying to get through this difficult time whilst facing this opposition is making it worse. I don’t know how I’m supposed to get better in an unsupportive environment. 

Thank you to anyone that took the time to read this/respond.

163,"Idk where else to post this so sorry if this is the wrong place ...
It's basically as the title says and just need to post it somewhere before I go crazy lol.
I'm seriously stuck in this weird paranoid cycle of thinking everyone including professionals and my tutors and friends ect actually really can't stand me or they think I'm a sad waste of life and I don't have a clue how to get out of it or stop thinking like this?
It's making me anxious to the point I don't want to hang out with anyone or talk to anyone incase I'm right :/
Anyone have any advice or maybe understand this feeling?
It's really ruining everything right now for me :/",23Nov2019,1
164,"I honestly just feel like dying. I feel like I’ve tried everything. I’ve felt this way since I was 12 and it hasn’t gone away. Still. I keep thinking about just wanting to hurt myself, I know if I started self harming again I’d disappoint a lot of people if they found out but I miss the feeling. I need to hurt myself just to feel something different from  consistent numbness. It’s difficult. I’m really struggling. I want to know when I’ll just feel ok, but I don’t think I ever will. I don’t know how to distract myself anymore.",23Nov2019,1
165,"I’ve been in such a fog lately that I’m not thinking clearly! Common sense has left the building for me! 

I quit my last job earlier this year, which was easy, paid well and my boss understood my anxiety/depression . I quit because he would tease me about my panic attacks and gave me less work than everyone else (which sounds cool right!?). It wasn’t. Because everyone started treating me like a mental case. 

So I’m living on my savings now. But when I get anxiety attacks, for some reason, buying something, *anything* online helps me calm down a bit.  So I’m slowly running low on my savings. I decided to post on Craigslist looking for a data entry job since usually Craigslist jobs are temporary and pay cash, in my past experience. I’ve found fast, temp warehouse or data entry jobs before and never had one bad experience with CL. I just need enough to make it till January since I do have a full time job lined up to start in late January. 

But I’m an idiot. I wasn’t thinking clearly, I’ve been in a depression haze for about a week. I just sleep and eat then go back to sleep. I live with a roommate who travels for work too so I haven’t spoken to a human person face to face in about a week. 

This morning I got an email with a link from someone claiming to be a manager and he sent a link to apply. I’m so excited because it was exactly what I was looking for! And as I’ve said, I’ve been hired before from CL from local small businesses who need seasonal work, like warehouses or data entry before my last full time job. So this wasn’t unusual so correspond via email. 

It was a page that asked for my name, number and address. General stuff about my last job, etc. It asks for a emergency number and I put my mom and my moms number. After I sent the information, I emailed the guy and told him I completed the application. So while I waited, I went back and looked at site so I could google the company name and realized it was a scammy site. I couldn’t find anything on the logo on the site. There was no company name. 

The person called me a little while later and I answered fully aware this was a scam, but I’m not good at thinking on my toes. So I tried to go along and had plans on calling him out. He said I needed to send a google play card  to verify 🙄  and I snapped. I started yelling I would find him and other really horrible things. I was so angry and hurt that I’m smarter than this. But my brain honestly feels like it’s on its lowest setting.  The guy laughed and said, “bitch I have all your information.” And hung up. 

This threw me into an anxiety frenzy. I’m so mad at myself. I love watching scam baiter YT videos, and I’m young so I should know better! But I haven’t slept well, then I sleep too much. I’ve only eaten junk food for 2 weeks straight not one fruit or vegetable cause I have no energy to go to the store. I just eat what’s here in my cabinet and it’s all junk food. 

Right now, I’m just hiding under my covers wondering what he’ll do with all my information:( I’m an idiot.",23Nov2019,1
166,"this is honestly the lowest i've ever been ever, and i don't even know why. like yesterday, i would wake up feeling normal and for a few hours, i feel happy. but then everything went to shit town and i dont even know what triggered it. all i know is that i felt suicidal ever since and the only thing stopping me from going through with my plan is the fear of the unknown.",23Nov2019,1

168,"I'm so fucking done. I've been really fucking anxious the whole day. I've got this friend, whom I love with all that I have. She's my world, right? And she understands how fucked my mentalhealth is. But... Sometimes... It's almost as if she doesn't care anymore? Like... I get really fucking anxious whenever I decide to ask her important questions, to which I get a reply to several hours later, or if we get into a small disagreement and she completely ignores me for several hours. It makes my anxiety go haywire and I can't think about anything else. She understands this since I've repeatedly explained this to her. And I always ask her if she's got a minute to actually answer these questions so that my anxiety doesn't fuck me up until I get an answer or whatever. But even though she knows this, she still doesn't answer because she's supposed to be with a friend or just forgot or whatever. It makes me feel fucking stupid for even trying to ask her, because I know what the result will be. She's the one friend that has simultaneously made feel really loved and connected, and sometimes, really alone.   

I've struggled with anxiety and depression for my entire life, and I've really never met anybody that has experienced life in the same fucked way that I have, until I met her. I don't know... I just felt like I needed to rant a bit.",23Nov2019,1

I also want to teach people without mental health about the topic. I have so many projects and ideas to do and I just don't know what to do currently.

170,"I'm not sure if this is the correct place to post this, so if not please let me know (and possibly suggest the correct place to go, I'm not that familiar with reddit)

I'm under a lot of stress and pressure at the moment and numerous things have knocked me down at once including; family, work, stress of trying to get a new job and a friend being really shitty. my mental health had never been the best but all these things have gotten on me at once so I just need to vent a little

Family - My family are a little special, they're not ones for sympathy and every time I've tried to go to them about stress of a problem you either get them singing let it go from frozen, or you get them screaming that you stop being a little bitch about the problem so they always manage to make stress worse, especially when they constantly bring up all my past faults and failures,  also mentioning that I'll never actually amount to anything in life or the ever classic you'll never own your own home, you'll live with us \[my parents\] forever

Work - I work for some horrible people, they never care about staff and the company motto is honestly so close to being ""work sets you free"", I cover so many people at work, I practically do the jobs of about 4 people but I'm paid minimum wage, the only thing they are good at is destroying my self confidence and make me fall into a deeper depression

stress at finding a new job - I've been trying to get my dream as of late, it requires tests and MANY interviews. I keep on running into the same problem though, my family, every time I open a text book my family keep screaming that I'll never actually get this job, I'll never pass the tests, they'd never accept anyone like myself

friends - I've never been one for making friends, never had any self confidence in myself and I'm going to guess that just radiates off of me, but a few months ago I met someone whilst I was at a gaming convention whilst abroad and we talked constantly, pretty much everyday (even when I went back to my respective country) for a minimum of 4 hours a weekday (7-8 hours minimum on weekends) and it was really nice (they even waited up till stupid o'clock so they could call me as soon as I woke up and i even wrote them  poem in their birthday card, and I failed English at school, so that's saying something), finally having someone in my life to talk with, someone to share experiences with and talk about my interests. From there we came up with the master plan that we see each other again, so we talked about locations and all the nice things we could do at said locations, them constantly saying that i'm their best friend and i' so important too them, so we finally decided on one, and over Christmas too, so i booked flights, paid for a really nice air BnB so I could cook us Christmas dinner, and then nothing, they went back to college, and just completely ghosted me, it's now been 4 months since we've spoken, with 2 passive texts with half heart'ed messages that they're coming. It's at the back of my mind that if they really cared they'ed at least try and message me, hell once a week, but I get nothing. It was only as of late I really only realised that I actually started falling for my friend, wanting us to be more than friends, and i started to open my heart again, but as it always happens, I open my heart and that's when people leave my life again. yet again my family rear their heads in also constantly pointing out that my friend isn't coming and I've wasted all my money again

It's just getting to the point where I can't take it anymore, they've actually managed to ruin my holidays, as I should hopefully be going away with my friend (I'm trying to keep my hopes up) and I should be going to Orlando in January in the new year for my birthday, but my family can't help themselves in ruining the things I like, as they can't help but point out that as always I go to these places alone, like all my holidays.

So I'm posting here as a means to Express myself or to just try to vent out these feelings I've had trapped with no one to talk to about it or maybe this is desperation, I honestly dont know at this point..

172,My whole life I've been a loner but here lately I've been wanting to be a social person but why? What's the benefit? I'm selfish. I want to know what I'll be getting. In my opinion people aren't worth knowing. We're all selfish and sloppy and rude and everyone is out for themselves. I tried to be social the other day but now I'm like fuck that. And also I'm going to be confident in my lonesomeness. Fuck feelin bad for myself for being who I am. I'm a loner. Always have been.

173,"I don't know if this is something I can talk about but this last week I've spent very little time working on school things to give my mind a bit more rest. But all I do is literally nothing useful like gaming, watching videos on youtube or listening to music and it doesn't feel right to give up valuable school time for that. I do nothing to actually make my situation better because for the time being, I believe there *is* nothing I can do but wait. I've been on the waiting list for public mental healthcare since July and I should be seeing a therapist right after the christmas break. So I'm just waiting for that because at the moment the thought of anything that can drag me out fills me with dread. The one upside is that I try to keep as much of my normal habits going but for the first time in my life, even that is becoming hard. I have been showing up to all my classes this past week but when the trains didn't run on friday I didn't hesitate to stay at home and not give a fuck anymore about the class that I missed (even though it was kinda important). All I'm doing is just staying in bed, mostly fantasizing about a better world because that's the only thing I feel good about doing. Now I'm gonna end up missing all my deadlines for this quarter because of it and I get even more stressed. It certainly doesn't help that I'm not working on something I'm genuinely passionate about at school, so I feel literally zero obligations to myself to finish this other than ""getting any degree at all"" and ""the faster you are done, the earlier you can go focus on what you genuinely care about and the less it'll cost."" But I really went on a tangent there. I just don't know what to do when I'm taking days off so that I don't feel like total shit. I mean, even things I've been wanting to do for a long time like getting better shoes and clothes for the winter because I'm always cold and I haven't had a new look in at least 1.5 years now, aren't things I want to do when I'm ready to go do it. Or even just buying better shampoo because the one I have now sucks. That's genuinely caring for myself but I'm just anxious about it and I retreat back to the comfort of music. So what, do I just... sit here and do nothing until jan 6? Is my life that sad? I hate this...",23Nov2019,1
174,I’ve been struggling with a lot of things for a long time and I finally was able to get diagnosis for my ADHD and apparently also an early onset persistent depressive disorder with intermittent major episodes.
