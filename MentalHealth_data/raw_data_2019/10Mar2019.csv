Hi everyone!

Here are the questions:

1) How did you guys know there was something not right?  What did make you ask for help? 

2) How did you explain what's going on in your mind in your first appointment /session ?
Did you just say how you feel about certain things? How you're living every day? 

3) I think a lot of people google their symptoms and make assumptions based on what they read. 
Most of the time, the symptoms overlap and so you can't really know what's going on. 
My question is do you tell your dr/ therapist if you are suspecting that you have something because that's what you read online and fitted with your situation? Or do you not mention it?  I am concerned that if I say what I think I have, I won't be taken seriously because the only resource I used was google. 

Thank you in advance!",10Mar2019,1

I am in therapy but my psychiatrist isn’t helping at all (he cant really handle the situation) and I don’t dare to tell my parents (I’m 16) what can I do? Do I have depression and do I have to learn to live with this feeling that I’ll never be happy?",10Mar2019,3

6,"I am terrified to talk about my mental health with anyone. It started with an ex; I was going through something and when I decided to talk about it with them I was met with hostility, and everything fell apart. I didn't hold them responsible for my emotions or expect them to fix everything for me, I just wanted someone to understand you know? They didn't, and I don't know how or why this affected me so deeply, but ever since then I've been terrified to open myself up to people. 
Friends, family, work acquaintances, partners, it's all the same, I just can not seem to bring myself to tell people what I might be going through and be honest with my emotions the way I used to, I don't know how to fix this. 
I have come a very long way from where I started, my SO knows more about me than anyone else ever has, but in spite of knowing they would never try to hurt me or be anything but understanding/supportive at what I have to say, there are still some things I'm scared I could never open up about. 
I seem to have these random unexplainable lapses in okayness and it makes me half a person, insecure and self destructive, and while I do my best to never act on the negative emotions the spiral brings, it still affects my relationships with people; then because I have this crippling fear of even saying a word about it if I even try to open up my mind will draw blanks and I can't explain why I'm feeling what I'm feeling to anybody. 
It makes me feel like my emotions are completely invalid that I can't even explain what I'm feeling or why I'm feeling it. Getting to know people and making friends is really hard, because one day I'll be this really likeable, cool, outgoing, charismatic person who has a lot to offer, then the next I'm this slow, nervy, stuttering shell who gets emotionally exhausted just trying to maintain small talk 
By nature I'm an optimist, and a very big believer in self evolution, deep down I believe this will be okay in the end, I just cannot for the life of me figure out how to fix this so I can feel whole, and be transparent for my SO and everyone else who cares about me",10Mar2019,3
7,"Both of my parents are diagnosed with ADHD and I’m almost 100% sure that I have rather severe ADHD or ADD. I’d be more apt to believe that I have ADD, because I have the worst attention span of any person I’ve ever known. I suck at paying attention, zone out of anything and everything to the point that it frustrates my boyfriend and probably impedes my work flow at work because I can’t ever take instructions properly. 

I often over-react and overthink things to the point of depressing myself and making myself anxious. I’m impulsive and can’t stick to one hobby and I forget everything. I can’t even go shopping properly with my boyfriend because by the time I get into the store I’d rather stare into space then conclude that I’m done and want to leave rather than face the daunting task of digging through clothes to find something I like. I could have a single person at work order and then right after their order completely forget everything they said and have to re-ask them what they want. I’m always losing things. Luckily, I do identify with the while ‘hyper focus’ thing that so many forums talk about, so once I’m in the flow of something at work (meaning we’re crowded) I’m pretty much the best cashier a person could have. However, when I’m like this I can’t have anybody talk to me, touch me, or bother my fucking cash register or I’ll quickly become overwhelmed and feel like curling up into a ball and crying. Times when I’m in this state are pretty much the only times I get aggressive with other people. I could go on and on about frustrations about myself that I’m finally connecting to possibly having ADHD. 

The thing is, when I talk to my mom about it her conclusion is ‘oh. You definitely have it, your dad and I both do’ and last time I talked about wanting to seek treatment, they acted frustrated with me. They always question whether I ‘need’ to go to the doctor for anything anyway, so their reactions make me hesitant to talk to a doctor. Of course, I’ve also been told to be careful talking to therapists because maybe I won’t be able to get a gun in the future so there’s that -insert eye roll here-. I am an adult now, which makes it ultimately my decision, but I keep questioning my judgement. What if I’m overreacting?

One other thing I’m concerned about is that I’ve been like this my whole life. What if I do end up getting treated and then once my mind is even a little clearer that I won’t be the sweet, energetic little fucker that everyone I know knows? I’m scared that feeling better will mean that I won’t be myself anymore and that I’ll have to get to know this whole new mindset I’ll have and that makes me anxious. I don’t really know how to proceed with this.",10Mar2019,1

10,"Since i was 19, I've struggled with depression and anxiety (I'm turning 26 in a few months). It's been pretty extreme at times--I won't go into it much for the sake of this post--and I feel like it's been a pretty constant struggle since then.  

I've had trauma, but not as bad as some people. But is it possible that trauma, depression, and anxiety can cause memory loss? 

I was re-reading an email I sent to a friend of mine when I was 19, and I told him in the email that I couldn't remember much of what happened that previous year. 

We actually have a really long string of emails from that time--something I have ZERO recollection of. I was actually really shocked to read them. I can also barely remember what college was like, and I find myself mixing up events and times when I try to recall it. And it's a short-term issue too. I can't remember things that my boss mentioned last week, or things we had long conversations about, so I have to write everything down or I won't remember. 

But if in fact that all of this crap has caused some kind of memory loss, is there any way to get it back or at least improve this condition? 

It's probably a stupid question, but now I'm kind of freaking out about it. What else have I forgotten?

Trigger warning! 

I was assaulted when I was 19, and I don't remember a lot of that. I don't know what day it was, or even what month. But I thought that was because I was intoxicated when it happened, and that I tried really, really hard to forget it afterwards. 

Honestly, I'm just so freaked out by all of this. Has this happened to anyone else???",10Mar2019,2
11,"My boyfriend’s mother died about 4 months ago. I was there for him through that but also struggled with grieving as she was a second mother to me. The reason he did this is because he is grieving and he doesn’t  have enough emotional support to take care of me the way I deserve AND take care of himself right now.  When I ask him if this can be treated as a break other than a break up, he doesn’t have an answer, which I’m still trying to understand, especially since we still both love each other very much. I’m hoping that giving him space and time to grow will heal us as well so we can continue working on the relationship we had, because it was a very good one. 

I don’t understand. It hasn’t really gotten easier even though it’s been almost a week. We are on spring break now and it’s actually really hard not to contact him, even though we did end on good terms and are still friends. 

The reason I’m hurting is because I feel like this is my fault. If I weren’t so mentally ill and physically sick at the time, maybe this wouldn’t have happened. Maybe if I weren’t depressed and anxious all of the time, he wouldn’t have done this. It’s so hard not to blame myself. I don’t know how to get through this so please be gentle and kind. This wound is still very much so open and my depression is kicking my butt. I’m not able to do much of anything right now. 

This isn’t a “delete everything and block him on Facebook” kind of break up, so I’m struggling with why he doesn’t have a clear answer right now. I promised I wouldn’t ask him for some time, just to let this pass. How do I cope? Is it stupid of me to hope this relationship could re-mend? What can I do to take care of me now and show him that I can be strong but still be there for him? Is this just a matter that can be fixed with time?

12,"So, I'm diagnosed with c-ptsd from familial physical and psychological abuse and bullying, etc.  I'm a male. On a sidenote, I have a large rotund buttocks and when I walk my hips sway (typical of a womens along with a somewhat minor case of gasto or male breasts). I have been teased since early elementary for these physical features of being homosexual. I have never fancied a guy but do enjoy the aesthetic of certain men. I was just pondering the notion that maybe I like the aesthetic of a fit guy because I want to have dominant physical and personality features; and it's some sort of transference that I'm experiencing. I'm also on the less endowed side and tend too quickly glance at their crotch area. I haven't had a thoroughly piv sexual experience with a woman whilst sober. Also, I consider myself sapio/demi-sexual and am somewhat introverted and socially clumsy so, it's awkward, amongst other things to meet women. Also, my father was absent; so, this may also play a factor. Alot of variables here and I know the obvious answer is just to sexually experiment; but, I'm curious as to the insights of others in this forum. ",10Mar2019,1
13,"So phobias are pretty common right? Everyone has something, something that makes them loose it. 

Usually its harmless and avoidable things. 

For me it's a social health issue. 

I am terrified of shots and needles. I have phantom pain in my left arm as I write this. Hours of therapy hasn't changed a thing. 

It originates from 2009/2010 where we got a special type of flu shot in school. I was around nine at the time. My classmate was a little scared and it transmitted to me. Being nine years old and a bit nervous (which turned into unwillingness) they shoved in a chair, someone held me really hard while I kicked and cried to get loose and the nurse leant in and sat the needle in  my arm. Needless to say it was pretty traumatic

Wow I'm actually having some brutal pains and anxiety right now. 

Anyway that's the last time I ever took a shot. I don't have the last dosage of tetanus and MMR. I have no protection against HPV. 

I've always felt safe, knowing herd immunity will protect me enough. But with the growing anti-vacc community I'm started to get scared. Like, I could catch something serious. Everyone around me is vaccinated and I barley go anywhere (and if I do I overuse hand disinfection)  as I study from home and dont really have friends  

I also am very pro-vaxx and will be the first to defend vaccines. 

My phobia of needles just ruins it all. In reality I need to leave blood samples as well (I might have issues with my metabolism) but I have panic attacks and I will get violent if triggeted enough. 

Does this make a me a danger to society? I guess it does. But despite countless hours of therapy it's terrifying and I don't know what to do. ",10Mar2019,2
15,"My fiancé was admitted to the inpatient program at my local hospital last night, this is her 4th admission but the first one since I have known her and while I have known her she was always a super happy woman.

17,"I legit can remember people’s name, faces and whatever I hear. Sometimes I to limited study because I already retain information from classes when teachers are speaking but I just can’t remember numbers! 
In history I would remember the details or event, who took place but I just struggle in remembering the date and time.. at all! I believe if my birthday aren’t associated to a holiday, I would forget it. I struggled remembering the timetable, but I ended up remembering it regardless because I found there’s a pattern in the timetable (like if I remember one set I can remember the other, i.e. 2x3 is the same as 3x2 and I found patterns in numbers such as 9 time table the first number of the pair goes up while the other go down since I was 6!) 
This sounds very condescending but I believe my brain is able to remember patterns and learning it hence my ability my mathematics. Even though I struggle remembering numbers, I actually exceed in maths because the formulas are letters to represent a number. But I don’t think I’m a lost cause because I do remember important dates if reminded (of course) and I remember even numbers easily or if the numbers are repeated

18,"Basically I keep feeling sick everyday and it’s getting worse. It started about three weeks ago when I was at my friends house I ended up feeling sick and was really close to throwing up but I managed to stop myself. I wasn’t anxious that night I had just ate way too much but I’ve always had a bit of a fear of being sick. 

The next weekend I went out to lunch with my girlfriend and I ended up feeling really sick after it but it was different to the usual feeling. It was the first time we went out so I had been nervous and lost my appetite and I felt really nauseous. 

Then a few days ago I had an event on at my school and I went with my mum and we went to a presentation in a classroom and it was really warm and crammed and I thought “it would be really bad if I ended up feeling sick” and then I started to feel sick and then my heart started beating rapidly. Then I couldn’t breathe properly and I was worried that people could tell because only one person was talking and that was the teacher doing the presentation. So I was really worried I was about to be sick and twenty minutes later I still felt the same but it was getting worse. My arms started to get tingly and then it went to my hands and it’s hard to describe it’s like the worst pins and needles I’ve ever had. I thought I was about to pass out so I had to leave the presentation. I felt fine after a couple minutes but I didn’t go back in. I’m not sure but I think it might have been a panic attack. 

Every time I’ve went out since then I keep feeling sick but I think it’s because I’m worried about feeling sick that it actually makes me feel sick. 

Then today my girlfriend was coming over to my house and she wanted me to come and meet her parents when they dropped her off so this morning before she arrived I was starting to feel anxious and my dad gave me a bowl of spaghetti hoops and I could only manage to eat half of it because I thought I was going to throw up. After that everything was fine until tonight when I went out with my friends. We went to the cinema and then McDonald’s after it and I was really hungry because I had barely eaten anything all day but when we got to McDonald’s I started to feel really sick and I was worried I’d end up being sick over my friends. I could barely eat any of my food and now every time I go out to eat I just end up feeling sick.

I’m really not sure what this is and I’m not diagnosed with anything but some of my friends have told me they think I have anxiety and I’m almost certain I have OCD. I just want to know what I can do to get rid of this and what it might be and what’s causing it.

20,"Before I get into this, I want to clarify that obviously in an ideal world, everyone could go to therapy because everyone could benefit from it. I know that already.

That said, this questions is being asked with the context that the psychological services in my area are already very busy, and from what I’ve heard they’ve had to turn away people in the past after only one or two sessions because they didn’t have the resources or manpower.

Because of this, I figure it’s safe to say that it’s most important for people who are very high priority to get therapy whereas people whose issues are less severe shouldn’t overflood the services (at least as long as they lack the resources to accommodate everyone).

So, with that in mind, where do you think it’s fair to draw the line between when someone _needs_ to get therapy vs when it’s probably okay if they don’t?

Because I’ve been thinking about going to therapy on/off for years but haven’t done it because I don’t feel like my problems are as severe as the people who _should_ be going to therapy. But there are also times when that reasoning seems less valid.

Idk. I also don’t want to invest hundreds of bucks in intake sessions and whatnot just to be told they can’t help me. I can’t afford to spend that kind of money without an ROI, so if it’s fair to say that I _don’t_ need therapy, then I probably shouldn’t.",10Mar2019,1
21,"I’m a person living with bipolar and I’ve been psychotic and previously was put in mental institutions three times in two months. I was no danger to myself or anyone else although I did feel invincible so I can’t say for certain that had I continued to remain psychotic that I wouldn’t have thought I could fly or something at some point. 

With that said I have also had a banner recovery. I started a business, bought a house, paid off all my debt all within three years. I take my medications and go to therapy and I even spoke at the National Alliance for mental illness’ nationwide confrence and led support groups for a year. I am now a mental health advocate though my stances on most issues are nuanced due to the amount of things to take into consideration. 

So I can see all sides but I think who we should really be asking about legislation are... well people like me. Who can see the many sides and speak from the perspective of being psychotic and wanting to stay that way, and also speak from the perspective of sometime who was involuntarily committed and ultimately got better because of it.  

This isn’t a one size fits all issue and all cases are so unique that there should be people that have been in my shoes making these decisions. I hate to say it but you normies that haven’t had to strip and shower bare naked in front of a mental health nurse, or haven’t seen the the look in the eyes of your father as he commits you to a psychiatric facility and leaves you sobbing in a hospital, and you haven’t thought you immaculately conceived the second coming of Christ....and then after all that came back only to thrive more in life after all that— if you haven’t been there or somewhere close, you shouldn’t be able to tell me what to do with my body or brain or treatment. 

Because you don’t know. You don’t know the suffering that takes place and the toll it takes on your spirit to go to a treatment facility. And the shame. And embarrassment. And fear. And loneliness. And you don’t know what it’s like to have to learn to retrust your brain after it lies to you. It’s like mentally learning to walk again. How can I trust that the sky is actually blue if my brain said yesterday that I know like I know like I know that it’s green. 

So yea, get a collection of people living in recovery from mental illness to make these decisions. That’s your best way to make sure we take time and care and consideration with this. 

If anyone knows any other ways I can talk to legislators or people crafting bills on these issues let me know. I won’t know about all of them in all states but I’d love to share my experiences to help give texture to this issue. ",10Mar2019,6
22,"Hi, I have a couple questions, any help would be appreciated! (Also I’m on mobile and can’t figure out how to make paragraphs :/) 

This is extremely long, I’m sorry. I haven’t written all this out at all before. So the TL;DR: I have 2 questions. 1. Could my change in diet that strikingly coincides with my dramatic increase in depression have caused it? (I went gluten free because of stomach issues) And 2. I feel like my brain is emotionally not functioning properly and would like to see if anyone knows what is going on. It feels like a source of good feelings in this other world in my head that I sometimes desperately want, and manifests as latching onto people HARD, wanting to do something stupid for the rush, or just me tripping out on this other world feeling.

So I’m already diagnosed with depression/anxiety. These past couple months I’ve been suicidal often. I’ve had depression for a long time, and been treated for it, but it feels like around late January a switch was flipped for major, crippling depression. A few things happened around then, and I’m wondering if they were a trigger. First, medicine change: I was on both Welbutrin and Buspar from Nov-early Feb, when I stopped buspar because it was making anxiety worse. Tried Lamictal and immediately had warning signs of a serious reaction, so I quit that. My doctor recommended I not take any other medicine for a week. My anxiety improved tremendously, but whatever new depression was already there intensified a lot. Since then, I have new medicine to try; not sure if it’s having positive effects yet. Second: dietary changes. The major depressive episodes coincide almost perfectly with the diet changes I’ve made. Since October I’ve been having bad stomach pains and nausea, causing me to miss work and school. Blood/stool tests didn’t show anything, and an ultrasound and endoscopy came back normal. So, I decided to try testing myself for food allergies. I went gluten free late Jan/beginning of Feb. At the end of Feb, my doctor recommended a low FODMAP diet (kinda complicated- no gluten, lactose, high fructose corn syrup, soy, and more; basically more complex molecules that are hard for the small intestine to digest). The depression has been gradually worse. The third and fourth things are factors I’m sure, but I’ll provide them for info. Third: increasing life stresses. There have been so many things to deal with, and they’ve just been adding up. My husband has an undiagnosed somewhat serious condition that he’s been struggling with for two years; after the endoscopy in early Jan, we got stuck with a huge medical bill, and we won’t be able to make it through this semester without borrowing money from the in laws; had a big falling out with family late last summer and haven’t spoken to half of them since (I’m also not allowed back home)- actually this one’s more important, they laid hands on my brother before kicking him out, and I called the police, this coming to a head after an emotionally abusive childhood with threat of violence; difficulty with school; needing to step down from an officer position of a club that I was proud of, for reasons I won’t get into; I’ve been non stop working part time and studying; my husband and I have been going through a pretty rough patch, and marriage counseling to try and help it; and I hadn’t had many friends to hang out with or talk to. So environmental factors definitely played a part IMO. Fourth: Faith has been incredibly important to me and is how I self medicated my undiagnosed depression through high school with a shitty family situation. I base my beliefs in it and find reasons to live from my faith. But I lately I’ve been questioning what’s true and I feel betrayed. Without that, my firm reasons for living weren’t there. And fifth: I think there’s something else emotionally wrong with my brain. This is really what I want to get into. Idk if it came as a coping skill growing up or what, but I have this- pool, I guess- of emotion that seems to exist in some other world in my head. Maybe a way to best describe it is that it feels like I have a demon parasite in my brain (I do not think this literally). It sometimes presents itself as temptation to do something stupid. But it mostly exists as an escape realm inside my head. Just an entirely different world. I’ll still be seeing the outside world, but it feels like I’m on drugs or something (I have not done drugs and can’t confirm this). It makes me want to go somewhere _else_, do something _else_.  I’ve had issues with driving recklessly in the past, because it’s a euphoric sensation that tempts me, that accesses that other world. Music can be a trigger, too. It’s not just feeling good, though, because if I really let it, it could convince me to give up everything I know in my life and go somewhere _else_. I don’t know what that would be, except that suicide fits that description. This euphoria has manifested itself in relationships; I’ll cling onto a friend in ways I would describe as more intimate mentally than with a spouse (and more than is healthy). Just absolutely latch on, because they made me feel good and I WANT it. Like they accessed that world and now I think about them all the time and when I’m with them, I’m in that world again. It’s so euphoric. But it’s also exhausting. It’s just completely and absolutely draining (which I feel like makes sense in the physical aspect of the brain and chemicals and stuff?). Friends that I’ve latched onto like this, when I’m “sober”, I realize of course that it’s bad for both of us, but also, I don’t want to be around them because I’m ashamed and weirded out by whatever this feeling is. In high school I latched onto this guy who seemed also to be struggling. Thought about him every second of every day &amp; went out with him, then cut it off abruptly after seeing how unhealthy that was. Went the next few months feeling absolutely apathetic because I still couldn’t stop thinking about him. So this whole emotional issue altogether is just... bad. I’ve succeeded in suppressing it and functioning normally for at least three years. But when things get bad, I can’t. I WANT the good feelings. 

So, two questions: first, could the diet change have affected/helped trigger significantly increased depression (I did this before changing medicine), and could there be something causing both stomach issues and mental issues? Second: does anyone know what the hell is going on with this emotional train wreck?? I feel absolutely alone and crazy and like shit in general.",10Mar2019,1
23,"This topic has to do with mental health because I let something that only existed outside my circle of influence bother me where my behavior was troubling, but then through a series of events, I not only got over it, but also turned my life around and kept my career when I started performing way better in my career.

I am a Disney fan and a fan of family films, like Home Alone, made by 20th Century Fox. I am also a special case because my mind is like a steep trap, and remembers dates very well. This is all part of what makes me do very well in my career and is a natural part of my autism. However, the problems started when on November 6, 2017, Disney proposed buying 20th Century Fox. I took this as a move of monopolistic practices, and more becoming of a dictator, because as a Disney fan I know almost every single thing Disney has bought over the past 20 years. This started pumping up the anxiety in my head. Violent thoughts, extreme dark scenarios, popping up in my head. It was hard for me to work because of this. On December 14, 2017, Disney bought 20th Century Fox. I felt sunk, defeated, couldn't even feel happy or excited. It was Christmas. I couldn't even feel happy or excited when I had my company's annual Christmas party. I couldn't even feel happy or excited when I went to see Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi that night. The situation was made worse when I felt the bad guys won in that movie, and when I discovered the backlash against it, and when I realized we no longer had Carrie Fisher or Debbie Reynolds. I felt just sick to my stomach, achy, loss of enthusiasm. The big breaker was some guy on Twitter named Mathew Buck, who goes by Film Brain, and does film reviews for Channel Awesome (Nostalgia Critic's site), declaring on Twitter that Fox was effectively dead and that it would be destroyed under Disney, loss of a Hollywood legacy, things like that. Unfortunately, at that time, I was a guy who would believe anything people would say online or in the news. 

2018 came and I felt worried about the state of film making. However, I don't work in the film industry. I work as a software engineer at a large retail corporation. You would think I would be worried about 20th Century Fox, but then the biggest problem arose. My manager gave me some rough constructive criticism, said she felt like I was the weakest member of her team, and that I was performing like an intern a year after I first started. I called Dad and I was to the point of tears telling him about my problem. I didn't take it with a grain of salt. I took it with a sledgehammer to the gut. The problem was not Disney and 20th Century Fox coming together. The problem was me. I was making this happen to myself. So I did what any man would do when he's in a situation like this. Cried out to God for help to turn my life around. I already am an avid Christ follower, and have been for 17 1/2 years. I just cry out to God more when I'm in a crisis in my life.

Dad and I worked out a plan to help me get better at doing my job and to stop performing like an intern out of college. I knew I just had to implement those strategies. I had a month to do so, otherwise they would transfer me to a different department. I felt bad too when I got my annual review from my boss. Nevertheless, I still persisted on implementing those strategies. When my boss was promoted to director of the team, and one of my coworkers was promoted to manager, I believed that things would change for the better, even though I was not out of the woods yet. The day of my next one on one with the managing director came on April 27, 2018, the very day Avengers: Infinity War stormed into theaters. I came in there fearing the worst, ready to tell her about the strategies that I have been implementing. That's when things started to change for the better. She said that she liked the strategies I have been implementing, and that she has noticed a change in the way I do my job. From that point I started a turn around.

The rest of 2018 passes quickly. I stuck with the same job, and found out that a new holding company called ""New Disney"" would be created, becoming the parent of both Disney and 20th Century Fox. Another article early in 2019 stated that it would be business as usual. Also, I got an answer on Quora saying that while 20th Century Fox will be owned by ""New Disney"" or The Walt Disney Company, they will continue to operate in the same way that they did before the acquisition. I also started doing speeches at various venues talking about my progression as an autistic person. I also had my pay increased because HR wanted the IT department to be competitive with other IT departments. The biggest change is that I am more confident, and that I have not hit myself since Christmas Day 2018. Don't ask why it happened, but I did, and in the time span of a year, I was able to do a complete turnaround of my life.

Now whenever some news outlet says that 20th Century Fox is dead, I want to pop up through the screen, breaking the fourth wall, and telling them that they're lying. I know I can't even do that because it's not possible, except in cartoons. What is happening though, is that I'm applying more critical thinking to the situation. This has started happening to me more in the past year. I'm finding out that a lot of the stuff put out on the Internet just isn't really true. More often than not, they're opinions, thoughts, and most likely trolls. Even the trusted news outlets have to put in something called Op-Ed to warn readers that what they are reading isn't going to be 100% true. My misguided belief in everything bad that the Internet has spewed out for the longest time has messed up my behavior and mental health, but now everything is starting to turn around. 2019 looks to be like my year.

Looking back, me being affected and heavily troubled by the news that Disney would be buying 20th Century Fox, may have been the best thing that ever happened to me.

24,"Hi everyone. I’m new to reddit so hopefully I don’t do a bunch of stuff wrong... if I do just let me know and I will try to correct it for future posts.

Anyway, I have been dealing with depression for about 13 years now. I’d say that in the past 4 years or so, it’s been pretty extreme. I have noticed more and more that I am beginning to get physically ill during times of high stress or times of especially strong depression.

The symptoms are severe stomach pain (sometimes to the point of crying or having a hard time breathing), migraines, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea for days at a time, dizziness, etc. Eczema also erupts all over my ENTIRE body and face.

I was CERTAIN that something was wrong with my stomach or gallbladder because it started to become a constant issue. I found myself getting sick at work and feeling miserable at home or spending most of my evening in the bathroom.

After seeing two doctors and running a ton of tests, they both came to the conclusion that my symptoms were mental health related. I explained that my symptoms were so real and caused me physical problems and pains, they couldn’t just be inside my head. But both doctors told me that depressed patients often have real, physical health manifestations of their mental health problems.

I am just wondering if any of you have experienced this, and if so, what were your symptoms and how did you cope?

I got put on Prozac a few months ago and although I generally feel much better, whenever stress comes around all the same symptoms rear back up. I am working out, reading, journaling, practicing meditation and yoga. Unfortunately nothing has helped all of these physical problems. So any input you have is helpful!",10Mar2019,1
25,"First time posting here, I'm 16 btw, I came here to seek help I guess. Before I state how I feel I'd like to say It's hard to put into words because I don't completely understand it myself. Also this might be pretty long. 

I'd like to start off by saying I was a pretty sensitive kid. Anytime someone said something slightly negative it destroyed me. Around 7th/8th grade I fell into a deep hole. I was depressed for a while. Freshman year of high school things took a turn for the better but long story short I'm back in that hole.

Whenever I'm with anyone I feel so out of place, I feel like I don't belong, I feel no one wants me there, and I contribute nothing. I shrugged it off but I started feeling this way towards my family and close friends too. I don't know, every day is just.. a day nothing more nothing less. I don't think of what I'll do that day I kind of just exist from day to day doing practically nothing. I have to go to school but at school it's nothing more than eight hours of fuzz. I get home and smoke until I sleep.

Up until the smoking part that's how it feels when I'm sober.

Here's the drugs use part. I knew before I ever tried drugs that I would get psychologically addicted, I knew for 100% certain if I tried drugs I wouldn't quit, and I was right. I started smoking weed about 6 months ago since then I've done other drugs but that doesn't quite matter right now. My point is I have a very addictive personality and I know that but O can't change it. I've been thinking about my drug use and I wanted to think how far I would go. Now I have never tried cocaine or heroine or meth or anything crazy like that but I can tell you for certain if it was in my hands I would 98% probably do it and I will most likely use these substances in the future.

The point of this was I started using drugs to cope and at this point I don't think they help. Before you start giving some motivational speech in the comment section telling me to seek help or quit, for that to work I'd have to want to change. I don't want to change but I don't wanna stay on this state either. This is the truth, and this is gonna sound awful and Ik it does but it's like there's two different fucking people in my head, but the truth is I want to try meth, I want to snort cocaine, not because everyone else  is doing it or some bullshit like that but because I need something more. I'm not sure about heroine still but that's the truth. I know pathetic right.

Now before you say ""Ah you feel this way because your drug abuse"" I felt this way before my drug abuse now I'm sure it's not helping but still. I don't know what's wrong with me I seriously feel like there's something not right I mean I have friends, I'm a functional member of society, I talk to my family but it always just feels mandatory like it's supposed to be there. That probably doesn't make sense. I don't know what's wrong but it feels just empty all the time and I don't know why. I just feel empty.  I'm only contempt when I'm sleeping. On top of this I feel like a disappointment and I just don't wanna go on. I don't think I wanna die or anything but there always seems like there's something missing. It's just torment in my head u know like this is some edgy shit but it's like every fucking time I just can't I can't. Or maybe I'm feeling too much all at once idk I'm just so frustrated with this shit. Idk what 
The fuck is wrong with my head my fucking head. Anyway thanks that's all.

26,"I'm currently 14, turning 15 on the 22nd :D. Anyways, back in 6th grade ADD really started taking affect and I started getting scary amounts of anxiety from my math teacher and stopped turning in work. She kept me in for recess for 3 quarters of the school year and my mom panicked cause of my tanked math grade so she threw me in special ed. I didn't think of it too much till 7th grade. What happened was that my band teacher accidentally called me Eddy (my name is Donny Edwards) and everyone started calling me ""special eddy"". It made my anxiety far worse than what it was before cause the whole school (7th grade and up)  was in on it. Hell, I was blackmailed and a whole bunch of fucked up shit like people made messenger groups and kept calling me but kicked me from the group so I couldn't answer, even sexually assaulted for a quick laugh. I hated that special ed room, the fact I was getting the same resources as people who were learning adjectives while I was above a 12th grade reading level *insert an r/iamverysmart joke*. I was watched constantly and the aides were always on my ass in front of everyone about work and shit and it got to me to where I tried killing myself. They're still on my ass to this day and I'm a freshman, still anxious to the point where I actually physically freeze, my ADD daydreams make me scared, schizophrenia type of things.

27,"Trigger warning: molestation

This is going to be a long post and I will be sharing things I thought I'd be taking to the grave so buckle up. This will also be a bit of a rant 

I am a 28 year old male who has had every serious relationship end the exact same way. I assumed my past had cursed me to relive the same cycle over and over as a punishment for my actions. I don't know if I subconsciously seek out women with issues or just unlucky. I have never listened to red flags and always try to help them with their problems and it seems that as soon as I do they leave me for another guy and realize I'm not worth their time anymore. 

My last relationship ended this past week in the same fashion buy it's only after some serious reflection that all of my relationships not because I'm not good enough but because I have control issues and in trying to control things I disagree with i actually end up pushing them away. 

Up until this weekend I was unaware of these issues existing. No one had ever pointed them out  to me that I can recall. That led me to read dozens of articles on control issues and how to deal with them. I got many great starting points for helping me and made an appointment at the mental health department for some professional help as well.

All of the articles mentioned things from your past resulting in the control issues so I began reflecting on my skeletons and think I understand why I have most of my issues but hopefully the professionals will be able to help me unlock more and give me treatment options to deal with them. 

I had an unsupportive father who was never really present and an older brother who required all the attention which my mother provided leaving me to keep myself entertained for the most part. Growing up I never really felt accepted or loved by my father and I could never really do anything right it seemed. The only thing I could do right was my schooling. Either by my upbringing or luck I was good in school excelling in my studies. I think because it was the only thing I could control at the time. Growing up there was always a lot of sexual talk in my household from my father that I feel was inappropriate for kids to hear about their parents. Fast forward to my teenage years with the start of puberty, I never got ""the talk"" or had proper role models on what was acceptable. Even typing this out I'm hesitating but here it goes. I molested two of my cousins at different times of my life. One was only once during Thanksgiving and I touched her inappropriately while she slept or so I thought. The other was a more frequent thing happening roughly 6 times over the course of a year or so. I also touched her inappropriately but in both cases nothing explicitly sexual took place it could be compared to moderate petting. After I realized what I had done a severe level of self hatred and shame overtook me. I allowed my urges to control me and my hatred and shame made it so I never wanted to allow myself to lose control again. At least that's what I'm thinking happened. 

I morally opposed everything that allowed people to lose control, and up until now couldn't provide a logical reason as to why I felt that way. That included all drugs and alcohol for the most part as well. 

My brother got married and has 3 beautiful kids that I spend no time with even though they are withing a 2 minute drive from my house. I initially thought it was just because my brother was an asshole my whole life but really it was a defense mechanism because it was becoming harder to keep my secret. I subconsciously knew that if I was close to my nieces and nephews and the secret came out and I wasn't allowed to see them anymore it would kill me. 

I reached out to both of my cousins and apologized for what I did and explained the situation making sure I let them know it was absolutely not their fault in anyway and solely my own. I also took this time to tell my mom what I did and expected to be shunned for it and I was pleasantly surprised that she understood and accepted me for it. She told me to forgive myself for it and move on but I feel like I can't do that if what I did was still effecting my cousins at all. 

I'm losing my train of thought now and not sure if I left anything out, will add more if I think of anything. Looking for any tips on how to start dealing with these issues on my own before my appointment. I also had the idea of doing drugs as a way to make myself lose control to see that I won't repeat my past and that I'm not that person, I've never smoked or done anything so would obviously start small if I did any at all. Any insight you guys can offer is appreciated.

Thanks so much for reading.",10Mar2019,1

30,"Okay so this is going to need some explaining. So I (27) was recently diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder despite having suffered from it since age 12. It's a horrible illness but honestly, I've had it so long that I've got a pretty good handle on it, although a couple months ago I had a pretty awful acute episode which meant I had to see my GP and was signed off work. At the beginning of last year I had my wisdom tooth taken out by a dentist who has since had their practice shut down. Long story short she yanked with too much gusto and my jaw is fucked up. It's not bone related though, it's muscle related and the specialist prescribed me valium as a muscle relaxant. 

My GP however, decided that because I have anxiety I can't be having those (despite... well the obvious, and the fact that I can source and consume as many benzos as I like if I want to) and refused to give me any pain medication for this. Instead he decided that it was because of anxiety and put me on antidepressants. The two aren't related in the slightest, they're two different complaints. Ironically, my jaw pain makes my already terrible insomnia worse and that actually does affect my anxiety. 

Does anyone have any suggestions about what to do or say to my GP to get them to understand? I tried going there to just ask for pain relief, armed with my note from the specialist (bc I have a mental illness so I'm OBVIOUSLY trying to score) and the doctor just shouted over the top of me trying to explain saying over and over ""I CANT GIVE YOU VALIUM"". I  was trying to get some naproxen or something yknow? I'm kinda just venting because this whole situation has really boiled my piss but I would really welcome some suggestions on what to do. I can't really switch practices because it will definitely look like I'm trying to score valium after the other GP said no. I've called the specialist and asked them to speak to my GP but the GP just ignored him. ",10Mar2019,2

33,"TLDR; I've started having anxiety attacks in crowds, and need tips for getting through an important life event that is going to be crowded. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 24 year old woman and have recently (within the last 8 weeks) started experiencing some severe panic attacks. I've always been an ""anxious"" person, but this is the first time I'd say I've ever had actual attacks. To give some reference, I'm in my last semester of graduate school and have been talking to a therapist on my campus for the last 3 months. She and my fiance are the only ones who knows the extent of my MH situation right now.

&amp;#x200B;

My first panic attacked happened in the middle of a class talking about mental health. My classes all have 100 people in them and are held in a large auditorium. Every time I'm in that auditorium now, or in any large group at all (watching a comedy show at a club, at a dance recital), I get feelings of anxiety about having an attack, and occasional have one and have to step out for a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been working on strategies to help stop the attacks before they're full blown, such as deep breathing, repeating a mantra, full body scans, eating a small piece of candy, etc. These help, but simply knowing I have an exit plan and that I can leave makes me feel the most reassured. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm graduating with my masters in 2 months. This will be in a very large hall with hundreds of people there, and I'm now so afraid I won't be able to sit through the ceremony without having a complete meltdown. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone have any tips to prepare for this? I can't exactly be whipping out starbursts or leaving to calm myself down at an event like this, but any advice would be so appreciated. Love this subreddit and the little community its built.",10Mar2019,1
34,"I was leaving work today and ran into an old friend from higschool (we graduated 2 years ago) and he was in a really bad mood. He has always struggled with a mental disability but always seemed to be able to handle it enough to get through school and daily life. I used to make sure people did not makes jokes about him if me or him were around because I knew how horrible that would feel for him to be singled out and because he deserved a friend. 

He remembered me quickly and seemed happy to see me, then he started to talk about how he hated his job at wal mart and how he hated life in general. I tried to cheer him up but he just stayed in a real depressed mood. he had to go because his lunch break was ending soon and he just faded back down the sidewalk as I walked to my car saying goodbye.

the answer is probably easy to my question but I just feel better about writing it out. Is there anything that I can do in my power to help make his life better? I am going to try to see him again and give him my number so he can feel like he has a true friend but i just feel like i could do more. i truly am scared that he will take his life before he is 30 because of how depressed and down he seemed about his life. i cant put it into writing the way I felt when talking to him. it just seemed so dark and depressing. I know that mental health issues can be a rollercoaster of emotions but I have known this kid from 2nd grade to graduation and he has never seemed so sad about his life.

I was eating dinner just a little bit ago when i remembered this and started to cry because I remember how happy he was when we were little and after seeing him today I could see that the life had been sucked out of him. I cant handle seeing somebody my age so helpless and depressed when we are JUST getting started with our adult lives. I'm sorry if this is in the wrong sub reddit. ",10Mar2019,2

Im going trough hell rn because for the first time since 6th grade i want to live 


I live in Quebec where anyone can have mental help quick!!!:))... if you have money and or insurances... 

Which i dont im quite literally poor. Altought there are options for people like me , if you dont pay, you will wait a hell of a long time to get that help you so desperately need. I had been on that list since sixth grade and just recently got an actual psychologist !! 

Now dont get me wrong im more then happy but since it had been a while i began to think pretty quick that i was never gonna get help so i just went on a downward spiral of self destruction. I started doing drugs , nothing too crazy. Abused amphetamines , tried a couple of opioids ,lots and lots of weed. Never cared because i tought i'd never get help and i would end up killing myself, also never tought i had a problem because i wasnt doing hard drugs often i mostly did weed and you know most people ( including me ) consider that pretty harmless. That is if you dont smoke every day 4 times a day which i do. 
Now i can imagine my mental health must have suffered a lot from that especially my anxiety even thought i cant tell the difference because i feel like i always felt this bad, i know thats not the case and i know drugs fuck your brain up.

But now i met someone about a little more then  year ago who put me back on the right track without even knowing probably, he made me try harder in school which i had completly given up on, he made me want to get better he gave me hope. He's the most wonderful person i've ever met and its the first time i dont doubt someones feelings towards me. I know he loves me and he loves me the right way and i've never had that. 


Anyways my point is now i want a futur , i want to live i want to see myself at 30with a good job and someone to come home to ( hopefully him ) 
But im trapped in the lifestyle ive been living . I dont want drugs in my life and yet they always find their way back to me , i dont think im addicted but i do think i have a problem with them , especially weed and amphetamines but particularly weed i will never say no and cannot say no to weed. 

But i know theyre screwing this up i wanna get better. Im trapped in a dying mind but i have so much will i want to be good. Not fck fantastic just not fck sick.


I do what i can, i cut out toxic people, trying to change the way eat, trying to change my sleep schedule hanging out more with people that make me feel loved cared for and accepted and im trying to stop things that i know have tendencies to make me sad and or anxious ( ex: i unsubscribed from all the morbid subreddits i was  following , im tryinf to stop watching true crime video) and im trying to give myself a more positive view on life ( stupid exemple: i follow the dodo their videos are wholesome and give me faith in humanity ) 
But im kinda putting sticks in my own wheels by continuously smoking weed and taking amphets ""one last time""

Also my familial situation ( if thats even a word) isnt the best, im very fragile and the mood here is always tense and stresseful so im trying to move out but im 16.

45,"As the title suggests I’m 99% sure my boyfriend is a sociopath.  We’ve only been dating for 5 months, but that’s more than enough time to determine this.   We met on Tinder, and from the very start he was super charming.  I don’t think anyone has ever given me that much attention in my life.  He quickly convinced me to delete Tinder.  ( he said he did the same ) 

Things kept moving alarmingly fast.   I’m pretty sure he was already using the word “love” by the third date.  
But I don’t think he knows what love is.   This dude lacks empathy.  Here’s some examples ~

1 )  We’re in Walmart because I’m wanting to find something specific for my nieces birthday party.   Out of the corner of my eye I see a lady crying hysterically.  I go up to her &amp; ask her what’s wrong.   She tells me a bit about the troubles she’s having that I won’t go into,  but I try my best to comfort her.   When I finally go back to what I was doing I can’t find my boyfriend.   

Turns out he just went back to the car and sat there.  He’s super pissed at me, and tells me I’m wasting his time.  And questions why I should “feel sorry for anyone.”  Then I explain her situation and all he says is “so what?”  So now, I’m pissed.  Then I’m like “what if it was me, or your mom, x, y, z” etc?  All he says is “that’s still not my problem.   I decide to just let it go.

2 )  I’m scrolling on Facebook.  I see this article about a puppy that was tied, and burned.   I’m visibly getting upset reading this disgusting ass article.  And I say out loud “how can anyone be this evil?”  He asks me what I’m looking at &amp; I show him.   So he says, “I don’t see the big deal, animals can’t even think.  You’re working yourself up over nothing.”  I was literally speechless and again dropped  it.

Over the last 5 months he’s been terrible about making promises he can’t keep.  Movie night?  Excuse.  Bowling?  Excuse.  Dinner?  Excuse.  He even lied about the type of car he had.   Then he tries to tell me he never said that.  Like wtf?  It’s not even like I care about that stuff.  But why would you lie?  He also lied about what kind of work he does.   On his dating profile it said he’s an engineer.   I recently learned he’s actually just a server on &amp; off.   

I’m sure you guys are wondering at this point..  why am I still with him?  Because at the time I didn’t want to question him.   Stuff happens, and you can’t always come through with plans.   But, now that I’m adding all of this up, and looking back.   It just seems really strange.   But I kind of just feel bad for him you know?   And I want to get him the help he needs *if* he’s actually a sociopath.   I’m just a really empathetic person.  

He didn’t ask to be like this.  I’m just a really empathetic person.   Tomorrow night I plan to spend the night with him.   I’ve got a few articles printed out on the diagnosis, examples ( internet examples and my own ), treatments etc.  some doctors offices as well, and I want to confront him on it.   

What do you guys think?

46,"I'm suffering from a lot of mental health issues to the point of moving back into my mother's property so much so that i'm having a hard time with daily upkeep as well as need help with my son. I have a hard time getting out of bed and doing normal things other than making sure my son gets up for school, is fed, and goes to bed on time.  My mother has 2 properties; one for her and my older brother who has is own issues (he self medicates with alcohol and weed), and one she just bought that has my younger brother, my son, and a couple of tenants who uses a separate entrance.

&amp;#x200B;

My brother and I have a rocky sibling relationship, he is very argumentative and tries to bring me down as much as possible to the point of being emotional, mental, and use verbal abuse to me. I am honestly scared that he is going to be violent because he has a horrible temper, though my mother swears up and down that will never happen. I usually argue back but it's starting to get taxing and I don't like doing it in front of my son since my father did the same thing to me growing up. My mother honestly thinks that because it's been going on so long between my brother and I, that we are just jealous of each other and that we will have to get along because eventually he will be moving into the property she just brought soon.

&amp;#x200B;

I mentioned that I have a hard time doing normal everyday things, he says that i'm just lazy, calls me useless, and/or makes nasty remarks on how I can't keep a job, no one wants to live with me, and can't keep a relationship. I just don't know what to do anymore, I don't mind ignoring him, however, he actively seeks me out for these arguments when ever he sees me and then gets mad if I don't respond to him. I just want him to leave me alone and not talk to me if he is going to say these things to me. It wasn't until I told my mother that I wanted to be admitted into a hospital that she started to say that she would talk to my brother about his behavior so that way she doesn't have to kick him out. And? Nothing, nothing has changed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to get disability and get the treatment I need to get better... to get stable. I also want my son to have stability since we have been moving around nonstop since he was born. He has been to different school each year and even in the middle of the year due to the moving. It's going to the point where he thinks it's normal to be at different schools and is looking forward to the next school. I want to stay and I can not afford to move again, and I wouldn't have anywhere to go. I don't know what to do or what to think about this situation, It's the first time that I had thoughts that it's just best for me to not exist. I can't provide for my son, I can finally be left alone, and I wouldn't have to feel like I was such a waste of space. The only thing stopping me from acting on it is that I know my son will miss me.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like i'm just a spoiled brat whining. In honesty, I just want the cycle of abuse to end.

They feel like delusions, the idea that I died from my overdose 2 years ago and living in hell, that employers blacklisted me, and a few others. But every single one of them I know is false.

56,"I'll keep this as brief as I can as the purpose of this post is partially to vent but also to see if anybody has advice to offer.

I suffer from mild GAD.

I think that it's relatively well controlled and, for the most part, I get on fine in everyday life and running my own business (exceptions: a couple of weird sensory issues, like sound sensitivity, that are quite bothersome).

**However, I do suffer from panic disorder which is more of a problem.**

Particularly, I am pretty much guaranteed to experience a panic attack under the following circumstances:

* Relatively high and sustained daily coffee consumption (&gt; 4 cups/day).
* One night's drinking, where alcohol consumption is more than 4 pints.

I know that the obvious advice is ""well, don't drink coffee and alcohol then!"". I don't want to give up coffee because, as somebody working 12+ hours/day, I find it invaluable for giving me the stamina to succeed in business. I've tried to give up, but cannot afford the inevitable productivity slump right now. The alcohol is a nice counterbalance to being  hyper-caffeinated all week, and I drink almost exclusively in social settings.

However:

Having a panic attack after every night out (about once every two or three weeks) is clearly not sustainable (FWIW, on such occasions I take half a Xanax and am fine).

My doctor says that I should start an SSRI but I am terrified of doing so and have read all these horrible posts about experiencing withdrawals and ""brain zaps"". 

I've been really hoping that some combination of meditation, a healthy diet, and exercise will make the panic attacks go away but so far nothing has ""broken through"" for me.

Anybody in a similar situation? I reckon I'll probably have to bite the bullet and start the SSRI but wish there were an alternative.",10Mar2019,1
57,"long story short I’m a sensitive, emotional guy and for whatever reason people either hate me tbh like instantly, or i just perceive them as doing so because i’m so incredibly sensitive and insecure. i hate writing another one of these ranty posts but it’s the only way for me to get what i’m feeling out so it doesn’t eat me up inside, so apologies in advance for the whining over nothing 

what “triggered” this is my family went out for dinner, the waitress is charming and friendly with everyone else in my family as SOON as she locks eyes with me, her entire mood switches and she’s abrupt, curt, looks unhappy to be even talking with me, etc. 

I’m depressed, and lately have been doing a poor job of hiding my feelings, so i can see why someone may perceive that depression as meanness, but even when i’m being NICE and i’m not showing any outward signs of emotional instability, people still seem to dislike me instantly. i’m not awkward in the sense i can’t hold a conversation, if anything people get awkward around me,

i’m not hideous, so that explanation just doesn’t work for me. i’m in touch with my feminine side so i understand if people are against that, but because you can’t be sure that’s the reason it still hurts a lot. 

what this rambling comes down to is i can’t stand, more than anything in the world, being thought of as some freak who deserves to be ostracized. i’m a 21 year old guy and i don’t see myself living much longer if this continues, or i become a hermit who lives in the woods. 

i wish i could ask someone who knows irl who isn’t close enough with me they would lie to me, but close enough springing this on them wouldn’t be weird, unfortunately i don’t anyone like that, and the internet is all i have. obviously no one can tell what’s wrong with me over a few paragraphs, and i’ve already seen therapists

i guess what i’m asking is still what it comes down to in the title, am i being paranoid? or is likely this is holds water and people do dislike me right off the bat",10Mar2019,1
58,"So, I have depression and anxiety.  I'm pretty open about these facts as a part of self therapy. (Trying not to hide feelings from everyone) A while ago I was talking to a coworker about her Crohn's disease and what she said still bothers me a year later. 


She was telling me how hard it was for her to have what she called an 'invisible disease'. How people would brush off the fact that she was sick because they couldn't see what was wrong with her. And how people would belittle the choices she would make to lessen her pain or tell her to get over it. I mentioned that I understood what that was like because of my depression. I wasn't trying to brush off her suffering because other people are in similar situations.  I was trying to find a bit of common ground and talk about how shitty people can be sometimes.  


She turned to me and said; ""It's not the same thing. I have an actual disease that effects my day to day life.""

59,"Hey, I am sorry if this is the wrong place for this, I wanted to spread it as this has given me some closure finally for the feeling of being alone that constantly comes back and sits in my chest.

As a baby, I had a very traumatic birth, firstly the nurse didn't noticed my heart rate dropping, my dad noticed it but the nurse had already told my mum to start pushing. I had already gotten down and started to be born but I got stuck, the nurse went out and got a doctor, she said my mum would need to push me out as I was unable to breath, but the doctor said there wouldn't be enough time, and I had to be pushed back into my mum's stomach to be cut out. They said they'd never seen a baby more stuck. They said I was court on stuff in my mum and twisted around. (might explain why I like bdsm so much 🤷‍♂️). But then to top it off, as soon as I was born I was taken away from both my parents and taken to a emergency room, if not I'd be dead. 

Until now I've always associated the feeling with the fact I've never had a relationship, never had sex, never really had much intermit experience ever even though I'm at uni. I have had bad social anxiety all my life and always been really negative towards myself. I try not to. But now I feel like this feeling stems from my birth, the fact I was taken from my parents straight away, I'm sure would have some effects like this.

Well what do you guys think? Could this finally be the root of the problem ?",10Mar2019,1
60,"Much of my behavior, decisions, isolation, self-hate and difficulties with getting help, which lead to other problems, is connected with anxiety coping. I don't avoid most situations, I suffer through them, but sometimes when I have to avoid and my behavior seemingly wouldn't make sense, I have to be an asshole, and sometimes I get into heated argument just because I need to justify avoidant behavior in some way that makes sense to others. Of course I feel terrible about it. Hell, I'd probably wrestle a grizzly bear in order to avoid some situations that cause anxiety. Most of the time when I think how easy it'd be to just die, it's not because of some deep-rooted depressive thoughts, it's simply the urgent need to escape immediately. If depression and dysphoria alone aren't able to push me over the edge, anxiety is. The urge to escape immediately is different than the wish to fall asleep. Every single therapist and psychologist I met just ignored, or even reinforced my anxiety. I'm always expecting the worst and I don't think I've ever felt relaxed in my life. Depression and dysphoria is an occasional reason for wanting to die, but anxiety makes it permanent and so it doesn't take any breaks.

Also, people who suggest illicit drugs or therapy prove that they haven't understood a word of what I was just saying.

When I started Pregabalin, an anti-convulsant that's popular for anxiety outside of the US, I didn't even notice that I didn't have any death thoughts for weeks. I stopped soon after. When I had a really bad breakdown last year I took the prescription meds as prescribed, which included this one, things became so quiet. As if someone declared a cease-fire, and you wonder what the hell you were doing until now. I figured that I don't want to get used to that, because that would mean dependence, but I felt that things would escalate if I kept having more breakdowns. So I underdosed as much as I could. 

It's been half a year and I'm getting worried about withdrawals for this and the antidepressant. Everything is just so fucked up. Life felt threatening, and death felt safe, but now I know anxiety medication can make me question that world view, but I also know that ḿedication is just a lie. A path into tolerance, withdrawals, social stigma and addiction. It doesn't fix problems. So what's the point? If I'm broken, I'm broken.",10Mar2019,1
61,"Apologies if this moves around a lot try to bear with me. Also it’s gonna be kinda long I need serious air.

I fucked up pretty hard. The other day I did mdma with 2 of my friends (1 a girl in my class, another a guy in my class i also live with) and the night when on for a long time, somehow, due to the fearlessness I felt on m (and probably also wanting help and not wanting to be alone) I not only shared with them that I had been depressed and recently made the decision to kill myself only to breakdown and change my mind but also shared that I was sexually abused when I was younger and how i was told if i told my parents they wouldn’t love me anymore and how I gained abandonment issues it’s fucked me up ever since then(side note: one of them, the one i live with already knew about that because i shared it with him a previous time we did m, the suicide was new though). I also said a slew of different things but i was so high and pretty drunk (combined with the fact that I’ve most definitely repressed the memory, I’ll get flashes and freak out) I go to school with them and it’s a small class of 14. I’ve spent the past week of Break freaking out every time I think about it because I feel I ruined what would’ve been a good bonding moment for me and that girl, also I feel I’ve now employed her as a helper for me and added a whole new level of worry she never needed to have. And it stresses me out and I can’t help but feel everything’s fallen apart. I’ve tried smoking weed since then and it just gets me extremely paranoid and immediately gives me panic attacks. I realized I’ve been using drugs as a way to make me feel like I’m okay and now drugs don’t do that for me anymore. When she left that night I called her and we talked for a bit and at the end I said goodbye my love in a strictly platonic and endearing way as I sometimes say it to people and I was on molly but it sounded like I shook her and freaked her out and I’m gonna see her on monday and everything feels so fragile and I’m at a loss because 1. I’m not gonna kill myself, I had a friend I knew that killed himself less than a year ago and I realized how it fucked me up and how stupid it was for me to think I was gonna do that to others. 2. I’m in school abroad and no one from back home talks to me because I’m so busy and nobody here really hits me up just to chat either so I’m just alone spiraling 3. There’s NOBODY I can tell without pulling them into the situation and changing my relationship with them forever too so basically this is where you come in reddit. If anybody could just help me, maybe give me a more positive outlook, outline some areas in which I might just be spiralling and I shouldn’t worry, and maybe just maybe someone who could talk to me here and there who would help me out even though they don’t need to, I would really appreciate it. I really need a friend right now.

For clarification, in the moment, I process it as legitimately funny, like a good joke from a stand up comic. 

For example, the first time someone pointed it out as abnormal was way when I was in high school, and a fellow mistook me for someone who had been talking trash about his sister, and he looked like a roided out gorilla.

Well, he popped me good, well enough to hairline fracture my cheekbone, and I, though I was hurting too, thought well, today is it, and I started laughing. To me, it was funny. Freaked him out though.

67,"Hey, 20M from Europe here. I've started a job a year ago alongside school. At the beginning it was really exciting to learn about the theoretical aspect of my occupation in school and doing it in practice at work. But as school became more serious and demanding since we are close to graduation and I have increased my work hours, I've become so frustrated and stressed out.
It all worsened in October, when I worked a total of 150 hours that month and went to school fulltime. As you can imagine, I had NO free time at all. 
But not only that, I have also lost the passion for my job. Some people are nice there, but my boss really doesn't know what they're doing and the staff feels unappreciated and shitty because of the way we are treated.
To add to all of that, people have been gossiping behind my back and have told lies about me to my boss. So the human resources employee had a private conversation with me about it. She didn't believe my part of the story and it was so frustrating. They all pretended like I was an unreliable employee who didn't know what they were doing. Of course only the people who didn't like me told these lies about me.
Everything from the past year caught up on me in that moment and it all became to much for me. I excused myself and ran away criying, feeling absolutely raw and shitty. I haven't cried in years, and it felt kind of like a relieve.
I was told to get a grip and I continued my work day sorely.
The story should have ended right there, right? But since I had that breakdown, I still feel that raw, metallic feeling in my chest, like being vulnerable and still healing. I don't feel confident anymore and I am on the edge constantly.

I have no faith that I can get better, so throughout the therapy sessions I had a constant feeling of meaninglessness and confusion. The conversations were incredibly stale and left me feeling empty and did not give me any new insights or anything that I could work on.

The therapist of course noticed my feelings and after a while asked me if I wanted to book another session. In response I asked her if there was a point to it, and if she thought that the therapy would help me. She told me that she did not think that the therapy would help, so I of course declined booking another session.

73,"Hi I'm quite new to reddit and this is my first post

So I had worries about focusing in class and was even getting detentions for doing so. I went to the doctors with my mum and they started to do tests like qb tests and family and school surveys. Yesterday I got a letter though the post saying that the doctors are pitting me on medications. My mum and my sister were over the moon about it but for me something changed. In school I'm known for a funny and witty personality and I don't want that to change. The letter even came with forms saying things like ""does you child keep you up at night?"" And  ""struggleing to cope with you child?"". After looking at them it made me feel like I was a burden to my family. Since reading them my mood has shifted from light hearted to a saddened and angry phase almost instantly.

If anyone has any advice on coping with this please let me know.
It would mean the world.",10Mar2019,2

76,"In this video and article I will be discussing the root of fear and I will offer some techniques that you can use to overcome fear, right now in your life.  Here is a link to the video:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMh2U7Q7yDo&amp;list=PLUu0vvUFCeQa4dNVttnHZucVE7gq27cqQ&amp;index=2&amp;t=50s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMh2U7Q7yDo&amp;list=PLUu0vvUFCeQa4dNVttnHZucVE7gq27cqQ&amp;index=2&amp;t=50s)

First off I would like to discuss the root of fear.

ActiveBeat.com states it, “Fear is said to be the most powerful emotion known to humankind. More powerful even than love. Our very survival depends on it. Fear is triggered in the most primitive part of our brain. The part responsible for alerting and protecting us from danger. Keeping us safe. Keeping us alive. Fear in the form of the fight or flight response to stress originated with our earliest ancestors when confronted with life threatening danger.

When the cave man stumbled into the path of a Saber-toothed tiger his fight or flight response was triggered. His heart rate shot up, pumping oxygenated blood to his muscles, his breathing rate increased, blood was diverted from his brain and organs to supply his muscles, and adrenaline was released into his bloodstream. All these things occurred so that he could either fight the tiger or run for his life.” That is a quote from ActiveBeat.com

Psychology Today States it this way, “Fear is a vital response to physical and emotional danger; it has strong roots in human evolution. If people didn’t feel fear, they couldn’t protect themselves from legitimate threats, which in the ancestral world frequently resulted in life-or-death consequences… In the past, human ancestors feared immediate danger, from volcano eruptions to hungry predators.”

That is a quote from psycolygytoday.com

I believe fear is a natural emotion that was designed by the creator of Universe to help protect living beings from danger and to survive on Planet Earth.

Will still use fear today to protect us for example, when you go to the ATM machine at your bank at night you might feel fear and this is your body making you more cautious and aware of your surroundings. This is a natural response. Or for example, if you are walking down an ally in a rough neighborhood at night, your senses may be activated and your mind may become much more aware looking for possible was to get out of a troubled situation. This is fear.

We no longer have Saber-toothed tigers to contend with today. However in this day and age it’s often our own irrational fears that send us running for cover. There are many types of fears in the world today that people experience on a daily basis ranging from fear of Spiders to the fear of Death. There are many trivial things people fear in life like the fear of flying, the fear of public speaking, the fear of heights and the fear of the dark.

Some more paralyzing things people fear today, which are quoted from ActiveBeat.com here, are more like, fear of failure (Like fearing you are going to loose your job or that you are going to fail your classes in college.) Many people fear commitment or intimacy (People with this fear often had dismissive or rejecting parents who were unable to fulfill their childhood needs for safety and security. Another fear people have is the fear of rejection (Fear of rejection is a deep seated human fear that can be especially problematic. Humans long to be accepted and this basic primitive need is entrenched in our very survival as a species. Children who grow up in dysfunctional families may go to unhealthy extremes to be accepted by romantic partners or peers. They usually suffer from low self-esteem and fear being ostracized or rejected. They imagine catastrophic consequences as a result of not fitting in. The fight or flight response to stress may be triggered, causing them to take dangerous risks or go to extremes to avoid being rejected by their social circle. Many people fear dying or that they may become physically ill and become immobile or paralyzed. (Tragically, for some the fear of their future demise can be so overwhelming that they forget to live in the now.) All of this is just fear!

So knowing that we all have fears in our life, you may ask the question, “So what I am to do about it, and how can I get rid of fear???” Although you may never completely get rid of fear in your life, I would like to offer a few techniques that you can use to start overcoming fear, right now in your life.

These techniques are quoted from WakeUpCloud.com.

Become aware of your fears. “Before you can begin overcoming fear, you have to be aware that your fears are causing havoc in your life. It’s easy to get so attached to your thoughts and feelings that you think they are all that exist, which couldn’t be further from the truth. You are not your fears. You are the awareness that experiences it.”

Identify your fears. “Get specific about what exactly you’re afraid of. Look at the pictures you have in your head about the situation. What is happening in them? What are you really scared of? Become an observer of your inner space.”

Get in the now. “What are you lacking right now? When you center yourself in the now, you realize that everything is how it is. You naturally accept what is. Tapping into the now can be as simple as feeling your body and breath. My favorite book on the subject is The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle.”

Become grateful. “Whenever you feel fear, switch it over to what you are grateful for instead.”

Take Action. “I’m an action taker, and I know that fears are just fears. They are created by my imagination to make reality seem scarier than it is. When you take action and face your fears, they become weaker, because you realize that reality isn’t nearly as bad as your imagination.”

Become positive. “Whenever fear strikes, flip it over. Instead of thinking of something bad that can happen, think of something positive. What’s a positive outcome to your fear? If you’re thinking about public speaking, imagine yourself being wildly successful instead of failing horribly. “

Get into perspective. “Learning to deal with fear is all about putting your negative thoughts in perspective. We tend to focus too much on the negative, so by looking at all the options, you often realize that you’re making a big deal of nothing. There are so many things that can happen that it’s impossible for you to predict. We aren’t psychics.”

Surrender to your fears. “Surrendering to what is powerful, because as long as we try to change what is, we are in war with reality.’

Release Control. “We want to learn how to control fear. We want predictability, even though it’s impossible to get. Where we don’t have control, we experience fear. But is it possible to ever have control? Even if you can swim, you can drown. A professional guitar player can still make mistakes and butcher a gig. Give up the illusion of control, and you’re free.”

Help others. “Be kind to others. If you’re shy, focus on helping people instead of being self-conscious about how you look or sound when you talk. Flip it on other people and make yourself feel good.”

Find a meaning to your fears. “I believe we all go through things for a reason. That includes the fears we have. It also includes overcoming fear and learning the lessons that come out of it. This may not be the case 100% of the time, but when I look back at the challenges and fears in my life, I see that more often than not, they delivered exactly the message I needed at that time.”

Explore Your Roots. “What is the root of your fear? This may require some meditation. Look inside and ask yourself when the fear started. If you’re afraid of public failure for example, when did it happen? Where you shamed in public when you were younger?”

Lastly just be still and breathe. “Your breath can set you free. It can anchor you in the now and help you vanquish and overcome your most pervasive fears.”

So to conclude, understanding that fear is a natural emotion that was designed to protect us from danger, we come to an understanding that we may never completely get rid of fear in our lives. But we can begin to use some techniques to help us deal with fear in our lives and we can begin to let go of them and not let them control our lives.

Simply take a breath, be still, let go, and be free.

77,"Hi guys, me again. I posted the other day about my withdrawals from Mirtazapine. I have now gone down to half a tablet every second day, I literally can not sleep. For anyone who has done ecstasy or MDMA, I feel like I am on that right now. I have so much energy and overwhelming anxiety, which I haven’t felt for years. All I want to do is sleep but my brain is going a million miles a minute. It’s strange because today I was so exhausted, apparently Mirtazapine in small doses work as a sedative but now I am feeling the completely opposite. I believe what I am experiencing is hypermania and it is very uncomfortable and quite scary. Not entirely sure what I am looking for with this post, maybe I just need to vent. But I am straight up not having a good time. ",10Mar2019,1
78," I never told anyone this, but I think it will be good for me to tell, even to a bunch of strangers in the internet! Firstly I need to apologize about all the spelling/grammar errors that most likely will end up in this post since English is not my native language, and the story is very emotional and hard for me to formulate.

I have never told anyone this, because I am so ashamed. About five years ago (I was almost 18 at the time) I was on a school trip to Rome. One of the days we were on the metro in the afternoon rush, so it was totaly packed, and I got pushed away from my class mates. When I sudently feel a hand on the backside/innerside of my thigh. I was wearing a dress that went nearly to my knees, so this hand was slightly under my dress. I first thought was that it probably was a mistake/someone who lost their balance or whatever, and try to move that foot infront of the other to ""shrug"" the hand of. Keep in mind the Metro was PACKED, so I could not move away. Then I feel the hand move uppwards on my inner thigh, and I totaly freze. I am one of the most conflict shy people I know (earlier on the trip I let a pickpocketer rumble through my bag in peace without showing any signs that I knew he/she was doing it, I didn't even turn around to look at the person (I had only an umberella and a waterbotle in my bag)), so it should not suprise me that i Froze, but I am still so embarresed that I did nothing to stop what was to happen. The hand went further up under my underwear (both a spandex type of shorts, just that it was a bit loose, so not too difficult to move your hand under, and boxerstyles pants) and I could feel his fingers inside me. I have no consept of time, since I was totaly frozen, but something sudently made me get out of the frozen state and move away somehow (probably a stop were a lot of people was going on/off so a lot of people shufeling around) and I mangaged to get over to some class mates and made sure that I had some of my friends directly behind me the rest of the trip.

I have had a lot of mental health problems all my life (Depression, anxiety and later got the diagnose BPD), but this started a new type of anxiety; where I would start panicking if anyone was behind me, expessialy in public. So if someone sat behind me on the buss, or in the classroom I would feel the start of a panick attack, and having anyone standing behind me was a total no-no. Fully packed places was my apsolute nightmare. This ofcourse ruined alot of my classes as well as a lot of social interactions. For a long time I didnt understand why this was (I kinda repressed the hole memory out of shame for a long time) and when I was in therapy some years later I sudently remembered, and started crying like crazy. Still I never told my therapist this because I was/am still so ashamed that I just let someone violate me like that and IN PUBLIC, with sooo many people around. I feel like I just let it happen, and therefor deserved it.

Just to end on a bit of a positive side: I am now much better when it comes to my anxiety of having people behind me. I still feel uncomfortabel having anyone behind me and if I am standing on the buss I make sure I have a wall behind my back, but the last months I have taken the buss to and from classes at Uni, and every day it is a bit easier :)",10Mar2019,10
79,"It’s been 4 days I’ve managed to go without trying to text or call him. 

I tried to cut him out of my life myself but I crawled back within hours. Then I spiralled for days and kept trying to contact him. 

Dug myself a hole.

Please be gentle with me, I have been very suicidal since it happened, I had the police called to my house to check on me and I was supposed to go to the hospital. 

I am getting better but as soon as I’m alone and it’s quiet I am constantly worried he will just ghost me. He has given me zero indication if he’s cutting me off for good, forever, or if this no-contact is temporary. I feel utterly confused and disoriented and abandoned and scared. 

He was my rock for five months and we were sleeping together. 

I’m terrified he will just never reply to what I last said, never see me ever again, that it’s all blown to pieces and he won’t even tell me it’s over.

Then I’m terrified that once he does, it will destroy me. 

I can’t live in this confusion and fear and pain. I feel like I can’t live without him.

80,"I love listening to sad music even though it triggers negative thoughts and I end up hurt again and again. And I don't think I can stop. People's best advice is to see a therapist but I can't do that. Does that make me a fool then? I don't seek out help even though I advise others to do so? 

It's been like this for years. I make myself sad and depressed and then I become easily susceptible to criticism and hurtful words and that pushes me even deeper into the dark. Does it even make sense? Where's the logic in that? Sometimes it's a mess inside my head. There's too much unsaid but I want to keep things quiet, because I feel like if someone knew, I'd be so vulnerable to pain and judgement. ",10Mar2019,4
81,"My friend’s been struggling with depression and anxiety for more than four years now, and I think it’s her worst time yet. She made a promise to my friend that she wouldn’t commit suicide, but she keeps relapsing (not taking meds, attempting to kill herself) then having to go to us for help. 

We feel like we’re repeating the same things and I even think we’re making it worse for her. And to top it all off, apparently her father is moving out because he’s had enough and needs a break. So she feels really fucking lonely and that everyone will leave her (trust issues). 

How can I help her? What should I say to her?

After an emotional review in which I realized they're still not understanding the way deafness makes me unable to communicate the way they would like, I went to my counselor who works at a deaf organization, to write them a letter explaining this in the hopes they will stop holding it against me. I think she had offered to talk to them about my mental health as well, but at the time I did no because I didn't want to appear weak. Not now I'm thinking maybe they will better be able to support me if they knew. Not that they provide support our seem to care really. ",10Mar2019,1
83,"Basically I keep feeling sick everyday and it’s getting worse. It started about three weeks ago when I was at my friends house I ended up feeling sick and was really close to throwing up but I managed to stop myself. I wasn’t anxious that night I had just ate way too much but I’ve always had a bit of a fear of being sick. 

The next weekend I went out to lunch with my girlfriend and I ended up feeling really sick after it but it was different to the usual feeling. It was the first time we went out so I had been nervous and lost my appetite and I felt really nauseous. 

Then a few days ago I had an event on at my school and I went with my mum and we went to a presentation in a classroom and it was really warm and crammed and I thought “it would be really bad if I ended up feeling sick” and then I started to feel sick and then my heart started beating rapidly. Then I couldn’t breathe properly and I was worried that people could tell because only one person was talking and that was the teacher doing the presentation. So I was really worried I was about to be sick and twenty minutes later I still felt the same but it was getting worse. My arms started to get tingly and then it went to my hands and it’s hard to describe it’s like the worst pins and needles I’ve ever had. I thought I was about to pass out so I had to leave the presentation. I felt fine after a couple minutes but I didn’t go back in. I’m not sure but I think it might have been a panic attack. 

Every time I’ve went out since then I keep feeling sick but I think it’s because I’m worried about feeling sick that it actually makes me feel sick. 

Then today my girlfriend was coming over to my house and she wanted me to come and meet her parents when they dropped her off so this morning before she arrived I was starting to feel anxious and my dad gave me a bowl of spaghetti hoops and I could only manage to eat half of it because I thought I was going to throw up. After that everything was fine until tonight when I went out with my friends. We went to the cinema and then McDonald’s after it and I was really hungry because I had barely eaten anything all day but when we got to McDonald’s I started to feel really sick and I was worried I’d end up being sick over my friends. I could barely eat any of my food and now every time I go out to eat I just end up feeling sick.

I’m really not sure what this is and I’m not diagnosed with anything but some of my friends have told me they think I have anxiety and I’m almost certain I have OCD. I just want to know what I can do to get rid of this and what it might be and what’s causing it.

Thank you for reading this and I’m sorry it was so long.",10Mar2019,1
84,"Hi

&amp;#x200B;

This might seem like a stupid post. I know there is no cure I can offer him but I want to help in some way, maybe someone who has experienced this can give me advice? Maybe I am just looking for comfort this is very difficult  


Backstory:

Me, my mom and dad never ever talked openly about mental health or our feelings, though we do have a good relationship. I love both of them, but I am not very close with them. It feels very superficial. We have a backstory with mental health. I have been anorexic and suicidal in my teens, but found a therapist on my own. I had burnout last year because of work and was depressed, but found a very good art therapist. We never talked about it in our family, only my boyfriend knows. My parents didnt even know anything was wrong with me I think.

 My mum tried to kill herself when I was 14 and was suffering from bulimia for very long. We NEVER talked about it and just brushed it off. My dad has been having ""depressive episodes"" on and off. When he lost his first job (he became alcoholic after), we lost our house and my parents moved in with my grandpa, because we had no money to afford anything.  I moved out then (I was 17). My dad got a new job, took up sports again, was going on trips with his friends. All seemed great! I was so happy for my parents, they were doing so great. They went on holidays and did parenty things i always wanted them to do.

Then in 2014 my grandpa died, another shock for my dad. Since he died they kept saying they were gonna renovate the house and throw out my grandpas stuff. Of course it takes time to grief.. but its been 5 years and everyday my dad is still surrounded by everything.. it looks like my grandpa just walked out the door. They stil have his clothes.. his bed.. everything! 

So my dad has been sick since january, something with his lungs and blood pressure. They suspected cancer but luckily it turned out it wasnt. I do suspect he has some issue he doesnt talk to us about. Due to his illness he couldnt work. Then he had legal problems with a car accident he wasnt involved in, he was just a bystander. I dont fully grasp the situation but they took his drivers license, so he cant work, and his work fired him. 

&amp;#x200B;

His current situation is being jobless, sitting in his tiny flat, surrounded by the stuff of his dead dad, watching TV all day and contacting nobody. He didnt leave the house for weeks. He doesnt want to talk to me on the phone, he doesnt wanna go out, he didnt even come to my graduation.. My mom is of no help since she is just ""mad that he doesnt help around the house""

&amp;#x200B;

The big question is.. what to do? I can recommend a therapist but since he doesnt have a car he will never go there. My parents live 1 hour drive from me so I can't look after him as much as I wish. How to talk to him? Help

All you do is what makes you happy, when you doing something for someone else your just doing it to feel good about yourself.
Fuck it. I’m just going to be who I truly am.

In my counseling recently, it came up that because we spent nearly all our time together previously, I'm still looking to her for all those links that just aren't there right now.

As my therapist put it, ""you need to diversify"".

So, ok.. I need to, I want to, but... how to? I'm making progress on handling inattentive - adhd, and my depression is mostly under control. Making friends, connections in my 30's seems just bonkers.

88,"I’m pushing people away and I don’t know how or why I’m doing this. I moved away for University and now all I do is sit in my room alone. At first I made new friends and what not and now I have no one.

I’ve pushed away all the people in my building. I can’t afford to go out drinking so I stopped going to places when they invited me. I’m ont acquaintances with the people on my course. They’re all lovely people but no one messages me or talks to me outside of class. And half the time I can barely get out of bed to go to class. 

I was dating someone but eventually I realised it wasn’t going to work out and that it wasn’t healthy for me so I broke up with him. I don’t talk to him now either so. 

My only proper friend can be absolutely awful and makes me feel worse. She travels a lot and so I don’t really see her either. And then today one of my online friends asked me if I still wanted to be friends and it hit me so hard. 

This is only a small part of the rest of my mental health but I hate it. I don’t know how to resume being friends with people or make new ones. And sitting alone in my room watching other people enjoy their lives together doesn’t exactly make me feel any better. ",10Mar2019,2

In 2004, Donald Trump did an interview with Howard Stern.  At the time, he was 57 years old.  The topic of Lindsay Lohan came up in the conversation.  At the time she was 18, almost 19, and going through an extreme mental health crisis.  The conversation is directly quoted as follows:

*""Can you imagine the sex with this troubled teen?"" said Stern.

""Yeah, you're probably right,"" Trump said. ""She's probably deeply troubled and therefore great in bed. How come the deeply troubled women, you know, deeply, deeply troubled, they're always the best in bed?""*

The future president also stated that while emotionally disturbed women are great in bed, they aren’t the kind of women to pursue relationships with.  In other words, fuck them and dump them.  A powerful rich man then dancing the fine line between middle age and senior citizen said this about a teenager and no one batted an eyelash.  

No one ever wonders what it’s like trying to find love when you’re a woman with a mental illness.  No one ever questions whether or not we are worth more than this puerile and base attitude.  How do we find what we deserve when we are viewed as less than whole people, when what we are primarily seen as is disposable receptacles for ejaculate?  The crazy girl isn’t built for relationships.  At least, according to everyone who isn’t a crazy girl, she isn’t.

How common is this attitude?  Despite the above interview being transcribed and available publicly for over a decade, it was never once mentioned by the press or his opponents during the 2016 election cycle.  Defending the essential and fundamental humanity of a young girl with a mental illness wasn’t even worthy of mention.  

Men are taught that mental illness makes you weak.  Women are taught that mental illness makes you broken goods.  We are no longer whole, complete creatures.  We are less than.  We are the stereotype of a woman with PMS times a thousand.  

Why do men like crazy chicks so much?  Because it’s so much easier to use, manipulate, and throw away stereotypes than it is people you see as whole and complete.  

I have a mental illness.  Yes.  But I still both desire and am worthy of both loving and being loved in return.  My mental illness is not a reflection of the fundamental worth I have as a person.  It does nothing to detract from it.  What’s more, I believe, quite firmly, that instead of distracting from my fundamental worth, it has enhanced it.  I believe it has helped me learn to be more compassionate as I understand the tough times all too well.  

Yes, there was a time when my behavior was considerably more controlled by my mental illnesses than it is now.  Primarily the behavioral issues were triggered by extreme anxiety.  It’s not as though age has ended those issues either.  It’s that I intentionally avoid my triggers for the most part.  Loud and crowded places rarely are graced by my presence any more.  But then they were. 
 
I was a young woman, terrified by life, desperate to find a place, no matter how small, no matter how temporary that just felt safe.  That was all I wanted.  I wanted to feel safe.  Even now, there are times when I find it difficult to spend time in my living room.  I live alone, save for a gigantic idiot of a dog.  But even with that, the living room feels too public, too open, too scary.  In the tough times, I don’t just stay in bed because bed is unbelievably comfortable.  I stay because it’s sometimes the only place that feels safe.

95,"I've got it down pat when it comes to getting help with my physical health but have no idea how to get help with my mental. Is it like basically the same process? I know I can Google this info but I wanna seek help for multiple things so I don't even know where to start. I live in the United States and I have Medicaid. I can't afford to pay anything out of pocket right now. 

If it's relevant, I wanna seek help for the abuse I endured as a child. This was everything from watching my siblings beat my mom on a daily basis, sometimes to unconsciousness, to getting raped by my mom's boyfriend and my brother. Both only on one occasion. My mom was basically never sober growing up and I think that took a toll on me too. My dad was never present and I never had a father figure that lasted more than a few months. My mom just went from man to man and told me each new one is my dad. 

I also wanna seek help for an abusive relationship I got into as a teen. I let it take way more out of me than it should have. It's embarrassing that I had so little self respect that I allowed it to go on for so long, but I'm starting to suspect he was a narcissist. He wore my worth down on purpose, was emotionally abusive (and physically in some ways), and cheated on me throughout the length of the relationship. It lasted from when I was 13 to when I was 18. I kept trying to leave but he would threaten to kill himself every time. He pushed all my friends away and isolated me by telling them I was abusive to him, not the other way around.

I lost so much to him. I can no longer feel love. My current boyfriend treats me like a princess but I seem to have an inability to feel love anymore. It's like when someone tells me they love me, I don't feel anything. It feels like a lie again, because that kinda thing was lied about for so long to me. Anytime someone shows affection or appreciation for me I can never take it as genuine. It just feels like they're saying it through some obligation to say it and it isn't real. But I'm so starved for love. It's like someone putting a big juicy steak in front of me and I can feel myself drooling, I want it so bad, but I'm not gonna eat it because what if its poisoned? So I appreciate the effort, I appreciate that it's there, but ultimately I don't benefit from it through no fault of anyone else's. 

I don't know what my goal would be in seeking mental help. I wanna uncover some suppressed memories of things from my childhood. (I only recently got exposed to the fact that my brother assaulted me again because I overheard he and my mom screaming over it. So I don't know what all happened. I remember my mom's boyfriend, however.) I also wanna be able to feel and accept love as passionately as I used to. I wanna not hate myself anymore. But I don't know how that can be achieved. A diagnosis of some sort? Medication? I don't fucking know. I just wanna feel better again. 

So, where can I even start? I only have a little less than a year before Medicaid won't accept me anymore and I can't afford health insurance unless things look up for me between now and then. ",10Mar2019,1
96,"So I’ve had pretty bad social anxiety for most of my life. Whenever I get to know someone and I feel comfortable around them, I have no problem acting as myself. However, around strangers or people I don’t know very well, I’m generally a very quiet and reserved person. I hate this about myself.

I’ve tried therapy before, but I generally find it pretty useless. I’ve got a great core of very supportive friends and family who I can always talk to, and I tend to talk to them about my problems. However, this has never done anything to help my anxiety. 

I’ve been researching prescription benzodiazepines for a while. I know it’s generally more useful to combine a prescription drug with therapy, but I’m starting to wonder if it would help me. I know it may not be a great justification for this prescription, but whenever I drink even a little bit, my social anxiety melts away. This has created some awkward situations where someone who met a talkative, relaxed me at a party has been confused why sober me barely talks to them the next day. If anyone is wondering, I wouldn’t describe myself as an alcoholic, as I only drink socially once or twice a week. I can certainly have fun with my friends without having to drink, but I don’t always feel the same way about people I’m not close with. 

Finally, I feel like I should mention that I  am an engineering major at a strenuous university. I’m doing quite well, but I know that benzodiazepines can have a negative effect on memory and cognition. I have a feeling I could still do well, but I can’t know for sure. 

I just need some advice from others - I realize I should talk to a doctor or psychiatrist about this, but a second opinion from y’all couldn’t hurt. ",10Mar2019,1

102," Some context:  I don't think this has anything to do with mental illness but this sub seems most suitable.

Being the dumb little shit i am , i got the app the person was using, and deposited $10 which i ended up losing. It doesn't seem like a big deal to most people but i have a tendency to get extremely angry over the smallest of things , for weeks . I feel stupid for spending money like that, and expressed my anger in the form of petty edgy rants and death threats(not towards them) in my friend's groupchat . It riled everyone up due to mass confusion and some were threatening to call the police/left. I know i have no one to blame except myself but i can't stop feeling pissed.  I'm already in a tight spot for money and yet i spend it so recklessly like a fucking idiot.  I don't want to blame this on mental illness or drug use(??????) , I'm not trying to justify how i reacted, but i can't just suddenly stop feeling angry, admit i'm wrong, even if i did there's nothing i can do to make them feel better.   I apologised to them but the damage is done. I',m not expecting them to forgive me, it just really upsets me that i'm like this???  I feel like i deserve to be punished for reacting this way but there's a part of me refusing to accept that i did something wrong, face the consequences, and move on with it.  Pretty fucking pathetic how mad i get from losing $10.   This has been bothering me for the past 6 hours, i fucking hate myself for harming my relationships over losing fucking $10.  

I thought that if i can't get my money back i'd at least let the others know it's a bs scam. i made a nasty comment on the scammer's post (group admin is dead, can't report) and got myself zucced immediately for using the s word. Now ican't message anyone about the scam and my comment isn't there. Trying to do something productive while i'm angry just fuels it even more.  Why am i a such a dumbass doing shit without thinking?????  I keep repeating the same mistake there's nothing i can do to calm myself when i'm pissed, i want something to be done, like that middle aged mom who yells at the subway employee. I Dont care about the money at this point i just want to take everything back and pretend it never happened but i cant.

104,"I hope someone finds this who can relate; I know it can feel good just knowing that you are not the only one who suffers in a similar way.

When I was 21, I went to a therapist. She asked me why I'm  not applying for jobs. I said ""they would find someone better than me anyway"". When I got a job that I was kind of forced to apply to, I thought I will be fired in about a week or two. I had insane anxiety about it, I cried, I couldn't sleep, I hated everything. I managed to work for almost a year and I was never fired, I quit. 

But I still think that everyone would be able to do any job better than me. Yup, let's say 80 year old who has never seen a computer and not interested to learn would be better suited for making powerpoint presentations than me. I seriously do think that. I realize the absurdity. But I can't change this belief. I think that other people have something I don't have. Something related to people-skills. I believe that people are much more understanding and lenient to others than me because they have these people-skills. 

And to an extent, this could be true. A talkative, positive person will have an easier time at work than a just as competent quiet, anxious person. But to think that because of that literally anyone would be better at any job than me is riciculous, right?

My low self-esteem mainly centers around jobs, and authority in general. I feel like I'm bothering people and that I'm annoying. I feel like people like cashiers, bus drivers, doctors, etc. are rude to me even when they are probably not. I often feel like crying after these interactions. There are a lot of things I can do that don't trigger my low self-esteem, but lately my low self-esteem has negatively impacted my relationship with my boyfriend too. My boyfriend is currently attending college. I have never went to college because of my low self-esteem and anxiety, and even if I wanted to go, I wouldn't have had the money. But I feel like a failiure. Every time he is talking about college-related stuff, I feel awful knowing that I never attended nor could I ever attend college.

&amp;#x200B;

So, why do I have low self esteem? 

I was always a quiet, very introverted person growing up. I have never really learned social skills because of my anxiety, and I didn't want to talk to people anyway. My mom is naturally a talkative person, and she has never had a problem with this, and she didn't/couldn't help. Because of that, I was always confused about people, couldn't interpret them, and that could have somehow contributed to this.

I was also never encouraged to do anything, really. My mom never talked to me once about college, or what job I want after school. After high school ended, she was just demanding that I work somewhere to get money. 

Not talking about these kind of things really could have severerly negatively impacted me. Oh, and school. One of my teachers straight up told me that I will never go to college. Yup. I'm not even sure why. I was quiet, never made any trouble of course, and I had reasonable grades. But I guess she disliked me for some reason. For years I didn't feel like this negatively impacted my self-esteem, only now I feel like this could be another reason I feel this way about myself. Not getting encouragement, just one discouragement from authority figures can't be good for mental health. 

Another big thing that could have caused this, mainly later in life, is my mom not valuing my time. I can never be busy. I always have to get up right away and help her in whatever she needs. She also always took nearly all my money when I worked a normal job. Basically devauling me to be just a resource really can't be good for self-esteem. I only recently just realized that hey, I work from home now, I can't be expected to stop doing what I'm doing in 0.1 seconds every time she desires, without warning. And I'm just now realizing that even when I didn't have a job, it was still devaluing. The first time I said to her that 'I'm busy', after asking me for help with something, was only a few weeks ago, and she reacted as I expected: yelling. (I later asked her why is she expecting me to give her money if she doesn't let me work, she had no answer to that.)

From my childhood, there must be a million different things I long forgot that caused this. I don't think I can ever understand, even partially, what happened in my childhood. Which is funny because that's why I started writing this post in the first place. I guess general neglect is a part of it, for sure. 

I literally have no idea how will I ever come out of this. I have never been out of it. 

Thank you all for listening.

109,"This guy is an ex boyfriend of mine. While we were dating he sexually harassed me alot and sexually assaulted me a few times (though i didnt see it like that back then, he did sexual things to me even when I said no, and even when he thought I was asleep)

I broke up with him and we became friends again. Enter friend number 2. Friend 2 has seriously been lusting after Ex for 2 years, its kind of gross sometimes. Long story short Ex and Friend 2 tried to get me so tired one night that i wouldnt be in the right mind to answer things and would participate in a sexual threesome roleplay with them (they had asked me to do this multiple times and i had said no because it made me very uncomfortable). I acted like I didnt know their plan, and it didnt work anyways, but later I confronted Friend 2 about it saying I felt like she tried to manipulate me into doing sexual things and that just isnt okay. Basically she said that Ex pressured her to do it (even though I had seen her come up with the idea) and blamed the whole thing on Ex. I forgave her and quit communications with Ex.

The thing is, despite Friend 2 blaming the situation on Ex, she refuses to accept that he should take any sort of responsibility for it. This is where mental health comes into play.

This dude gives me really bad anxiety now. Whenever I'm around him I start shaking and almost cry. Sometimes I throw up (i throw up when i get bad anxiety because of past bulemic tendencies). Friend 2 continues to hang around Ex which means I can barely ever talk to her outside texting. She keeps inviting me to things Ex is at knowing that I don't want to be around him.  I have tried to stop being around him before, but I ended up forcing myself to be friends with him again just so Friend 2 wouldn't be so awkward around me and I could actually hang out with her. I fear that will happen again. I fear she'll never get over him and never see him for who he truly is and I'll never get him out of my life. I don't want to abandon Friend 2.

Hi Everyone! I would love to share my recent experience and get your opinions.

This crazy story starts when I realized that WiFi caused my teeth clenching at night (daily jaw pain). I forgot my night guard on a trip once, stayed in a hotel that didn't have WiFi and was surprised when I woke up with no jaw pain! I then turned my WiFi router off at home and my night clenching got so much better. I had figured out that for me, WiFi was causing a physiological effect - at night at least.

CURRENT ISSUE: I just started a job where I will need to work from a 'tech' room, lots of WiFi, lots of electronic devices. I got concerned: ""Oh no! What if the room is filled with so much WiFi and electromagnetic fields? What if it's bad for my health or worse, I get symptoms during work? Fast forward to when I started to be around this room for just a little bit, prior to my job new job start date, I started to get strong brain fog when in the room or even looking at the door! This was for short stints of 2-25 mins.

Now that work as started, I've spent a full week in the room and whenever I am there I have full brain fog. My anxiety is high and I am tense.

My anxiety mind says: 'See, you are reacting negatively to all the dangerous EMF &amp; WiFi'.

My rational mind says: 'Nope, you are manifesting anxiety through a symptom of brain fog. The room might have higher EMFs but it won't give you any symptoms if your only there for 8 hours a day and you don't sit feet from the WiFi routers etc.'

Interesting enough when I was in this room prior to knowing I would work there I had zero brain fog. Did I create this fake symptom? Do I just need to ignore it, be productive until it fades away? I am a bit of a health a nutrition freak so I would worry about this more than the average person.",10Mar2019,1

123,"I am bipolar and my wife is not. This is more narrative than advice but it might give you an idea of what it takes.

She is the only person in my life who lives it with me. She’s the only person who sees the meltdowns, the sulking, the searing depression. She knows of the months of my nothingness. She knows the inside of our local VA psych ward. She’s heard my screams of insanity. She knows I’m hard to live with.

But she has learned my dance. She lifts and sways and tilts with me every single day. At times she applies pressure to me or resists my sway, but only to correct me or instruct me. She keeps me eating, sleeping and going to therapy. She documents changes in medication.

After my breakthrough manic episode, I had been told I was bipolar and simply couldn’t accept it. I lived the next three years in a cage within my own mind. A cage of shame. I was totally and completely by myself. I drank and ate and slept under the bell jar. Even when depression lifted I couldn’t go more than a moment in conversation without thinking about how insane I am and whether or not I was blending in with the other humans.

I’m not sure exactly how I went from that place to the dance of love but I’m not alone anymore. She’s the only one who is with me in the trenches. She can’t climb into my mind and change my thoughts, but she can keep me fighting a battle of moderation and peacefulness. She buys me books on bipolar disorder and listens to a podcast about mental illness every day. After hospitalizations she checks beneath my tongue to make sure I really took my pills. She knows more of my story than anyone else.

After my latest mania I told her I am sorta two different people when I’m low and when I’m high. One is humble and kind and anxious. The other is sort of a cowboy. Both are fully me but both are very different. The first is depressed and thoughtful. The other is hypomanic and remembers real well he was a Navy SEAL. One reads quietly in his room for hours. The other is likely to be out losing money at the blackjack tables. I told her I don’t always know who is going to wake up that morning. A “middle me”, a bookworm, or a gambler. Can you imagine living with someone like this? I can’t. My wife does it because she’s a badass.

I also have to be honest with myself that if we have kids I might encounter times where I am hospitalized or cooped up in my room from depression. Luckily I chose someone who I am confident can handle any task or issue thrown her way. Bipolar people have a hard time taking care of themselves sometimes. It isn’t reasonable to rely on them as a caretaker for others every moment of every day. If you want the real take, I truly struggle at feeding myself, going to bed, keeping clean clothes and organizing my space.

When I met my wife I had just landed a job as a kayak instructor and was being paid in tips essentially. I lived on a sailboat with debt, a sizable amount of debt. My car constantly broke down and I paid for our first date on a credit card I didn’t have money to pay off. I’ve come so far because of her. I’ve figured out how to structure my life in a way that tasks seem doable. She is my compass and my stars. And on top of that she works with kids who have special needs every single day. On my own, even with savings, I would be on the streets within a couple years. She has enabled me to keep a job, to explore passion projects, to pay the mortgage every month, to keep dry cleaned shirts and fresh socks, and most importantly to allow myself to like who I am right now.

Our relationship is uneven. Her hands are constantly busy while mine sit idly twirling a spliff. Brass tax: it isn’t a fair setup. She does more for me than I do for her. If you are mentally ill, find someone with that capacity. Someone who will fight harder for you than you can for yourself at times. Someone who takes notes while the doctors talk. A person who brings you to tears when they visit you in the psych ward. I’ll never forget what it was like when my wife visited my in the psychiatric ward. In that moment I knew I would get through it. We were ride together, die together type of people. Her fierce loyalty held me together in times of tragic pain. We might have felt underwater at times, but the one thing we knew is that we weren’t letting go of each other.

Being the crazy one it’s easy become that attached. Finding someone who will stay that attached to you is an entirely different story. Being married to me is like becoming a Navy SEAL relationally. My training was just like it in fact. Often cold, sleepless nights, unending exertion, little appreciation. And that’s just the training to marry me. Once you get the job it’s constant stress and worry and heartbreak. I disappoint, I just do.

My wife however is unphased. She rolls with the storm like a weathered ship’s captain, unafraid of the breaking waves. She wakes before me and goes to bed after me. She makes print out charts and tapes them to my mirror so I can track my mood and sleep. She does it without pay and without complaint. She let’s me leave social events early and always make sure I’m not overwhelmed in any setting. Emotionally, she’s built like a tank.

She’s the only one who gets through to me when I’m manic. She can speak to me without speaking in that setting. She brings me art supplies and encourages my creative efforts, knowing that it centers me. She discusses openly just how bipolar I am and how equally proud she is of me. She has made her family more comfortable with my disorder than my own family is. She encourages me to indulge when it seems appropriate and opposes me when I am over the line.

When I was being cuffed, kicking and screaming in the streets, it was her name on my lips. I knew if she was there then I would be ok. It takes a lot for me to be ok. Can you tell I rely on her yet? As I write this she’s gone for the night and I mostly wander around the dark condo, fumbling around aimlessly until she returns. It’s the best moment in my day when I hear her keys unlock the front door. She is my muse and my goddess. I no longer fully exist without her.

She holds me when I have night terrors. She holds me when I’m depressed. She holds me when I’m psychotic and so terribly confused. She holds me on the good days too, because even those can be hard for me. Up to half of those living with bipolar disorder attempt suicide. Just existing in this state is arduous.

So you want to marry someone with bipolar? It can be magical, but it will be tough as shit. You better be someone who will break down the gates of hell for those you love before even considering marrying a person like me. Statistically most marriages in this country already end in divorce. The odds don’t get better when you throw manic depressives into the mix. It’s possible, but you better be someone who is exceptional.

126,"Ok, i've been puzzled by some things lately. But i don't know whether it is related to mental health issues or what.

Let me start by explaining what kind of lifestyle i have because i've heard that is significant. I don't have a lot of social intereactions. I sit alone in the darkness of my room most of the time playing video games all the time except for when i go to work. I don't go outside at all because i've never seen a reason to. I'm basically living a double life. 50% work and 50% in my room.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't quite know how to write this. I've been starting to think about a lot of things. Things in which i never thought i would get into. Things that may or may not be considered taboo.

These thoughts have over time started to become more violent. And for some reason whenever i think about them, my heart starts beating like crazy, and then i get some form of adrenaline rush that makes me super excited. I don't know if it's sexual. But it's enough to spark a curiousity.

Many of the thoughts involves knives, torture and executions. It's so surreal too. Almost like visions in my head.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never been diagnosed with anything. I used to be depressed back at high school, but i got the impression it was normal, so i didn't go to the doctor. It was a bad time. I had problems eating, and even considered suicide. But eventually i got over it. I did notice a feeling of emptiness and hollowness for some time after the depression though. Almost as if something died emotionally in me.

131,"Sorry if this is long...

Last April I started therapy and also started seeing a psychiatrist last summer. I was diagnosed with ""general mood disorder"" and was put on lamictal for that. I was also put on seroquel for *sleep* and an anxiety med. I stopped the lamictal after a month with no changes.  I had been begging to be put on an ADHD medication because It hadn't been medicated in 15 years. I fought hard to be put on one...and then i was put in cymbalta for it.

The psychiatrist didn't warn me of any of the nasty af side effects associated with it. I've yet to find anyone else with ADHD being treated with cymbalta. However, I have found many people whom had nasty side effects on it and coming off of it. 

I stopped the seroquel last month before going into the hospital for surgery. It put me to sleep but I dont stay asleep. I have been having terrible night sweats and terrors since about Aug and wondered if it was that. It wasn't. Turns out it may be the cymbalta and the shrink didn't mention it when I told her months ago about the night sweats.


My wife went to my appointment on Friday with me and was blown away by how shitty this doctor is. When I mentioned that I'm still smoking as much weed as I have been even with all these medications her response was ""what's the issue with that?"".  Why would I continue taking pills if they're not helping?  I dont want to just smoke to be baseline. I'd love to actually get high and enjoy it.

There's very shitty limited mental health care where. I live. Even my and my wifes therapists have no good suggestions for psychiatrists.

I'm positive that she's a borderline, but am not clear on whether she's been diagnosed as such. If so, she ran from the diagnosis, thus is untreated as one.

I literally landed on Reddit today after having Googled: ""adult siblings with mental illness"". While there is endless material, I found very little to sink my teeth into. Most of what I read was too general to be of any value and largely un-enlightening.

140,"So back in December 2018 my old manager was very nicely giving me a lift home because I was probably having the worst migraine of my life. He said it wasn't safe for me to be in the office if I can barely walk or see, knowing that I'd probably walk into the factory across the road at some point during the day. 

During this ride home we got talking about mental health (I suffer with really bad depression and anxiety and he served in the military for a few years). During our conversation he was saying that he's seen some shit while in the military which triggered his depression (which was fair enough I thought) and then he all of a sudden turned to me and said ""what's your excuse?"" I was shocked. 

I thought we were having a nice open conversation about mental health but this is not what I was expecting. 

I asked him what he meant and he just replied with ""what's your ""excuse"" for your depression?"" with air quotes and all. I gave him my full life story. I lost my dad at a young age (I was about 4 years old), I was violently abused from the age of 6 till I was about 11, then I was kicked out at 19, lost my nan (my dad's mum), made redundant from my first job and my granddad (mums dad) was locked up ALL IN THE SAME WEEK! 

All I got was an ""oh that's it? That doesn't seem like a good enough excuse. I served in the military for X number of years and I've seen some shit. Wanna know how I got out of my depression? I grew a pair. I didn't see the point in being depressed""
All I could say is that I'll take that advice and give it a go. 

My manager was gatekeeping mental health and basically told me that I have no fucking reason to be depressed or anxious. 
Nothing hurts more than opening up to someone that you think you can trust just for them to tell you that you have no reason to be depressed and to just get over it. 

I thought this was going to be a conversation where two adults bond a little over experiences, not a conversation about why I should or shouldn't be depressed. 
I just said to him ""I don't need a reason to be depressed. Just like there's no reason to why we get a common cold"" and just sat in silence the rest of the way home. ",10Mar2019,3

(15 years retail office experience, accounting qualification etc) I couldn't answer her without telling her my mental woes. 

So I just- 🤷‍♀️

Come last week, she chucked me in front of a computer, handed me some paperwork and told me what to do. Within a week a had proved myself and have moved up the ranks.

143,"I’ve been in remission for a year and seven months. No symptoms. For me it’s a milestone that I never thought I would achieve, let alone live to see, but it’s quite a difference on the other side of the fence, it feels like my mind is in the midst of complete silence and I can finally steer my sails in the right direction. My life no longer involves functioning inside of a tornado that never ends. I can see in full color. I notice all of the intricate details in life again, and for once, I wake up and I look forward to the day.

Despite all of this though, I’m not always ok. I’ve been left with this mess of a mind and it’s hard to navigate through it all. Some days I feel like I’m on the right track and other days I feel like I don’t know what I’m doing at all. I get lost inside my head and I get frustrated because I can’t figure myself out. Sometimes I get angry for the moments where I wasn’t in control, the memories where I can truly measure the force that is manic-depression. It’s heartbreaking when I think of how much I lost. It makes me feel guilty. And often it breaks me down because this wasn’t what I had in store for my life.

I receded into myself, and now that it’s over I’m tasked with figuring out what the hell I’ve been doing for the last ten years. I don’t feel like I’m in a crisis but I feel like I’m in shock. Where do I go now that I’ve become present within myself? The lights have been turned back on and I still I feel like I’m roaming around in the dark. I use literature and self-help books, online courses, meditation, and a plethora of other resources trying to find a path for myself. But it seems like I tend to go in circles, despite the world moving forward without me. I feel like I've been left behind.

I never pictured what 29 would look like, but I had to make the decision to find a way through this sickness. I want to say I don’t know what motivated me, but I do know. It was the hunger for something beyond myself. I like to think that I have a pretty good mind despite my mental illness. I know I’m not cured and I never expected that outcome. Whether I like it or not, bipolar disorder is a part of my identity. I've learned to appreciate myself because of it.

It’s hard to look back at my life though, and see where my choices, confounded with my disorder, led me down some bad narratives. I look in the mirror and I apologize to myself for the all the years I didn’t care. For all of the things I could’ve done, the friends I could’ve made, the places I’d have under my belt, and perhaps love that’s still waiting out there. It hurts. It hurts deeply. Now, I glance backward in quiet observance. I no longer ask why it happened, I simply observe my choices and that gives me all of the answers that I need. I’m a guidebook to myself.

If you’re maintaining any type of sanity inside this disorder understand that you’re brave. It’s ok if the days knock you down and you have a hard time finding your way back up. It’s ok if you can’t quite find the right words say that you love yourself. It’s ok if it all becomes too much and you have to retreat into the background. You’re not perfect. I’m not perfect. What I really mean with all of this is that it’s ok if you’re not ok, because I’m not ok either.

144,"I'm really sad and don't know what to do. I need to get a lot off my chest, please help me. 

I'm a 19 year old male from the UK. I live with my parents and 18 year old brother, I have two older sisters too, as well as quite a few pets. My last grandparent died when I was aged 12. My mother has one sister but she lives in Australia so we only see her and my cousins, who have children, once every few years. I hardly know them at all. My dad has one brother, who lives about 2 hours away, but we haven't spoken to him or any of his family since my Nanna died; they aren't very nice people. 

So I don't have a very big family, outside of those I live with. My parents are aged 52 and 65, which may sound a little weird but they love each other dearly. My dad is young at heart. He is always busy  fixing things or doing house work. I love him, he's so caring and thoughtful, and we are close, but I've never been as close with him as I have with my mum. I only began to realise as I got older but it's just harder to talk about some things with my dad. I think it's because I'm gay. We don't joke around like a lot of father/son relationships do. Perhaps because I don't like football or girls. I don't know, it's strange. He doesn't really say 'I love you' either but I know he does. I think that's because he is quite shy himself and struggles to open up. I'm close with my mum. Although we don't talk about love interests or anything like that at all. I haven't told her I'm gay either, but I feel like they both know at this point. She struggled herself with depression when she was younger and still has very bad health anxiety. 

Neither of them ever had any friends, just each other. They never really did anything for themselves. For the last 20 odd years that has been what they have done. Looked after us and nothing but us. This is amazing, but it has also impacted be dramatically. I'm 19. My childhood was very uneventful. Don't get me wrong, we had some great holidays every year, but when I look back I don't remember much. I was very quiet, never had a single genuine friendship all the way up through to the age of 18. I played the trumpet for a while and went horse riding for a year, but quit that once I lost interest. Never took part in any clubs or activities, just stayed at home, on my laptop. Playing games. Year after year after year. My parents saw me having fun on my laptop and left it at that. They never pushed me to do more because they didn't want me to do anything I didn't want to. This has made me dependent. Socially-lacking. Boring. Lazy. Sad. 

I was quite bright in school. Not exceptional, but I had potential. I massively regret the subjects I chose to study as they didn't interest me, they were just the easiest option or the subjects others had decided to study. My dad did help me a lot though and helped me achieve decent grades. I turned 18 and had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, full of insecurity and had no direction whatsoever. I didn't go to university and, I suppose, this is where my mental health really took a turn for the worse. I didn't care when growing up, because I was young and had so much time ahead of me. I never thought about the time I was wasting looking at the same old screen or how much regret I would have about missing out on every social aspect of childhood.  But now it hit me, and although I now understood, I never did anything about it. And it didn't get any better. 

My days would consist of waking up, masturbating, showering, eating whatever my mum had made me and watching videos on my laptop, with the occasional night out. Repeat. I never, ever exercised and felt incredibly unconfident in my skinny-fat body. I began to hook up with random men. I lost my first kiss to an older, scruffy man when I was drunk off my face and, although I've never had sex, I have done several other things with strangers. I would, and still regularly, sext men online and it makes me feel disgusting, slutty and ashamed. I regularly went out with the one and only friend I had kept in contact with from college and her friends, perhaps every other weekend, drinking and partying. I loved it, I enjoyed feeling so confident but it was just temporary. I eventually got a job six months later as a cashier in a shop, working every now and again when they needed me. It gave me some purpose but I still continued to do nothing else. I had told myself I would not go to uni and instead work on developing myself. Make lots of new friends, get into shape, go travelling, volunteer, learn a new language or instrument, become independent, pick up some new skills, figure out what I want to do with my life... Be happy.. but I hadn't done any of that. 

But I wasn't happy. I'm still not happy. The next September came around and I was still just as clueless so I didn't go to uni again. I have stayed in the shop, doing the same things. My body is exactly the same, I hate it. No language or instrument learnt, no new skills. I'm still addicted to porn and masturbating, even addicted to tinder, seeking attention. No new friends, feeling really lonely. I've continued to get wasted every weekend, this time in a city about an hour away where my one friend is at uni. I still hook up with a different guy every night I go there. My family have no idea. I haven't told my friend I'm gay, we still only really socialise when we are drinking. I'm not embarrassed to be gay, It's just hard. I think my brother is gay too but we don't talk about anything like that. 

My OCD has gotten a lot better, I now touch doorhandles, don't have to eat sandwiches with a knife and fork and aren't as paranoid. My parents say I have came a long way over the last year or so, but I don't see it. I haven't done anything I said I was going to. I always compare myself to people on social media, they're living amazing lives and here I am, wasting time, but I never do anything about it. I'm so lazy and unmotivated, I hate myself. I've applied to university for this September because I think I'll regret it if I don't try it. Despite feeling more ready than the previous two years,  I still have many doubts. The uni is in the city where my friend lives, an hour away, which I've already experienced. I don't know if I want to commit the next 3 years of my life to living there. Or anywhere for that matter. The course isn't overly interesting. I've been trying to find the perfect uni and course but can't do so. I'm not excited to go even, I'm just desperate to get away from whatever I'm feeling now.

I don't want to continue like this. Most nights I cry myself to sleep. I try to stay positive, telling myself we all take different paths in life, that I shouldn't compare myself to others, that I am so lucky to even be alive, that I can push through this. But... I don't know if I can. I hate my life. I've always hated my life. I've wasted so much time. There is so much wrong with my life. Why aren't I fixing anything? I would do anything to start again. I just want to be happy. 

I expected so much more from life..

I really don't want to die but I don't know what else to do. 

Please help me

145,"G'day all,

I'm 31, male, living in Sydney.  So I've been struggling for a while with my mental health, which is I suppose why we're all on this sub. But I finally went to a GP to bring up how I was feeling and she recommended meds and a mental health plan, which in Australia is 10 free sessions with a psych. 

What has me really worried is the side effects of meds, both physiologically and the social impact - as in the way it will affect some jobs. Sertraline is what she recommended and the list is pretty upsetting to be honest. That, and I was a former soldier and am currently considering rejoining because I miss it so much - but the defence force would definitely not allow me to return if I went down that route. And before anyone suggests that the mental health is a priority, sometimes I think the lack of purpose and job satisfaction is the cause of it. So, catch 22. 

On that, there are a whole host of other personal issues with my life right now that, were I satisfied with I wonder if I'd even be in this situation. 

-My education doesn't match what people think is my intelligence at all, which can be annoying when people (particularly employers) think you're from a really well set up background and you're actually a housing commission kid who ran away from home and didn't finish school. I'm working on it - volunteering at a radio station and have uni apps in. 
- My job is in hospitality which means late nights, surrounded by booze and all the ills that go with it. 
- I've just gone through a pretty shattering breakup - my fault - and have some uncertainty around my living situation as a result. 
- I've just quit smoking which is great for financial and health reasons, but it might be a while til I feel the impact of both.
- I don't drink much but could definitely cut it out as a test. Same as above.
- I've started going to the beach at least once a week, like really long walks and a swim, then a walk back and sleep like a baby. Again, a recent change that I think in the long run will be great. 



All of these are really tangible problems or very recent lifestyle changes that, were they solved, I'm not sure I'd even be seeking help. Has anyone gone on a mental health plan in Australia that didn't involve meds?

146,"I'm in first year of university, and I recently got a very terrible score on a midterm when the median was very high. I usually don't get such low scores compared to the average and this made me very sad. I had no excuse for it because I wasted so much of my time on useless things like YouTube and League of Legends. Even though I try so hard every time to not do it when I am not doing it I can't focus. I've improved a little but then I soon fall back into my bad habits. I just feel so terrible and I know if I keep going down this path I'll eventually fail. I often wish I was never born and I Just don't know where else to talk about this. Sorry if I wasted your time.",10Mar2019,1
147,"For years my mom has exhibited signs of mental illness. I’m not sure which one.

She flips out out of nowhere (she will literally be napping, wake up, and start screaming at my father and I). She overreacts to minor stressors. She sleeps more hours than normal. She’s either been fired from or left every job in the past 10 years because she doesn’t get along with the boss, doesn’t like the commute, the people are mean to her, etc etc. In those 10 years, she’s never held a job longer than a year.

Her brother has bipolar disorder. I don’t know if she does too, but she has something.

Anyway. I’m usually tolerant, but at some point, her irrationality makes me snap and I always end up screaming at her to get help. Then again, I’ve also tried to tell her calmly that she needs help. Either way, she gets nasty, tells me I’m a child (I’m 25), tells me to stop talking to her like that. She just threw a chair at me and called me a cunt. We just got a new puppy and she had a meltdown over the stress... it’s been here 24 hrs. She doesn’t know how to channel or cope with her emotions.

I don’t know how to get her help. My father is a helpless bystander. He doesn’t know what to do, either.

Advice, please. We’re at our wit’s end.",10Mar2019,1
148,"Since around the age of five, I've had constant strange mood swings (example: in 10 minutes randomly going from fine, to highly aggressive, to breaking down even in a situation where nothing that would cause that is happening). I never really cared because it didn't impact me much, but now my antisocial self is getting back into talking to people and I'm realizing this ruining many close relationships and I have 0 control over it.

150,"My wonderful friend, I’ll call him John. Even when I first met John I always thought he exhibited some mild symptoms of some sort of psychological illness. Constant random outbursts, not being able to stay on topic of conversation, short attention span. Extremely argumentative, over inquisitive paranoia (asking a million questions when asked to do something, or told something, as if what was said had malicious intent behind it). He’s always been very shut in about his life, feeling, etc. Seemed depressed, always thinking about something. Those sorts of things don’t seem too outrageous. But there were other things he would do that made me wonder. Crazy stories of meeting famous (and even dead) celebrities. He would often talk of being watched or that there were cameras watching him. He nicknamed me Vin Diesel. In the last he would sometimes talk to inanimate objects, I remember specifically, when we were at a park, he was picking individual blades of grass and talking to them. His random outbursts and off topic comments were also sometimes at a more worrisome level. (Right now I’m typing this to him and he just had another - “I just learned how to hack, do you need a hack.” I wasn’t even talking to him at all) Another sign, that I let off-put me, is his extreme sarcasm, mixed with superior intelligence. His sarcasm is unbelievably smart, but nagging and annoying. It’s constant, he sometimes annoys me and other people by constantly being sarcastic and snobby, included with the outbursts and such. It feels almost like he would be purposely doing it just because of the sarcastic and snobby remarks following his behavior. He’s a very intelligent guy. Intelligent in another way, it’s not able to be put in words how meeting him has changed my views on communication and interactions. He even went to college (although he was kicked out for reasons he won’t tell me). In the beginning stages of our friendship I was always worried about why he acted so strange. But over time, as I began to realize how smart he was, I passed off his behavior as him just loving to irritate people and confuse them. I truly didn’t believe someone this smart could have a psychological illness. I felt bad about thinking he did, and moved passed it. He has gotten better, he doesn’t talk about being watched anymore, he rarely calls me Vin Desiel anymore, all the more extreme things, but he’s still very argumentative and overly inquisitive, still very random and off topic, still has his spaces-out, space staring some outs...anyway, a few days ago we both got really deep into conversation and he revealed to me that in 3rd grade his pedestrian diagnosed him with “The Truman Show Disease,” which when I researched it is basically a delusion in which the person affected believes their life or parts of it, is/are a staged TV Show or movie. They also believe that they are being watched, or that their environment has hidden cameras somewhere focused on them. I immediately knew that this was correct. Everything I had pushed to the side and came up with an explanation for was out the window the moment I read the definition. He tried to take back what he said out of embarrassment but I read up even more and everything all started making since. I read stories from other people who have the condition, and they almost exactly matched some of the things that confused me about John. One man explained how people he lived or cared about were celebrities to him, he gave them celebrity names, which related to how John  call’s me Vin Diesel. Everything started coming together, why he was always looking up and around when we were out in public, and the stories about his celebrity friends, Drake and Diddy, Jackie Chan, etc. The most chilling one was realizing why he always talked about “Making movies.” 
Now I’m a very logical person, I use logic to explain most things. This Truman Disease, doesn’t seem to be very official, it’s not recognized by important agencies, it’s was coined  
only in 2006, but it pretty much accurately describes John. I’m leaning towards thinking maybe the coined condition isn’t it’s own condition, but a product of a more serious condition. I really need some advice on what to do here. I need to know how to deal with this. It’s been hard enough already, but now knowing this new information about his diagnosis. How do I communicate with him better? I rarely understand what he’s saying. All the random outbursts, and off topic comments. All the figurative language disguising what he really means. Stubbornness to explain what he means when I don’t understand. The sarcasm, the constant interruptions, and talking over me, all the things he does I used to get mad at him about, I don’t want to. I need to know how to communicate with him better. How to understand him better. And god what if he ever break down with me, and starts talking about the cameras and things again. I don’t understand how this works because he obviously knows he has the condition and can talk about it, so how can people with this disease truly believe his life is a TV show? I don’t understand it. I really want to help him because for some reason this has never been disclosed to his family which basically kicked him out and shun him, which I’m also not very informed of but I’m sure if they had known this things would be different. Also how can I get him some help? No insurance! Hopefully someone here can guide me in helping my friend. Thanks everyone. ",10Mar2019,0
151,I spend way too much time on social media. Sometimes I think it might be a contributing factor in my depression because my life kind of sucks atm and people online my age(35) and younger are just killing it with there careers (I’m jobless). It kind of makes me feel bad about myself.,10Mar2019,2
152,"Hi all, 

&amp;#x200B;

To give you some background about myself; I am a 27 year old, college educated male (I graduated in 2015) who has worked in the political sphere for the past 4 years. I recently wrapped up working on a campaign in California and have come to the point in my life where I am reflective on the past 8 years of my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mental health issues began in 2012 when I was in a terrible relationship with someone in College. From there, I developed terrible anxiety issues and severe depression. Being the 21 old college person I was, I tried to self medicate with Alcohol and Drugs. I attempted to commit suicide in 2013-2014. I then spent 6 months out of College trying to get myself back together. Sufficient to say, I was not able to. I returned to University and returned to my old ways. 

&amp;#x200B;

I felt I was cured by 2015 of my mental health issues, yet I continued to drink and do drugs. I eventually entered the political world and had a new breath of life. I stopped drinking. I began focusing on work and improving myself.

&amp;#x200B;

But then I had another terrible experience with the opposite sex. I returned to drinking. In 2017, I could honestly say I was a functional alcoholic. I was actually fired from a job in 2018, and I partially blame it on the amount I was drinking. I was able to bounce back and get a job that I thought was out of my league. I was very successful in it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past two years, I have moved the needle on my career and I feel that I have come to a point where I can get to the next level. However, I see several issues. I still suffer from Anxiety, depression, and some anti-social tendencies. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I set up an appointment with a therapist that specializes in the issues that I am having. And I am sure with consistent help, medication, and self-reflection I can get better. 

&amp;#x200B;

The issue though is that my career requires me to travel frequently and work long hours. And I feel if I do travel and work consistently, I will not be able to dedicate myself towards good mental health. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think getting a stationary job where I am currently at will help. But I am also thinking taking time away from politics is a good idea. 

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone done anything similar before? Taking time away from your career in order to focus on improving your mental health?

153,"Keyboard broken so not really many punctuation keys besides , and .

&amp;#x200B;

I \[22f, UK\] only recently went to a counsellor for an assessment on my depression/anxiety that I've known about for years but never sought help for. Counsellor looked visibly shocked/sad when I explained how long for but that's a separate realisation and post in itself.

I am a helper/fixer/caring personality type person with a guilt-complex a thousand miles wide. This is important for the next bit.

&amp;#x200B;

My friend \[24f\] who moved a distance away a couple years ago, has a range of severe mental illnesses for which she has been hospitalised before, briefly because funding here is messed up, and is heavily suicidal. There's a whole bunch of environmental factors that basically boil down to her not having a good, stable support network besides me and one other friend. Anyone else is either a contributing factor or self-destructive themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently she's been relying on me more when she has meltdowns/suicidal tendencies. Phoning/texting me in the middle of a meltdown and the local mental health team can't get to her quick enough. Which is fine, I understand she needs someone and I'd rather she phone me than do something self-destructive. All our conversations lately swing round to her mental health because she is constantly self destructive and not in a position to get out of her situation.

&amp;#x200B;

But recently I've noticed she also doesn't really talk to many others except me. And it's beginning to take over my thought processes in that I'm constantly worried about her, worried that she's self harming after I hang up the phone - she's a compulsive liar too in her depressive states. And I'm finding that it's making my depression/anxiety worse. The past few years my own suicidal ideation has gone up, I have no desire to kill myself I just don't want to exist/be alive. Whenever I look up online what to do in a situation where really she should be phoning Samaritans it mostly comes up with 'just listen' or 'be there for your friends', which is not really helpful when I have to make a split second decision as to whether I have to call an ambulance to her near location based on some panicked and worrying rambling and reassurances that I can't fully trust. I talk to people in my immediate support network - I phoned my dad after the last one and he was basically like ''you're a good friend but take care of yourself. If anything happens it's not your fault.''

&amp;#x200B;

tldr; suicidal friend phones me when she won't phone samaritans, how do i be there without making my own or her suicidal ideation worse. Personal advice/anecdotes appreciated despite knowing it's a very individual case by case basis.",10Mar2019,1

When was the last time you did something nice for yourself?  If you have to think about it for more than 30 seconds, it wasn't recent enough!  Our western culture tends to focus on ""do do do"", yet often all the things we are doing are not directed at taking care of ourselves. And guess what happens if we don't take care of ourselves?  

Everyone suffers.

156,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

To be brief, I was diagnosed for the first time with depression at eight years old and severe anxiety disorder as a teenager. I've gone through much therapy, counselling and in recent years intensive therapy due to post traumatic stress. I recently read by chance on an Instagram post from a friend who has from OCD/Intrusive Thoughts and I had never felt so seen. I thought it was worth a shot to try [Dr.Google](https://Dr.Google) and read an article and again, felt like I was reading something from my psychologist's notes. Any insight on where to look for help, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you VERY much for your time and kindness &lt;3
