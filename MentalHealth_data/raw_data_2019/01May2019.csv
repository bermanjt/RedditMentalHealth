0,"Hi all, just wondering if anyone could help me come to a decision about what to try next, as I am really stuck. This is going to be kinda long because there are some complicated factors, but I hope someone will have some time to hear me out and perhaps throw a few ideas at me.  


First, some context for my situation: I grew up with family violence, an alcoholic parent and a violently aggressive sibling, which means that I had ongoing exposure to regular traumatic experiences as a kid. In addition to this, I seem to have a much more sensitive personality than the others in my family, my emotions and experiences were usually ignored/overlooked/dismissed because of other things going on. I was basically ""on my own"" all through childhood, I had no adults for support, no safe places to go (except for school when I was little; as I got older school also became an unsafe place because I was bullied).  No doubt all of this stuff set me up for depression which set in during my early teens. I was diagnosed at 19 with depression, went on my first medication at around 20 (fluoxetine). I'm now in my early 30s. The most prominent psychological symptoms tend to be that I hate myself, I feel I'm an inferior person to everyone else, I'm never good enough, have a REALLY harsh inner critic etc. In a nutshell, I guess I wasn't raised in an environment that let me learn I'm an OK person and that I am loved. Instead my mind became very self-hating. Physical symptoms tend to be that sleep a hell of a lot, and feel tired and fatigued all the time.  


Most recently in my life I have been diagnosed with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, by my local hospital's mental health department. Since my early 20s I have tried a bunch of the SSRIs (fluoxetine, citalopram, venlafaxine, sertraline, escitalopram, and some others I can't remember) and none of them have been all that satisfactory. Some of them I couldn't stay on for long because I couldn't cope with the side effects. I recall fluoxetine being great to begin with and then ""pooping out"" after a year or so. Because I was scared of going on really high doses of it, I opted to start trying different medications. A bunch of meds didn't agree with me, and in my mid-late twenties I was on sertraline. I found that out of all of them, sertraline really gave me the best mood boost most of the time, and I think a bit of an energy boost as well. 

About a year and a half ago I went to my doctor and told her I wanted to find a drug that would work but wouldn't cause the sexual side effects I have (which is, basically no sex drive and no ability to orgasm). I am married and have been on antidepressants pretty much my entire marriage, so we have not really ever had a time that we enjoyed a loving and active sex life together. My doctor switched me to escitalopram to give that a try. I think it made me tireder than sertraline ever did, and I don't believe it improved my sex drive at all. She looked into more options for me and decided to refer me to a psychiatrist at the hospital, plus a therapist because I was having really bad bouts of depression still. So currently I've been trying some different meds with the approval of my psychiatrist; last year I tried a combination of escitalopram and aripiprazole (Abilify) which was meant to help get my sex life back and give me some more energy. Aripiprazole was HORRIBLE to start up on (I had migraines and fainting), and then once I was on it for a while I found it didn't do anything for my energy, and only a very little for the sexual side of things (my orgasms came back but they were SO DULL). Most recently my psychiatrist let me try bupropion (Wellbutrin to some of you). I had really high hopes for it because I've read about it helping sexual side effects and energy levels. I came off escitalopram completely before starting bupropion. I was on bupropion for 4 weeks, and stopped about a week ago because I just can't tolerate how fast it makes my heart beat. My anxiety also went way up and I found myself constantly fretting about my daughter's wellbeing (I kept convincing myself she was going to stop breathing at night, or that any mild symptom of illness meant she was going to die). I got so jittery and worried about things that I just decided to stop. The ONE good thing about bupropion though is that it helped my energy levels amazingly, and my sex drive went back to normal. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this is where I'm stuck. I am currently not taking ANYTHING, and I don't know if I should continue taking nothing, go back to sertraline, or try something new. In the past I have attempted to come off medication, and failed miserably. I thought then that it was my depression relapsing, BUT I know now that it could have been withdrawal symptoms that made me feel so bad. I have read these symptoms can last for months for some people. Currently I have been off escitalopram for about 5 weeks, and off bupropion for 1 week. I could still be at risk for withdrawal effects impacting on my mood. I am feeling okay, but have found myself feeling more ""doom and gloom"" about life (anxiety about everything, I've been more teary and crying, I've been more irritable etc). I'm certainly not as ""happy"" or coping with things as well as I was on sertraline. I am worried about the potential consequences of having untreated depression. My daughter is three, and needs a loving and caring mother; I am worried about the impact of my mood on her psyche. Also about the impact on my relationship with my husband and friends/family. 

My hesitancy to try something new (which would be tricyclics) is that I am SO SICK of going through all the starting/stopping symptoms associated with trying new meds. Also the disappointment of yet another one not working out. I think I may have even mentally 'primed' myself to expect failure, and I'm not sure if that affects my overall results with any of the meds. Also I know that with tricyclics they have even MORE side effects than SSRIs do, and I don't think ANY of them come without the sexual side effects. I really just don't see the point in trying another med.

My hesitancy to go back on sertraline is that even though I know it probably gave me the best mood boost, I KNOW it will take me back to having a dead sex drive, and I hate that. What is the point in having a sexless relationship with my spouse. I know that sex isn't everything but it is an important part of a romantic relationship. I know that many sexless marriages end up being cold and distant or they just, well, end. This in itself contributes to depression.

  
I just want a treatment that will allow my body to continue working as it should, and I don't feel any of my medication options allow me that. I want to return to work soon, so I also don't want to be back on anything that's going to make me really tired.   


Is there hope for MDD \*without\* medication? I mean I have read a lot of stories of people who say they ""beat depression"" without medication, but were they suffering from chronic major depression and anxiety? I should mention I researched and tried a bunch of supplements in the past but none of them helped me as much as SSRIs did. Would intense therapy help me be happier? How do I train my brain to stop hating on me and instead be more loving? Would that give me more stable feelings? I'm not looking to feel happy all the time, but to have more of a sense that life isn't frightening and that I am actually capable of functioning as a normal human being on society. I have an opportunity to train for my dream job soon and I don't want to fuck it up because of my mental and emotional instability.

1,"Hey, this is one of my first posts but I didn’t really know where else to post...

I have found the musical ‘Next to Normal’ and fallen completely in love with it. It seems that producers, in their monetary wisdom, don’t feel like it should make it to UK shores, but I disagree.

I wondered if Reddit could reach to Brian Yorkey or Tom Kitt to release to smaller theatres or productions to raise awareness? Even schools for individual songs, please??

I can’t tell everyone the number of times I’ve replayed ‘You Don’t Know’ to myself and then gone to sleep listening to the rest of the original cast reminding me I’m not a freak... I’m just ill... I miss the mountains of the days I had some say... 

Please, anyone...",01May2019,1
2,"I quit my retail job because the depression part of my bipolar disorder has been very severe. I also was diagnosed with ADHD around 4 months ago. Because of both of these conditions, I found my ability to perform well at work has suffered. I am visibly in a bad mood, constantly stressed, cannot focus, and constantly forget things. My self esteem has been at an all time low. I feel as if I cannot succeed in any job given to me. 

However, in a couple of months I will be legible to be prescribed a new type of medication for ADHD (a stimulant) as long as I stay clear from drug abuse. In the past, I have abused stimulants for recreational use and studying purposes. I told my psychiatrist this and she told me that I can only be prescribed stimulant medication after 6 months of being drug-abuse free. I have been using non-stimulant medication to treat ADHD, but it has not worked as well as I would hope.

I am also hoping that the stimulant medication will help with the negative mood symptoms of bipolar disorder. I take lithium to stabilize my mood and it has helped but I still feel depressed.

In the mean time, should I take a 2 month long break from work until my medication is available to me? Or am I being too hard on myself and should continue to work?",01May2019,1
3,Thankfully I’m on disability and housing now but dealing with all my health issues and autism sometimes feels like a perpetual hell.,01May2019,1
4,"**Background:** I am near the end of my second year of college, and while I was incredibly depressed / mood-swingy / anxious last year, I've had it under much better control this year (especially after figuring out an antidepressant that seems to work well ... not all the time, but certainly better than being on nothing). In the past, people have viewed me as introverted, but I have realized this year that what I (and other people apparently) thought to be introversion was just a combination of social anxiety and depression. The better my mental health got, the more I realized that I believe myself to be an extroverted person in the sense that I love interacting and connecting with people.  I truly felt like myself at college first time this year. That being said, I believe I have an insecure, anxious attachment style (something that I learned about in one of my classes, actually; this means that I have a strong desire to be close to others, but fear that others won't respond to this desire). The more the school year went on, the more I tried to start conversations with people and I was really happy for a little while around a few months into the school year. 

**Currently:** However, for a few months now, I have felt that the connections that I was forming throughout the first half or so of the school year were beginning to fade away. I would still try to talk with and hang out with people, but they began to seem more and more uninterested in interacting with me. I live in a suite of six people including myself, and I used to hang out in our common room (nice shared living room with a couch and chairs, table, a TV, gaming consoles, etc.) with them all the time, and it was a really great time. However, practically every time I am in the common room now and someone enters the suite, they either go straight to their room or leave the suite soon after to go hang out with other people (many of whom are people I know too). I frequently ask my suitemates if they want to go to dinner or lunch with me, and they often ask each other too, but they almost never ask me, even when I am in the suite or in the same room as they are. They threw a birthday party and/or dinner for everyone in the suite except for me, and often push me into buying alcohol for the parties that I am only partially ever paid back for. 

When other people who I thought were my friends enter the suite, they sometimes just poke their head in and see I'm the only one there, and then they just leave without saying a word or giving me a chance to say hello. The most interaction I get with these people now is them coming in, asking if another one of my roommates is there; if I say yes, they go to his room and close the door, and if I say no, they just leave. 

At dinner, I find that even when I try to get in on conversations or start new ones, I am sometimes straight up ignored and will have to repeat myself, other times people will just briefly acknowledge that I said something and then continue talking to one another. And I know this sounds like I am just not being active enough in the conversation, but I have noticed that people will hardly even look me in the eyes anymore even when I'm trying to be part of their conversation. Like, when I talk to them they will never address me directly, and will even often respond to things I said by saying something to a different person. 

I always try to join in when I have the chance to hang out or do something with people, but while my suitemates are constantly invited to do things with other people, I don't think anyone (aside from my friend from high school who is also here) has asked / invited me to do anything with them in so long.

To make things worse, most of my suitemates decided to make housing plans for next year together without even asking me. The details are hard to explain, but essentially their decision to do so forced me into my absolute last option: living in a double for a third year in a row with a random transfer student roommate, in a suite of people I sort of know but have never gotten along with, located in the farthest position possible from the other people in my year. 

**TL;DR:** Second year of college ending, my mental health is better this year and I was much more social/happy for first half of year, but now all my ""friends"" seem to be avoiding me // completely disinterested in me. I am feeling extremely lonely and spend hardly any time with friends anymore, not by choice.

**Questions:** Why do the people I once got along with great seem to avoid me at all costs now? Should I keep trying to be friends with them, or say fuck them and let them drift out of my life and try to find new friends? Why do most other people here seem to be much better-liked than I am and have many more friends than I do? Am I doing something wrong / viewing the situation inaccurately? I am ready and willing to do things differently, but I honestly feel powerless over my own happiness right now.

*\*note: I have confronted them about the housing thing, and they said they still want to be my friend, but didn't give any sort of good explanation for why they didn't include me in the first place*",01May2019,1
5,"Not sure where to post this, but this sub seemed appropriate. My sibling has had issues with depression, ADD and some other things. I think they have some bipolar and/or schizophrenic tendencies, and after they drank a bottle of wine and smoked a joint last night, (which I wasn’t aware of until the morning - I’ve been sober for a few years now), they had a bit of a breakdown. They would start sobbing then stop on a dime, say “I’ll be the last in the family to die” and was contradicting themselves every other sentence. They confide in me sometimes, so I calmly asked if they often feel this way, (“yes but I haven’t felt suicidal in a few months”), if they see things that aren’t there (yes), and I know they’ll often go days without sleep. I’m concerned because I couldn’t tell what was genuine and what was an act, what they said about outliving the family really freaked me out. I’m worried they’re going to hurt themselves or someone else, but the other members of the family think I’m overreacting. I’m kind of at a loss of what to do - and having been through the ringer of mental health treatment myself - I don’t know what to do. Any advice, experience or commentary would be much appreciated - as well as advice on where else on reddit I could seek information.",01May2019,1

7,Sometime in beginning to middle of 2017 I had an experience where I was hearing voices like people talking. I believed there were people outside my house talking about me. This went on for about 2 or 3 months before I was taken to a hospital. In the hospital I was still hearing voices of people talking and it was the same voices. I thought there was a microphone or camera in the hospital room where people were watching me. The doctor prescribed me seroquel and I was discharged. I was happy to be home and never wanted to go back to the hospital. A few weeks went by and I heard voices  again. Hearing the same things of people talking about me like they were outside my house. Again I was taken to a hospital. This time a different hospital. In the hospital I still heard voices of people talking about me. Then I figured out it was the air conditioner in the room that somehow made me think it was people talking. This is strange because I also have an air conditioner in my room at home and that could also have made me think I was hearing people talking. The doctor at the hospital gave me invega and Effexor and I was discharged. I was happy to be home again. This time I didn’t hear any more voices. I went to outpatient therapy which I am still going to and I see a psychiatrist who prescribed me invega. I no longer hear voices and I haven’t heard voices since late 2017 or early 2018. Even though my psychiatrist has been prescribing me invega for about a year now I do not take the medication as prescribed. I take it at night and it makes me drowsy the next day and I have to work all day it’s very difficult to go through one day at work feeling drowsy I dread going through it everyday so I do not take the medication. So I don’t take the medication and I don’t hear the voices. I’m wondering if this was something that was caused by social isolation and being out of work because I was isolated for a long time before I heard voices and went to hospitals. Could this be a misdiagnosis of schizophrenia and it could have been caused by social isolation? Keep in mind I was 34 years old at the time and I never had this experience before in my life I’m 35 now and haven’t heard voices since then. I hate taking this medication cause of the drowsy feeling and I feel like I really don’t even need it. The doctor says that it’s an illness and there is no cure. I’m thinking it’s a misdiagnosis. Another thing that bothers me is that this has probably affected my medical records which will effect my career because I’m planning on getting a CDL next year. If this is a misdiagnosis can I dispute the medical records and have them changed so they don’t say I have schizophrenia or whatever they wrote down? I really appreciate anyone who can give me some answers because this is effecting my plans for the future and my ability to make money.,01May2019,2

11,"I have a friend who believes he speaks daily to angels and demons, he quit his job and moved state to become a counsellor / healer (which he does for free). He thinks he has a gift, passed through his family from ancient times, of healing and understanding human nature and the worlds beyond this one. He sees signs everywhere, especially in numbers (number plates, time of day etc). 

He has deeply integrated his many (what I would call) delusions into a hodge-podge of spiritualism, tarot and mysticism. So that any talk of mental illness is rejected out of hand. He genuinely feels he has access to something that most other people don’t. 

He speaks with clarity and intelligence, his thoughts aren’t muddled, and he has a decent amount of self awareness. He doesn’t seem paranoid. But as he talks, his ideas sound more and more grandiose, revealing an almost Christ-like sense that he exists to help others, at the expense of his own happiness and well-being, perhaps even through his suffering (though he would probably deny that). His vegan diet is becoming more and more restricted. And he has cut out most of the people from his old life.

12,"I went to therapy for about 2.5 years.

My second therapist didn’t really show any kind of sympathy or compassion, or even suggestions really. Like I was talking to someone who just didn’t want to hear any of it. Third therapist was a similar situation as the second, and she canceled 4 consecutive sessions of mine, which is when I decided to just forget it. I know that therapists can’t really have blue personalities otherwise they get too wrapped up in their patients’ lives, but at the same time, I want to be able to go to therapy and leave feeling like I’m not just another person’s burden.

Problem is, I live in an area where mental healthcare workers are infamous for mistreating patients and being able to get away with it due to the lax mental healthcare laws we have. I'm not interested in trying antidepressants, and I doubt I ever will be, but it's completely legal for a psychiatrist to ram them down my throat if they simply felt like it, regardless of whether or not I'm actually a threat to myself. And they can legally force me into continuing to take it for an indefinite amount of time, regardless of how it affects me. Needless to say, it's pretty unnerving. 

I've been trying to keep my medical record clean of any mention of mental health issues in order to prevent judgement from doctors and such, and haven't even bothered seeing anyone for it since I was a minor, but it always seems to follow me around. I feel like I'm at my wit's end, but I can't stand having to live in fear of how some bored authority figure could easily ruin my life if I accidentally frustrate them too much.

I've recently told him I'll no longer seek contact with him. I'm putting this here because I feel bad and I don't wanna fall back into depression now that I've finally started on my way out of it.

She eats like a pig, I have many pet peeves but chewing is the biggest. She chews with her mouth open (only recently) and when I ask her if it’s like her teeth that are hurting or something, she responds with a scolding. She can get so hurtful but I’m growing to not care anymore. She’s also beginning to talk extremely loudly, and she randomly like let’s out deep groans like she’s upset or something. I love my mother but recently it’s just... fading. I feel like she’s different, maybe it’s age but she’s just so annoying now. I know I may sound like a typical teen but I don’t like hating my immediate family. (My mother raised us to keep our mouth closed while we eat so all those years of her getting pissed at me got to me, so it’s not like this is a normal thing.)

My room is scattered with crumpled up papers with half finished drawings, my sketchbook is extremely thin, and I'm getting hopeless that I will ever draw something good again. I don't have any motivation to draw, and when I do I beat myself up for days because I can't make anything turn out right. Every single time I try to draw it always ends in me crying and wanting to just die because I am so awful. At this point, I just want to quit all together. 

The problem with quitting drawing is that pretty much my whole identity is that I am an artist. Without my drawings, nobody cares about me and I don't have anything to put passion in to. Without a talent, what's the point of doing anything anymore? I'm not good at anything else, and now my one redeeming skill is fading too.

he coops up in his room and comes out at night once he knows me and our parents are done showering and are in bed. he doesn’t really talk to us. maybe me, sometimes, but never about his depression or OCD. just about movies or youtube videos or cookies or cakes that are in the kitchen. he works as a nutritionist at a hospital but only works 4 days a month. him and our dad have him paying some fees for rent (i think its around $400?) because my dad wants him to know some sort of responsibility. 

(background — i have generalized anxiety disorder/social anxiety disorder that i have medication for and have gone to therapy for. i am doing well and have a wonderful relationship with my parents.)

anyways, my parents both have come to me this week — my mother in tears and my father in controlled/suppressed anger — in frustration about what to do with my brother since he’s gotten worse. he’s stick thin and walks around afraid to touch things, shaking and pale, and doesn’t look at anyone and mumbles replies when spoken to. 

they try to talk to him about therapy (which he says he goes to but we don’t know if he actually does, since again, he never talks to us) and try to encourage him to just do anything to help himself get better. 

it hurts to see my brother like this since we used to be really close growing up. but i will be honest, we’ve grown apart and now he feels like a roommate that’s just...there. i hate seeing my parents so distraught over their son and i hate having to be a mediator between everyone and their frustrations. 

my parents want to move back to the philippines for retirement (we live in canada) and i keep encouraging them to since i feel like they need a break from
how suffocating the house can be. i just want my parents to get the space to just enjoy their lives and be with family back home without having to worry about my brother but its their son and they don’t want to abandon him. i said that once i get a full time job (which i hope to within the next two years) they should just book it back home as fast as they can. 

personally, i think it might give my brother the space to just kinda have a wake up call or something. yanno, not having our parents there. but i dunno. i’m just tired and i wish i had my brother back and i want my parents to stop crying.

30,"Most of her paranoia and delusions are about there being implants in her, people or entities controlling her, sometimes she talks about me and my sister being manipulated as well. She has been a bit mentally off ever since she lost her high-end job around 8 years ago. She has been getting worse recently. She types up bizarre documents many days and gives them to me. These documents make little since and talk about things like the date the people who are manipulating her must pay her the money she is owed. She is extremely stubborn and extremely against the idea of mental health medication or being forced to do anything voluntarily. She is all about control, and feels extremely agitated that there are supposedly implants in her that control her.

I go for walks with her sometimes. I am trying to get her to at least participate in a community center. I think the social interaction will help. She is more willing to do things if I (or my sister, when she is here) does them with her, just for the sake of spending time with us. Right now, her, my dad (her husband), and I live in the same house, but I will be moving far away soon. I don't want her to have a breakdown.

34,"Posting this on my throwaway account.

I guess the short version is that I (20F) and kind of worried about my brother (24M).

I’ve kind of had suspicions that he has depression for a while now, but have felt powerless to address it. Especially since our relationship is usually about nagging each other or ranting endlessly about whatever shows/games/etc we’re currently into despite the fact the other person knows nothing about it.

We definitely don’t talk about feelings lol.

My own mental health’s been kind of bad for years as well, but I’m finally starting to feel a bit more positive and clear headed finally, and to top it off I finally brought myself to schedule a therapy appointment week after Monday to ensure I don’t start going downhill again.

Honestly, I feel like he should go to therapy, but it seems inappropriate to just up and suggest it.

Some other context: A couple years ago, he dropped out of college to start working at a theme park because he stopped attending classes (he’s always been super smart and hard working and all his high school classmates saw him as this super ambitious guy). He lived with my dad and stepmom for a while after, and they helped him get an actual office job, but when they tried to nudge him toward moving out and taking more control over his life, he got kind of aggressive (due to long standing issues from their divorce) and moved out.

He’s now living with my mom, who financially speaking can’t really afford to support him long term, especially since almost two years ago he lost his job (fired for falling asleep too much on the job as a result of him never getting near enough sleep). He hasn’t worked since. He did take an online class once at my mom’s insistence but it never went anywhere. Right now he has no real aspirations other than gaming and hypothetical world building with his online friends. He has no IRL friends, either—used to be in a D&amp;D group, but it fell apart.

My mom’s convinced he’s on the autism spectrum despite the fact that when he was tested in high school the doctor said he didn’t. Also, he doesn’t really have any signs of autism outside of having both intelligence and asocial tendencies. I’m pretty sure he’s just depressed (he’s also texted me a couple of jokey depression memes. Not to say neurotypical people never laugh at/relate to those memes, but still, doesn’t help).

My mom and brother currently live in a remote area where jobs are hard to get. My mom works, but it’s a remote job that pays minimum wage.

She also has this fantasy that she and him will move out to live with me in the next few years and we’ll all live together and he’ll go to college again this time to be some sort of medical tech and everything will be okay. I don’t think that’s realistic, since the area I live in is super expensive. The three of us would have to share a one bedroom apartment, considering that he wouldn’t have a job and she only makes minimum wage.

Regarding my situation: I’m currently in college, soon to graduate, and with a job lined up. Needless to say, I’ve been super fortunate. Unfortunately, this also means that any conversation I initiate might be perceived as demeaning, especially coming from a younger sibling.

Any thoughts? I don’t know how to approach the topic that I think the reason he’s been out of a job with no aspirations for years is depression and that he should seek help (Skype therapy? I’d even be willing to help pay if needed but I can’t see that offer going over well).

I think I might have some memory loss that could possibly be a system of another health related issue that’s more severe... I have a very difficult time remember things like when someone reminds me of something that happened, say a few years ago, I very briefly remember the memory but not as much as an average person should. Also, I study for days and hours with various different study methods but I have an extremely difficult time retaining the information. I fail most exams despite studying every day. Any “average” person that puts this amount of time into studying, usually does fairly well on exams. But, I can’t recall 80% of the material even if it’s something that’s uncomplicated. Also, this could be related, but I have difficulty putting my thoughts into words. I can never fully express what I want to say in words, even if I’ve gone over it in my head, and end up sounding stupid.

36,"Hey Reddit! I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for about three years. Mental health is very difficult, but I've developed pretty good therapy skills. I have very few friends and all of them call me their personal therapist. I like to help people out and make them feel better, at least a little bit. I'm known for giving good, thoughtful advice and speeches. Yes, giving advice can be harmful, but I always mention that before saying anything. So, yesterday, I decided that it would be a good idea to register on 7Cups and become a listener. 7Cups basically consists of online therapy and free counseling. One of the first things that I didn't like from the start is that I was not allowed to share my opinion. But whatever, I thought, at the end of the day, I'm still helping people. It was pretty easy from the start. I helped people, they were all really nice. But few hours later, I messages this girl with a pink profile picture. I sent my usual welcoming message, blah blah blah nice to see you here. And don't get me wrong, I actually tried to provide the best experience to each one of the members I got to talk to. But this girl started off with ""my friend killed herself an hour ago"", which was.. just shocking to me. Of course I tried to help as best as I could, using all of my knowledge. But once she told me ""direct me to someone else"", I lost it. I did what she asked me to do, wished her good luck, and had a full on panic attack. I could not think about anything else for a good minute. I'm still in shock and I feel awful because I could not help. Maybe this job is just not for me. I hope someone else helps her.",01May2019,2

This is for those of you who are struggling with meds or don't believe you need meds or even to get help.

First of all, PLEASE don't be afraid to get help. Please don't get discouraged. Some meds suck at first, some DOCTORS suck at first. I've been through a few doctors until I found one that I clicked with. It can be embarrassing and awful to try to explain how you're feeling, I know - but please try. You need to take the first step.

I have have had extremely bad anxiety most of my life. So bad that I had to go to court because I couldn't go to school BECAUSE of my anxiety. Such bad anxiety that when I finally achieved my dream of studying abroad, only a month in, I had to leave. I had a panic attack and blacked out. 
I have extremely bad ADHD. I had people coming into my classrooms as a child and secretly studying me because of how bad it was.
In the last few years my depression became so bad that if I hadn't gotten help I would've killed myself. My arms are covered in scars. I lost my job I loved. I didn't leave my bed for months. I couldn't DO anything. The depression is what made me get help.

I grew up in a scientologist household that is so against medication and doctors that it isn't even funny. I grew up thinking medication and doctors are bad. While natural remedies are great, when you are about to kill yourself every single day, you NEED to get medication or some kind of help from a doctor. When you can't get yourself out of bed to do anything, you need to get help. It's no way to live. My family kept telling me ""just wake up and smile, depression isn't real"" while I'm hiding the fresh self harm cuts under my sleeves. Every night I was planning my suicide. My emotions were so uncontrollable.
I finally decided I couldn't take it anymore. I was going to get help or I was going to die. 
So I found a psychiatrist.
It took me a long time to find a psychiatrist. They are hard to come by unfortunately, but keep trying. I am beyond grateful for the one I have. Please try to find somebody who specializes in mental health. Going to your regular doctor generally isn't the greatest idea.
It took me a while to find a medication that works, and it is frustrating, but once you find one that works - it's just amazing. I'm becoming me again. It can be extremely irritating to wait to feel normal again, but it will happen. Give it time. It's normal to also feel worse before you feel better. I had a few days where I was the lowest I had ever been in my life while the medication was altering my brain. I had extremely AWFUL side effects. But I would take a month of side effects over not feeling happy again. The side effects eventually went away. The extreme sadness and want to harm/kill myself went away. My anxiety got better. Hell, even today I did something that I would've NEVER done with my anxiety (take an uber). I'm not nearly as socially anxious as I used to be. I enjoy talking to people.
I started medication for ADHD as well, which has been a godsend and also helps with making me more social. My life has turned around.
Please, please, please - while not every medication works for every person, GIVE IT TIME. Wait a couple months. I've seen so many people say they took a medication for a day or two but gave up because of the side effects. The medication I'm on made me throw up constantly (huge fear of mine) for a whole month. But I stuck through it. I haven't got sick in a year now. I'm actually doing my hobbies again after not getting out of bed for months. I'm just so happy. It might take a couple months to even notice a difference. 

If you don't have insurance, or if you can't afford it - there are options. Please Google based on where you live affordable insurance options. Do your research. I can help you if you'd like.

Don't give up easily. Find a good psychiatrist. Try therapy. Be honest about how you're feeling. Ask for help from someone you trust. Just please, don't give up. You'll get better. 

If anyone wants to talk, I am here for you!! I'll help you with anything you need :)
Stay strong you guys!!",01May2019,15

i settled for a MH clinic with a spanish name... which is ok because I am half puerto rican. So I ended up getting a psychiatrist that doesnt speak english but is learning. We started talking about my MH issues (Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Schizoid Personality Disorder, PTSD, and Depression). The entire time she kept pointing out words on a piece of paper and asking me what they ment. The whole time I was talking, she kept nodding her head but I was unclear if she understood what I was saying. She asked me like 20 times if I was single, 10 times if I had a girlfriend, and 5 times if I was married.

So as the session was over (closing time), she asks me to sign a paper, as I got off the chair to sign it... I farted without knowing it was coming! she then started rushing me out the door LOLOLOL

I feel so guilty about everything, all the time. I can rationalize my decisions and say I have good intentions, but “bad” people do the same thing. How can you tell if you’re a bad person who is taking advantage of others’ kindness or an okay person who has normal supportive relationships?

Even my anxiety about this is gross and toxic. I have to constantly stop myself from asking for reassurance about everything so I don’t become a huge burden on the people I love. If I were a good person, wouldn’t I just be doing good stuff without frantically trying to tally up my morality points to make sure I’m not manipulating everyone around me? What if my negative feelings and emotions aren’t even real and they’re just excuses to control other people and get attention?

Posting this question in the mental health subreddit even feels like a shitty thing to do. Obviously I’m going to get a bunch of people being supportive! Is it just a way to avoid facing the consequences of being mean and lazy and inconsiderate? Is choosing those words manipulative because maybe they’ll make you latch onto them as way too hard on myself when they’re actually just all true? 

I got in a fight with my SO tonight because I interrupted him twice in a fun, spirited discussion. He snapped at me in frustration. I felt so bad about it that he ended up feeling terrible for snapping even though it wasn’t a big deal. But I couldn’t stop thinking that if I hadn’t interrupted, he wouldn’t have been frustrated. So it was my fault. But saying that made him sad. And I knew it would. So isn’t even feeling upset and not just accepting an apology bad? 

I just feel really lost. I know I shouldn’t say things are BAD, too. This is too long. I’m gonna end the post now. I’m sorry it’s all over the place. Most of that was just stupid ranting.

52,"I’m currently on my third sick day this week. I told my manager it’s a gastro problem (which is kind true as I have IBS and stress isn’t helping), 

My work know I suffer with mental health issues and last year we’re very accommodating with letting me take time off in the day to attend therapy sessions. However this year I’ve moved house, had to stop seeing my therapist (she’s on maternity leave) and have had huge pressures at work - finding myself take numerous days off/WFH. I worry I’m not making an appearance too much and fear my colleagues who don’t know I have mental health problems think I could just be skipping work.

Taking time off I’m probably not helping myself. I have an eating disorder which leads to low moods, anxiety, depression, fear of leaving the house to see people and I usually spend a great deal of time in bed unable to do anything. 

Lately I worry the worse outcome of me doing this is I’ll be fired. I worry people won’t like me or understand the struggle and weight of mental health problems. Whist I’ve admitted to taking a day off for stress in the past lately I’ve decided to hide the cause for my sick days as I’m ashamed and anxious of the outcome.

Any advice?",01May2019,1
53,"I’m 16 and I think it’s time I start adulting and stuff I already have a job and my sister has said I can live with her indefinitely but I can tell that it would be more comfortable for her and her girlfriend if I moved out. They’re gonna get married soon and I wanna get out before all that sex fiend honeymoon shit. I’m diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar 1, but I’ve been taking lithium and it’s really been helping me stay normal I guess lol. I’m 3 months clean from heroin now and I think moving somewhere new might also help that temptation go away somewhat. I feel like I’m ready and my income is about 3.5k a month after taxes so I can afford rent and be comfortable in a apartment or a house with roommates. I’m excited and also really nervous but I think it will be good. Maybe the lithium’s not helping as much as I thought because in the time it took to get from the start of this post to here I have gone from optimistic to incredibly depressed",01May2019,2
54,"To start this off (because a lot of people do this) I’m not writing this for pity or for upvotes or whatever, I just want to share my story and make it something that helps others. heads up this might start slow, bear it out.. When I was 15 I was a pretty average kid. I was a pretty happy kid, i played football and volleyball, had a good group of friends, got along with my family and got good grades. Around the end of my freshman year/ start of my sophomore year I got 3 pretty serious concussions in a 9 month period, adding on to a very bad one I got in middle school. This was also the time I smoked bud and drank for the first time. Suddenly sophomore year school got very bad. Unknown at the time I got ADD and Major Neurocognitive disorder (affects processing speed). I was used to effortlessly getting As or Bs and suddenly I was getting C’s. It was a passing grade, but I go to a high preforming school and it felt like the end of the world. I used to be super hard on myself and bc of the low grades I developed a bad self critic (I call him simon cowell). Simon was me telling myself i’m not good enough, i’m bad at everything, no one likes etc. Depression and Anxiety started creeping in and at this time I was smoking week maybe once a month and drinking most fridays with friends. It gets worse and worse throughout the year and I have my first visit to the hospital, after trying tripping on benadryl  (yes that’s a thing) and freaking myself out. I was at this place that was nice but 100% useless for about a week then I went home. Things got worse and worse. I started drinking some week days and every weekend, smoking most days and starting to experiment with other drugs. Anxiety was big at this point and so I tried to drown it out with substances and depression was minimal. At this point my parents knew I was doing stuff and they were mad about it but they were afraid to approach me about it. Halloween in 2017 was a big point in my downward spiral. I was with a few friends drinking and having a pretty good time until maybe 10 at night. They leave and Im left with my anxiety and apathy and decide to text a dealer about what he has. He had just gotten a shipment of xanax and I had heard a lot about them so I got 10 of the green ones or “hulks” and like two of a smaller dosage. That night I took the small ones while drunk (never a good idea) and blacked out for the night and until maybe 8am while I was at school. According to my sister I was acting normal but I had no recollection of any of that night. So I kinda come back into consciousness at school and am in a bad place. I hate my life, myself, just everything. Depression was bad, and at this point the anxiety and panic attacks I had morphed into a apathy where I had stressed so much suddenly i didn’t care about consequences or people or myself. I don’t want it to seem like i’m glorifying drugs because yes it’s funny looking back but I was seriously ducking up my life. The memory is a little fuzzy and 90% of this is from other people’s filling in the blanks but I remember taking a few school, getting confused and missing my classes, eating lunch 3 times at different lunch periods, ending up at my friends house eating ramen two hours after school, then walking around my neighborhood and not much else. The filled in version is I tried like two of the hulks and kept saying didn’t feel it during study hall then decided to take the rest in class (thank god the teacher never noticed, then being absolutely stupid the whole day at school. My friend drove me home and watched me, then my mom came to pick me up. I got really mad, left the car at a stop light, walked inside a gas station near my house for nearly 30 minutes and the guy convinced me to call my parents to have them pick me up. My parents decided to take me to my grandparents house a couple hours away to get me in a safe place for a while. I was conscious for the first 30 minutes but then I went into a comatose state where they couldn’t wake me up. This is one of the hardest things to think about and one of the biggest regrets of my life because my 3 younger siblings were in the car with me and they had to watch their brother bar out then go to sleep and not wake up. My parents took me a hospital on the way where I was given an IV and they screened me for liver damage. You can’t overdose and die on xanax (or atleast it would be very hard) but you can mess your liver up or cause other health problems. I had minor liver stuff so they kept me there overnight and then took me to my grandparents house. My memories had a full  24 hour gap between getting picked up and waking up in my grandparents house. I had no idea what happened, the xanax caused to forget what I had taken or done. My dad came in and started yelling at me (well deserved yelling) about how I had exposed my siblings to it and how I have such a problem and all that. I was not in a clear mind and hearing this shredded me. As soon as he left I tried to hang myself with an extension cord. This was my very first time feeling suicidal and I didn’t know what to do and kind of tried then gave up and hid everything. Long story yes, but it shows how bad I had gotten. From there I was drinking pretty much every day, doing any drugs I could get my hands  on, verbally abusing my family by yelling and insulting, and skipping school. Of the second semester of my sophomore year I had 102/140 something days missed. I was very behind in school, I hated myself, hard everything around me, and was always drunk or high. Very low point. From November 2017-March 2018 I was in a psych ward 4 times, and a hospital twice for drug stuff. Late february I hit my breaking point. I stole two bottles of wine, drank a bottle in a half feeling sorry for myself, crying, and writing suicide letters. I wrote 26 letters that night all a page long. One for every birthday for all my siblings until they’re 18 and a few for my parents. I drank and thought and gave up. I’m gonna keep this PG but I grabbed a knife and really carved up my arms and legs. I had to get 93 stitches for 24 gashes on my forearms and right thigh and calf. I likely would have died that night but my dad woke up and checked on me. This is really hard to think about and re live because my dad had to walk in and find me in the bathtub, incoherent, in a bathtub full of bloody water. There was blood on the walls, carpet. I had gone to kiss all my siblings goodnight forever and left blood trails in their room before passing out in my bathtub. If I was any less drunk I likely wouldn’t be here right now because I passed out and couldn’t continue. This caused my last psych ward visit. February 2018 my parents sent me to a wilderness therapy program for several months and then a residential treatment center until january of 2019. I learned to love myself and to get rid of simon cowell. I started to find joy in the smallest things and those things got bigger. I met my two best friend to this day (even though they live in cali) and we rebuilt our lives together. The funny thing? I remember thinking that none of those things would happen, that life is hopeless and i’m a sack of shit. I wanted to share my story because tonight I dug out some of those letters I wrote and started bawling my eyes out.  Because I was at that spot where I was willing to destroy my family to end the pain and for all the kids out there that are in the same spot that I was and feel hopeless and alone, and are close to their breaking point. Everyone has heard “it’s going to be alright and it’ll get better” and I always just blew those off like fuck off you don’t know what i’m going through. Well i’m not going to say it’s going to be alright because yeah shits going to suck but there’s life worth living out there you just gotta hold on a little longer. 

Thanks for reading guys, you can dm me questions or if you are skeptical and want proof, but please don’t leave negative comments.",01May2019,1

56,"A lot of really shitty things have happened in the last few years and I'm starting to lose grip on myself. 
Aside from the usually childhood trauma (sexual assault &amp; bullying) I have to deal with still new things have started happening that make me feel like the universe is trying to break me.
A year ago both of my grandparents died after not having seen them for 2 years due to waiting for my green card and I could only attend one of their funerals, where I had to witness the horrible part of my family tearing the house apart for valuable stuff, in the middle of grieving. My grandpa died of old age, my grandmother was run over mmby a car backing out, her body being dragged a few meters until the driver noticed that he had hit a person. This had haunted me in my nightmares for months. 3 Months after my grandmothers death I had an accident in which a fire work hit my eye, leaving my face scarred and ugly. I had to move my wedding ceremony because the accident happened months before it was planned.  And working with the eye patch on in a service position in a semi-fast food place has traumatized me to an extent I never thought possible. You'd be suprised how many people will make pirate jokes or ""did your BF beat you jokes"" or come up in the supermarket to harass you about it, when they see a person who is clearly hurt.
I'm starting to come to work late, I'm having trouble sleeping, waking up AND getting to work (my anxiety makes me too scared to actually miss work or call in). I've reached this point where I just want to stop existing, and if it wasn't for my husband and my beautiful pets I might have hurt myself already. I just feel so lost and hurt and I don't know how to cope with it anymore. I've been crying myself to sleep nearly every night, trying not to wake my husband, trying ti not have this conversation with him. I feel like I've reached my breaking point.

I've contacted my doctor to talk about getting therapy but I am really scared. Our insurance covers it, but I'm scared that I won't actually be able to admit to my problems because I tend to just bottle things up. I don't know how I can make it through the 2 weeks that I have left until the appointment. I Don't know if I can do it.

60,"We are in college. My ex-girlfriend has severe depression and suicidal tendencies. While we were together, I was her support. She didn't really have anybody else, so I spent countless nights and countless hours supporting her, comforting her, and doing everything I could to help her get through bad nights. I've taken her to the ER multiple times, had counselors and the police check on her a few times when things got out of my control, visited her when she was in the ER, etc. I was pretty much the only person in her life to do this stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

She cheated on me with one of my friends. I told her that I would stay with her if she never saw the guy again, but she would not agree to this and said this was controlling and abusive. We decided to be friends, but even after we were now friends she kept telling me how much she loves me and wants me back. While at the same time sleeping with the guy she cheated on me with. 

&amp;#x200B;

I eventually broke things off with her and told her off. I was at this point no longer in contact with her. She then told all of our friends that I was emotionally abusive, and that I never did anything good for her and all I did was hurt her.  She convinced all of my friends that I was emotionally abusing her and none of them will talk to me.

&amp;#x200B;

She is telling them that I never did anything good for her and I never helped her in any way at all. They all hate me.

&amp;#x200B;

She has very, very mild autism, mostly just social cue related stuff. You would never, ever know by being with her. I still can't see it, and my own sister has autism. Toward the end of our relationship when she was in the ER for suicidal urges, she was told that she was suspected to have borderline personality disorder. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, why in the world would somebody do this? I never mistreated her once. I treated her like a queen, I did everything for her, I got her into snowboarding, I helped her through so much, I spent countless hours and nights with her until 3,4,5 in the morning when she was having bad thoughts, and then she cheats on me and tells everybody horrible lies about me emotionally abusing her. She has a new boyfriend now.

63,"Hey everyone.  Just going to rant and rave for a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm a 34 M diagnosed with bipolar and anxiety.  I have an extreme aversion to taking medication for it.  I've opted for other means to manage my mental sickness.  I practice Zen, I exercise, I take supplements (fish oil, a multivitamin, Saint John's Wort) and I try to avoid and control my triggers.  My therapist has been a massive help, but really wants to put me back on medication.  She says she's proud I made it this far, but with everything happening she thinks just a low dose of xanax would really help me.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate taking medication.  I've been off and on medication for my mental health since I was 12.  I got on it initially because the child shrink thought it would help me control my anger issues and emotional outbursts....which stemmed from vicious abuse by my peers.  That there is another story.    I have a massive issue with staying on medication because my family, some close friends, even my significant other, uses my medicine against me.  They take the fact that I'm medicated and it becomes a weapon any time I'm emotional for any reason.  A couple of examples:  I was having a really bad night at work.  Murphy's Law in full force.  I get home and have a bit of a tangent.  Nothing terrible.  Just ranting about how much my work atmosphere sucks.  The only thing my (now ex) girlfriend could say was ""Did you take your pills? You better take your pills.""  And that was every time I had a problem.  Upset cause I got pulled over and a ticket?  Take your pills.  My friend died and I was depressed?  Take your pills.  Someone at the bar took a swing at me and I'm not happy because of it? Take your pills. My dog is sick and its stressing me out? Take your pills.  I don't know how I'll make rent and it's giving me anxiety? Take your goddamned pills.  No matter what the case, no matter what had me emotionally compromise, I'm always just told to take my fucking pills and make it go away that way.

65,"For the basics, I’m 29. I have bipolar disorder type 1 and generalized anxiety disorder, and they’re severe enough that three separate medical professionals have given written statements documenting my inability to work, due to my conditions. I live with my wife, who is currently unemployed, (and just got out of psychiatric inpatient care) and my mother (who is on disability.)

They’ve recently taken it upon themselves to decide when I sleep, when I wake up, when I eat, when I shower, when I walk my mother’s dog (because she’s currently awaiting ankle surgery and can’t walk), when I go to the store, what I watch on tv, and they’ve even started telling me (together) that I should cut my hair like Jon Snow. (I don’t want to cut my hair like Jon Snow.)

I have no autonomy and no authority over my own life. I’m forcibly woken up, then I stumble into the bathroom to pee and while I’m in there I get orders barked at me through the door. At the first sign of a moment of peace, I try to sit in the living room or lay on my bed and I can literally count down the seconds until they tell me to go do something. And since we recently moved in, most of what I’m asked to do involves moving and building heavy IKEA furniture by myself, as well as taking huge loads of cardboard and trash in the elevator to the dumpsters in the garage, and bringing all of the new packages and deliveries upstairs - the cycle begins anew. Or my wife will make me do small things like she’ll hand me something and say, “Hold this” when she could just as easily have put it on the counter she was standing next to. It all adds up and overwhelms me.

To tell the truth, when my wife went to the hospital, before she was checked into inpatient psychiatric care, she only went because I needed to go and get checked in and she didn’t want me to go alone. I was at my wit’s end and my meds weren’t working anymore. But they didn’t admit me. They admitted her instead. I was overwhelmed a month ago. Now I’m over-overwhelmed.

If I’m not stable enough to work 40 or even 20 hours a week, how the hell am I supposed to be “on” 24/7 at home? I feel like a lackey. Completely unvalued. Unappreciated. And they make me feel guilty for asking for time to myself.

66,"I’m pretty much going crazy. All weekend I’ve been doing stupid shit. Saturday I got caught shoplifting from Ralph’s of all things and got off ridiculously easy. Went out at midnight for a walk even though I know there’s coyotes everywhere at night. Sunday I shoplifted like 5 shorts from the mall that I don’t even particularly like and some other shit, including a $65 dollar makeup palette even though I’m a guy that I just gave to a friend and a $90 bts  album thing just because of the high price tag and how easy it was to slip into a bag. I’ve stolen shit before because I was blacked out on benzos but I was completely sober these times. 

I’ve also been eating a fucking lot. I spent ~$50 on fast food last week alone compulsively. I have an eating disorder and I’m in sort of a binge/fast cycle. Today I realized I had literally $3 in the bank and no cash to buy food with. My kitchen is completely empty except for the shit my vegan boyfriend eats, fake bacon and peas and shit. I lost it. My boyfriend came home to me aggressively eating the last bit of pancake mix I’d bought a month ago with the questionably aged Nutella we’d been avoiding. I asked him if he had money to order food but we’re both broke as fuck from bills and shit. So I lost it some more. Started kicking shit and screaming when he tried to clam me down. I took my prescription xanax which is measly as shit (.25mg) and fucked up my thighs a lot. My bf cleared out of the house, I’ve had a few breakdowns like this before and he knows I’d rather be alone. 

I’ve eaten 3000+ calories today. It’s 3am right now and I feel like punching a wall because I’m hungry and it’s making me pissed as fuck. I would go straight to my therapist but I fucking can’t, I’m trans and considered ‘high risk’ for some suicide attempts like 6 months ago. I’m close to getting on hormone therapy but if they know I’m unstable right now they’ll pull the plug and right now that the only thing I’m living for.

To be completely transparent, I’m someone who suffers from a lot of anxiety issues, and I feel like I’m really struggling with issues of depression lately as well. I’ve been dealing with these issues for a very long time, and I truthfully have made a bad habit of repressing these issues.

I would really like to see a regular counselor and potentially be put on some sort of medication if possible.

Are there any good resources for finding a mental health professional in my area? Perhaps any websites or services I should refer to? I’ve obviously tried google, but I know that google only shows the surface level of what is probably available. I live in the Metro Detroit area within the US, if that helps/makes any difference.

It’s like saying the name doesn’t matter therefore you don’t need specific medications and therapy to fix it. Depression has a name because I’m not producing enough serotonin, it’s not just grouped in with every other mental illness and called “mental illness” it is it’s own thing. 

I only bring this up because my grandfather got upset I kept calling my issues by their names and I spoke to a nurse who said I didn’t need to put a name to the stuff I deal with, just treat it. 

I don’t know why we continue to treat mental illness like it’s taboo. It’s as serious as any other illness out there and I’m very disappointed in my grandfather, as I thought he had come to understand what I and others go through but he seems still stuck in his ways. I reached out to him when I was feeling open to talking probably for the first time ever and now I feel I can’t trust him again.

Before that I used to take Zoloft, and for some reason even after two months it didnt work.
I also used to take Lexapro years ago, it kicked in after two months, but stopped to work after 3-4 months.

I am so afraid this antidepressant wont work on me, as it did last one. What are the chances on that? Did I built tolerance on antidepressants, is this possible? I am afraid if it wont work after two months, the doctor will prescribe me something else, and I dont want to go through that hell once again.

80,"I have had very homicidal thoughts and a very big passion to learn about killers and learn how they do it, this has been going on the years, I know I am going to do it to the person I have been thinking about but the thought of not getting away is being destroyed about the thought I will make him feel what I felt.

81,"Hello i am 20 years old and i don't know how to stop certain toxic behaviors i have. I believe they have damaged many of my friendships and i need to stop them. Im not sure if my motivation to better myself is for my own well being or so i dont lose my friends, probably somewhere in the middle tbh.

My worst behaviors are lying about small things and making up stories, playing the victim, i always find a way to pass my blame off. A bad one i used to have was telling friends when i felt suicidal, everyone feels this way sometimes but i would say it to get attention(ive gotten much better about this, things slip out but i dont go out of my way to say them). I'll get better about suppressing these things for a while but i eventually devolve back to them. I dont say much to my family they constantly try and seem to be patient but i often meet them with anger or hostility or just a general bad attitude. A lot of my friends have stopped trying, I'll ghost friends for months then i wont leave them alone for a few weeks of conversations which eventually lead to me talking about how shitty i am then starting the cycle again. Also finding things to lie about or play the victim in(I'll go more into these things if asked about specifics). 

Most recently a close friend of mine lost some special and i was hitting her up trying to talk about my problems with lying. I had already told her i was sorry about her loss and gave her some advice( Ive been through something similar a few months ago and i didn't handle it healthily at all, i recommended her to talk about it). This was very fucked up like shes in the middle of mourning a friend, i told her that was inconsiderate of me(no shit) i just dont understand how i can talk about stuff like that to a person going through loss. Tbh not sure if were still friends after this but i think I'd know if we werent.

Ive always done stuff like this, its the reason i end up ghosting people. I would rather them not deal with my shit you know? Then i start to miss them. Its a cycle at this point and i feel like the people that are still around deeply care about me and its only fair to them that i fix this stuff and be a good friend to them in return. Their happiness is what i want.

If anyone read this far im coming here for advice to stop these behaviors, i dont expect a magic answer to it all but any piece of knowledge would be helpful. Thanks",01May2019,1

84,"(I did read the rules, I think this is ok but if not sorry)
My mom is a wonderful person. She’s loving, kind, considerate, everything a mom should be. 
But she has some serious mental health problems that she refuses to seek help for, and I don’t know how to help her. 
We are complete opposites. I’m a fairly well balanced person. She has severe anxiety and I think bouts of depression. Her father was verbally/emotionally abusive when she was young. I think the majority of her issues boil down to that, and while I am *aware* of that, being that my family life has always been safe and supportive, I have a hard time *relating* to that. 
Basically, here are the biggest problems I run into with my mom:
She refuses to believe her kids love her. We tell her we love her. We try to be kind and do what she asks. Of course we fight, like all parents and kids do, but it feels like she takes the fights as meaning we don’t love her, and forgets all the ways we try to show we do love her. 
She panics, instantly, about small things. I know this is common in people with anxiety, but I don’t know how to help. If I need to drive somewhere in the rain or snow, she breaks down. If we’re going to have a very busy weekend, she panics. I don’t know why?
She does not believe she has worth. I know this is a byproduct of how her dad treated her, he constantly told her she was worthless. I guess I can’t expect to change that completely, but is there a way I can help? 
I love her so much, but it gets really frustrating sometimes because she does not *listen*. It doesn’t matter how much we try to say *and* show how much we all love her and what she’s worth to us. The second we have a fight, it’s back to she’s worthless and can’t do anything right. 
I admit sometimes I play the victim and feel like she’s being cruel and irrational. But I try to remind myself that she has genuine problems. If she did not have children to take care of, I’m not entirely certain she wouldn’t have hurt herself by now. And still, sometimes she says things that make me think she plans to hurt herself as soon as we’re grown and out of the house. 
It feels like she’s inconsolable. Nothing we say, nothing we do, ever makes her feel better. She always just has to calm down on her own, after yelling/crying for several hours. 
She demands apologies. When we give the apologies, she never believes they’re genuine. 
Is there anything we can say/do/try that might help? Has anyone ever dealt with a similar person? I’ve been trying to help my whole life but nothing has changed.",01May2019,1
85,"Hi. I have a long history of anxiety , especially social anxiety(maybe agoraphobia?) and really need help so I thought I’ll come on here for hopefully some advice. So this is my story. For as long as I can remember I’ve always been super anxious and really shy. I had a really hard time in school socializing, making friends, worrying all the time(anxiety) and I was also really depressed and super insecure (esp about my weight). Low key struggled with an eating disorder but was never official diagnosed. I remember in school I was known as that super shy weird girl who never talked. Literally kids would ask me all the time why I wouldn’t talk and teachers always commented that I should speak up more. At some point I was even tested for a learning disability and had to go to speech therapy but all was fine except that I was a really sad, shy, and anxious kid. Anyway, things got really bad at 15. My social anxiety and depression became unbearable. I ended up accidentally dropping out of school despite not wanting to and being a straight A student. I just decide to stop going and my parents and I thought it was just going to be for a little while, while I got better however I ended up not going back to school for 1 1/2 years. During this time I was basically completely  home bound only going to target and the bookstore. I stopped talking to all my friends and only spoke to my parents and sister. I also gained a lot of weight which made my self esteem issues a lot worse. Anyway, after 1 1/2 year I kinda freaked out about school and decided to go do online school. I did this for a year and managed to catch up almost completely but sadly not on time to graduate with my class. This was a super depressing time for me. I slept all day and would cry a lot and had some really scary thoughts. I felt like a total loser. Anyways, I decided to go to summer school and then to an adult school to finally finish school. I managed to graduate hs at 19, one semester behind. However since graduating I have sadly become house bound again. It’s been a year and I don’t know how to get help. I really want to make friends and live a normal life. I’m so sick of living like this. Sadly though I think that being at home all the time has made my social anxiety so much worse. I have to fly across the country in a month for my little sisters graduation and I am terrified. I’ll be in a completely different state, surround by people I don’t know, who are expecting me to socialize. I’m seriously so scared. I’m working out and dieting like crazy because sadly I think that my weight might be a really big reason that I’m so scared and insecure about going out. I don’t want to be judged. I’m also just so scared to have to be in such a different environment that i am used to. These are smart people while I’m just a loser who barley managed to graduate hs and has no friends :( any advice would be greatly appreciated:( I’m freaking out and don’t know how I’m going to do this :(",01May2019,1

88,"I'm literally going to commit suicide rn.

Two years ago, I was diagnosed with depression at a really young age because I had been abused both emotionally and physically. What that led to was my low self-esteem and anorexia.

Highschool is garbage. I became diagnosed with anorexia nervosa just because of words. I never ate anything.

To top that off, I cut myself. I feel like I deserve it, like it's a punishment for what I've done. Besides, I felt numb all the time, and I wanted to feel something other than hunger and sadness.

I can't sleep, I can't eat, I can't talk. I'm tired. I had an argument with my friends today, and they said it was my fault. But it was always my fault. Always.

I tried to recover but I can't. I kept falling and crying into the same pit of despair. I felt like whenever I thought I was getting better, I was getting worse. Nothing was helping me.

I'm only on 75mg of Effexor right now, and suggested taking 5mg Lexapro for a week, then upping it to 10mg and stopping Effexor completely, hoping that the withdrawal wouldn't be much because of the new drug in my system.

91,"Not really meant to be a confession, but a simple story. I'm spilling my guts here hoping for some advice or maybe a wake-up call or maybe you just want to read it and move on, that's perfectly okay too.

Around June 2018, I started playing a game that lets you connect with friends and get to know people. I never really wanted to play it seriously but couldn't help that some guy kept talking to me and pulling me towards his group, so I eventually gave in and went with his group to chill and hang out, leading to weeks later where I met this girl.

Within the following next 3 months, after I met this girl, we talked about pretty much anything, music, art, gaming, stupid shit in general, It was great and I love it. We connected on so many things and had quite a lot of the same interests. More than any of my other friends I've ever had in my life and because of that... I fell for her, and I fell hard. At first, she also seemed to show interest until a month after we started to really get to know each other.

To understand why this next scenario happened, you have to realize she is someone who has depression and a very serious case at that. Someone who's going through stuff without any medication or therapy because she doesn't feel like she needs it because her problems aren't ""Therapist worthy"" even though she's absolutely miserable with her life, at least that I can see, so she vents a lot to her friends that she thinks can help her, leading to the serious scenario.

One of her friends she would vent to a lot tried to split with from her and that causes massive damage, causing her to change. Now by all means that it is perfectly acceptable to change after some massive damage to someone's mind like that, I wasn't sad that she did. I was happy until she stopped almost treating me like a friend now. As these feelings grew stronger on my side, they were weakening on hers and you could see it. Started with not talking about the one thing we first connected to, music. Then she stopped starting the conversations most of the time, stopped asking how I felt at all. Sometimes she would vent to me then tell me I'm making it worse which would destroy me. Then the venting slowly stopped happening for a while, the last part of my friend I had left was now gone and I was left with chats like ""You dum lol"" and we'd end chat there for 5 days. 

I brought things like this up a few times but she seemed to turn it towards her only or would brush it all off as a ""My mindset doesn't work like that"" type of deal and I'm not trying to make her out to be the bad guy, because that's not what I want, but that's just what I'm seeing from my point. This brought back the venting to a degree but now I feel like she does it out of pity and on top of that, she feels obligated to talk to me now. Every time I send a text to feels worse and worse and I hate it.

Now to throw salt into the wound, she's insanely jealous of my life. That I have IRL friends and a wholesome family while she doesn't have any of that. Her life around her is toxic, hence why she has very serious depression, which makes me believe she doesn't WANT me but more so needs me. While she was telling me this I felt awful knowing my existence brings her nothing but pain, yet I'm one of her only friends, which yet brings more pain onto my heart knowing that she would most likely not want me there if she had other friends to hang around with. I just can't comprehend why I fell so hard for someone who literally can't stand to be around me, I hate it so much. 

On top of that, I want to break away and move on but I don't know where I stand. Will I send her into a death spiral? Does she even care? Every time I try to bring this it's always the same answers that lead me to believe she wants me around, but her actions show otherwise and on top of that falling for someone who doesn't show any form on interest back leads me to feel clingy and obsessive. which is the one thing I don't want to be, especially towards her. She brings me the best happiness I ever experience and the worst sadness and anxiety I've had so far

Right now my world revolves around this one girl who I haven't even met IRL and It's crushing me. It shows all the signs of a one-way friendship because it seems she's in an ""Output only mode"" from the fallout. Don't get me wrong she has her moments around me where she laughs and has fun but I always feel like I'm bringing her pain or that I'm just ""there"" around her now. Dirt, air, nothing now and she knows how I feel too. I know she doesn't like me back but I can't understand how to move from this.

I want to let her know at least this small bit of how I'm feeling. But I've dumped too much on her as it is and I feel like I've ruined the friendship we once had and now I feel like she's talking out of pity. I just wish for once she'd ask how I was doing.... but it's clear that that won't happen. Sorry if this sounds stupid or creepy, I just needed someplace to put this.",01May2019,2
92,"I’ve been dealing with psychosis and I’ve been pretty set on killing myself lately. I have a psychiatrist appointment and was wondering if that specific doctor has any kind of authority to hospitalize me, or if that’s something a therapist is more inclined to do.

93,"I've lately developed noticable heart pauses. My physician says they could be due to psych meds, that is aripiprazole and tianeptine. I've already decided to taper off tianeptine as it never worked for me, but I'm curious about aripiprazole/anti-psychotics.

I've switched anti-psychotics before due to side-effects, but I can't imagine risking even greater heart-related side-effects by switching, so this seems a lot different to me. Would a doctor consider tapering off and never touching anti-psychotics again?

It's not just the heart-related side-effects either. I never wanted to be on an anti-psychotic in the first place, and I can say I would be much happier (although in some physical pain) without them. I also have other side-effects, most notably akathisia, which is an irresistible urge to move your legs and walk around.

How does tapering off anti-psychotics work?

I've actually attempted to taper off once, but it ended badly. I was mostly dizzy and kind of scared. Never had any symptoms I or my psychiatrist would call ""psychotic."" But I don't remember what exactly I experienced as it was so long ago. My diagnosis is *some other form* of schizophrenia (I don't know more about this), and I experience strong anxiety and depression. My psychiatrist said I had distorted thinking of some sort, but I'm not entirely sure what he meant by that.

Thank You for any responses.",01May2019,1
94,"So I have depression, anxiety and PTSD and the past month has been literal hell for me. I was triggered last month into remembering a trauma that I had buried for psychology reasons (I'm studying psychology and know the mental background for this happening but it's long winded). I've been having multiple flashbacks and panic attacks a day and so have stayed in my room for the majority of the time as I don't want to have a panic attack in public, even though that happened a few times. 

However, I've been trying to get myself out of that hole as my life now is actually pretty great and I want to enjoy it. I have two therapy sessions a week (sometimes more if needed) and am working with my doctor to find the right cocktail of medication to control the chemical imbalance in my head. I went out this weekend to treat myself and went shopping and saw endgame (btw if any of you like makeup, makeup obsession in the uk boots is phenomenal and cheap). I'm more stable now.

Despite this stability I still feel shitty. While I actually feel quite sick I'm just also going back and forth between feeling sad and feeling empty. The reason for this is because of my family. My sister is currently in a mental ward as she has severe psychosis and has come close to death twice this year. However, she's almost died so many times that, while it's really upsetting, it doesn't affect me like it should for others. My parents have always babied her and been kinder to her for as long as I can remember. While I'm an adult with my own life now, she's turning 18 this year and still is treated like a child by my parents. 

What's really upset me today is that I joked that my sister and I are both drop outs of school, even though we are now back in education. My parents response was to praise my sister for all her hard work and it felt like a slap in the face to me. This is a regular occurrence as well. I've developed from having such a severe depression that I didn't think I'd live past 18, to getting to an almost healthy mental state, to figuring out what I want to do with my life, to going to such a shit university that caused my PTSD from several traumatic instances, to going to my first choice university, to now where I'm consistently getting the highest grades despite having chronic pain and my mental illnesses. I barely get any words of recognition. The last time I told my parents my grade (75% which is high for uni), minutes later they were praising my sister over her winning a game of bowling. I just feel as though I can never win their love or attention because I'm the outcast in my family. I'm a bisexual pagan and my family are homophobic and strong Christians. I just want to be loved and acknowledged for my success as it's a really tough battle everyday and I'm winning. 

Sorry for the rant, I just need a place to fully vent.",01May2019,14

96,"I have been seeing my therapist for several months but it feels like every other time I go I dislike him, then the next session will go fine. I've never found a therapist I like to speak to when I'm upset. Only when I'm doing well. I quit my last therapist because she actually got argumentative with me. This guy has flimsy advice I often don't agree with and relies very heavily on empty supportive behavior like saying he's proud of me. I understand that might work for some people but it means nothing to me to hear that someone I barely know is proud of me, or that he knows I will be ok.

He also talks about himself for a bit too long and I noticed this past time he was on his phone a lot while I was talking and never acknowledged it. I figured maybe he was looking something up to show me but he never did, and he takes notes on his laptop so it wasn't that. He downplays everything which may be a good thing in some cases but when it comes to things like thinking my emotionally abusive, narcissistic dad ""just needs a hug,"" it doesn't help me. 

I told him I quit smoking and he assumed I meant cigarettes even though I had never brought up cigarettes ever and he's been wanting me to quit smoking weed, so thanks for solidifying that you don't remember anything about me or look at your notes, dude. Something else that really bothered me was when he tried to get me to punch the air to the Rocky soundtrack to motivate me and I was so embarrassed and kept saying no and he wouldn't let it go. 

But I'm tired of changing therapists this is my 4th, and there are no more to try at the local clinic I go to where my psychiatrist is. I would have to start branching out into private practices at this point. And something this therapist has done for me is to feel more normal, like I'm not crazy just sensitive.

We went out into the woods to a hut that's normally used for bird watching as it was a nice day and a great view. Everyone was drinking playing music and enjoying their selves. I can't actually remember anything but I apparently decided to go for a walk on my own after finishing my bottle and drinking half of someone's vodka.
I was found fitting in a Bush and I had hit my head pretty badly. An ambulance had been called and I was carried to the nearest road and taken to hospital.

I’ve been depressed before (been diagnosed with clinical depression, General anxiety and a panic disorder- but no panic attacks in the past 2 years) but I haven’t taken medication of any kind for it in 8 years. I’ve been lucky enough to be able to use coping skills to keep it at bay. I’m just completely unmotivated, and almost feel dissociated from myself today. The past week back I’ve just been skating by with work and mostly watching greys anatomy reruns. My partner is great and wonderful but even he has noticed something is up because he’s asked me if I’m OK everyday this week. Idk. Just posting this to get it down and see if y’all have any advice.

He was recently hospitalized and put on Trileptal and Zyprexa after a mental break. They initially diagnosed him with Brief Psychotic Disorder; however his outpatient doc doesn't agree. He has terrible mood swings and becomes angry in a flash, then is back to normal in minutes. He seems to do better staying at home lately, but has lost all interest in the things he once loved. He barely showers or brushes his teeth and just seems either angry or sad. He's been on the meds for a month now and they seem to be helping.. But the repetitive thank you has me concerned.

114,"The one person I could always rely on was...my mom. She loved me, and before she would always go to work she'd kiss my forehead and wave goodbye through the black screen door at my old daycare. I was about 5 or 6 at the time, so she left me at that daycare until my daycare babysitter would drop my off at elementary school. Mom said if I ever needed anything, to tell her...and... she'd listen. 

&amp;#x200B;

One day, I was waiting on the couch in the living room to go to school with my younger 4 year old friend lily... we were watching Dora, I remember it so vividly. Everything was normal..until...

&amp;#x200B;

I heard a voice from behind the couch. ***He*** was there. My daycare babysitter's son, let's call him.. Joe. He whispered out to me from behind the couch, ""hey, name, come back here for a second!"". I wasn't very introduced with joe, but all I knew was he was my babysitter's son, and he was an adult, so I had to listen to him. Being the good obedient 5 year old I was, I listened, and lily had gotten bored enough to have wandered into the separate playroom anyways. I went over to him, and he had...a camera with him. He whispered so he wouldn't draw any attention from anyone that was in the house already, ""I need something from you, okay? I need you to pretend to be a model for me...take off your pants."" I was confused, but agreed because I didn't know what was happening, and I didn't know I could say ""no"" to an adult at the time either, I thought it was a game. So I took them off, and he said,""Good, now lay down for me.."". I once again did as I was told, confused about everything. He held my legs above my head, spread them, and started taking pictures. I didn't know what was happening, I just listened. I whispered quietly as he pulled my pants up quickly, ""Was I a pretty model..?"" and that bastard smiled. He smiled, and he showed me those disgusting photos he took. He took a piece of my hair and started playing with it, whispering, ""You're so pretty, name, don't tell anyone what happened, okay? or else..."". I immediately was afraid. I didn't know why, but I was. He got up and quickly went into his room down the hall, and I just sat back on the couch watching Dora as if everything was fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

About a year later, I was six or seven, and figured out what had happened on my own. I was still going to daycare, but on that day... I saw him. I was in the kitchen, and he came in. He smiled and I frowned. ""Remember out little secret?"" he asked, and I backed up a bit. ""Oh, I forgot, you showed me yours..I'll show you mine, okay?"" He showed me his disgusting privates and I backed up even more, I called for my mom and he left immediately.   


The next day, I wanted to tell her what had happened that year ago....

&amp;#x200B;

The one day i needed her to stay..I begged, ""mommy, I don't wanna be here, please, I wanna go with you..."" I begged her until I was sobbing, and she wondered what was wrong..but she didn't wonder for long.

&amp;#x200B;

She walked out the door.. kissed my forehead, waved goodbye through the black screen door.

&amp;#x200B;

and then when she came back i told her what happened..

&amp;#x200B;

And then that bitch...that mother of that son of a bitch....she said, ""now stop making up lies or i'll wash out your mouth with soap"" and i started....crying...

 

i tugged on your shirt, mom...i looked up at you with tears streaming down my face.......i said.. ""mommy i'm not lying, it really happened!""... i needed you to believe me i begged you to believe me....i thought you would....you said if i ever needed you and when i finally did you weren't there..

I have been trying to go to more events to be more active within my school’s community. For example, I went to a huge psychology conference with people from my psychology club. I wanted to back out in the last minute. I was anxiously thinking about what I would say in conversations and whether or not people would judge me. However, I forced myself to go and it wasn’t as bad as I had thought it would be. I’m glad I went. 

I recently applied to be a psyc club member a few weeks ago. Today I got an email saying I was one of the new members! This may not seem like a big deal, but this will be my FIRST college board member position. I did not have a club position since high school( which was years ago). Anyways, it’s going to be a challenge since I am naturally quiet. But I’m really excited for this opportunity.

118," I'm 17. Attending the second to last year of high school,  struggling to find a reason to even get out of bed. Sometimes I skip school for three days in a week because I'm so tired. I don't have any talents and I don't even have reasonable social skills. The girls at school talk shit about me because I'm playing video games to get close to the boys in our class. I just don't see a reason to stay at school anymore, yet I still tried my best to go to school when i'm not trying to cut my head off.

Recently the head teacher of my school's disciplinary team came for me during class and asked to talk to me. He then proceeded to have this talk about how I should not be depressed when the counselling teachers are helping me so much, how I am wasting the school's quotas by not attending school, how I'm enjoying all this attention that the teachers gave me, and how ""can't get out of bed so I skipped school"" is an absolute excuse.. needless to say I was devastated. Cried for an entire week. In class, in shower, in the middle of a bad dream, in the middle of a league of legends game.. anywhere.

123,"So, my biological mom is schizoeffictive-bipolar. She was diagnosed pretty young and shes currently 56. I'm 24 and so far I haven't been diagnosed with a bipolar disorder or any form of schizophrenia so I'm hoping I'm in the clear. I do have the standard depression and anxiety , though, that's fairly severe. 
I love my mom very much and our relationship has been tested and strained over the years but since I made it to adulthood I've made an effort to be as supportive of her as possible. She should have never had kids, so I feel a tremendous guilt for existing and essentially ruining her life. When she has episodes I try and stay as neutral as possible and deal with the abuse to make sure shes safe, and visit her in the hospital every day even if she doesnt want me to. 
Even when shes ""healthy"", though, things are hard. She lives on the other side of the city from me in an assisted living community. I live with my brother and grandparents (her parents). I try to see her atleast twice a week and drive her to get groceries and to docs appointments and to take her for dinner or coffee and sometimes she comes to our place and stays for a day or two. 
The issue is shes super impulsive, which is part of her illness. And very entitled and demanding. If she wants to visit, she calls and expects us to drop everything and go pick her up or run errands for her. It's frustrating because we almost never say no but sometimes we cant go right away and say we can make it in a few hours or so. She'll say okay and then contact my brother, and then my grandpa respectively until she gets what she wants. Theres no compromising. 

Like this past week, there was a problem with my paycheck and I got paid a week late. She called me on my regular pay day and asked if she could borrow money. I told her I was sorry but I hadn't got paid and I literally have no money. I told her she could come over if she didnt have any food, but she just called me an ungrateful liar and hung up on me. The standard is I'm just supposed to pretend it didnt happen and move on the following day, which I did. Yesterday she came to stay at our place for the night. She said she needed to go grocery shopping so the plan was we would go early this morning, as my brother had to go too, and then take her home after. At 730 we got up and she was already gone. She asked my grandpa to drive her home earlier than that, apparently. She later called and asked when I was coming over to take her to the store, and to bring her some stuff she left here. I asked her why she couldnt have just come with us this morning and she just said ""I didnt realize I was such a bother"" and then hung up on me again. Then she called my brother and asked him to take her instead. 

It's really tough. I dont know how to set boundaries with her, shes like a small child. I honestly dont think shes emotionally matured passed a young adolescent. Believe it or not I've made lots of progress setting boundaries in adulthood. This kind of thing frustrates me so much but I dont know if shes actually capable of behaving any other way. I know sometimes she gets spikes of anxiety and that can contribute to her impulsiveness so i try to be as accommodating as possible. When we try to set firmer boundaries she throws a huge fit and has tried to kill herself. This past Christmas she got angry that my brother and I got gifts for my foster family that we still keep in touch with, and she wouldnt talk to any of us other than the nasty messages she would leave on our phones. I was still compelled to go check on her though and try and make up, and get her to spend Christmas with us. We ended up phoning the police to do a wellness check on her and she had overdosed on some sleeping pills so we spent Christmas eve in the emergency with her.

I cant even explain the anxiety I feel when I have to talk to her when shes angry or tell her no, and the guilt I feel for feeling frustrated with her. I'm just so tired and I can barely get out of bed to take care of myself and I have to try and take care of her as well and I'm just failing miserably. 

Thanks so much if you took the time to read this. My family and friends dont understand why I dont just cut off contact with her, but she'd end up homeless or dead if I did that. I cant do that to my mom.",01May2019,1

125,"Hi, I’m 16 years old. I was diagnosed with anxiety and severe depression at 13 and was prescribed Fluoxetine (Prozac). I consider myself living proof that mental illnesses do NOT last forever, and I will give you tips that personally helped me. 
Therapy: To get therapy, you need to book an appointment with your GP first and be honest about how you feel and whether you have self harmed or not. They will most definitely offer you therapy if you ask for it. I live in the UK where you will most likely be referred to CAHMs. If you don’t live in the UK, there is surely somewhere like CAHMs you can go. Keep in mind that some therapists won’t be able to help you because not all therapists think the same, so if your therapist isn’t helping you, it’s not your fault or their fault. You’re allowed to ask for another therapist. Therapy doesn’t fix your problems, but helps you fix them yourself. It really is life-changing when you can click with your doctor. 
Medication: The only medication I can safely talk about it Fluoxetine, after all that is the only medication I have experience with. Fluoxetine does have a lot of negative side effects which can affect only a small amount of people. It takes a few months to settle in and can sometimes be hard to know whether it’s working or if you’re just in a good spot in your life. Overall, I would say it has been helpful for me and I would recommend it. 
Small steps: A small way for me to decrease my anxiety was trips to the shop and back. I learnt in psychology that by doing something that rewards you, you will feel very comfortable doing it again. Bring an unnecessary amount of money if you need to, walk round there and buy something. A drink, food, anything that you feel that is a reward. 
Change your environment: My biggest regret in high school was not changing schools. You must either adapt or change, and if you can’t adapt to your workplace or school, leave. Do not think to yourself “but I only have this much time left ...”. I thought that for five years and I really do regret it! I moved schools eventually and met new people. As someone experiencing anxiety, it was scary at first, but it was VERY worth it. 
I hope this helps and I will be writing something about depression in another thread too. Please don’t hesitate to ask me questions! I would really like to help others. That is why I study psychology now after all.",01May2019,0
126,"I’ve been ridiculously procrastinating for the last few weeks. I always have, but now it kind of hit a breaking point. I come home and im on my phone. Reddit, Twitter, Instagram and Youtube, always switching. For hours on end. I don’t know why i do it. I used to draw a lot or play video games but i just don’t have motivation for that. Now i don’t even turn my computer on. I’m still doing homework but only one night before it’s due. Sometimes I’ve sudden bursts of energy where I would clean my room or something, but now I just do the bare minimum and go straight to bed. 
Weirdly enough, that just something I do at home. I’m rarely on my phone when I’m in school, I doodle and talk to my friends all the time, I’m also always active in class and teachers usually like me, but my grades also started to get worse now since I don’t do anything at home. I started writing out planers etc. but they only help when I get one of those energy bursts. At this point I can’t even get up to my PC to talk to my boyfriend and I can’t really explain to him why. I just don’t have energy when I’m at home.",01May2019,1
127,"I learnt in psychology class that a bad self esteem is created by having unrealistic expectations. We have three versions of ourselves: who we think we are, who others think we are and who we want to be. Sometimes, who we want to be is too far from who we actually are - so we must make it a little more realistic and achieve that first before moving onto bigger steps. 
Nobody talks about the hygiene aspect of depression. One symptom of depression is not having the motivation to take care of your personal hygiene. But, taking care of yourself will become easier if you make it a habit and it can also make you feel very refreshed and better than before. 
Depression does NOT last forever, but it does if you let it. Please try to get out of bed, leave your house, pursue a hobby. You have a lot of potential that you are throwing away and you must realise that sometimes your brain is working against you. Do not give up without a fight. The most rewarding feeling is to come out on the other side and have a story to tell and advice to give that could help others like you.",01May2019,1

There's a huge void in my life and it's in the place where my understanding of myself used to be. Everything seems meaningless. Meager tasks used to be an annoyance, now it's life-altering decisions. The importance of everything I do, everything I see, and everyone, has suddenly vanished, like it was never there to begin with. I don't feel scared, happy, sad, angry, motivated.

138,"I remember before this school year.. or maybe starting in November (sometime early on) nothing started making sense, and I don't feel the same as I used to. I was getting over a girl at the time, who never even gave a fuck about me but I keep trying, and then she basically cut me off even though we were just friends, and then I was upset for a month. But then I started realizing nothing makes me happy like I used to be happy, I don't want to go to college, I pushed all my friends away because I just want to be left the fuck alone. My parents somehow managed to convince me to stay home for college, which I decided last night, instead of going away across the country. I cried as I told my mom to make the deposit to the school 15 minutes away from me. I don't want to go to college, but I don't want to work a minimum wage job. I'm sick of my annoying fucking family who literally won't shut the fuck up. I work on music, but I refuse to sing in this house when my family is judgmental and extremely condescending. I told my dad what my goals are and he laughed. He told me I have no goals. I don't know why I continued to talk to him after that yesterday. He's a fucking dick. You don't tell your son he has no goals. I asked my mom ""is that as good as it gets"" and she said yes. She said if I went away that I wouldn't be any happier. I love my mom, but can that possibly be true? I just want a fucking house, where I can turn my speakers up, and use my voice, and have a strong group of friends. I fucking hate my life.

Thru my whole life I've been very emotional, like extremely emotional. I cry alot. Like an insane amount. I often start crying over anything such as  questions I got wrong in school, rejections of super small things(asking for a friend or asking my parents for something) or even when I'm laughing at a joke.

I always don't understand why I start crying and in my head I'm always trying to stop myself from crying cause there's no reason to but my body does it anyway.

When I get even remotely sad or upset I run away to a quiet place and cry and hyperventilate. I can even start crying over old dumb things such as memories of me slapping my friends butt(as a joke) when I was 7(super weird memory) and other stuff.

146,"Hi, male 18 and have been feeling alienated recently. A couple of years ago I experienced an intense episode of suicidal ideation, I would think of ways to lull myself, etc... it’s not that I was ‘depressed’ as such, it was more like I just didn’t care about anything

Fast forward two years, and I’m over this episode however, since then, I’ve been increasingly aware of how different I am to my peers, especially those of a similar age.  

I don’t care about anything really, well I do, but I seem to just be able to emotionally detach myself from situations. I would never go out of my way to harm someone, but if they were to do me wrong I would have no problem manipulating them in revenge. Because they deserve it. 
 
I have had girlfriends before and experienced what one may call ‘love’ yet I find it hard to be affectionate to my parents. 

A couple of days ago, some boy was being really immature in my private study ( where a group of 100 students study in a room it is compulsory ) and so I just shouted in the middle of private ‘haha that was so funny’ , ironically of course, and aparrt from going red in the face for a couple of minutes, I did not care.

Last year, I was struggling with a marijuana use problem, I would smoke it everyday, crave it everyday and feel intense boredom when I couldn’t smoke. I could not stop. I would take crazy risks just so I could smoke weed. One time, while my parents were downstairs, I ran a bath, opened the bathroom window sat on the window ledge and smoked up. And I didn’t even care. I have done countless similarly stupid things. 

Maybe im over analysing, but I am sure that there is something strangely unorthodox about me. If anyone can relate or has any clue what could be the issue please leave a comment. Thank you",01May2019,0

I had a panic attack because I thought the doctor called me and I was crying cause I thought something must be wrong with me. But no it turns out it wasn’t the doctors office. I am just mentally ill. I live in constant fear. I am killing myself so much. I am scared every day. I feel sorry for the people who need to deal with me or be around me. I hate myself,01May2019,1
149,"It's been probably 10 years since I've been for a non emergency type visit to a doctor. I'm in a not so good place.

I tried to make posts here all week leading up to it with questions, suggestions, etc and I couldn't do it. 

I went in alone and was kind of overwhelmed by how little I know about my health history, but they helped me through the paperwork anyway.

I found out I'm 3 inches shorter than last time, im either shrinking, or my posture has really fucked me up the past 10 years. Not something I expected to learn today.

Once I got into the room and started talking with the nurse about some of my family medical history, I just kind of burst open. Years and years of feelings oozed out of me, I tried to push one of my earphones in to drown them out but this nurse really seemed to care and I just kept talking. 

After 20 minutes or so, she told me how hard everything I said sounded to deal with and that everything was going to be ok, and that she would be right back. She went and talked to the doctor, and the behavioral health person (BHP from here on) and BHP wants to see me right after the appointment with my pcp. 

Appointment with pcp goes fairly normal, some more minor emotional spillage from me, but for some reason found myself having a harder time talking to my Male doctor about the mental stuff, but I tried to be as transparent as possible anyway. Told him some of my tales and background yada yada. 

He prescribed blood work and some zoloft for now. Ok, not really what I wanted, but I'm obviously not doing it right by myself, so ok I'll give it a shot. 

Then I proceed to wait on BHP in the waiting room. 20 mins or so alone in my head. I'm listening to music, holding back tears at every turn, but I'm optimistic. I'm trying something different. And that has to be progress.

BHP comes to waiting room and calls my middle name, at first I'm taken aback and sure she is calling someone else. Then I remember typing in my chart online that I preferred to be called by my middle name, and I almost bust out crying right there. Just that little attention to my preference was a big thing  for me in that moment. Its stupid, but it's true. At this point I've lowered some walls I normally have up, and am feeling apprehensive about doing that, but her calling me by my preferred name allowed me to continue comfortably. 

We get back to her office and I just spill. Everything going through my brain just falls into her lap and again I'm assured that everything is going to be ok. We can get through this. *I* can get through this.

I leave feeling a relief I haven't felt in a long time. 

I'm scheduled to go back after 2 weeks of zoloft and see them both, I'm skeptical but I'm keeping an open mind. 

I think I can do this, and if you feel alone, I think you can too. But the first step is getting some real help. 

For some context, I'm 27 years old with a girlfriend and a kid. I've been dealing with depression my whole life, and outside of a few very short lived stints of paxil and adhd meds, I've always tried to do it on my own.

*ITS NOT WORTH IT*

Please, if you feel like you need help, go get it. My eyes welled up with tears several times writing this, and its because I know I could have started down this path sooner and maybe things would be better for me now. Instead, I'm pretty much starting from scratch at 27. And while I do feel its ""better late, than never"" , I also feel like I've tortured myself unnecessarily for years, where I could have been getting real help.

Please, do whatever it takes to help yourself. I'm not fixed, but for once I can see some light, and for now that's exactly what I needed.

If you're reading this, I truly do care. Go get help if you need it. The resources are there, but you are going to have to be open to the help and aware of yourself.

Good luck, sorry if this is hard to read or scatterbrained, I'm just hoping I can motivate at least 1 other person to take the first step.

152,"Hey,
Two questions:
I’ve been diagnosed with a whole slew of things, and I’m not trying to be a hypochondriac, but I feel like I’m possibly high functioning autistic. 

It’s not something I want to be a crutch, because I know how unhealthy the “crutches” of illness have been in the past for me, but I’ve always had difficulty making eye contact with people. I’ve had people ask me about it, ask me to make eye contact, but whenever I do that I get all nervous and it feels really intimate and I start crying. It might just be PTSD, idk.

Other question:
I have depression, but I feel like I have two different kinds? If that makes any sense at all. I usually have the “meh” kind of depression, where I feel like I’m worthless and everything I do or create is worthless, but I sometimes have this other kind. I refer to it as “violent” depression, because I’m constantly battered by suicidal thoughts and my thoughts are really loud and layer over each other. I’ll hear like six streams of thought almost once and I usually use headphones to drown it out. The other aspect of “violent” depression is this overwhelming anxiety and this feeling that I’m going to hurt someone/myself.

I’m letting you know right now I have never self-harmed or felt the urge to do so, but it’s lmore like I’m afraid of doing that, like my body and mind are disjointed and I’m not in control. It feels like staring over a cliff’s edge-it’s not a desire to fall, it’s a fear of falling.

Anyway, I thought I’d ask. I know you aren’t medical professionals or anything, so I do plan to eventually go to a psych doc.

I’m on Wellbutrin/Bupropion 150. I’ve tried Prozac before and it was HELL. I was later tested and my paperwork shows that Prozac was one of the worst prescriptions I could be given.

Also, I’m not going anywhere, so don’t be worried about that either. 

Thank you for reading.",01May2019,1
153,"Okay, so this is going to sound weird.  
To make a long story short, my mom's been abusing me for years and bangs on my door/slams things/yells when she's angry.  
Basically, I can't handle loud or sudden noises anymore. When I hear them, I start remembering different times where my mom's gone off the rails.  I immediately start feeling like I have to protect myself, even if I'm nowhere near her. Even when I'm in public, it can happen. It's not like I forget where I am or anything, but when I hear loud or sudden noises I feel like my mother is about to burst into the room and start shouting or trying to attack me.

And it's not like I can freaking tell my friends what's going on with me, I've tried that, and it only leads to me being angry because they don't fully understand what I go through. But how can I be mad at them, I constantly try to explain my situation to them because I'm currently not allowed to visit a psychiatrist, so it's like I keep trying to seek help within my friends. But I have to keep telling myself that they aren't psychiatrists and they can't help me the way a real one can.

I am in physical and mental pain everyday. Everyday feels like I have less and less reasons to still be here.

The few messages I have received either so responding to me or turn out to be some kind of scam. I've been in medication, I've done therapy, nothing really helps. My own doctor doesn't even ask me to come see her anymore.

So what is there left? When you're all alone all the time and the only people you converse with are online and may as well just be an imaginary friend.

What am I even doing anymore. Why can't the pain just stop. Why can't it all just stop. Why am I even writing this. Just more screams into the void. I didn't matter yesterday, I didn't matter today, and I won't matter tomorrow. I just want a rest from the torment that is living.",01May2019,1

163,"I’m a good person. I work hard. I make sure everyone is happy. Or I try to. I’ve done everything by the book. I’m a good man and an honest soul. But people WOULD be better off if I was dead. My parents are nice people. But should they be married? Hell no. Together than can become the most volatile angry monsters I’ve ever seen in my life, I’m surprised one of them hasn’t killed the other. Why are they together? Because of me. In my mother’s numerous fits of rage “if it weren’t for (them) having a child (me) together they’d be happily divorced with better lives”. As a kid, hearing my mother wish my father drink himself to death while shattering our stuff and then saying she’s only with him because of me, putting her happiness on the line, makes me feel like a fucking monster. And then she turns around and say I’m the only good thing in her life. I simultaneously take her happiness away while giving her all the happiness she has left. Seven, seven years old I was when I first thought of killing myself. Watching my parents growing up in such an extremely volatile scenario made me stray away from relationships for many years, for fear it was all like my parent’s relationship. It was not until about 4 months ago, at the age of 20, that I started to date. Freshly inexperienced, I met a girl my age who’d had 5 more years of sexual experience over me. She knew this going in, and said it was okay. Eventually we had sex but my anxiety, thoughts of my parents fighting, performance anxiety, and self-doubt caused me to get E.D. during sex, every single time. 2 weeks ago, she had an affair with her ex. She said she couldn’t control herself and that the feelings she had with him overwhelmed her, but I fear more it’s because of my E.D. and lack of ability to sexually gratify her. Now she hates herself because she’s a cheater. If I didn’t exist, my parents could’ve gotten divorced and actually had good lives, and my gf wouldn’t feel like a monster because she wouldn’t have had to cheat.
