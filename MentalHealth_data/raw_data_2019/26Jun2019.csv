0,"I’ve been prescribed Xanax for my anxiety for years, and today I told my doctor about the depression I’ve been feeling lately, so he opted to have me transition to Cymbalta. I’m terrified of experiencing withdrawal symptoms, and moving away from something I’m sure works for me to an unknown. Does anybody know if it will be okay?",26Jun2019,1
1,"I can’t take it anymore. Living at home with 2 abusive parents is brutal and the most mentally draining thing. I’m tired of the nightmares, being afraid of being home, the stress I experience in my relationships and work. I’m so depressed I don’t even have enough energy to move my body. I call out for help everyday hoping something will take me out of here. My boyfriend knows of this but I can’t move in with him and his family. My friend invited me to live with her but she’s 2 hours away from everything. I’m a full time student and I can’t work more until I get my degree. I’m stuck and suffering. Everyday I feel like giving up.",26Jun2019,1
2,"So since about the beginning of last year, I’ve noticed that my life, my worldview and many other things about me have changed. I used to be a funny, talkative, outgoing person, but now i am an introverted, self loathing heap of rapidly changing emotions and distorted views about the people I surround myself with. I commonly get the feeling that everyone I know secretly hates me, or is in on some joke about me that i don’t know about. Sometimes i find it difficult to breathe or talk in one on one situations, no matter who the person is. My limbs are almost always quaking and i find it difficult to control my actions sometimes. Occasionally i subconsciously put on a different voice when talking to different people and act differently around different people. Sorry for the wall but this is some shit I’ve wanted to get off my chest for a while now. If you have any insight on what could be wrong with me please let me know.",26Jun2019,1
3,"Mental illness does not discriminate. While it isnt confirmed or ""sanctioned"" it does appear to be suicide. Mental illness doesnt care how many followers you have, what content you produce, how funny you are online. Statistics show young black males are higher risk, often undiagnosed. Regardless of statistics and bullshit numbers, the point is, psychiatric illnesses are REAL and should be treated the same way as diabetes, cancer, or a common cold. The stigma has to end. You may be  sick but you are also worthy and you deserve happiness.

4,"I know that title sounds like a nonsense but please - hear me out. TW rape, pls be warned.

When I was younger, I had terrible anxiety (I suppose it was that), panic attacks, several phobias. I felt like every emotion I had, I felt strongly. Even joy or excitement. When I was happy I was happy. Moreso than others perhaps. I was a ticking bomb. I had no control over my emotions. I especially cried a lot (in public) for the smallest reasons and couldn't stop myself from it. I was hurting myself. My life was a roller coster.

Not for the last year or so.

Lately I've been feeling weird. I haven't been anxious in a long time. I haven't cried in a year though I cried almost daily before. I just feel totally numb. I don't feel anything.  I don't feel joy anymore. I don't feel excitement for anything. I feel like my life has no purpose and that I have no future. I feel like I have no will to live but I also have no will to kill myself, I'm not suicidial. I don't feel love. I have no ambitions. I don't care what someone thinks about me although I cared very much before. I don't care if I'm in contact with my friends. I'm an empty shell only surviving like a robot.

The closest I come to feeling emotional is when I start having some flashbacks to my past triggered by some random things I read on the internet or that someone tells me. I had some potentially traumatic things happen to me in the past, yet I don't know if I'm traumatized. I was bullied pretty badly when I was a kid. I was in an abusive relationship with a sociopathic person. I was raped (?) or rather taken an advantage of when I was passed out (alcohol and perhaps I was rooffied, not sure though).

The thing is I don't feel anything about this stuff, I only feel weird because I think I should feel bad that those things happened to me. Like I feel odd that I don't care. I remember the bullying or the abuse very well, it's objectively nasty and it definitely left a mark back then, I hated myself, I cried - it was terrible. But now it feels like someone else's memory. I don't know how to describe it. I know those things happened to me but I don't emotionally feel like it. When it comes to the rape thing, I don't feel like it happened to me at all. I can recall everything since I woke up from the passing out. I remember the guy fucking me, I remember how dizzy I felt and how I couldn't move. I can empirically describe what happened but I don't have any emotional response to that. It's like... It's neutral. I never felt anything about it. I'm just a bit disturbed by my reaction to that. Because I should be sad and disgusted. And I'm not. I don't know what's wrong with me.

And I don't know if I should be happy that my anxiety is gone. But I miss it. I miss feeling things. Maybe I'm alright. Maybe it's a good thing that I don't feel traumatized or that I don't give a fuck about anything. Maybe that's how healthy people should feel and I just don't know it because of my past. But my rational part wonders if it is. I honestly don't know. I confuse myself. I don't want to spend money on therapy if this is how normal healthy person should feel.

I just feel like I want a diagnosis for what's going on because it would give me an answer. But when I was younger, I was hospitalized after I tried to seriously hurt myself, placed on a suicide watch and treated by psychiatrists. They never diagnosed me with anything, their report said that I'm an immature personality and I was basically told that I'm a drama queen and perhaps that's what I am.

I don't want to waste some therapist's time if I'm just overthinking. Oh boy. Please, give me an advice.",26Jun2019,2
5,"So, I know how I’m going to do it. It will happen tonight. I’ve said goodbye to all my family and they don’t know yet. That’s the saddest part, them. It’s always about them though. I don’t have to hurt anymore. I’ve never been so happy. Tonight I’m done. I don’t have to worry anymore. Besides, when I’m gone it won’t matter. It won’t matter one damn bit.

6,"Etika was a youtuber, son, and friend to many. He showed the signs, in clear daylight. Many people would clown him, make up of what was happening, or even play into it. We don't know what mental illness he had, (bipolar 1 is the most common thing people think) but whatever it was he lost the battle with it. He pushed away everyone, and many people gave up on him after his multiple suicide threats. But what we need to learn from him is how fame, being in the spotlight, can change and ultimately hurt people. You can get high off it and crave the attention  so much you do really stupid things. Things you can't reverse. 

When he had the police at his door, had an entire street in Brooklyn shut down, because fan were worried about him and he was yelling out his window and refused to let the cops know he was okay, that's when i knew something was very wrong. But you know what's worse? Afterwards, when he was taken to a mental hospital they let him go, the same day, and said he was ""agitated"".  This wasn't the only time he was in a mental hospital either. This speaks a lot about the mental health system. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, I want everyone to know don't let social media consume you. Don't let fame consume you. Don't let this pressing feeling of needing to be someone in order for people to like you consume you. You are you, not some image people expect you to be. Don't sacrifice who you are to keep an image up, you'll hurt yourself in the long run.",26Jun2019,161

8,"The title explains it pretty much.
I feel like I’m manipulative and fake because I don’t feel like the person I show myself to people is not who I am at all.
I do this thing where I see someone I absolutely adore/ admire/ idolize and I pick things I like from their personality and consciously make myself do them. 
I know a lot of people mirror people’s actions, and it’s a very common thing? But I do it consciously and with the intent for people to like me, adore me, and love me. 
I feel like I am a complete fraud? I put so much effort into it that after most interactions with people, I feel exhausted and drained because the entire time I had to ‘pretend’.
The thing is it works, it works so well. People adore me just like how I want them to, I can make people do what I want but? I don’t feel happy at all.
I feel like I’m not me, like I completely designed &amp; fabricated my personality. I feel foreign to myself. 
I don’t know what to do, because I’m in too deep? I can’t just stop because I have so many eyes on me, and I want to stop but at the same time I’m not sure because if I stop getting the attention I want, then I’m nothing.",26Jun2019,1
9,"I have been having a reoccurring intrusive thought for the past 8 months. I imagine myself cutting my lips off with scissors and hacking at my teeth. I can’t explain what triggers it, sometimes it is when I’m completely happy or feeling blue. I have random intrusive thoughts that come to me at random times anyway but this is a recurring one.

13,"Hello, I believe I might have inattentive ADD, but I am not sure yet. I went to the therapist for the first time yesterday, and as I was explaining my mental health with him, he brought up the fact that it is possible I might have ADD. 
I am 18, and my anxiety/mental state has definitely took a dip within the last two years of my life. I left public school halfway through sophomore year to start online school, because I was fed up with the other kids at my school/the school in general. I was being bullied about multiple things, so once I had enough with it, I told my parents I wasn't going to that school anymore. 
Talking with my mother on the car ride home, I explained to her how my brain works, and I asked how her subconscious works, which of course was quite a different answer than how mine works. I am heading back to the therapist next week to run tests and figure out what is going on for sure, but I am impatient, and would like to know as soon as possible that I finally came to the crossroads of what has been messing with my mental all my life. My mother is pretty upset with herself for not being able to ""catch the signs"" of me having it, but I'm trying to let her know it's still early in my life, and it wasn't too late to catch it. 
I'm sorry for the long background, but here are some of my symptoms/thought processes

-I have no energy to do things that I dont want to do, or sometimes even do want to do.
-Sometimes I have to reread something 2 or 3 times just to retain the information because my mind was focusing on something else, or nothing at all. 
-My social skills are affected because it is hard to hold a normal conversation, because my mind drifts into other thoughts mid-conversation, sometimes I forget what I am saying or what we were talking about mid sentence.

I was wandering if anyone else randomly thinks about horrible things happening to you or someone else or something that could happen. Like killing or torturing people in horrible ways. I do but sometimes its not random, I just feel some type of way or something random happens that triggers them. For example i was driving home from work the other day and its summer so its really hot, then all of a sudden i starting thinking about how hot the sidewalk was, then i thought what if someone tied or nailed someone onto the sidewalk and left them there to overheat or stare at the sun, then i thought what if you left them there and started burning them with a iron or something.

20,"Hi everyone, I'm not really sure where to begin. A few months ago, a lot happened at the same time and I think it affected me mentally. My grandma passed away and I didn't get to say goodbye, I had an upcoming surgery that I was afraid of, I decided to take a long month break from marijuana (I used to smoke almost daily due to stress and depression). My fiancé and I were arguing a lot, often about silly things, but sometimes about more serious/important topics. I was also very overwhelmed and stressed out at work. I am bipolar and have depression. I take medication for both (for about two years now). I used to take them as a teenager too, but stopped during college and did well off of them until a traumatic event in my life a couple of years later knocked me back to self-destructive behavior. After a year of that, I decided to go see a psychiatrist and was put on medication and have since gotten better. 

Anyway, beginning that month (a few of months ago), I suddenly went to work and realized everyone looked different to me. It was very strange and I was honestly a bit creeped out. I couldn't identify any single trait that had changed, but altogether, every single person's face that I looked at looked like a different version of themselves to me, as if something was off. I looked at my fiance, he looked different. My coworkers, my friends, ME. I remember looking in the mirror and not completely recognizing myself. Again, I couldn't identify any single characteristic that had changed, but something was off. I looked like an alternate version of myself. That was a few months ago, it slowly died down over the following months; people started looking familiar again, even me. Now they only look different (myself included) every once in a while. I don't remember being stressed during the times in which people look different now, but it's possible I may have just forgotten.

I don't know if any of this makes sense, or if I should be worried, but I decided to post about it and see if I could get some feedback, and I was wondering if anything like this has happened to anyone here. Maybe it was the stress? I don't know.

21,"I'm new here and I just need to vent.

The past few months I have been doing everything in my power to make my wife happy, I've burned out mentally, physically, and emotionally doing this, and all this time she has waited to tell me that she's not in love with me and she's leaving as soon as she finds a job in a different city. She did this knowing mentally I was one string away from going into the behavioral health hospital, but she lands that she didn't want to spend time with me anymore so she could prepare me for her to leave. Why is it that someone who does everything that they can to make one person happy, that's has almost died for them(I've been walking in 100°+ weather to get what she needs, even if it's 2-5 miles away for the past month) and they put in maybe 2% and they just want to leave?

Mentally I have been absent, abandoned, and left as a hollow shell. My anxiety is high every day, I'm depressed and can't get out of bed, I'm angry all the time, I lose track of time, I haven't been able to eat or sleep since she told me(Sunday) and the fact that she says she's not happy because she's the only one stressed out, that she is the only one who basically can have feelings and input on what's going on doesn't just hurt, it irritates me that she thinks she's the only one going through something rough.

I’m a 22 year old male, and I got a testosterone test a couple months ago with a level of 560. The chart said it was in average range, but I honestly feel like I have all the symptoms of low testosterone.

I used to run 5 time a week (2 miles), but had 20% body fat, I’ve been severely depressed for the past 6 years with minimal friends, lately I’ve struggled with sleep (sleeping 10 hours a day). I’ve also seemed like I’ve gave up on life in the past few years. I used to be academically gifted, and I even excelled my first two years of college. My depression got worse towards the end of sophomore year, and I started caring less and my performance showed. I never had a girlfriend, and I’ve had a huge porn addiction that I’ve been trying to fix. Lately that addiction came back.... I’m not sure what to do.... it seems like my life is spinning out of control, and I’m completely lost... I feel like a complete kid right now.

I have suffered previously from depression and anxiety problems, but I’m unsure of how long I’ve really been depressed, or if it’s all in my head. I moved back home in order to get a grip on my mental health (I’m continuing my education beneath my parents roof), but I’m constantly irritable and stressed out for seemingly no reason why.

I’ve talked to my mom about these things multiple times, but she keeps telling me that I am asking for attention or that I “want to be depressed”. I don’t want this. Ever since I started middle school, my personality changed a lot; I used to be extremely outgoing and extroverted, and now I am much more introverted and I prefer to be alone or with one person only. There’s nothing wrong with that, but I’ve also noticed (and so have my parents) that I’m drawn to “dark” things, such as horror and psychological things that are interesting, and sometimes these things involve suicide/self harm/etc. I am not suicidal, nor do I harm myself, but a change occurred in me a long time ago, and I am unsure how to cope with the stresses that this has put upon my life now. 

I’ve visited a therapist before, and while my symptoms and answers to a questionnaire were congruent with depression and severe stress, I still am unsure whether it’s true or not. I took medication before for my anxiety (I am off of it now), and it only made my nightmares and insomnia worse. I can’t talk to my family about it because they will tell me I’m making it all up for attention. 

As a result of this, and other uncontrollable circumstances (living at home as a junior in college, knowing that my family is disappointed in me, being labeled as the “problem child”), I lash out at the people I love the most and the people who are there for me. At least, I only seem to lash out at my family. I never treat my boyfriend like that, and I really don’t know why...my parents say that once he finds out how I really am, that he will leave me. 

I just want to get help. I want to know what to do, to change my behavior for good. I’ve tried many, many times, and sometimes it seems like I’m going somewhere...and then something happens. My family isn’t perfect and it can be dysfunctional at times. I’m not perfect, and I will admit, wholeheartedly, that I am dysfunctional at times. I just don’t know where to go from here.

Answering phone calls is worse. It makes me feel physically nauseous when my phone rings... And the number attached to my phone prior me owning it, has a lot of credit collectors phoning.

33,"Probably the millionth vent post on here today. Not sure what I’m looking for other than just a place to organize these thoughts. Maybe someone with similar experiences? Maybe any kind of armchair diagnosis to point me in some direction?

Recently I’ve been struggling with some feelings - or rather, lack thereof. I’m a huge adrenaline junkie, and spend most of my free time in sports like freeride mountain biking, free solo rock climbing, or skiing. I absolutely live for the high that these give me, but I’m worried that it’s only a bandaid over some deeper issues. When I’m not getting that rush, I practically shut down; I don’t feel anything aside from occasional surges of anger at the smallest things. I keep up friendships and my grades, but mostly because I feel like that’s what I’m supposed to do.

What recently has me worried is that I’ve turned to pain to get that rush when I don’t have time to get it through sports. Sometimes my brain just feels empty and I need to hurt myself to jumpstart it. It doesn’t come from a place of self-hate, rather just something I seem to need in order to function. 

I don’t think it’s depression, because there’s no sadness or self-hate. Shit, it’s not even general apathy. I know other people must have experienced this, but I haven’t really heard of anyone with the same shit cocktail of issues. 

Thanks to anyone that read through this stream of consciousness, or at least skimmed it. It feels cathartic just to put it out there.",26Jun2019,1
34,"So I've been with this girl. We had a little bit of a history a few years ago, then fell out of touch when she moved to another city, but reconnected. 

It's been wonderful. We agree on all sorts of things that I never thought I'd find another person to agree with on -- how relationships should be structured, the need for each person to have their individual space, the merits of ethical non-monogamy, that having a party celebrating how much you love someone is great but marriage is stupid, and the list just goes on. Neither of us want kids, we have the same political and religious views, we have all the same kinks, everything. Most importantly, we're the only two people who know and understand exactly how shitty and insane our past relationships were, because we were both there for most of it. Stuff that would take me a hundred hours of talking to try to explain to another person, she already knows. 

So obviously, I'm head over heels in love. But, from the very beginning, I knew that feeling was a touch one-sided. I was the one who said that was ok; I was just happy to have been alongside her for a part of our journey through life, and everything else was bonus. And I meant it. I still mean it. I just want her to be the happiest, most fulfilled version of herself she can possibly be and want to help in any way I can with that, even if it's not as a significant other. 

So a really great year goes by, and during a normal conversation a couple days ago, she breaks down and tells me she feels so guilty. The emotional disparity on her part hasn't gone away, even though she's tried so hard to come to love me the way that I love her. She says that I'm so good to her, better than anyone she's ever known, and she feels like she's using me. We share so much, and we have so much in common, and I'm sweet and good and... yeah, all that stuff, whatever... but that it's just not happening. She doesn't know why, she can't explain it, but she doesn't love me like that. She loves me, and cares very deeply about me, but isn't in love with me.

I knew that. I'm good at reading people, I 100% knew that was coming someday. I had already predicted it and we'd talked about it and I'd reassured her that it was ok a few times over the last year. 

So I told her it was ok, that I understood, that there's nothing wrong with her and I'm not angry with her and sometimes that's just how it goes. There are at least a dozen problems I can name off the top of my head that could contribute to that which are perfectly reasonable; for starters, she's 10 years younger than me (she's 27) and her ultra-conservative family hates me (long story).

I suspect a big part of it also is that she's not especially sexually attracted to me; she'd never admit that (I asked, got a dodge, and never followed up because -- why do that to myself?), but I'll be honest, nobody's ever taken a good picture of me and it's not the photographer's fault. And it doesn't help that she scores a smidge higher than 3 on the Kinsey scale, if you catch my drift. Again, nobody is to blame here.  

So, the prophecy has come to pass, and we kind of broke up, I guess? Or, rather, it has been solidified that we're not going further than best friends with occasional limited benefits, and I don't know the status of said benefits now either but that's not particularly important right now.

What's important is, in spite of what I said I felt, and in spite of how I WANT to feel, I'm fucking destroyed. I don't know why. I knew this was coming. I watched it coming from a great distance, and thought I was ready for it, and ok with it. I really do just want her to be happy. I only want her to be with me if she 100% wants to be with me. Some internet shrink I saw on YouTube once used the phrase: ""only if you want to do it with the same enthusiasm as a child feeding the ducks,"" and that's exactly how I feel. I don't **want** her to have to make herself love me. She deserves no less than to be with a person who makes her feel the way she makes me feel. 

The thought of her having sex with someone else really doesn't bother me -- for whatever stupid reason, I'm just not wired with a jealousy circuit like that. I am, however, wired with an envy circuit, and the thought of her being googly-eyed over someone else -- for whatever stupid reason -- cuts me way more deeply than it should. 

I don't regret any part of this last year, not for a second. Talking to her and being around her has led to so many positive changes in my life, real, significant, important positive changes that I'd never have come to without her. I wouldn't do anything differently. 

But I'm still totally fucking destroyed. I haven't told her that, and I won't, because that's just manipulative and encourages her to feel guilty over something she has no control off and that's a shitty, awful thing to do to anyone. But I haven't left the house, I haven't showered, I don't even think I've brushed my teeth, for the last three days. (Don't worry; now that I've thought of that last one I'm taking care of it as soon as I post this.) I spent most of today sleeping. I don't even have the wherewithal to play a video game that involves interacting with other people; I've been replaying the 2016 DOOM and I'm sure my Overwatch and Elder Scrolls Online friends think I've died. I've barely interacted with my roommate; even his adorable little pet hedgehogs aren't coaxing a smile from me. 

And I am kind of angry. I'm not angry at her, I'm just... angry. It seemed like we would be such a perfect fit, personality-wise and beliefs-wise and sex-wise, and I'm totally convinced that there's literally nobody else I'm ever likely to meet who's going to check all those boxes that we checked together. In all my life up to this point, she's been the only one. I feel like... I feel like this was my only real shot at not spending my life alone. If even she can't love me, who can? Who the fuck can? And why am I like this, that there's one woman out of ~3.5 billion who even had a chance to? That's why I'm angry. 

I'm angry at the universe, which I had only just recently stopped seeing as a conscious malevolent entity that enjoys causing pain and misery to humans, that rewards the people who cause the most pain with fame and fortune and punishes the people who don't cause enough pain with ill health and bad luck. I had just started to see the universe as a neutral place where good and bad things happen but it's not really a conspiracy, and now this; this series of circumstances and events that, if I was some kind of evil movie villain out to make someone suffer, I couldn't have planned better. Somehow I'm supposed to believe that the random vagaries of life have caused me more pain in a more complete way than the most fiendish engineerings of my worst enemy ever could have? 

I KNOW that's fucking stupid. I know it is. I know all of this is fucking stupid on my part. That's why I haven't told anyone. It's just all the way around fucking stupid. There's no part of what I'm feeling right now that isn't fucking stupid. 

But I can't help it. I'm trying so hard to force myself to not be angry and sad and massively disappointed. I am the master of my own mind, I am enlightened about the transient, lopsided way in which love frequently works. I'm **glad** she told me because I don't want her to feel obligated to me in any way. I don't want her to feel guilty, or ashamed, or resentful, or anything bad. I don't want her to pretend she loves me if she doesn't. I'm glad to know. So why am I still such a fucking wreck right now?

We've talked a few times since then, and I obviously haven't hinted at any of this. I've been outright lying to her about being fine, which makes me feel worse because I don't ever want to lie to her, but what constructive purpose could the truth possibly serve here? She hasn't done anything wrong. This isn't her problem and I'm not going to make it her problem. I'm not going to cry in her lap while she soothes me and feels like shit over it. 

That said, she's also the only person I would talk to about this kind of problem. My roommate's great, but he's kind of an All-Logic, Limited-Emotion kind of guy, and he'd propose lots of great, practical, useful solutions to my problem that I'm just not equipped to put into practice and he'd get confused and frustrated with me. And that's not his fault either.

I don't know what to do. I have nobody I feel like I can talk to, and I just want to get the fuck over this and go back to being generally happy with my life. I'm useless to anyone like this, and it's all over a thing **I saw coming almost a year ago and thought I was fucking prepared for**. 

It's the weirdest feeling. I still want her to be happy, I'm rooting for her to find someone awesome so she can feel the way I feel. I wish her no ill will whatsoever. Which kind of makes it worse, because there's no one to blame for it except myself, even though I'm reasonably sure I couldn't have done anything that would have made her fall in love with me when it just wasn't there. Which means there's noone at all to blame, which means all this sadness and anger just... floats around, with no target, nothing to aim it at, and no ready answers on what I can do to get rid of it. **And I shouldn't even be feeling it in the first place!** I was **prepared** goddamn it!

Argh. Ok, I've ranted enough, I'm sorry. I just needed to vent and I didn't know where else to do it. Thanks for humoring me. Much love to all of you!",26Jun2019,1
35,"Hello all you wonderful people! I hope you are having a beautiful and healthy day!

I have a question for the community, and any feedback is appreciated. 

You see, my friend and I are curating an art exhibition showcasing artists who experience mental illness, and we are struggling to find the right “slogan” mainly because we are unsure as to how to refer to mental illness. 

On a more personal note we both experience mental illness and both are artists. That inspired the idea for the show. 

With mental health becoming more and more in the spotlight I am wondering what’s better to say? Mental “illness” or mental “health” or mental “wellness”?? Is this splitting hairs? Does it really matter? Are people offended or is there stigma attached to the word illness? Are the they all one and the same? Is struggling with mental health the same as a life long illness?  We want to be respectful, yet get people talking about mental illness. 

I’d like to get a dialogue going about this to educate myself on how people feel about this topic. 

Thanks for reading!

Ps. I’m new to reddit, and am still figuring out the app. So if I delay in response this is why. 

Thanks in advance!",26Jun2019,1

38,"The people around me may not notice, but I think I am just about to hit rockbottom.

I look like someone with a wonderful life. Highly educated. Great job in a prestigious organization. Travelling around the world. Meeting my idols.

But now I have ended all that. I quit my job, which burned me out and made me disillusioned about my passion in life. I turned down all offers to make me stay. I take comfort on having funds that will last me for half a year, and on my half-hearted attempts to look for a new work that will actually give my life value. I continue meeting friends, giving mechanical responses on what I plan to do from now on.

I don’t have a plan though. And I don’t want to have a plan. 

I felt that I am too close to my dreams, and just a little effort will make me achieve everything. Why didn’t anyone tell me that this is such a sad place? I am looking for motivation that I am doubtful I will ever find again. 

I am too close yet too far from my dreams, if that makes any sense. I never felt as empty as I do now. I just want my six months to run out. How do I make myself self-combust? I just want to turn into dust.",26Jun2019,2
39,"(If you dont want to read the back story please scroll down and read my symptoms, I really need any type of help, advice or ideas)

Background: I've struggled with anxiety,OCD, low self-esteem and depression most of my life. My mom has depression and major depressive disorder.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to the point, at the end of december last year, I took 2 tabs of lsd with some friends. It started off okay, but it was much more intense than any other psychedelic experience i've had. Since i was having fun, me and my friends decided to hit my wax pen. As soon as we did that, I started feeling extremely paranoid and anxious. I ended up spending the rest of the trip laying in my friends bed with extreme paranoia, anxiety, and thought loops. I was just wishing for it to be over. I stopped smoking weed every day after this, and ended up only smoking on weekends.

&amp;#x200B;

2 days later, being the idiot I am, I took MDMA. My seratonin was already fucked, so after the comedown I had the worst depression I've ever had. I also had a huge existential crisis. I realized that I had a horrible fear of death. I kept looking up what happens after death for about a week, just freaking myself out. Eventually I got over it, because I realized that whatever does happen is out of my control.

&amp;#x200B;

After that life went on like normal for a while. I smoked on weekends with friends. and spent some time with my family.

&amp;#x200B;

About a month later however, I got way too high and ended getting what I think is depersonalization. After this I quit smoking weed/ It took me about 3-4 months, but it was really getting better and had almost went away. I stupidly smoked (at the end of may) and it came back full swing.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm here. I dont know if what i've been experiencing this whole time is depersonalization. Im afraid i may have suffered ego death or something. These are the symptoms I've been having

\- I feel really small and insignificant

\- I envy anyone who can live a normal life without viewing it like this

\- I have constant fatigue

\- I stay up super late and sleep really late into the afternoon

\- I feel completely hopeless, like there is nothing I can do 

\- I find no pleasure in anything anymore

\- I feel almost no emotion

\- I have really bad suicidal thoughts

\- I've gained a lot of weight

\- I have terrible brain fog

I dont know what to do at this point.",26Jun2019,1

Ive been in therapy since high school. Can anyone out there relate to these circumstances? What do you know now that you wish you knew before?

Recently I've had the luck to find really good friends and I really wished for a girlfriend or a boyfriend because I want to give love to someone in that way. Today I realized I do want to experience that, but the real reason I want to give and receive all that love is because I don't love myself. I thought I finally did, but it wasn't true.

42,"(This is a throwaway account) For as long as I can remember, I have been depressed. I've never felt like I had any support or anyone I could talk to. My sister has anxiety, and my mom was always there for her and did everything to be there for her. I guess I learned to just push my feelings down and do everything I could not to show anyone that anything was wrong. My mom never noticed anything was wrong with me, and the times I would have panic attacks or would exhibit signs of being depressed, my mom ignored it or treated it like I was just having a bad day. When she found out I was cutting myself in middle school, she yelled at me, grounded me, and even took pictures of the self harm. A couple times, I tried actually telling her that something was wrong, but it could never come out right. I think I am physically incapable of actually saying ""I am depressed, I need help."" I went to a therapist once, she asked me why I came into therapy and I started sobbing and I couldn't say anything. I never went back to therapy after that one visit and it was never brought up again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I am living on my own. I am miserable all the time. I cry every day. I am (knowingly) irresponsible with my money, my health, everything. I dropped out of college after one semester, but didn't tell anyone. Everyone I know thinks I am still in college but it has been 6 months and I'm just lying to them. I have no real friends. I have no one I can talk to and no one who cares about me, other than my family but I can't talk to them about it, for reasons I said above. I get so irrationally angry sometimes, I get angry at people around me for not caring about me because I wish they did. I feel so lost and hopeless, I feel like nothing will ever get better. Sometimes I think about doing something drastic so I will get put into a mental hospital, so people will finally know how much I have been suffering for all these years, as a cry for help. But I know I won't, I will just keep being miserable every day of my life. Nothing brings me joy, nothing seems like it's worth it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wish I could tell someone that something was really wrong with me. But I don't know how. If anyone ever asks me if I'm okay, I have to choke back tears and tell them that I am doing fine, because I have no idea how to be honest, how to tell someone that I am not okay at all and that I am just depressed. How do you reach out for help if even the thought of telling someone what is going on brings you to tears? I think if I even went to a therapist I wouldn't be able to tell the truth.",26Jun2019,1

45,"I need help. My father about 8 years ago got Lyme disease. Ever since then he’s been different. It was a very slow change. The first thing I noticed was he began having a love of alien conspiracy theories. He used to watch ancient aliens like it was the Bible and would be constantly looking up ufo videos online. He believed 2012 was going to be the end of the world and wanted to buy a shelter. Then this behavior began to die down and we thought it was a phase. 

Then a couple years ago my father’s kidney began to fail and he had to go on dialysis for a year. It was bad, he was bedridden once he got home and despite my family’s attempts ( I could of tried harder) was very isolated from the rest of us.

This is when things got really bad. My dads conspiracy theories went full tinfoil. He believed the government was hiding everything from us, that aliens had already came to earth with miracle drugs but we can’t know about them. He believed everything video he saw online,  that science in textbooks were fake. thought Reptilians ruled the world, illuminati etc. if theres a conspiracy theory, he believed it.

Then it got even worse as religion played a role in it. My fathers mother died in the same time he got off dialysis and had a new kidney. My dads a very stoic person and although we knew he was sad, we don’t know how much it truly hurt him. Granted he knew she was in pain for many years so he knew it was coming and that she was in a better place.

Either way, my dad was never a religious man until around now. He got into some weird religious group ( i think its a cult or at least cultish). He began following them while he was on dialysis. They were a weird mixture of christianity and alien. From what i can understand they think god sent aliens to help us. He began having hallucinations, seeing Christ appear before him. Compulsive almost ADHD esq behavior, constantly talking about his beliefs. He literally steered every conversation towards it, EVERY one. He told me that this life isnt real, that none of us exist. He believes hes  the reincarnation of Bartholomew and that his leader of his rieligion on facebook is Jesus Christ reincarnated. He will meditate really late at night, he used to join a skype call everyday and listen to the man running the group.

Honestly this religious group in general could be a whole other post. He only believes what they say, EVERYTHING IS A CONSPIRACY. He writes daily posts on his facebook translating some bible he got from them on amazon. He has crystals and little jewels around the house, even under his pillow. He sees angels in the clouds ( he used to stop his car abruptly when he saw them)

He’s driven all his friends and family away. Although in the past year he’s shown improvement ( my mother thinks it is at least, I disagree)  he no longer talks about it to us, although if you try to have a real conversation with him it will at some point devolve back. He seems normal, no more hallucinations and the crazy mania stuff. He still is deep within this cult, its like the only thing he gets enjoyment out of ( besides being with us, specifically my mother). He seems almost like he was before except he seems more unhappy and I KNOW it’s because of this cult which ai know got him in due to some mental illness.

As you can see, its bad and im tired of letting it go on. My family has basically given up on him. My mom and brother don’t play along when he starts ranting about crazy stuff but they don’t him. My mom has begin saying its just a religion and that she can’t attack religious beliefs ( which is some bullshit denial). As for my relationship with him is strained at best. We used to fight, a lot. Over regular teenager stuff and then later his mania stuff. Ive always been against all of it, I’ve tried to have mini interventions with him. Ive shown him the hypocrisies and pyramid scheme of his cult, ive told him I don’t know him. Ive pleaded in tears for him to get help but my dad has always been stubborn. I know its hit him however because he has become very upset after our arguments when he sees me in tears.


I just need an extra judgment on what to do because im lost. If i had a better understanding of what im necessarily dealing with “disorder wise” or just general guidelines for helping someone get help, id be so grateful.

I have been in a mental health team’s care for about 3 years, and I have not had a proper diagnosis in anyway. They off-handedly mention possible things but they don’t say exactly what is happening, in their opinion. 

I have no papers mentioning diagnosis either, from all 3 years I have been in the care of the team. 

For reference, they mention that I have:

  A psychotic illness (the team members have said schizophrenia around me as well, but I asked the treating psychiatrist about that and he said “schizophrenia is interchangeable with “psychotic illness”” 

  Major depression

But when I press for a more concise answer they seem to become very hesitant to give me it, other than “you have major depression” I only recently learned about the psychotic illness part 2 months ago (when I asked about it they said from the start of care, that I showed signs of a psychotic illness, I most likely had very poor insight, but still...), and I have been in their care for 3 years.

50,"Hey all,

I’ve been dealing with constant, 24/7 depersonalization and disassociation since I was about 16 or 17 (I’m 20 now). It’s gotten to the point where it’s normal to me, I’ve gotten a lot better at dealing with it and making peace with the condition. I understand that disassociation and depersonalization can stem from childhood trauma, and I have my fair share, but I don’t understand why it began so long after the actual traumatic events occurred (when I was 5 to 7 years old).

What confuses me even more is that I’m not at all a depressed or pessimistic person. I actually have a really great outlook on life most of the time: I’m in the military, I’m going to college, I have an amazing girlfriend, I’m making good money, and I’m in the best shape of my life.

A little background on myself, i am a 30 year old male, single, never married or had children. my parents filed for divorce when i was 9 and are/were both addicts, my mother still being one and my father a recovered alcoholic. my father had a very traumatic childhood and i do not know much about my mothers. i have no health coverage other than state provided, last time i tried to get help i was not taken seriously and judged as a drug user who didn't get enough sleep. i am pretty healthy, do not drink but do smoke marijuana. i do adderall any chance i can get my hands on it but do not have a taste for harder things. i really apologize if this is long but i promise this is no self diagnosis and i do know myself pretty well, also i am not religious as i find it makes me even more crazy but i am spiritual or open to the idea of some creator.

my childhood was good, we were not well of or rich but both my parents worked. my father wasn't very abusive at all til much later but my mother always seemed very cold, halfhearted, violent, and indifferent. one of my earliest memories was being punched in the nose by my mother for not being able to figure out a math problem when i was around 5 or 6. my father was always my hero and in some ways still is. he only ever struck me when i did something i shouldn't have..

my childhood was always weird, kids seemed to single me out or pick on me for nothing, i have always been shy, quiet, introverted and preferred solitude. i am very creative from what i'm told by everyone but described as ""weird"" and people who have known me for years always misinterpret what i say. i excel most at music, art, skateboarding, reading &amp; i seem to be able to figure out something if i really think about and deconstruct it. not a jack of all trade but i guess i'm talented, i only say i guess because my life has been plagued by an overwhelming sense of doubt, shame, guilt, fear, and severe lack of self confidence. i do not have very many close friends and i have great trouble making new friends and in most relationships i have be it romantic or friendly. every woman i have ever been with has left, i never initiate the breaking up.

i have only held two jobs in my life and i got my first job when i was 28 at a restaurant.  i never made any lasting friendships there and if anything i found dealing with people very difficult. people there would ask me why i seemed so smart but worked there and also the same goes for my other job at a smaller dining establishment. 

after my parents divorced my father had a fling with what i would consider a very wealthy lady who was just using him to pass the time while he real man was doing prison time. after she kicked us out (age 9-10) we moved back to my small town (which is full of very hostile and close-minded people) my father began drinking heavily and that's where he became very abusive. i was beat multiple times over minor things ( i wasn't a very troublesome child) and not just with a belt, i had my head slammed into the ground, shoes thrown at me, dead legs, very violent mental threats, shotguns pulled out on me, my father threatening to kill himself and a lot of other things i always thought were normal for some reason. my mother turned into a total meth head after they split and i very seldom would go visit her. my father would also always accuse me of being an ingrate and always preached to me about various things philosophically. my father was what i would call a ""jeckyl and hyde"" type of drinker, he is the best person i know but when drunk there is this change in him. 

&amp;#x200B;

some of the things i have wrote down after a few hours are: ( lol, just a few)

fear of being judged harshly, constant worry about everything, fear or worry of upsetting people or if they are in a bad mood, what they think of me, being highly self critical, hard time focusing or getting ""psyched"" to do anything even the things i love deeply, feelings of uselessness, intrusive negative thoughts, most people seem to upset me easily or i upset them, socially awkward, autistic thinking (day dreaming - subjective thinking)  

gets bored easily, trouble trying to fit in or be a regular member of society (also no desire to) feeling of impending death or doom, have always felt like someone was watching me (god some sort of grand paternal deity)  i require validation for nearly everything i do or make,  i only see the bad in what i do and seldom the good, loud noises irritate me to the point of outbreak, i can feel like everything (not just when i take mushrooms) it's always been that way, i have very particular taste and my senses seem to be operating on overdrive, very sensitive hearing, certain fabrics drive me insane

&amp;#x200B;

i inject negativity into every interaction or just about, i assume the worst, i am highly suspicious of authority, very jealousy/controlling in past relationships, i isolate myself frequently and prefer it that way, i look for any slight or attack against me and make decisions based off of that (if i assume a person hates me i just start hating them first)

even if a person is truly honest and denies whatever i have accused or suspect them of, i feel things extreme apprehensiveness to believe them. i am not a team player and prefer to work alone quietly undisturbed, i hold grudges for extended periods of time over anything i interpret as a slight against me or attack of my character.

&amp;#x200B;

obsessive over-thinking, thinking myself out of doing anything even stuff like going to the market or the corner store. i think people are always out to keep me down or see me fail and i also thinking they are going to laugh at or make fun of me. i am always scanning where ever i happen to be for clues be it to validate my beliefs or to prepare for potential danger. very scared to open up or be vulnerable to other in fear of them using it against me or to make fun of me.

&amp;#x200B;

i again apologize for this but i at least needed to get this better sorted for when i can get actual help but i need to know as i have ever only been diagnosed with adhd and my old doctor said i was potentially ""gifted"" which is a nice way of saying i am on some sort of spectrum i would guess. 

&amp;#x200B;

i know this all seems like someone on web md who thinks they are dying from ass cancer but i really can assure you this is all after months of intensive introspective thinking. i need advice on what this sounds like and what to do in terms of getting the proper help, i consider myself functioning at the least but i am literally drowning and i find it so hard to stay positive given most of my life has been controlled by doubt.  i do not want an easy way out of life, i enjoy working hard very much but anything that requires me to speak with people ruins my focus and i get moody after about 3 hours of working at any job like that. again, i do not abuse drugs and the drugs i do take i try to use in a helpful way if that sounds ridiculous but i value my body and like feeling healthy. it's my mind that has the issue, i have to use stimulants or drink a shit load of redline xtreme in combination with small doses of mushrooms and dabs. i use them to change my perspective and manage emotions, never do i use to escape or just to be high. i use skateboarding and playing guitar among other things to truly escape and when i am skateboarding or creating i feel the best ever

&amp;#x200B;

any way i'll be amazed if any one reads this, i also posted this elsewhere so sorry for the double post but if anything i do feel much better after having wrote this, thank you! 

&amp;#x200B;

p.s. this is all not an actual voice in my mind but more like my thoughts, it's always there but i do not feel this way as in all these issues and paranoia are not from where i operate but rather it is a huge part of who i am, like a shadow figure pulling the strings and since i am so doubtful i usually just do what ever it says.",26Jun2019,2
54,"For as long as I can remember I've always had trouble crying. I get depressed pretty frequently but I'm just... unable to really release it. I cried a lot when I had to put my dog down, and I've cried a couple times since, although I don't really know what provoked it. But even if I'm borderline suicidal I just can't bring myself to cry. Instead I just shut down and withdraw. It doesn’t help that I’m horrible at describing how I feel, or what’s bothering me, so I can’t effectively communicate and I have to just dwell on how I feel. 

I’d give anything to just have a good cry, really let out all this tension and despair I’m holding onto, but I can’t make myself. I hate it so much.",26Jun2019,1
55,"I am 17 and live in the San Gabriel Valley, for some reason I ALWAYS feel paranoid at night. Because of this, falling asleep is a difficult task for me. Every time I hear a noise I start freaking out. I would like some advice.",26Jun2019,3
56,"Over the past 3 years I’ve been struggling with my mental health. It was a problem before, but it’s only gotten worse lately.
I can almost feel it like... rotting? Does that make sense? It’s getting really bad and I am worried because there’s nobody to ask for help. I have to help myself but it’s becoming harder and harder.
Every day it feels like I am swimming in frozen water and my arms are getting tired and my body hurts and I just want to stop and sink so the pain would go away. I don’t want to swim anymore, I’m going nowhere, there’s no land in sight, no warmth. I’m afraid that I might stop and that would be the end.
My anxiety has gotten really bad, I have random panic attack when I think about studying and exams, my depression is acting out as well, I get these sudden urges to jump in front of a car, to jump over a bridge or to swallow a fistful of pills and they come out of nowhere. Yesterday I was minding my business and I started feeling this pain in my chest that I feel before an anxiety attack, but it wasn’t anxiety, I was looking into the street at the card fleeing by and I wanted to walk in the middle of it so badly. It ended up with me bursting into tears and shaking really badly. 
These scare me. Cause it’s getting harder and harder to realize I shouldn’t do that. Why shouldn’t I just jump in front of a car?
Also, my mood swings are getting more frequent. One second I feel like the most confident, smart,beautiful and successful person, I want to go out and have fun and do crazy stuff and the next I feel so worthless, hopeless and useless it’s physically painful.
I’m also angry all the time. The kind of anger that makes you red in the face and shake. It’s more like rage, not anger. 
My memory went to shit as well. I barely remeber stuff like paying bills or buying stuff. I have to write down things like “lock the door” or “feed the cat” and shit like that. 
What can I do? I don’t know how to deal with this and there’s nobody to ask for help. I asked my mother once, I would rather die than ask again. Can’t afford a shrink and if I did went to one I can already hear my mother complain about how much I cost and how much of a burden I am.",26Jun2019,3
57,"I've bottled up a lot of stuff over the past couple of years. I finally decided that I needed to talk some stuff over and was completely shot down. I was told not to talk because it would have consequences. She literally said no - consequences, without even knowing what I wanted to talk about. The one thing that would help, talking, was blocked, is that normal? 

A few years back I spent time in hospital. I didn't want that to ever happen again so kept everything to myself and stopped talking. Out of fear of consequences. Then when I get to the point I need to talk I can't because consequences. Friends have always said ""nothing will come from just talking"" but here we are, fears confirmed. These things have been building up and bubbling and I don't know what to do. It took a lot to ask for help and want to open up.

Is this normal? Does this make sense?",26Jun2019,1
58," Hi, so I have never been scared od pregnancy , I had regular Protected sex , but now I just can't. I have pregnancy scares every fucking day and I am scared to even touch my boyfriend's dick. I have panic attacks few times a day, at morning it is the worst. The only thing I do is counting my days ,when my period is due to. This month I have been waiting from day 22, now I have 8 more left and I can't take it anymore. Two days ago I decided to give my boyfriend bj. I was feeling so brave. But that wouldnt be me if i wasnt overthinking that again. And I realized that I did such a huge mistake. Two or three hours later when I was already at home , I got little bit in mood and used my saliva to masturbate. After a few minutes I realized what I just did. He came inside of my mouth and I used my saliva couple hours later. I got such a huge panic attack. What if there was still living sperm in my mouth? Could it impregnante me? I swallowed it, drank after coke- thats the only thing that keep my hopes up- that there was nothing left. I just can't take this anymore. I am so worried about this mistake I did. I dont have sex with my boyfriend just because of my paranoia and when I decide to do something brave like this, I fucked up. This was such a huge mistake. Now I am lying in bed , crying that I am stupid because I did that and waiting to pass this 8 fucking days and hope to survive. I hope my period ll come after this incident.",26Jun2019,0

61,"I have recently run out of sleeping medicine, only to find myself realizing tonight that it may be a crutch for being unable to quiet my brain, particularly from having imaginary conversations with people.

Example - my Girlfriends Mother called me a liar over something earlier, and consequently I have spent the last four hours having complete and full conversations over and over saying the same things repeatedly. 

For the longest time I have chalked it up to anxiety manifested in preparing for confrontation with people, but I cannot physically stop it to sleep without medication. 

It is also odd that when these conversations lull, the silence is replaced by repeating the same few lines from verses in songs I’ve recently listened to. Tonight it is Wish by Alien Ant Farm.

62,"I'm 35F and in the process of finishing my PhD, but I seem to be losing my memory and it's getting worse pretty consistently. I don't remember books/articles I read, I forget words (even simple ones) when writing, and my concentration spans are non-existent. I don't know what's going on, I don't know if I should go for tests - and if so, what tests to even ask for. And I'm worried that this is affecting my ability to work on my PhD, which I was hoping to finish in the next 6 months. Also, my father had stomach cancer and it seems to have moved into his bones, and he keeps saying that he wants to see me receive my PhD before he dies... I don't know what to do!

Other info: I don't drink or smoke, I am a trail runner so physically very active. Recently started giving up dairy and gluten for sinus issues, don't eat red meat. I've been on anti-anxiety meds for about 3 years, but this issue started before then. In other words, I am by all accounts pretty healthy, so I don't know what could be causing the memory issues.

63,"So about 4 years ago, I coached gymnastics. I absolutely loved coaching, There was nothing in this world I loved more, The reason I stopped coaching is because I got fired. There was a little girl in my class that would come in all the time with bruises, I thought nothing of it at first, because she’s a kid, and athletic kid. Kids get bruises. But then she came in with a black eye and told me that her mom hit her. I was barely 18 at the time, and I had no clue what to do. I went to my boss, bawling. She told me that she would handle it. 

A week later, the child was pulled from my class, and I was called into the gym office, they were firing me, apparently, my boss was friends with this mom and “she would never do that”

Ever since then, I’ve had nightmares about children being abused and I’ve been helpless to the situation. It got better after a while, but I’ve recently gotten back into coaching. I’ve barely been getting any sleep. Last night’s nightmare was about two boys, one was about 5, the other was a baby, no older than 2. Their dad was abusing them, and there was nothing I could do, the older son died and something was happening with the younger boy. I don’t remember what, that’s when I woke up. 

What should I do? I need sleep. 

tl:dr/ there was a child abuse situation that I couldn’t do anything about, I got fired from coaching gymnastics. Now I’m coaching again and I can’t sleep because of it.",26Jun2019,1
64,"Hello, i’ve been dealing with anxiety for a long time, i’ve never seen a therapist or gotten help. As a child when my dad would yell at me i’d kinda vanish, I couldn’t think, i’d feel light headed, i’d have difficulties breathing and i’d feel nauseous. My anxiety got to a peak when i was so worried about failing my family and about not getting any scholarships i’d tried to kill myself and failed. My family never treated me the same, my siblings all act differently now, i’m ignored, talked down to, and not respect by all of them short of my mother and my little sister who was too young to understand and is lesbian so she also risks being ostracized as I have. I went off to college and tried to forget my past but I can’t run away from my problems, especially with my very difficult relationship with my father who views me as a selfish, entitled, attention hog who will do anything to get out of work, including suicide. He says he loves me and stuff, and does nice things, helps me out in emergencies but he’ll still bad talk my health behind my back and make an example of me to my siblings which only further strained my relationship with them. My youngest brother views me as weak and insecure, a push over to be bullied and overcome. My middle brother rarely talks to me, and largely ignores me unless it’s dnd related (it’s really the only thing we have to talk about.) I’ve come to realize that what he’s done isn’t forgivable, just as much as I cannot forgive myself. i have a lot of trouble at times finding positive qualities about myself, often i think of myself as evil, manipulative, weak, ruthless, immoral, ugly, sickly, frail, awkward, cowardly, violent, and disgusting. it’s a wonder I’ve managed to find a fiancé, let alone a first date. She helps remind me of positive things about me, i try to really be strong and not co-dependent on her when it comes to these things, i tell myself i have to be a strong fighting man, a stereotypical image of western masculinity but it’s really hard. Especially when dealing with my family, who gives me a lot of anxiety, i couldn’t face them and tell them off, i was raised in a very traditional house hold, where loyalty to the family is everything. My father loves to tell the story of how my grandfather died for the family business, and how he misses him and how honorable it was. but honestly, i just wish i could get some breathing room from all these people, sometimes even my fiancé who, grew up in a small house and doesn’t understand “alone time”.  I have so much anxiety about things recently though, which got me to post here, that i’m having dark thoughts again, stuff i had believed i had pushed back and overcome, but now the sum of my financial debts from the deterioration of my physical health has made me wonder if i should just die and end the money sink that is my life. All i’m doing is just draining away people’s money with no hope of being able to pay it back. I’ll be in collage debt till i’m 80, i might as well die instead of debt slaving for the rest of my life and let my fiance find someone better suited to take care of her. She says she only loves me and wouldn’t want anyone else but, i feel like anyone else would be better for her. I’m just so worthless, I cannot stand for long, my legs are ruined from being struck by a car, I cannot breath as easily, and I’ve realized my dream of being an author is probably pointless, all my writing is so shitty, even this gross list-stream of consciousness garbage I’m writing. i’m not a great scientist, a great writer, or a great anything. I’m a worthless deranged lune-y... and i have no clue how to get better or make it better. I’m broke dick, I gotta go home to visit my family to see my little sister who just got out of the ICU, and I cannot handle dealing with my father! Who’s going to poke and prod as my mental health with accusations and his weird “self in betterment” ideas treating me like i’m simply unmotivated, lazy, or theres a singular environment cause for my affliction. and to top it all off i have to fill out paper work with him and i’m DREADING THAT SO MUCH! paperwork always gives me anxiety.

66,"*POSSIBLE TRIGGER WARNING*
disclaimer: i don’t think anyone is responsible for my mental health, I know it’s up to me to sort it out.

for the past year i’ve been in a pretty bad mental state, being with my family as of recently has been nice and helped me a lot. Then reality set in that i’m leaving again soon, and it kind of kicked me into a spiral.

I’m starting to dissociate and feel really numb and isolated, so I started rehashing everything i’ve surprised for the past 6 months at least. (I say 6 months because I tried to outwardly convince myself and others that I am okay.) I’ve done some pretty impulsive stuff regarding my appearance and just some other stuff here and there. I’m pretty sure i relapsed with some pretty dark coping mechanisms about a month ago but i was too drunk to remember it.

The point of me saying all of this is during all of this time I feel like my S.O. (who prides themselves on being very observant) hasn’t batted an eye. I feel like they don’t see it, and i feel like my body this whole time has been screaming at me to listen while i was trying to suppress everything. However, with such blatant changes, obvious mood swings, and some abnormal behavior- that i see now when i look back-i would think that someone as observant as my S.O.  would have noticed? especially since we started living together about 2 months or so ago?

For some context, they do know about my desperation, in the distant past (we’ve been together for 3+ years) i’ve told them everything about some of my episodes i’ve had. So they know about it. I just can’t tell if this is a matter of me just being in a really bad place emotionally right now and i need someone to blame, or if it’s worth being upset over?

Hopefully this makes sense. If you’ve even read all of that- thank you.",26Jun2019,1
67,"As a young man, i spent my fairshare of days in an therapists office. In the the 4 years i was actively seeing one, i learned alot about how Depression and Anxiety influence your actions down to your daily routine. Hygiene was a big one. Usually on my worst weeks, i could bring myself to shower every 3-4 days and every other day on my better ones. I felt disgusting but i always sucked it up and wallowed in my own filth. Ever since i moved in with my gf, i had a point of reference that was even more unclean than myself. She has a brother thats a Sophomore in highschool and hes a great kid. He's a little on the nerdy side and loves to play on his PC egregious amounts. He however, has a cleanliness problem. Ever since he was young, he never showered and reaked of feces. The kids at school would tell the teachers because it was unbearable most of the time. It became such a regualr problem, that the Principle would see him everyday and do a smell check to make sure his odor wouldn't disrupt class. years later, the problem persist and is just as bad as ever. he has a weird relationship with his butt and never wipes is what ive learned from the family. We discovered it because he tends to forget to flush and after he leaves , theres a distinct lack of TP and he his laundry is always caked in dookey.it's sad because deep down he's a cool person, but its hard to get to see that side when his smell repels people. Its particularly pungent, when combined with his once a week shower and his twice a week outfit change. a full 7 days of doodoo that accumulates and his natural B.O. are on levels of uncharted repulsive sometimes. When confronted and asked about it, he lashes out aggressively, and cries. I understand it can be alot for a kid, especially with all of the trauma and issues that have always surrounded the topic but i can't understand why this is happening to him.

I tend break-down and over analyze everything I see &amp; hear. I suppose I’d prefer to appreciate what’s going in life more.. without breaking it down into shreds. it’s bothering my mental health and energy levels. All the energy’s going towards trivial, useless, mainstream CRAP. I’m sick of it. Addictive behavioral patterns are. b*tch. 

The most painful part is that I come off as aloof and distant. It’s not right that I don’t give time to the important aspects in life like spending time with my immediate family. I’ll catch myself paying attention to useless shit throughout the day.

There's so much more to it than that though, I feel everything closing in and crushing me down. Life doesn't feel livable anymore. I'll be spending today alone, and with everything that's happened and has been going on, I don't think I can cope with these thoughts anymore. They're drilling into my head, it feels like I can't escape them. There's so many ways today can end and I'm scared my day will end early. I keep eyeing the ibuprofen.

70,"I'll preface all of this with a warning, I'm going to rant, I need to vent and wouldn't mind a little input to be honest. I'm 23 and kind of just typing as it comes. Apologies in advance. 

I feel like I'm only weeks, maybe even days away from ending my life. (Or at least running from it.) I want it. I've wanted it for so long and no one gets why, no one understands. Except maybe you r/mentalhealth. 

Since around 11 I've had the thought in my head that nothing matters. I realised that I'd never be anything special. I'm nothing more than the man stood next to me, or the millions who have lived and died before me. There's nothing I can do that can change this planet or any of your lives. Nothing that could leave a positive lasting impact. So why am I here? What is my point? 

I don't enjoy living or anything life has to offer. I don't enjoy socialising or spending time with family, I just tend to spend half of the time being ignored anyway because I'm 'weird'. Meeting nee people was scary but didn't work, I cannot find a single person I click with, someone that just gets me, male or female, no one is interested. Gaming has fizzled and died out for me and reddit is finally getting boring. Everything has gotten boring. 

I'll never have the future I wanted as a child. Like most kids I used to dream about a nice car, a nice house, a couple of kids and a wife. I wanted the nuclear family, a career, stability and love. I can't afford driving lessons and have been sesrching for a new job for over a year. I feel trapped financially and to top it off I've racked up debts because woo. I don't seem to have a sex drive or any sexual interest in anyone anymore. Kind of feels like all the above is impossible. Now the only thing I want is to feel something. 

As nothing matters and more importantly I as an individual don't matter, I don't see my time of death being all that important. Now or in 50 years, the result is the same, my corpse. 
I'm serious when I'm typing this but why on earth am I expected to ""pull up my boot straps"" and get on with it? Why am I, the one that feels like their heart and soul are being torn out daily, called selfish when I don't want to suffer anymore? 


It's bullshit.

71,"I think I have some kind of social anxiety.. I was always sensible with nonverbal human interaction, but at the moment I'm interpreting so much into it, I'm afraid of embarass myself through behaving oversensible/awkward when going into social interaction and it turns into an awfully reliable self-fulfilling prophecy. Strangers who dont have these symptoms find it hard to understand and are judging me for behaving off or immature in their eyes. Ironically this is exactly what I'm afraid of, and it's a bit harsh because people seem to feel like understanding me instantly (they have a smirking and superior look then) but they dont see it feels more like a suffering and an incompetence to feel things correctly. Im under stress and relaxed people treat me like I am making mistakes, which is totally understandable but still harsh from my perspective.

72,"Okay, so... 

I'm diagnosed with social phobia, which basically means any and every social interaction causes me anxiety. My psychiatrist prescribed me 10mg of Prozac daily and 0.25 Xanax on occasions in which I work myself into a crisis - which, say, happens from 3 to 4 times a month, nothing too serious.

I've read a lot of people saying that Prozac causes loss of apetite, drowsiness, alongside other things - but what's bugging me is that, I've been eating like NEVER before. I'm a bit of a picky eater, but since I started on the medication there's rarely a time in which I don't feel like eating - and my stomach is always feeling empty, which is causing me a bit of a nuisance.

My psychiatrist has scheduled me to go back there after 40 days on the medication, so far it's been 5 days. 

Has anyone experienced this side effect? Can you tell me if it's normal and if it will go away? If you can provide me with a tip or two to tone down the hunger, I'd be very thankful!",26Jun2019,1
73,"Throwaway account. 
So for a couple of years I've been noticing myself getting really upset about insignificant things. Initially I thought it was because my partner at the time wasn't the right person for me, however, after dating somebody else these mood swings have only decreased in frequency. 
Things like not getting a text back or feeling like I have annoyed the other person make my mind go to all sorts of places and then I just cry a lot. Other time if I'm reminiscing of good times I end up panicking and crying. 
Basically, I think my emotions are all over the place.
The weirdest thing is that after all the crying, I don't really remember why I was crying in the first place. I even started writing down these episodes in order to understand why I'm crying. 
If I'm alone when this happens, I get a feeling of emptiness after all the tears. 
Has anyone else ever experienced this? I don't want to ruin my relationship.",26Jun2019,1

He could've lived for so much longer. Later, I went to the house of a girl i really care about and I hung out with her for a while, but then she told me that her mom was getting married and she was going to move before the next school year.

75,"I was diagnosed with Bi-Polar a little over a year ago(diagnosed at 17). Ive been taking meds since then. The meds I take is called Abilify and a big side effect of these meds is having a crazy appetite. So over the course of a year I went from pretty fit and athletic to losing everything I worked for when it came to fitness. I was unhappy and fit now I'm unhappy(in a different way) and not fit.

When I was fit it was my bipolar that got in the way and made me not happy with myself. Now, the meds do work for the most part. Almost completely stopped my outbursts that affected the relationships with my family, gf, and friends. And mostly stabilized my mood. Now that is mostly coped with(not gone, itll never go away I've came to terms with it). But now my crazy appetite and huge lack of motivation for working out is getting in the way. These meds helped with one problem and then caused a completely new one. 

Well, what I'm asking for is how do I change this. It's really starting to affect me to the point where I stop taking my meds(and if you could guess that never goes well).

New meds?
I've looked into it a lot of these kinds of meds have this same side effect....

New way of rekindling my motivation?
I've tried everything in could think of...

New way to cope with my Bi-Polar?
I have no clue on what else could help. Therapy is too awkward for me and I cant spill how I feel to some stranger...

I finally got into a therapist/psychiatrist(starting in 3 weeks), but I've been seeing a different psychiatrist at a different practice (an hour weat for me) for 3 months (4 sessions).

In every one of those 4 sessions, I had to go over the symptoms he diagnosed me with. He wrote it down each time and he still questions me like I just brought it up. never reviews his notes unless I reference something from another session.

He doesn't listen to all my concerns. Like I would start to tell him how I feel I have body dysmorphia, he would ask me why I feel that way, then move onto something else after I answer.

84,"Hi all,

I need some advice on coping mechanisms for my triglomania. I've had it for a while and only been diagnosed by a doctor pretty recently. Haven't tried therapy yet as I think it should probably be a last resort, so Reddit it is. If you don't know what triglomania is (sorry if I'm spelling it wrong) it's absent-minded pulling at the hair, in my case eyebrow and eyelashes. It's absent-minded, but it flared up a bit around periods where I feel stressed and that can cause some ingrowth and it takes a while to grow back. I rarely have good periods, and it's badly impacted my eyebrows. Please, can anyone help me with some tips to stop this absent-minded pulling? It will really help as I need to stop, because if I keep going I may not have the chance to regrow my hair. 
Thanks a lot",26Jun2019,1
85,"I am 16/M. About a year ago, i went for an evaluation for my OCD, i was diagnosed and put into therapy once again. 

Im gonna keep this as a short tl;dr because i don’t want to prolong talking about this because it triggers bad memories.

My best friend died last january, my other friend attempted suicide last july.

This threw my life in a loop, and over-time i got worse and worse, every-time a friend had an issue or concern even if mild i would freak out because I was afraid they would attempt suicide. Im extra careful around my loved ones, i can’t bare losing them. 

I get nightmares sometimes of friends and loved committing suicide. I get intrusive thoughts about one day walking in and seeing my mother dead or cat or sister (i think this one falls under OCD, but im saying it anyway)

Every-time death is mentioned among people im taken back to remembering how bad i was last January. 

It got to the point where yesterday morning i woke up, checked my phone, and found out one of my favorite streamers and people of all time passed, who helped me get through alot of this bad stuff. I tried to calm myself down but then the flashbacks started to pour in and i couldnt stop thinking about my friend and my other friend who only attempted it, i freaked out crying saying it couldn’t get out of my head.

I talked with some friends, and one of them said I may have PTSD. Ive been avoiding that label for months, i hate self diagnosis and i dont want to put myself into a group that i may not belong to. So every time someone mentioned it i doubted it. She then told me its not just War or other struggles, and said I should keep that in mind.

So i want to get an evaluation concerning this, how would I go about it?",26Jun2019,1

93,"Was hoping someone might be able to help w issues I've been having. 

For background I've been dealing with severe depression and social anxiety for the past decade.

I notice more and more that I feel like I struggle to hold complex trains of thought, such as being analytical or coming up with ideas. I struggle to retain information, I haven't read a book in years bc the words blur together and become hard to comprehend. I have a lot of memory problems and concentration problems. It feels as though I'm on autopilot, I don't think anything through extensively, just kinda do everything through muscle memory. 
My brain feels like static that's too loud. I feel more like I'm observing rather than actually living. I just feel... blank, or muted. 

In my job I'm surrounded by people who are very intelligent and multiskilled, I feel very inadequate around them as I'm kinda just good at the one thing I do. I work in the arts though, so being multiskilled is extremely beneficial for broadening career prospects, and I do want to learn things! But with the current state of my brain it just feels like an enormous mental hurdle. 

I'm not entirely sure what's wrong with me, its just been getting worse and worse over the years. I went to a psychiatrist to ask about ADHD (as I have many of the inattentive symptoms) but he doesn't think it's that. I don't know if this is entirely just severe depression fucking up my brain for 10 years, or if there's something else.

95,"In the past 6 months or so, I’ve noticed that when a negative past experience pops into my head (something cringy that I did, usually pops up when I’m laying in bed, which I know everyone has experienced)... my body shakes. Just one or two little jolts and then the thought goes away. I didn’t really think a lot of it.

More recently, I fucked up something major. I don’t think the details of what I fucked up aren’t relevant to the nature of this post, but, let’s just say I knew I was fucking up while it was happening, after it happened, and the morning after it happened I even got into an argument with my boyfriend about how much I fucked up. For the days following (especially the day after), whenever any part of that evening popped into my head, my body started violently shaking. I would have to stop what I was doing to basically hold myself and cover my face until it stopped. I would cry. I wouldn’t say it lasted longer than 20 or 30 seconds at the maximum, but it was happening often. As time went on it didn’t happen as often, and eventually the violent shaking just turned into the one or two jolts. Of course, the only time these would happen is when any part of that night/situation pops into my head. In fact, a few of those jolts are happening as I write this post, and it’s been about 3 days after the evening happened. It’s a vivid flashback and my heads like “fuck, make this go away”.

I would say the last time the shaking happened was about a day and a half after the shit played out. I was talking to my boyfriend, (not at all about the situation, just talking about whatever) it just popped into my head half a second, my body turned on like a damn vibrator, and I was holding my head. Probably only occurred for 5-7 seconds, but he was definitely looking at me funny. 

Anyways, to the actual freaking question, has anybody experienced this??? Is this some sort of coping mechanism my brain has created to try and rid me of negative thoughts and experiences? Any input is appreciated, because I have no idea what’s going on.",26Jun2019,2

97,"We’ve all had times where we’ve been struggling and people with the best of intentions say the worst things to ‘comfort’ us. While these people genuinely think they are helping, often times and they’re hurting. To be clear, I’m not mad at them because I know often times they are just trying to help, but my hope is that this post will open peoples eyes to what is helpful and what is not.

1. The Quick Fix Solution Givers
These people think that when someone opens up about a struggle, the best way to help them is to try to fix the problem. While that might seem to be the nicest thing to do, it often times invalidates the pain the person is going through by telling them there is a ‘fix’. We see this all the time! People who are struggling with infertility are often told to just adopt. People struggling with mental health are told to exercise or think more positively. People struggling with weight loss or gain are told to eat better when they might already be eating perfectly. Telling someone that there’s a solution invalidates their struggles because why on earth should they be struggling if there’s a solution? Just because there are options or fixes doesn’t take away the pain of the struggle. And more often than not, the people struggling are already aware of these solutions and might be working towards using them. Unless someone explicitly asks for a solution, don’t throw one at them. Instead, be there for them through the process, because any pain takes time to heal, and more than anything they just need support through that process.

2. The Comparison Crew
“Well it’s not as bad as this other person”, “it could be worse”. There is nothing quite as frustrating as being told what you’re going through really isn’t that bad. 99% of the time, yes there is someone out there who has it worse, but that doesn’t mean that what that person is going through is easy! The struggle is real and valid and hard, stop minimizing it!

3. The All About Me Myself and I
You’ve decided to open up about a struggle to someone and instead of comforting you or being there for you they make it about them. They compare situations they’ve been in to yours no matter how similar or far fetched the comparison might be. They talk about how the endured, how they overcame. Sure they might think by doing so they are showing you can get through whatever it is you’re struggling with, but when people open up about something, it’s not so you can talk about your struggles/wins. It’s so they can find a support system. So my tip if you fall into this group: close your mouth, and open your heart and ears.

4. The Blamers
“I told you so”, “You got yourself into this mess”. Yeah, these people suck. Even if it is true that the person struggling got themselves into the situation they’re struggling with, they don’t need you throwing it in their face! They came to you for help and support, not condemnation and ridicule! And chances are if they are responsible for the situation, they probably are already feeling guilty and have to deal with that on top of everything else. Placing blame does not help in any way, use that energy instead to be kind and support them.

While I’m sure I missed some, hopefully this gives a better idea of what is not helpful to those who are struggling. More than anything people simply need support, just to know they have people in their corner who are cheering them on. So be kind, be supportive, and bless others lives!",26Jun2019,39

99,"Living with depression has never been easy. To those who don’t understand what depression is, or at least mine, it’s a dopamine (and/or serotonin) deficiency.

Without dopamine, you don’t want to talk to anybody. I mean you do, but you don’t feel like it or know how to. You just have nothing to say. Without dopamine, you can’t see how beautiful the things around you are. You could be at the beach on an all-expenses paid vacation, you could be visiting the Grand Canyon, you could be in Hawaii, it doesn’t matter. You’re not impressed and just can’t bring yourself to appreciate it.

Having a deficiency in dopamine while being around everybody who doesn’t have the same problem isn’t easy because they don’t understand. This is why I get myself so involved with drugs. Even if it’s just a little bit of caffeine, or heavier, more serious shit, I just want to feel *something.* To know what it’s like to think like everybody else, even if it’s just for a few minutes, means everything to me. But that’s not socially acceptable and you have to hide it all the time. It’s so hard to find somebody who understands and to just talk to people.

101,"Basically, I need new and alternative words BEFORE I go in. I don't want to be misunderstood. I'll use my own first, but I'm not sure how else to SAY what I'm feeling, and the couple of (non medical professional) people I've talked to about it didn't really seem to... get it. 

To be clear, I am not looking for any sort of diagnosis here, though if you relate to this feeling and want to share about it yourself I'd be happy to read.

The phrasing I've landed on for this feeling about my body is ""this isn't my house, I just live here"" like. As if I'm renting. I can't move out, and it's the only house I will ever have, but I also can't do anything with it. I'm inside, my stuff is there, I've got an undetermined rent agreement, but it's not MINE. Some changes I want to make are easy and I can get approved with little hassle, if I need it at all: new paint, what furniture and art I have. Other things are next to impossible. Like I know \[x\] would be GREAT and would increase property value (perception of self, or the like) but I can't because of the HOA or my landlord or because there's just not the space I thought there was, once it came down to taking the measurements.

Which. all gets a little convoluted and metaphor-y, but it's the best way I have been given to describe the way I feel.

I'm not floating through, things just don't. IDK.

105,"I've been with the same therapist for years and I really like and trust her. I'm a librarian so I'm decently good at finding credible sources of info, of all varieties, which I think tends to play a role in how she treats me.

She's allowing me to consider which type of medication I want to try next - Paxil, Zoloft, Lexapro, or Prozac.

I'm on Wellbutrin but I'm struggling with alcohol use, which puts me at risk for having a seizure so we're switching. Obviously, treating the alcohol abuse is important but in the meantime leaving me open to a fuck up isn't ideal.

I think I recall doing well on Lexapro in the past but she said it may lower libido. My husband lives/works away right now but I don't know how I feel committing some portion of my life to being on something that may lower my libido. If I have to I will, better a lower libido than dead.

Zoloft I've only used for a bit. Messed with my sleep a little, I got up one night early into taking it and knocked stuff off of my dresser.

111,"Hello you beautiful people of Reddit,
I am having flashbacks of times I embarrassed myself and of the good times I had in my ended relationship and it ruins my day whenever it happens. 
I am already seeing a doctor because I think I am suffering from a type of depression (probably bipolar) and social anxiety but I am afraid to talk to my doctor about the flashbacks and what causes them because I feel ashamed of having these flashbacks without going through a real traumatic event which usually causes this in most people. 
Maybe you know more about flashbacks, what should I do?",26Jun2019,1
112,"When I was little I would wander off and get lost a lot. I would also hide. My parents would forget about me sometimes. I was/am very quiet. I always had to hold someones hand when I would go out with my family. However I would end up trying to leave the whole time.

​

I don't wander off like that anymore. I do it more when I am alone. Now I cant focus for long periods of time and it causes me to get bored easily. I had so many problems with babysitters and teachers. I wouldn't go to bed on time and I wouldn't do my work at school. I also used to just leave class. I couldn't handle it. I would get really frustrated. I liked learning things but I didn't learn things very fast. It took me much longer to learn certain things, such as how to tell time and how to do long division and multiplication. I also could not handle high school math and had to take a lower level of it.

I had a behavior intervention plan as well. I remember I once stood on a table in art class because I was dared to. I also used to throw things like pencils, because it was fun. I also always showed up late even though I woke up on time and left on time. I didn't do my work either. I would sometimes just sit there and feel irritated. I felt really irritated when it was summer and I couldn't be outside. I did get special allowances though. Sometimes I was allowed outside when I did a certain amount of work. People got jealous of that. I hardly ever got to do it though because I didn't do enough work a lot of the time.

i feel like someone is always watching me trough my eyes. like the person is seeing whatever i’m seeing. and it’s always someone specific, like my friends, my crushes, my co-workers. 
i always thought this was something that everyone experiences but i talked to my friend about it and he said it’s not. and then i talked to more friends, it’s not a thing everyone feels. 
and i can’t live normally these past few months have been the most anxious over-worked i ever was. but at the same time i’m fine, i’m pretty happy and all, it’s just that work is very tough atm and my anxiety is at its peak. and the fact that i feel like i’m being watched all the fucking time is not ok. i can’t do normal things like take a shower, i can’t walk around the house with my pyjamas. everything always has to be perfect because someone is always watching and judging me. and i know it’s not real but i still can’t help but act as if i’m not alone.

115,"Trigger Warnings:

This is an honest examination of the stigma I piled onto myself and the harm that it did to me. It's hard to read, and **potentially triggering to someone with Borderline or other mental illnesses.** It includes:

* Mentions of suicide
* Mentions of self harm
* Discussion of stigma around BPD and of how it affected me from an emotional, and not at all logical standpoint
* Overly negative patterns of thinking

If you think any of this will hurt you, for your safety, please do not read.

I do not harbor any resentment or hate towards people who have borderline. All the hate in this is directed squarely at me, by me, and originated from a place of extreme mental illness.

\~\~\~\~\~

I'm bipolar 2, ADHD, have a sensory processing disorder, and panic disorder with agoraphobia.

I'm okay with, and have accepted all of these. My ADHD is something I've lived with all my life, same with the processing disorder. Bipolar can be managed, and people tend to recognize it as a real and valid reason for why I'm freaking out. Panic attacks are pretty well known, and people tend to understand people who have them. The stigma on all of these is there, but in the accepting area I live in, it's not so bad to live with.

Without getting into specifics, however, this absolute mess of brain connections made it look like I had something far more stigmatized; borderline.

Anxious me being anxious me, I went and read everything I could find about the disorder and I absorbed the stigma and symptoms of the disease and heavily judged myself by it. Although I've been cleared of ever having it, it's going to take a long time to recover from what I did to myself.

I felt like a ticking bomb. I haven't had angry outbursts since I was five, in fact being angry has always made me feel a little guilty and gross. But anger was a symptom. Once I was diagnosed with borderline, I felt immensely guilty for feeling slightly annoyed. Mt brain would tell me things like ""idiot, the world doesn't revolve around you. You don't have the right to be mad, you stupid control freak. Your anger only hurts people you love.""

Then there was the social stuff. I already was terrified of interacting with new people, but thinking I was borderline made me feel guilty for making a friend or going out to parties. In the whole year I had it, I made two new friends and pushed them both away by just not calling them because I didn't want the friendship to end in pain. I had convinced myself that the only reason I wanted friends was to control them. Note though, I hate being the leader of anything, and I hate people leading me. I would much rather have a equal, laid back friend group where no one is in charge, and there's no expectations.

But that logic didn't find me at the time. I felt guilty being around my mom, and my boyfriend of 2 years, and my family, and even my dogs. Every Time I saw someone I loved it hurt me, because my brain was telling me I needed to get away from them. I was a bomb, a ticking bomb that would explode, and I couldn't hurt anyone in the process.

The one good thing was that I couldn't cut anymore. Every time I so much as thought about it my brain screamed ""IDIOT ATTENTION SEEKER."" And I'd just go back to curling under the covers and not talking to anyone.

Perhaps wrongly, I looked up stories from kids with borderline parents. Without going into details, it made me seriously consider getting my tubes tied at 22. Or running away and living under a bridge until I die. In a manic episode, **when I was not in my right mind, thinking clearly, or well medicated** I was briefly set of transitioning to a boy so I would never have kids. I will absolutely refuse to put a kid through any of the stories that I read. I firmly believe that if I ever have a kid it will be so I can show them all the love I never showed myself and raise them to be better, kinder, smarter, and braver than I ever was. But if those stories were my future, then maybe I was incapable of that.

The most dangerous consequence, however, was the suicidal stuff. I fell back into the old pattern of never mentioning when I felt suicidal. I would tell people online. Anonymous people who I could never get to or hurt or control. But I wouldn't tell anyone in real life, because threatening suicide is a symptom, and implies I'm doing it for control. I would think: ""Nobody would take me seriously anyway, because I'm borderline."" So, when I was suicidal, I had to muddle through it and hope that a wayward impulse to kill myself (something I do experience on occasion) wouldn't happen while I was close to a bridge or knife. 

The diagnosis has been removed, but the guilt, pain, fear, and increased self hatred that I inflicted on myself because of it still remains.

Isn't it weird that I hate myself for hating myself?",26Jun2019,6

119,"so judging by this post, you all remember the last time I was here I wanted to kill myself.

120,"*if there's a better sub for this, please direct me*

Hi.

I have been served by a social worker for the past... maybe 8 years. The few gaps in service during these past few years saw me struggling severely to the point of homelessness. 

The agency I am with switched my worker on me back in February and it's been nothing but struggle ever since. The worker I am currently paired with makes me feel uncomfortable. She comes across as cold/distant and we have been having a lot of trouble communicating. She has not made much effort in terms of ""smoothing things over"". 

I talked with her supervisor. He basically dismissed my concerns and told me that I ought to participate in one of their group therapy programs, which I explained was inappropriate because I have tried this approach at least 2x before and it wasn't a good fit.

I spoke to the director of clinical services and expressed my feelings. I said I wanted to try another worker, or maybe some other solution. I asked questions and she said she'd get back to me. Almost 2 months later, she sent me a letter stating that my file would be closed.

I am now slated to lose funding for my apartment because I don't have the support worker. She isn't answering my texts or calls. The director of clinical services also won't return my call. 

The executive director of the office never bothered to reply to my email and it took me to tweet at this agency to get him to *finally* call back. 

This agency believes that I am not ""participating"" in services/refusing service and am therefore not entitled to support. 

The fact that I have unsecured funding for my apartment doesn't matter to them. The fact that I require a referral letter to be signed doesn't matter to them. The fact that I have been severely depressed, sleep 12 hours a day doesn't matter to them. The fact that I am in a fragile state and am definitely acting on a lot of emotion doesn't matter to them. I have yet to complete a diagnostic process because the stress of this has paralyzed me. I have put off surgery because I don't have any support to bring me home after surgery (this is something a support worker can do).  As a result, I am often bedridden due to pain. 

They are unwilling to pause the decision to close my file until at the very least, we secure my housing funds, get the referral letter signed. 

They won't refer me to another agency. 

I feel they are being really unethical and are assuming quite a bit about my current mental state. I feel they're stigmatizing me based on my perceived diagnosis, and are willingly leaving me vulnerable. 

I don't know what to do. I don't know who, if anyone can help me. I am terrified of becoming homeless again. My anxiety is at an all time high and I have been somewhat agoraphobic. Yet this agency thinks that I am just fine.

130,"Writing this i have lost my mind. I am 21 years old tomorrow, and honestly worse off in life than I was in 1998. I have developed a massive list of mental ""things"" real or not, maybe I am just a narcissist. I have a nasty inferiority complex in which I don't allow myself to do anything out of a sharp paranoid fear of failure. I was a ""problem child"". At around 12 I finally got bullied for my behavior. People always told me I was problematic, rude, loud, and out of line. It never really clicked as a kid. I was an idiot. However, social anxiety and this inferiority complex both developed heavily at this time. I also had ADHD (which I use to blame for my behavior - so I like to think). I also and no siblings to compare myself or to tell me straight up what my problems were. My parents had me at an older age, and were mentally unequipped to see what was wrong with me. I hated my life, and I pushed them away. They didn't seem to know it was my own twisted cry for help, or they had given up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Due to the fact that I was out of control, my parents put me on ADHD medicine which made me an internal zombie. Thus, stayed this way throughout my childhood. I have avoidant personality issues, and they came into play heavily in my early teen years. I was numb. Empty. Addicted to video games as a form of escapism that quelled the ADHD causing my brain to constantly bounce around. I distanced myself from my emotions, and held it together. I had no friends. They were only people that I perceived to be lower than me so I could act as obnoxious as I pleased and not be judged. 

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, I became bored. I wanted to live. Something new. Weed came about, as it was big in my area. And wow. That was a game changer. I had quit my ADHD medicine, became a stoner, and was committed to something new. THC allows me to access my feelings, unfortunately a lot of the things I had repressed. The pain. It rushed back. ""Everyone hates you"" ""You are such a fucking loser"" ran through my head. I became reclusive. I couldn't face who I was. Who I am. How could I let life fall apart? Why did I not stand up for myself and improve? Why were my relationships non existent? Why am I so disappointing? Where is my sense of self worth, happiness? 

&amp;#x200B;

Time went by and life got worse. I tried branching out in life but my self hatred and inferiority complex are so strong I held myself back from happiness under my nose. It was crippling. There came a point where I hated my life and myself so much that I couldn't handle sobriety. I got arrested multiple times for falling asleep drunk in the street, smoked as much as possible, anything to get away from myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, it's different. I want answers. I moved in January to a new city, and have zero friends or acquaintances. I am incredibly hateful, empty, lost, depressed, and paranoid. I cannot function in social environments. I am so fearful that my obvious flaws will come into play and ruin my life once more, so I do absolutely nothing so nothing will go wrong. I am a college student and I don't even have a reason to get out of bed unless its class. In fact, I am only in classes to please my parents and to have something to fill my time. I have no hope. 

Heavy psychedelic use has me highly disassociated, and it has made it very hard for me to get in touch with myself and my feelings. Only weed can get my in touch. It doesn't answer anything, I just am free to torture myself about what is wrong.  I feel so dead inside that when people say my name I remember that I am a living, breathing person. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point it might actually be easier to commit suicide. Sounds dramatic but really don't see a way out. I don't even know who I am and now I have all these problems at the same time. (severe depression and anxiety, paranoia, avoidant personality issues, anger). I have so many overlapping issues that all prevent each other from being solved. But I also don't really know. I am completely disconnected from life including myself. I have been obsessively researching, and my only thing I keep coming up with is I have no idea how to improve myself internally.

She’s not even opened my messages for a few days, but I know she’s around and alive as she’s been posting on Twitter. I know this is stupid. I need to stop panicking. But I can’t help it. Being abandoned is my biggest fear. This whole situation is making me feel physically sick. I don’t think she wants to know me anymore. I don’t think she remembers giving me her twitter username, and she doesn’t follow me, so I’m certain she’s just avoiding me, thinking she can get away with twitter because she doesn’t think I am on there.

141,"Since March, I've been ridiculously stressed. It started when my roommates left for spring break and I was all by myself in the dorm for a week. My cap on being alone is maybe five hours before it really starts to get to to me. Ended up with the flu and a nasty UTI because of all of the anxiety around it. Then, I had a pain in my side that just wouldn't quit (spoiler alert: it was stress pain). It made me stress out even more which just made the pain worse, and on and on and on.

In April, I started my major classes. This was stressful because my teacher was really tough, and I was the only freshman in the entire class. At the beginning of May, we all had to choose housing for next year, but my school screwed up and accepted more students than they had housing for, so that was a solid week and a half of pure panic (I managed to get a room, but there were literally three left when I logged in). At the end of May, it was move out time and finals week. Moving out was crazy - not stressful per say, but overwhelming.

During move out, my dad and my aunt came to help. While they were both there, they got into a massive fight, and I almost had to cancel a trip that my friends and I had planned to visit her out in Beverly Hills. But canceling would have meant that my friends wouldn't be able to get refunds on their plane tickets. I didn't even have one yet, because my dad went back on his promise to help me pay for mine.

All the while, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do for money. The job that I had had for three years closed in January, and my summer is so busy that nobody in their right mind would hire me. So I started freelancing. And got screwed into doing a huge job only for the client to not pay me for any of it.

Its been.....its been a rough few months.

Now, all of that stress has built up, and I just feel terrible all of the time. I get dizzy and lightheaded, my heart rate skyrockets, I get hot flashes and bouts of nausea, killer headaches, and I'm just flat out exhausted all of the time, no matter how much sleep I get.

I saw my GP on Monday, and after a full examination she chalked it up to stress just coming down pretty hard on me. She did give me a new prescription to try to help combat it, but it's going to be a good month before it really starts getting into my system.

Does anybody have any tips as to how I can help myself de-stress? I've gotta do something, I can't keep letting this rule over me.",26Jun2019,2

She is good 
She’s sexy she’s desired she’s gorgeous 
She is good 
She’s by herself she’s feeling it she’s loving it 
She is good 
She’s confident and she loves her skin

I got really high and I decided to take a shower. I looked in the mirror before I got in and something happened. I didn’t look at myself in disgust like I normally do. I saw this woman who was insanely beautiful and gorgeous. And she was me. I got in the shower and I danced what felt like was really sexy but in reality it probably looked really bad. I felt myself up loving every curve and dip and squish. I celebrated me. I finally felt like what it was to love myself. 
I got out of the shower and wrote a poem of sorts. While I was in the shower, I kept repeating the phrase she is good to some beat I made up in my head. She is good meant that my body was good and it was perfect. This poem is meant to be read to a beat. You can make one up like I did.",26Jun2019,276

144,"I have always been a calm person from my childhood, i never used to get angry. Even, two years ago, i was not the person I am now. I don't like myself now.  I get angry at the slightest inconvenience and i do or say something I shouldn't,to calm my anger that I regret about it later. Most of the time I break into tears and get hiccups which makes it worse. I tend to hurt myself too when I'm angry, but mostly i destroy stuff around me and regret later. Today i tore apart my book, the whole book. One day, my brother was annoying me and it was quite normal bc we were laughing but suddenly i felt some anger and hit him, and he said he saw my face changing in a minute when i hit him. I felt so bad that day, i cried whole night because hurting myself is still okay but i cannot think of hurting someone else. It is really not okay because when I get angry my brain stops working and when I think about it later, it hurts.  Because i was never like this. The last thing i would want to become is the person I am right now. I really try not be angry but doesn't work. I want to be normal again. I want to like myself again.",26Jun2019,1

146,"Okay, I want to get some advice about my best friend. 
We went swimming today, and they usually wear swim shorts. When they changed into their swim wear in the same room as me, which is already unusual, I saw several, parallel red cuts right at the very top of their thigh for the first time. When I asked them about it later, they didn‘t deny that they were self harm scars. They told me it happened around the time they were 12. 7 years have passed since then. Now, they didn‘t wanna talk about it anymore after that so I let it be. If for some reason they didn‘t feel like they could tell me until now, then it‘s not my place to pressure them any further. 

What I‘m concerned about is the redness of them. Is is possible they could still be this red after so long? I‘m afraid that they lied to me and it‘s a recent thing after all. If it turns out they did, should I talk to them about it and how?

I‘ve known them since kindergarten and it really hurt to find out about it this way, since I thought we shared everything and were basically family. It‘s just baffling to me how I never noticed anything, and I don‘t even wanna now what kind of trauma they could have went through. I feel like it‘s my responsibility as their best friend to help them through everything. General advice? 

Thanks..",26Jun2019,2
147,"Hi y'all. I know self diagnosing isn't good, but I'm having a really hard time just getting a regular doctor nevertheless a therapist. I think I have a slight phobia of hospitals and have a lot of anxiety around making phone calls, so setting up an appointment is hard. Neither my parents nor I had health insurance for a chunk of my teenage and early adult life, so I never went to the doctor unless it was an absolute emergency, so you can imagine how going to a doctor for being sad was looked at. Also throughout my entire academic life teachers have told my parents I have signs of ADHD, and my parents confirmed I did but I never was officially diagnosed or put on medication because my parents didn't believe in medicating children for ""being kids"". But now as an adult I'm resentful I've never gotten looked at because I've suffered academically and socially for it my whole life, and now I also struggle with depression. I have Medicaid now, and I need to see both a physical doc and a therapist but their system is so confusing and overwhelming and it's especially hard to do this when I'm in a depressive episode. Any words of advice/ encouragement would be appreciated even if it's just ""I struggle with this too"". Really going through it right now.",26Jun2019,1

149,"I find it amazing how our childhood experiences with our parents do so much more than help us learn basic skills, manners, and other rules of society. I had an extremely abusive mother growing up. I got physical and verbal abuse on a very regular basis, but there was considerable psychological abuse as well. As an adult in my 40's I am still finding new ways my mother messed up my head through deception &amp; manipulation. My mother dished out this kind of abuse on many levels; she was a master at it. It wasn't just directly telling me how bad a child I was, but it often appeared passive aggressively or as constant, but subtle, hints and actions that twisted me all up inside. 

She would become physically abusive, but before and afterwards would say and do things that were essentially victim blaming. I was the reason why I got beaten. I deserved it because I was a bad kid or could not see that some small &amp; mundane thing was such a huge problem for her. She would often say that she only beat it because she loved me so much and this is the only way I will learn to be a better kid. She would make me feel that I should be so ashamed of this abuse that I could never let anyone know how bad of a person I apparently was. The marks she left would be hidden under my shirt or shorts, but I was told I had to make sure nobody ever saw them. If people saw them, they would know I was such a bad person and nobody would like me and want to be my friend. Her abuse was my shame. She regularly told me that if people were to find out about the bruises or her hitting me, she would tell me her beatings would be get much worse from then on. It would be my fault for letting other find out. She was so good at hiding it and twisting my perception, that even my father had no idea what was going on all throughout my entire childhood. He suspected that something was not quite right, but couldn't quite put a finger on it. My mother taught me to hide it from him and everyone else as expertly as she was at dishing it out. I was taught to lie to my own father. 

Her manipulation was not just tied to the physical abuse. It had many tendrils that dug into my psyche and twisted how I would act &amp; feel, as well as how I perceived other people. Yes, I was getting beat because 'she loved me so much', but it was much more than that. Often, She would tell me ""I told neighbor so-and-so how good you did on that test"" or other similar things like that. She would regularly leave out any direct praise from herself when I did something good. I didn't even realize that she wasn't actually praising me, or the effect it would have on me. When genuine praise was given it was extremely rare. This was done so I would crave any attention I could get from her. I would yearn for compliments, validation, acceptance, and any kind of positive feeling I could get from her. I strived so much to be a good kid that I accepted any physical punishment, almost eagerly. I feared it because it hurt so badly, but being beaten meant I was loved. Being beaten meant I still had a long way to go to be a good kid but it was so that I could learn to be a better son. It meant my mother loved me because she was actually giving me attention and trying to help me.

One particular experience (of many) is very strong in my memory. My father was not home the night this happened. As a child, not sure how old I was, maybe 5 or 6, in the early years of elementary school. I don't know what I did that was just awful, but I did something that angered my mother. My mother told me she had enough of me and it was very difficult to love such an horrible child. I was told that I needed to pack up some of the things I wanted to keep with me because some people were going to take me away. I think she said that 'Gypsies were going to take me somewhere far away'. Can't quite remember if it was a my small suitcase of mine or a garbage bag, but I remember throwing a few toys inside. Bag in one hand, and my favorite stuffed monkey in the other, I can remember walking down the stairs crying. She told me that the people will be by in half an hour to get me and I needed to wait for them on the front porch steps. I remember walking out the front door alone, sitting out there for what felt like an eternity. It was at night and was dark out. We lived by a river so lots of bugs flying all over me and the single porch light. I kept thinking that I didn't know what I did wrong but I would make it better if only I had a chance. Not sure how long I was out there, but eventually my mother peaked her head out the door. She didn't walk up to me and hold my hand or put her arm around me, but just casually popped out her head out the door. She said ""I told them not to come get you because I decided I was going to give you one more chance"". I was so messed up in the head that this made me happy. I could have another chance at trying to earn my mothers love. 

Her abuse also changed as I got older. She got lazy and yet more direct. She didn't try to hide the physical like she used to. Instead of sitting me down and beating me until welts formed, it would be a hard slap to the face or something else quick and hard that would really hurt, but never leaving any long lasting mark. She seemed to get more irritable and far more angry on a regular basis. She would scream at or about anything she didn't like and just blurt out whatever insult she had to give, at least to family members and especially me. The psychological became more direct and intense, but just as effective to a 9 year old to preteen boy with growing social anxieties and impressionable behaviors. Her manipulation became far less creative, but the emotional damage had already been done years ago. She no longer tried to twist around with my emotions and feelings and changed to more direct insults. I was now simply pathetic and would never amount to anything. One of her favorite sayings became ""You are as worthless as tits on a boar"". I could fill a book on all my experiences. 

So now fast forward to me as an adult and the many consequences of the years of trauma I suffered. Her manipulation made me fail to understand what real love was like. Not only in how to give it properly, but how to receive it. When it was given to me, it just felt foreign. I didn't understand it and if I wasn't outright rejecting it, it questioned it heavily. My therapist would later tell me that as a child I learned that love equated to acts of service. You do things for others and they do them for you. Doing things was how someone showed they loved and needed you. Even now, genuine love and happiness feels so incredibly distant. I laugh at jokes and enjoy a good movie just like everyone else, but true long term happiness seems like something everyone else feels but me. Love, happiness and positive emotions get processed differently in me, sort of muted. I think it feels like trying to recall an old memory. Most everyone can remember various details like actions and events, what you saw and heard. Some people can recall an entire movie word for word and scene for scene. It is different when remembering an event when you felt passion and joy, or sensations like the feeling of a good backrub, or the sun shining on your face. You lose something when trying to recall a sensation you have *felt* from a memory. It just isn't the same as feeling it in the moment. When I experience love, joy, and most other positive emotions, it is like recalling an old memory that included those feelings. 

There are many other consequences from my childhood that even recently I am still learning about. I find it difficult to give as well as accept appreciation and trust with others. Everything as a child had strings attached or was not genuine. I have difficulty trusting or opening up and even being honest with authority figures, friends, family, and people I love. I find I often am quick to judge and blame others. The teenager in me learned that if your own parent can't have a decent heart then the average person is probably 10x worse. Due to my mothers explosive attitude, I learned how to not only walk on eggshells but to read any person or situation and be alert to any potential danger. It made me a great troubleshooter in many ways and allowed me to learn how to look out for, avoid and ultimately solve any problem that comes my way. As long as there is a solution, I don't panic, I analyze and figure it out. The other side of that is opposite; situations where I have no control, especially if it is tense and no positive outcome is likely, are extremely difficult for to deal with. I do not handle no-win situations, most especially when it comes to people. 

There is a strange middle ground that is absent in me. The kid in me still craves acceptance and affection and will take in any hurt, blame, and guilt away from someone so that person can feel better, even if it is at my own expense, and even if I was never the problem in the first place. The kid in me wants to make the world and everyone in it feel better and will accept any burden, add it to the rest of the others on his shoulders and just keep moving on. I spent my childhood being a martyr so it just doesn't affect me anymore. On the other hand, the adult in me often finds it difficult to connect, or even care about other people. Even those who are very close to me. I could walk away from my life, my family, friends, all relationships, and and all loved ones and never speak to them again and likely be absolutely fine about it. Both sides of me are pretty extreme and it feels like it is a constant battle to see which one will win in any given situation. There is a very strange emotional disconnect in me, with most anything or anyone around me, and no matter how much I try to fill this gap and crate those feelings I should have, I just can't. When it comes to my natural resting state of emotions, it is pretty much varying levels of emptiness and sometimes feelings of pain. I have spent quite a few years in therapy and am on medication, and while it does help, it just cannot bring back what was lost in the little child inside me. 

TL;DR: The abuse I suffered from my childhood caused far more long term damage than I ever could have imagined. Only now, in my 40's, am I really understanding how deep it goes. Do not wait to get help if you have had any kind of troubled childhood. The longer you wait, the more those problems set in and become a part of who you are.",26Jun2019,1

151,"So I’ve always acted a bit differently around friends and the people I care about. I don’t necessarily act weird, but sometimes it feels like they’re normal and I’m not. Just some of the things I do. I don’t know how to explain it.

I’ve also always had anxiety issues and (slight) anger issues at times, but over this year things have been getting worse. I’ve been having mood swings like crazy, I’ve been impulsive (usually in the form of me saying things and then looking back on them with extreme regret), my anxiety is getting worse, and I’ve just been extremely insecure recently. I’ve also had random bouts of anger and/or sadness. For no reason whatsoever. Just yesterday I was extremely stressed and angry for about an hour or two, and my breathing was all off, for no reason. And sometimes I just have random periods where I feel empty or really sad for no reason, and they usually last 2-5 hours, and during them I just lay down and I don’t even want to get up or go on my phone or do anything, I just feel really lonely and sad all of a sudden.

On top of this I’ve been paranoid as of recent, over existential related things mainly but just everything as a whole. It’s ridiculous because I’m concocting all of these scenarios and thinking about all of these things that I shouldn’t be worried about. Because of this I’ve been very restless, getting usually about 4-5 hours of sleep a night.

As far as me acting differently around people, I have random bouts of energy, too much energy where I get all excited, reckless and energetic, once again, for no reason. I’m also very clingy and it’s like I don’t know how to act. It feels like I’m crazy sometimes. I don’t know why I’m just doing the things that I am, and feeling the way that I am.

152,"I was diagnosed with a number of things growing up. ADD, ADHD, Aspergers Syndrome, and Just ""On the spectrum"" I am just off my latest semester of college. Unemployed and in a temporary living situation that will not last the month. My financial situation does not allow me the living or financial means to continue going to college. Getting no response from any jobs I apply too. I don't know what the right resources are. Looking for a psychologist online found me at a rehab clinic who told me to try the 211 hotline. I found a mental health clinic and after two visits over the span of one month I got recommended to another possibly local mental health clinic who do not take medi-care. I have no other form of health insurance.

156,"To the individual who has loved and lost:

Maybe it has been years or possibly only days. Today could be the anniversary of a special day, maybe the cardinal outside your window is a reminder of the one you miss, or the rainbow following the storm was a sign of hope. I want you to know that it is okay to remember. I want you to know that it is only a myth that time heals. It is okay to feel bad. You never replace what you have lost and the conflicting emotions you have today are normal. I want you to know it is okay to think of the person you have lost and to wonder about how different life is now, now that the person you loved is gone.

To the individual I loved and lost:

I want you to know that I think of you often. So many times I have wanted to pick up the phone and call you. I know it seems silly, I know you will not answer but I do wonder what you would say if we could talk. In my head I create scenarios. I come up with responses such as, “blah, blah, blah… you don’t know my life...” or “yes, anything you need Sweetie.” I make decisions based on the opinion of someone I can no longer ask. The choices I make are sometimes based on words or phrases I can only imagine in my head since you’re no longer here to say them out loud. We think of you all the time and wonder what corny joke would you have to share. What sarcastic comment would you make?

On the good days, I smile as I wonder what you’re doing now. I wonder if you’re dancing in the heavens, playing pranks, baking pies, gardening, farming the richest soil, riding the motorcycle on the most beautiful landscape imaginable, or if your toes are digging in the whitest sand overlooking the most beautiful sunset. I imagine you laughing, I imagine you at peace. I imagine those around you smiling because of the joy you bring. Then I pause, and I think, “Crap. Did you just see me do that? Are you really watching over me? Over us?” I wonder if you find humor in the silly things I do or the stumbles I may have. I wonder if you shake your head in disbelief at statements I make or jump up with excitement if I do something that makes you proud.

I sit and I wonder. It’s been quite the journey without you here. I know I am not the only one hurting. I know others miss you as well. I wonder if they think of you as often as I do or if they play out the scenarios in their head, replay your response, and look at photos and remember entire conversations. I hope you know you were loved; I pray you know how much you are missed.

I sometimes wonder if you’d forgive me for what I did or didn’t do that caused you hurt when you were still here. I hope that now you see and know how much I really cared, how influential you actually were in my life. I regret I did not always tell you. If I told you a million times before how much I loved you, I wish I could tell you a million more. I know nothing in life is guaranteed, your time was up and I have to accept that. I can accept that you are no longer here and I will move forward, but I will not let go.

I will move forward and forever have you influencing who I am, what I do, and the relationships that I develop. Who I am now is because of you. Grief is full of conflicting emotions and part of moving forward in my life is acknowledging what I lost when you left. You cannot be replaced. The role you had in my life has contributed to who I am, the experiences I have endured, the beliefs I have developed, and my perceptions regarding myself, others, the world, and my future.

Until I lost you. grief was a myth. It was something I had heard of but barely understood. I could sympathize with others but to empathize was hard. Every loss is personal; it is based on each individual relationship. To me you were a father, a brother, a grandparent. To someone else, you were a spouse, a son, a father. I cannot expect anyone else to get it, to understand the grief I have. Losing you was hard. Losing myself is not an option. I want to live, I want to experience, I want to move forward.

I now know that time does not heal, that feeling bad is okay, that I can fill the empty chair but you can never be replaced, and that some things cannot be fixed. Not all wounds are meant to heal. Some wounds are meant to be remembered, the scars are lessons learned, tragedy we overcame, and hope for the future. Those wounds, those scars help me move forward. It allows me to focus on what I have presently, what I can do, the relationships I’m building, and the memories I can create. I don’t want to forget you and who you were, the good, the bad, and everything in between. I want you to know that although I wonder about you, I think of you often, I am moving forward in my life, and I’m taking you with me.

Then i feel a lump get stuck in my throat and cry, but crying doesnt help. If i try talk to someone, they are shocked that I could be ""depressed"" or have any ""problems"", but I do and I feel so invalidated anytime I try to talk to anyone. 
How can i express myself in a healthy way without anybody. Im alone. I feel like I cant talk sometimes when all I ever wish for is open communication.",26Jun2019,4
161,"i’ve always had depression and i’ve always been able to deal with it to an extent. but recently i got really drunk one night and i think i became manic and i couldn’t control myself (hearing voices telling me to do stuff) and i harmed myself. 

since then i’ve been really depressed and i don’t know what to do. 

i’ve had this manic thing happen before but it was never as bad as that night. 

i’m scared it happens again and i can’t control it.

162,"So one of the problems that i have and i HATE about me is being told something and having pretty much all the information given to me go right through my head. I try my absolute best to understand what someone has said to me but i just cant seem to put it together and understand it. This happens almost only at work for me. While outside of work i face a feeling of i WANT to do something but i dont want to do it..? not sure if that makes sense but thats how i feel. I know i want to finish this task but theres this weight holding me down from doing it. I have no idea what these problems could be but it makes life terrible. 

Any help would be much appreciated!

163,"Now, this isn’t about me, but about a saddening death a few days ago, Eticka. He’s a YouTube who had committed suicide. A day after his body was found, [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOjRAkq9NNSPBgxljkFDAGg) makes a [clickbait video](https://youtu.be/1sWzUYMpxws)about “summoning his ghost”. I’m just trying to spread awareness and so you can report [the video](https://youtu.be/1sWzUYMpxws) and [his channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOjRAkq9NNSPBgxljkFDAGg) . Thank you for your time.

Also, if you are in a similar mental state as Eticka, please search for the suicide hotline for your country.",26Jun2019,1
164,"So I'm gonna give you a run down of my life. It's long and for that I'm sorry.

My dad has never treated me like he does with my older sister. You can tell he treats her like royalty and I'm a peasant. Because of that, I've always tried to get ""I'm proud of you"" saying out of his mouth. We had foreign exchange students living at our house and they got his love/attention but not me. I've cried nearly every day for 2 years because i felt like i wasn't good enough. He has always teased about my life, but it recently gotten worse as time when on. 

My mom, she was in my life but barely since she was in nursing school. My mom always treated me like I was dumb and that honestly hurt. She put me in special need classes because she felt like i needed the special attention. I didn't. I gave up in high school and didn't care about grades or anything. I was super depressed in high school and no one helped. My mom kept saying, I'm 
"" special."" Even though i wasn't. 

My sister, she's older than me and honestly she has the best life. I'm jealous. Except when she got pregnant at 16. She went to camp on several occasions, has friends, way prettier than me, and got loved by everyone. I didn't have that. I couldn't go to camp, i couldn't make friends, i was told by EVERYONE that my sister was hot and i got hit with the ugly stick and no one told me they loved me. 

When i was younger, i remembered my mom came home from a late night. She was tired but she found my sister and i on the couch waiting for her to come home. My sister was sleeping and i was half awake. I saw her tucking in my sister at night but not me. She whispered to her ear, ""i love you."" I was waiting for my turn and she left the room. I cried to myself because i knew she didn't care about me. 

Here's me. I'm currently 22, a single mom, living my parent's basement. Has a very low paying job, and cannot keep a job. Baby daddy abused the hell out of me, emotionally and mentally. I was always labeled as ""the fat hairy emo girl"" throughout high school. I was pregnant at 19 and only has one friend. I don't have anyone to talk to. My boyfriend's mom doesn't like me and tries to make my life hell because i had an abortion. I never done anything in my life to make my family proud of me.  There's days i don't feel like I'm not even a good mom.",26Jun2019,1
165,"So I know a guy (for a very very long time) and I think he might be a sociopath but I am not sure.

Why do I think that? 

He is a liar, lies about pretty much everything for the most part to make himself seem good, and he is actually pretty good at it. 

He's socially skilled, he can get pretty much any job (even tho never stays in one for more than 3 months, had like 10+ jobs in the past 2-3 years), 

people look up to him in his social groups...

Very irresponsible and lives off other peoples stuff (for example he lives off his wife earned money).

Never takes responsibility for the mistakes he does, always blames the people around him (sometimes saying that those

people envy him).. or he admits he's wrong but he does it to make you feel sorry about him.

Sometimes  gifts stuff to other people (close people to him) not because he cares about the other person but because its like an exchange for something that he may want. 

Finally he does messed up things to people that he should care like for example he got his parents into debt, promised big things to his family and actually never did them, in a way that makes me feel like he has no empathy.",26Jun2019,0
166,"generally when it’s delivered by certain people, if someone makes a small comment that’s negative towards me puts me in a horrible mood and i have seconds before it gets to me and i break down crying. 

simple things like “i didn’t ask you.” “why are you here.” “leave.” and insults really hurt me. generally these comments come with a tone where i know it’s not positive or sarcastic. 

people laughing with me when i make a mistake often also just make me feel worthless, and jokes about me making the mistakes are even worse (i fall a lot and forget things) 

i’m 18 and i feel like these shouldn’t effect me anymore.",26Jun2019,1
167,"So, I am in an internship. I work in a physio rehab clinic as an internship... Ever since i first started, i swore the office manager always glared at me when I walked in, or just straight up avoided me like the plague. At first, i didn't really notice. However as time went on I realized it kind of escalated, i.e. , I would be in the staff room, she would walk in, look right at me, and just walk back out (because I was the only one in the room...)

&amp;#x200B;

From that point on i swore everyone lowkey thought i was ugly af, and wanted to avoid me, or thought i was a loser, or whatever. I can't stop looking into my coworkers eyes and immedieately feel judged, and shitty.   
Idk why but it is really beggining to bother me. I wish I knew what I did to cause all this, but its just radio silence.   
I just want to have a pleasant experience and do my best during my internship... but I feel like just by existing, i get snubbed and avoided, as if i did something terrible.",26Jun2019,1
168,"I used to work for counselors in college and the process was so clinical, it sort of made me always conclude I didnt have a problem worth taking up someones time.  

I burn myself a lot, it makes me feel the good feeling working out to complete exhaustion doesnt give me anymore. I havent had a good day in the past year. Teetering between ""bullshitting through the day"" and ""please dont notice me in the middle of the road.""  

Its kinda come to a head when my boss straight up said ive not looked good in weeks, I stare off into the distance while driving and get drunk 3-4 days a week.  I cant talk to anyone, nothing goes through my head. 

I just dont know how deal with this",26Jun2019,3
169,"I’m from a country that has developed tremendously over the past couple of decades. Luckily, I was eventually adopted by a military family, but prior to that, it was rough. Before getting adopted, my biological mother and father’s marriage was always rocky. My mother went through manic and was extremely abusive to me and my father. They had barely enough money to feed themselves, so I was extra baggage. Eventually the relationship fizzed out, and they divorced. 
Child care was too expensive, so I couch surfed at my aunt’s, uncle’s, or grandmother’s homes. My mother was able to take me back to take care of me, but that didn’t last long. The plan was for her to get us passports and move us to the U.S. Instead, she left me on the side of the street with a small luggage in front of my aunt’s house. Let’s just say I was no Christmas present, but my aunt was able to find me and take me in temporarily (she had her own son to raise).
This all happened since birth through 5 (age I was adopted). Along the way, some other terrible things happened which I won’t mention, but now I’m 25-years-old with abandonment issues, fear of commitment, fear of sex, fear of being alone, bipolar II disorder, and an addictive personality.
When people look at my life at surface value, it’s great. Premed student, doing financially well for myself, but if they dug a little deeper, my life is pretty pathetic and lonely. I want a relationship more than anything, and I’ve had amazing people come into my life, but I have such distrust toward partners, I cut them loose. I guess that’s my coping mechanism. In order to combat my fear of abandonment, I abandon them first. It’s a vicious cycle and I want it to stop. I’ve been through therapy, and I can’t say I’m fully over my past. I have “mommy issues” and never felt a sense of belonging in any family.
It’s why I want my own family, but it’s hard to get there without taking all the steps prior to it. I’m cynical when it comes to lasting love because both sets of my parents divorced, my sister’s husband cheated on her, and divorce rates are at 50%! Some days it seems easier living a life of solitude where no one can hurt you, but even that gets painful.
Maybe I have resentment toward my biological mother, maybe I don’t. I just hate how someone can hurt you, and you’re left dealing with the consequences for the rest of your life. How does anyone get over the fear of abandonment?",26Jun2019,1
