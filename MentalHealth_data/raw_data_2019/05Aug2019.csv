0,"""It's a self-fullfilling prophecy, if you think people won't like you, they really won't. So change your thoughts!""

That's so easy to say if you've had a normal life and experienced acceptance, but what if your whole life experience is the oppossite? What if people tolerated you at best and once you turned your back they showed just how little they actually liked you? And you tried to make friends but each and every attempt failed and pushed people away? How is one supposed to stop thinking that people don't like you when that's the only experience you've ever had? How am I supposed to even want approach people when every experience has been negative? When even people I'd never interacted with would make sure I'd understand they disliked me with a look of disgust in their face, roll of their eyes and looking elsewhere if we crossed paths somewhere randomly?

Is it really any surprise that such thoughts would pop into my mind at all when its been my life story, from introduction to end? Or that I would try to come up with reasons as to why this is? How ballsy is it for the very root of my mental problems to tell me that, really, it's all my fault for allowing my brain to have such thought patterns. THat I should just be myself, shine, give my light to people because oooh they've always been so receptive, how could you NOT SEE IT?

Anyway, has anyone with similar experiences managed to confront this in a realistic way? Because mind you, telling my brain that all of my memories are somehow wrong has proven completely useless.",05Aug2019,1
1,"I’m actually so pathetic. I ruined everything tonight. I feel so stressed out about my college work and having exams in less than 2 weeks and several coursework that when I had an inkling that the guy I’m dating could be talking to other girls. I flipped and blocked him on everything without explanation. Now he just doesn’t want to talk to me. We were an on and off thing never made it official. But I just wanted him to be with me and not be interested in other girls...the thing was he didn’t want me talking to other guys but I was pretty sure he was still chatting to other girls. But when I would ask him he would deny it and tell me I was just busy working. Which was believable because he works very hard and works different hours and shifts. I feel like a bitch for just blocking without reason but he no longer wants to hear my reason and I think he’s already moved on to another girl..??? But I could be wrong. I don’t even know. I am so down into my own little shitty world and feel super stressed and depressed that I physically feel sick of all the emotions penting up inside me. I do have a history of depression, anxiety and panic attacks with a few attempts at suicide. But I no longer have the courage to kill myself or go see the doctor because of the type of burden I feel on everyone. A paramedic has even told me that I tried to kill myself for attention while being checked up for an overdose on my meds. So I don’t know how to seek help anymore because of my past. And I feel like no one can help me and I don’t know where to go from now on. I just feel like ai betrayed myself and the people that trusted me. Like my issues shouldn’t have become someone else’s. I feel so pathetic too because I keep messaging him but he doesn’t care to open it or read it. And I feel so shit that I can no longer focus on my education or even anything for that matter. The cherry on top is that I juggle work, college and everything else in my life and try and fit it into the 24hrs given. And pretending to be happy and everything is fine and dandy doesn’t cut out for me anymore. Sorry I just wanted to open up somewhere. You guys can roast me now. 🙂 Thank you for being reddit.",05Aug2019,1

3,"So, recently on the 19th. I tried to kill myself. Clearly it didnt work. I had been slowly declining everything had been getting slightly more annoying and more difficult. 

Quite honestly I wish it had worked. I quite honestly do. I've had problems cutting for years now. And generalised self harm in the forms of starving, hitting myself, smoking, taking drugs and the like has just been a part of me for a while. 

But I had been doing good on the cutting part I was sh free for a while. But I got tipped over the edge ran out of the house and obviously attempted to end my life. Ended up going to the hospital, 6 stitches in 2 cuts. And now I'm here wishing I hadnt stopped.

I think that might be my 8th or 9th attempt in the last 3 years honestly. And It gets to that point where i realise I cant even do that right, the one thing that could help i screwed up. And that hits home. 

I wanted therapy for a while. I know people who pay for it, get diagnosed and sort themselves out and get some closure. But I come from a family that makes 11k a year. We cant afford to do our house up properly or pay for anything that's not pre owned. I have to go through all of these shitty free mental health programmes when none of them take me seriously. If I got a diagnosis I woukdnt complain, I'd say thank you because I want closure. I want something. I'm tired of feeling crazy",05Aug2019,4
4,"Hello, all. I’m glad I found this place. 

My girlfriend has been struggling with her mental health longer than I have known her. I’ve known her for three years and have been dating nearly as long. I’ve been at her side through some dark places and a few attempts. 

Recently, she took the initiative to seek the help of a psychiatrist and get back on some medication. She’s on abilify and prozac I believe. It’s some pretty high dosage I think too and it just takes all the life out of her. She tells me she can’t feel, even for me. I try not to take it personally because it isn’t about me. 

However, she knows me to be an affectionate man and appreciate it in return as well. I’m cooling down on needing it but at times she feels like it isn’t fair to me. 

How can I be supportive of her and stay at her side without her feeling like she’s ruining our relationship since she can’t really feel? What kinds of things can I say or do?",05Aug2019,30

7,"I’ve been diagnosed with severe anxiety, depression and PTSD. I’ve been dealing with my anxiety and depression since I was 13. I find it extremely difficult to look for a job. I feel like I’m on the verge of being a statistic, homeless veteran with mental issues.",05Aug2019,6
8,"After dealing with my own mental health issues from 15, I had a moment of thought where I realised I had to change the way our society viewed mental health issues so that we, as people, can openly talk about our mental health as easily as our physical health. I could no longer sit around and not contribute to the cause of achieving this, knowing that people younger than me were dealing with similar issues completely alone.

Once I had got to a better place myself where I knew that I was in a position to help others, I decided to make this change myself. I am now 18 and I started a project/organisation back in September of 2018 when I was 17. I called it [**Mind The Stairs**](https://www.mindthestairs.org) for various reasons (particularly due to the ""mind"" being both a warning for the tough journey ahead, as well as the notion of mental health. I also believe that stairs was suitable due to the journey back up to a better place). 

On starting Mind The Stairs, I wanted to set out three main aims; **eliminate the social stigma** surrounding mental health, **provide information with easy access** that may not already be provided online, and to **educate young people**. Now, I knew that when I started this, it would be no easy feat due to the current state of our society but I refused to let any hurdles prevent me from achieving this. Within the first few weeks of starting this project, we amassed over 2000 followers on our instagram page, thousands of views on our blog as well as numerous celebrities sharing our message. Our blog focuses on sharing young people's own experiences and their recovery through non-anonymous posts in the hope that slowly, young people around the world will be able to take something away from what they have read, understand just how common it is, and especially to spark conversation more widely. 

I wanted to focus on young people in particular due to the exceeding number of people between the ages of 11 and 25 who have had to face such challenges in a world where they shouldn't have to deal with these issues at an age where enjoyment should be a priority. I believed that what I could do would be substantially different to other projects and organisations that already existed because I am one of those young people who has dealt with issues faced by us young people in this modern world. 

Mind The Stairs has now been relaunched after having to take time away for exams, it is here to stay. There are so many additions and changes coming in the near future but what is really needed is for people to spread our word so that together we can make our world a better place. 

Everyone has been affected by mental health in some way whether that be directly or indirectly. If you would like to make a difference, please share this post, share our social media pages and website, email us, or simply talk about what you're going through yourself with someone close to you.

Conversation is so important because it's the start of your journey to recovering. This project isn't about recognition nor is it about anything other than helping people to understand their mental health and how we can really make progress together. 

I hope that you believe in this as much as I do and you decide to support what I started because none of this is possible without all of us working together. If we focus on our future generation, we can deal with the problems early on and create a world where mental health is spoken about.

Thank you,

Hugo

9,"This is probably too specific for anyone to relate...

I've been struggling with agoraphobia for about 4 years, and currently I'm able to leave my house if I have a safe person. I can't go anywhere alone, ever, and I have to know the building and be able to escape. I can go in places for brief periods under these circumstances, if I have to. Mostly though, I'm at home or at my mother in law's, or therapy. I can count on one hand the number of people I see in a month- all but one are related to me. The last several weeks I've been pretty limited in going outside. I go days without stepping out the door.

My husband has applied for a ministry job at the church he's been attending. I've gone a few times but am not comfortable with the building and am always worried I'm going to have a panic attack or faint or die or lose control. I haven't been in months. 

In order for him to get the job, it requires that we both become members. The pastor is aware that I have anxiety but doesn't know the full extent, and I don't want to keep my hubby from getting this much needed job just because I don't want to take a membership class, or give my testimony in front of the elders. 

I don't want to have to explain my disorder to the church, and the elders might wonder why I want to be a member but never attend. I don't want that to be the first and only thing people know about me. But the truth is that my anxiety can be pretty pervasive.  Sometimes I think the world is ending (today) or that I'm dying. I haven't been able to work in 3 years. Even if I'm not in the middle of a panic attack, going out makes me nauseous. 

Idk. I'm just frustrated because I'm feeling trapped and like I'm about to be forced out of the house and into a church community and I'm not there yet, but I want my husband to get this job and so I feel like I have no choice. 

The pastor's wife keeps inviting us over for dinner and we keep turning down the invite because of me, and now some other lady is asking our housemate if the three of us could go to lunch sometime so she can get to know me.

I don't want to be known. I want to shrink so that they can't see me. I'm so awkward. Just hire him and leave me be.",05Aug2019,8
10,"But anger and sadness are choices. Depression is a valid illness, yes, but how do we get better? The desire to be better. If you go into therapy not wanting it, i promise that it will not get better. Medication and therapy will not help unless you want to get better. Actively try to be happy. Instead of anger, try to learn patience, instead of sadness, try to learn contentment, instead of jealousy and envy, try to learn love and understanding. We wont get better if we dont want to. I learned this after so many years of being an angry, depressed psychotic. You gotta learn how to roll with the punches. One setback, two setbacks, even 20, does not equate to the end of your life. Every failure is a lesson waiting to be learned. Everytime we fall, we learn how to better handle it the next time it happens. Nobody is perfect.",05Aug2019,6

I was diagnosed with ADHD, GAD, BPD/Symptoms of PD in cluster B/SAD/Depression &amp; sensory hypersensitivity.

ADHD, depression and sensory hypersensitivity makes sense, but nothing else!!

Else I dont meet the criteria for anything else.

I dont think I have those disorders, but instead something like Autism.

Seriously, they just took symptoms of it and put it in different diagnosis. 

Has anyone dealt with things similar to this?? How did you figure your real diagnosis out? how much time did it take?

I am a 16f in QC, Canada, so if you have any info about diagnosis in the country it would be useful too!!

12,"Ok so for the past 4 years I've been dealing with these random episodes of depression and anxiety that stay for a week or so and then fade away. They always arise at crucial moments in my life like when I have exams, have to do presentations or have parties to go to. What I wrote below was written shortly after one of these ""episodes"", this one being the worst (you don't have to read all that lol).  I had a panic attack before my chemistry exam. I think my doctor called it a *panic episode.* After the end of it, I thought I was good but know that senior year of high school is approaching i'm afraid of what will happen if I experience this again, during the most impactful points in my academic journey :/ I've tried therapy but talking to some random person about my problems just isn't my cup of tea. These clearly show up at stressful points in my life but I just can't find a way to cope with it. Its been 8 months since my last one. Before the last, it was year. I'm feeling pretty good atm but I never know when it goes down hill. 

&gt;The past few months could possibly be labelled as one of the lowest points in my life. It was probably near the end of November, when a switch turned on and I suddenly felt so worthless. I don’t know what the trigger was but all I know is that it wasn’t the fault of anyone else; it was me. Everyone has bad days, so I brushed it off as one, but as days went by I felt the self-loathing getting worse. My mental state started to show as physical symptoms. At the time, I didn’t know that it was my mental health that was suffering so I went to the doctor multiple times trying to figure out what the problem was. And as if life could not get any worse, exams came rolling around and I wasn’t prepared. I studied like hell so I was prepared in that sense, but my mind wasn’t. The few days before exams, I was a mess. I somehow pulled through the first exam. The second exam (biology) was a nightmare because I had a panic attack in the midst of it(woohoo). My English exam was ok because I had to write an essay which comes fairly easy to me. My last exam: chemistry. I didn’t even make it to the exam room, let’s just leave it at that. At this point, I absolutely hate myself which is what started it all so one can imagine that it only got worse BUT my parents were like angels sent from heaven to say the least. You see, my parents probably suffered as much I did during this time. They brought me to the doctor, made me healthy food, and most importantly tried to talk to and understand me. They were new to the idea of “mental health”. They always thought “you have food, a shelter, access to education and helpful parents...what could possibly be the problem?”. But once they saw what I was going through, they realized that happiness involves a healthy state of mind. We had a couple of deep, thoughtful conversations and it helped me. After all of this, I visited the doctor again and after a little conversation and a survey, I was told that I’ve been silently hurting far longer than just 3 months. This just happened to be the time when I reached my limit. On the car ride home from the doctors office that day, I cried waterfalls. I didn’t feel sad but I just cried and couldn’t stop because honestly I couldn’t agree more. Thankfully, I got to start fresh. A new semester started and I wanted to use this opportunity to live a happier life. Although I was hesitant, I built up the courage to open up to my close friends and they were so supportive. Needless to say, my little sis was always there to listen. I stopped putting so much of my life’s worth on my grades and others opinions of me. I have to admit, my grades did suffer a little from this experience and I was very frustrated. But on the bright side, if I hadn’t worked so hard throughout the semester to keep my grades high, they would have suffered more than they did. I’m on a long road to recovery and I can’t wait for anything else life has to come my way😊

The ending sounds so positive but this is what i think after every episode so idk",05Aug2019,1

15,"My husband checked into the e.r. today at my request as he told me he thinks about suicide on a daily basis. He's been severely depressed for a year at least and he's been exhibiting several self destructive behaviors during that time as well. I (naively, I guess) expected that he would be discharged by tonight or perhaps in a couple of days.

I am terrified. 

Terrified because I have days when getting out of bed is like moving a mountain. All I can do is lie there, not even getting up to eat. My mental illness is like dragging around a weight in every aspect of my life. Given the nature of the job and the nature of the company, I can't reasonably believe that I can be allowed time off for clinic appointments and stuff. Orientation was on Friday and I spent 9 hours in a room full of other humans I didn't know, being told how awesome customers are, how important food safety is, etc. and that doing everything the right way ensures that our salaries are always paid. 

After that day, I was more mentally exhausted than I have ever been in a while. I know that the job will be even more mentally exhausting than that.

I got a little bit of it in the past when I was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome but in the past few years I have gotten nothing except ocd medication. 

1. My parents won’t take me to therapy, don’t know why exactly, either they don’t want to pay for it, or my best guess is that they just don’t know where to get it. They just tell me to take the meds even though I don’t (which I probably should anyway) since they have no idea how to help me

2. I don’t have a school counselor. It would be great if I went to a public school, a blessing, since most of them have counselors who can get you toward the help you need but nope, just my luck I’ve went to a private Christian school since I was a child and they have no mental health counselor whatsoever, nothing. I’m not going to talk to any of the teachers there about it. I’m not Christian so I will probably get religious advice that would not help me.

I think my only hope at this point is to graduate high school in a few years and try to pull myself out of this cycle of anxiety and self-loathing on my own but it’s really hard.

I don't remember going to sleep, but I woke up around 9 am and I was still that way. it's the best I've ever felt, but at the same time it wasn't very healthy because even when friends would joke around with me I'd take it as disrespect and be like ""do they even know who I am????"" it was super strange. around 3 pm that day for about a hour I could feel my body calming down and I went back to feeling horrible. on Sunday morning, it came back and I was at church acting like I was on drugs, we had a dinner and I remember talking to random people and jumping up and down in chairs. later that day it stopped and ever since then I've consistently felt awful.

I'm hoping that maybe... someone here will have answers that I don't.

I've always suffered with depression, and I have BPD. 

I've been off anti-depressants for years now, but some time ago it started creeping back in. It got so bad that I was completely unable to work and subsequently lost my well-paid job. I'm paranoid, unable to leave the house, barely eat, and my grip on reality has become pretty loose.

I tried to go back on Citalopram, but I've left it so long, I'm at what I feel is the point of no return, because the initial worsening of the anxiety is just way too extreme, even at a low dose. 

I'm scared of everything that could potentially make it worse even if it makes no logical sense. scared of caffeine,  medications I've been taking for years (I'd die without them, I know that, but still). Scared of doctors after the Citalopram experience. I was prescribed Quintiapine, but haven't taken them. 

My anxiety causes extreme vertigo, and I feel like I'm going to pass out all the time, I disassociate during conversations, I question reality, I often think that chemicals in the water are making me this way (it makes sense to me at the time).

I have virtually no escape from it, no comfort zones. I genuinely feel I only have one option left to help myself.

Chatting with a new guy I'm dating via PM and he mentioned he had to go work in another bar, I misread and thought he was talking about the swingers bar in town...made a few comments like 'are you serious?' and made a joke asking if he joined in...it was not the swingers bar, it was a bar called Sinners. He realized my mistake and asked me if I thought he said swingers bar...I said no, nevermind and then I claimed I just made a silly joke (I guess I could claim I was asking if he sinned) and moved the conversation on. 

That's it. That's the something little. 

It's a tiny thing but I'm so weirdly embarrassed and anxious about it that it's triggered off suicidal thoughts. I feel uncomfortable and can't let it go, I should be asleep but I feel too worked up.

This is not the only time something like this has happened, this is exactly why I'm so anxious when it comes to talking to people or interacting with others in any way; I mess up too often and if I do the feeling of embarrassment is too much.

23,"I am suffering and I don't know what do anymore. I don't even know where to begin. I feel empty, helpless, I feel dead inside

I fell in love years ago with this girl. We were in a relationship for 2 years...it was a great relationship, a lot of it was puppy love at first, I guess it just felt nice, we were both kids (20) at the time. No fights, no arguments...

eventually she left me, and I feel so extremely hurt and broken in my brain, heart and soul without her.

I was never weak like this when I was with her. She had issues of her own though, anxiety and such.

After she left, she moved on to someone else and has been with them ever since.

I was told to ignore them, focus on other things, work on myself, time heals all wounds and every other bullshit platitude in the book...I've been doing that for almost a decade now, and I fell as dead inside, in my gut, as I did back then.

She is currently friends with my best friend....they work together. Which makes exposure via social media painful.

The obvious answer is ""get off social media"" but the problem is bigger than that. I've done that, blocking her, deleting her, pretending she doesn't exist, whatever, it doesn't help. Nothing helps. Getting off social media won't get rid of this pain

I see pictures and hear stories of her and she has blossomed into this amazing, confident woman I always knew she could be, and I makes me so, so, so fucking sad that I want to die

When we were together she had issues, a lot dealing with self-esteem..but I tried my best to help her through...I tried telling her she was an amazing, flawless, perfect woman, but she never believed it or took it to heart, I guess. I learned that no matter how much you love someone, you can't make them stay, and as I'm older now, I realize why she left probably didn't really have anything to do with me, but rather her own demons

Now realizing she left me, got help she needed and is now just...flawless. She exudes beauty, grace, sexiness, confidence, everything I knew she could be and wanted to help her be, and she did it without me, and has probably forgotten I exist.

In life almost anything is fixable, I've found. You can change career if you're unhappy with your job, you can move if you don't like your house. I was unhappy with my job, so I'm bakc in school changing my path...but there is no fix for what I feel. My love for this woman is so deep and unrelenting, and the worst pain I can feel or ever have felt, and it will never be resolved because I can never have her.

There is no fix, there is no repair, there is nothing that will fix this. All that will fix that is her, and she probably barely even knows I exist.

I've tried journaling, I've tried putting these feelings into my art, I've tried ignoring her existence, I've tried every advice in the book and still all these years later not a day goes by that I don't think about trying to get in touch with her again. I'm even in therapy now about this, nothing helps.

I've been in denial about my feelings for her for years. I crack jokes at her expense, I pretend I hate her, I pretend I'm over her. but it's all a lie I guess, therapy has made me realize that. Made me realize she still owns my heart and mind, and makes me realize she wouldn't even bat an eye if I died

That feeling is the worst thing a human can experience. To love someone, have them love you, and you love them back because they're the embodiment of everything you want in a person, in a lover, in a lifelong mate, in a mother for your children...to have that person leave and never look back is an indescribable blackness I don't think I can ever wish on someone.

These feelings have become more prevalent and extreme since I started therapy a month ago.  Just because I've talked about more frequently and in more detail than I have since she left years ago. Now the feelings and emotions attached to her are no longer buried like before, in fact, just seeing her face now...it's like a black tornado just ripped it's way through my stomach and chest and then my brain.

My friends are a second family to me. But I get a small tinge of rage, jealousy, anger everytime by best friend (a female, btw) brings up anythign related to my ex.

People tell me to date, get on tinder, it's just not for me. What's the point? I'm ugly and shy, I already found ""the person"". There's no point in looking at anyone else. I will never love that person.

I know I'm sick, I know I'm messed up. I just wish I wasn't anymore. It's going on a decade now of constant pain and longing for this person I can never have. I am so tired of hurting. I am so beat down. I am so lost on what to do with these feelings, with this situation...I just feel like I'm in a void, like I'm choking, like I'm in space. There's no air, it's dark and cold, and what's worse is, there's no end. It's infinite. No one cares enough to save me and they couldn't even if they wanted to. The only person who can save me likely forgot about me years ago

When she left and I was packing her things I wrote a short note to her and stuffed it in an album jacket of her. Months later, around christmas she sent me a photo of it sayig thanks, and in my stupid pride and anger I ignored her. Not a single day has gone by that I don't wonder and wish I'd done something different that night.

I just want this to stop, I want this pain to be gone, I don't WANT to have to quit social media and contact with people over this, I don't WANT to be the guy who has to tell my friends to act a certain way around me, I don't WANT to feel rage and upset when I hear her name, I don't want to think about her anymore, I don't want her inside me anymore. I'm not asking to hit the lottery, I'm not asking for anything, I'm not even asking to be happy, I just want to not feel this anymore",05Aug2019,4
24,So I get nervous a lot. Mostly like to distract myself so I can think about something else. One night I woke up very disoriented causes I just woke up. I felt a over whelming sense of dread. I never felt like this before. I felt so weird and wanted to kill myself because of this dread that I felt. I cried and then I forced myself to sleep cause I have no reason to be crying. Just wondering cause it was scary. 😬,05Aug2019,1
25,Alright...I finally gained the courage to post on Reddit after reading people’s post for over a year. So I don’t think I have anything nor have I been to the doctor to ask but this is how I’m doing. So at nighttime really often I get really upset and I can’t see myself achieving the really far out there goals that I have. I’ve never wanted a normal life with a Joe job and clocking in and out waiting for the weekend. I’m (19)(M) and I think about this a lot. Not meeting my own expectations. Also a lot of nights I think about stupid mistakes and times I’ve embarrassed myself in front of everyone... specifically 2 times with alcohol. I just feel alone a lot. I sometimes feel really confident and I can take on anything but sometimes I really miss having a girlfriend and feel like I need major help getting where I wanna be. I just feel like I spike all the time with my mood. I don’t tell anyone really because I was sorta made fun of/discredited when I brought it up once or twice. What do you think?,05Aug2019,1
26,"So, I've always had a trouble with this. My boyfriend feels depressed and has a low self-esteem. He'll tell me that he's not doing great and when I ask him what's wrong, he'll either tell me he doesn't know or doesn't want to talk about it. Which is fine, I respect his boundaries but I really want to do my best to cheer him up a bit. We usually play videogames together and that helps him for a bit. Although there are times in which we can't because his wifi isn't good. Any ideas on what I can do to help?",05Aug2019,1

And from the description of the video:

Law enforcement officers are increasingly the first responders to incidents involving people with mental illness. Without proper training and expertise, confrontations taking place amid an already-charged atmosphere can escalate quickly, often leading to the injury or death of the individual with mental illness. This concern and numerous high-profile police shootings involving unarmed individuals in a mental health crisis have prompted renewed debates about policing the mentally ill. In the San Antonio Police Department, a special plainclothes unit is trained specifically to handle mental health calls. For several weeks, we followed the 10-person unit to see firsthand how the program operates. One of the calls the unit received during this time was from Martha Remmey, the mother of a young man with schizophrenia who appeared unable to distinguish what was real and what wasn’t. Martha, who’s called the police on her son Christopher multiple times, is torn between wanting to get help for her son and fearing one of his confrontations with the police will turn deadly. In Houston, we meet with Marketta Thomas-Smith, who is mourning her brother Danny Ray Thomas. In March 2018, a sheriff’s deputy encountered Thomas in the middle of a Houston road. Thirty-four-year-old Thomas was unarmed and visibly in distress, walking with his pants around his ankles. But the deputy said Thomas ignored his commands and acted aggressively toward him, so he shot him once in the chest. As Marketta continues to grieve, she is also seeking justice for her brother.

28,"I’ve been quietly dealing with mental health issues for about as long as I can remember, but for the most part I’ve kept it under control. However, the past 6 months or so I’ve been getting progressively worse to the point where I almost don’t even feel like myself anymore. Long story short, I’m no longer able to effectively manage the symptoms I’m experiencing on my own but I don’t even know the first step to take in terms of finding help. I do have insurance, but how do I know who would take it? I’ve read that it’s good to start by asking your primary care doctor but I don’t even have one of those. Furthermore, does insurance fully cover the cost or will it be mostly out of pocket? If the latter, I cannot afford very much at all, and certainly not even close to the $100+ a session I see online.

Okay, maybe not ""Trauma"" per sé, but an event which changed my whole behavior and personality.

When I was five and younger, I was very outgoing and friendly. Apparently, I'd just go up to random people at the library and say, ""Hi! I'm *my name*!"" 
But ever since I turned six, something changed. I became very quiet and reserved, only venturing to talk to my closest friends. And now as I'm getting ready to go to college, I'm starting to come out of my shell again. 
Is this a normal process in six year old boys? I know plenty of young boys who didn't experience this, though. This is why my parents and I think something might have happened to make me totally change. Is there a way to know for sure? Am I being ridiculous?",05Aug2019,1

I’m a 17 year old highschool guy and a lot of the time I honestly don’t know how I feel. I have very self destructive tendencies that have lead me to certain substance abuse issues in the past. I’m currently one month sober and it’s pretty hard. 

   I don’t understand my friends or the people at my school. Everything they do or are interested in seems so foreign to me. I have friends but I struggle to truly connect with a lot of people because I feel like they’re not real I guess. I don’t know how to explain it but I go through phases where I cut off everyone I know and completely ghost them. Then two weeks later I’ll try to contact them and they are understandably pissed. This happens regularly without fail and it almost seems like I have no control over it because in my head it makes sense and it seems like the best thing for me to do. 

Some nights I’ll stay up all night dancing and filming videos of myself being goofy and I’ll talk to people and really be genuine with them. Then the next day I’ll isolate myself and be very dry in my responses to people.

I’ve wanted to see a therapist for a long time to get some help. I’ve talked to my mom a dozen times and she always says she’ll help me if I really want to. But an amount of time will go by and nothing will happen.

I guess a lot of the time I just feel like everyone else in the world is fucking insane and I’m the only normal person.

35,"Hello, so to try and keep this some what short. I have a friend who is a streamer (hopefully she doesn't see this or else it would be a bit awkward) and she suffers with depression. I'm not sure if she is dealing with anything else because I haven't asked and she also isn't very open about this.  We do not live in the same state, so I can not go see her in person even though it would be really cool.

She is a cool person, extremely nice, pretty, nice sense of humor and talented so it's not like she's walking around like the grinch y'know?  However, she often expresses that she feels very sad and isolated because 1) She does not go to school (she's 21) and 2) does not have a job which requires her to leave the house so she does not have friends that would naturally come from those two. More recently, in about the past month, her depression has been getting worse (and it's kind of easy to see on stream). She doesn't seem as excited to play which sometimes leads her to end super early and end up only streaming for a couple hours. And of course, if you've ever been on twitch, male twitch viewers don't help by being super creepy in chat either.

She has a ""problem"" where she thinks that by taking a day off of streaming for mental health is ""being a pussy"" and she's just overall worried about what her viewers are going to say and how they will react (which is reasonable). She is constantly down on herself and calls herself stupid etc and always apologizes. I always try to let her know that we love her and it's okay to take days off, we're \[viewers\] are still going to be here and so on.

For example, a tweet she just shared after ending a stream early was ""how do you stop being mean to yourself? It is getting to be a serious problem for me and I don't know how to stop""

Please remember I personally do not suffer from any mental illnesses so I can't directly relate to how she's feeling. I'd like some advice from people who do have similar issues and what they like to hear when they are feeling down and how you help yourself. 

P.S she is not suicidal or anything idk if that was going to be a concern",05Aug2019,1

To add on top, we both moved into a place two months after we met which was a very dumb idea because that's when we both brought out the worst in each other, but he was worse, he smashed my bong, ran water under my weed, and interfere with my job and friendships, whatever I didn't give him, he'd over react and then get on the defence and start name calling, I can't say I was better because once I was in the defence, I'd just do the same minus the interference... One night it got bad and he raised his fist to intimidate me so I called the cops on him. He let me use his car for work but would get petty if I did something wrong and he'd take the keys away... Nothing was good enough for him, it had to be a certain way... He said he had suspicion that I had bpd and I agreed that there might be something going on with myself and he said that's all he wanted, he wanted me to admit that which is a little fucked up, he also said he would never take responsibility for anything because he didn't want to give me that satisfaction... He'd call me a liar and accuse me of shit I didn't do... The stress got to the point where it manifested Indy a physical condition that stressed out my bladder to where I'm taking medication for it.. After all the abuse we did to each other in the four months we've been together, every time we'd end it, we'd go back to each other, like we both had some fucked up attraction to the shit we did but recently I told him I had no respect for him because I honestly didn't see anything there to respect... And since he had addiction issues, I asked him to seek help for that and he said he didn't need it but later on he did and after that he broke up with me which I'm honestly unphased by because I can get back to being myself...all he did was guilt and blame me, he continues to blame me for his drug usage and for what I did to bring it the worst in him but he still holds onto this idea that this relationship could actually work",05Aug2019,2

44,"2017 was a rough year for me. I was hospitalized 5 times, 4 of them consecutively. This also included two suicide attempts. After intensive therapy and experimental ketamine infusions, I was doing better but still having thoughts. Then I met my boyfriend and I shit you not the suicidal thoughts completely went away. This was early 2018.

I continued with therapy and taking meds but having such a long successful streak, I did decrease my dosage. I know you're not supposed to put all your will to live in one person, but that's essentially what I did. And for a while there, death actually repulsed me.

But then, last week, I was trying to sleep when my brain presented me with a real concrete suicidal thought. Rationalizing, planning, the whole nine. This kind of startled me and I sat up and was able to shake it off. But since then the persistent under current of suicidal thoughts has been ever returning. The more passive stuff like how it would be so much fucking easier if I just didnt exist. But occasionally I'll start thinking about real ways to execute it. And I remember what was so alluring about death, it sure looks easy. 

And now I'm sitting here at 130 in the morning cause I cant sleep because I was thinking of how I could leave my bf my savings so he could get out of debt, my family would get over it, and fuck wouldnt it be nice to just sleep? Just sleep and never wake up?

If any of you could spare 10 minutes on a survey that looks at intrusive thoughts, it'd be much appreciated.

Thanks Nick

\[ACADEMIC\] RESEARCH ON ATTITUDES TOWARDS INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS “REQUIRE ADULTS OVER 18YEARS OLD”

Intrusive      thoughts are unexpected and often unpleasant thoughts. They are      experienced as involuntary, and are sometimes intense, uncontrollable      and distressing. Intrusive thoughts can encompass any content that is      relevant to the person experiencing them, or the situation in which   the    person may find themselves (e.g., doubting whether you have   locked  your   car door).

Intrusive    thoughts  are  commonly experienced by the general population. They   are  also a  feature  of psychiatric conditions such as   obsessive-compulsive  disorder  (OCD),  body dysmorphic disorder (BDD),   eating disorders and   hypochondriasis.  This study aims to examine   people’s responses to   disclosure of intrusive  thoughts.

What will participation involve?

• This research involves participation in an approximately 10 to 15-minute online survey.

•      You will be asked to respond to demographic questions, and be     presented  with a short scenario describing the hypothetical disclosure     of  intrusive thoughts from someone (e.g., a friend). The scenario  may     depict a mental health condition, such as those mentioned above.  You     will then be invited to complete a short set of questions about  your     perceptions of the hypothetical person who made the  disclosure. You  will    also be asked about your mental health  knowledge and mental  health    symptoms (including OCD, anxiety and  depression), beliefs  about    yourself, and your willingness to share  distressing thoughts  and    personal information with others.

What else do I need to know?

• In order to participate, you must be 18 years or above, and speak fluent English.

•      Some questions about sensitive topics will be asked in this study.   If    you are uncomfortable with this, you may wish not to participate.

I want to find out what’s wrong with me. Could the answer be ‘nothing’? 

One moment, I’m not ok. I feel sure something’s wrong with me. I have no will to do any of my tasks, neither the energy, and I hate myself. I don’t cry. I feel detached from myself and the world. 

Then, I’m suddenly ok. Especially when I’m around my friends. I feel like I could handle my life. I enjoy my tasks. I feel like I could set aside any fear and return to my original cheery personality. There’s nothing wrong with me, I’m sure!

I'm scared to be vulnerable. I'm scared to be myself. I'm scared to talk about my problems. I rather cover it up. Cover it it with a fake smile. Cover it up with drugs.Cover it up by occupying myself with things that I'd thought would better benefit me in life such as being at work or doing homework and studying all the time. I would cover it up by trying to watch a movie or playing Xbox.

To someone on the outside, my life seems like it's perfect. Like I don't have any problems or stress. Like I have a supportive family who wants the best for me. ( Even though they are but also toxic at the same time)

I rather that act like I'm okay. The thought of pretending to be okay when I'm not sounds soothing because I don't know how to deal with my problems in an effective way. I don't know how to not be okay. I'll rather cover it up and pretend that I'm fine.

I've honestly tried to deal with the my problems but I always resort to covering them up because I can't come to any conclusions or closure with my issues and things end up getting worse worse, so I figure why not just pretend to be okay.

55,"Hi I hope it's okay if I'm not talking about myself. This is just concerning me a lot and I want other peoples' opinions on it. 

My younger cousin has never acted quite normal. she has always had problems with boundaries and her temper and she is highly manipulative. it wasn't a huge problem until she hit around age 12-13 when she began to go off the deep end. She started running away frequently. She would curse at and physically attack her parents. She called my grandma a bitch. There was a story where she was in the car with her mom and she was kicking the seat and screaming the whole time then started playing some song about a mom whose daughter hung herself (which happened to her mom with her first daughter).
 
I believe there may be a genetic aspect. i only have severe mental illness running on one side of my family (the one she's on) while my cousin has it on both sides. her dad is in prison for abusing them and her dad's brother was a literal serial killer. 

so my aunt tried desperately to find some kind of mental health facility that would keep her. she exhausted all of her insurance money and her money (and borrowed money from my grandparents). every place they put her in ended up kicking her out. it was a cycle where she'd arrive at a new place and act like a sweetheart and we'd all think she was finally improving then someone would tell her to do something she didn't want to do and she'd flip out and become aggressive.

eventually my aunt had to give up custody of her to the state so that they'd continue to pay to keep her in these places. but so far nobody has been willing to keep her there for longer than a month or two. i believe she has now been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and oppositional defiant disorder and she has gone on and off of some kind if antipsychotic medication.

i think my family is all hoping that this will be something she'll grow out of. she got kicked out of her most recent foster home because she physically attacked one of the lady's daughters. i've been told that they're getting to the point where it looks like juvie is the only option left. i'm just scared that she's destined for prison. she has shown no desire to get better or start behaving and in the US we don't have very good mental healthcare which i've seen clearly from my aunt's struggles to find somewhere that will treat her long term. I'm just wondering if y'all think there's still hope for her, i really want to see her get better but i'm slowly losing hope. :(",05Aug2019,1

58,"
15 year old male. And over the past few years my mental state has been pretty bad. And it was probably because of my parents.
Examples of this would be, my dad punching a wall and leaving a small hole because I got a D in school. 
All of the times I went to bed crying.
My mom made fun of my appearance a lot. When I had long hair, my mom told me I looked like a hobo and a girl. Also whenever I don't brush my teeth for one day, my mom tells me I have rotten teeth and that I'm goong to get cavities because I missed one day. She also constantly mocks me for having ""buck teeth"" and it makes me insecure about teeth actually.

My mom is a racist even to her own son and keeps calling me black boy (I'm mixed) and other what I presume to be racial slurs. 

My mom and dad hate each other, and literally won't talk to each other and make me have them send messages. My mom would also constantly hit my dad, (this was when I was like 11 they barely interact anymore.)

I have social anxiety, and a fear of speaking, probably from being yelled at if I ever raised my voice at my parents.

My mom is racist against any other race that isn't hers, (she is Filipino) and has used multiple racial slurs against white, spanish and black people all the time.

My dad never tried to stop my mom whenever she yells at me, he always yelled at me to be quiet. I've also veen forced for many years for give mothers day cards and birthday gifts, because my dad says ""its your mother no matter what and you need to respect her because she is your mother""

My mom also pinched me whenever I cried as a kid and in her own recollection of whenever she talks about how discipline kids she would say how people used to look at her like she was crazy whenever she would pinch me whenever I cried. She believes the ""It's my kid and I can discipline my kid however I want""

When I was 13 my mom sent me to bed crying.

There have been at least 3 times in the past wgere my dad yelled at me for ""being stupid"" or getting bad grades.
We were driving home from school and he was trying to turn on the road and I told him ""just go"" and he started yelling at me the whole ride back about how stupid I am and asking me if I wanted to die if he wasn't careful and we'd get in an accident.


Theyve always given me stuff that I wanted, and cooked and cleaned like any other parents but is this necessarily a situation that's so bad I need to get out? 

Also do I have some sort of trauma because everytime I even think about those times I want to cry.

Sorry if this post is a mess I just need to get my thought out there.",05Aug2019,2

I probably spend 5-10 hours on my phone/computer/xbox and I stay up until like 3 am every night and wake up at like 12 and I just hate myself for being like this. I never get much sleep anyways and during the school year its even worse.

My life has been very traumatic, lonely, sad, hopeless, and pitiful. When people ask, ""what's your happiest memory?"" I can't tell them I went to the beach and had lobster, or my best friend threw me a party, or that I got a puppy for Christmas. My happiest memory is a tie between buying my own first car at 18 and all the times I've walked my dog.

64,"There are a lot of resources and studies that have demonstrated the power of journaling and the benefits it can have specially for those struggling with mental issues as depression or anxiety.

Though journaling might seem simple and straight forward, when you stare at the blank piece of paper you might start to feel like you don't know where to start or what to focus on.

That's why I have found that having a guided journaling experience is of great help so I wanted to share with you 10 writing promts that can help you focus and explore on your thoughts and emotions.

So - if you want to start a new journal entry today, here are 10 things you can think about:

1. **Write down your biggest challenges you are facing right now.**
2. **Last time I faced a problem in my life, I… (write down how you really did had the power to change your circumstances)**
3. **Recall a time or situation when you helped someone. How did you feel?**
4. **What keeps you moving when things seem tough?**
5. **Three of my best qualities are…**
6. **Write about your achievements this week/month.**
7. **One of my favorite memories is...**
8. **What is your patience level with others on a scale of 1-10? Why? How can you improve it?**
9. **How can today become better?**
10. **3 things you are gratefull for**

I really do hope you'll take the time to look over this promts and start thingking about it and please do let me know how did it go for you.

It takes me half an hour of checking my alarm to sleep and it takes me a good half hour or so to be satisfied im leaving my house in a safe state.

To me depression operates through being, or training to beat yourself up. You try to combat isolation and the ensuing sadness by constantly feeding the void through creativity.

Depression for me, is not feeling in control of your own destiny. You consequently feel empty all the time. This is the societal cause. Strange as it may seem, we can try to improve society, so others don't begin to suffer from it AND try and get out of it through our own individual efforts.

Don't try and analyse why you are feeling the way you do. You won't know until you you are out of the depression trust me, there are more connections in the human brain than atoms in the observable universe. The human brain is not entirely rational in basis, because the universe is not entirely rational. If God had a plan, in an infinite universe, blind chance can fuck it up.

It's most important to find solutions to the world's problems that satisfy you on a psychological level than an intuitive level. 

Debating ideas is more important than having friends, if only for promoting your own self-worth. I'm sorry I can't expand on this right-now.

Don't embrace humility. It's really bad for your mental health. Trust your psychology, even if it can't be rationally explained. 

Recognise that Using language isn't some froth on top of REAL experience, but 

Satisfying your own psychology is more important than

Practice compassionate mind. Be moral, but try to only be moral so you can learn how to solve society's problems as practice for solving your own. Society can be objectively studied, your brain's workings can't. If persuading people isn't expressing your personality, only do it to develop your own morality.

Eventually, immerse yourself in great art and embrace it rather than music which is catchy, trashy, or frothy. Great art is compelling, engaging or fire inducing. Great art is what you find beautiful on a moral and intellectual level, rather than that music which has beauty within it.

Embrace the rhetoric device of triplets, even if it's frothy.

Constantly move Forward, and don't let others compromise your vision. If you have a thought, express it.

I struggled with depression and suicide before in the past and was sent to hospital for attempts a few times but got over it for a bout a year but having those issues and what not has cause me to become anxious and paranoid about everything and everything and its been a toll and ive noticed recently that my depression has made its way back and suicidal thoughts a long with it also but tonight its been quite bad. im not so much worried that im gonna do anything to my self tonight because i dont think I will im more so worried that im not gonna get out of this even if im good for a bout a year a know all this is gonna come back. I think a lot to do with it recently has been loneliness not so much in a relationship like gf/bf more so friendship and just human interaction in general which is weird because about 2 years ago i used to be a fairly popular guy and always had friends to talk to and hang out with but these days all i do is sleep and play games and whatever about a year ago I was fine with this because i had online friends but not anymore I have no one, no one messages me, no one talks to me or asks me to play games or anything. Im just always the one asking and its gotten to the point where the only interaction i have with people is with family and thats quite little as it is. dont get me wrong my family are amazing people and i dont think its there fault at all but idk. Im just kinda ranting all this bs that probs doesnt matter but whatever. idek why im really posting this idk if its a cry for help or whether i just want some interaction or what but idk. I guess im just depressed and idk what to do im back in this pit that I once was in years ago and i cant get out like i just feel like a loser and its not gonna get better. 

feel free to add any input you want im just blabbing on and dont really know what im saying anyway",05Aug2019,4

90,"My cousin Is all I have. He's always had, what I assumed to be, a fake ""crazy guy"" aesthetic. It's what helped him cope with being an overweight child in a cruel school. Over the past few years he's made jokes and placed hypothetical questions about weather or not this is the real world, or if I was real or some kind of imaginary friend. I always thought he was kidding. Once he placed a hypothetical about a time he had a really bad trip on lsd, and he wondered if he had died that day and this was some kind of hell. Again, I never took him seriously. Then a few nights ago he asked my roommate if I was really in the room with him. I brushed it off as a joke, but when my roommate left he told me in all seriousness that he was having paranoid thoughts about what was real or not and asked me not to play any tricks or anything on him for a while. 

I'm really scared. He's been my only friend for as long as I can remember. I'm not sure if I can handle him slipping away. I've seen so much horrible shit, and he's always kept me grounded and made me feel safe. Now i guess he doesn't even know if I'm real.

91,"Hey everyone I’ve been dealing with , what I think, is depersonalization and de-realization disorder. It started about a month ago and got worse and worse. Right now I feel it’s at its worst. Everything seems like a dream and everything seems very foggy. 

It’s hard to focus on tasks, and the worst is sometimes I’ll realize my surroundings and what’s going on and will begin to have a panic attack. I’ve always had bad anxiety and calm myself down but the feeling of depersonalization does not leave. I hate feeling this way and I want to ask what I should do to reduce this feeling? 

I have a doctors appointment soon and will bring this up to my physician, however I wanted to ask if there were any other ways to calm myself down or reduce the feeling of depersonalization (like meditation or doing certain physical activities). I’m relatively a very healthy person: I eat clean , workout 5 times a week, drink lots of water, no excessive amounts of junk food or soda. I really do need some help and would greatly appreciate any advice, I’m very desperate.",05Aug2019,4

Why am I normalised, why am I seen as ok cause I smile, why do people assume the feelings I display have any truth to them. I’m exhausted of getting up in the morning and acting like I’m ok, like I don’t know. My head is a cloudy mess I can’t control there’s just constant noise, no stop, not once. Chatter and a low buzz.

“you’re not good enough” 
“Why try to change” 
“you’re just gonna do what you always do give up”
“Die”
“Nobody will ever love you”
“Just stop trying” 
“There lives would be better without you”

Sometimes specific when I know it cuts deep. The support I have is endless but I’d rather cry to my pillow at 3am while hurting myself. I try to be perfect to other people cause after ten years of you having a mental illness other people get sick of it. Ten years and other people are sick of it. I’m exhausted. When does it end for me what do they want to see to believe me a broken mess screaming they want to kill themselves, crying, tearing at there skin, bruises, cuts, bones protruding from my skin and emergency room visits. It’s been a silent few years from the support end.

“Try smiling”

I make other feel ok by saying “I’m better now” when all I wanna do is scream at the top of my lungs. But a lot of “I’m better” and “I’m fine” has made the truth an unspeakable limit for me. The breakdowns, the crying, the scars, the dissociating, the crippling anxiety, the mood swings, the distractions, the lack of motivation, the shaking hands and low eyes have never been enough.

93,"To make a long story short, my first job was a full-time position in an office. Lovely working environment, nothing wrong with it, but I was severely depressed and struggled to cope with the nine-to-five structure and amount of hours. I would have weekly panic attacks when my alarm went off in the morning, and I didn't understand why. It made me feel like a failure for not being able to handle it. In the end, it led me to try hard drugs and I had a mental breakdown. I stopped working there months later because my contract came to an end.

I ended up not having a job for a while after that (but did begin volunteering on and off) and my mental health deteriorated even more, leading to multiple other mental breakdowns. I won't go into detail but suicide attempts were made, fortunately not too severe ones. I think in the moment, they were maybe more of a cry for help... but in the moment, I also did desperately want to die. Even after learning all of this about me, and having had depression herself, my mother's sympathy was limited and I didn't really feel like I could talk to her. I went to therapy, but it was limited to six sessions. They were free sessions which is why they were limited -- I couldn't afford the paid ones and my mother wasn't willing to pay for them. I wasn't given any more than six because at the time, I had no immediate plans of suicide.

I've volunteered at two organisations for years now and last year, I finally got into paid part-time work again last year. It was a terrible job, to put it lightly. My boss was awful and didn't really know how to talk to people, there were no health and safety regulations, and it was cash-in-hand. And apart from anything else, I never had anything to do. I have ADHD and my attention wavers easily, so having absolutely nothing to do but pace around for hours on end was difficult (it was just me alone, no co-workers, only ever one person on at a time). I felt more stressed about money at that job than I did when I wasn't working. I, again, had panic attacks in the mornings and once at work but it was much less frequent than at my previous full-time job. The branch I worked in closed down this year so I lost that job but I wasn't overly sad to see it go. 

However, since then, I've struggled to find work again. I'm seeing a new therapist, again for only limited sessions, but both she and my work advisor feel that part-time would be best for me right now. I'm a bit fearful to plunge myself back into full-time right away in case it gives me panic attacks and makes my depression worse. So basically myself and two professionals are in agreement that part-time is the best way to go to make sure I'm comfortable again. I'm trying to get into the field I'm trained in (office work) as I think that's where I'd be most comfortable, but I am trying to get into other areas too. I desperately want a job so I can save up for a flat deposit and move out, and just to have a sense of purpose again. It's proving difficult for a number of reasons but I am trying. There's been more part-time positions in places close to me and easy for me to travel to opening up so I'm really hoping to get a call back from one of them soon. 

But my mother keeps pressuring me, now with input from my grandmother, as does my father (my parents are separated). Saying it's about time I had a job again, I need to be in full-time work right now, sending me dozens of applications for full-time work, etc. It's making me feel worthless and like I'm failing because I'm not living the life they want to see me living. I feel deeply hurt that my mother in particular, who knows everything about how I've been struggling the past few years and has only ever worked part-time in her entire life, has been acting like I don't want a job or that I'm not trying to get one when she knows that I am. And knows that I'm primarily looking for part-time right now. 

I think I'm just starting to feel like I'm in the wrong for wanting part-time work only for the moment. Is there something wrong with that? I thought I was protecting my mental health and doing the right thing for myself but I'm starting to doubt that. I thought I was being sensible choosing to do part-time only for a while and then hopefully build up to full-time or at least more part-time hours at a later date, but my family seems to think it's... weak? Pointless? So I suppose I want some outside perspective. I didn't want to talk to my friends or boyfriend about it because I feel worthless not having found a job yet.

TL;DR Had a mental breakdown working full-time in my first job, and had very poor mental health afterwards. Found work again but that position ended. Have since been seeking part-time work only as I felt it was best for my mental health, as agreed upon by my work advisor and therapist, but my family are pressuring me for full-time work. I feel useless and am doubting my decision to only work part-time.",05Aug2019,8

95,"[22F] I have add/adhd and use to take vyvanse in high school. Good experience overall. One thing that came up was when I shiver/get chills, I twitch and sort of sniff at the same time. I didn't really notice it until other people did. Theyd ask if I had tourette's, no I do not. But now this had come to my attention. So the next appointment I had, I told my doctor at the time (gr8 lady) and she asked if it was getting in the way of everyday life or socializing. It didn't bother me too much and she said to let her know if that changes, stating that with these sort of medications, picking up tics weren't unheard of. And it wasnt something to stress over as long as it wasnt bothering me. 
So that was around 17/18. I'm 22. I still do the shiver/sniff thing. People still react the same way. It's only bothered me a little bit socially but still not that bad.

I consider myself emotional, anxious, and sensitive in general, but lately in the past few months especially i have been feeling a rise in how easily upset I can feel. I feel things really hard in my heart and it’s like this weight of panic and fear sometimes for no reason at all. Just like a train of thought in my head that tells me i need to feel anxious. It’s taken a serious toll on my now finished relationship as well as my mood and energy levels. I feel so drained every day from all of my feelings, overthinking, and anxiousness that I really can’t bring myself to do much. I’ve never seen a doctor or anyone about this because I am on my father’s health insurance and he doesn’t believe therapy or anything of the sort actually can help someone.

97,"are so hard! Rant ahead.  
  
I am older than my partner by three years (we got together early and hastily), in a different stage of life, including as concerns mental health, and we are just very different in general. I think he is really special and I love him, but our relationship is definitely not ""nourishing"" us.  
  
He and I both struggle with anxiety and depression. I now understand that, combined with a belated formative stage in life and some other factors such as emotionally unintelligent parents, his is more severe. Also more social anxiety than (for me) generalized anxiety.  
  
Like any couple, it's not our only incompatibility. I run hot (temper-wise), he considers visible vulnerability or negativity (e.g. anxiety, anger, overt disappointment, confrontation) a big sin and therefore projects it onto others, which is easy to do to me because I'm already very expressive. I'm very verbal, he's not so much, I have a motormouth, he has an overactive mental filter and seems not to be able to recognize and appreciate and express his own thoughts/feelings. But the biggest kicker is the mental health thing.  
  
Because I have already spent 8 years or so battling those problems, and I developed them in my own context, and probably owing to some accidental order in which I tried different things and went through different life shit, I am having a bit of a breakthrough before one seems on the horizon for him. He is trying to graduate university and differentiate from his parents and build some basis for intimacy with me, and (especially for a depressed person) that's so much at once.  
  
By contrast, I'm (gratefully!) past some of that stuff and not putting out fires in my life anymore. I'm enjoying my solitude, my work, my home life, my hygiene routine, my self-organization habits and tools, my friends, the cycles of the months and weeks, and my husband even though he is clearly not getting as much out of it all.  
  
Even though I know that, I get frustrated and resentful with him sometimes. I feel like he's not trying hard enough. I know how much depressed people get told that and tell themselves that and how unhelpful that is, so I don't say it. But he does nothing. He tried medicating (2 different SSRIs at different times for anxiety and depression and Adderall, Vyvanse, and Dexedrine for ADHD) and that didn't work, he tried CBT and the results were mixed, he tried naturopathy with one naturopath, and the results were minimal. He has a bunch of health issues that aren't simple to treat.  
  
So for almost a year he's really done nothing for himself, his quality of life, his happiness, me, our relationship, or his future regardless of what it involves. He has a videogame addiction that he seems to have substituted or significantly offloaded from a porn addiction. He is always down on himself - not out loud, but once in a while he reveals that he always experiences that. His fears and insecurities manifest in reality, as anyone who has dealt with this knows is bound to happen. I have tried different ways to support him, comfort him, or inspire him, but the only sustainable change is probably to be what I want to be, so that he sees that he can be whoever he wants to be. Which I'm doing. I work out 5x a week, give it my all at work, use positive self-talk, journal like a machine, overcome fears to continue to be an active friend and partner, etc etc all this stuff that seemed impossible when I was 23. I'm not a perfect partner. But I feel limited in my development in that area by his current inertia.  
  
It also hurts that he doesn't celebrate my growth or even just day-to-day happiness with me. I feel like it would spill over to him because I'd feel so good and validated, so I'd feel no restraints from pouring out my love back to him! I know he knows this, deep down. I know this isn't ""about"" me (although I don't think that's a thing in close relationships though btw, I think everything's about both people, and not necessarily in a pressure or ""obligation"" kind of way). I know it's hard to celebrate someone else when you are busy hating yourself. But it still feels lonely. I guess my only two real qualms with our relationship are:  
(1) would he stand a better chance of overcoming this stuff and finding himself if we broke up? My gut feeling, his claims, and the therapist's reassurances are all abstract - what would happen if it was tested in real life is concrete.  
(2) how long can I be lonely in this relationship, even with all of the less profound Joy's we do share, before it threatens all these mental health gains I've bled/sweated/teared for? I know none of you can answer this for me.  
  
We have gone to couples' counseling and our therapist considers him an enigma who must be deeply repressed as a result of the parenting thing. She thinks he holds many secrets from everyone, maybe including himself. She also thinks I have much better self-discipline, am harder-working, and am an ""A+ student"" (not since middle school but thanks girl!) - she thinks part of that is just age, and he's bound to grow out of some of his current inhibitions soonish.  
  
I think all of that is true. But I also think he just needs to get in touch with his feelings and desires and challenge himself, a LITTLE bit, every single day, and it will help him assert his own identity, and that can ultimately only be good for everyone. But all our mental health/self-discovery journeys are ultimately our own. No matter how hard I try, I may not end up being the most key person in his recovery/next stage of personal development, and I accept that. All I can do is my best. One last vent: I really don't want to not be there for him when that day comes, because I could have really used him here when it came for me.",05Aug2019,1

I thought I would just text him on my phone, but realized my phone was dying. I got up because I wanted to continue talking to my husband, but had to go to the computer to do it. Even though he wasn't there in person, my husband gave me a reason to get up and start my day.",05Aug2019,2
99,"The platitudes, I'm sure most of us with mental health issues have heard them. At nearly 40 years old, I've shifted from nodding and smiling and moving on to actually being quite upset when they are shoved down my throat. When talking in various support communities for addiction, etc., and explaining the things I go through/mindset that I struggle with being met with constant trite and avoidance/invalidation from others it really hurts.

I totally get that I'm the broken one here and likely normal folks just can't fathom/understand but at least be sympathetic and kind. If someone has been suffering for a very long time and has tried most all avenues available to them to get better but is still struggling badly, and you're aware of this history - I personally can't understand just being dismissive to that person. I can't understand being dismissive to a person just suffering, regardless of length of time, etc. Sure, offer potential other avenues of support if said individual is not aware, etc. Many people find help from what I've seen/read by some of the available options.

Along the way I've encountered others with situations and troubles that I really could not understand or empathize with, but based on their stories and discussions I see the pain and suffering. Though I may not be able to directly offer help in a truly tangible fashion, I will always be supportive in any way I can. I let them rant or vent, lend an ear and let them know I am here and I care. I validate them and their feelings. I am not going to cut them off, abandon them and leave them out in the cold so to speak.

I'm so hurt by people I trusted and made myself vulnerable to, only to be turned away (putting it mildly). Literally crying as I write this. I just needed to get it out. Please, if you encounter someone who is struggling in their life, especially if you are in a group specifically tailored for supporting and helping others - don't dismiss and invalidate them.",05Aug2019,5

Im a 22 years male in a conservative country. i havent had a girlfriend . i have never ask anybody .

I used to think this is mostly about my fear of rejection and lack of self confidance because i'm a short guy(165 5'2).              
 I never got bullied about being short . but i'm really insecaure about it.

At my teens(13-18) while my friends always talked about girls and i was never really into it but being gay didnt even cross my mind at that time so i always thought i'm straight but just a loser who cant get a girlfriend.

After a while i found my self looking into guys in porn . First i thought it's a nothing important and it's  just a thing that will go away after a while but i didnt. I started checking out guys irl and searching especailly for hot man while waching porn. 

After that i finally realised that i might be gay but there is one thing that boggles me about it. If i suck at one thing or realised that if  i'm not good at something i just quit it and always use most comfortable way.

 Then i reailsed i might not be gay and my mind choose to be gay rather than the be a straight  loser because in my teens   
 i never tought of being gay. I havent meet anyone gay to ask but i think they always know that they are gay.

I'm caught in the middle and cant decide wheter i'm gay or my mind just playing games. It's really hard for me to figure out and i'm starting to think about it all the time and i cant talk about it with anyone so creating this post may help me

I’ve been meaning to ask my parents for some sort of help for a while now, because of how freaked out I get about just talking to other people and the circles I run in my head to convince myself my friends hate me. And last night, my dad suggested we go to a cognitive behavioral  therapist to deal with what he thinks might be social anxiety. (Of course I don’t want to self-diagnose, and I’m not sure if it’s actually severe enough to be characterized as anxiety.)

So, I’m just worried about what therapy is gonna be like. I mean, I know that you talk to a psychologist about what’s bothering you, but... how does that help? Do I just talk about my feelings for an hour? Telling someone about it isn’t going to magically make me not worry about anything, right? Also, talking to people is the problem. I always think that people find me obnoxious and I should just shut up because nobody wants to hear what I have to say anyway, so how am I going to talk exclusively about me for almost an hour at a time?

105,"Obligatory on mobile and I'll do the best I can with formatting.

Okay, maybe this isn't so unusual?

I've known this for a while now but I'm trying to make sense of it, I suppose. In short, I don't have any kind of emotional empathy for other people. I can logically understand emotions in others but I don't feel anything. Actually, it even makes me feel kind of awkward when people complain/confide in me and I don't have any kind of emotional response or know what to say.

I've been to funerals of family that have been there my entire life and felt nothing. People experience loss around me and I don't have anything to say to comfort them. My husband has talked to me about taking precautions and naming our child as a beneficiary and I have thoughts like ""am I going to have to pretend to be falling apart if there was a funeral?"" because I feel like otherwise it would look like I don't care. At our wedding, he was teary eyed and I kind of faked it so as not to appear heartless? Even when our child was born I didn't cry or anything like that (maybe some tears from pain but even then I don't think so). 

Growing up my mom would (and still does) cry over every tiny thing. Any movie or book or sob story makes her bleeding heart ache. I always thought this was some kind of ploy to win people over because I just couldn't believe someone could be such a cry baby. I know this sounds really mean but I think it just became annoying at some point. 

Even before I noticed that trait in her I always considered myself less emotional than people in general? As a child I was more tomboy or even masculine in some ways and was not a cryer or fussy like my female peers. I always thought of it as ""not being a little bitch."" 

As a kid I moved a lot and always had to find new groups of friends, so I have very few lifelong friends and in a way I wonder if I never learned how to connect or care about others. Or form meaningful relationships because I don't have any with my family either. I saw a few family members recently and all I noticed was that I feel exactly the same relationship/interaction with them as I do with my ""friends"" and that I have 0 connection to the emotional stimuli that relates us (I casually referred to his siblings funeral as if I were talking about a pot luck we went to; I didn't even notice until hours later that he was bothered and I felt nothing).

Now none of this is to say I don't have emotions. I do get depressed and have even been Baker Acted/5150-ed multiple times for both actual suicide attempts and perceived suicidal ideation. I am uncomfortably familiar with anger, isolation and loneliness.  I have been diagnosed with bipolar 1 or 2 (different diagnoses at different times, which doesn't really make sense but it is what it is). I've suspected borderline, narcassism, psychopathy, sociopathy, depersonalization, derealization, trauma/PTSD or just plain being broken at different times due to different ""symptoms"". 

I know self diagnosis holds no weight and it's so easy to point to a few symptoms and say ""aha, that's me"". Beyond that diagnoses are just labels anyway. I guess I'm just wondering if this is within the realm of ""normal""? Am I just a loner? Am I an asshole, although I don't typically feel malice towards others unless circumstances cause me to feel that way, it's just not default.

I have meditated and I hasn't changed anything except it made me more aware of this trait in myself rather than inspire any kind of compassion. Cannabis also has an interesting effect on me. I go through this cycle of getting quiet and introspective where I notice how detached I am from everyone and everything, then I have a brief period of feeling perfectly okay with this detachment, then I fall into a weird depression about being so detached and I just want to be alone. Because of how it's been affecting me, I have it very rarely.

It feels like in general I just have 0 interest in people and want to be alone, and because that's unrealistic I have to fake interest and empathy for others and their lives, and I don't have much faith in my acting ability so I get insecure that people aren't buying it. This causes me to pull back further.  Again, I'm not malicious or hostile. I'm not mean. I'm a generally polite and neutral person. I just don't actually care.

I feel like I've gone in a rambling circle and maybe I've only posted on here because I don't have anyone to talk to about this.",05Aug2019,1
106,"When I was 13 (around the early 2000s) my parents got worried as I was making the transition from elementary school to middle school. They had me see a psychiatrist who did no testing or talking with me before writing me a prescription for some SSRIs. The dosage was very high and my parents weren't told to taper me on or off. 


I had intense sleepiness, trouble caring about things, trouble remembering my friends' names. I slept so deeply that I didn't even wake up to my body's signals to use the bathroom; I was a teenaged boy pissing his own bed. My grades plummeted and that made my parents simply insist on higher doses. The psychiatrist I was seeing wrote those prescriptions too, still never looked me in the eye. 


I knew something was wrong, but it was months before I could focus enough to tell my parents. Luckily they listened and I never had to take those pills again. But for the next 18 years I went through life blaming myself for not adjusting to a new school quickly enough or well enough. When I was old enough to make my own appointments, I spent hours and hours (and hundreds of dollars) getting evaluated for every possible mental illness. I even had blood tests. All the tests came back saying I was normal and healthy, but it still tugged at me. 


A few weeks ago I found the courage to find that psychiatrist and then I wrote him a letter asking for an apology. I was respectful, stating the facts of the matter first and then moving on to how it made me feel in the years afterward. I was clear that I only wanted an apology, but didn't want to smear his reputation or harm him. I told him that he could reply or he could not, and if he didn't reply I wouldn't bother him further. 


Today he found me via Facebook and apologized. The relief and the confirmation I felt was nearly overwhelming.

Some people who I used enjoy to have around don’t matter one bit to me anymore and I feel like they could die and I wouldn’t care. I don’t have any type of willpower to keep living because I don’t care about anything or anyone. I don’t have any hobbies besides playing video games and drawing, and I’m horrible at those two. Nothing interests me and I’m just so unhappy with life. I don’t know how I can get a therapist without explaining these problems to my parents.

110,"I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety two years ago and have been in treatment for it since and thankfully im getting better, but over the last half year ive start feeling extremely depressed and have urges to hurt myself violently whenever im pmsing/am on my period to a degree where once a month i can hardly do anything because i have to focus on not hurting myself. I've been on birth control in the past but it only made me feel even more sad and useless and i really dont want to take any more medicine because I already feel pretty affected by the medicine im currently taking. Does anyone have the same experience and how do you deal with it?",05Aug2019,1
111,"Apologies for the length and poor formatting. 

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 8 years.  We met at 18 years old in university and have been inseparable ever since. We’ve been through so much together and I just know he’s my person. He has the biggest heart and would do anything for me. My family adores him and my friends always say how lucky I am.

About 2 years in, he confided in me that he often hears voices and sometimes sees a specific demon in the room. We went to the doctor and they gave him an anti psychotic. In 2017, I found a suicide note written to me while he was at work. I took him to emergency and he was admitted to the inpatient mental health ward for 4 weeks. He was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and major psychotic episodes. He also received treatment for marijuana and alcohol abuse. Once released, things seem to improve and we just hit his 2 year anniversary of being in the hospital. He has had his slip ups (this past Christmas he stopped taking his meds and got very drunk at a bar on Christmas night, he’s had a few drunken nights in the past year that result in fights) but I never expected his progress to be linear and knew there would be set backs. 

Fast forward to July 2019, four weeks ago, we had a big party for my boyfriend’s birthday where he insisted on inviting all of our friends and family, including aunts and uncles. During the party, my boyfriend proposed in front of everyone and I happily said yes. My friends brought out balloons, engagement decorations, and caught the whole thing on film. It was easily the best day of my life. 

This past Saturday, he attended a bachelor party. We are in couples therapy to work on building trust and improving our sex life. Several times before the bachelor party we discussed how this was a big opportunity for us to build trust and he said he was going to show me how much things had changed. Newly engaged, I told him I was terrified of being hurt but he seemed to really get it. Saturday night I fell asleep researching wedding venues, Sunday morning I woke up to find out he was missing and had been doing cocaine, drinking, and texting escorts all night. I immediately called off the engagement and I was absolutely devastated. This was not the guy I knew and I couldn’t make any sense of it.

Several days later, he came to pick up his things and I could tell he wasn’t well. I asked to look through his phone because I was suspicious he met up with an escort. While going through his banking, I saw he’s been at the beer store almost every day for the past 4 weeks. Bills had bounced and he didn’t have his part of rent money. I checked his browser history and he had googled earlier that day how to use carbon monoxide to commit suicide. When I confronted him, he broke down in tears and admitted to throwing out his meds 3 weeks ago and drinking every day. He said the voices were back, he felt out of control, and he just wanted to end his life to escape it all. Of course I immediately took him to the hospital and he’s been admitted again, until at least August 14. He went through serious withdrawals from the alcohol and is continuing to have psychotic episodes. I’ve begun to find out more information about the drinking behind my back, suicide attempts I was unaware of, etc.

I’m really struggling with setting boundaries. I still feel absolutely crushed by what he did to me and I’m not sure I’ll ever get over it. But I do love him and want to support him. I know he’s very unwell and I don’t want him to feel alone. I took the last two days off from going to the hospital or talking to him but I can tell it’s making him very depressed. When I called this morning the first thing he asked was “are you coming to visit today” I guess I’m hoping someone has any words of wisdom to get me through this, any suggestions for how to set boundaries where I can still take the time I need but also support him, or how decide if it’s time to leave him. Right now, I haven’t made any decisions about where we stand. I can’t imagine my life with anyone else but I also can’t imagine how I’ll ever get over the lies and betrayal.

I spent most of today crying and screaming into my pillow because I think it’s finally hit me how torn I feel. Please help.

TLDR: boyfriend of 8 years is great but has previously been hospitalized for mental health and substance use. He proposed July 6 and on July 27 went on a bender doing cocaine and partying with escorts. He’s now been hospitalized for psychosis. Advice?",05Aug2019,1
112,"I know quite a dumb question but lemme explain - how can I define success in my life if not by comparing it to some kinda yardstick? Aren’t the motivations of the majority of people who want money and status in careers a lot to do with feeling like they’ve made it in life because they are successful relative to their peers? 

I think I’m quite a jealous person and I don’t know how to stop because I feel like my life loses meaning if I don’t compare myself and try to win against others. I look at people who never get jealous at all and can’t help but think they must be a little full of themselves. This is probs wrong I know like it’s bad to be jealous but I think I get jealous cos I have a knack for seeing the good traits in others so if people never feel even a twinge of jealousy, I think to when I’ve felt like that and it’s been because in my eyes, they had nothing I wanted and would be jealous of and so I felt superior. Do you think everyone feels a little jealous at some point? What do I do about this jealousy? How do I feel meaning in life without comparison?",05Aug2019,2
113,I've always had a bad case of social anxiety. I've had depression for long periods of time too. It comes and goes. I've also started going to school abroad too. I've gone to cbt sessions and they've been helpful. I've been feeling better lately in terms of challenging my anxiety fuelled thoughts by starting to think more logically about my problems and starting to think from other people's point of view. My doctor prescribed me prozac. He said take it for a year while you're abroad. He also said you don't need to change anything. You'll feel like a different person in a month. I have a very hard time believing this for obvious reasons. I don't know if i should keep taking my beta blocker or give antidepressants a go.

A year or so back I was hearing weird noises like people laughing, duck noises, and parts of conversations that didn't exist. I was worried then but after a couple months the noises stopped. Now I'm dealing with this. Should I be concerned? Ive been diagnosed with a few mental illnesses in the past by different doctors including bpd, depression? gen. anxiety, manic depressive bipolar, and panic disorder. My most recent diagnosis is still in determination between ptsd and bpd. My therapist is not very determined to figure out which she feels is most fitting because I'm not medicated and I don't plan on being medicated. I've moved 4 times and had 4 different doctors my doctor in the hospital I went to changed it as well so I'm lost as to what's actually going on with me anymore. I know people see things out of the corners of their eyes sometimes, I guess I'm just scared. My family believes my dad is a paranoid schizophrenic and idk if its genetic or not.

Little background about myself, I've always had depression, as long as I can remember and have stayed in an institute for it in my late teens. Dad left before I was born and I contacted him once in desperation for help due to my bad home life and he gave me £250 and told me not to contact him again, I was 16 and sleeping rough, granted my mother and I didn't get on, but I also wasn't easy to get on with on a emotional level.

&amp;#x200B;

I made a big move and left my hometown when I was 21 and left a much young sister behind, but I had to move away, it was that or go insane. I managed to get through the next 4 or so years happy, I had a lot of fun and met a lot of people and was rather outgoing etc, but one problem was my career path, it wasn't bad like but I wasn't happy going to work and I decided to pursue something else and I went to university which involved me moving somewhere else, again. So I done what was needed and I moved to the 2nd city and done my foundation year and moved back. Before I moved I met this girl and we are thankfully still together now, she is everything to me and keeps me alive.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have just failed my second year, I am in the worst financial situation i've ever been in and I am unable to find a job, no matter what I do. I've always had big dreams and goals and this is killing me, I  feel like the biggest failure to so many people, I feel like i've failed my younger sister as I cannot afford to go and see her, I feel like i've failed my girlfriend as I promised her so much and I also most importantly I feel like i've failed myself. I have no drive or ambition any more and I feel like it's never going to end, what I want most is to be able to pull myself out this and find a way to fix everything like i've been able to before in my life, I used to be so strong and I used to feel like I could make it happen if I really wanted to, Now I just want it all to end.

120,"Today is a bad day so I just need to vent. I've struggled with bouts of depression/anxiety for a long time. It was especially bad a couple of years ago when some bad family shit was going on. I thought I was doing better but I feel almost as bad as ever the last couple of months. Nothing in my life is how I want it to be. My job is stressful and doesn't pay enough for me to have any kind of life but the bare minimum. I'm female, 30ish with no partner currently. I hate where I live. I push my friends away and argue with family. I'm terrible at relationships (and even friendships). I have insane trust issues and don't let people emotionally close. I know I'm starting to annoy family and even colleagues with my attitude. Sometimes I can barely keep my shit together at work now and I'm quiet, sad and irritable and it makes me feel whiny and attention seeking. I miss the person I can be when I don't feel like this.

I want to do so much, but I've no money and zero motivation to change my circumstances. I feel lost and empty every single day. Mostly I don't want to be dead, I want to be alive. But I'm trapped in between.

The better days are the worst because they convince me everything is sort of ok even though its not and I keep plodding on as a semi functional deeply unhappy adult.

I'm scared of therapy and I'm scared of drugs, but I don't think I can put off doing something about this.

I'm also endlessly angry. Like so many things make me feel pure rage inside. The real root of all this is probably my dad. He went to prison when I was little for abusing a much older sibling. He wasn't in there long and somehow everyone eventually forgave him (including the sibling) and I grew up with him as my dad (not really understanding until my teens years how fucked up that was). It became this thing we (my family) never spoke about and I've still never told anyone irl.

Thing is he was always great to me. A great supportive dad and I loved him (although my feelings got more complicated and darker with age). Then a couple of years ago the same sibling (who is pretty mentally vulnerable) went to the police saying he'd started being inapproppriate again. Again! 25 years later. So he's now back in prison and I feel tricked and so so mad at him, that he'd carelessly screw up our lives again. 

But there's so many other feelings too. Judge me all you like but he was only ever a good dad to me and I love him as much as I hate him and I feel endlessly guilty for both feelings. He also getting old now and that worry doesn't help since I feel like there's so much unresolved between us - I've cut off contact now he's in prison. But I miss him. And I hate myself for missing him. 

Mostly I just feel like all this has fundamentally messed me up in some way and I'm always going to be defensive and isolated. I've always felt like this is some dark family secret (because it is and I've always been terrified of people knowing - like his actions somehow reflect badly on me) and its really made me become someone people find closed off and hard to connect with, which isn't helping me sort my life out.",05Aug2019,3

Specifically, my driving test. Basically, I had failed it three times before getting it right on try 4.

At the end, I was turning in to the last part of the drive just as my Instructor said that a car was pulling out of the parking lot of the testing center. Sure enough, I saw it. I had my turn signal on. I was already hyper focused so I'm sure I would have seen it without her pointing it out. I paused and let the other car pull out.

I went into the parking lot and turned into my driving spot. The instructor said I seemed a little nervous as I was pulling in. I began to ""Oh shit"" internally, but the instructor said that otherwise I have fully passed the test.

I thought I'd feel relived, but afterwards I felt nothing really after getting my license. Kinda numb really. I felt like I did something wrong and she only let me pass out of pity. It still haunts me to this day.

127," When I was 2yo, my parents left me with my grandparents and kept only occasional contact with me.  Grandparents were good people but in their home there was no place to show emotions,  no one talked about their problems, all matters were sweeping under the carpet.  When I was 13, parents took me to their home in another city and they never explained why they didn't take care of me from the beginning.  My mother even claims that it just seemed to me and that they visited me often.

 None of my parents have ever said that they love me,  I also do not remember that they hug me once.  We just lived in one house like roommates talking only about trivial or formal things.

My whole extended family is not too close.  Everyone has their own friends and doesn't pay much attention to family ties. Now that I am an adult, it seems to me beneficial -   no one intervenes in my affairs,  I do not feel any pressure from my family, I can work where i want, be who I want.

 But things are completely different in my boyfriends family.  Family integration is very important for them,  everyone knows everything about everyone and often meets at family conventions.  During these meetings they often play with children, cuddle, spend a lot of time together.  They ask a lot about our lives, and sometimes are very critical about my plans.

  I feel very uncomfortable at these meetings.  Touching people I do not know very well scares me and  I don't feel like answering questions about my plans and feelings.  Even hugging my own family feels odd to me, I dont even touch my parents.  When I think about hugging some little cousin I barely know, I feel my throat tightening and i want to run away.  It's not just anxiety,  I feel something like disgust... 

 I've been with my boyfriend for 4 years and he expects me to be a full member of their family.  But I want to associate with him and not with all these people. I didn't choose them, I don't care about them and I don't want them to interfere in my life too much.  Am I some kind of sociopath? 

 The strange thing is that I have no problem with making friends or partners.  But I can only get in touch with someone with whom I like each other  and it is independent of whether we are related . I mean,  why should I like someone just because we are by accident related ?  It does not mean that we have, for example, the same interests or similar views we have just same blood.  So why should I love my boyfriend's family?  I have no common themes with most of them and I do not feel a bond with them.

Today my bf asked me if I want to go with him, his aunt and 2 little cousins to the waterpark.

I feel very guilty for being alive and feeling the way that I do. Growing up was really difficult having teen parents. So in my head I was a mistake they decided to keep. My dad was extremely abusive in every way that he could be. He used to always tell me i was lucky to be alive and have food and shelter and other basic human needs. And he was right, I was lucky and I'm grateful I have those things as I'm aware lots of people struggle to survive. When I was 16 I hit rock bottom and made one of many attempts on my life. On the drive to the hospital my father told me he hated me and that I was ungrateful. At about 17 I left my dad's apartment to live with my mother and met a guy online from Canada and we started to date. I went to visit for a few months and that experience was up there with living with my father except now I was being s*xually abused and soon developed and eating disorder. I dropped to about the 80lb mark and the guy i was with said i should be grateful and lucky he helped me lose so much weight. He told me other girls would kill to be as thin as me. He said I should feel lucky to have him. I got treatment for my ED and am currently 120lbs and eating pretty ok now. I have since broken up with him after 3 years. Now I'm in a much better situation than where I used to be. I live with my mother still and have a pet and a boyfriend who treats me better dispite some minor issues. I have a stable job and have applied to colleges. But I still can't seem to get rid of the guilt that i feel for still feeling depressed. I haven't made attempts on my life anymore but find myself seriously planning it out. And I know I should get help for it but I seriously struggle with asking for help. I have this tight knot in my chest because I should be happy now. Things have gotten better for me and I'm progressing in life but feel like trash for still feeling this way. I don't know if anyone else feels this way. I really like to hope I'm not alone in this. I understand that different people have different situations, and that some are better off than others and dont have to struggle but I feel so awful knowing people struggle to survive and I'm here silently wishing for my life to end. I hope I'm not a bad person for feeling this way. 
Sorry for the emotional diahreea. I just needed to put all this somewhere and throwing it into the abyss of the internet seems like a good place for now.",05Aug2019,2

136,"I am 15 years old (16 in less than a weak) with OCD, GAD, and ADHD.  My anxiety tends to dwell on thoughts about my sexuality, I’m worried I can somehow change it even though I can’t.

I feel that a few months ago that my brain decided to block off all of my thoughts. This made it hard to be myself.  No one noticed anything but me. Today when I was doing my summer homework for AP world, I let it all back in. But it felt wrong so I blocked it out again.

Also for some reason I’m getting weird attractions to guys again. I know I’m straight but my mind messed with me.

Why am I blocking out ALL of my thoughts except for the ones I actually WANT TO. 

I still have fantasizes about girls but they come rarely and they feel desensitized and covered up. 

I had some bad experiences with girls too and my therapist and I discovered that that’s where it all came from.

Should I let my thoughts in and stop blocking them out? I don’t know what to do.

Any advice or support is very much appreciated. Thanks a ton for reading my post and thanks again if you reply.",05Aug2019,1
137,"Im studying abroad, so I've been looking for therapists. I met this one last week. The next day, i get an email saying something to the extent that we have something to discuss, she ""had a request"" that she couldn't go into. Wow, way to put on some unneeded anxiety.

This morning i get an email from the service that helped me find her. They said that the provider sent a recommendation to see a psychiatrist. I'd put money down to say that is what she wants to discuss, and she must've put that recommendation on paperwork. Possibly without realizing that the service was faster at inquiries than she thought. What a bad way to find out... and then have to wait a whole day.

So now I'm brewing on this and I am PISSED. This is not my first rodeo when it comes to therapy. This is not my first rodeo when it comes to psychiatrist. I have one at home. I'm so stable I figured that I could get my meds via a GP, and I have. My meds haven't changed in 10 months. I don't need a psychiatrist. 

Well, I've talked it over with my home therapist. We are going to skype. She still can legally, and I need to straighten out some paperwork but I have a decent amount of time before that. I trust her more than anyone to know what's best for my treatment. She's genuinely concerned for me and hasn't tried to send me to a hospital before just to save her ass.

Im done. Im pissed, I have homework and class to do, and I'm just ready to have fun and quit looking around for a therapist that won't understand my history.",05Aug2019,1
138,"I have had lots of mental health treatment over the past 34 years--both counseling and medication for chronic mild depression. Over the past 1.5 years I have gone without treatment, but recently I decided I could use both medicine for antidepressants and couples counseling. I discovered that my Oxford, UnitedHealth insurance doesn't cover couples counseling and as for individual psychotherapy and medication management the options are severely limited. But I have had so much treatment myself I don't ask for much. As far as meds go, I just basically need someone to write a prescription. I already have a pretty good idea what meds to take. But Friday I went to an mental health network which I had used before and not liked very much but at least they got me my meds. This time they screwed up various things. First, they assigned me to a doctor who is about to leave the organization. Second, she said she sent my subscription to the pharmacy but the pharmacy has no record of it. That was Friday and there is no way to get through to her or to the organization except leaving a message on their voice mail to which they say they will respond in 3 business days! My situation is not a dire emergency, but what if it were? They supposedly have an online patient portal but it doesn't work. Then on Monday morning they sent me an email saying my prescription had been filled but in fact it hadn't. And now I can't get any response from anyone. And they sent me the same link to their patient portal they had sent before, but there is still no way to message my doctor, which from what I understand is the main reason they have a patient portal. All day I have been trying to get through to them with no success. My copay (which I already paid) was $70. So far it is money down the drain. I used to pay out of pocket to see better doctors and get reimbursed by my insurers, but they would always make it very difficult to get reimbursed. My new insurance, however, does not even provide out of network benefits. Sorry, just needed to vent.",05Aug2019,1
139,"My dad passed away a month ago, I’m a 16 year old girl and smoke weed daily. 

Last night I was out with my boyfriend, all of a sudden I burst into tears and collapsed. I was screaming and crying, the most I have since he died. When I got home (very late) my mum was angry but I collapsed crying on her. Normally I’m very happy with life but I felt I just couldn’t go on. 

I was screaming about how she hates me and she was getting frustrated. I yelled at her to stop being mean and tried to run out of the house to my grandmas. She was scared and thought I was on loads of drugs. I curled in the floor shaking, saying how I need to kill myself. I really had an urge inside of me to go and end it all, I was in so much pain. 

By the time I’d finished crying around half an hour had passed. Now, Im back to myself, it was a truly out of body experience. 

If anyone could offer any suggestions of what happened to me I would be truly grateful.",05Aug2019,2
140,"My best friend and I are in a really bad place. She’s done so many things to make me believe she doesn’t truly care about me or truly value our friendship. Either that, or she feels like she can do whatever she pleases because she knows I won’t leave.

Friday she said she promised she was going to change. Sunday she went back to old behavior. 

But I’m working hard on my mental health. I’m committed to the journey of growing and healing, and feeling like she doesn’t value me or our friendship isn’t helping.

So I’m stepping back. I’m not reaching out for a bit. I don’t want to, but I feel like I have to give her room to miss me in order for her to value me. I’ll respond if I hear from her, but I won’t be making the initiative for a while. Is doing this manipulative? Is it unhealthy? I won’t see my therapist for a few more days to get her opinion, but I’ve started stepping back today, and from your perspective, I want to know: is this okay for me to do?",05Aug2019,2
141,"My depression and anxiety have spiralled out of control and I know I need intervention. I'm not actively planning to kill myself but I've lost all sense of self care and have been participating in extremely reckless behavior and opened the door to substance abuse. Just basically dont give a fuck if I die, but I dont want everyone to hate me for making that decision. 

I spent all day on the phone with the national suicide hotline and had a long discussion with my husband. He knows I need serious help and we both know that as much as I would like to, simply just taking time off work and staying home isnt going to make anything better. I need help. 

Im taking tonight to have a nice, comfortable night at home because leaving home is something I'm really scared to do. Im sure that this will be so beneficial and impprtant for me to go, but I'm so scared to do it. I dont know whats so scary but id love to hear positive stories from anyone who has stayed in csu and felt like it was the right choice.",05Aug2019,12
142,"I need to list it all. Don't know why, but i'm going to. 

I was abandoned by my mother to an abusive father. I don't even know what she sounds like anymore. I can barely picture her. 

She had a bunch of other kids apparently. My brother's and sisters I've never known. They're all probably adults with their own kids now. 

My father is the central figure to the pain in my life. He was physically abusive; beating me with boards, belts , clubs, anything. Sometimes he'd hit so much in an area i'd bleed through the bruises. I was always having to hide from the rest of the world because of it. Several times he came close to killing me. Once even choking me till I blacked out. I remember blacking out a lot. 

He was mentally abusive. He was controlling. I was homeschooled so I never interacted with other kids. I only interacted with adults as far as he allowed. I was never allowed to be to far from him and was always afraid of his reaction if I did the wrong thing because of his fits of rage. When I was around other kids it wasn't long after he would forbid me to interact with them.

He was a drug dealer. Which exacerbated all the need to hide. I was made to be afraid of bringing too much attention because of it. 

There's a book worth of incidences I could list with him. None of it ceased until I was a teenager and tried to hit him with a shovel then he moved away and separated from my life more.

After that till present day he kept getting in trouble. Getting arrested, put in jail, out on probation, arrested again getting my truck (not in my name) confiscated, put in prison, out on probation, arrested again and only released because of his health. 

My grandmother was always there for both of us. She tried so hard to correct what he'd done. But at the end of the day I realized that if she had a choice to help him she would no matter the cost, even if it was me. 

In my teenage years I found religion. Attended a church. Had friends and peers of every age. Most of them died through suicide, illness, or old age over several years. Including the first person I considered my best friend; suicide. I looked into it recently; of everyone I was close to in those days, that isn't family, i'm the only one still alive. 

I was so filled with rage in my late teens I did a number of things to act out: hitting things, punching walls, cheating people, yelling. I was turning into him. 

Also in my late teens to early 20s I was forced into taking care of my grandmother's mother who suffered heavily from degenerating dementia. It was due to those days I realized my grandmother was much more like my father than I realized. I'd look after her mother during the day, she'd do it at night. It stayed that way for roughly 4 years till her mother died in front of us. I was the one that tried to resuscitate her. 

My grandmother still says it was good that we did that, an that I was a godsend. For me it was hell. 

Things got better into my twenties. My father keeps managing to get arrested and nearly burn everything and everyone with him, but I've separated myself from it much as I can and continue to do so. 

I'm 35 now. Because of all this I've constantly fought with depression and came close, really close, to suicide more than once. Last year was rough. I think i'd built up dams to protect me from feeling the weight of it all, but it all came crashing down last year. My dad got arrested again, nearly died from illnesses. I spent several months convincing myself not to kill myself. Finally I got to a point where I feel like i'm on a placid lake floating. 

An this all is just a quick summary. I think i'm better now, but I still struggle to keep my head above water.  Some days I feel like a ghost. Like the world is something just happening around me. An I'm strangely fine with it. 

Anyway. I just needed to say it.",05Aug2019,1
143,"Recently, I slowly decreased my dosage of my fluvoxamine until it was eventually 0mg. That was maybe 2 weeks or so ago. But lately, Ive been noticing some new habits that I’ve never experienced before, and I’m wondering if its normal. 

Firstly, I have been lucky enough to be quite accepting of my body image. I never tried to diet or go crazy in order to be skinny. I was happy about my body, period. But lately, I have been noticing my body more. Looking in the mirror to see if I have a nicer body shape, if my belly got smaller or larger, if my shoulder blades are less noticeable, etc. I have never in my life exercised on a consistent basis nor ever tried to. But I have been exercising every day for maybe a week now in an attempt to try and get a better body. I know that this might just sound like I’m looking out for my health, which it could be. But my motivation has always been at 0, and I have never cared about what my body looked like, so why now am i so observant and wanting change?

Another thing that I’ve only really noticed these past few days, is that I am way too emotional. Since last night, Ive caught myself wanting to cry 4 different times over 4 different things. And about really pointless things that I would never cry over. I had my period early last week, so I cant see how it could be my hormones causing it. PMS usually just makes me pissed off. I’m not really a cryer either.

And if I wanted to continue medication, I cant exactly do so. I had to end therapy there because I’m moving to college a few towns away. And for this place, they require therapy in order to receive medication. Not only that though, I just want to end taking medication because I have been feeling consistently well in terms of my mental health and outlook on life, and I would rather not worry about taking medication in college. What do you think of all of this?",05Aug2019,1
144,"Hey Reddit users,


I'm going to be real with you all. I suffered  from Anxiety and Depression when I was a teenager. So much so that I would have panic attacks when I was with other people. I would have to vomit outside! Not good for popularity!

Through years of hard work, I am proud to say that I fought it and I am not a senior psychiatric nurse for the NHS.

It hasn't been easy. But wow has the fight been worth it.

I'm now going to share my tips and guides on how to fight mental health, and also give you some real life down to earth experiences of mine, both as a person with anxiety, and also as a mental health profession. 

Mental health doesn't pull any punches.  So we arent going to either.

My mind is always racing with so many thoughts, so many things and topics. It changes so often that I never keep track of what I am thinking.

 That's the reason I get distracted, I forget stuff or get all day dreamy. I think about past, the future, or just a ton of bad thoughts, even if I am thinking about good things, within minutes will be back to bad thoughts.

Some day's it's easier, some day's it's harder.

That's why I like to distract myself, I absolutely cannot do not do nothing, because it gets overwhelming. I do thing's that I don't even enjoy anymore. Drawing, playing game's, going out, watching movies, reading, watching videos on YouTube even eating food. I don't enjoy it, but it sure keeps the mind busy with a task. It makes my mind follow one path of thought.

But at night, there is nothing to really distract me. It's hard for me to fall asleep, I don't know the reasons of why I am an insomniac, been like that for years. But it doesn't help. I find myself snaping out of my thoughts realizing I have been stering at a wall for an hour or several hours, with deep emotion of sadness? Numbness? It's hard to describe and I never was good on picking up with emotions are with, I feel so tired on the mind and the only thing I need is for everything to end. It always comes to it when I don't keep myself busy.   I might lay awake for many hour's, until my brain just disconnects from being tired. But it doesn't always work and some day's I have to go all night without sleep. But then I usually try to keep myself distracted as well.

Sometimes I write stories in my head to help me to distract myself, with characters from movie's or game's. It works, and in rare cases I even fall asleep like that. But usually I just run out of story's to think of and go back to good old thoughts. 

Oh well, what can I say, but good night me everytime before bed. Because I truly hope for it.


Oh and medicine for sleep dosent work for me, and I can't get prescription for anything stronger because issues.",05Aug2019,2

147,"I heard this at church some time ago, but has been coming back to mind lately. 

In original context, people were talking about martyrs from the Bible and dying for Christ etc, and someone stated that dying for a cause is easy. One action and done. But *living* for that same cause is where the challenges come up. Where things actually start to become difficult. 

Lately I've been thinking that this can apply to more than just religious views. Living each day, living with a purpose and for something, is the challenge we each face each day.

For me, I'm in Hell. Have been for almost a year. Each day is another version of Hell, and a lot of times worse than the previous day, but I'm still living because my one year old needs the only parent she has left. Now, I don't claim to be anything special, but I have been thinking about the person that said that *living* is the true challenge. 

I think more n more I agree with whoever it was that said it, and just wanted to share with everyone: if you're still alive, if you're still living day to day, whether it be Hell or just eh- you accepted the challenge to live. And you're doing it. You're stronger than you think. We can do this together. Just keep waking up each morning, and live another day.",05Aug2019,1
