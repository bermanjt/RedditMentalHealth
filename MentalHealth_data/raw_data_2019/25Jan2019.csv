My brother is normal, but a little anxious about what's going to happen to his daughter and a bit traumatized! who wouldn't be after being in a relationship with a psychopath. not being mean and I don't take the label lightly. PURE PSYCHOPATH!!! She's been diagnosed and told my whole family... and now she's changing her story. anything we say that makes her look bad is fake news. the point? I don't want another psychological axe murderer (read psychopath who studied psychology (my ex-sister-in-law), in the world and I don't want my sweet and innocent young niece to be that axe murderer. Life is only hard and unfair because psychopaths make it that way. the most eminent psy.d. that specializes in psychopathy said that the psychopathic 1% cause more damage to society than the 99% remaining personalities combined.

1,"  I’m 17, male and I believe I’m suffering from depression and anxiety for what’s been 2 years, I’ve been contemplating posting my ‘story’ here before, but I really couldn’t bring myself to do it. However, I recently had an episode, one of my worst I’d say and I’m at my breaking point I am feeling completely hopeless at this point. I’ve been told I need to go to my GP and get help for this, but the issue is the thought of going is scaring the living shit out of me – I feel as I’m going to go there and just freeze up, or that they are just going to dismiss my mental state as nothing and send me on my way. I really don’t know what to do I’m in serious need of advice, is it just that I’m going to try my absolute hardest and bite the bullet and go but even that seems like that’s too big of a reach.",25Jan2019,1

3,"Hello. I am from the US and my friend in Alberta desperately needs medical care for mental health issues. She is not currently in any state to be looking for this information herself, but i need help in order to do it for her. I cant easily make calls to Canada to find out what place would be suitable for her. I wanted to know if anyone could steer me in the direction of other resources, or if i happen to reach anyone who is from the area who has been to an inpatient ward, please let me know if the experience you had was helpful or harmful. I want to be sure that I am giving her the information about someplace that will have a positive impact on her, while also keeping her safe and observed. ",25Jan2019,1
4,"When seeing a psychologist I have been given activity sheets to work on for certain things.

I found these to be really helpful and was hoping to find more of them, as I know a lot of psychologists have different ones relating to different anxieties/mental health disorders. 

I was hoping if anyone had any they were willing to share that they found helpful or if anyone knows of anywhere I could find some online. 
I'm not looking for anything specific and kind of want to browse a few to see what could work for me.

Thanks in advance! ",25Jan2019,1

8,"First question...  
Is there something inbetween emergency inpatient treatment and weekly therapy? Maybe something to keep someone safe from self-harming while they are attending therapy and allowing their meds to regulate?   


I wonder sometimes if my family just doesn't know all the right options. We are doing our best.   


Second question...  
Where and how should someone get diagnosed? With the irregularity of visits my loved one has had, I am not so sure they have really had someone who fully understands them and has a good grasp on their actual issues (not just emergency issues or situational). I worry they have been misdiagnosed multiple times. That's important for meds, right? ",25Jan2019,1
9,"Hi all,

This is my first Reddit post, I never really talk about anything to anyone but I need to get this off my chest, sorry to seem like a pain.

I have severe Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), anxiety and bipolar, having  been diagnosed in 2017 (although I can’t remember a day I never was like this, I just never had a crisis enough to attend a psychiatrist unit, more of that some other time maybe).

I was offered to be put on a mood stabiliser for my bipolar, and an anti-depressive for my OCD (I could react badly without the mood stabiliser), but I was too scared to actually take more medication than I already am for my other conditions, specially as I know people who medication made them worse, and pressure from my family not to take meds.

I convinced my psychiatrist that I was getting better and, in our last appointment, totally fine and happy in life for a year and that I had no manic or depressive episodes, even though it was not true. 

She referred me to get CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therspy) for my OCD and as I was ‘fine’ as far as she was aware, she didn’t continue with medication for my bipolar and discharged me. 

Don’t get me wrong, she was an amazing professional and I couldn’t have had a better psychiatrist. 

I got offered an appointment for my CBT but as I was abroad I couldn’t open the letter (I was unaware) and as I had missed my appointment as I was in another country, I got discharged from the CBT sevice automstically.

In the past weeks since I got discharged, my life and disorders have had a turn for the worst with me contemplating suicide every minute of the day, even though I know I won’t do anything as my girlfriend and my family love me so much and I couldn’t hurt them like that. But I feel sometimes that it’s the best way out. I’ve had a business failure, I’m tens of thousands of pounds in debt, I’m just 18 with no future right now and my mother is moving to another country whilst my girlfriend is here, and I don’t know what to do as I’ve never been away from my mum, and my girl is two hours away by car, longer by train, and my heart is split in three places, I feel like death is an option to get out of everything.

I’d like to go see my psychiatrist again and sort everything out but I’m too embarrassed to go back, and my family thinks I’m well so it’d be out of the blue and bizarre, so I’m terrified of going back if I had to...

I don’t know why the heck I wrote this, sorry for wasting your time, I just don’t know what to do. I’ve had so many business failures ever since I was 15, some were successful but they weren’t what I wanted to do (yes, I know I’m still young), and I know my mental health affected my decisions and that’s why I stopped doing a few businesses. I still have my ambition but I want stability and I know life’s not easy. I’m very grateful for each opportunity I’ve had but I’m just scared I’m a failure already...

Sorry,

Thanks for taking your time,

TL;DR - I basically lied to my psychiatrist that I was ok when I wasn’t and now I’m too scared to go back because I’m feeling suicidal.",25Jan2019,1

I (25, F) have battled for quite some time with mental duress. Never officially diagnosed, but there’s always been something there. In the past I’ve struggled with unhealthy restrictive eating, and various types of self harm. These symptoms have ebbed and flowed, and I’ve never been able to get into the mindset of reaching out for help for many reasons. The stigma, the fact that once there’s a diagnosis it’s real, like someone else in the world knows and I can’t hide from it anymore, and also because even though there were some really bad times, I was always able to “resurface”. 

Recently though, I haven’t been able to break out of the down, and I’ve been having increasingly dark thoughts. I don’t feel joy, and when I’m in situations that I believe I should be feeling joy I feel guilty for not being there. 
I feel responsible for not being able to shake myself out of this slump. Cooking and cleaning may as well be climbing Everest. And I genuinely worry about the pressures And burdens my attitude is putting on my family. 

I had an “enough is enough” moment, after keeping my boyfriend up all night, sobbing for the hundredth time. And I marched myself in to the mental health walk-in clinic that I’ve been eying in my town for quite some time. (I was so impressed that this was even a thing- I’m in Atlantic Canada, for a reference). 

I spoke with a social worker there, who said to me it sounded like I may have clinical depression, and that an antidepressant may work wonders for me. She gave me a plethoras if literature, and wrote a summary of our visit for me to give to an MD. 

Here’s where it gets tricky. I’m new to the province and am no where near getting a medical doctor. Still, she said that if you go to walk-ins with the summary she provided, I should be able to make some progress. 

The amount of relief I feel waking out of that office is unlike anything I’ve ever experienced in my life. The next day was the most hopeful I’ve had in a while. 

And then came Saturday. The day I ventured to the walk ins. Armed and ready. Naive to how the next three hours of my life would play out. 
The receptionist was quite frank and told me they could not do anything for me without a family doctor, and I should just go home because, and I quote, “there are sick people here”. I thanked her and sat down to wait. As far as I was concerned I was one of the sick people. I was riding the high of my hope from the day previous. I was taking responsibility for my healing. 

I sit there for 3 hours and finally get in to see the doctor, who echos the same exact thing that the receptionist said. He explains that they do not prescribe antidepressants to people without a family doctor, as there is no follow up. Nor do they prescribe them without physiological assessment. 

Completely logical. I’m a well educated, reasonable person. All of this makes sense to me. 

But the thing is, there are over 8,000 people waiting for a family doctor in my area. I will be waiting for quite some time. This coupled with the fact that I had been so naively hopefully resulted in complete, ugly, gut wrenching tears on my part. 

I tried to explain that I was at the walking because I didn’t want it to get worse- which is what I fear waiting will do. That people come here when it’s not bad enough to go to the emergency room, and that I didn’t want it to get that bad. 

At this point the snot and the tears have melted on my face. The doctor (who was not an unkind man, likely just not prepared for me) tried to ask me what was wrong in my life. 

I explained that that’s the point. My life is mostly great with some average parts. I’m extremely lucky, and yet here I am, either numb or crying. 

I was crying to the point of dry heaving, a mixture between angry at the system, angry at myself for foolishly thinking it would be easier, and mourning the loss of the hope I had felt the day before. 

The doctor did end up writing me a prescription, either because he wanted me out of his office or because he could see I needed some form of help. 

But he didn’t ask about any medications I was on (which I am) or any health issues I have (which I do), or any family members who may also suffer from depression (my sister does). Which just make this whole thing more confusing/aggravating. 

I went there for help. If I need an evaluation with a psychologist before going on antidepressants- I want that. If I can sort this out without the medication- I want that. If I can’t and I need to take them- that’s cool too. 

What I don’t want is to make the situation worse. 

It will be a week ago tomorrow that I received the prescription, and I still haven’t brought it to a pharmacy. 

There has got to be a better way. It’s not uncommon in Atlantic Canada for people to go long periods of time without a family doctor. Asking for help is hard for me when I’m in a positive mind space- it was near impossible last week. And now after this experience I don’t know how not to be discouraged about it.

I don’t know what The point of this is. Just to rant, I guess. I’m sorry to anyone who has ever felt this way. 

tl;dr: finally worked up the courage to seek help for mental health, social worker suggested antidepressants. Met resistance with MD because I don’t have a family doctor &amp; cried the hardest I ever have in my life. Got prescription, but have been too dissatisfied with the experience to believe taking it is the safest option. ",25Jan2019,1
12,"Over the past 2 years I've been gaining a lot of weight (like 40kg) because of problems I'd rather not discuss. I knew it was unhealthy but didn't really think much of the social aspect of it, thinking personality is more important yada yada yada. Anyway, there's this girl that I kind of know through mutual friends and we followed each other on Instagram a couple years ago. I haven't posted for a long time and she hasn't seen me for a while. I was walking out one day and she saw me and I didn't think much of it. Then I was on Instagram and saw I had one less follower. It was her. Right after seeing what I looked like now, she unfollowed me. I don't know if it's a big deal but it hurt, because it made me realise people actually don't like me now, just because I'm fat. I know this isn't really mental health but it just made me really sad.",25Jan2019,1
13,"I don't know what to do in regards to what's going on in my head. It's been a year in which I have episodes of hopelessness and complete despair at least every week or so. Nothing is wrong, I'm extremely blessed. I'll just suddenly feel so anxious and alone and trapped. I get the urge to isolate myself and feel heaviness on my chest. I found about 2 weeks ago that inflicting pain on myself physically gives me so much relief. When I do, I feel like I can breathe again and I'm scared that it'll become a habit. I definitely don't plan to kill myself even though I fantasize about it at times. Is this normal for a teenager? I got off all social media last year when I first started feeling these things. I take care of myself so much better but now, a year later, nothing has changed. I know that it's super easy to feel overwhelmed with all of the hormones, but I don't hear any people my age really talk about this. I'm a very social person and I have a great relationship with my family, I'm very involved in school, and my life is good. It's just this pattern that I thought was going to end a long time ago hasn't. Since then, I've felt much more disconnected with my friends. I don't care about things as much as I used to and people tell me I've changed. I don't want to speak to my parents about this (even though I trust them so, so much) because I don't want them to get worried, especially if it's just a stage that I'm going through as a teen. I'm scared of speaking to a school counselor because of the self-harm part. I feel uncomfortable when I'm alone because I get scared that I'll start feeling that way again. When I'm around people I feel like I'm distracted temporarily, but even then I'm usually zoning out. Don't get me wrong, I have really good times too. A lot of things make me happy, but everything is so temporary. I've been exercising to feel better too, but it doesn't help nearly as much as self-harm. I just want to know: is this okay? Is it necessary that I speak to someone about this? Do all teenagers go through this? Thank you so much. ",25Jan2019,1
14,"The past year has been a nightmare. Nothing less. On Mother’s Day my mother and only surviving parent had a stroke and went into the hospital. After several months of trying to motivate her to participate in rehab therapy, she passed away early December. She was under 70. I had been living with her and carry so much guilt from not being able to care for her better. 

The day before her stroke, I was unable to get out of bed. Crippled with depression and feeling stress from a shit job that I cared too much about. At one point during that day I had even looked into outpatient programs around my area, knowing well that if I didn’t reach out to someone soon, I would try to kill myself for a third time. That’s embarrassing to admit; that the two previous times I couldn’t even manage to off myself correctly. Add those tries to the multitude of mistakes I’ve made in 30 years. 

When it appeared my mother might just have a real shot at recovery, I sat down with a calendar and started looking at dates a few months out - I needed time to clean the house, sell my belongings and ensure my brother, my only other surviving relative, was not left with a mess. November 3rd was the day I settled on. I began to clean the house; donate items and toss what wouldn’t be wanted. I began to stockpile meds and went so far as to take a class on using a firearm so I would be prepared when the time came. As my mothers condition worsened and her inability to participate in her own recovery began to be her undoing, I felt the need to not add more stress to the situation. I didn’t want her heart to break any more than it had already been broken. She had stopped eating by the end of September and the towel was officially thrown in shortly after. I couldn’t blame her for not wanting to be here, to be stuck in a body she no longer had much control over, to be surrounded by the miserable atmosphere within the nursing home. To know she would never come home to her puppies, her own bed, her old life - everything she had known since the mid 80s when the home was purchased. Inside I felt hurt, maybe even jealous to some extent that I couldn’t take her place. I was upset she was essentially choosing a slow suicidal when all my life I’d been told again and again by this woman that it was disgustingly selfish. Being a child of someone raised in the 50s/60s, mental illness was something that HAD to be in the bloodline. It was something that didn’t exist outside sanatoriums from ghost hunter shows she watched or trials of the seriously sinister on Investigation Discovery. From the time I was old enough to understand what the symptoms of depression were, I was told there was no history of mental illness in the family, therefore it didn’t exist. I was “too sensitive, overly emotional”.  Despite my outward appearance, that of a lanky kid with almost black hair who just wanted to play kickball and be one of the boys, my mom never questioned gashes, bruises or wounds that had been self inflicted for years. 

At 16, I made the first attempt to take my life.  Naively downing an entire bottle of Tylenol PM and any prescriptions I could find in the house. Clearly all I accomplished was making myself extremely sick. I remember waking up a day or so later, fully coherent and being thankful I was still alive. The sun felt warmer on that day than any beautiful day before. People seemed nicer. It felt like maybe this (the self hate, worthlessness, consuming depression) was something I had to put to rest before I could be whole again. Sadly it wasn’t long before I fell back into self destructive habits, more angry with myself for now having confirmation I was a failure. I became more brazen when I felt the need to self harm; instead of being methodical and exacting about the process, I got sloppy. I didn’t care if my tool of choice was clean, if I had peroxide or iodine to clean with, bandages to cover the damage. I managed to somehow make it to 19 before trying to overdose a second time. I went to a friends house, spent the night and asked to stay another. I snuck home and into our finished basement where I downed pain pills, benzos and finished off two bottles of vodka before falling asleep.  Since I’m here and typing this,  you can guess what the outcome was. 

For the next decade I would keep everything to myself. The self harm increased. I found new ways to punish myself and ‘cope’.  The desire to die never left. I took everything to the extreme. I did things I never thought I would do. At the same time, I honestly did not care. The only regret I have is not going further. Not fully allowing myself to go down the rabbit hole out of obligation to my coworkers - not my family.  For some reason I felt it was important to show up for them until I had everything ironed out in the chaos that is my mind. I also couldn’t take the devastation of facing failure for a third time.  When I finally felt I had my out planned, hours of time spent into researching and saving money to get away from my situation, my dad passed from a massive heart attack. My attention immediately went to caring for my mom, doing everything I could to fill my fathers shoes and be the support she needed. When she passed this past December, my expiration date was instantly reset. Mid February.  

I’ve been in and out of forms of treatment. I’ve done minimal outpatient, talk therapy, journaling, art therapy. I’ve seen several psychiatrists, been on just about every medication for PTSD, severe depression, anxiety and BPD. I’ve tried diving into CBD, meditation and self care - I couldn’t commit to something I didn’t believe in doing. I feel I have exhausted any help available. At this point I don’t see a point to pouring money into things that aren’t helping. For six years I’ve been hoping for that Ah-ha! moment where all the words spoken at me about how life is worth living... they’ve just been in vain. They were only said because the person opposite me was recalling the script laid down for tense situations. After losing my job, the one I mentioned caring about too much earlier, after working for the company for 11 years - being cornered into resigning due to the fact I was receiving calls from the hospital ICU to make decisions that would impact my mothers recovery, I have yet to find a new job and it’s not from lack of trying. Wanting to find a full time, non-seasonal job anytime from Oct-Jan is a joke. Retail, unfortunately is what I know. It’s not where I want to be. I refuse to work for $9/hr and have my job dangled over my head if I’m unable to nail down a certain amount of credit card apps in one day. Is that all I am worth? Fuck that. Fuck trying anymore. I am fucking exhausted 24 hours a day. Fuck feeling invalidated by others who tell me there’s nothing wrong with me, it’s normal to feel all I’ve felt and continue to feel. There is nothing worse than not being able to stomach your own reflection and being alone with that shit day in and day out.

Since I can remember I've always craved my own self destruction, whether it be cutting myself or throwing up after every meal. But when he said he'd hurt me I thought about how much I wanted that. I don't know why, but I think it's because I find it really hard to hurt myself. 

 It would be easier if someone else hurt me. I know how bad that is, But I still want it. I think that's why I'm still in this relationship. He's cheated on me twice, stolen from my family, got me to smoke, left bruises all over me, told a random girl how he analed me, lied endlessly,  etc. He had caused me so much pain.

20,"TLDR: i'm a college sophomore in the united states, under my parents medical insurance &amp; i want to see a therapist, but i dont know how to tell them, where to start, or if i really have a valid reason to see one. i live near my college campus but my parents are in the same state.

~ my spiel~
it s kind of stupid but, today a youtuber i like posted a video about his depression. in the video he said, ""if you were looking for a sign to get help, this is it! this is your day!"" 

it got to me, weirdly. my friends have told me before they think i need therapy (i felt kind of offended more than anything at the time) because of an array of reasons (i.e. brushing off my problems, self-esteem issues, weird angsty funks i get myself into, etc)

but most times i tell myself i dont need one, i'm not facing any incredible struggle &amp; i'm just making up that i need help or that i'm sad or whatever. imposter syndrome? idk. i also am not a big fan of self-diagnosis so i would never label myself with [so-or-so mental health issue], but when i read about symptoms, i see myself. and then i fall into thinking that i'm just making that up, too. 

my parents are in charge of my insurance, i'm a sophomore in college, &amp; have begun thinking maybe a therapist could help me. it surely couldn't hurt to try. 

i know this sounds like a cry for attention honestly, i do. i just dont know where else to turn to to ask.

Here, people can share their survival stories, support others in the same situations, or just say something to brighten someone's life.

23,"That never-ending internal struggle is really driving me crazy. One half of me is ambitious, unstoppable. Has a focus and drive that no distraction can penetrate. It feels like I can do anything in the world and I can do it absolutely alone. There are goals and motivations and dreams, things to accomplish and things to look forward to. Reasons to live and excitement found in everything. Not afraid to try new things, even welcoming it. Not afraid of anything, it feels like nothing could get in my way. I wouldn’t let it. That half has hope, that half is still a dreamer and wants to try despite knowing the outcome. That half hopes that things might be different just this once. That maybe they’ve changed. Maybe it isn’t as bad as I expected, maybe it’ll end differently. Without fail, tragically yet expectedly, ends up wounded each and every time, the pain more agonizing each time. But there’s always that warm familiarity of disappointment and sadness for it to run back to.

The other half says shut the fuck up, you worthless piece of shit, you’re never going to get anywhere. Your dreams and hopes? Fucking forget it, you’re always a disappointment in the end. You can’t and haven’t done anything with your useless life. You’re not worth it for anyone to stay, for anyone to bother dealing with. You’re not worth it to anyone, how haven’t you noticed that by now? Stop trying and just give up already, stop clinging on. All you do is fuck up and it’s all you’re good for, you can’t do anything right and you always end up being a burden to everybody around out. Always causing problems. You should just stay away and life would be easier, it goes on without your presence. 

Then, there’s that little shred of conscience left that prevents me from ever doing anything rash. It makes me feel guilty, it stops me from doing wrong. Prevents me from being completely selfish for once. It prevents me from only thinking about myself and how I feel. It’s sickening that I always put everyone above myself even if I’m dying inside, and no matter how much I want to be selfish, it’s impossible because I’ll get absolute hell from myself for making that decision. It stops me from just completely giving up and taking the easy road to solve my problems no matter how much I want to — it forces me to suffer through the hard road, to endure things I didn’t know I could, to barely push through to the end. Barely hanging on, falling apart completely. Breaking, if not already broken.

And for what? Life is fleeting. Nothing makes a difference to me, life is rinse-and-repeat, an endless cycle of repetitiveness until the day death takes its hold on you and you welcome the freedom it grants you. At the end of the day, does it really matter? Everything is lost in the end. What’s the end game here? Suffering each and every day, pouring blood, sweat, and tears into life, but what do you get out of it? Temporary happiness? A distraction from the fact that life is meaningless? Ceasing to exist rather than suffering day-to-day, that would certainly be the peaceful option.

I mean I wish I could just ignore it, I really do. This is why I need medication. It’s not just about my own willpower or wanting to change the way I think because believe me, no matter how hard I’ve tried, the root of the problem always comes back to haunt me in the end. It’s a demon that refuses to leave. This is how my brain works whether I like it or not. It’s not as simple as just trying to change my thought process or trying to forget about all my problems even though they’re well past. It’s a fucking real struggle to fight this demon, simply because it’s what comes naturally to me. I think that’s the part that everyone I try to explain this to just really doesn’t get. 

My brain doesn’t work the same way a normal person’s would, this way of thinking is so fucked up and it always has been; all the problems in my life only contributed to it, they were never the sole cause. I’ve been this way since I was so young, and sure I can take steps to improve my thinking and all that, to work on myself, but the straight up answer is that it will never disappear because that’s how I am and there isn’t shit I can do to change that fact. I can mask it, that’s all I can do because no amount of willpower in this world or reliance on God can fix this way of thinking; if it could, almost 19 years later I wouldn’t still be this way. It’s literally like that one song, idontwannabeyouanymore, 

I was made from a broken mold and just have to accept that. That entire song sums up exactly how I feel about myself. No one could ever understand what it feels like to be me, what it feels like to be tormented by your own mind on a daily basis and the amount of strength it takes just to fight it. No one understands how hard it is to keep fighting and not want to just give up and die, it’s so tempting to take the easy way out. The thing I have to realize is that I’m broken and I can only patch it to feel normal, but I will never be normal. I don’t think anyone knows how that feels unless they’ve gone through the same thing themselves. 

Everyone always says you need to try harder, you need to change your mind set. I honestly wish it was that easy. Like I said, no one understands just how hard it is.. If I wasn’t trying, I wouldn’t even be here anymore. I would’ve gave up so long ago but I’m still holding on and refusing to completely give in, even if I’ve come so close to doing so several time. No one understands how it feels, and if I’m honest that makes me feel so alone in this world. I feel like I can’t even open up to anyone because I can’t accurately explain how I feel. It’s not a point of focusing on the ambitious side, it’s the fact that I have to fight so hard to control it and I don’t always win that battle. Being constantly tormented by my own mind every fucking day isn’t exactly something easy to live with. 

And neither is the fact that whether I like it or not, I’m broken and there isn’t shit I can do about that except to mask it and pretend I’m normal like everyone else. It’s not something easy to come to terms with, because now not only do I not have control of my body’s limitations and what I can do with it, but I don’t even have control over my own mind and my emotions. I don’t know how people don’t understand this, all I’m ever told is either to get over it because life is hard, you’re not trying hard enough, you don’t want to help yourself. That’s the farthest thing away from the truth.",25Jan2019,1

So I’ve never really talked to anybody about this issue but I’m in my last semester of high school and it’s something that has been bothering me throughout these past four years. Hopefully this is the right place to talk about this, thank you for anybody that is willing to listen. 

      Ever since freshman year I’ve felt an increasing feeling of isolation from people in my grade and school. I feel as if I am on the outside looking in at an almost weblike social structure between different cliques and groups and I just feel like a leftover who doesn’t really belong anywhere. 
     The main thing that bothers me is I feel like there is this aura of exclusivity around these cliques at my school and I just feel totally left out. It’s to the point where I don’t even like walking in the hallway anymore because of everybody talking to each other in their groups. Im not an introvert; I thrive when I am talking to people at school, but i just feel shut out from the rest of my grade. 

     I honestly have a feeling this is coming from insecurities of myself. I haven’t talked to hardly any girls because I just feel so insecure all the time. I’ve never hung out with a girl. I feel like a complete loser every day in school and now I am in debate class and am terrified to get up in front of the class. I wish I just wasn’t insecure and I wish I didn’t care so much about the social aspect of school. People are going to all these different places for spring break together at school and nobody has invited me anywhere and I just feel so alone and I really need somebody to help me out I feel terrible about myself and I feel like I wasted high school. 


    Sorry if this post makes no sense. I really just started writing and wrote whatever came to my mind. Maybe I overthink things too much, maybe I am insecure, maybe I am depressed, I have no idea. But the feeling (which has increased) the last 4 years of high school is making me feel terrible and it’s hard to go to school because I feel sad and scared.

I have never opened up about any issues I’ve had in part because I feel ashamed of myself and also I feel as if nobody else goes through what I go through. I guess I just need somebody to talk to. 


    I’ll try to be specific.

Throughout high school I’ve always had friends. Never been a popular kid, but people who know me know I try to be a a legitimate caring friend. I would say I’m an extrovert. I love when somebody says hi to me in the hallway or I meet somebody new, and I love hanging out with friends. 

   Gradually throughout high school I have felt like I’ve been torn down as a person. I feel defeated. I used to be such a happy kid who didn’t care what people thought but now I hate walking in the hallways and avoid school sporting events because I just feel isolated from the people at my school. Everybody seems to have their exclusive  clique, which are connected to other cliques. I feel like I am an outsider in the social aspect of my school. I’m afraid to talk to most people in my grade because I feel like they are above me in a social aspect. I’m afraid to talk to girls because I am insecure about myself. I haven’t hung out with a girl in my entire life. It’s hard for me to talk to girls because I feel like they will think I’m a loser. In class I am always anxious because it seems like everybody knows each other and they have no interest in getting to know me. 
   
    I feel depressed at school. I feel like I wasted high school being a loser and while other kids are planning their spring break vacations I’m going to be sitting at home alone. While other kids are asking dates to prom I don’t have anybody to ask. When other kids are getting invited to grad parties I won’t be. I feel sad, lonely, and honestly a little depressed right now. Have never felt quite like this in my whole life, and I am just looking for some help.

The article said people who is depression is dysfunctional in social interactions, which further explains that they usually violate social norms interacting:’the pro-happiness social norm cause people to approach social interaction with the expectation of positive exchange, however, individuals with depression typically violate these expectations”.

So people do find depressing people annoying, just they don’t usually show it out. 

The article also stated that people who found annoyed by depressive people may avoid contacting or approach negatively in the future. Which is serious, because this causes reinforcements, depressing people will stay in the same stage since people surrounding them reinforce their behaviors.

What I tried to say, depressing people have to interact to more positive environment to form their new behaviors, if they stick with their old environments, nothing will change.

46,"I’m in my final semester of my nursing program and I am really struggling to manage my stress, which then leads to my depression “flaring up” because I feel like I’m a failure of a human being if I can’t handle stuff that everyone else seems to be able to. 

This final semester is where we work full time with a nurse on 12 hour shifts and only have a certain number of shifts (35) before we are done. In that time, we are expected to work towards becoming independent and confident in our abilities, and only need our instructor as a supervisor rather than a lead. 

It’s incredibly stressful because I feel like my instructor is expecting way too much from me very early on. For example, I was given a full patient load and expected to manage on my own on the third shift (which is crazy because usually you start the first week by shadowing and then get one patient with lots of help). I ended up breaking down after the shift because I felt like it went horribly wrong and I had no idea what I was doing. This was all in front of my instructor. 

After that shift, she said she realized she was putting too much on me too early on and she was going to slow down a bit however she hasn’t. The last few shifts I’ve had three patients and been expected to complete skills independently that I have never seen demonstrated nor completed myself. 

She is also continually criticizing me by saying things like “your IV bag is running on fumes, you need to change that before shiftchange (it was the end of the shift) otherwise you’re leaving your teammates stranded!” When in reality, the bag still had about 200 mls in it running at 82/hr. I can’t seem to anticipate her expectations of me because in that example, I figured the other shift had at least two hours before they ran out, and the new bag was already pulled and ready to go sitting in the med room. 

I come home exhausted and feeling like I have no clue what I am doing. Is this normal? I feel like I won’t ever get to the point where I can work independently and yet we are given so little time to do so.

50,"Hello reddit,

I just wanted to share one of the most traumatizing experiences four my mental health in my life that I'm still extremely tender about a decade later.

So a little backstory, my father and I have always butted heads. I don't know if it's because we just have personalities that clash or if because he's abusive (unintentionally and mental, not physical). My father was THE guy back in high school. Typical jock popular with everyone. If he didn't like you, no one did. Was probably a big bully like he was to me growing up.

Anyway, growing up around him was difficult for me because while he provided food shelter and a lot of material goodies ( i was spoiled by things) he was never the guy i could talk to about my issues. Which started piling up around puberty. 

One of these issues is ADHD and mild aspii syndrome (just got diagnosed as an adult). I was and never have been particularly neat in anything. Handwriting? Hardly legible. Locker at school? An absolute mess. But there was one category of stuff that i did organize. My creative folder. I organized them in what i admit was crazy to people who didn't understand my method (everyone). I organized them in order of importance to me. 

Now to the actual spirit crushing part. One day I was asked (for the millionth time) to clean my room. And for the first time in a very long time I did it. I'm not sure why I was able to do it that day. Maybe something good happened. I can't remember. But i remember cleaning and organizing properly everything in my room. Under my bed, my desk, made my bed, vacuumed, wiped down everything, did my laundry. I felt proud of my clean room. I was on my bed feeling great because not only did I have a clean room, but I'd done it to what i assumed was to my father's standard.  I was wrong. 

As i was on my bed feeling proud of myself, I hear stomping footsteps coming into the basement and my dad bursts into my room. Angrily. I asked him what was going on, why did he seem so upset? He ignored me and started to basically white glove my room. Which was spotless. Seeming to get angrier that he couldn't find anything he opens my closet. While i admit i didn't pay as much attention to my closet in my cleaning process, i did vacuum and organize all my shoes, snowboard, kite, rc car, and hung up all my shirts and coats. One thing i didn't touch was my creative pile. I had them ear marked in every which way, stacked so i could easily find what i looked for because i knew exactly where i put it. Turns out my dad finally found what he was looking for. Something he didn't deem clean enough. He proceeds to start yelling at me, screaming almost, and starts tearing everything out of my closet throwing everything to the floor like it was all trash. Including soon be clothing, some shoes, my kite that is had since i was six, and a fewother things. But most importantly to me was over 1000 pages of creative writing, drawings, music that i had written, thoughts i had about the world around me, etc. Thrown to the ground.

After my dad was done, I confronted him. Asking him why he had done what he had done. He got defensive saying it was my fault because i didn't organize those papers the way he wanted me to. I flared, stating he had no right to come in and just absolutely destroy my room like that. He said it was his house and could do what he wanted. 

I gave him an ultimatum after trying to explain what the pile on the floor that he had strewn about many to me. I told him ""You need to clean this up. Everything you threw to the ground means a great deal to me and i had it organized in a way i could find everything. If you do not clean it up, I will assume you don't care about anything you just did. But i warn you, if you do not clean it, i will not either. I will throw it away and i will hold you responsible for killing my creativity. And i will never forgive you for it.""

He didn't clean it up. Then he left my room. Angry, i proceeded to grab a 50 gallon garbage bag and put everything he threw to the ground like garbage into that bag, crying the whole time. I composed myself a bit then carried it upstairs. I confronted him one last time. ""This is your last chance to right the wrong you caused me."" He ignored me. So i threw it all away and it happened to be garbage day that day. It got taken before i could cool down enough to reclaim it.

I left to my only sanctuary at the time and refused to go home until i knew my father was asleep. 

I confronted him about it again about a year or two ago when he asked me why i resented him so much. After bringing up that story he tried blowing me off, but I looked at him dead in the eye and said ""It may have been nothing for you, but that was my world that you trampled on and threw to the ground. I will not even consider forgiving you until you at least apologize for it and even if you did I'm not sure I would forgive you.""

52,"Hi all,

My first post here, so please go easy on me.

For someone who has severe depression, social anxiety and chronic pain, I always seem take care of myself and my home.  For example I am always well groomed, present well and have been like that from childhood. Folks see me, including my medical team who say I look really good. I speak well.  I would not take medications that made me put on weight as I found it disgusting and preferred my depression to weight gain.  
My home is always immaculate, inside and out. So is my car.

It really concerns me as my friends/medical team at times appear to question health even though I go to hell &amp; back on a daily basis.

People say it's very odd given my health issues and diagnosis as it's not consistent with that health profile.  
Can you guys identify with this? Is it weird?

Hey,   
 

Usually I have been a pretty carefree person most of the time, but since the last time I was on holiday (1 month ago) I spent a lot of time in my bed due to sickness so I started thinking a lot about my life, and I realized a few things :  
 

I don't understand what people say to each other all the time, I'm afraid I'll get boring if I spend too much time with the same person since I'll run out of things to say and that terrifies me, especially with my girlfriend, I feel like she must get bored of me at some point  
 Lately I've started  
 

And more importantly, life is so goddamn long, I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do all those years, I've been fine for the moment because I'm only 18 and I've been living my most dense years of my life but how in hell am I goind to stay interested in things for 40 years of working (I'm going to get a degree in engineering, and I like it but 40 years is so much, and during all that time some people manage to stay together with someone and still be happy together? I'd love it but I don't think I can do this.  
 

All this makes me so anxious I'm unable to focus on the present, and I don't have the motivation to do anything. Since I've heard it so much, I know the right thing to do is see a therapist, and I can do this in about 1.5 weeks, but I don't see how anything can help me, I'm afraid this is going to stay like this forever. I also know that's probably the anxiety speaking but I'm so afraid.   
 

If you read everything up to here, thanks a lot, I only have a few questions :  
 What should I do? Can therapy really help with this? Can I try anything else in the meantime/in parallel? I'd like to go back to the time where I did not think about the future so much.   
 

Thanks again.",25Jan2019,1

Basically I am a 20yo girl, I wasnt diagnosed with borderline personality disorder yet, but my therapist thinks I have It and I am going to make an official test with her next week. My official diagnosis right now is depression/anxiety disorder and eating disorder. I read that BPD can be caused by childhood trauma. My childhood was happy at home, but when I went to kindergarten (I was 5-6yo) I was bullied by other kids. I remember them saying very bad things to me, and they marginalized me. For example they didnt want me to play with them so I was always alone even if I wanted friends. Can that be considered as a childhood trauma? The bullying continued, I was bullied and marginalized during middle school and high school and It hurt, but I started seeing a psychologist only a years ago.",25Jan2019,1
59,"Hello everyone. I'd like to start off by saying I'm writing this post as my symptoms of mental distress have now started to concern me quite a bit, and I feel like asking questions anonymously could save me from feeling extremely uncomfortable.

In short, I have been having very dark , violent , evil thoughts, which are now urges. Someone who annoys me in the slightest way, I would kill if I had the right opportunity. I would have no remorse, and would actually feel good doing it. The rage that I find inside actually makes me laugh and happy, just knowing that it's possible to do. 

I have never acted on killing someone, however as a child, these urges where there,  which I acted on, not knowing the consequences, and with no reason either. I used to get into situations where I would be alone in a pool, with another young person my age 7-8 at the time, where I began drowning them. Only to stop when I knew they were close to losing consciousness. Almost as if I just wanted to see what it's like without doing it. This happened 2-3 times. I would get into trouble , but being young it would pass as rough play in the pool gone too far, as there was no witnesses. Which I would bend the story to relieve me of blame. This type of stuff I do all the time, but not necessarily by myself. I party with people, who I constantly get too drunk. I give them more and more alcohol or drugs, knowing that it is harming them, simply because it's so amusing. I have no problems with watching them spew, green out whilst suffering physically and mentally. It is something that makes me laugh harder than ever.

I know it's wrong because I've been pulled up on it multiple times, but again I can so easily play the card of ""it was a drinking game"" and "" they chose to do it"". Which they did, but I would pressure these people, some friends, some even family. With absolutely no care for their well-being. In fact the part of them being unwell is what I wanted to happen.

I have had a  history of being sexually abused when I was young. Not raped, but being underage and shown sexual acts by someone older and mature, and basically thought I was willing. But it did extremely mess me up, especially when it come to coming to terms with my sexuality in my late teens early 20s.

I have epilepsy, which requires medications, but I've had all of these mental issues since a young age.

I've been diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder, and borderline personality disorder by a psychiatrist and psychologist. I've checked myself into hospital during a near relationship break up, thinking I would now start committing such dark thoughts.

I basically obsess about harming/killing others. It doesn't scare me, in fact it would be great to do it. Which is why I know something is really wrong. The only reason why I can't , is because of losing my relationship with my partner. But if that ends, I feel like I will be a major threat to society. I feel like I could possibly be a psychopath. But I don't necessarily fit the generalised description of one. But do have the many messed up thoughts and urges they do. 

I'm willing to answer as many questions as possible.

The goal for me is to be diagnosed correctly, so I can receive help to stop the internal suffering this is all causing. If I could understand what's wrong, and how to approach all of this, without being in trouble, or losing my job and relationship. I would definitely be able to live a somewhat normal life.",25Jan2019,1

I'm starting to feel like I might have picked up on them.. the reason I feel this is the case is, I have two different personalities, online and irl, online i fit the bill to a tea for narcissism, being a programmer I feel that people should insta respect me, etc.. etc.. but real life, I don't want anyone to know me, I just want to live life and let that be it. Even in my relationship, and I have talked with my SO about this, I would give my left nut to make her happy, just to see her smile, and I don't want anything in return, just to know she's happy is enough for me, and anytime I start to notice anything from my online side start to slip into real life, I instantly shut down and recant anything that I said that I know was in the wrong.

65,"Okay- so this is some of the most long winded drama but I don't know if it's even real or if it's just my brain making this up.  

Just some backstory about what I deal with that I think is contributing to this all- I have pretty bad anxiety and have chosen not to take medication in exchange for rigorous counselling and mindful thinking (I have chronic pain and take enough pills as it is for that).  I also have been struggling deeply with my narcissistic mother for the past few months and as a result of even that I am finding that Im not as trusting as I once was of people and their intention.  I also have this wonderful boyfriend who is so nice and loving and supportive and has a deep network of friend that I, somebody with barely any friends, enjoy spending time with.

So life was going very well, and then I think it's getting better because an old friend from highschool becomes my college roommate.  Things are fine, until my boyfriends roommate/best friend decides he likes my roommate.  Now this is fine and all, except for the fact that I literally was emotional support for his ex girlfriend during the time of their final breakup.  

The two of them had a horrible relationship where in which a lot of abuse was handed out in many different ways with some big things happening that shook the foundations of their relationship often only making things worse.  Having been there for the ex girlfriend, I distinctly remember and know I can trust the memory of her telling me to make sure that the next girl who dates him knows to watch out for these red flags- so I made sure to do my due diligence to due as such because I had promised to.

Cut to October with me standing in my kitchen with my roommate who spent a few months actually saying she thought this guy was gross and didnt like him to suddenly being deeply infatuated by him.  Im also frustrated with him at the time as he wasn't showing me the most respect and somehow we get onto the topic of him, and I make a point to say ""if you are going to get involved with him just make sure to watch out for red flags- I saw him in the last relationship he was in and he was not the best to her and she was not the best to him and I don't want that to happen to you"".  I think this is a fine thing to say- and even though he knows I said it and has been rude to me since she told him I said that I stand by that statement.  The issue arose when I further delved into a deeper topic after the ex who I helped was referred to in a negative way by my roommate.  I said something along the lines of ""well I mean that big thing happened near the end and she didn't even trust him"", my roommate says she knows what Im talking about and directly says what I am talking about, to which I respond with ""yeah, she didn't even feel comfortable enough to trust him to tell him.  It was a very big deal for her and was heartbreaking to watch.  Just be careful.""  That's where things become shaky.

So a few months later (Im talking December), this roommate has moved away and doesn't speak to me (didn't even say goodbye), and Im sitting in my bed.  I get a text message from this ex that I was friends with telling me that I shouldn't have told her anything and that it was inappropriate that I did.  I am confused- this was months ago.  Suddenly anxiety spikes and the whole thing becomes deeply stressful.  I have troubles making friends- so when a friend I do have says that I betrayed them I feel like I am loosing control over my relationships and don't know how to act at all.  I apologize and try to explain myself, and after a whole day of her telling me it's bad that I did this she finishes with a text saying that her ex (my boyfriends roommate/my old roommates new boyfriend) got the story mixed up and he really did tell my roommate before I did and I didn't spill the beans on anything and said we were good.

So that's it for actual real events- this is where my mind starts to take over and create anxieties.  

So immediately after this conflict (like two days after) this ex was supposed to come with me and a few more friends out to British Columbia for a week to hang out.  I was very excited, seeing as I haven't seen this person in a while.  Pretty understandably they don't come- but I do see pictures of them on instagram with the geotag of ""(town name) BC"" the entire time I am out there.  This is confusing me because she said she didn't want to come but there she was; just with other people.  I start to feel a mess of negative things and continue to fall into the pit of feeling like Im in the wrong and I did something irredeemable.  She said we were fine but she hasn't been speaking to me and came out here with somebody else?? 

I know that it is valid to have stresses and thoughts like that- but it was getting out of hand so I put the phone away for the rest of the trip.  

I then come home and start to go to school, and find myself with my boyfriends friends again- including this roommate of his.  I can't help but feel this all consuming tension with him to the point where I can't be alone in a room with him.  Now that I know all of the venting I did to my old roommate got out to him, it's very clear that he knows Im not his biggest fan and it shows in his behaviour from my perspective.  He is doing things like cutting me off, not speaking to me for long periods of time even though I spend a large amount of time at his house and around him, and even ostracizing me from the other friends of my boyfriend.  I spoke to my boyfriend about it, and he said that his roommate must not be aware that he is doing anything.  This has sent me into a deep position of discomfort around him, and is now even stretching out to others in this small community.

A friend that moved away just travelled into town to visit, and I did spend some time with him.  This friend is also friends with the ex, and is pretty consistently aware of every emotion that the ex has seeing as she vents to him a lot (which is fine and allowed).  The only issue is because of that, I feel like I was spoken about and I don't know what was said.  This got to a point of spiralling out of control in my head of just pure thoughts of thinking that he hates me because he knows what I did.  He is gone now, and I am still stuck here with this paranoia that everyone hates me because I did something so wrong and betrayed such a deep trust.  

Oh yeah, and it came to a head when a joke was made about the tv that the ex left.  I laughed and in response said ""well, actually she said I could have it"".  To this the roommate says ""oh she said it was my tv now. Guess she didn't tell you.  Makes sense.""

I still havent heard anything from the ex, or from my old roommate (who is supposed to be coming into town today- actually).

I feel like a wreck over all of this and have no idea how to handle it. Ill probably bring it up at my next session, but I haven't really told anybody about this narrative of everybody being in on hating me yet that I know my brain is making up but I felt it would be good to vent about it.  I also wanted to let people who deal with thoughts like these know that they are not alone and that I can promise I will always like them no matter what and that I understand how thoughts like that happen.  

If anybody has any advice on if I should message this ex in the meantime and talk to her about this feelings to just clear everything up or if I should just leave it and try to ignore it Id welcome the discourse- this has really been tearing me apart lately. 

Thank you",25Jan2019,1

67,"My heart palpitations leave me breathless and shocked for a split-second repeatedly. They totally disrupt whatever I'm doing, and it's frustrating me.

Doctors are saying I'm okay, that it's just my mental disorder. They're not saying anything specific or giving me any meds for heart problems. I'm on a couple of mental health meds, though. For depression, schizophrenia, and I guess anxiety.

The problem is that they're very distracting. They start only when I'm focused on a mentally draining or stimulating task, such as thinking or learning something. I'm currently trying to get into game development, and it seems impossible to do due to my heart and the other problems.

My heart palpitations have a concrete beginning. Basically, I was lying in my bed and playing OldSchool RuneScape. Then I got scared due to something. My laptop was on my chest/stomach. I jumped up, and it obviously elevated my blood pressure along with the fear/shock I had. Then I felt a painful, hard thump in my chest. Afterwards it was difficult to breathe for days, and I started having near-constant heart palpitations that disrupted my sleep.

The heart palpitations have greatly lessened now, but they're still obviously there. I haven't had any palpitations while lying down anymore, only while sitting or walking around.

I just don't know what to do about them. They make it impossible to do any kind of mental work.

My life is doomed to be shit. Everything just piles up, and it's honestly making me borderline suicidal. I'll just end up homeless or dead in my 20s-30s. I'm 23.

75,"About two weeks ago my (28M) girlfriend(30’s F) had a seizure on the train where she was traveling from Beaumont to California. They dumped her at a hospital in El Paso. So I drove out there from Houston to pick her up.

On the way back, her mom, who is ridiculously codependent, insisted on me bringing her back to their house which is in the middle of nowhere and way out of my way and would have added more than two hours to my already long travel time. 
She has had seizures from a long time but they haven’t been able to figure out how to control them. None of the anti-convulsants medications work. 

So we spend time in the hospital because of her seizures 2-3 times a month.

But I’ve been able to handle all of that pretty ok. This week, we found out that my dad has cancer in the base of his throat called chondrosarcoma. It is in the advanced stages. There are multiple surgeries he will have to do and they are all very sensitive. 

My younger brother, who has been with his high school girlfriend for the last 8 years (they have two kids together) are breaking up and might be moving back in here with my two nieces.

But doing stuff for others when I'm upset doesn't make me feel any better. If anything, it makes me more stressed, even if I'm told how grateful they are for helping them.

Yet despite all this, no one thinks I'm a terrible person. But I know I am. I want good things to happen to me, and always want my way despite what everyone else thinks. Knowing this. Wouldn't the world be better off without me? I mean, no one likes a selfish immature person, and I dont blame them.",25Jan2019,1
80,"background info: i have bipolar disorder and OCD, very early onset. i’ve been hospitalized and have taken now two semesters off school because of my illness. i’m on multiple medications. 

i (21f) have made a huge revelation of what my central, life problem is: i want to run before i can crawl. i want to jump ahead in everything in life. i want to go ahead and be where i want to be without the patience, learning, or growing i need to get there. 

it’s made me be a drain on my boyfriend, who has loved and supported me with great patience as long as we’ve been together, he is my angel, and i know the effect my depression has had on him. he is so strong and he is my rock. and i made him a promise as serious as a heart attack: i will NOT be toxic. i will NOT be a drain, i will NOT put aside his needs for my small issues that i will now learn how to handle myself, i WILL support him in his work and dreams instead of putting my little wants over his really great path forward in school, work, and streaming. 

it’s taken me a year and a half in therapy, but i did it. i’ve found what’s been the plague i let grow inside me. 

i am ready to enter this new phase with this revelation. i am excited and confident and motivated to move forward knowing this information. i am ready to be a healthy girlfriend. i’m ready to be a loving daughter. i’m ready to be a supportive friend. i am ready to be good to myself and love myself and do my best in all i do, for myself and for others.

Well this year i decided to try to change that. I forced myself to do things, to test my negative thoughts. I mean are they real or just in my head? But after all the things i did, it didn't make me feel good at all. I feel ashamed, kinda. Like disgusted.


For example, my friends and i planned to go out today. I usually just wear a tshirt. But this time i tried wearing my nicer clothes. I tried talking more to them (i usually am quiet). After the night ends, i feel disgusted with myself. Like, wtf am i doing? This has happened more than once. I'm just kinda confused, i thought i was doing the right thing for me.

Does anyone have any way to help with not losing it while going back over these? I am currently locked in the bathroom and walk circles reliving these terrible incidents that I write down. 

It's like my brain normally goes so fast into panicing/anxiety or being paranoid about something new each day and seeing these I just get flooded with emotions and these voices just tell me about how much I screwed up that day

87,"A story I found from 2013. A grad student at the University of Georgia named Kristin Harbaugh had been undergoing counseling with Andrew Stochel. After a while she stopped seeing him, and started seeing a psychiatrist instead. One day, weeks after Stochel had last seen Harbuagh,  Harbaugh's husband called Stochel and told him that Harbaugh needed to go to the hospital. Stochel executed a ""Form 1013"" (Georgia's version of the Baker Act or 5150, etc) and falsely certified that he had personally examined Harbaugh within the past 48 hours. 

The Athens Clarke County police arrived to apprehend Harbaugh, but after speaking with her they concluded that she did not pose a danger to herself or others, and declined to arrest her. They informed Stochel of their decision. Stochel THEN contacted the University Police, who went to Harbaugh's apprehend, handcuffed her, and transported her to a hospital.

The judge ruled that Stochel qualified for ""good faith immunity"" even though he LIED on the form. A mental health worker who has not examined you in person, in the last 48 hours, is not permitted to execute a warrant for your arrest. This is so disturbing to me. They really treat us like we aren't human and have no rights whatsoever. If a police officer was caught falsifying an arrest warrant, don't you think something would happen?

My mother(52) and I(16) live alone in Poland. For the past two and a half years she has believed that she is being targeted by a global surveillance network. It has steadily worsened to the point where she believes 99% of people to have some affiliation with this organization. This includes all family and friends, including my sister and I. She believes these agents to take pictures of her and write reports about her for money. She will get triggered at the sight of me using a phone, blinking/looking in the wrong direction or at another person, or looking at her, or simply my response to a question. Once this occurs she can become angry and yell or insist on asking questions, or occasionaly enters my room at night and wakes me to discuss something. On a few occasions she did physically hurt my sister and I. She has lost all her friendships and hobbies and interests, and is scared of doing anything out of fear that it will all be monitored and used to ruin her. She has stated that she would commit suicide if I weren't her responsibility.

My family has had trouble finding a solution in the past, as she believed her mind to be sound and vastly superior to any other persons, and that any psychologist or professional would only lie to her and attempt to destroy her. It has gotten severe enough where I think it is best if she is institutionalized without her consent, and I move in with nearby family. I am scared and confused, and unsure if this is possible to accomplish and if so, what I would do later?

89,"(I can't explain it too well, so if anyone has any questions/concerns just ask in the comments. Sorry in advance.)
For about two years, maybe a little less, I've been having this weird need of love (?)
what I mean is that no matter how much anyone loves me, it's still too little to me. I constantly 'dream' about having an older partner to feel safe and loved by. It's not exactly dreaming, I just feel like I need that to ever be happy in my life. Like it's the ultimate goal of my life. It's the only thing that matters for me. Of course, since I'm a teenager some might think it's just that excitement and curiosity about having a boyfriend or something. Well, not really. I don't want a boyfriend. I'm interested in people around the age 20-30, which isn't too old, but it still seems off since I'm 15. I'm mostly talking about hugs and although I know it sounds weird I am basically addicted to them, being hugged is the only way I can release my stress and everyone who knows me at least little bit knows how much I love them, I could cuddle with people 24/7. But it seems more like an obsession than love. I behave like a dog waiting to get its' treat. 
My dad has been basically... absent, for my whole life. He was either kilometers away 5 days a week, or busy with work, then going out with friends or now, after my parents divorced about 1,5 years ago - having his own life, sometimes talking with me, mostly as if we were a bit distanced friends. He loves me of course, it's just that he has his own life and things he loves... more. 
I've also had depression for few years now, I don't know if it might have anything to do with it. 
I don't understand what's happening, my mum loves me dearly, my dad isn't and has never been abusive in any way. It's as if I had some kind of daddy issues but purely emotionally(?)
Is there any way I can stop this, or any direction I can go for to get help?

90,The other day I learned what intrusive thoughts were from reddit.  An /r/askreddit thread asked about them and I learned it was normal.  However Is thinking about a bad memory from the past an example of intrusive thoughts or do intrusive thoughts have to be in the present?

91,"I was never a hard-woking kid but I still managed to get good grades in school because I was witty and I'd pick up on things fast. In fact, I finished HS with an average of 9.3/10, which is pretty good imo. I'm not here to brag, I'm here just to state a fact and let you know that it's been quite difficult for me ever since I graduated HS. So hard that I failed my 1st year in college.

The experience made me realize I do not have a good work ethic at all, but I don't know how to change that. I'm incredibly unmotivated. I simply do not care to put any work into my studies anymore. If I don't like it, I won't do the thing. That's just who I've grown to be and it sucks.

But for a long time I couldn't because my adhd and anxiety and depression made it very difficult to concentrate. I would only be able to read a few pages at a time before I'd lose focus and it was really making me feel awful.

I'm on a new medication for adhd (non-stimulant, it's just like blood pressure medicine) but it's made a huge difference. I've read 3 full books in the past month and i'm so excited about it. I'm halfway through my 4th book now :)",25Jan2019,1
93,"I'm 23 years old. I'm in a long-term relationship of over 3 years. I've never physically cheated on my girlfriend nor have I ever had a problem being faithful in any of my relationships other than this catfishing behavior. I love my girlfriend and our relationship is great. I do struggle with depression but that's the only diagnosis I have ever received. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lately I have become infatuated by certain people. Sometimes it's because they're attractive, sometimes it's because they're very nice to me, and sometimes I just can't pinpoint why I feel suddenly infatuated with them. I can have 0 feelings towards someone one day and then a month later be in a mental state where I can't stop thinking about them. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I become infatuated with someone I get their phone number.  I either buy their phone number from spokeo, go through a mutual contact's phone when they're asleep to get it, or look for it on social media. Then I use a texting app to reach out to them. I try to convince them that I'm an old classmate, neighbor, coworker, etc. I tell them how beautiful they are and if they're interested in chatting and meeting up for some drinks. It only lasts for a day or two at the most and then I delete the app and never contact them again because obviously I can't meetup since I'm not the person in the photos. When someone rejects my catfish persona or ignores me I feel really hurt and depressed for a while. I have done this to about 7 people in the last few months. I think it's only a matter of time til either my girlfriend catches me or someone else figures it's me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's wrong of me to do this because I am in a relationship. I have felt guilt but it wasn't until recently I realized how creepy this behavior is.

I have dealt with anxiety and depression on my own, trying hard to not let it show so I could avoid any criticism and judgement.

Constantly causing arguments between my fiancé and I, and causing me to leave work early or sometimes not even show up at all.  

The hardest part is talking about it. Always feeling hopeless and on the verge of giving up entirely. Always thinking that if I talk, who would even care to listen.

Yes, that game. [If you are not familiar click here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_(mind_game))

Other things that are important to note: I am a long time drug addict and alcoholic. I am mostly clean now as use can make my symptoms unbearable.

Here we go: Sometimes when I am hanging around friends or other people, we are having a conversation I think people are playing a game with me. They will say one thing but I process two. I get it in my head that they are verbally attacking me. I think that I am supposed to attack back, but when this switch turns on I mostly get scared and clam up. It is like a power struggle to see who is the most enlightened, or something like that, I really don't know. 

I've recently read about [ideas of reference](https://psychcentral.com/encyclopedia/ideas-of-reference/) which seem highly related at this point. I experience this frequently, and have typical signs like people on television and radio talking specifically to me. This relates to this nightmare I've been living as anything someone says to me, my brain rewrites into something relating to my life.

I've always treated this as a psychic gift, or a rebirth of lost consciousness from before our species had language to communicate. Lately was the first time I've been able to take a step back and realize these may be delusions. Part of delusions are being steadfast in your beliefs

I've texted friends after these encounters and said things like ""I've told you I don't like that game."" I've always been told the same thing, they say sorry if I had my feelings hurt somehow but they weren't doing anything intentionally and that they'd never hurt me.

For some reason I believe to bring up, to ask people if they are messing with me, ask if they feel this too, that is a sin and they will never admit to it. Thinking or talking about it is how you lose the game after all.

This is all in my head. I've researched intensely with little results. I just want to find others who suffer from this specifically. The closest example I've found is an amazing essay on ""language games and psychosis"":

""My own experience of paranoia can be succinctly described using language games. Effectively, my paranoia consisted of the idea that everyone was playing language games and that the object that people were referring to for certain words was me.""

I don't drink alcohol because of things from the past which involved some members of my family and I don't go to bars or other such establishments. The thing is because of this I am frequently looked down upon by my other colleagues who go to pubs to have beer and such things and I always head straight home, because that's what I want. Most of the time it is a real joy to work with them, but after the shift ends, all I really want is to head home. That makes them see me like I'm breaking the group and generally that I do not want them as friends.

So I got to the point where I'm considering to leave.

And also there is this teambuilding in a vineyard in spring and I really don't want to go. Simply because I don't want to be surrounded by alcohol and drunk colleagues and also because I want to spend my time with the person I love.

110,"  I wanted to share my thoughts about anti-depressants. I speak on this topic because it is something that I know first-hand; I know what I’m talking about. 

I over-heard someone tell another person leaving the doctors office that “Drugs are a crutch”. Well, maybe that statement is true, maybe not. For me, its’ a part of my day, like taking vitamins in the morning. It’s just another thing I do that’s helps me be a better me.  

Crutch!? If you break your leg, you might need to use crutches, till you are able to recover to the point you don’t need them. If you have high blood pressure, you would take a medication for that. It wouldn’t be the only action that you would take, you would be told to get out and be more active. Also true advice for depression. Anti-depressants is a part of someone’s help with depression. Other actions will help; therapy, physical activity, personal and possibly spiritual growth. What we need is different for everyone, and what might be needed at one point in your life might not be what’s needed at a different time, but these are some of the basics that a lot of people find helpful.  

Personally, I seriously a taking my life for the first time over 40 years ago. I was to young for anti-depressants and options didn’t really exist. I would have been given a drug that kept me from wanting to hurt myself but kept me from being me and living a meaningful life. Today, there is so much more choices and knowledge.  

My advice:

Find a doctor who knows what they are doing, either a psychiatrist or a really well-trained doctor. You want to find the best doctor you can; it’s your mind, after all. After you find someone, take their advice, but keep in mind. The person who knows best about what’s happening is you. If you don’t like the effect it’s having, talk to your doctor. They have many different choices, and sometimes it takes a combination of more than one; It does for me. I think the goal is to help you, not to make you not feel like yourself. 

Good luck – and good thoughts.",25Jan2019,1

I didn't freak out, maybe sobbed a little from time to time but nothing dramatic, I just wanted to hear his point of view on why he would do that. I even joked about it to both of them!

So we spent hours talking, and when he went to sleep I cut myself. But since then I realised that fag burns are much better because they're less messy. I did it literally behind my exes back once, and once when I was extremely sad at the pub. It feels like having a coffee in the morning. All emotions released. I don't know if I'll stop.

I think I'm also drawn to it because the only attention I remember getting from my dad is when I would 'misbehave' and he would hurt me.
