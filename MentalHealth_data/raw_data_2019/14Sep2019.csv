1,"I went through a rough life honestly... addict parents, taking care of a drunk dad that chose crack and heroin over me, diagnosed with PTSD by a therapist when I was 6 because of my abusive parents, my birth mom dying from alcoholism when I was 9, losing 2 other aunts to death from alcoholism, dropping out at 16, having heart and lung condition and having a stroke at 18 and a month later my long term girlfriend leaving me for someone else when I was just recovering. When I finally got a good job I got a car that I could afford at the moment, but then quit my job unexpectedly because my mom started to develop paranoia and delusions and had to break into the bathroom and wrestle a knife from her to stop her from killing herself, and my job wouldn’t let me use my sick time to watch her until she could get better care, so I quit, and I had my own hospital visits for my health, and fell behind and lost my car last year and went into debt. I moved in with my best friend 2 years ago who has done so much for me. He knows the things I’ve been through. I almost lost my leg last year from another clot, had to have leg surgery and had to be out of work and fell behind, causing me to owe him 800 on rent which I’ve been slowly paying off. Lately, everything has been getting harder and harder. This week seems to have been what pushed me over the edge. Most of my day and money is spent on transportation and then the rest bills. 2 hours to get to work, 3 hours to get home. With my heart condition walking in the heat is too much for me. Power at work has been going out everyday. Yesterday was my 22nd birthday and I didn’t do anything but work and wait at work for 2 hours for my ride to come. Most people didn’t even remember it. I hate my birthday, I feel lonely every year and think about my childhood and past and how much those birthdays sucked too. Everyone kept asking what I was doing for my birthday. I did have plans, and my friends cancelled on me. I don’t have much friends these days because most of them just want to stay out at bars and get drunk and with my addiction history in my family I can’t, so now I don’t go out much. I couldn’t stop crying once I locked up at work. I finally lost it this year. I came home and I told my friend I was in pain and I kept bawling my eyes out. I’m so mentally and physically exhausted. He just got a new classic mustang his dream car, so he was going to sell me his old Honda, but after doctors appointments a lot of my savings was gone. He has to get rid of his old car ASAP because it isn’t insured. And I told him I could pay for my insurance and registration and give him whatever cash I have left (he’s selling it to me for 1300) and give him higher payments a month to pay it off. He said he just couldn’t do it. And he’s selling it to another friend that has all money in hand. And this guy has so much more going for him and it just made me so angry. That I have to see this guy driving around with this car that I was supposed to get. And that I’m going to continue struggling everyday for I don’t know how long because I’m losing more and more money and I just lost it. I yelled at him and told him I didn’t get it. I told him he knows how much I’m struggling and just need to get back on my feet and that it wasn’t a gift. And I know it’s not his fault now. And I get it. But in the moment I was so angry. He had to walk away to get ready for work, and as soon as he left I threw my shoes and I threw something else (not at him, just once he left to take a shower, not thinking he’d hear me) but I guess he heard it, or maybe it was just awkward I got angry with him at all because in our entire friendship we’ve never fought. He awkwardly and quietly said “bye see you later”  when he was going out the door and I was just sitting. As soon as he left completely I let everything out. I punched the wall a few times, and I threw probably 10 empty glass beer bottles from recycling until they broke and shattered everywhere and just threw everything. I wanted to hurt myself. Not him, just myself. I haven’t acted out that way in years. Usually I can cope. This past month I’ve seriously contemplated ending it all. But I think about my best friend and I think about the sliver of hope that something might change, but it’s all pain. I’m so afraid of myself that I acted out the way I did tonight. I was so angry and heated, I don’t know what’s going to come next for me. I gave myself until the end of September to get a car and fix my life, and now I don’t know. Now I feel like I’m going to lose my best friend he’s like a brother to me and the most of a family I’ve ever had and it just adds on to everything else. I wouldn’t blame him if he never wanted to talk to me again. I did all of this after just earlier today he told me we could spend Christmas together, because my family just told me they don’t know if I could visit them for Christmas because they have plans to go somewhere else, leaving me alone. And then I freaked out like this tonight. And he’s never seen me angry like this. I’m so fucking exhausted. I recently started getting closer to my dad and he got clean 2 years ago, when I was 20 and already moved out. Why couldn’t he do it when I still lived there and I needed him? Why couldn’t he do it before I was permanently damaged? It makes me so angry. It feels like I’ve finally reached the point where it’s all too much and yeah I coped and I dealt with a lifetime of pain but now it feels like I just can’t anymore. I used to let it out aggressively, and then I just talked it out over the years, and tonight it all went backwards from all my progress. I’m losing it. I don’t know what to do. I’m so fucking lonely, and sad, and scared, and I feel like a loser. There’s so much fucking pain. I feel like nothing is ever going to feel okay. I just want to down a bunch of oxys and booze and lock myself away from everyone and just cry for hours.",14Sep2019,6

3,"So I found out I'm pregnant with my second about a month and a half ago. My doctor and I decided that I stop taking my antidepressants (took them for anxiety, depression and ptsd). I am a superrrrr sensitive person; like I will be sad for weeks or months if something unfortunate happens to me and I cant snap out of it. Anyways, now that my mind is able to run free again, I feel like I'm in this constant state of hopelessness and discouragement and just utter disappointment in myself that I thought I was doing better than I am. I thought i was recovered, turns out I'm not and I'm really struggling with the realization that I am, maybe, unfixable. I am taking care of myself so I dont feel like I'm completely back into the depression but I just cant stop with these uncomfortable, deep feelings. If anyone has dealt with this before and successfully snapped out of it, please feel free to give me some much needed advice and guidance! Even if you can just relate and dont have advice, it's much needed. I just need to feel not so alone.",14Sep2019,1
4,"Hey, guys. First post, gonna be long, never mind the throwaway. First things first; I’m not in crisis. I’m safe and okay; I recently started therapy, even. But I have something I’d like feedback on that I’m not sure I want to tell my therapist yet; some thoughts on myself that I’ve never talked about with anyone. Too scared of the answers until recently, honestly. 

For background, I have depression, anxiety, and ADHD primarily inattentive type. 28 F, married. BA in psychology.

I constantly think about what I look like to other people; every moment, every day. It’s like I’m living my life in third person, watching a rough cut of a film. I feel like an actor critiquing my own performance. Even when I’m trying to be honest and emotionally vulnerable, I still feel it. I worry that this is emotionally manipulative; that I’m trying to achieve a specific effect with everything I say. To be fair, I’m not usually successful, so at least there’s that. Is this just social awareness and I’m overthinking it? Is there something seriously fucked up about this? Does this phenomenon have a name?

I recognize the danger of armchair psychology, but seriously, armchair shrink away. I’m not worried about the psychological equivalent of the webMD effect; I don’t intend to self-diagnose, and I’ll talk to my therapist about it eventually. I’m only two sessions in, and we have more concrete things to work on right now. I just keep gnawing at it this afternoon and thought it might help to get it out in the open, even anonymously. I’ve always been much too scared to talk about it in case it’s a Pandora’s box I’m not ready for. I think holding it back might be doing more harm than good, though.

Thanks in advance, and sorry for the length. If you have any questions or need more info, I’m an open book.",14Sep2019,1

6,"Hey r/mentalhealth, I need some advice. I hope this is the right place to post this!

Over the past 3 years I have noticed a significant personality change in myself. I was once a 'life of the party' free spirited person. Many people looked up to me and saw value in me. I gave myself freely to the world. After a rough few years (including a massive breakup and losing my dream job) I have a serious mental block on happiness. I find it difficult to enjoy anything. My friends have noticed this and distance themselves from me (like the person they loved isn't there anymore..) Its very difficult to connect with people since I genuinely feel no emotions towards anyone anymore. I was once such an emotionally connected person, now I focus almost solely on the things that get me by (like work and school)

I have taken ssris/spoken to counselors for some short periods of time and have noticed no difference in my lack of feeling. There is also a constant pressure on the top of my head that seems to prevent me from thinking effectively/clearly

What's going on here? Any advice on what I can do to feel better?",14Sep2019,1

8,"Having just recently moved away from using FB again,  I started to take a deeper look at some of the residual feelings associated with posting and participating in social media via FB. 

Facebook censored many of my atheist-friendly pages, leaving me feeling further isolated from a group of potentially like-minded (or open-minded) people. Facebook also prevented a certain comedian from posting dubbed videos (Tony Baker, anyone?), leaving me to find him on Instagram. This is some of the more personal, yet still superficial aspects of my time on FB, yet the feeling I left with was usually the same each time I closed the window; regret.

I couldn’t quite figure out why I felt this way exactly, and it didn’t seem directly connected to any one instance or interaction. 

Facebook is riddled with ads, designing pages based on your feed for you and, observably, designed to keep you scrolling; almost like an addict.

I believe the craving is for confirmation, from others or from the self.

I won’t ramble too much, but the point here is that after leaving FB, I’m feeling generally less regret.

If you have a FB account, consider leaving it alone for a week; maybe even a month. I believe the social media we choose to engage in can have a very intense effect on our emotional state, and through experience, FB leaves somewhat of an unfulfilled, negative impression.

Reddit is responsible for providing me with a positive, relevant, consistent medium for information, interaction and simple pleasures. Maybe, someone will read this and leave FB for a while. Hopefully, it helps as well with any mental issues they may be experiencing.

I’m an undergrad of UNM with a degree in psychology, spent the last few years working with adolescents in psychiatric settings; just for more perspective on me.

For anyone that reads this and feels as though social media is having a negative impact on your emotional state, I urge you to take a break; it may very well help and I sincerely hope it does. 👍🏼",14Sep2019,3
9," I posted yesterday about my daughter, who called the police yesterday for suicidal thoughts:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/d3lfrq/daughter\_in\_the\_hospital\_for\_suicidal\_thoughts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/d3lfrq/daughter_in_the_hospital_for_suicidal_thoughts/) 

Today I found her, and have been able to call her on their phone. They had a psychiatrist and a social worker talk to her, and apparently the social worker told her places she can go once her 72 hour hold is over (tomorrow), but she can't remember anything. They gave her a pill to take, but she doesn't know what it is.

She said they only have one group per day. Today it was anger management, and she went, but the conversation got derailed. Once in a while they come and take her vitals, and it seems like that's it. She's been asking for paper and a pencil and doodling. There's nothing else to do but watch tv.

Taking her in was immediate help, because she didn't hurt herself. She's still alive. I don't know how much good the rest is doing, though. She sounds calm, and that scares me. I'm afraid that when they let her go, she might hurt herself so she doesn't have to go back.

I've called her a few times already and talked to her on the phone, but there's not much to say and I don't know if I'm helping. She wants to talk to me, but I'm not sure what to say. It sounds like they're just holding her, watching her, not treating her.

Have you ever been in that situation? Have you been hospitalized? Is the being watched helpful?",14Sep2019,1
10,"Lately I've been feeling like a worthless piece of shit because of how I treated my friends. I made a mistake and I can't undo it. I lost my best friend I've known for 9 years, a few of my other friends don't want to hang out anymore. And right know I want to end it all, cause I have no one anymore I can't stand living right now, so I decided that I'm going to commit suicide, my plan is to jump in front of a train tonight because it's probably the least painful way I can kill myself and I have tracks near where I live.",14Sep2019,1
11,"Idk if I'm a normal person or a little fucked in the head honestly I feel like both. Basically I'm an 18 year old dude still figuring out what I want to do but that's sort of unrelated I guess. People say I'm really mature for my age and I've been told that for as long as I remember but I'm a completely different person inform of my friends, direct family, in direct family, co workers etc etc but that doesn't seem too out of the ordinary. I dont know where to start off but I guess I guess I'll start off with my emotions.

I dont feel much but I always have a lingering sense of anger, sadness or shame along with my normal neutralnus sort of say. I dont feel many good emotions but I can still have a good time if that makes any sense. I hate to say it but love for family members and friends is barely felt iether but I still worry and I know that if anything happens to any of then I'd be destroyed and I'm worrying about a few people right now, so I know I must love these people but I dont feel it much     every good emotion I have is stale as old bread but u still laugh and have the ability to be concerned. I dont know if this is normal, or if I have an issue.

I also lose interest in everything I do though I do keep up and revisit old hobbies while learning and dropping new ones. Music is my life but st the same time I dont gain much joy for it. I've never been interested in finding a girlfriend or having sex or whatever iether and my drive to do anything eventually stops no matter how intrigued i could be at one time.

I do have suicidal thoughts though I know I'd never go through with them i talk about how i dont fear death and at some points welcome it although i know that i would be scared if i had a gun to my head, got sick etc... I get the smallest cut and I'm that worried about it getting infected. I also fear that if there is a hekin or hell I'd be going to Hell and cant accept the fact that if someone cant help not being convinced that there is a god that they'll suffer for eternity after death and that's inflicted by an all loving god.

When people pass away I dont feel alot of remorse but I want to. I also worry alot about what certain people think about me sometimes and my image but I dont worry too much about my health because sometimes I drink a 12 pack of beer at night and I eat chips and whatever else. I have trouble sleeping some times and no matter how long I sleep I cant feel well rested and I'm tired all day.

I've suffered between 4-7 concussions maybe more during my child hood 2 of them the last few years. I have had some traumatic pshychadelic experiences with marijuana while I was in high school and I use to drink til I'd puke every weekend. Lastly I know that this has nothing to do with my health but I forgot to mention this in my emotions section (if you will) but I'm always in my head my mind doesnt shut up wether it's a stupid song, making up theorys about life, death, trying to work around somthing in my head, creating problems or conflicts with people and how they will turn  out planning out crimes I know I'm never going to commit episodes or ideas for shows like the office, family guy or south park I think could be funny  book ideas music ideas career ideas, everything wrong with the modern average life and society etc.

Idk I feel stuck, fucked In the head, everything constantly feels like a dream, I get pissed off way too easy mainly with family, I have visual snow that stresses me out , I think my hair is falling out lol idk I feel like I need advise, a diagnosis of some sort, other peoples ideas or insight idk.

I never went outside, I cut school, etc. I’ve tried committing suicide for really stupid reasons, mainly boys. So I’m not really sure that this should even go in this post but whatever. I’m in my 8th grade year and I’ve been feeling so off. I’ve had an extreme loss of appetite (basically eating very small portions of food, or getting a stomach ache from things I do eat/drink), mood swings (One class I can be upbeat and happy, but then 2 periods later I can feel absolutely nothing, until I go to sleep and wake up for the next day). I often come home from school with no more “juice” left in me. I’m just blank until I get some rest. I don’t really smile, or talk, or really react to anything. I’m always tired, I can sleep for upwards of 12 hours every day. Everything thing in my life is okay. I don’t really have a relationship with my father anymore due to previous abuse, but he still tries to wiggle his way in, only to criticize me. My mother has been talking to my sister about wanting me to see a therapist. I feel kind of betrayed. I’ve always hated the idea of going to therapy, even after my overdoses, I’ve just thrown up some and refused to go to the hospital.

Everyone was making fun of me and i didnt notice it... 
Then i got into weed (1 year ago) and it helped me  a lot because i dont feel that much alone when im stoned, at first some people smoked with me and i thought i could gain friends because of that but it wasnt like that, i got addicted because i felt a lot better (im not smoking everyday but 3-4 times a week for sure)and then these ""friends"" started to talk shit about me although theyre smoking as well and arent better than me...
Then after hollydays i went to school and nobody wanted to have anything to do with me, when there was only one place left next to a ""friend of mine"" they told me to go away, nobody wants to sit next to me, nobody talks to me in the breaks and everytime i hear someone talking about me theyre laughing. 
I just feel so empty, i hate myself so much and i dont know how to change, when im alone, lying in bed i just want to hug someone but im pretty sure that ill never get a girlfriend or smth...

He has pretty severe episodes and doesnt go to therapy nor take medication.

Her and I both work from 10am-9pm today and it is around 7:30 our time as I write this. At around 10:30 this morning, she was on the phone with him while he was ""having a meltdown."" We work retail so we need to be ready when a guest is coming in. This meant that she essentially had to hang up on him in the middle of all of this.

She called back after she was done with her customer and went straight to voicemail. She has been calling and leaving messages just about every 10 minutes since 11:30 this morning. 

The main concern is that he's committed suicide.

He has their only vehicle and is supposed to pick her up from work tonight. I've told her that if he doesnt show to call me and I would come and take her home and wait for the cops if need be. 

I will not let her enter the home first if we show up to the vehicle in the driveway. If he's done what we think he may have, I don't want her to see him that way.

Being the ""man"" in the situation, I'll be going in first if need be. Is this a good idea? Should we call the police instead? Should she be the one to find him? If I'm the one to find him, what then?

22,"So my cousin thinks that I should try going back to a therapist to help with some of my mental issues, but I'm not entirely convinced. I've been to counselors and therapists before and the amount of help was minimal at best. 

I've had issues with depression and anxiety since probably high-school (I'm now 28). My parents and home-life was great but I had few friends because I am odd and was especially odd as child. I'm still not great at social interactions. The thing is, I like people, I'm honestly more of an extrovert, but I am awkward and have trouble reading subtleties in conversations and figuring out how to respond to people sometimes. 

Growing up the school counselors didn't really think anything was too seriously wrong because my grades and test scores were good even if I wasn't happy.   

I'm going to be moving to a new city for work in a few months and that has me nervous because it means starting all over on building a social network. It takes me a long time to find and make friends.

I feel like I’m close, but people can tell there is something just a little off.  I can’t tell in situations if I should be happy, sad, scared, angry, confused, confident, or anything. 

I have been in therapy for years and I use a lot of mental energy and brainpower to try and keep things “together” or on track, but every day I feel more confused and lost.

24,"hello (16m). How you ever been big chillin on a friday night and you check social media (snap, insta) and you see ALL your friends doing something else. Im 6'2 185lbs, i swim and im damn good at it. If you know anything about swimming you know it requires alot of dedication and its very specialized. Last night (thursday) i told my mom i was going to hang with friends but 1 arguement later i convinced myself she wanted me to go to practice (3:30-6:30). I went and no one was there except the ususal kids who show up on a friday. One of my really good friends who i talk to alot about these things showed up. Practice was canceld early because of thunderstorms. We talked alot about introspection. I know i am truly a shitty person and i am trying to fix this. I didnt eat anything today, i have horrible dyphoria when i comes to my body (i know, i swim in a speedo). I look at my fat fucking stomach in the mirror and i wish it was gone and so i starve myself. i have neurocardiogenic syncope, so not eating fucked with my heart big time. I was really out of it this pracitce. I never looked anyone in the eye. i have had these phases of ""depression before"". The end of last season i would sit in my car and cry for about an hour because i was so isolated because i swim distance and no one else does on my team so i just swim by myself while i can see my friends and cant speak to them. i told all this to my coach and he knows my sensitivity and my mental state. At the end of practice he said i looked down and he wanted to talk to me, so i just told him i wanted to hang with friends but couldnt. Basiclly i blew him off. When i got home i went straight upstairs to see if anyone i knew was online. some of my friends were but they wouldnt respond to me when we were talking cause they were playing league. I then checked social media, i saw so many stories of people having a fun time living it up and i just feel like shit cause even my ""loser friends"" are having fun, without me. Ive tried to have some human interaction tonight but everything ive tried has failed. this is like the 6th time in a row. i normally just listen to music and contemplate or cry but im sick of it. I have nothing to do. im so lonely. i went into public discord servers and aksed people if they wanted to talk but no one took me seriously. My father has horrible anxiety and depression issues, my mother has told me stories. I dont know if stuff like that carries down through the family like that. In english class, we are discussing the cather in the rye and our teacher was talking about spiralling into insanity and holdens (main character) decent into it. A lot of the symptoms of it i have been feeling lately. I have work on sunday and i just don't feel it. I just want to talk to someone and talking to boomers who dont give a rats ass about me doesnt help.  i feel so alone, i just want to talk to somone who wont change my life because of all of this. im suprised about me not falling for some girl. Knowing myself and how desperate for love and affection so i dont kill myself, i havent, as of recent fallen for someone. Talking to some online person doesnt help either. i want regular human conversation, not some robot talking to me about my mental health like they care. I havent really been thinking about offiing myself, im very realistic, but i have been really out of it as of recent

25,"This year my depression has been really rough. I don't take any meds for it, I was actually on Lexapro for anxiety but got off of it because it was causing suicidal thoughts. Those have since then been non existent. Yesterday I was crying really hard and my bf came in the bedroom and asked what was wrong, why I was crying. When I tried explaining, it was like he wasn't realy listening and just adding retorts, making me feel even worse and not wanting to talk about it anymore. I need to talk to someone about my depression, and I see a therapist once a week, but there's times I want to talk about it when I'm currently in the depressive moment. I don't have many friends (what friends I do have I don't talk to about my depression or anxiety), and I don't have any close family besides my parents, but when I talk to them about how I feel, it seems to ruin my relationship with my bf (they accuse him of why I feel down). Any help please?? Suggestions of who I can talk to, or how to talk to my bf about this stuff?",14Sep2019,7
26,"I take Venlafaxine, one of the side effects that I've experienced with all of the many SSRI/SNRIs I have tried over the years is sexual dysfunction.

I find it incredibly difficult (almost impossible) to ejaculate during sex.

My wife and I want a baby (you can see a slight issue here)

Tonight she told me that she is ovulating the week after next so I have to come off my meds before then.

Last week I went to the funeral of a guy I knew years ago who, a few months ago, came off his medication just before his girlfriend got pregnant.

My wife knows this, she drove me there, and she knows I have a history of suicidal thoughts, but she told me to come off my meds anyway. 

Of course I said ""OK I guess""",14Sep2019,9

Not sure if this is some self learner prophecy that enables me to act up, or what. Not sure what this is linked to, but I do have a history of sexual abuse and ptsd, with BPD symptoms at times.

He is gone. He no longer exists. My mind tries to figure out where he’s gone. I’m not religious in the slightest. Does he know he no longer exists? What’s it like to truly be nothing. Nothing but a lifeless body soon to be shoved in to the earth. I don’t know, I just don’t feel bad. People think I’m great. I’m often told I’m an angel or extremely nice and passive. But really it’s because I don’t care. I feel good when people smile at me. That’s why I compliment people. Today I complimented 134 people, yes I counted.

30,"Hi. So I’m on a lot of medication for bipolar disorder, ADHD, anxiety and depression, and I’m also on the autism spectrum. I’ve been home from college since last fall, and although things are getting a lot better, some things are getting much worse. I’ve cycled through a lot of medication this year, but I’ve seemed to settle on 3 that work for me so far. That being said, I work at a restaurant now, and I’ve noticed that simple math, such as adding up tips is getting extremely difficult—like “I have to look up 13x2 on a calculator” difficult. I’ve also been struggling to remember faces and names of people I’ve met before, to the point where I’ll have to ask the name of someone I’ve been working with for months. It’s really the math part that scares me, since I’ve never been good at algebra, but we’re talking me second-guessing the number of people in a party that I *know* is of 5. 

Anyway, I’m just wondering if this is normal for y’all with ADHD and/or that’re on the spectrum. I’m starting to get really embarrassed and insecure about my seeming inability to perform basic tasks in a workplace. I’m happy to talk about the meds I’m on/have been on, whatever.

I want to make the long story short everything happened about 2 years ago when my friends and I went to play basketball in the court, I used to practice basketball by myself in our Garden before, but never go for the basics so I didn't know how to defend in Basketball,30 minutes before we go to play, I was with my girlfriend and and we had great time together I was so happy and energetic at that time,so by the way we started to play game, we played about 10 minutes and we had some shots, my friend started to make fun of Me in front of other people,i don't know why but wanted to take revenge from him, that time was winter and i wore a tight coat and I couldn't even move my hands and arms correctly, so i wanted to takr it of but all of my friends were playing and no one were here to handle it and I didn't take the risk to leave it on the ground in front of other people,because it was expensive, so I wentl to defend my friend who was dribling but I didn't move down enough because of my coat and i go so close to him because i couldnt strech my hands too and as I mentioned before I didn't know the basics well so my nose came in collision with my friends head who was driblling and got broken in three places so that night passed and after that I went to fix it after I came out from the surgery and after 7 days when I remove the bandage i got shocked at that time because my face got totally different, immediately I started to compare my pictures from the past and from my post surgery and I knew something was changed so I went for that doctor again and started to fight with him because he didn't give my old face back and by the way I became depressed day by day first think happened my girlfriend break up with me second one was that I was a good student at college but I didnt finish my college at time that I wanted to,so day by day i became more and more depressed I even though about suicide, started taking psycho people medicines, even got a job at that time and was going to ruin it and fire from there, fight with family,leaving them and… i become totally different person,nothing make me happy in life again, every day the memory of that day haunts me and i cant take it anymore, i almost wasted two golden years of my life from 21 to 23, i dont how to forgive myself for that day, my mind is getting melted because i think every miliseconds about that accident , help me pleasee!",14Sep2019,2
33,"i know i’m not ok. i feel ‘crazy’, if i can say that. i’ve been told by the closest people to me that they believe i’m bipolar, have a mood disorder, or even a personality disorder. I have quite a good understanding on these things because my parents both work closely with mental health. my mother is basically a psychiatrist, she diagnoses people and prescribes medication. i grew up seeing tons of dsm books. i haven’t self diagnosed anything, and i don’t plan to. however, i will say that i know that i’m mentally ill and i know several things that it could be. but mainly, i just wanna focus on the symptoms i know that are wrong.

i’m 21. a lot of things have gotten worse within the past few years. when i was a teen i was ‘crazy’ at times. i believe i had body dysphoria and may still suffer from that a bit. I believe I had an eating disorder, I had very disordered eating. starved myself, lost a lot of weight quickly, over exercised beyond exhaustion. but i also got physically sick around 12 and i am disabled from that. i do have been diagnosed for the physical things. anyways, i never got diagnosed with much other than depression and anxiety because i didn’t want to. i knew what they were looking for i knew the answers i needed to give to hide what was wrong. i didn’t want anyone to know. i didn’t wanna be sent anywhere or forced to do anything i didn’t want to. i still don’t. i know that telling the wrong person what i feel can cause my life to change way too quick. and being physically sick i’m terrified of being sent somewhere they disregard my physical illnesses and i get punished even more for things. when i was younger i self harmed as well. manly cutting and hitting myself to make bruises. i still cut to this day, it’s mostly in binges. i don’t care to much these days because i rather just kill myself and i did that more to cope. i’ve always experienced dissociation, even since a very young kid. and now it’s gotten worse recently. 

idk i’m rambling. but let me get to the point right now i have been experiencing really bad dissociation. i often don’t feel i’m here, it’s like i’m just watching something. i question a lot of reality and some of my thoughts even disturb myself. i really feel like life isn’t even real at times. i believe i’m close to developing delusions and i’m really scared of that. i think i may experience symptoms of ocd. i have to check things a lot sometimes, i feel sometimes if i don’t do something that something bad will happen - this may must be an extreme form of anxiety idk. it’s not like i feel my whole family will die or the world will end or anything though. i’m tryna jot as much as i can down but my mind is so fogged right now due to physical fatigue i’m sorry this post is a total mess. i have been isolated a lot in my life sheltered by my parents + being sick i have been home bound for months and months at a time over like 9 years.  i will repetitively think about killing myself and it won’t leave my mind. it was to the point where i went out to do it but one thing was off and i ended up disoriented af instead of dying unfortunately. i know i am a danger to myself, i’m not sure about others.. i have done some crazy and dangerous things when my moods have been all over the place like even with my vehicle and being a little violent and i am ashamed and trying to keep that under control. i want help especially because it’s becoming harder and harder to seem normal in my head. i want help but i’m really afraid of being sent somewhere and not having any control. im also not really able to get it because i’ve asked my parents before but they don’t care ironically with their jobs. i did see ppl a few times and like i said i lied and they said i was ok. i know things are getting worse and idk what to do. i may just kill myself. i just don’t wanna start getting too lost from reality. i wonder how crazy i seem now lol.. but anyways like idk what to do cause i can’t work and afford my own insurance to go to someone myself due to being disabled. i have looked into support groups but can’t go physically to them and i don’t think they’d help anyway. i think i need actual medications. bc seems to help with my moods when i take it. i’m very sensitive to meds with effects on moods too like steroids and accutane. sometimes i think of hurting myself in really bad ways and i know id do it too. things are just getting outta control cause my physical health is getting worse as well as my mental health and i can’t handle this alone. guess i just wanna know thoughts",14Sep2019,1
34,I don’t know where else to put this and it’s been bothering me for a long time I’ve been diagnosed with adhd but the way people describe it doesn’t sound like what I feel. The way people describe it is not being able to focus but my problem is that I feel physical pain and stress in my chest when I have to do work that someone else tells me to do. I can do work fine if it’s something I decided to do like if I had homework and decided to do it just to get it over with but if someone were to come into my room and tell me to do my homework while I’m already doing it I feel that feeling you get when you do something tedious over and over again and it slowly grows to the point where I begin to cry but it’s only with work people tell me to do. The reason why I feel like this isn’t adhd is because of the fact that it’s only described as an inability to focus or something along those lines and I’ve found nothing about the severe pain I get in my chest or the fact that it only happens when I have to do work I don’t want to do and something else I’ve noticed about it is that it’s usually specially with school work. It doesn’t matter if the assignment is to play video games all class period if the teacher or anyone else tells me to do it then I can’t. I take adderal and that usually makes the feeling go away when I work but if I think about the fact that the pain is gone it will immediately come back. I just really want to know if this is adhd or if I’m just not looking hard enough for people with similar experiences.,14Sep2019,1

OK so when I got off the bus today I was really really tired and just wanted to sleep so i fell asleep on the couch for four hours, woke up and started flipping the frick out internally. Then when my parents got home a little later It got worse and I just wanted to scream like that stupid will.i.am song.  I  started to like hyperventilate  and laugh like what?! I started crying and I still am.  I’ve been tweaking out  for the past two hours and it’s hard to breathe.  What the frick is wrong with me?  Is this what it feels like to do drugs?  On Jah,  I’ve never touched drugs in my life,  but I’m tweaking out bro!  I took an Advil p.m. and I still can’t sleep!  Sorry this is so long but I don’t know what’s wrong and when I googled my symptoms it gave me some scary results that i’m pretty sure are inaccurate.  I think whatever is happening actually started in seventh period today because I just wanted to cry for no reason but I held it in Cuz mama didn’t raise no bitch. 

Note: After I wrote this in my notes, I started coming down from whatever the hell happened. It’s starting again now 20 minutes later as I’m posting this. I’m really tired and I feel numb now, but I just wanna cry not like a teary cry but like a whiny moan. Know that’s what I mean on here when I say cry.

for example instagram hides vent art, no matter the context or content. if you tag anything as vent art it automatically flags it and send you a message about self harm and suicide, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but the fact that it hides it from people is frustrating.

Although going to the store to maybe get something that I have run out of like razors, shampoo, ect. I will not do unless I already happen to be out and I'm able to stop at the store and get it OR if I go out with someone. 

I'm not comfortable just running out and going to get something at any time of the day or night. 

BUT the thing is, if I'm with someone like a friend or S.O I'm always the one saying we should go out and do something to the point where they get tired of it. I become annoying.

It’s like he’s crying out for help but he’s pushing me (and everyone else away) 

He bought a bus ticket and is going to visit friends 
Says he’s not coming back- highly unlikely.

51,"August 3, 2011 was the start. I will never forget the way the light came through my blinds that morning and the position my head laid on the pillow in when I opened my eyes. That was just the beginning of many years of feeling like I couldnt leave my bed. I wont get into details, but I was 14. Even when I was past what had happened, the depression didnt leave me and I was constantly confused and frustrated. Tried to commit suicide a few times that year and by 15 I was almost successful, but I was taken to the hospital and they plunged my stomach. Somehow in my fucked up delirious state was able to manage convincing the doctors I had just taken too many sleeping pills on accident so they wouldn't send me to the pavillion, but by 16 a doctor started basically shoving anti depressants, anxiety, bipolar, and ADD pills down my throat at the same time. If I wasnt fucked up enough, consistently taking all of these things and abusing vyvanse will throw off the person you thought you were and turn you into something you dont know, especially when you're a growing kid and dont know any better. I started drinking heavily on the weekends because It was literally the only thing that could make me feel. Everything was so numb. I quit all of the meds 6 months later and my brain was completely out of dopamine. I ended up at a party maybe a month later and tried cocaine for the first time. It was like an angel that came to me when I was desperate for something... anything. That sent me down 2 years of absolute fucking chaos. Dropped out of high school, was in plenty of life threatening situations, had men that I loved take advantage of me left and right and destroy me, etc. By 2016 [18] I made a choice of what path I would go down and that day I poured all of the alcohol in my apartment down the drain. I still drank, but not on the level and frequency as I did. I struggled and relapsed with cocaine a few times, but I'm free of its clutches now. Even those changes couldnt take the depression and anxiety away. I started turning more and more inward and clutched onto my very close friends like I needed them around 24/7 because i couldnt take being alone, i was extremely toxic to myself and the people around me. It wasnt their responsibility to carry my burdens. That went on for a couple of years. Things finally went HARD south when I was 20. Everyone was gone and I burned all of my bridges. I wanted to scream ""fuck everything and everyone I'm fucking done"" everyday. I isolated myself for a year [21-22]. I was taking xanax every day, reflecting on all of my flaws and trying to be a better person. Back in may, I got a job that I had been waiting for for 5 months, and everything started to change. I had the courage to quit smoking after 4 years, I had the courage to quit xanax, I had the courage to try to rebuild the bridges with the people I loved the most. I mean, these things weren't over night changes and they're still works in progress, but I'm a million miles from where I once was. So many years i accepted I was a broken beyond repair person, but I was so wrong. Not every day is easy, but I'm at peace now when just last February I was ready to leave this earth. This world works in amazing, mysterious ways but I'm glad I'm still on this earth. 

I wanted to tell my story for all of the pain, suffering, and torture I've been through and bring myself closure for the next many chapters of my life. I hope my story can help someone else find the strength to keep going. Theres always a way, but it's not and will never be easy. There will be trials and errors that you will need to learn from, but the end of the tunnel is more rewarding than anything else I've ever felt. Thank you for reading",14Sep2019,1

How long are you staying for? I would do this to anyone and everyone who came to visit I would aproach them during the visit and ask when are you going home? And I don't recall this but I would go get my mum's bras and underwear out of her closet bring them into the kitchen and chuck them all around the room to make the visitors uncomfotable and leave my mom thinks I did it because I didnt like not getting all my mom's attention I'm not sure thats the reasson because other occasions like Christmas day on only 2 years of my childhood when was around 6 and 7  we had family come for christmas  lunch or dinner and cousins my age and younger would come the rule was on those 2 ocassions us kids had to play outside I hated that I was stuck around all them other kids so I told them we will go play in the shed once they all walked in I quickly shut the door and locked them all in then went inside and left them locked in there it wasn't  long before I got in trouble my mom would hear me laughing then them screaming to be let out so I would regreatefully have to let them out I also locked other kids in the shed to on other ocassions. I went to 4 different schools as a kid because we kept moving houses each school I went to I never had more then 1 friend and they were all the loners and weird creepy kids that grew up to be predators. Now I'm 24 and am scared of absolutley everyone accept my wife I get anxiety when visitors come over I live in fear that people will just come over whithout any  notice I have a rule if anyone wants to visit they have to make a appointment I have huge trust issues whith everyone I don't really feel content or enjoy socializeing  i never understood why that is I'm terrified of confrontation I can't stand up for my self thought alone makes my legs shake and Im scared everybody and anybody I meet is likely to hurt me I say yes to absolutely eveything can never bring myself to dissagree or say no to people I almost brake down in tears if someone raises their voice at me or gets angry it really shakes me up I went thru a lot of emotional abuse as a child and was very shelterd from the world  my family use to have roaring loud arguements every day so I chose to separate myself from them from the ages 12 to 14 lived in my shed in the backyard and spent all night and day alone it was that bad the neighbours would hear my family argueing from inside their house and il catch them standing in their backyard listning all the neighbours seemed ok and they would tell me they felt bad for me having to go thru that everyday while I was staying in the shed I started smoking cigarettes weed and drinking just to cope I went down a destructive path making lots of mistakes snapped out of it when I met my wife now I don't do any one those things anymore I don't feel comfort in people in anyway I only feel myself happy and at peace whith my wife I am and have seen so many diffrent psychologists and psychiatrists and case works and consolours but not one of them have any clue what's going on whith me as in why I dislike all people so much and why I acted that way as a child.,14Sep2019,6

I've been having irregular mood swings where I will either cry one moment or feel a random surge of anger out of no where. I'll also feel like the world is out to get me and whenever something happens, be it super small or important I will freak out on the inside which seeps out onto the outside. My mind is constantly thinking too, and it's just becoming more of a headache for my fiancé and myself to deal with. I over analyze and over think everything and constantly remind myself and my fiancé meaningless things like cleaning the house, bills etc... Over and over again because if I don't I feel like something bad is going to happen, so I ritualistically do it. 

I've never been diagnosed with anything other than depression in my early teens but I may feel I am developing Bi-Polar or a form of OCD. The only way I can get these feelings away is if I self medicate with recreational marijuana from the local dispensary with my fiancé. However, I don't want marijuana being the only thing to help me as I don't always feel like getting baked, and it's a lot of money with dispensary taxes. Aside from that, I've been getting lots of lack of sleep from these issues and I would really appreciate someone helping figure out what the hell is wrong with me.",14Sep2019,1

-He goes out of his way to sit with me every day

- He’ll always go “you weren’t here x time/day!”
( I always notice people are are indifferent to your presence won’t point it out as much)

-He likes and wants to hang out outside of school with me

- he’s told me VERY personal things before, and when I’ve told him that he didn’t need to if he didn’t want, he said he wanted to.

- He’s said he finds me interesting 

- We laugh a lot together


The list that supported that idea that I was a bad friend read:

- I’ve hurt his feelings/insulted him by accident.


Everything else that I wanted to write were projections rather than tangible actions of mine (I don’t deserve him, I’m not a good enough friend..)

I just wanted to let anyone out there who feels like this that we often beat ourselves up over pretty insignificant things and believe we are wholly bad as a result. Just look at my list lol

Just remember that you all are worthy of good things, and every mistake you make or every person you may hurt doesn’t add any “points” to this “bad” meter. You don’t have to constantly criticize yourself to improve, and you can improve without self-criticism.

First i'm New to reddit and i'm not a native english speaker - so excuse me for mistakes in this Text.

So... In the last few years I dealt with my self. I Was thinking a lot about myself and what I really want in life. I found out some weird facts about myself and don't know if this is.. Normal? It don't feels normal compared to others people 'normal' I think...
I only feel myself complete when I'm sad or fucked up in other ways. When I'm sad, it feels.. Right. Same with lonliness. I hate to be lonely but when I'm with friends, I want to be alone again after short time to think about sense of life and such Things (yep, I'm intrested in spirituality and these things). I don't think of suicide or hurting my self. It's just... I love to be sad and lonely but hate it the same time. Also with relationships. I can't build up Feelings to women.. At least nö strong Feelings. This is the case since my ex GF left me 7 years ago and since then I was never able to create such deep feelings for any other women again - and there had been a few. I also have a GF now but the wish to be single again raises every day. The moment I got the relationship to a woman safe is the moment I don't want her anymore. Sounds hard and like an asshole, I know, but I can't hide myself from the truth. I also felt alone in every relationship the last years.
I have an active social life, friends and it's not hard for me to find new friends.. But I still feel Sad and lonely in the inside.

It's all very upsetting but I can't turn it off. My mind just keeps making these sorts bad day dreams, waking nightmares. Even if I stop myself it just resumes, and I can only distract myself for so long.

I have had these stints of ""delusions"" or whatever. I watch something on TV, then I absolutely believe that I am ""that"". Lately I was watching something about the Catholic church, and I went into a loop of extreme adherence to the Catholic doctrine, even though I am not religious and have never been. Then when I have ""doubts"" about belief, rightly so as I am not religious at all, I get extreme anxiety and get very depressed and I try to force myself to believe until I crash completely. On other occasions I was convinced that I was gay, even though I am as straight as I can possibly be, and I have nothing at all against gay people. This only happens when I watch movies or tv shows depicting gay couples or people. Spent alot of time trying to ""prove"" to myself that I as gay and I don't want to go into too much detail about that. When I can no longer convince myself that I was gay, again I became extremely depressed and very very anxious.

It's really exhausting when these fixations pop in my head, as they can continue for months or disappear in days. And no I am not trying to explore my sexuality, as I am not sexually active and haven't been for 10 years. I have no interest in dating. At all.

This story is relevant, but I’m more concerned about figuring out the difference between sadness and depression. So even if you don’t read the story, I’d still like your help.

About a few months ago in the summer, I (17f) was always working and never had time to do things. I went to work, then went home, and did everything over again. I was getting pretty sad, because I didn’t really have time to hang out with friends. Then I quit my job, but all my friends were busy, so I couldn’t do anything with them. So there I was, completely free, but nothing to do. I became very sad, I felt hopeless and everything I use to love doing, made me more sad. 

So I went to reddit just to rant and talk to people. I found a guy, and we completely hit it off. Stuff started progressing on a romantic level. I was so happy, and it was truly the happiest I’d ever been. But just a few days ago, he told me that we couldn’t do this anymore. I’ve been crying non stop for days. I’m uninterested in everything again, I feel like how I did a few months ago, but 10x worse. 

I don’t have anyone in my life to talk to about this. What do I do? Am I depressed? Or am I just sad about a break up?",14Sep2019,1

But every time I carefully touch the subject she starts screaming at me, telling me that I'm fat, ugly and crazy and that I should go back to therapy for my laziness. (I had therapy for 4 years for my depression.)

My mother has extreme outbursts of endless hate and aggression, but only towards me, my father and some other people in our family/in her life. She also has people who could never do anything wrong and no matter what, she will always be incredibly nice to them and spoil them. That niceness is very odd, it can feel creepy to other people because it is so over the top and fake. The more aggressive and hateful she gets towards one person the more ""loving"" and ""caring"" she will get to the other person at the same time. 

The outbursts are completely unprovoked and there is absolutley no indicator that an outburst is coming. The only sign of an aggressive episode is that she is stressed before, which is when the people she ""hates"" run away or hide.

92,"So, I am having a problem.  I am a disabled veteran of the US Army and have VA coverage(meaning I can go to VA for all my health issues at no charge).  I have attempted to seek therapy through the VA for mental health issues(ptsd/cptsd, anxiety, depression, and other issues) but they are not allowing me therapy saying that they cant give me individual till I go through group therapy.  My issue is I have tried group therapies before and they only make me worse not better cause I hear many peoples stories and what they have been through and it all seems so minor compared to my stuff.

Further i have when in those groups tried to share and been told it is too heavy or it will start triggering people so i stop sharing in groups.  It ends up as somewhere I go and disassociate.  I have explained this and it doesn't matter, they have their policies they need to follow and cant change it.

I have no other insurance and for a therapist with the credentials and experience I need to help me it costs about 200-400 a session.  I can not afford this.  That would come out to between 800-1600 a month.  Thanks to my VA disability income i am out of the low income area of income ans have no way to qualify for sliding scales.  

And let's not get me started on scripts and how much that would also cost me, cause between my scripts and the therapy i would be using 2/3 of my monthly income on my mental health.  

This is an issue as I had a meltdown(I have friends that are on the autistic spectrum that have told me after the way I describe my meltdowns, the way I am just day to day they believe that my adhd diagnosis when a teen was wrong and should have been aspergers.  It has also been hinted at by a friend who is in the last 6 hours of an abnormal psyche major.  Further when explained to me, I can see it and have worked in and around the disabled since ee's my younger brother with down syndrome was born when I was 6 so 29 years now). During the meltdowns I have, I beat my head with my hand.  During the last meltdown I was hitting my head so hard that I caused hematoma over 3/4 of my hand and going down my wrist.  I am going to ER at VA later for xrays as my hand is still numb.

I guess I just really need to vent, but if anyone has advice it would be really helpful (germany).

My sister moved away 3 years ago to study in the same (very competitive) field as me. She failed out of the university, and then started again the next year in a much less competitive university. She again failed her first year, and started going to a psychologist. My parents wanted her to stay at home and enroll in a local university, she wanted to go back to the university that's far away.

She wasn't going to classes, she spent basically all of her time on video games, she didn't eat properly she didn't sleep properly. We did everything that we could to support her, coming on weekends to clean for her, cook for her, be with her. In April she attempted to commit suicide, but didn't succeed. She went to the hospital when realizing what she had done. She didn't admit it to us, we were told by her friends. My mother went to get her and bring her home, she got a psychiatrist and still the psychologist, and got on antidepressants. The psychologist also wanted her to do a (voluntary) stay in a clinic, which she agreed to do. She was diagnosed with a range of mental health issues ranging from depression to borderline personality, and well as social anxiety.

She lasted about a week in the clinic. After the first day she wanted out, and because there was no obligation to be there and she is an adult, she came home to my parents. It started out okay. She ate well, she slept well but she spent her whole day playing video games. A few weeks ago after I left to go back to uni, she told me she was kind of dating a guy she met in het video game, but it just seemed like a little game crush. 2 weeks later my mom caught her just before she was going to fly to Norway without telling anyone to meet the guy for a whole week. With  no backup plan. With no hotel booked.

She didn't take it too kindly and my mom has been on the receiving end of what I can only describe as verbal abuse and manipulation from my sister. My younger sister gets constantly critiqued for her choice of clothes, of music, or whatever she dislikes that day. My only contact with her is when she calls me because she is walking out in public which stresses her out. This wouldn't bother me if she didn't criticise my lifestyle (my lack of boyfriend, my apparent lack of social life, my good grades in a program she failed) in my back. 

She has now decided that she is going to Norway for a week and staying with this guy we know nothing about. The name she gave us doesn't come up in google, she doesn't want us to get in contact with him. I guess if anyone has gotten to this part of my rant (thanks !) we are wondering what we should do. We can't stop her because she is over 18. My mom is probably going to end up in the hospital from overstressing because she probably is not going to answer her phone as often as we would like her to. She hasn't told the medical staff about her plans. My parents offered to fly the guy out and put them both up in a hotel but she refuses. What if she doesn't come back ?",14Sep2019,4
94,"\-I would like to note that this is not a call for attention, I am really sturggling and i feel truly alone, even surrounded by people i know and love.-

My mental health the past few years has been on a VERY slippery slope and recently things are just starting to get worse by the day.

Im finding it very overhwhelming and hard to wake up and feel like this every day, I want to function like a 'normal every day human' but these thoughts are starting to control my life. I always have this anxious doubt that something bad is going to happen, a prime example would be that I have met the love of my life and i feel like she is going to leave me. I dont want to drag anyone i know down with me so i feel like its best i keep these thoughts to myself. There is also deep feeling that my emotions will ruin things and she is at a really good point in her life and i dont want to scare her off. 

But when i do try and talk about things with people I have noticed that i become very obsessive and go on and on and on and it becomes kind of a headache whenever I explain it so someone.

I'm finding myself often thinking about ending my life even when im not having a meltdown inside my head, its become a common thought even when im riding the bus home. it creeps in to every day life, almost as if its normal? 

I dont know if would ever do it again, i have tried before and failed and i seen the pain it caused family. But the thoughts and feelings are becoming so hard to bare i find myself just wailing and crying when the house is empty, or when i was working i would have to go to the bathroom to cry. 

This is also feels really embaressing for me...",14Sep2019,1
95,"I have recently become aroused and frequently fornicate to rape porn. Its not that I need extreme stimulus because I do it so often: I hardly ever masturbate. However I got the idea quite randomly and now I keep coming back to it.

I keep coming back to a video where a man rapes a girl in the subway, then proceeds to bash her head into the concrete pavement. I normally find the 2nd part more arousing. What is wrong with me? I'm always filled with disgust after the fact, yet I keep coming back.

I'm not a psychopath and feel regular emotions in terms of sadness and pain. I come from a good family with a normal upbringing, yet somehow I now have a monster inside of me. 

I have abstained from all pornography for over 1 month now to try and fix myself, however I'm still shocked and a little scared at myself, as I know that given the chance, I would have no problem going back to the brutality.

I hope to god I never have the inclinations to do this in real life. What is wrong with me? How do I fix myself?",14Sep2019,1
96," I just want to preface this by saying that I'm a predominantly mobile Reddit user (easier on my vision), so apologies for any formatting blips or weird autocorrect mishaps. Also, I am using a throwaway for this, for the sake of my paranoia, if nothing else.

 So to set this rant up I'm just going to clarify some stuff quickly, rather than give out my whole entire boring life story. I've always had pretty bad social anxiety and it was absolutely crippling until about three years ago when I went to therapy and got my life together- but as a result of 13 years of agoraphobic isolation, I never really had friends. I'm not sure if my nomadic upbringing is to blame, or if it's my anxiety, or perhaps it's just my personality; but people have never been of much interest to me. Relationships of any kind were never my priority and still aren't, though I never hesitated to interact with others if they approached me first.

 So that's how all of my friendships came to be- someone greeted me (usually out of pity) while I sat alone and did my thing, then they'd do all of the talking and I'd offer a few short replies here and there. I'd listen and compile every piece of information they gave me, then I'd slowly start to engage conversations using it- this gave them the idea that I cared about their lives and wanted to know more, so they'd talk, I'd listen, and life would move on. I never considered any of them my ""friends"" because, I mean, they knew nothing about me, but I knew everything about them. My first ever best friend- Jake -was my sole companion for roughly five years (before he started dating a girl and moved on from me). I recently came to find out that he didn't even know my last name for those 1,874 days.

 That's also how I met my first girlfriend, Molly. She spoke to me and unloaded her thoughts while I listened and drew her pictures, wrote her short stories and played her music. She was my first kiss, and I'll admit that it was pretty good- exhilarating, even. But it's been two years since then (I'm now 16) and that ""rush"" I felt then has never occured since.

 I've since been broken up with and ""ghosted"", and due to my homeschooling, I haven't been put in a situation where people can approach me like they used to- though I imagine they wouldn't like to, anyway; puberty came, tourettes got worse, and now I'm mostly known as ""that girl"", ""the quiet chick"", and ""who?"".

 But this isn't really my main issue nowadays; no, my problem stems from a suffocating sense of loneliness that I have probably always felt, but haven't been aware of until recently. See, I came to this conclusion one night when I was sketching and talking to my ""friends"". These friends, however, don't talk back- because they don't exist. I don't know when it started exactly, but for the past few years (maybe even my whole life, I really can't recall) I have managed to unconsciously fabricate these people that live in my mind and that care for me deeply. They're all different in personality and they all interact in varying ways, both to myself and each other. They are so extensively fleshed out and ""real"" that it's as if they truly exist. I don't think they're hallucinations, though, because they only come when I ask them to, and I never actually physically see or hear them, but they communicate to me almost telapathically(?).

 But a while ago, I had this moment of realisation, a sort of clarity in which I paused and thought ""these people don't *exist*- they're not *real*, they never were"". I broke down crying and have spent the last few months grieving in a way I can only imagine is similar to the ways people do when someone they love has passed away. I never actually *knew* these people because *I* was the one to create them; to fill an empty space in my life, to have someone to love in my own strange way who would love me back just as much. Or maybe it was all just because I could? I really don't know.

 My worry is that I've developed some form of dissociative disorder- retreating into my own version of this world, filled with people that I have created to be just how I need them to be- or perhaps it's a mild sort of psychosis. I'm no doctor, so I really do not know. These figments of my imagination still talk to me, no matter how hard I try to make them leave. They seem sad, confused, hurt- just like *I* do. I can't tell if perhaps I'm the one that's imagining all of this, or if *I'm* the one who's been made up, and these people are the ones who are actually real. I don't know if any of you people are real either- is my family even real? My former best friend? My ex-girlfriend? Did I make them up too? Did they make *me* up?

 I'm strangely terrified and horribly isolated and I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm existing around all of these people who can interact with each other effortlessly, while it seems that I am always trapped behind a sheet of glass, with everything just out of reach.

 I'm sorry for how long this is, but I had to rant to someone- even if none of you truly exist. I just want these people to leave me alone, to stop invading my thoughts, to stop *loving* me so that I can, too. Not to be overdramatic and needlessly poetic, but it feels like all these ""other fish in the sea"" are swimming around happily together, while I can't even dip my toes into the water, let alone baptise myself in it and greet all of these other creatures that I know nothing about. I just want to be alright again.

TL;DR - My sense of reality has been destroyed and I don't know what to do about it.",14Sep2019,1

101,"Quick rundown of my life-

I was born into a family with enough money to live on Mars, should that ever becomes a reality. I've always been a solitary creature, preferring to be alone but still visit friends when I can. My mother died from cancer right before I started middle school, and it's been a slippery slope ever since. After that my father emotionally neglected me for some years afterwords and would throw money at me to fill the growing void. In high school I became heavily reliant on weed to replace my feelings of emptiness and to forget about whatever gloomy shit was bouncing in my head at the time. 

I am 23 now, and I have put down weed completely. I go to the gym 5 times a week, and work a steady job with good pay.  My father and I have a very good relationship now, and I have resorted to living a very minimalist lifestyle, relinquishing my days of materialism and greed. I've been receiving ketamine treatment for my depression and anxiety, having a tremendous effect on my mood and self image. Sure, it might like I've come a long way, but I've begun to feel like something huge is missing.

My drive to meet people is nowhere near as strong as it used to be. I'm becoming increasingly selfish and cynical. I spend my off days with nobody but myself 100% of the time. The apathy I've had throughout my life is forming something entirely new to me, and it's scary. I want to care about people, but I feel like I can't. I've been hurt so many times I feel like  my brain is just done playing this game. To give more context, I moved to another state for work and nothing else, I have 1 friend that I occasionally hang out with but all of my close friends and family live in another state. The dog I grew up with for most of highschool recently died while I was out of state; I didn't shed a tear, but I wanted to. My emotions have been reduced to their lowest frequency  due to the events in my life. y question now is, HOW THE FUCK DO I STOP THIS BEFORE I LOSE MYSELF ENTIRELY? Therapy has never worked for me, and I'd rather be alone than meet people. What am I? Am I fucked?",14Sep2019,2
102,"There's various hobbies, adventures, activities or even sports I've always wanted to try, maybe even pursue throughout my life. Some have lingered like a friend I'll go see one day, but not today.

I imagine how much I might enjoy them, or how I could become proficient, even good at them. It can be the smallest thing from reading a new book, to wanting to try archery or play basketball again, do metalworking or go on a solo holiday. But I always feel ashamed, I feel guilty or anxious. I can't seem to make it happen, I imagine how ill be judged, or that it's frivolous or pathetic that I want to do it. I'm introverted, socially I'm fine and surround myself with kind people who don't judge my shy nature, or that I'm soft spoken. 

But i can't seem to get past it; it being that I need to tailor myself to not be vulnerable with what I truly enjoy. To try and conform and latch onto others joys so that I'm not alone, so that I can he accepted. I spent a lot of my life quite outcast, and it was for my interests. Once upon a time just playing video games was enough reason to be belittled and relentlessly bullied. Till I learned to hide it all, to suppress my joys in life. To go towards that goal, the acceptable standards I feel I have to meet.

I hate that the parts of me I most love, are the hardest to share. I can talk about my depression, my anxiety or that I have ptsd from childhood abuse. I can be vulnerable here, I can defend my values and ethics even if people disagree and stand by what I believe. But not what I enjoy, I don't seem to have the strength.

However I have consistently over these 6years lost basically everything in my life which made me happy.  
I tried to channel my focus into launching a small side business as a hobby, and that did give me a daily purpose for the past year (alongside my main job), however I am now losing that business in an instant due to people blackmailing me/targeting me maliciously.

I don't know how many more days I can keep fighting for though, as the 1 and only thing keeping me from dying currently is that my parents wouldn't understand and would blame themself, however part of my mind thinks that if I wrote a letter long and detailed enough explaining how I would now finally be able to escape the misery they may understand and not blame themself.

112,"TLDR: A friend keeps telling me she's busy when i ask if she wants to hang and she's even assured me that she genuinely does want to hang, and that I'm not pestering her, but just doesn't know when she's free. She's literally told me that she would like to hang but there's still a voice telling me not to trust her and that she's lying. How do I get over this? She's a lovely girl and I feel bad that i'm still so unable to trust her even though I KNOW she means me no harm. More details below.

Lately I've (M 21) been trying to set up a time where I can meet up with a friend (F 19). We're on good terms and have hung out once before and have a good time together but all in all we're not super close yet. Either way, we're at uni together (lived in the same hall last year) and we hung out at the end of last year and it was real nice. We both agreed we had a great time and that we should do it again either over the summer or the beginning of this year. 

Well, we both moved back into the city (strangely on the same day lol) and i've asked her to hang once or twice in the week we've been here, but she's always said she's busy. At first I was doubting how busy she really was, and thought that maybe she was just trying to politely turn me down, but when I asked her yesterday, just as a follow up from a previous message because she said she'd let me know if she was free, she told me she genuinely does want to meet up and that it would be nice to see me again soon, she really just doesn't know when she's free. When I said I felt a little bad because I felt that I might have been turning into ""one of those guys"" that doesn't know how to take a hint, she assured me I wasn't. I basically said I didn't want to pester her, but I really did have a lovely time the first time we hung out together, and that I would leave it up to her to let me know when she was free. She agreed to this and said she'd definitely let me know as soon as she had time to hang.

So there it is, ***written confirmation*** that this girl ***does*** like me and want to see me and spend time with me.. but I still have that awful voice at the back of my voice telling me she's lying and that she won't ever actually message me to organize something. It keeps telling me I'll be forgotten and that I'm not really that important to her at all, and that there's no point in getting my hopes up because it's not worth it. Which I know is bullshit.

How exactly does one learn to ignore this voice? It's irrational and unnecessarily pessimistic and I hate it but it's a constant battle to keep my actual own mental voice on top. I have to go back and check those messages every now and again to remind myself she does actually like me and want to spend time together. How do you learn to let go and just trust what someone says?

Something you have to know about me is that I am a positive person. Most of the time cheerful and happy. Always looking at the bright side of life. Hoping everything is going to be fine, refusing to believe that the world is bad and corrupt. I know some people who think it is, and it breaks my heart. To see our loved ones struggling like that in life, without happiness and hope it’s heart-crushing.

**Everyone deserves happiness, but sadly not everyone sees it that way. I think we have to be there for them and bring even a little laugh and joy in their life. To show them not everything is black, and they deserve happiness.**

My life was and it’s complicated with smaller and bigger problems, like most of us. Always trying to see, remember and appreciate the good thing and forget/solve the bad.

I know this is personal and many people don’t see it or acknowledge it or they afraid to say this is a problem, but it’s real, trust me. I didn’t believe it myself until one day it surprised me.

#### How did it happen my first panic attack?

About a year ago my very close loved one got sick with an unknown medical problem. The doctors didn’t know what’s causing the pain and the problem. Every day was mixed with hope, fear, and tears. It was a very hard month. I was home alone, waking up every morning hoping that that day we will know what’s the problem and that it’s not fatal, how they told us in the beginning when they just guessing the disease.

After countless tests, guessings, sleepless nights and promises one day my brain decided it’s enough, obviously, and can’t handle every day twenty-four-hour stress. So that day I was in the living room, watching the television without knowing what’s on the program because it didn’t matter at all. I just needed background noise. All I can think about is when will this torture end, and all of sudden my heart started to pound like crazy.

Well, I’m in my 30s, healthy and I don’t take any medicine except sometimes an over the counter pain killer. My first thought was, maybe my blood pressure went up. But soon my hands started to tingle and felt dizzy, and then I got really scared and panicked.

I was like, ok I’m having a heart attack. I’m home alone if I faint no one will know, and I will die alone. Maybe someone will find me, but it will be too late. It sounds horrible but that’s what’s got across my mind in that second, probably everyone would think something like that. And it’s not getting better, the tingle and the heart-pounding was still going. I sent a text message to my family member that maybe I am having a heart attack. I will unlock the door if I faint, that they can come and help me.

Got up, walked up to the door to unlock it. Got back, laid down and hoped for the best. After a few minutes, I noticed that the tingle was less bad and the heart-pounding slowed down. Maybe I’m not having a stroke? Or maybe now I will end up fainting and lose my consciousness?

Until my family member got there all the symptoms were gone and I was feeling ok, as much as I could in that mess.

At the time I didn’t know what was that still thought my blood pressure caused it. After a few days, nothing bad happened to me, and I was thinking that I’m alright. I didn’t go tho the doctor, maybe it’s irresponsible from my side, but I’m trying to avoid doctors and medicine best as I can.

Fortunately, our agony ended after a month when the doctor’s found out what was the problem with my close loved one, and we where happy that in the end, everything is going to be fine.

I never looked back and didn’t even think that’s something wrong with me. Until one day when we were having a family lunch. Some kind of pressure, uncomfortable and indescribable feeling I never felt before, started to grow in me. I couldn’t sit one minute longer beside the table and I rushed out to the back yard.

Wasn’t feeling any pain or that I was scared of dying, just that uncomfortable pressure that if I don’t walk on fresh air I’m going to go mad. It’s a very uncomfortable feeling, and you don’t know why are you feeling it, just that can’t stay in current place anymore or you going to go crazy. It’s so strange, and I can’t explain better, if you didn’t feel it you will probably have no clue what I’m talking about.

So this happened a few times more, and I was starting to understand that I will not die from it, and probably having panic attacks.

### How I cope with panic attacks?

After I knew for sure, that my life is not in danger somehow I started looking it in a different way on these panic attack. Every time I felt that it’s coming, I said to my family that I think this is it, got up and started walking on fresh air, playing with my dog, or someone in my family started to tell a joke or funny story. Anything to stop my brain in this panicking loop. And it worked! After a few minutes, it was always gone.

For me, at first, this was horrible to understand that I’m having a panic attack out of the blue. Even when everything is ok. It can happen at any time. I’m sitting in the kitchen, thinking about what I’m going to make for lunch, and bum, starting to shake, feel uncomfortable and dizzy, and have a strong urge just to go out, leave the current place immediately and feel the fresh air.

**It’s very important if you feel these symptoms, and think you are having a heart attack to visit the doctor immediately and be sure it’s not.**

I know I said I didn’t go tho doctor myself, but I find myself lucky to not have some major medical condition or a heart attack, just a panic attack. I’m saying just a panic attack because if you know that you are healthy and it’s just a panic attack, you can somehow tell yourself and your brain that it’s a panic attack and you are not dying. Every time it happens to me I say everything is ok, it will end soon.

I’m not speaking for the people who have some of the heavier symptoms. Because I think my panic attacks are not so severe, it’s pain in the ass, yes, but I think I can handle it. So I can’t say that for everyone who is having a panic attack, is the same, and you will make it go away with these tricks. I just can give you advice on how I do it, and how you can try and win the battle.

Still today I have a panic attack here and there. Some uneasy feelings from time to time, but not so frequently like before.

### Support from friends and family

In my theory, the most important thing is that you can talk to someone who you trust, and tell them what are you going through. Talk, talk, talk. Support of people you trust is the key. Don’t be afraid to tell them how are you feeling, and get support.

* **Write a diary** if you feel that you can’t talk to anybody.
* **Get yourself a pet**, they are our four-legged best friends, and they know how to listen.
* **Start doing yoga or working out.**
* **Find a hobby** that you like or wanted always to try.
* **Learn** new things which interest you.
* **Stay positive** and surround yourself with positive people.
* Read, paint (even if you are not Picasso), sing, craft.

I was fortunate to get through without medications and complications. But if you feel that you need professional help, don’t be afraid to reach out.

So this is my story about how I started to have panic attacks. Are you or someone in your surrounding have similar symptoms? How do you coping with it?",14Sep2019,3

About 3 months after that, we got a new property manager and were told that the company no longer does lease riders (corporate decision, management had nothing to do w that) so if we had them they were not valid anymore &amp; the old manager pretty much told us that so all the employees would sign renewal leases. the only way to get out of these leases is to find someone to take it over which is extremely hard and rarely happens in my area. it’s gotten so bad lately that i cry everyday before and after bc i hate it so much. today i was unexpectedly called in to work (happens to everyone that works there a lot) and i just lost it. i had my first panic attack ever and i really felt like i was dying. i know i need to get out of this job but i feel so trapped due to the lease and i just don’t know how much longer i can make it. any suggestions on what to do?",14Sep2019,1

My dads brother died 2 days after the divorce that caused him to spiral into a bad depression he started cutting him self and eventually he hanged himself. I was the one to find him I went into his bedroom to find him hanging there I was traumatized.

J was new and very friendly we started talking and he became my best friend .

He saw my cuts during pe he started helping me when I was depressed I nearly killed my self I got therapy it didn't work eventually his family member died he was distraught I stuck by him luckily he didn't get as depressed as I did

126,"I don’t have many friends or family that care about me enough for me to tell so I’m probably just gunna make this and explain / say some shit. I was born in Abakan Russia (doubt you care lol) too a mother who was in prison for drug and alcohol abuse. My biological dad doesn’t know i exist because i was a cause of a one night stand with no protection (obviously look at me pointing the easiest shit out that anyone with half a brain cell would already figure out). I was then adopted and moved to the United States. Everything was pretty okay until some neighbors would pick on me and attempt to beat me up / fight me every day after i got dropped off by the school bus from 1st to 3rd grade (when i moved to a different neighborhood and changed schools). I remember vividly one incident that happened in 2nd or 3rd grade, i got off the school bus then when i was 1/4 of the way from the start of the street to my house (it was a bit of a long street) one of the kids older brother goes to my side of the street and starting running at me with big backpack in hand. I of course start running. I was almost at my house when that cunt knocked the ever living fuck out of me with his bag. Moving on. I had a bit of a difficult adjustment to the new school everything was okay i guess. Come 6th grade. This is when shit started to hit the fan. One of my friends hung herself in her closet sometime in November of that year and it was an utter shock for everyone when we were tolld. That was when my mental health started to take a stroll down the avenue of “fuck you im going to make you feel like shit all the time” i experimented with some ways i could hurt myself (because i was EdGy) and was diagnosed with depression near the end of that year. I’ve been diagnosed with depression for almost 3-4 years now and of those 3-4 years 2 of them I’ve felt suicidal. This pastmonth I’ve felt extremely suicidal and have thought about ending my life almost every day. I just sit in front of my PC playing games because I have nothing else to do. I’m not good at anything, I have no talents or outstanding characteristics. I have a shitty work ethic and probably won’t ever be hired and even if I do I probably would get fired pretty quickly. These past few months I’ve started to turn to pills and smoking (cigs, e cigs, Mary Jane)to try to keep myself somewhat “happy” but that isn’t really working anymore. I don’t see the need to live anymore. I’m debating on getting high, taking a fuck ton of pills, then probably slitting my wrists of I feel spicy (look at me slitting my wrists super EdGy and EmO).  I’m just so done with this shit I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve felt so numb since my ex broke up with me a 1 1/2 years ago. I don’t think I’ve ever really gotten over her. Even when she said she’d rather me / her die that get back together with me. I’ve shut my cousin who I used to be super close too but have shut out due to obvious reasons. When I do go to school I’m either ignored or judged harshly. I feel so fucking insecure when I go to school I’ve just decided to not go to school and stay at home not doing anything. I’ve tried quitting the pills I’m taking (not prescribed pills) but I’m a weak and needy cunt so I always go back to it and rely on it so much. I barely talk to many people , I’ve muted many chats i am / was in, havent really responded to my old friends, who i was close with a year ago, anymore, when i do the text i send back is super dry and mainly consists of one or two words.

129,"Hi,

I'm a sophomore in college. Last year, I was in an apartment style dorm and as such, was able to bring my cat, Bella, with me. I have severe anxiety and having her around helps me with it. A reminder of home is nice when I'm 1000 miles away from it.

This year, I'm in a one room dorm that opens directly outside. She likes to sit by doors, and it was too risky to bring her. There was a very real chance that she could have gotten out and run into the street. I tried to have the school place me in a dorm that could better accommodate this, but they refused, so I had to leave her at home.

Right now, I'm really not doing to hot. My two best friends are in a dorm together without me, and I'm with a total stranger who barely even speaks to me. Even though I spend time with my friends almost every day, I can't help but feel left out and lonely, and entirely overwhelmed. And I don't even have Bella with me to help calm me down. Even when I'm with my friends, I'm on my own.

I've only been here for four days and I've already cried four times. Five, if you count right this second. I don't know what to do or how to get through this. I'm already counting the days until I can go home (65).

133,"Hey Gang - I've been thinking about writing this post for a while, and am finally taking the time to do it. 

First off, it's tough for me to post this, because I really don't feel like I have much to complain about. I know from an outside perspective, most people see me as a very successful and good person, but I feel like a lot of that is just how good I am at putting up a front. 

I'm in my mid-30s, have a wonderful marriage to the love of my life (we've been together more than half our lives, and I love her now more than ever) and we have 4 children with special needs ranging from 7 to 16, all with significant needs, all adopted in the last 6 years. (All international adoptions, completely out of birth order. I love my kids, but often feel like I'm failing as a father for not doing a better job of meeting their needs, or for sometimes just being too shot at the end of the day to do the things I know I should be (reading books before bed, etc.) 

I have a good paying job as a professional, and have been in my field for over 10 years. I believe I'm good at what I do, and take a lot of pride in it, and really enjoy my work. My wife works full-time (nights) as a medical professional, and she is excellent at her job.

My wife and I also invest in real estate and have a couple of other small businesses that do OK, but that I don't spend nearly as much time on as I should. This is a big stress and embarrassment for me. 

And that's all the stuff I'm proud of - this is where it gets ugly. I'm a recovering alcoholic, and have been having relapses. I was sober for years, had a relapse, was sober for years, etc. Lately, I buy a 375ml bottle of liquor every couple of weeks, because I know I'll drink the whole thing of pretty much whatever I buy, and this keeps me from giving myself alcohol poisoning. I hide this from my wife by drinking while she is at work, and I am very ashamed of it. I've stopped for long periods before, and relapsed, then stopped for long periods, etc. It's never more common than every couple of weeks, at most, and is usually more like every couple of months I do every other weekend type of thing. And I make sure to drink quickly, to maximize the effects of the alcohol. It is not healthy behavior in the slightest. 

If/when I get away from alcohol again, I'll fill that gap with junk food, or video games, or work, or TV binges, or porn, or reading fantasy novels, breaking rules/laws just to get away with it, or pretty much any of the other socially acceptable things we all know are bad for us when done to excess - which is exactly what I do with them. They'll consume every free second of my time, to the detriment of my family and the things I'm supposed to be working on. 

In my own terminology, I feel like I am just completely susceptible to anything that can be addictive, and am obsessed with 'escape' from the stress of my life. One reason that I'm very glad I've always been way too scared to try any 'hard' drugs - I'd probably have OD'ed years and years ago. The only reason I'm probably not dying from liver failure is because my wife really stomped on my drinking quite a few years ago, which was extremely excessive and dangerous. And I'm very ashamed of my relapses. I convince myself that because I'm not drinking nearly as much as I used to, and because no one knows about it, it's OK for me to blow off steam now and again. But that's my justifying and lying to myself, and hiding something that would hurt my wife and my family, and I'm not Ok with that. 

And the stress in my life, of having so many (mostly positive) things going on, seems to eat me alive. I feel like that's one of the big drivers behind my escapism - I don't handle the stress of the decisions I've made in a healthy way, at all. 

I tend to exaggerate to make myself seem more important or better at things than I am as well. And it's embarrassing because I think I'm just desperate for approval from society and other people - something I actively try to resist and make decisions counter to. 

Really, I feel like a complete wreck who manages to hold it together most of the time, and who does OK with some things. And I get a lot of people feel like that, and there's probably nothing particularly special about my struggles - I'm just trying to present an honest picture of myself, and try to improve. 

So, my question: what is a good way to actually make healthy changes in my life, and get them to stick? I've read a ton of books over the years trying to develop myself as a person, as a leader, in business, etc. But I struggle to make changes that last, or to even make them at all these days. How can I learn strategies and/or techniques to correct my unacceptable and unhealthy behavior? It's really frustrating that I feel like I've been 'better' for years, and am now really struggling again, but don't understand the reasons for it. I try to have a realistic self-image and acknowledge what I am good at, and where I am failing, but I don't seem to be able to make any improvements that last anymore, and I feel like I'm continuing to slide, and missing out on what I'm really supposed to be doing with my life. 

I've oscillated hugely in this post between trying to make everything sound great, and terrible, and the truth is probably somewhere in the middle - but a lot of my behavior is unacceptable and embarrassing to me, and I think a lot of my escapism is from my shame of that. I feel like this is an area I need to improve, and would love some help in figuring out how.

134,"I know I’m going to sound whiny and dumb, but lately I’ve been having very vivid flashbacks to when I was younger and my stepdad would get drunk and scream at me. 

While I’m having the flashbacks I keep glitching between them and the real world.

I’m bipolar, with borderline traits, and a sensory processing disorder that makes loud noises sometimes seem so overwhelming that I can’t function. So when he would scream at me, it would trigger panic attacks, but panicking made him even more mad. So I would tough them out while trying really hard not to cry, and then eventually calm myself down using cutting and other self harm.

And I keep flashing back to these intense screaming sessions. When it happens I cry and isolate, and feel suicidal. I can’t tell people that though, because I’ll end up in a psych ward. So no one knows.

136,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I am a mid-20's woman, seeing a therapist for C-PTSD. My therapist is a middle aged lesbian who I quickly developed a good rapport with. For the first couple of months everything was fine. Then she started to make some off-color jokes. I told her to stop and she apologized, but made the same joke again a few sessions later. There were several times when she sat next to me on the couch and would do stuff like put her hand on my thigh while she was talking to me. She would also give me compliments like telling me I smelled good and she liked my cologne. (I like wearing men's cologne, I tend to present a bit masc.) It made me really uncomfortable but given my history of abuse I found myself just putting up with it to avoid conflict.

Then finally she crossed a line I couldn't just ignore. She hugged me at the end of our session (which we usually did) and she lightly grabbed and then smacked my butt. I was so stunned I just left without saying a word. I know I can't go back to her, but what should I do to make sure she can't do this to someone else? She's in a very small private practice, and she's in charge of most of the administrative stuff. Is there a procedure for when something like this happens? Who do I talk to?
