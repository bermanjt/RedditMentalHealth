For the past 4 years, ive been battling a combination of depression, severe adhd, and anxiety but i havent told anyone. Recently, my anxiety has been getting a lot worse, where combined with my adhd, i can barely get any work done unless i am either forced to or have a rapidly increasing deadline. I dont trust my parents enough to tell them, but at this point my mental state is really hindering my abilities to do anything. My anxiety/depression has kept me up all throughout the night, and i just dont know what i should do. I dont love my parents, and i highly suspect they dont love me as a person either. I just dont want to come out with my mental disorders to a family that doesnt love, nor will understand me, but i cant live like this forever",22Feb2019,1

2,"Before 2019, I was pretty happy( I can’t really sum it up but I was in a good place) 

Then New Years came, a friend invited me over and I stayed the night. My friends smoke weed and all that, it’s unavoidable, but I never smoked as much as they did, any-who, I decided I would try and actually get high (since I’ve been faking being high, I have adhd the silliness is already there)  and I did way too much, as a result, I had my first panic attack, in my life and I got to say the panic attack was obviously mortifying, but what was worse was what cane after it, I felt like I wasn’t the same anymore, like I was looking through a camera lens, this started effecting my relatively good grades, I made a promise last year I would try and I did, only for this feeling to ruin it, it had obviously worn down since then but I feel like a part of me is lost, 

I’m not any less social, in fact I’ve been more social since then so I could keep my mind off of it, but whenever I’m alone I overthink stuff and scare myself over stupid things, I am doing very well currently, this week has been a good week, but I feel like I need to understand what’s going on with me, because I felt like I was going insane during that time.

3,"Hello 

I am a male between 18-20 years old, and I have some problems with my mental health I think. I worry alot and too much about things. It’s very easy for me to get anxiety over things which I shouldnt get so much anxiety for (IMO). For example: i was sitting in my room eating pringles and my dad enters and makes it look like hes sneaking and starts asking questions (trying to be funny) and for some reason i snap at him and say: dont fool around and just take some. In an angry/annoyed tone, and he answers: sorry i was trying to be funny. After he went out of my room i get the big anxiety and overthinks it and i become really sad. The thoughts goes from that i was mean to that some day he might die and the thoughts just explodes. I got so much anxiety that I went to him and offered him the rest but he Said no its fine.

I saw a picture of a doc at a shelter getting excited over seeing his old owners who was there and were gonna adopt another dog. Couldnt stop thinking about that for some time. Whenever I say something to someone thats not my friends or family I always analyze it afterwards and get anxiety over saying things and what the thought about me and stuff. I got a call from my work (i work there now once a week so I could keep in touch with them because they wanted me more in the future). They called me and asked if I wanted to start working in the one month or 2 on halftime. I have sometimes hard to make decisions myself over anything so I asked them if I could think about it. Because i was gonna ask my parents. Instantly when I hang up i get anxiety over what I Said and thoughts like: maybe they think like: who does he think he are? And thoughts in that line. 

Whenever I buy a new clothing and wear it I become self concious and think like: people are looking at me, they think i dont fit in it. Whenever i am out in the city center I always think people look at me in a bad way. When someone laughs or grins I always think its about me. Those kind of thoughts.

I Also get alot of thoughts that I am being watched on a camera, but almost only in places like my home or work. I think people watch me through them to see what I am doing. I’ve never started to look for the cameras as I dont velieve myself that much, or that i shrug it of.

I overthink alot, about different things. Today was my teeth, that they Will fall out so i went to the bathroom probably 3 times per hour for 2 hours and overlooked them. Got bad anxiety and wanted to hurt myself in frustration, i gave myself a punch but not too hard (midswing i got afraid my parents would hear). I have selfharmed when younger, 15/16, only 2-3 marks with a knife which doesnt look like a typical selfharm cut. Mostly i punched myself with objects or banged my head in a Wall.

I always think i have random diseases or disorders (adhd, bipolar, borderline, diabetus, cancer, etc) 

I have hard time trusting people and think people plot against me in some way. The one i trust most is my girlfriend but i get these thoughts about her too sometimes, but not the same as friends but cheating, lying and stuff. Even though she loves me very much which she shows me alot. 

I dont know what I wanted with this. I had anxiety and my girlfriend is asleep ( we dont live together) and now I forgot what the purpose was. Oh and my hangover anxietys are so hard I can feel them for a whole day afterwards in whole of my body. I drink 1-3 Times a month.",22Feb2019,1
4,"My answer is: yes. 

Once, I would have said, ""No; it's just that more people feel comfortable coming forward because in general, there is more awareness. It's just being talked about more.""

But now, I see people say ""I'm so depressed I want to kill myself. My mom didn't buy me the new IPhone for Christmas!"", or ""I can't do the presentation in class, I have anxiety"". 

For the latter, I'm not saying that's not a real serious reason for some people (like me), but some people just use it as an excuse because they know it will work. There's a difference between nervous and anxious, and having an anxiety disorder.

What impact does this have on society?

It means that people who really struggle with mental illness such as anxiety and depression, or even bipolar and schizophrenia and anything else you can think of, have to live with the stigma.

Let me explain that: if so many people fake depression and anxiety or use the words wrong, people can see that they're lying. That means, the next time they come across someone who says they have anxiety or depression, they don't take it so seriously! 

The amount of times people have said to me ""[name] has anxiety and they can still go out with their friends and be normal, why can't you?"" And other stuff like this is bad and it's because people have a warped idea of what it's really like.

I just wish people would realise their actions contribute to society, something that starts small gets bigger and bigger and it can have bad ramifications for everyone else.

6,"Hi everyone, this is a question I asked myself which ended up making me realize the thought patterns that were holding me back. Our experience of life, our decisions and the way we perceive life is driven by the beliefs that adopt and hold throughout our lives based on our life experiences and how we let them shape our beliefs. Negative self-beliefs can originate from many different sources but the commonality is that the beliefs you have which hold you back are usually illogical and driven by fear.

My question to you all who are viewing this is what are some of the beliefs you hold that are holding you back in life? If you can name more then one, go for it. Really step back and observe your life from a third party perspective. What are the limiting beliefs that have been producing unwanted or negative consequences? You can then ask yourself what negative consequences have you already experienced as a result of this belief?

Identifying these beliefs is the first step in the process of changing those beliefs into empowering beliefs that will ultimate lead you to have a happy life, fulfillment and a healthy mind state.",22Feb2019,1

8,"Okay so I have no idea if this is a problem but I thought I might as well share. 

Do you ever have times where you kinda just space out? Like you either get lost in thought or just feel like you disappeared for a moment. It happens to me all the time. When it does happen I have no concept of time, anywhere from five minutes to and hour could pass and I just sorta “wake up” and don’t really know how long I’ve been gone or what’s going on.

This is really annoying when I’m trying to sit through classes at school. It ends in me not learning the lesson and having to figure it out on my own at home. It’s also a huge waste of time. I’ll have something to do one the weekend of after school and I’ll just space out and when I wake up I feel off and don’t want to work anymore.

I also get these super weird daydreams. For example the other day I was laying in bed not wanting to get up. I rolled over and grabbed my phone and started scrolling through a group chat I’m in a reading the messages. I suddenly looked over at the clock and realized that I. Was super late and started freaking out. Then I woke up. None of it happened. All the texts I read weren’t real and it was really two hours before I had to leave.

I don’t really know what’s going on or if it’s a problem but I thought I’d share just Incase anyone knows if its weird of if it happens to anyone else.",22Feb2019,1
9,Ever since I can rember I've had this condition called visual snow its a static overlay over my vision but doesn't appear much during the day but is really bad at night making it hard to read and just see in general. I made a post before saying how vaping cbd had really helped my depression and anxiety and I decided to up my dose as I knew I could help my other things like hallucinations and seizures. And I've only just noticed that the visual snow pretty much disappeared its still there slightly but its pretty much gone and I'm just amazed I got told there was no treatment for it and that doctors don't even believe you half the time but it's gone it will come back in a short while I know that but I'm just so happy to be able to see like everyone else can at night. With the seizures I've only had one before but I remember how I felt right before it and I've been feeling it alot lately and I'm so scared it's gonna happen again so I'm so thankful for cbd oil helping the anxiety and stopping it from happening as much as I know it's bad but I have to break the rules at work to vape there I do it outside as the walk to the smoking area is too far and if I do have a seizure on the way there it could be extremely dangerous for me as I work at a depo where lorries are constantly driving around and they're very bad drivers so I have to. I know my boss wouldn't mind especially if 8 told him my reason but I don't want to turn it into a big deal he knows I've had a seizure before but i don't want everyone treating me differently so I stay quiet. Sorry for making this long I'm just so happy that cbd is legal and it works and it's just made my life so much easier. I don't care if people judge me for using cbd it's legal and it helps me in so many ways which prescription drugs don't. I have never had a good experience with prescription drugs they all make me throw up and make me feel horrible I can't take most antidepressants as my body overreacts tothem and I end up extremely sick and high which is very dangerous for me as it can send me down a spiral of not caring if I die and I could end up ending my life because I was too drugged up to know that it's not a good idea. I love all you guys and I'm just so happy to be alive right now as much as my life sucks I'm just so happy and I want to thank my ex for saving me from. Ending my life even though she made me worse after things ended I wouldn't be here today stronger than ever. I want to thank you guys for being here even though sometimes nobody even reads my posts its at least somewhere I can vent and talk to somebody as I don't really have that close friendship where I tell them my feelings. I love all of you thank you 😊 ,22Feb2019,2

11," 

I'll try to keep this as brief as I can, and I'm not even sure this is the right place for this. 

One of my best friends of 15+ years kinda fell off the map the last few years. Longer really. Our friend group was close knit all through high school and years after, but he kind of broke off and kept to himself.

Recently he contacted me and explained his situation and asked for help. I went over to his apartment and found out a lot. He has basically been a recluse for the last three years and is almost immobile now. Drinking played a large part in this. He is out of money and doesn't have much family support. He reached out and asked me to help him, so of course I will.

Before I explain more, I will say that I'm deleting this in a few hours, because I know he uses reddit and I truly don't want him to see this. Moving on:

His apartment had years worth of trash in it. Every space available was packed full of trash and empty bottles. He can't cook for himself or shop, so he's relied on canned tuna or random things his mother drops off at his door (she's never been inside). Today I cleared 15 bags of trash out of his 1 bed apt, and that included probably 50 empty half gallon alcohol bottles. The bathroom has fecal matter all over the bowl and even the floor, which looked like he threw a towel over. The kitchen is a pile of dishes that are full of rotted food and mold.

I'm all in on helping my friend. And I started today by just ridding the place of trash, but obviously it goes deeper. He hasn't worked in years, but had so much in savings he could afford to do this. I'm taking him to a doctor on Saturday morning to get a full check out, and after that he'll be staying somewhere else for a few days so I can really clean up his apartment. I mean new sheets, dishes, toilet seat that works for him, clean all the laundry, organize the place....etc.

I'm also going to try to get him on disability because he has no source of income and no chance of having one for at least a year, and he can't provide for himself.

This came out of nowhere this week. All of my friends have tried to contact him multiple times a month for years, and maybe once every 6 months we get a text back, but that's it. All the sudden he has asked for help, but only from me and my brother, none of our other friends know, because he is too ashamed.

I guess I'm asking what way do I go about this? I'm just a straight forward, accomplish tasks kind of person, so this is new. I figured at least giving him a clean slate in a completely cleaned apartment might help, but I know it'll go further. I know a psychiatrist that will see him for free but I haven't broached that subject yet. I'll be over at least once a week just to keep him in touch with other people, but there is going to have to be some serious work done.

Didn't know where else to ask, and thought maybe somebody here has dealt with something similar or has any insight as to how he might be feeling. I thought this might help me figure out a plan. He really is one of the best people in the world, and myself, my brother, and when he's comfortable with it, the rest of his friends are there to help him, I've just never done something like this.",22Feb2019,1
12,"I know that I could just ask someone, but I don’t want people to think I’m crazy if it’s not real, and I’m usually alone anyway.

What I usually hear is what sounds like someone moving around my house when I’m home alone. But then when I try to focus on it I can’t hear it anymore. I don’t know if it’s just me being an idiot or if something’s up. 

A few weeks ago at school I thought I heard someone say “Hello?” over the intercom, but no one around me seemed to be saying anything about it. I didn’t ask anyone about it though. 
Just a few days ago I was hearing some sort of rhythmic tapping in my house. I was home alone so there was no one that could be doing it. 

Is it possible to hear random things like this?

I’ve never been checked out mentally or anything, but I don’t know if I should. I realize this stuff now, but when I was hearing it it scared the shit out of me. It’s so fucking scary to be home alone and then think someone is in my house.

13,Recently I've said something very stupid at work that I don't know if I can recover from.  I've been thinking over it for several days non-stop now and was just wondering if it's normal to worry this much over something.  Some of this also comes from having had seriously damaging rumors spread about me and now people don't believe that I'm legitimately having problems with a coworker because of the rumors that's already been going around.  If this workplace becomes so unhealthy to me mentally is it worth quitting over and finding a new job and getting a fresh start?  Should I care so much about what they already think about me?,22Feb2019,2

15,"I saw on the news paper i picked up. On the front page It was the Quebec mosque shooter. Sentanced 40 years minimum with 6 Victims who died that day. After having a short discussion about politics with a friend I realised that there's so much worse things happening out there that my problems are minimal and laughable. Because those families who lost their loved ones they are the true victims of life's atrocities and things like that in life happen too often.

I remember in highschool uttering insensitive attrocities thinking it was ""funny"" because It wasn't P.C. No that isn't funny. Where did I become insensitive anyways? I just wanted to be different because i knew I didn't matter on the grand scale of things. Labeled myself a Schizophrenic because i needed an identity to cover up my shitty behavioral upbringing. 

I feel retarded and sometimes I idealise running infront of a bus if it's going fast enough because all these meds make me feel weak and powerless. Where did all my goals and passions go? Why am I here? I wonder. If i could just keep it together through this day, the sun might be bright tomorrow...

Because just when I think I got it bad...why don't you show me someone who's got it a lot worse?
Mental health awareness is really important because community safety is #1. Helping someone out goes a long way even if it's a simple and small act of kindness. Connect with your community whenever you can and be there for one another.

17,"This is my first post so please bare with me, I’m just desperate and looking for answers. 

So today I get a text from my gf of a year and a half that she’s had a panic attack at work, and this is at least the third time this has happened since last August. She is an assistant at the local BAR association and deals with stressful work most days, including; phone calls, planning events, entering data on the computer, etc. Today, however, was a change of pace because she was at a luncheon with a bunch of lawyers/coworkers, which is when she had the panic attack. According to her boss she went “grey” and wasn’t being very social. Apparently she also almost got fired for this and it isn’t the first time it’s happened. 

Today happens to be the anniversary since she got an abortion, just a year ago. I begged her to keep the child bc it was 11 weeks at the time that she decided that she didn’t want it. I respected her decision the best I could, but never fully forgave her until about 6 months after due to the fact that the baby was healthy and he/she wasn’t a risk to my gf’s health. She regrets it even to this day I think, although a year ago isn’t when the problems began.

When this really began is shortly after we started dating. It’s like there always seems to be something wrong with her, before the abortion and obviously after, something has never seemed to be “okay” with her. Even when everything seems to be going fine, it isn’t fine (in her head at least). She seems to make-up and conjure problems that don’t exist almost out of thin air for no reason. At first I thought that I was the bad guy because she would tell me I was invalidating her feelings which was partially true, but I think it’s the “boy who cried wolf” scenario, due to the fact that there’s always something wrong. I’ve caught her cutting herself multiple times which I don’t even know what to do about. I think I should also add that when we first started dating that I would catch her lying about really small things that wouldn’t even matter, like what she ate for dinner, etc, although she doesn’t seem to anymore (she showed a lot of personality traits of a habitual liar).

In the time that we’ve been together (1.5 years), I’d have to say that she’s been to the doctor ~20-25 times. She does take medication for seizures which she hasn’t had one in over three years, and birth control. I’ve considered that she may have some type of mental illness that either hasn’t been diagnosed or something I’m not aware of. Honestly, I don’t know what is wrong with this person I care so deeply about, and this is sort of a last-ditch effort before I talk to a psychologist about it. I hate to sound selfish but I don’t know how much longer I can take her constantly being sick, or just being depressed and not feeling good in general, because it’s starting to take a mental toll on my happiness as well. 

If you have any opinions/questions I’m open to hear/answer them to hopefully get to the bottom of this.

19,"Through most of my 20s, I started a software development company which grew to be very successful over the span of 6 years. During this time, I was working remotely (with international partners/employees) from home, and putting in long hours. Due to my long hours, I lost contact with pretty much all my friends, and my mental health degraded. The only social activity I really did was online gaming with my colleagues. 

Eventually it got to a point where my mental health was not in a good place, and I sold my share in the company. From this, I had enough money to more-or-less retire on.

I spent the next 2 years unemployed, living with my girlfriend, and fighting to get out of the hole I'd fallen into. During this time I saw a therapist for the first time in my life, and was eventually diagnosed with Avoidant Personality Disorder, as well as displaying lots of traits of Dependant Personality Disorder.

My partner of 7 years and I broke up about 6 months ago, but things are okay. I'm a pretty happy person and I enjoy my simple life. I spend my time going on walks, reading, occasionally seeing the 2 friends I still have (they don't know each other), playing some videogames, cooking, and just doing whatever I feel like....

...however, I want more from my life. I want a great group of friends with whom I can go camping, play sports, have dinners, play board games, etc. I want to fight against my anxiety/depression. I want something a little bit more normal. My therapist stresses that getting a job is the best route forward for me, but that feels terrifying and impossible.

2 months ago, I was chatting with someone I knew from when I worked, and he suggested I apply to his company. A month of thorough interviews later, I got an offer. I started working last week, and I already want to quit. It's very similar to the work I used to do. I work remotely and sit on my computer at home all day. I've quickly made friends with the international people I work with (which is nice), and we have started playing videogames when we're done with work. 

It was such a big effort to get the job, and I feel proud of myself for having a job again... I think about going out and meeting people and actually being able to say I have a job and talk about it, instead of being ashamed and telling people that I don't work and don't do anything productive with my life.

However, I'm terrified it's going to consume my life like my prior job did. I want to quit. So much. I'd rather die than do this.

I have no idea what to do.

I go through daily routine, I wash my clothes, my house is relatively clean, my grades are good, but when it comes to me and my body, I have no idea how to take care of me.

I put off taking showers for days, I put off brushing teeth, taking meds, clipping nails, changing socks, cleaning my personal room,  etc. I don’t fee disgusting at school because I have no friends that I see during the day, only on Tuesdays. No one really comes near enough to make me self-conscious. I wear deodorant everyday but I know that’s not enough.

No one knows about this. My parents think it’s just procrastination, but really... I think I don’t feel like I’m worthy enough to take care of. 

Does anyone have advice or a solution to help me get back into a state of mind where I can care for myself?

By the 4th, I called back and said I was still having issues. She said the medicine should already be out of my system and she couldn’t do anything for me. 

I’m on my third week and I’ve spent most of the time on a bland diet and missing so much work. I have extreme nausea, shakes, diarrhea, some vomiting, and am tired. I feel like I’m sick all the time.

I ended up going to Urgent Care and the doctor told me that that medicine has a longer half life and I will experience these side effects for weeks.

35,"This the third post I'm doing on this. First one was on r/offmychest amd the second one was r/advice . My account was 15 days old, but I've been on reddit for years before actually making an account. Anyway, ever since childhood, I've been going through crap. Constantly being bullied and demeaned by classmates and teachers. Racism against me (I'm black btw). My parents are not much help either. Let me start from the beginning...

In preschool, I apparently never talked to anyone. My parents and teachers thought that I was having trouble talking in general. I had to take speech classes to ""improve"" my speaking. In all honesty, looking back at it, I was flying through every single lesson in the class. Anyway, I was held from going into Kindergarden for a year. What a great start. I remember getting constantly yelled at by my parentsand I know I was spanked and things like that. I cannot remember any of it. It kind of bothers me tbh.

Fast forward to 2nd grade, at this time, this is when things started to get a little messed up. My 2nd teacher always seemed to be pointing me out in the middle of the class for something. Like if I did bad on a test or something like that. I was very curious back then. So naturally, I would be accidently getting into trouble. I was never a trouble maker. I just got myself into bad situations. This would seem to be the case for the years to come.

5th grade.... My dad had to have brain surgery (2nd of 3). I just watched him have a seizure the day we were supposed to leave for vacation. Seeing something like this is not really good. My mom blamed me for not doing anything when I was standing there frozen. She yelled at me as the ambulance was picking him up. This was also the time where I remember the presence of a voice in my head. Despite contrary belief, it was a happy voice. Like an angel. But I still felt destroyed. I tried hurting myself in school one day. I do not remember any of the events leading up to it, I only remember cutting myself for some strange reason. I got caught. My parents were yelling at me. Telling me that I was ""Just trying to get attention"". And that I was ""Ungrateful for what I have"". I get this, but it is very debilitating to be saying that everytime I became sad or depressed. It was such a let down. Eventually, I stopped feeling a lot of emotions.

Cut to highschool. Middle school consisted  of bullying, racism, and very strict parents. I was scoring high on these tests that show your supposed to be in ""higher level classes"" but obviously there was something going on to stop it. Anyway in highschool, I felt as if my parents were living through me. Telling me go to college, doing sports and bring home trophies. Already talking about giving them grandkids. Mind you, they kept me from getting into any relationships and despised any talk of girls. At this point, I stopped telling them about me. I distanced myself from them. But in highschool, I was doing bad in an English class. She gave me a D on my first paper(totally not my fault. Every other english I have taken up to this point in college I've aced). I had to go in to parent teacher confrences. Basically, it was me getting yelled at and blamed for everything on the paper in front of the teacher. The presence of another voice came. This one was dark. I left my teacher and parents in the class because I just couldn't take it. I don't have much memory about the rest of the day. But that same year, my dad had another brain surgery. This one disabled him. I started to feel sad and dark all the time. Sports would help for a little bit, but not forever. I kept telling myself that I was being weak, I was ugly, wouldn't become anything. The voices in my head seemed to be different people though. They told me other things. Like one always wanted to take over. I just brushed it off as my imagination.

In highschool, everything went downhill. We didn't have money to go the college I got accepted into. My parents kept yelling at me and blaming me for how they feel. Telling me I'm lazy but I literally had to take the role as man of the house because my dad was disabled. I got offers for running and scholarships because of my grades and test scores, but I still couldn't go. I was getting sick of being home. I had a deep anger for my parents. I just wanted to leave. But I ended up having to stay home and go to a community college. I remember getting teased about not having enough money to get go. It really hit me hard.

Jump to college. My parents' toxicity was in full force. Constantly getting blamed for how they feel. I was studying to be an engineer but also was running( for some reason). I wasn't sleeping well at all. I was feeling dark. Let me tell you, that I wished to get into a relationship, but I am unable to develop love or a crush. I haven't felt the feeling of love since the 8th grade. I was never happy. And new voices came in. At this point, it was obvious they were like different people. One's name was Toby. Constantly crazy and a lot of energy. Impulsive... but funny at times. Extroverted. The others don't come a lot, but there is a dark one. He doesn't sound human.

I still brushed these voices off. But then the thoughts of suicide came. My grades were dropping, the family at home was being torn apart. I didn't have the motivation to do anything. I just didn't care. I blamed myself for everything. That I was making things up and just being weak.  I also have this other thing that has been going on since my childhood. I would stare off into space or blank out. Like I wasn't in my body. It was getting more apparent now that this was all going on. When it happened, I often don't remember what went on during that period of time. Like an intense daydream.  At this point, I went to get some help. Idk why I did. I just remember setting up an appointment with a psychologist.

This is all still going on today. But It is really bad now. I'm just coasting through everyday. Three of the ""voices"" seem to take over me at different points of time. I hinted to my psychologist as to what the people are, but I have not told her everything about it. I keep telling myself to stop my imagination from going wild, but they don't leave. They're not always there, and they're not always bad. Most of time they're pretty good or okay. My psychologist hinted as Depersonalization Disorder and Depression, but she doesn't know what to think of the people in my head.  I'm ashamed to let her know the whole thing. I'm really just sick of all of this. I want it to end, or become better at managing it. I can't really take this any longer. And my episodes of darkeness and sadness are getting worse. I feel like such a weakling.

37,"I'm a grad student in a health-related field, and part of the program is doing a semesterly clinical rotation. At my clinical rotation tomorrow, I have to act as the facilitator for an hour-long discussion group. The group is for people with acquired disabilities resulting from stroke, traumatic brain injury, brain cancer, etc.

I have never met or seen most of the people that will be in this discussion. I am supposed to somehow, as a young adult student, confidently advise a bunch of middle aged+ adults who have all kinds of different varieties/severities of disabilities and have experienced some really difficult stuff on how to reduce their daily stress. They are taking time out of their day and coming to the clinic just for this discussion group that I feel wholly unqualified to lead; I am an absolute nervous wreck and it's going to show. I apparently seemed so worried about it that my supervisor contacted one of our faculty members to ask if I was okay, then also called me tonight to see how I was feeling. This was super nice of her but I was literally just trying not to cry during the entire conversation because I'm panicking so much. I feel really embarrassed and like an idiot for being this upset; I'm in my last semester and this stuff should be easy at this point. It literally takes every bit of my energy just to go to my clinical placement every day and I'm barely even doing anything there because I'm so anxious. After 4 semesters of this I am physically and mentally beyond drained. My depression has also gotten really severe recently and I feel like I'm about to have a nervous breakdown. Not just over this thing tomorrow, but over my grad program in general.

Anyway, I have no idea how I'm going to get through this tomorrow; I honestly would not be surprised if I just ran out of the building. I don't feel skilled enough to facilitate a good discussion. I have a couple discussion questions to ask and an outline of some points my supervisor advised me to instruct on, but I have no idea how to find appropriate points in the conversation to transition into the points I'm supposed to make, how to make the conversation flow, how to get people to talk if they're not talking, what happens if the discussion ends too early, etc.

Sorry this got kind of long, I'm just asking if anyone has any advice about how to handle this, things to do to keep myself calm, techniques to facilitate discussion, etc.",22Feb2019,1
38,"My father is a psychopath that would constantly manipulate my sister and I since early childhood, he would constantly lie and was very narcissistic and manipulative, as well as emotionally and physically abusive.

Nor did the Easter bunny or tooth fairy. He refused to give us those little childhood things like Santa for some reason. He has never admitted to things he has done lives in a constant state denial of his actions. He is a bonafide narcissist and uses everyone with extreme angers. And absolute lack of remorse and empathy... extreme callousness. One day I had enough a month before I was to start high school and stopped going to his and speaking with him. I have not spent more than 3 hours with him in the Years since but I’m still forced to have contact with him more often than I’d like because sometimes I’m in need of his assistance financially (as he is my father and a child needs things at times) and every time I’m in contact with him it’s always unpleasant and he’s an asshole Atleast in some form whether he’s a smart ass or just all out abusive. I have endured a plethora of trauma in my life thanks to him and have healed and come along way and healed from a lifetime/childhood of abuse. But I still have anxiety and depression and occasional lack of emotion (because my whole childhood he never allowed me to have “feelings” whether it was happy sad or mad unless he was experiencing the same emotion at the same exact time for the same exact reason (which he rarely did).

I have gone through so much more than I could honestly write a book about and I remember new things every day. But I’ve grown a lot since I last lived with him.

I say this because...idk maybe it’s relevant? (Probs not)

Anyway, I recently been feeling really weird. I’ll try to explain as much as i can but it’s hard to explain. For the last month, almost 2, I’ve been having this feeling of being uncomfortable. Like something is wrong but i don’t know what. I wish i could explain it better but i just feel uncomfortable. It will come out of no where or when i feel self conscious. This is really abnormal since this feeling doesn’t usually happen but has been frequent recently. I just don’t know what to do. Sometimes it comes and internally i’m sobbing, like i feel my mind crying for some reason. Nothing in my life is going bad just the usual youngster trying to pay bills and make more money. I just came back from my dream vacation (Korea and Japan) and that trip really helped accept my mental health wasn’t actually okay like I liked to think. After i came back, maybe a couple weeks is when my uncomfortable feeling started to show up.

I don’t know, maybe someone can relate? I don’t know how else to explain it but i just feel right when it happens.

41,"Hey everyone,

I feel like the title mostly says it. I’ve had a lot going on in my life right now, and I haven’t been dealing with any of it very well lately. I’ve had issues with depression and anxiety since as long as I can remember, but it’s really different this time. I’ve been having these particular panic attacks on and off for around a month, but it’s been getting more and more consistent.

No one really notices because when I used to get panic attacks as a child, my mom would restrain me, and hold me tighter and tighter until I “calmed down” (she thought I was misbehaving). So it’s like I’ve learned to keep all signs of a panic attack deep inside of me. But it just feels like my brain is going to explode. It feels like fireworks inside my head, and also I keep constantly shaking, and having this weird metallic taste thing when I think directly of the thing that’s triggering it.

I keep having jaw pain in the night from clenching my teeth too much too. Does anyone know how I can ease this? I’m normally so good at calming myself down, but it’s been almost 3 days straight of pure panic attack, and I literally am out of solutions. It’s tremendously affecting my grades in school, and my work, as well as my relationships. I’ve already failed two exams because I couldn’t calm myself down enough to study, much less actually take the exam, I’ve been late to work constantly because I hardly even notice what time it is, and I feel like I can’t talk to anyone because their voice makes me want to punch a wall right now.",22Feb2019,1

Most people see me and I know they can tell I'm broken. Like they are looking at a fresh hot sh*t with A look of repulsion. And those who do get to know me and realize my struggles eventually in 1 week to 2 years distance themselves from me as though my existence is a curse upon them.  I'm very quiet, timid, shy, and mostly talk about things like weather or movies I like. Some friends have told me ""you're really nice and you are a good strong person.  You're really smart, talented and always there for me but, honestly I need different friends who can laugh and cry. It's nothing personal. ""

And when I try to force emotions to try and present as not autistic/dissociative people call me the r word, or avoid me for weeks or months after... leaving me to feel like shit for trying. But when I don't try I feel like crap for being a robotic person who no one can relate to.",22Feb2019,1

52,"I'm a fourth-year college student and have always struggled with my self-perception. I've never been medically assessed for anything mental health-related, so I was wondering if I should make that a priority. 

Some of my tendencies include extreme forgetfulness. I will often set down my phone and then two seconds later have to practically send out a search party to find it. Some things I do completely evade my memory recall. Every day, when I leave the house and get in my car, I will immediately forget if I locked the door or not. I've often had to turn around halfway to school because I can never remember if the door is locked, the oven is turned off, my bedroom light is off, or some combination of the three. 

It is very, very hard for me to focus in class. I'll listen to a lecture for just a few minutes out of a 50 minute class. When people are talking to me, I often don't listen to what they say. It's not that I don't care what they have to say; I just get bored. I'm sidetracked very easily, and my legs never stop jittering when I'm sitting down. I am tired nearly every waking moment of every day. It doesn't matter how much sleep I get.

(Is this the only sitcom with an irl name is both the main character name, AND the name of the show, aaaah that’s besides the point.) Seinfeld gets a love interest, and she’s EXACTLY like him, and the reason it doesn’t work out is because “I can’t date myself, I hate myself when it boils down to it.” I have a similar problem, but to put it bluntly I lack self love.

Okay, time to get solemn, but it legitimately hurts to have friends tell me I am hypocritical when I dislike their ways, only to realize that it’s MY way too. One of my best friends is basically Me 2, me but a slightly younger sequel. The traps that they fall into as a human being have really began to urk me, and it all leads back to me and my lack of self... existence.

57,"I started Wellbutrin and within a few days I started feeling like I have a tiny bit more energy. Then after a week, I went out to a bar with friends and stayed up all night. From then on I've been feeling really good and super productive. For the next 5 days or so I only needed 3-4 hours of sleep. Finally last night I got 7 hours of sleep, and even a 2 hour nap during the day. I still have a ton of energy though. I also have no appetite which I read can be an effect of Wellbutrin. 

Could Wellbutrin be working this fast? I wonder if it's the medication or staying up all night at the bar just messed up my sleep cycle. It's about 1am and I'm in bed although I do have a lot of energy still if I had something to do. 

Sooo idk. I'll see my psychiatrist first but I'm scared she will take me off it because I'm not getting a lot of sleep, and I don't want to go back to sleeping 12 hours a day and being tired and useless all the time. ",22Feb2019,1

Recently I’ve developed a verbal twitch to help with my anxiety. I quit my job at McDonald’s yesterday and I feel better but I’m lucky to still live with my mother. Anyway....

Things I will say out loud when I’m by myself, thinking of my circumstances and past events are things like “just fucking end it” “oh ffs” I can’t be arsed anymore” and other groans u might expect from physical pain.

The thing is I don’t feel suicidal, or at least think I don’t. I would jokingly “fantasise” about throwing myself in front of cars on the way home from work but I know I would never do it. Especially right now I am happy because I have time to find new work.

And I did get into a good uni, and things felt okay for a while, but now I'm starting to feel even worse that before, and I'm lonlier than ever.

64,"Ok so my friend absolutely hates our school and everyone in it (fair enough I guess), so he's trying to get into this really sort of loose, liberal, progressive school where he's convinced he'll be happy. The issue is that he just won't get in, you need to get A's in the subjects you're studying there and B's everywhere else, right now he's a consistent C/D student, maybe the occasional B. He's been struggling with depression and anxiety for the past few years, and it's slowly been getting worse. He's on anti-depressants and other meds and sees a psychiatrist every week. He's been suicidal before, and we know that if he doesn't get into that school, he will almost certainly end his life. 

Of course my friends and I have been trying to help him, but it's very difficult. Just last night when he was threatening to kill himself over a mildly offensive joke I made (it was an asians eat dogs joke which he saw as a personal attack against him because he's half chinese), he said that everyone in his life has disappointed or hurt him in some way. The issue is that it's impossible to help him. He knows he needs to work more to get into that school, but he's physically incapable of doing work, so he gets frustrated that he isn't working. Then, when his parents step in and force him to work, he gets frustrated because he hates his parents forcing him to do things. We've tried organising a work schedule for him or trying to create a more relaxed environment but he refuses to let us help. What he wants is our unconditional support for his actions no matter what, and that simply isn't possible when he has that 'everyone else is wrong' mindset because a lot of the time, he is wrong (I know that sounds narcissistic but obviously no one can be right 100% of the time), things such as in English class when we're writing stories and mine was about a rape victim, he got annoyed at me because it ""wasn't my story to tell"". Politics is also extremely important to him to the point where he genuinely thinks everyone who disagrees with him is against him, he's very far left (which isn't a problem I mean everyone is entitled to their opinions) but when I disagree with him and explain why he sees it as a personal attack, he ended one of his relationships because he found out the other person was a mild conservative. After my Asians eat dogs joke (for context, we could hear some dogs barking in the background on discord, my friend asked why the dogs sounded so in pain and I said they were still in the oven), he said he felt physically sick, his stomach hurt and he vomited. He believes no one is ever 'just joking' which is just BS, of course I'm going to stop making those kinds of jokes around him, but that isn't going to make a huge difference.

I realise i've gone on a bit, so thanks if you're still reading, I just wanted to give some insight as to what type of person he is. I'm basically asking what can we do to help him, he won't get into that school which means he'll have to stay at ours and he truly does hate it here (not liberal enough, too white are the reasons he gave us), if he has to put up with two more years he will kill himself, there's very little we can do to make the school any better for him (he's said in the past that he's an irrational person and everyone else should adapt to that). I realise this is a complex situation and it's probably unsolvable, but you never know, maybe someone will think of something we hadn't thought of yet. ",22Feb2019,1
65,"I got antianxiety medication about 4 days ago and has been on them for 2 days and everything is so.... Weird

Everything is so quiet, I'm relaxed but at the same time full of energy. I can actually keep a though in my head for almost a whole second before another thought bothers me. I can kiss my boyfriend without getting nervous. I do not care what the guy on the bus thinks of me, I do not care about having a muffin for desert and I do not stuff it all in my mouth all at once. I have a muffin next to me the last 4h and i have only had half of it! And when I woke up this morning I just, went up. Just like that. I did not lay there for a few minutes extra to muster the energy. I just... Went up. 

I'm catching myself waiting for the anxiety to kick in over and over again. When having to leave my house, when getting on the bus, when having to call a friend, when starting to think about stuff I need to do or when a automatic thought passes through my head. But it doesn't happen. Everything is just so... Still. Like something inside of me has switched off, like an organ that always has been there has stopped working. I didn't know my anxiety affected me this much

I noticed stuff I have never seen before, like when I got my glasses and I could suddenly read small text. How my boyfriend has little dimples on his cheeks, how dirty  our floor is,  how the pattern on the sofa is not the same all over. And all the colours! How shimmering my pets fur is and how the mat in out kitchen is not fitting in since it it so pink. How can I have missed that?

I have always thought I was not so bad off, I still had a good life and I could manage work and social contacts. But this! This is... Too easy

I feel high and it is so extremely weird

66,"Hi all,

As a brief introduction, I am a functioning depressive/anxious mess.  I hold down a job, I make myself look presentable, and I go out with friends and family but all the time I feel like a complete fraud.  I get so anxious and annoyed with myself, and have no idea why anyone even likes me.  Of course, then I get upset and depressed, causing me to withdraw, which makes me think of course no one should put up with how intolerable I am...etc. etc.

I am currently taking setraline, which takes the edge off of the anxiety and depression and lets me function better, but I still think there is something making me feel hollow and fake and false.  I sometimes feel like I'm just in a video game - that I'm not even really real if that makes sense.  

I have thus booked an appointment with a private therapist.  I have tried councilling through the NHS but CBT does NOT work for me because I don't see my thoughts as distorted, just honest (if I was less lazy I would work out - that's not a false statement, it's true!) And I tried, very hard, to work through their exercises and while it does help calm my anxiety spirals sometimes, it feels rather like taking an aspirin for a broken leg, rather than actually getting a cast put on (if that makes sense).  I have my first meeting with my therapist next Tuesday, and, true to form, I am panicking because I don't have any idea what to say to her. I am functioning as an adult, and I am so scared she will tell me to man the fuck up and get over it (in kinder terms, of course).

Any advice on how I could prepare? I have a journal set aside for notes and prep, so I can do some work over the weekend.

Thank you so much for your advice in advance.",22Feb2019,3
67,"So my partner had some issues that were related to low self-esteem and anxiety surrounding how other perceived him (there was no prior abuse or trauma to cause this it seemed more to be the stress of adulthood because he'd had everyone do everything for him before he moved out) so much that he gave up with everything and kinda hid from the world, depression hit him hard. He went to therapy and got help and he's doing so so much better now it's fantastic and I'm pleased for him. 
I only started therapy, my issues are a little more complex due to the reasons surrounding them. However, every time I try to talk to him about issues I'm having, he either relates it to his previous issues which has zero relevance or downplays the severity and accuses me of overexaggerating how bad it is. I know he doesn't mean it maliciously, I just think he truly doesn't understand the extent of it. 
For example, I have delusions, I at times genuinely believe every one I know is against me and are being malicious about me when I'm not there. I have zero evidence that this is happening and my friends are amazing people that constantly contradict this belief but I get so wrapped up in that thought that I isolate myself and cut contact with people. I even get full blown angry at them and complain about it to my partner (I am aware of how unhealthy and toxic this is and I am working on my own issues and to reiterate I do not shout at my friends or blame anyone directly it's just how I'm reacting at the time to my thoughts, I keep it to myself)
This is something I've addressed with my psychologist and we've spoken about how it's an issue, that's scratching the surface of the bullshit I pull, I am extremely emotionally unstable and that comes with anger issues, mistrust, guilt etc etc 
Despite this, my partner consistently points out my flaws, points out my irrationality (which in the best of times is fine but using it to invalidate all of my opinions is exhausting) and has said that it's possible that I think that they're worse than they are and that I'm not delusional because that word is apparently too strong to use and I'm not ""that bad"" 
Am I overreacting being annoyed at this? I feel like he's not taking me seriously and my issues seriously. I'm not really sure why he's so opposed to the fact that there's more to it than what he was dealing with (not that his wasn't awful I'm not meaning to compare there or trivialise his issues) I don't particularly want to be all over the place and feel as utterly horrible as I do and react the way I do but it's invalidating having someone pretend it's not ""that bad""

I'm currently working on the creation of a safe working space for people suffering from mental disorders that combines various elements.

the idea for this space is to regroup people with various mental health issues so that they would be able to work, exchange and have a creative zone for painting, crafts etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to combine these in a villa like space, where people can come to either spend a couple of hours (or their whole day if they'd like) in an area that would stimulate their productivity, and allow them at the same time to relax, given the fact that where i come from, mental health issues are still a taboo, we do not have group therapies or suitable spaces allowing people dealing with such disorders to come together for a jugment free experience exchange or  activities.

It's a space that aims to enhance productivity, creativity, while focusing on having an exchange zone where everyone would be able to trade ideas, experience etc.

75,"My entire life, from the time I first crawled to a window as a baby and saw a grey overcast sky and  this has been the tone of my life.

Depressed, tired, uninterested, mood swings, anger, frustration, short fuse, social issues abound, bizarre fascinations, addictions, job failures, just general failure to launch I suppose.

My mother and step dad said I was just a bad worthless child, tried to say I did not apply myself, yet scored higher than all my classmates except Christy that B...

I've always felt bored but swelling with anxiety, it never goes away unless I focus on a task, which works for a while, but then the task starts to become boring and the anxiety returns..

I can have a new hobby every month and I'll go bananas on it, then just never touch it again.

I can't seem to have ""normal"" relationships with women, only a small subset of quiet ex victim types understand and accept me, the rest could never understand why I can't hold a job for more than 2 years, or never want to socialize, or go out with friends.

So I end up with girls that are either from bad homes, or aspergers and that's the only joy in life for me.  She doesn't berate me or yell, she knows when I'm in need of support, she knows I will protect her and be faithful and I'm sure she is on the same page 

But lately even those girls I believe are giving up on me.  I'm 35 and about to lose the best job I've ever had.  I don't even know why.  I just woke up one day, decided I was too anxious, and now I can only describe it as physical manifestations of mental issues.   Lately my neck and back seem to always hurt, and my stomach... oh my..

I have spent 17 years in a therapist office, I've tried SSRI, anxiety meds, ADD meds, CBT, trauma therapy, and many others.

The meds literally make me crazy, and emotionally unstable, and yes I've tried basically all of them, I just felt groggy and had creepy thoughts like that I should start shaving my legs, I'm a guy...

The therapy seems to be all stuff I already internally know, and knowing it doesn't really help outside of just knowing it's not normal which creates more feelings of hopelessness.

So then I read about and started practicing a therapy that involves the changing of the epigenetic functions of DNA.  Basically it's practice makes perfect.  The theory goes that epigenetic switches get flipped on or off in childhood, which result in certain behavioral traits.  So by just changing your behavior and for example, not getting upset at small issues, over time you'll rewire the switches and voila, no more issues right?

Well it's been 5 years, still nothing.  Now I just am an actor essentially, because internally I still want to melt down and Say something mean.  And I'll still break down but now I wait until 2 AM cuz that's a good time for that..

Next something interesting happened.  My mom called me and said that my real father who I had never met was in town and wanted to meet me.

So I did.

I'm a fkn clone...  He moves like me, laughs like me, thinks like me, tells the same shitty jokes word for fkn word like me.  He has the same half witted logic, he is depressed all his life, can't hold jobs for long, struggles with relationships, drugs, alcohol, etc.  He at one point even explains how he had all these weird fascination in his youth that mirror mine to a T.

I'm a fkn clone.

So I realized pretty fast that I'm not a POS.  I just had a mother who apparently mated with and reproduced with someone that is this way.  

My question is to people that maybe are similar, did you ever find a way to eek joy out of employment?  Have better social skills?  Etc?  Or is my theory that we aren't as malleable accurate?

I mean, ""people don't change"" has been a mantra since before Rome...like, is it true?

Starting to feel like I'm more of a set actor than this free willed coin your own adventure person I believed I was.  I'm just a freaking clone of some random guy with lots of issues and now I have them too..

My first ex was a horrible, horrible person who manipulated me constantly and made me feel like shit. I feel, now, that I’ve done the same to Bea. 

We smoothed things over and agreed to meet and when we do, at the end, we usually kiss each other goodbye. That didn’t happen this time.

I got home safely, but sure enough my dad was waiting for me there, with that distinct face. I started to shout at him, threw away my  own Jesus necklace, and confronted him. I continued to smoke weed, but it just started getting worse. I invited my friend to play basketaball one evening, and that time I felt like there was this ""stoner's reality"" that I never knew about and I just found out about it. Like everything, from what people say how they say it, how they act, had every subliminal messages to it. Lyrics to music made ""sense"" and I remember having this ""little subliminal"" competition (or even hostility) towards my friend. I remember the guy we were playing with, he said ""Yeah.. this ball's alittle flat"" and I thought it's meaning that my personality/or soul was flat or too dark and I needed to get better. On our way home, I started to say and do weird things, I had the idea that we could go anywhere, that the freeway would lead us anywhere, and asked my friend if he wanted to go to ""China"". I remember blacking out, my friend had to get our other friend to drive us home. That was the start, I had more psychotic episodes, but within these episodes I had my own reality but I was conscious of my actions. I felt that the government was after me because I knew too much. I was admitted to the psych ward about 3 to 4 times, one time I even thought I was EazyE (my friend had me listen to alot of NWA) and later on I thought I was Jesus (damn  hahaha). So yeah, it was very bitter sweet, because all this happened during my senior year. At first my friends were trying to comfort me, but they did not realize that I was living in my own reality, I wasn't even conscious of it, the thing that separated us was that I was still conscious of what I was doing, but in my own reality. And I don't blame them, they had their own lives and couldn't tend to me forever. I got accepted to a good colleges, but it was too late, I dropped out of my AP classes and I wasn't sure if the colleges would still accept me. During this time period, I was on meds, gained alot of weight which made me even more depressed (I was athletic). Hardest and most humiliating thing was graduation, walking on stage, not who I once was and who people loved and knew me for, but what had happened to me (not blaming weed I love it, the memories I had with it with my friends I would not take back). Fast forward and yes bitter sweet, I went home to my original country, got to live with my mom again and my baby siblings, made new friends in College. Making friends wasn't the same though, sure we got close, but I did not have the guts to tell them my past. Fast forward again, I moved back to the States to study (one reason was that I had alittle ""psychotic"" episode during a smoke party at a party and I felt like my new friends started to have a different impression of me). During my stay in the states, I took off time from Community college to have a vacation with my mom and family, to some other country. There, I had the craziest psychotic episode. I woke up, mom got a doctor, and asked me if I wanted to come back to the states or go home with them, again. I said go home. When I got back, I was set to go to the same University again. But social media fucked my life up (again, happened during the start of my psychosis in high school). I was acting weird, posting stuff that was weird and provocative. The new friends I've made in the University started to have a different impression of me, worse than what happened to me with my old friends in high school. Fast forward to now, now I feel that I'm at least happier, because I feel that I can embrace my mental illness, although unfortunate, I have to live with it. I feel that it's God (or the universe) testing me, because to be honest all my life I never struggled, my old HS friends would always ask why I'm never in a bad mood. Maybe it's God making me a stronger, more mature person. But yeah,  It's been hard making friends \[I don't have any (maybe 3 but very distant), but I'm lucky enough to have my Gf stick with me through everything, she was there during the vacation\]. I say it's hard making new friends because I don't want to hide my mental illness anymore, I want people to know about it because like I said before making friends who do not know everything about you just does not feel right, it's not real, I feel. And plus, I go to a small university, so everyone knows each other, I made a lot of friends freshman year, so that means word got around and people know. And yeah, I don't blame them for not wanting to be friends with me anymore, they have reasons to, and I'm okay with it. The only thing that scares me is if I will get another chance in life, after college, to have a normal life, normal social life, things like that. I was never socially awkward, I was always outgoing and I still am, but yeah what holds me back is my past and the impression I've made on everyone. I've been wanting to post this for a long time, and I'm not expecting much, but maybe just insights (maybe same experiences?). Insights on if I will ever get another chance in life, but if I ever do, I believe that I've learned enough from my past and it's made me a better person, plus I often take for granted being with my mom and little siblings (I love being with them everyday) and my Gf who is still with me throughout everything. Thank you! ASAP Rocky saved my life (First two albums) I'm ego-tistic about my looks but hey, it helped me lose weight and be happy again, certain songs ""Alot"" by 21 savage, ""Truly Yours"", more, and Kota the Friend! Sorry I tend to lose track and keep on writing, always been me. But yeah if you're going through the same experiences maybe let's exchange music and stuff, keeps a lot of us going. Thank you again!",22Feb2019,2

As a child I'd obsess with counting stairs, small everyday things, but I never really put much thought into it or considered it a problem in the long term. But in the past 10 years I have been tormented night and day by one or two failed relationships, little more than flings in fact, and I thought it was just me being a weak person that was unable to get over them... but after reading this article about Relationship OCD, the maddeningly repetitive and obscene quality to it all seems eerily familiar.

&amp;#x200B;

When I got dumped, thoughts pertaining to it would play on a loop day and night for years. Then, in turn, these thoughts gradually merged into thoughts of suicide that were equally repetitive and appalling. I never had any real intention to enact them, but at the same time I couldn't stop thinking these thoughts. It drove me to the edge of utter madness and deep into an alcohol problem. And yet all the same, I somehow never quite considered the thoughts themselves to be the problem, rather (perhaps foolishly) assuming that the things they pointed to in reality were the problem.

&amp;#x200B;

This article is very thought provoking and makes me wonder if there really is an OCD element to my problems. In fact right now I seem to be drowning in relationship OCD like the article mentions above. I'm on the verge of breaking up a relationship of 7 years because I feel so insecure and nervous when it comes to planning a future together and marriage etc. Mostly because my mind seems open to all possibilities at all times, and the likelihood of this decision being the ""right"" one tortuously small. The only relief I get from such thoughts, in general terms, is when I'm in the first throes of infatuation - where there &lt;i&gt;can be&lt;/i&gt; no mistake as my mind cries continuously for this person. Needless to say such a relationship always (understandably) ultimately ends up repelling them. And so the cycle continues.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm not counting stairs any more... I check I locked the front door in the mornings 3-5 times and tap the wall next to it in a certain pattern that I can recall it later so as to be sure that I did indeed lock the door when leaving for work. When I go on holiday, I even film myself locking the door with sound and jiggling the knob to be sure. If I do not do this, my mind is constantly ""testing"" my memory and questioning my grasp of reality in regards to whether I truly remember things happening or not. Memory itself seems to slip through one's hands, no matter the repetition or the self-flagellation that accompanied them.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had these kinds of repetitive, maddening, often obscene thoughts for many years. Over time they morph slowly and seamlessly into different forms on different subjects. Sometimes it's politics, sometimes it's relationships, job concerns, my own personal inadequacies in one form or another (a particularly pleasant way in which my mind enjoyed tormenting me was to keep calling me homophobic names and filling my mind with thoughts and images that, let's say, I was less than thrilled to have). I am so tired of it all. Sometimes it's hard to tell what feelings are real and false, what thoughts are merely the background static that fills my mind and what are genuine.

&amp;#x200B;

Which brings me back to the subject of the article to which I refer above. It's too hard to know whether I'm in the right relationship or not, I am very happy much of the time, she is my favourite person and best friend in the world, but because I am not obsessive and infatuated, it torments me... on and on and on, and it seems only leaving her will end it.

Any thoughts? I've got more than enough but they never quite seem to go anywhere helpful...

88,"this is a rant about the insensitive people out there who make me feel like shit about myself 

i’m writing this because the other day i was sitting with two of my friends, and somehow my mental health came up. 
their hearts may have been in the right places and they tried to make me “feel better”. they told me that i was such a great person and that i should get off of medication. one of them said that she was on antidepressants but she stopped that and started eating right and loving herself and now she’s much better. my other friend said that she was going through “exactly” what i was going through, and that if she went to a psychiatrist she’d get the same diagnoses BUT she’s handling it on her own and is managing fine. 
as someone who is always doubting whether i have the “right” to be labeled with anxiety and depression these comments really hurt me. when people say stuff like that it detracts from our struggle. you think we like medication? we don’t. you think we’re weaker than you because we can’t “handle it” by ourselves? we’re not.

89,"I do not live the life of a depressed or associate with the typically sad person. Understanding the feelings, solidifying the experiences or attempting to vicaroiusly interpret their lives is all very difficult for me. Helping someone help themselves or helping someone want to help themselves in the first place or even get them to want help. I do not know. I do not know why my attempts have been incapacitated, my gentle hand slapped away like an buzzing wasp, my cries of empathy silenced like a phone on silent, a sense of uselessness and helplessness has taken over my being and I cannot easily visualize a timely, favorable solution. I want to articulate my current thoughts as well as hear the thoughts of others more wise than me.

The sad person will favor depression over happiness, sadness over joy, and pain over comfort because underlying problems have not been forgiven. 

Abuse suffered in the past may destroy all feelings of happiness and security. Torment becomes the normal and everything seems hopeless causing death to be, although permanent solution, a blissful vacation from the pain. When in this state of seemingly perpetual pain, a coping mechanism of apathy takes hold, a desire to escape circumstances dries out will the last of tears and the seeds of the biggest problem, low self-esteem take semi-permanent root. 

Sad person may not even of suffered from abuse but still prefers the sad life personified in loneliness. Whether from abuse or failed relationships for some reason sad person feels alone. This can be purposeful but hardly ever desirable. Deep down every person longs for human connection, only too often it is disturbed, misconstrued, and manipulated by pungent fiends poisoning the vulnerable for selfish desire. Bad relationships all around him, sometimes not even being his own, set poor examples and influence the ideas of what a good relationship means, giving way to a more favorable existence in loneliness. A hedgehog who loves connection but only hurts himself and arguably more importantly hurts others.

The sad person is often lonely and has low self-esteem so what purpose is it to get close to people when you will only become a burden. Sad person will wrongly interprets the avoidance of vulnerability and lack of openness as healthy and superior to the possibility of opening up and getting hurt. If the event of a  relationship occurs, sad person automatically places himself in a lower standing than the other recipient which makes sad person content with being used or mistreated. The sad person can keep up this superficial relationship in the following ways: He does not open up, he can please his own selfish and confused desires, he can artificially fill the void of loneliness with a connection, or experiment with others emotions.  
Unfortunately, the sad person may be so lonely that he needs the negative attention of being depressed. He will play sad music, (simp songs are welcome to be recommended) eat himself to the point of self-loathing, post on social media and worst of all use others. This is where it may get personal for me and now that I have had time to realize my past actions I am sincere in saying I am not proud and rather disappointed I acted this way. Many times throughout my I played the apologetic victim. Although I took some measure of personal responsibility it was for my own convenience, never being sincere enough to makeup for my wrong doings. In this victimhood state I merited negative attention. By exaggerating my emotional turmoil , prolonging and perpetuating my problems, I essentially created an artificial system in which being sad would provide more attention to myself and affirmation to my ego. Going back to the sad person, (Although these tendencies do not cease to arise, I have become more conscious of it and try actively to fight back) craves this negative attention because that is the only way he will feel valuable. Fishing for compliments and degrading himself will often warrant arguments and words of affirmation from the person the sad person decided to use. 
    
Finally, the sad person does not want help. He chooses to be sad as a person chooses to be scared at a horror film. Where he goes wrong is life is not a horror film. There are always the absolutes of uncertainty in life where emotions can flare and life can go wrong. Moderation of emotions is essential. One cannot go about a healthy life feelings only anger or only joy. Balance as show in the movie inside out, gives a decent explanation of what I am trying to convey. Emotions come and go therefore not being consistent paradigms in which our lives should flow. In order to live a meaningful life everyone must find healthy and sustainable coping devices to enable them to survive the menacing yet opportunity rich variability in life. If not the sad person will decide that their life is a horror movie or a tragedy and never pick themselves up out of the pit of loneliness and despair. 

As humans we all have chains. Some chains we will be able to escape ourselves, in fact most chains were locked by the very person they imprison. What the sad person and many persons fail to realize is people may not have the same chains as us or even the identical chains can be unlocked by others, by friends, and by family. They may have the key you yourself do not hold.

We also always use protection and insure that no condoms have hole in them after sex. 

So I guess I just need to know what's going on with my girlfriend. She woke up this morning and suddenly just started throwing up. She couldn't stop. It went of for a while and it's kinda slowed down. But I'm really worried.

95,"This is a long story but here goes.

I've suffered with depression for most of my life and anxiety the past 4 years. I'm 24. Recently, someone very important to me died. He was like a father figure. It's been nearly 3-4 months since then. A few weeks ago, if not before that, my emotions I felt became numb-er. And it kept getting worse. I feel completely emotionally numb. It's terrifying. My thoughts are darker and my responses shorter and uncaring.

I've still been acting like a good person but it is based rather on how I used to act rather than how I feel. Like I have this setting of this is what I would have done because it's right so I do that, but I'm very unsure if it's out of goodness or just knowing societal norms and rules.

I'm 24 as I said and used to be a very mature and kind person. I still am but it feels forced. 

I just got out of an inpatient mental health clinic and felt slightly better but before long it went right back to this. 

It's so bad that when I see my dogs, or friends or even talk to my family, I feel like I'm pretending to care rather than actually caring, and it is so recent that this happened that I'm terrified something is truly wrong with me.

Is this just extreme depression, or am I becoming a sociopath?

96,"So I was In the hospital for trying to hurt myself, and of course they do their whole work up. These feelings only started a couple months ago for the most part but they've gotten increasingly worse. The first main part I suppose Is the paranoia, crippling paranoia, almost feeling like ocd in a way too. Like thinking everyone is talking about you or making fun of you, to think that my best friend is plotting against me because she secretly doesn't like me. This led to me thinking my roommate was going to try to kill me so I threw a bunch of stuff in front of my door. I haven't really heard voices but I constantly just get these terrible feelings or thoughts in my head about myself or about what other people think about me. Also feeling like Im not completely in control of my senses, like feeling like Im going to fall into the sky. Early yesterday morning though I had this one episode where I was laying in bed and I thought I had gone to work and had all these conversations and done all of these things, only to come to to yelling that wasn't there. It wasn't a dream but It felt like one if that makes any sense. Ive been dealing with massive depression and have a diagnosis for ptsd as well, does anyone else have symptoms like this?

99,"(Sorry for the probably broken English, it's not my first language)

Don't really know how to start this, but, it's been in my head for a long time and I need to at least vent.

The thing is that I always get bored or tired of people out of nowhere. Like, I could be in the best moment of our relationship and from nowhere they become annoying and I don't want to be with them or having them around me.

I have noticed something about this, it only happens when my relation with the other person gets too deep. When we start to make a stronger bond. When that happens, I can't stand them, I don't like them, their voices seem too loud and I want them to shut up. I thought that it maybe was because I'm afraid of deep bonds. I don't know.

The problem keeps going when, like, the next morning or next 5 minutes I WANT TO BE WITH THEM AGAIN. I don't fucking understand myself. I push them away but then regret it. What is wrong with me.

The worst part is that sometimes I don't talk to them because I don't feel like being with them but I talk with other people like it's nothing. And bro, that's some fucked up shit right there, I'm hurting them and I know and I'm being the worst person and friend at the same time. I don't why they stay around, I don't deserve them they should go away.

This shit has ruined 3 friendships and I hurted people by pushing them away. And now I don't want to have friends because I feel that it's just going to be the same shit again. We meet, we start to know each other, we get a stronger bond and then I go through a change of episodies where I can't stand them and where I love them.

And I don't want to be a bad person, I tried to have other frienships after the first one so I could do better but I just fucked it up again. And these friends got hurt, they didn't deserve it.

All of us have to face the second day whether we want to or not. It was day two of her broken heart. She knew that this day would come, but never expected it to be so soon. We are never prepared for heartbreak no matter how many times we go through it. At the end of every wave a new one is waiting. Winter has overstayed its welcome. Another rainy day in Portland. Not a surprise. There is so much water coming from the sky you begin to question how this is even possible. Same routine of waking up, eating breakfast, and taking way too long to get ready. Keep in mind that this day is a little different. Today is the second day. The second day of a heartbreak hangover. She looks down at her phone but all that stares back at her is her frozen wallpaper. A picture frozen in time of a memory that once was. She looks over the text messages shared from the night before praying that this is all a dream. The second day is the worse because you are in denial. You want to go back to the day before and do things right. You feel like you’re running through quicksand. All she wants to do is run away, but the second day clings onto her. Every move she makes is a task and all she wants to do is hide from the world. She has been living in this rainy city for six months now and still isn’t used to the sky always weeping. Flinching at every tiny droplet that greets her glasses. Being surprised that the weather causes her to see her own breath with every exhale. The best place to run away is the park under the steel green bridge. It is a place that welcomes you with open arms. It is a place that is in the sky, away from the rest of the world. On this particularly cold day, there wasn’t a soul in sight. Just a heartbroken girl and her bright red bleeding car. She grabbed her camera, locked the car, and started walking. Having no destination or end goal. The red car became a sight for sore eyes among the gray and green. Walking further and further the bleeding car disappeared into the background. What came into focus is the larger than life sign that says LOVE. As if this sign is meant to mock her. As if the sign forces her to feel something. Annoyed at the world, and annoyed at herself she continues walking. Not knowing how she got there she is greeted by a large piece of rusty metal. It is the start of the old fishing dock that many couples use as a “lovers lane” so to speak. Kisses are shared as they watch the sunset tower over a massive piece of green steel. Today is different. Today is the second day. It is cold and rainy, without a single soul in sight. Just a girl with a broken heart and her bright red bleeding car. One step and then another. All she can hear are the muffled screams of the cars above and the squeaky sounds of the lonely dock. Her hands are numb and blue. Each breeze brings a mini storm of water against her glass vision. She doesn’t care because the cold weather is the only thing that reminds her that she is still alive. Her lungs become sore from the cold air, but again she doesn’t care. She keeps pressing the shutter button on her camera. That is the only thing that is important. Nothing else matters in this moment besides the quick flicker of her camera. The dock begins to sway aggressively demanding her attention. She gives into the plead and begins to take notice of her surroundings. Something  suddenly draws her to the idea of laying down on the dock. She lets the dock take her. Each aggressive sway makes her lose more and more of her touch with reality. We all hate the second day because it demands you to feel something. Even if you find a sneaky way to avoid the second day, it will find a way. It always does. Whether it be the first day or the hundredth day. The second day is the day you let dock sway you from side to side. The second day is the day you finally take notice.   ",22Feb2019,1

She's been previously diagnosed and taken medication for some kind of disorder that exhibited paranoia but I'm unsure of what the actual diagnosis was. Not sure if it was paranoid schizophrenia or something else. I was a little kid when she stopped taking her meds.

I know she's been off her meds for years and always refused to talk about starting them again. For the most part she's seemed asymptomatic and able to cope just fine and I didn't think much about it. Eventually we all just stopped talking about it. Recently though she's been exhibiting more and more paranoid tendencies. She rents a room in someone's house and is 100% sure there's people in the attic, her phone spies on her, people follow her etc... all in about a year's time. (I've noticed her talking about them more and more seriously over the last maybe 3 months) But she's never acted on anything that I was aware of. 

Today she told me she had previously expressed to her landlady that she wants to check out the attic because there's something up there and had been expressly barred from going up there. So of course my mother went directly to Lowe's and bought a $70.00 ladder so she could check out the attic. Her landlady found her and there was apparently an argument... the ladder has been returned but the damage is probably done there.

It's obvious that her paranoia issues are worse than I thought, and now they're affecting her ability to have a place to live. If she continues without getting some kind of treatment I'm afraid things will get worse for her and she could also end up without a place to live.

I'm not sure how to go about a conversation with her about getting some help. I'm not even sure what a roadmap for treatment would look like for her. If I can(or should) involve her doctor? She's on Medicare and has a very limited income so I'm not even sure if she can afford the medication she might need. Anyone with experience having this sort of conversation with a loved one know what kind of things work vs. what doesn't? I'm expecting she'll get angry and dismissive when I bring it up but I'm not sure if there's a ""good"" way to force the issue? (For lack of a better word) ",22Feb2019,1

110,"Let me start with a little bit of a back story. I grew up in the middle of a big city and had a pretty good childhood besides some financial trouble until I was 8 (which have never risen since). I was always an overachiever and always topped my class. I was also captain of my football (soccer) team which is why I was often the centre of attention among my friends and family. 

My life peaked in 2016 when I was physically and mentally at my fittest, had an offer to one of the best universities in the world and a steady girlfriend.

Since I graduated from school and was ready for uni my life has been a downward spiral and I’m nowhere near as confident as I used to be. Despite of that, I still think I’m better than most people when I’m clearly not and tend to put off work thinking I can easily do it just before the deadline. I manipulate everyone including my parents and to get what I want out of them.

I’m a liar and I lie for no reason whatsoever even if it doesn’t portray me as a better person. For example, I lied about not liking ice cream to a girl I was on a date with and we weren’t even talking about ice cream. I manipulate the girls I date and charm them into thinking I will be there forever and when the time for commitment arrives, I drop everything and move on to the next one. 

I’m also addicted to sex and I do everything with only one motive in mind: to get laid. I work out to get laid, I play music to get laid and I only date to get laid.

Now that I’ve painted this picture of me, I know I sound like a horrible person and I am. I cheated on my ex girlfriend of 2 years for no reason at all besides the thrill of it while I was completely in control of my actions and I manipulated her into thinking it was her fault. I ruined the next few years for her just so I wouldn’t have to face the blame and I hate myself for it now.

I’m not motivated to work anymore, I can’t do anything. I sit at home and never leave my room. I reflect on my actions from the past and they make me hate myself more. I keep wanting to go back in time and changing things and making the people that made me happy happy. I know I can’t do that but I can still change. I often have suicidal thoughts but I know I’ll never do it. It just gets worse everyday and I don’t want to reach the level of self hatred where my stance about suicide will change. Please help me, tell me what is wrong with me and please tell me where I can get help.

113,"Hey guys, my name is Anthony. I'm 27 and when I was 19  I was hospitalized for anorexia and anxiety.  It took a few years for me to get to this point however when it all went wrong it really happened fast.  I think I had my first bout of anxiety when I was around age 8, at least that was the time I had my first therapist.  I saw various therapists over those years, with the earlier ones trying to work out why I was misbehaving rather than what my troubles actually were.  I guess they figured they had another ADHD kid on their hands they could simply give a star chart too and  encourage Mum to make sure they get their s\*\*\* together.  

When I did finally go to hospital I was relieved.  I was terrified of what was to become of me if I did not get urgent help.  Although hospital was extremely difficult for me and forced me to overcome challenges I hadn't even imagined, I can now comfortably say it was one of the best things that ever happened to me.  Upon gaining my weight back I left hospital medicated and on  the real path to recovery.  Over the next few years I started to develop a mindset which I constructed from the  experiences of others that were just like mine but perhaps they were doing a little bit better.  I often say that nobody has all the answers,  if they did  they would only ever be one self-help book but there's not there's thousands.  so it's my belief that's the best thing you can do to overcome your mental health challenges is to open up to others and allow them to open up to you.  By doing this we share information with each other that we would otherwise hide for fear of shame  or ridicule.  but it's my personal promise that if you trust in the natural gift of communication,  and not just talk but listen,  you can expand your own set of tools to deal with this ever-increasing challenging world. Perhaps the first person you speak to will not understand you and that's okay.  Maybe the first 10 won't have a clue where you're coming from, but that's okay too.  However, occasionally you will meet someone you are so aligned with that you will probably just burst into laughter at the similarity.  

This is how we learn. We share information and learn from each other the same way as we do with all the other subjects that we are so far advanced in.  Why does Moore's Law work for technology but not mental health?  Maybe the reason is that we don't talk about it and we don't work together to get to the next level.  I urge you, please, if you are going through something today to talk to somebody, because it might just turn out they're the person who is just like you. Maybe they're waiting for someone like you to talk to them too.

I will be documenting more of my thoughts and my journey on my YouTube channel Another Point of View.  I would love your support to reach as many people as possible with not only my message but interviews I will be conducting with others to tell their stories about how they overcame their challenges.  If you would like to talk to me and perhaps be willing to open up in front of others to help them, get in touch. I would love to speak to you.

I truly hope you're all having incredible day.  Anthony.

She also thinks she has social anxiety. But in reality, she’s socially awkward because she’s basically been homeschooled her whole life.

116,"Hi! I have been the happiest I’ve ever been for the past few months, I’ve always struggled with my weight and I work a 9-5 job! I’ve been consistent in working out, eating healthy and just having my little routine and I’ve found that the gym is something that helps manage my negative feelings! When I am in the swing of this it effects all other areas of my life in a positive way also. Such as wanting to socialise, feeling good about myself. Last week I had to go into surgery to remove an lump on my back and as a result of this I have been signed off of work, strictly no gym and out of my routine which means I’ve been at home, when I’m at home I tend to just binge because I don’t have a routine. 

It’s a week in and I feel so low and depressed and I don’t know what to do, my boyfriend hasn’t been there much because he has had a friend over from overseas and he is the host so he can’t leave him.

117,"I""ve suffered with depression and anxiety about 2 years now. I have been on lexapro 15mg and am going to see a psychologist soon but I need help coping at work at the minute.

About 3 weeks ago a girl who works in the same office as me came onto me. I took her out for coffee and thought that went terrible but she said thanks to me and gave me her number so I could take her for dinner. I took her out and thought it went well but she went cold on me for the next week. She didn't reach out to me and just smiled and said hi as I'd walk by her. I started researching this online and read some posts about how I should have been flirting better and escalating more with touch etc. This made me feel terrible. I'm a very nervous guy and that clearly turned her off me.

This week she opened up a bit more to me but the attraction is definitely dead now. Any time I see her now I almost go into an anxiety attack. If I see other guys flirting with her that makes it even worse. I can't help but feel like shit because she was clearly physically attracted to me but I fucked it up by being a nervous, shy guy.

Clearly I'm not here for dating advice but I want to be able to move on from this and not let it ruin my work life and personal life. She's gone out tonight and the thought of one of those guys who was flirting with her during the week getting with her after her being so direct with me about her intentions makes me feel physically sick.

Background

For your information, I am a 26 years old, female from Canada. 

At 19, I was brought as an inpatient for about 3 months. In hospital, I was diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder (depressive type) as well as severe anxiety. It was also my first suicide attempt. 3 months later, going outpatient, a new doctor was attributed to me changed my diagnostis to Borderline, because she thought I was making everything up for attention and told me to stop talking about some of my symptoms because she would take ""none of that nonsense"". She cancelled my assistance-dog application and refused to renew some of my medication. She used to make me feel very inferior and not taken seriously, but it's the only one I had and considering I had to almost die to get one, I didn't have much options here but to suck it up. 

I stopped going in therapy after a year or two and bottled it all. Kept having symptoms, but I became very good at hiding them. Anytime I would hear voices, get a panick attack because of my delusions or any other variety of these symptoms, I would just seclude myself at work and then go home claiming to have a sudden case of the flu or gastro. I've done a few suicide attempts here and there, but no one ever found out about those. Therefore, I now have a high rate of absence at work. Fortunately for me, since I do my job going above and beyond in regards to what is expected for my position, so my boss and colleagues are understanding and let it go. 

\*\*\*

Before this event, I used to be quite good in school;  I was having good grades, doing ballet and my parents had high expectations for me. I was ""the intelligent one"", despite not having many success socially (my first friends were made in grade 11th). At around 20, I was in and out of college repeatedly until I just could not go back anymore (22). I always resented myself for it, for not being ""normal"" enough and be unable to do things that everyone else could do, like getting a diploma. Despite my dream to become a veterinarian, I had to make a cross on it. 

The reason why I never had many success socially, even younger, was mostly due to my inability to trust others on a personal level. I don't open up to people and it makes it hard for others to relate to me. So, at work, I'm a bit of a doormat and I hide my feelings the best I can. I'm this happy person, never grumpy or angry and always there to help everyone around, always taking care of others. Coworkers refers to me as their office ""grandmother"", despite me being much younger than most of them.  And if there is anything outside of office hours or people asking me to hang out, I simply refuse. 

My survival instinct was and is always : make yourself as little as possible, don't take too much space, and everything will be fine.

\*\*\*

Today, I have a little appartment, a nice job despite having no diploma, and an amazing boyfriend. I am priviledged, lots of people with similar situations don't have it so good. He is aware of my mental problems, but I do not disclose everything. He truly is the best person and I could certainly tell him, but I am so used to just hide what I feel that I can't bring myself to do it. His family has been dealing with mental illness and I could see how it hurts him. I don't want to be the source of his pain (or anyone's pain). My cat and him are the glue holding me down here. Whenever I have a panick attack or an urge to jump in front of a train, I think of them.  

I feel like I'm just forever stuck in this loop. I can't work toward anything, I can't sleep properly, I can't concentrate, I can't make friends like a normal human being. I'm just this shell of a person and it just hurts to be alive.  I accepted to go see my old psychiatrist again, but I'll probably be then again dismissed and sent back home with the ""you're faking"" speech and seing a new one could up to years.  

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully, someone can point me to a direction, any. I'll take it. 

Thank you.

Not just that, though, there's other noises. It's mainly chewing gum, but also the sound of licking and slurping (basically anything involving a tongue), certain peoples' voices, some noises or clicking that people make, crickets (since i have a chameleon i always have crickets in my room), and humming. I feel dumb because obviously everyone hates these things too and finds it annoying, but I feel like it isn't normal how much I hate them. It also seems like its getting worse as I get older. I sit in classrooms all day listening to people eating and I can't focus. I scratch at my skin trying to ignore it, I plug my ears(sometimes so intensely it hurts after a while), I clench my jaw, I completely tense up, and I just, in general, feel like screaming. I feel dumb also because I feel like it's stupid how it makes me feel. It's just a general noise, so why does it literally cloud my thoughts and kinda make me want to hurt myself?

My ""ex"" (36M) and I (35F) have been battling an on and off relationship for nearly two years. From the beginning, although we got along well, red flags and issues were flying all over.  He had a drinking problem, which he openly admitted to from the first week.  I have issues with depression and anxiety, which I openly admitted to from our first date. We seemed to accept these issues in each other and wanted to be supportive of them, since we could relate in several ways.  We would have arguments, but they typically revolved around his drinking.  Every time a major argument would come along, he would say he was going to work on quitting, go to AA, counseling, so on.  He seemed to have some anger management issues, which I had not realized I had as well until now.  I don't remember having issues arguing with others, except while I was a teenager and going through a very rough time.  

Eventually, we broke things off after one of these major fights.  He had lied about some serious stuff, and very hurtful things were said.  I tried dating other people, but I started having panic attacks and mood swings.  Eventually, I had a total nervous breakdown, basically homebound and about to lose my job/school/etc. We would still communicate during this time. He was supportive, but we would continue arguing over things that were said and done.

Today, I have become that crazy ex.  Still texting, arguing, saying abusive things while crying and in terror of myself. I've admitted to him that I felt suicidal after some of the things that we went through.  But now I am sounding like an emotionally, verbally abusive person.  I know the easy thing to say is, 'go No Contact!' But, there are circumstances that make this difficult to do. 

I don't really know why I am posting about this.  I am not sure if I am seeking words of advice or encouragement.  I am seeing a therapist and psychiatrist.  Have been reading a lot about boundaries, and healing. I guess my real fear is I am this lonely, hateful, angry, and borderline abusive person that I am afraid of.

125,"I live in a small, shared 4-bed flat. It’s a fairly cheap place and we get a high turnover of young professionals, so no one really knows each other before moving in. 


Recently, a new guy moved in. I’ve not seen much of him as I’m barely in the flat except to sleep, but from our few short conversations he’s been perfectly nice. However, the girl in the room next to him has just shared a few things that have been making her uncomfortable.


She’s been hearing him having conversations and arguments with himself, both in his room and in communal areas. This has apparently included yelling to himself:
“Stop it”
“Shut the fuck up”
“Get out of my life”


I don’t want to be an armchair doctor but that seems like schizophrenia to me. 


I’m fully aware the first bit of advice will simply be to talk to the guy about it but the following make it a bit more complicated:


1. I’ve not yet noticed any of this myself, so wouldn’t really feel comfortable talking to him about it until I have.
2. The guy apparently angrily shouting to himself is concerning. I get that the vast majority of schizophrenics are not violent, but the unpredictability is unnerving and I’ve no idea how he’ll react if he hasn’t wanted to bring it up himself already.
3. I’m moving out soon, and don’t particularly want to cause any tension before I leave, as I won’t be the one dealing with it.


The girl in question is thinking of calling the landlord about it tomorrow. At first I told her that was a good idea, but now I’m not too sure.

Now while I can find this on wikipedia that it's used as a smoking cessation it does not state what mode of action is used to achieve this(negative allosteric modulators of nicotinic receptors however do not cause this suppression in me and wouldn't be an issue), the citation also doesn't provide any linkout or useful leads to where I might find this out.

This isn't a plea for advice (or maybe it is); this is more advice to anyone that this post resonates with. I won't be the only one like this.

I keep very few close friends. These couple people I can go to when I need support (which is rare). The majority of my relationships with people are one sided; the kind where friends will depend on me. I don't set out for them to be like this they just end up being like this. Deep and meaningful from one perspective but superficial from another because I find it hard to share and to entrust my worries or problems. I won't ask for anything or need anything in return but they will see me as a source of support or guidance. 

I spread myself thin, trying to support as many friends / family as possible which leaves me burnt out, worn out, often neglecting my responsibilities in my own life. More than that I have neglected my physical and mental health as the burden leaves me constantly laden with worry, unable to do things like go to the gym and to eat properly. I find it hard to allow people to get to know me as it will show them my weaknesses; as a result I dip in and out of people's lives to allow myself to focus on my own life and immediate family and to just recuperate.

The end result of trying to be Mr Reliable, I become  to unreliable. People won't remember what you have done for them in the past, they will remember whether you were there or not recently when they needed you most. Was your phone on when they needed to speak? Had they heard from you in weeks when they needed you?

Some advice:

This approach to life is at it's bare bones selfish and has lost me lots of friends who I love and leaves people thinking that I see them as acquaintances and don't care about them.

I have found that when you spread yourself this thin, it is hard to give anyone the attention that they need and deserve

I've had a turbulent lonely life, dropped out after 1 year of college, in a few years I will be past my prime, and working in poverty drowning in debt while resenting my sexuality doesn't make me want to get out of bed and work towards that future. Existing isn't living. I can't see myself being happy and Out.

Idk if this is just me talking to myself or if anyone can help.
Tl;dr I'm at rock bottom mentally financially spiritually familially socially and other than a miracle soulmate or non sexual sugar daddy I can't see any light down the tunnel. ",22Feb2019,2
133,"A few weeks back a co-worker was in a bad mood, treated me very passive aggressively and sent me in for a loop. The behaviour went well past the border of bullying and although it is sorted now, the negative thoughts in my mind have been uncontrollable ever since. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've fallen into a depression. It feels like I'm watching myself from afar. I recently saw a car but pulled out in front of it anyway. At the time it felt like I had no control over what I was doing and I'm feeling like this 24/7. I'm fighting to be present so much that migraines are a commodity, and the worst part is that I'm doing well otherwise. Regularing the gym, diet, clean room, all the things that set me into depression in the past are accounted for but socially and internally I'm a wreck. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to work on my social side next week so that these types of social difficulties don't trigger my depression in the future but I'm at a loss for how to get out of it right now.

134,"I am new at this sort of thing and mind not that I’m doing this from my iPhone. That being said today I had an epiphany, about depression and how life consuming it can be. Some of my back story consist of being in recovery from IV drug use and alcoholism. I used those as horrible coping skills for the traumas that I’ve experienced in my life. I’ve attempted Suicide 3 times and I’ve flatlined once during my fight with heroin and IV drug use. Depression was the catalyst behind these drug filled tendencies and I want to express that there is hope beyond these walls that seem to always be closing in ourselves, six months ago I was at the bottom of my proverbial rock I tried to kill myself in a half assed manner of taking sleeping pills if anything in hindsight it seemed more of a cry for help after life went down the shitter from my perpetual drunk fueled benders. I won’t make any excuses while having the wisdom to know and how to do the right thing I was cosmically shitting the bed over and over again. Six months ago I joined a Christ based program that helps people in their addictions and mental health struggles a chance to take ten months away from life and focus on rebuilding themselves. It’s far from perfect but the daily inspiration I get from these fellow survivors is down right humbling. Before we move forward I’m not going to make this all about god Jesus Christ and religion I don’t want any one to feel pressured as this is meant to be an article that gives hope to the hopeless. Mental health is such a cunning thing it’s so beyond fascinating for me as a man who suffers from my fair share of issues. It’s what I want to ultimately do with my life is work with people who are in a horribly dark place in their lives. Giving hope is what I feel I was put on this planet for. I look at people who have been through trauma and you see the hopelessness in their eyes. To me depression is what puts people into this box that over time and when given the negative attention an energy continually closes in on you and cause outburst of anxiety anger sadness and rage. It kills me when I see people so lost in the traumas that have consumed and driven them down a deep dark road with life that they overdose, get institutionalized be it prison jail psych wards or worst of Suicide. In the six months I’ve been in this program I’ve made peace with all of my past traumas and now can focus on sculpting a life that’s built to help grow with the people close to me and make a difference in the disenfranchised. I want to give you hope if you’re struggling and you feel like no one understands you what your struggles are there is nothing to put there or crippling for you soul. There is so much hope that I want to share, I am here to build the brokenness that resides in so many of us hope does exist and I wanna share mine with the world. If you’re reading this and are struggling with the cards that life has dealt you feel free to comment and I’ll gladly share my story with you and do what ever I can to help you.  ",22Feb2019,5

136,"TL:DR when I was young I had pretty strange rage problems, now they disappeared ( I hope ) and was wondering if it's normal or can be something more serious. ( Pls read the full post )

So... As a kid, I was really calm and peaceful, but, as my parents says, sometimes I had some rage problems... The first strange thing that they noticed was that when I was doing something, and suddenly this thing didn't went the way I wanted it to go, I would just go mad and destroy everything. They said that one time I was building a lego and it fell off my hands, after this I started to scream, destroyed the Lego more and ehm... Started to hit the wall with my head ahaha...
Flash forward at the last year of kindergarten. A random kid, who liked to bully other kids just slapped me random. I just went full mad, and punched him in the nose, after this he started to bleed and I felt really good, but after 30 seconds I was so worried and felt sooo bad... I'm a really kind, calm and kinda introverted Pearson, so this shocked me... I remember that I gifted him some of my toys to say sorry. Falsh forward to the first year of school. At this point the true rage problems went full out. There were 2 factions in my class, the classic ""nerdy"" and good guys vs the sports kids. The sport kids insulted us just to have some fun until in one moment i kinda heard myself thinking "" what did I do to get all of this ? "". After this I went full rampage, I felt a rage and a hate coming up from deep inside my body. When the hate emerged, I was out thinking about beating and killing those guys, my face looked like a mad dog, I showed the teeths in an aggressive way and started to growl, and I cryed too. All my friends jumped on me to calm me down. The rage was too strong, I couldn't resist, I needed a way to calm down, so I broke all my pencils :/ and finally calmed down... After this I felt really bad and strated to cry again. After this show the other kids kinda bullied me more just to lit me and then run away, like a game lol. I needed nothing to get mad. Just 2/3 bad words, maybe a little punch... So, I knew this was bad, but couldn't stop going berserk after some offenses. After some time the other kid stopped bothering me and actually became my friends ( they were not bad, just had fun making me mad lol ) after those events I didn't had this problems anymore. Sometimes I still feel this internal anger but I resist ( until today only for min things). I think that sport helped me a lot. But I'm afraid that if something goes wrong, maybe someone hits me at night or this kind of things I could go berserk again, and I'm scared because now it's not like when we were kids, now things can go really wrong. I'm calm and kind, I don't want to hurt other people, I just have this demon inside... 
So, after all of this, is it ""Normal"" or It could be that I have some major mental health problem like some kind of psychosis ? Any thoughts?

137,"Im a very stoic, skeptical,  and pattern oriented individual. I had a turbulent childhood and as a result of an autistic mother,  developed reactive attachment disorder. Its led to me distancing myself from emotions/emotional decision making as best as a human can, as a self defense mechanism. Heck, no joke, I loved star trek as a child and my favorite characters were Spock, Odo and Data, the most emotionless characters in their respective crews. I even dressed up as spock two years in a row for halloween in primary school. Im often unfortunately self away, and I tend to just quietly detach and just observe most social situations.  As a result Ive struggled to form social bonds with most people as im seen as a stick in the mud or even worse, threatening. I have a very intimidating presence to many people, but i cant help but be who i am. 

The situation is made worse by my other eccentricities. Out of experience and necessity, I dont see the world the same as the  majority and have a hard time relating to them. I dont care about material posessions, status, sports, or gossip in the way that many do. I think  excessive shopping is just a symptom of low  self satisfaction.   Im not  generally drawn to arbitrary notions of what a ""good"" life is and dont subscribe to any idea of an ""american dream"". But because I tend to keep to myself, and require strict routines to function ( as a result of ADHD) people often disregard me or look down on me. Which is ironic because im generalizing other people, which is the very thing im protesting. I struggle alot with feeling inferior one minute, and knowing in some sense Im miles ahead of my peers. Being human is messy and obnoxious
