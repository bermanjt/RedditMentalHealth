i wanted to share something I did, trying to show how it could be/feel to have a depersonalization “re order of things”
please share it, if you think it’s relevant and could help someone’s day a little bit better! 

https://youtu.be/j6B2c56PrEY

the little write up I did for it:

Since a was a child, I’ve felt disconnected from reality in a lot of different ways. I couldn’t understand social interactions, especially when talking to more than 1 person, I never felt connected with some sort of group or “whole”, I had to jump from one thing to another never linking the two of them. I had a life changing experience when I was about 16, this fear and sense of distance began to increase to the point where I was no longer myself, but a thing looking from far behind my eyes, where reality looked like a small box enclosed by a vast black nothingness. My sense of touch and bodily sensations were clogged and jammed together in some sort of sensatory highway. Where sometimes I didn’t feel a single thing, but then all the sudden everything came streaming together in a single capsule. I had some sort of panic attacks when playing music and guitar, as what would happen is that I would be playing something and then stopped feeling, but I could still see my self and hear my self-playing, after a couple of seconds, I would feel all the notes that I played and all the movements in a single burst. It hurt. Like if it was trying to catch up with time by arriving faster and harder, I could feel every single digit hammering. I felt dizzy, my hearth about to explode.
  I learned quite a lot from this and worked to transform it into a useful skill. 
I also learned not to assume what people’s reality is like, you wont ever know, as close as you might get to know someone, you can only imagine.   

For those moments of loneliness, lucidness and euphoric depression, I made this piece.    Share this and take some time to notice others, feel connected, grateful.   

If you made it this far, thanks for your time!",15Nov2019,1
1,"I overthink everything, I second guess myself, I punish myself, I worry too much, I ruin everything for myself.

Let me give an example: 
""On simple things, like buying a video game, I ruin everything. Should I buy it? Should I not? should I get it on my computer? Playstation? Okay, I'll get it on PS4, decided, good to go. two minutes later: But how about PC? Should I get it there? should I wait? etc etc...""

You can see how I tend to ruin stuff for myself, I'm so over it, i'm going crazy, I can never make a decision, in small things and big things...I need help man.",15Nov2019,1
2,"I don’t know where to go from here.

Hi. This is a throwaway account.

My husband of over a decade recently had an emotional affair. He lied to me for over a year about multiple things but also throughout the duration of our marriage together. 

I’m still young. We got married fresh out of hs, and had kids right away. Due to a lot of unfortunate circumstances, we never had family support. This led me to have to stay home to watch the kids while husband worked.

Many years of one car, husband working swing, and no family or “village”, I am extremely depressed. Majority of my says are spent in the house, unable to leave and no one to talk to. Not my mom, my dad, my grandma passed away etc. 
my world revolved around him.

I have anxiety. I’m obviously depressed. 
Well after finding out about his infidelity, I feel myself falling more and more into despair. I don’t see the point in anything anymore. Things that I previously enjoyed, I don’t. I don’t want to do absolutely anything at all. In fact, I’ve daydreamed about running away almost every single day and I finally understand why people want to commit suicide, although that’s not what I want to do.

In fact, I don’t know what to do. At all. I feel stuck. Suffocated. I feel like I cannot move one way or another. 

Money is tight. If I work a part time job, I will have to pay for childcare which would negate anything I would make from my job. 

I just simply do not know what to do. I just want to lay in bed and sleep all day or stare at the ceiling. How do I get around this? How do I get past this? What do I do?

Just reaching out. 
Not sure where to go from here but something needs to change.",15Nov2019,1

I'm not being racially profiled (to a serious degree) nor am i discriminated against to a major level. I don't have to explain my sexuality to anybody or have to defend myself against haters. What can I complain about? Why do I feel like shit under the boot? I keep remembering a line from the Dubliners:

6,"Honestly I’ve been up and down for almost 6 years.. I have been diagnosed with BPD, ADHD and sever anxiety
I’ve lost so many people and I’ve tried so hard and only now am I coming past things that once grieved me for so long.. 

I was 14 when I lost a good friend to a drug induced suicide. 
I had a friend that was dating him at the time (I’m the reason they met), they were wildly in love and yeah it was gross but cute. Every weekend we would sneak out of the house and catch a bus to his house where we would steal watermelons from Woolworths across the road. 
I remember on my 15th birthday, he held my hand and cried.

“I don’t know how to keep living.” 

That’s what you said.. and then three months later you were dead. 
I attended your funeral, said goodbye and that was it.

By the end of that year I had nothing left in me. My friend was so distraught about losing him that she was ushered in and out of hospital for months for ODing, cutting and attempted suicide. I was in therapy and I was working so hard to fight this darkness before it overtook me and I lived in the dark for ALMOST 6 YEARS. 
I was cutting, I was doing drugs, I was going into the city, blind drunk and talking to anyone that would listen. 
I was failing school completely, losing jobs, struggling with money and eventually it all led to the day that I attempted to take my own life. 

It would be 11 MONTHS since then.

What stopped me?

My cat meowed at my door.

I am now 19 years old and soon to be 20
I haven’t cut since last year, I’ve got a girlfriend and I’m finally comfortable in my skin.
I still struggle here and there but my cat still meows at my door each night since then to check on me..",15Nov2019,1

im at my grandmas place
everything looks really old and run down

i tried forgetting about that

11,"Greetings, 

I have issues that I feel I don't have the vocabulary to talk about succinctly.  Hence I'm asking if there is some formal name for what I've experienced.  ""Backseat driver effect"" is the best name I could come up with.  ""Boss looking over your shoulder effect"" would also be appropriate.  

In a nutshell, the problem I have is that I make significantly more mistakes when I'm being scrutinized by someone who doubts my ability to complete a task than I would if I were attempting the task without an ""audience.""  For example; I've had a drivers' license for eleven years and never been in an accident, but my ex-girlfriend didn't believe I was a competent driver.  She would constantly make minor criticisms of my driving when we were together.  The funny thing is, when this was happening, I would make way more mistakes, such as getting lost or missing a turn in an area I was very familiar with.  This in turn justified her doubts about my competence, leading to more scrutiny and more criticism from her, which then led to more mistakes on my part, and so it spiralled.

I've had issues like this at work as well.  The issue is not that there are controlling/overly-critical people out there, the issue is that I seem to have a way of giving them justification to be the way they are.  Get micromanaged by my boss, make really dumb/rookie mistakes, boss thinks I'm an idiot and looks over my shoulder/micro-manages more than before, even bigger mistakes from me, etc.  

Is this a symptom of something or is there a name for it other than what I have come up with?",15Nov2019,1
12,"Two of my friends have been seeing a monster like [this](https://imgur.com/a/Jkz0AQ1) in the corners of rooms... they both see a monster somewhat like that but with aspects of their own face on it, whispering or screaming at them. The monster can appear at any time, and often one of my friends is unable to move while the monster is there. Both have even described a burning sensation that the monster can cause you to feel if you don’t do what it wants. 

Has this happened to anyone else here? I’ve been looking online but can’t find anything, but I feel like it must be a documented psychological effect since both friends describe similar monsters. If you have experienced this, is there any way to cope with it?

FYI both friends struggle with their mental health in general, and have cut and had suicidal thoughts.",15Nov2019,1

19,"In December, I remember waking up, and feeling like there was a boulder on my chest, and I would stay in bed as long as I could before having to get up. And then I would be in bed early and do the same thing the next day.
I bought a motorcycle because it was dangerous and adrenaline inducing. I could nearly die every time I went out on it and to be honest I couldn't care less if I did or not. Every time I nearly did I smiled. Involuntary, what a thrill. 
When it was stolen I was heart broken. I didn't cry because I had to act proper and have my defensive barriers up I guess in the outward bound may week (a company leadership course) . That was the only reason why I wasn't as upset as I should have been.
One month later my bicycle was stolen and I haven't cried that much in my life. Last time I cited like that was when my grandparents died. I cried until they're were no more tears and I went to bed. 
Every conversation about either the bike or the cicycle is like a stab in the heart. The motorbike was the only thing that kept me content. The insurance company then took £1000 out of my bank account. I just laid over and let them fuck me. I had been thrown to the ground and kicked in the teeth and the last thing I was going to do was to stand up again. A month later I told someone about it in work and they convinced me to ring them to talk about it. Because the bike had not been recovered at this point they shouldn't have taken the rest of the insurance money. But because I had left it so late they could only refund me £660. I'll take that. 
The bike was recovered late August. All of the emotions came back again when I saw it. The recovery company had said that it was found upright on the road in a recent condition however when I got there.. It had to be scrapped. 
I have been getting high or drinking (or both) since at least May. I cant remember anything apart from that I did something since May. If I had the guts to kill myself I would have hanged myself in my house. 
I think it's a beautiful way to die. 
I have met some people this week and their positivity and attitude on actually caring has change my life. I have a problem and I need help.

I can't talk to anyone I'm sorry.",15Nov2019,1
20,"(US, Alabama) 

So in the last month or so things have really hit the fan at home and it's caused my mom to act differently. She thinks her husband is cheating on her since people have come to her shop to tell her and even spam called her on throwaway numbers. Some snooping was done too and she found more and more evidence of it happening. I think I would leave but me and my mom don't make enough to support ourselves anymore. I'm the only one next to my stepdad that makes a consistent paycheck. Now onto how she behaves now; she looses her phone and her keys all of the time and, what makes me concerned, she keeps 'loosing?' sleep aid. I don't know if sleep aid is addictive or not, but she goes through it like i do with barbacue chips, she also rambles sometimes about irrelevant things that no one even brought up. I usually ignore this stuff because we've never had a peaceful life, but I'm a little concerned about it. Does anyone have an answer?

I'm going through my own problems too but I don't know how to word it in a way I can make my family understand. I take medicine for ADD and no matter how much of a dose I take, I always end up feeling like shit on a specific time of day. I've taken it since 2013 when I was ten but since I started high school I've noticed my mood taking a turn. I feel mentally numb and pissy for no reason. I also get a bit of mood swings even when it's 'worn off' (I think it doesn't officially wear off until like a week has passed) and I can go 0-100 and back to 0 in an heartbeat. I told my mom this before but she said ""doc said that wasn't a side effect."" And when I tried to explain to her again, she flat out ignored me. Not to mention whever it doesn't sit well, I guess, and I get a really bad headache that I almost faint.  I went through a rebellious spell my freshman year where I didnt take it and I have nothing but good memories from that year even though I made horrible grades, I was having fun. Now I'm a junior whose doing good in school but I feel fucking horrible all of the time. I don't know what to do about it anymore, we can't really afford for me to go to a therapist and I don't know how much it'll cost to change out my medicine if it is the source of all of this.

Thank you for reading, I really appreciate it.",15Nov2019,1

23,"I lost my leg two years ago when I was in a really bad truck accident that wasn't my fault. When I was in the hospital I had over 100+ surgeries and I suffered a lot while I was there. When I was there I had a girlfriend I was dating for a few months but she broke up with me after it got too much for her to handle.

After I got out of the hospital I started talking to people on tinder and meeting them. I met this one girl who was really nice and didn't trust anyone to date for some reason. She had slept with 16 boys and never dated any of them. I was her first boyfriend when she was 22 years old and I took her around the world to different countries and spent time with her always. She was there for me on the anniversary of the day I got hit and we lived together during the summer and moved in together during college and lived together for the whole year. Our relationship started having problems when I felt inadequate because I was self conscious about all the guys she slept with. It wasn't her fault or anything that she did, but it made me feel like I wasn't special. She got upset and put words in my mouth and forced me into an open relationship where I could see other people.

I never saw any other girls physically but I hung out with more girls just to hangout. She said she was okay with it but eventually ended this open relationship in the spring, a few weeks before the anniversary of when I got hit. I was okay with ending it because I didn't want anyone else. She went to another state to attend a friend's graduation and spent the whole time talking about how she was happy that she had space and that she was having fun. It made me really sad. One of the girls I hung out a while ago with asked me to come over and hangout and I said sure because I was sad and crying the whole day. She then started kissing me and putting her hand on her breasts and she had sex with me and I didn't stop her. I broke up with my ex a few days later because of other issues that we had which included: lack of her paying for things necessary in the apartment, lack of her chipping in for groceries, she wasn't there for me on the anniversary of my loss, and lack of emotional attachment from her (she wasn't cuddling or kissing me anymore and never looked happy to see me). A few weeks later I tried texting her and she said I didn't show her I loved her enough and that she felt convenient because she helped me a lot with my disability (although I told her she didn't have to help me and I always apologized for asking her for help). I called her and we just talked about why it didn't work. I told her that I care about her and I wanted to be there for her but I also told her that I saw someone else and I felt awful about it. She got really mad at me and wanted to cut me off the phone call. She then proceeded to send me angry texts the text day attacking me and then put our text messages on twitter and her other friends began to attack me too through text. She then blocked me off everything. 

When I found out that my messages were on twitter my heart sunk and I couldn't feel anything after except anxiety, depression and sadness. I couldn't get turned on anymore by other people that wanted me. I felt sad and lonely all the time, especially since I lived alone in America and had no family. 

A few months pass and I send her an email on her school email apologizing. I told her I want to be stronger and be a better person every day. She replies back and tells me that she accepts my apology and tells me she is more confident and has gotten closer with her friends. A few days later she sends me a text and wants to meet up and talk to me. I break down crying and tell her i'm so sorry through text and that she was special to me and meant everything to me and that I didn't mean to hurt her and that I wish I was stronger. We then talked and ended up meeting up at her house without her parents.

When I get in to her house, I say ""hi"" and she hugs me and I hug her back and breakdown crying. I tell her ""i'm sorry"" and that I wish I could take back what I did and that I didn't mean to hurt her. I get up the stairs with her and I break down again and hug her and cry even more. She then tells me that she feels nothing when she sees me. She says that I am disgusting and that I made her feel disgusted. I reiterate the problems I had with the relationship and that I'm sorry I let her down. I tell her that I tried to cope with her seeing other people and that its not her problem it was mine. I do tell her that I think we should be there for each other and get help together. I tell her, ""If I can lose a leg and learn to walk again, then why can't we help each other?"" She then tells me it would be too hard and I tell her that losing a leg and being in the hospital and operated on constantly was hard but I did it, so why can't we get help together?

I tell her that I wanted to travel more with her and spend more time with her. I told her that i'm sorry for hurting her and that I wish I didn't. I tell her that I am struggling with mental health and that I stopped taking my medications and medical marijuana (I use for pain and anxiety but it makes me anxious and paranoid now). She tells me she doesn't trust me and that she feels nothing, and that she is also depressed and doesn't do anything with anyone anymore or go to class. I tell her that I want to be there for her and with her and to take care of her like she did for me. She says she will never feel the same and that she feels a love for me but its not the same anymore. She says maybe we can be friends but it won't necessarily lead to a relationship. I told her that I would try that but I don't know if I can because I would get jealous if she was with other people. I saw other people this summer but I stopped because I missed her and wanted her back. I tell her i'm not seeing anyone right now or talking to anyone. I then tell her there's no point of me being there if she doesn't have feelings for me anymore and that its too painful to see her. I walk out of the house with my dog and tell her that I have no purpose in life.

I text her the two days after telling her that although she doesn't trust me I won't abandon her and that if she ever needs me to feel free to text me. I tell her no reply is necessary so she doesn't reply back. I text her on Tuesday telling her that I want to meet again and be more positive and talk about positive things. I tell her that I want to earn her trust and work together and be happy. She tells me that she doesn't want to and that she never wants a relationship with me ever again and that she doesn't trust me. She continued and told me that she has been seeing other people. I reply and tell her that I saw other people and felt nothing, then I tell her goodbye again.

I literally cannot stop thinking about this again. This whole series of events brings me so much pain. I have to take anxiety medication including prozac and xanax from my PCM but I still feel depressed and sad. Other girls don't interest me I just think of her all the time. I feel so lonely in America. Nobody here cares about me and I feel abandoned. I talk to my parents often about it but its difficult. I'm trying to find a therapist but its taking a lot of time to do so and nobody has gotten back to me yet.",15Nov2019,1

25,"So I’ve been having trouble with this for awhile, and it’s really starting to get to me. I’m just wondering what it’s is and I’m more worried about how these will hurt me in the long run. 

So the first problem I’ve been having is with sleeping. When I close my eyes, I get these pictures of horrific things, like scary images or disgusting faces. I’ve been told about hypnagogia, and I’m not sure if that’s the case. These images flash at me, and they’re vivid, they’re not just making a picture of the shapes I see when I close my eyes. These are like vivid images with blue and red and clowns and beheaded humans. (From what I read it doesn’t really sound like hypnagogia but please let me know what you think).

Another problem I have been having is when I’m trying to fall asleep (I have insomnia) I see these shadows on my walls sometimes. They’re fuzzy and sometimes they’re made out of objects but sometimes I will look up at the ceiling and find something hovering over me. I’m not sure what it is and it has different colors, and I can’t move because I’m too panicked and I’m scared if I shift it will hurt me. Sometimes in public I will see a silhouette that is not there but it is only for a quick second.

The next problem I have is with voices. Sometimes I hear noises and people saying my name, and I’ll ask the person next to me if they heard that too — but they’ll just say no, I have no idea what you’re talking about. It happens very rarely, though. It first started when I was very young and my mother was trying to get me to sleep, and I heard someone say my name. I asked my mom if she heard it too and she said that sometimes people hear voices when they’re sleepy (now that I look back, I feel like she was just telling me that to go to sleep, but I would like to know if anyone knows anything about this).

The last problem I have is a kinda of flashback thing. When someone mentions a situation or event that has upset me, like an embarrassing moment or dangerous situation, I see these images in my head of the event and what might have happened if things had gone differently. I try to clear my head but I just panic and I can’t control it. For example, while snorkeling, I almost died when a wave threw me upon the rocks (it would’ve hit my head and I could’ve died if my dad hadn’t moved me in time), so I keep seeing what might’ve happened if my dad hadn’t moved me. It’s hard now for me to write about this because I see it in my head and my hands are shaking. I also get this when people mention self harm because of my past experiences.

Thanks for reading this. Please let me know what you think. It’s very difficult to deal with this. I don’t want to self-diagnose and i want other people’s opinions, because I don’t know if this is what happens with normal people.
If this makes any difference I have had anxiety problems in the past, I have been diagnosed by a doctor but I have never gotten the courage or time to get help. 

Thanks again.",15Nov2019,1
26,"Pretty much exactly what the title says. I just,,, really don't want to sleep. I stayed up about 65 hours early this week out of necessity, and idk how to explain it other than saying it was kind of cathartic. I've had two nights of sleep since then, but I've found I just don't want to sleep anymore. It doesn't hold the appeal that it used to have. I used to take any advantage I had to sleep, but now all I want to do is push my body to the limits and see how late I can stay up. I know it'd be a bad idea but the desire is really strong, and I'm laying down in my bed right now, and I don't know if I'll be able to bring myself to sleep tonight.

28,"Dear reddit, this is a bit of an odd request as I’m not actually the person suffering here. You see, I recently moved out of my parents home and into the great abyss of life. However I came with two of my friends who we all now share a house together. The thing is, my life is going rather well, getting good grades in school, feeling ok and generally being happy. However my friends in the other hand are the complete opposite.

On the one hand, one of them is having a hard time coping with loss and family troubles as well as trauma from the past while the other feels stuck in place and feels like they will end up a failure. I don’t want to go into much detail but they are both suffering a lot and I don’t know what to do but listen. I can’t even relate to their problems. So I need some help on what to do besides just sitting and listening to them rant on about their depression. I want to help, but I have no idea how.",15Nov2019,1

I had a visit to the ER because of a severe panic attack. I am at a loss for what to do. I have an appointment with a psychiatrist in 2 weeks but I don't think I can wait that long.

Hi guys, tomorrow is my first therapy session. Im feeling really nervous and I'm not even sure where I should begin. Some things have happened that make me suspect I might have some PTSD or something similar, and I've read about narrative exposure therapy as a common way to treat it and I am absolutely terrified of the idea. Ive never spoken about the incident and I have memory loss surrounding the issue and the idea of talking about it seems physically impossible. I've also been experiencing other problems that I don't believe are related to the above, like crying multiple times daily and suicide ideation (I dont have a method or any intention of going through, just fantasies)and sometimes I hyperventilate on my drive to school and I have to turn around and go home. Anxiety and depression both run in my family and I suspect that might also be the case for me, but I'm really worried that this is going to be immediately dismissed as PTSD. I was wanting to ask the therapist their opinion about me getting a federal to talk to someone about medication for these issues, but I dont know if that's appropriate for a first meeting or if that will make me look like I just want drugs. Im really nervous about this first meeting and I dont feel like I know what I should or can share. I was wondering if anyone had advice that has done therapy before",15Nov2019,1
34,"Sometimes, it takes a crisis for people to take action. My family just found out from a school counselor that my only sibling, my 12-year-old sister (I'm 24), tried to self-harm and failed. We sprang into action as soon as we found out, but it was a blow that came out of the blue and suddenly brought clarity to our lives. Mental illness is a shameful subject in my family and it's something we're finally forced to confront face to face. 

This past week, I've had difficult conversations with both of my parents (I currently live at home since I'm between undergrad and grad school), asking them to acknowledge some behaviors that are really harmful. Granted, I know very well that it's impossible to change other people, only ourselves, but I still find it hard not to say those things. I just had a consultation meeting for therapy today, and last month I experienced a complete emotional breakdown that ended in me leaving my job and taking a vacation in the mountains. I came back with a mission to finally be active in making change happen, and so far I have kept that promise to myself.

I want to keep this short just to demonstrate a point. I think that things had to go this way. All of this family's shit is about to hit the fan simultaneously and I'm kind of ready for it. I'm ready to experience the reality of what we're facing and to finally effing do something about it.

He asked if he could apologize. I basically said no for the moment and I don’t want to talk to him for awhile.

I don’t know if I have a mental condition or not. I have trouble speaking most of the time, even with close friends or with family.

Sometimes I also have trouble reading, for example I might read something without understanding and have to read it several times more before I get it. I also have difficulty saying things through writing except it’s a little easier than speaking.

I keep getting these triggers from classmates on senior paper projects and this one professor that makes me cry in nearly every class plus planning a wedding and working and trying bot to fail and being away from home, its all just so much. 

So things set me off and i just find in my room (men cant enter the women’s dorms and vice versa ((i know its stupid but it’s a Christian campus))) i avoid him sometimes because fiancé can be very very touchy and lovey and on my good days thats great. But i don’t like physical touch 90% of the time, with him its more like 75%, but on my bad days it just adds to my anxiety. Cause i feel like everyone is watching us and he kissed me and held my hand or put his arm around my waist and like i said we are on a Christian campus so you do get a couple looks. But my anxiety makes everything so loud and big and hard. 

Like today i spent all afternoon and evening crying in my room because i feel lost and abandoned and like he doesn’t want to be with because I’m like this and when I’m like this (on my bad bad days) i isolate and hide and cry. 

When i try to explain it he ask questions to understand, to learn how to help and make things better for both of us but i just shut down.

49,"This is more of just...venting then anything else.  For context, I'm 36 now.  Things are going better in my life, but they're entirely related to me taking action with my mental health.  Almost 2 years ago now, I checked in with my doctor being I was, bluntly, suicidally depressed.  I'd recently gotten a new job I really enjoyed, and things were going well in my personal life, but there was that constant nagging sensation of how much better it would be to be dead.  I literally described it as a pit in my stomach that never went away.  My doctor very kindly talked to me about being evaluated for clinical depression.   This ended up being the beginning of  personally addressing my own issues, and getting on a combination of medication and therapy that really helped.  

Why I'm posting this is, I'm realizing how hard it's become to maintain a relationship with my family.  My mental health issues were pretty out in the open when I was younger.  I self abused, I was terrible in school.  Flunked out of college when I basically stopped showing up because I couldn't get out of bed in the morning or staying awake for days on end.  I couldnt keep relationships and would resort to going into the backyard to punch trees when I was upset because I couldn't process how I was feeling in any other way.  Parents caught me cutting once and threatened to ""send me to a hospital"" but never actually did anything other than glare at me if people asked about my scars.  

Also, I'm aware my parents are from a different generation.   They're both in their 60's, and just didn't talk about mental health.  Even so it's hard to not feel like at a certain point I wasn't just tossed aside and labelled a screw up.  Now it makes me upset because various family will come out of the woodwork to tell me I how they can see ""such a good change!"" or how, despite struggling when I was younger ""you're doing so well now!""  Yeah, and that took a lot of medication to get there.  I don't even really like them, or like being around them anymore.  My mom included, which is painful to even write.  I don't even know if it's worth bringing up to them at this point, since I don't see adressing it having a happy conclusion.

I feel like I'm dreaming. I feel like I'm watching my body do routine things like eat and sleep and go to work, but I'm not in control. I'm typing this message out, but it still doesnt.. \*feel\* like I'm doing it. I feel like that part in Get Out where the guy is in the Sunken Place, or as if I'm sitting back in a theater watching life happen through m eyes but its on the movie screen. I'm present and aware but not in control.   


I have zero emotions. I can't remember things that make me feel any sort of way, I can't do anything and enjoy it now. Time feels like it's flying by and going very slow at the same time. I drove to work and didn't remember driving here because it was so fast. I laid on the couch with my dog for 3 hours and I thought it was only maybe an hour. In the moment though it feels as if everything is going very slow. As of this point in the message it is 1:20 AM, just so I can keep track of how long this takes me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I said before that it feels as if I'm dreaming. I feel like I'm floating and that nothing is real anymore. I'm actually terrified that I'm going insane. I was working, and something popped up on my computer screen and it was so out of the ordinary that I was terrified that I was hallucinating. This has happened a couple times since this started and when I would go to look at it, it would have changed back to the way it was supposed to be. This is always in the form of text, so almost what I would think of as dyslexia. Anyways, in this instance, the text read,""Operational checks goooooooooooooood"" and it should have just read ""good"". It scared me so badly that I stared at the table and asked my friend to look at my screen and tell me what it said. He laughed when he got to that part and told me that it was funny, and I looked up and it was still that way.   


Because everything feels like a dream, my mind tells me that I can predict things before they happen. Nothing too crazy, but small inconveniences. Like, I can tell when I'm going to catch a pokemon in pokemon go or if it will break out of the ball, or if it will flee. Little things. I also know what people will respond with before they respond to something that I said. I think that it's like the  explanation for Deja Vu where your brain gets the wires crossed and then thinks that the event that you saw happened before you saw it so that, in some way, you've re-experienced the thing that just happened.   


The craziest part of all of this is that I know that I'm okay. I know that I'm not in a dream, and that it's just my brain but I can't break out of it. This used to happen in highschool like once a year and it would last for maybe a week up to maybe a month and then one day I would realize that I feel fine again.

63,"I was sexually abused as a child. I have PTSD, OCD and I think probably Bipolar but that hasn’t been diagnosed. 

My mother and I rented a place together. We needed somewhere closer to the city, and the city is very expensive, so together worked. 

We were asked to house sit for a friend in a nice property. I had a panic attack one night. She locked me in the house, called the ambulance. They arrived and told her they had no right to take me away as I was a competent adult, rational, not suicidal. 

She didn’t like that and stormed out. She left me with one pair of clothes, no food, didn’t check I had access to money. I was also very physically ill at the time and she was aware. 

She refused to answer my calls for a week. Wouldn’t speak to me. I had to walk all around the town looking after myself despite having feet the size of bricks because of this physical thing. 

She agreed to meet me the morning we had to leave the house sit. She didn’t show up and then antagonised me on the phone when I called to enquire where she was. 

I then took what things I had and walked the ten kilometres to the middle of the city. I was now homeless as she had taken my key to our hour apartment. 

A friend put me up in a hotel for two nights. My mother still wouldn’t allow calls. 

After those two nights, I slept on the street one night. Then another friend offered to pay for a hostel for two weeks. 

It’s now been a month. My mother still won’t accept calls except once every while. 

She has tried to force me into inpatient by saying she wouldn’t contact me or allow a place to live unless I did so. I’m already enrolled in an outpatient program which has been deemed acceptable for my needs, and have been told inpatient is inappropriate. 

She closed the lease on our place, meaning I now have nowhere to live that is remotely conducive to me being able to work and study. 

She now keeps insisting I get a studio somewhere (despite barely earning a living) and cope, even though it’s been suggested by several therapists that it’s best I live with a loved one while I recover and gain confidence in my abilities (I struggle with some tasks). 

I have suggested we get another rental together, and have assured her I will attend the program I am enrolled in, will go to work, will continue studying, will gradually increase my responsibilities each week and build confidence. She won’t even entertain the thought, apparently, until this new program starts which is next year. 

So she is essentially telling me to be homeless until 2020, and then we can talk about it. 

I don’t have enough money to live independently at the moment. I’m barely coping as I am, trying to work and study while being ill. I cannot wait any more (it’s been months now) not knowing where my place of residence is and having no stable home. It’s making me feel very very bleak and I’ve started having really severe panic attacks.

Everything I was, every minute detail, every tick to every obsession all is yesteryear. A distant memory too faded to put down into a memoir. This is not me.. I am parts of everything that is you. Everything that makes you, every bit and every piece conjoined and moulded together now makes me. The happiness you see in me is certainly not mine but it is far from fraudulent. Lack of self worth had my mind latching onto every moment I found any amount of validation of joy in you for the numerous attempts I'd made to achieve that. I deceived my mind into believing the tiresome tasks were of my interest; tasks that bring me joy. You could call it conditioning or what have you. Truth is, it's not the task but the reward of your happiness. Things that make you happy do not make me happy. It's your gratification your contentment and your satisfaction with me that does. I can't convince myself of this. I want to believe I've changed. But when I am left wondering what sparks my interest, I think of you. I surrendered a long time ago. I've become the spouse you wanted me to be. This is not who you fell in love with and it crushes me to the core seeing you love someone that holds no remnants of me. I wait for you to tell me you miss me. I ache for you to remind me of things that excited me, that maybe I've forgotten but you remember. I dreamt of a life where you and I were relentlessly loudly freely ourselves; celebrating ourselves together. Why does it feel like you had to dim me down, strip me of everything I was until you could rebuild me with pieces of everything you wanted.",15Nov2019,1

66,"Mental illnesses are real and they can be debilitating. If you feel like you’re struggling it’s valid but pretending to be “so depressed” just to fit in is really damaging to people who are really struggling because when they do open up it’s rarely taken seriously before it’s too late. This causes self destructive behaviours in order to self validate what you’re feeling seeing as no one takes it seriously. It’s okay to be sad, it’s okay to be nervous, it’s okay to feel overly hyper and not have a mental illness what you’re feeling is valid in its own right so don’t take away the validity of those who have mental illnesses.

68,"I don’t know why I’m posting on reddit about this. I feel so much pressure to not be “dramatic” or burden others with what’s going on. I don’t want to victimize myself. 
I’m a 19 year old female uni student. I look like a basic sorority girl. I feel so much pressure to look good, to fit a certain mold, make my family happy and succeed all the time. 

I’ve been asking myself, to what extent will I go? 

I’m pretty much living a double life. I don’t have that many friends, 2 girls back home at most that I would discuss things with. 

But never anything like this. 

I am cautious, but I have had sugar daddies since I was barely 18 (started a few months after I lost my virginity). To pay for my housing, books, etc. We would have sex. I can never do it without alcohol, though. And I never cared, or it never bothered me until the past month (im clean, never had an std thank god). And the only people who are interested in being my friend are guys on tindr or my social media.  This next thing I can’t talk about this with anyone. Or I’m not ready to. 
I feel very confused by it but haven’t thought about it much. 

I’ve also had a couple grey areas with rape (2 separate times w my guys age.) The first was less grey, it happened in my moms car. I’m just afraid of admitting it to myself because I don’t know what that means. 

One was two weeks ago. I’m just not sure, and I think I seemed really consensual but I didn’t know we had sex until the next day when I texted and asked him what happened because I had bruises on me. I still don’t remember much. But i do remember he asked me if I was okay after I fell and I said yes. Maybe I’m just being dramatic I don’t know.

I decided to visit my parents home this week (few hours away). My mom wants me to go back to my own home later today, I know I should. But I’m also afraid of myself. I’ve been having such deep thoughts and feelings lately, that are unlike me. This is my first time crying in years. But my mom just doesn’t understand or discuss emotions with me like that, she would tell me to get a better sleep schedule, stop mopping around. 

I feel like everything is just happening so fast. Ive been to a psychiatrist before and I don’t have any presenting mental illness. I’ve never had a history of self- harm or anything like that. And that’s why I’m so afraid. All of these emotions approached me so fast and intensely, I don’t know what to do with them. They won’t go away. I feel so much and also nothing at the same time.

70,"HOW DO I Stop being so shy and anxious around people and hating myself. I feel like I’m lacking a brain chemical or something. I just get stressed. I’m ok at conversation but I’ve been painfully shy and anxious nearly my whole life and I’m getting older now and I just want it to stop. I’m isolated. Currently I’m doing something I should be excited and happy about. Visiting one of my oldest (used to be closest as well but we don’t really talk at all) friends. I feel on the outside of all the stuff that’s happening and feel a ball of anxiety in my chest whenever I speak. How do I just relax? How do I stop being shy? I’m so sick of it. I’ve been seeing a therapist for nearly a year and I feel like I’ve made no improvement. I accept now that I’m an introvert but why can’t I contribute like everyone else. Why can’t I relax. Introvert isn’t synonymous for shy and anxious? I’m constantly comparing myself to others.  This should be a happy exciting trip but as i write this I feel like crying.  I’m not doing that badly but I wonder if I’ll ever get out of this rut of feeling so inhibited anxious and shy. I want to give up. Hundreds spent on therapy and I feel like sometimes I go backwards. I’m losing my sense of self again and if the rest of my life will be ups and downs like this I can’t do it. What’s wrong with me? I feel awkward doing everything...especially introducing myself. I feel left out and work and I don’t speak to many people, we work in a small team too. I even sometimes feel awkward around my family. I ditched superficial friends earlier on this year so I could finally start helping myself. Nearly a year later, they seem to be thriving and I seem to be in the same position.

71,"I have a serious problem with letting go of childhood. I was genuinely upset there was no playground equipment in high school when I started.   


When I got my first period at 13, I didn't know how to cope. I'd forget I had periods, and go through school days bleeding through my pants.   


It took me til I was 15 to stop wearing a big pink jumper with a Bratz logo on it. I was bullied for wearing it every single day, including days where the temperature got to 35+ degrees. Same goes for shoes, I wore one pair of shoes to school for two years until they literally fell apart. Not because my mum wasn't buying me new shoes, I just couldn't let go of these shoes in particular. I cried when they fell apart.   


For the entirety of my teen years, I had a whole make-shift Barbie/Bratz doll set up in a space between the living room wall and the couch. I begged for a Barbie Dreamhouse for Christmas one year. The big, pink 3 storey one. I got it and it was the best present I ever received. I literally played with dolls every day until my mum snapped and binned all of my doll things. All the furniture, dollhouses, dolls and clothes, everything got tossed one day when I was at school. I was devastated, and nearly 17.   


I slept in my mum's bed until I was 16 too, until she started locking her door at night to keep me out. I was so afraid of falling asleep at night that when she did lock her door, I'd completely break down and almost break the door down to get in because I was so afraid. I moved my mattress to the living room every night in hopes it'd help me sleep, but I'd ultimately be watching informertials til 4am every single night because I was so afraid of falling asleep. Looking back, I'm pretty sure this period of no sleep is what caused me to completely crash and burn academically. I wasn't doing great in the first place because I had undiagnosed ADHD and being female, I was just assumed to be depressed.  


When I started developing, I didn't know what to do. I wore the same A cup training bra for years, despite being measured as a DD. I wore the same clothes I did as a child until my dad (divorced parents and step-parent alienation) saw me for the first time in years and was concerned that my teenaged, developed self was still wearing the same clothes I wore before contact was cut when I was 10. He bought me $500 worth of clothes then and there. It was the first time I wore something remotely age-appropriate since being pre-pubescent. I was petrified of going into ""teenage"" stores, that I'd be laughed at for wanting clothes that fit me by strangers that didn't know or care.   


Then, practically overnight, I started wanting corsets and sexy lingerie and posted suggestive photos on social media. Nothing explicit, but certainly not appropriate for a 17 year old. I got in trouble at school because I took photos of myself in such attire for a photography class project. I started tying my school shirt up to expose my midriff and wearing tiny bike shorts to school that fit more like boyleg undies instead of school-appropriate shorts. I was far too socially awkward to interact with boys, and by then I was the ""weird girl"" people either avoided or made fun of, even in the friend group I kind of tagged along with. My only real, true friend through all this was my best friend who I've known since I was 5, but since she was really sporty and athletic we didn't hang out at school because of our different friend groups. So I was being hypersexual while not being sexually active at all.   


I don't know why I went from one extreme to the other.   
I feel weird typing this out. I don't understand why I was so afraid of growing up, of falling asleep at night, or why I suddenly did a 180. There was no in between. I don't know why about a lot of things. Typing this is making me cry.   


I still have LEGO and my day-to-day bag is a stuffed animal bag. I still have trouble ""growing up"". I can't even decorate my own apartment maturely, it's all bright colours and random, novelty knick knacks. I'm completely functional, I'm out on my own still working at my first ever job nearly 6 years later. I still struggle with change so much. All I want to do is hold on to right now that my life is passing me by. I'm 24 now and I still feel like a confused teenager with no direction in life. I hate it. I'm trying to find a free counselling/psychology service near me that doesn't have 6-month long waiting lists, but nothing so far. I'm sorry for the word vomit, idk where else to get this all out :(",15Nov2019,1

Did something change? Not really. It's normal life over here so there's no trigger I'm able to point out as a cause to the uptick in horrible feelings.

75,"After about two years of sitting in denial, I went down to my local clinic and got diagnosed with depression. They have yet to tell me what type it is but I've been booked in for future therapy sessions. I finally got the feeling of closure of discovering what was causing my sadness. I finished highschool having completed my last exam and I'm about to go on a trip with friends for a week. By all means I should be starting to feel better. 

But I'm not. It's only getting worse. 

I still can't feel happy. I went to a party and felt nothing but anxiousness and isolation. I'm grippled by this constant fear of being left alone for my entire life but at the same time whenever I'm around my friends I feel pressured to be ""better"". Make better jokes, have better looks, have a better mental state, and ultimately feel like they don't want me around. Like no one wants me around. 

I've started to drink whenever I feel down but it doesn't help either and now I'm constantly tired and I want to be happy so badly but I just can't. I feel like such a bratty person for saying this but I feel like after being so stressed and full of self hatred for so long I deserve at least a week where I can feel happy. That's all I want but I can't feel the joy of being carefree or just looking forward to tomorrow.

78,"I was diagnosed with ASD when I was a child. I am a 20 year old female with Asperger’s and have been detained for nearly a year. 

When I was a child, I had no issue with feeling anxious in social situations. I made people laugh a lot and I thought that was a good thing. I felt like people liked me until someone explained the different between being laughed with and laughed at. 

This caused me to feel insecure during my pre teen and teen years because I didn’t want to be the fool. The one everyone laughed at. I was so embarrassed and often stayed up late at night wondering if I had made any social mistakes throughout the day. I’d remember previous interactions and cringe because I knew I had somehow messed up. I hated myself for not fitting in. 

At 19, I was detained under the Mental Health Act and taken to hospital. This caused me to feel very distressed at first and I struggled with it a lot. I found it difficult to approach staff and ask for things, such as asking for the kitchen to be unlocked so I could get a drink, and I struggled to go into the dining room for food. 

After attempts to end my life in hospital, I was put on 1-to-1 observations which meant that I had to be watched by a member of staff at all time, including on the toilet. This made the distress worse at first but I eventually stopped caring. And once you stop caring about defecating in front of someone, you stop caring about asking for things or going to get food. You just stop caring about what people think. 

I realised how confident I had become in the second hospital I was sent to, when I had to go to an ICU ward. I was so used to not caring that I made a lot of progress there and recovered enough to go to a less secure facility. 

I am now writing this from a locked rehab, at the age of 20. I’m still detained but no longer on 1-to-1 observations and I’m trusted with my clothes and bedsheets in my room. I’ve come a long way from being watched 24/7 in an almost empty room and hopefully one day I’ll be released. 

I have very little to no social anxiety.

I'm fairly certain I have asperger syndrome. I've never gotten tested for it because if I do I'm extremely high functioning. I live with two behaviorists who work with autistic kids and they agree it's likely I have it. I'm also officially diagnosed with PTSD and anxiety, which I'm medicated for.   


So I've been doing this literally for as long as I can remember, since I was a kid. I have very odd sensory issues, and when I'm super anxious or stressed out the only thing that makes me feel better is darkness, privacy, and white noise. I've done this in different ways over the years, but currently with my living situation, when I'm stressed out I go into my bathroom, turn on the fan, turn on the shower, leave the lights off, and curl up on the floor to sleep with the hum of the fan and the shower (I don't pay for water here).   


I slept in here for a solid five hours yesterday because I'm so stressed about leaving a job recently. My rule is I can't think about anything relative to why I'm stressed, and I absolutely knock out to the darkness and white noise, and with how small and quiet the bathroom is. When I was a kid I opted to leave my nice bedroom and move into the basement with just a mattress because it was dark, private, and I could run the drier when I was stressed out and just fall asleep.   


It's the most comforting thing in the world to me. More than any consolation from anyone, or meditation, or exercise. Just falling asleep on the floor with white noise is the most relaxing thing ever to me.   


Anyone have any insight on this? It's not a problem, I'm more just curious.

Also sometimes a man will stand in the hallway of my room or in my room, and I used to see shadows of people moving in the trees at school
 Idk I'm just worried somethings wrong wrong upstairs if ya catch my drift. Its just I dont want anything to really be up, like i hope moving in with my bf in a year will help some stuff (hopedully the night terrors too) but I'm concerned something more serious is wrong",15Nov2019,1
90,"Please don't try to stop me. The best thing you can do to help me is to help me find a way to do this.

Previously, I planned to end things by next July if things don't get better by then, because my life shouldn't be a choice for my parents to make. Now I think I'm willing to move this schedule forward.

Any ideas on an easily accessible methods of suicide? Preferably low in level of pain, quick, and clean so afterwards there's less for whoever cleans up to clean up.

I live in the UK, don't have a GP or whatever they call doctors here. Over 18, don't really have access to chemicals. There might be a drugstore in town. No high rise buildings, tallest structure that I can access is likely only about 5 floors high.

I do live near a train track and I've checked the fences, I'm pretty sure I can climb over them. If I do that at night and lay on the track, I should be fine, but the trains are slow trains most of the time and it just seems like it would be extremely agonizing.

I’m exhausted all the time. I have two elem. age kids, shared custody with their dad, and even on my “free” days, I’m so tired I fall asleep by 8:30/9p. Part of this is stress-related. I feel lonely, unappreciated, undesired, etc. Been dating someone for 6+ months who works out of town, so we see each once weekly at best. My “friends” constantly flake on plans, so I stopped asking to do things with them bc it felt futile and disappointing. My mom is a narcissist who has emotionally abused me my entire life, certainly not someone I can share my problems with. Going to therapy hasn’t helped my mentality. Nothing helps.
 
I feel trapped in a monotonous, bleak, and hopeless existence. I feel alone almost constantly. I put on a happy face for my kids, my parents, and my friends, but I feel like my soul is dying. The only time I’m ever at peace is when I’m hiking in the woods with no one around and only the sound of the wind or the crunch of leaves beneath my feet. At the same time, I resent everyone I’ve called a friend for being so selfish and regularly excluding me from get-togethers, for regularly cancelling plans, for not responding to messages and for lacking proper etiquette. It makes me want to scream.
 
I’ve become filled with hatred and hopelessness because of these people who’ve nary shown any concern for my well-being. I constantly daydream about driving far away to a rural place with a small population. It seems odd to want to isolate myself when I already feel so alone, but I’ve never felt anything other than searing disappointment from the people I’ve had in my life.
 
No one cares. Everyone is selfish. Old friends or new, it doesn’t matter. They are all the same. Why don’t people care? Why am I always the last on everyone’s priority list when I’ve made sacrifices to show my love and loyalty to nearly every person in my life? It seems unfair and it sickens me, mentally and physically. There is literally no escape.",15Nov2019,1

93,"I'm tired. 

I can't do it anymore. I've been delaying going to a mental hospital for two weeks now and I feel like I'm going crazy. I have OCD but like ??? (I don't doubt having OCD I just think there could be more to it). 

Two years ago I had the worst time of my life and it has truly traumatized me. Can you get ptsd from mental illness? Like I get flashbacks of thoughts and emotions I felt back then and it's just so f\*ing maddening. I don't EVER want to go through this again. I would actually die. 

I'm taking medication, so I try and convince myself than now I'm actually treating my mental illness so I won't actually go that bad, but it doesn't work. 

I'm thinking about admitting myself into a psych ward for the time my meds kick in/ I get further assessment but I don't know how. How can I just go to my parents and just go like ""hey. I feel like dying."". That would break them.",15Nov2019,1
94,"Hi guys, I'm not sure if this is the right sub-reddit but here it is, if u don't want to read the whole thing, just read the first paragraph and the last thing:

I have a strong feeling that my sister has auditory hallucinations. They are very negative and verbally bully her. She said that they copy just the things from the outer world which are negative and bring her down, for example if I say to her you're dumb, these voices copy it and repeat it over and over again. She often speaks loudly to them, sometimes can't even sleep properly because the ""voices"" in her head are very loud and hence she's not really able to concentrate for example for school or homework due to lack of sleep and also these voices. Once in a while she has breakdowns because she couldn't hold her anger because of them. In the public, she sometimes listens to music whenever it gets really loud or so.

You must also know that before all of this, she had really bad eczema all over her body so that people like her classmates looked at her very strangely/disgustingly and so she was kind of an ousider. And also she lacked of sleep because of the eczema. But after some time, we found a good doctor and her eczema got less. Also she wears hearing-aid bc she can't clearly hear things without it.

According to her, it began last year in November. At first, it wasn't that intensive and I don't know the reason for the intensivity later on. But because of that, she really wanted to seek professional help and so, we went to the psychiatrist. She said that these voices appear or get intense idk depending on her level of fatigue. She didn't mention anything of auditory halluciantions. But my sister said to me that even if she's not stressed, she hears them and can't control/ignore them.

But we still trusted the psychotherapist and with the time, it didn't felt like she impoved very much, maybe just a little. One time, she needed to stay in the hospital because at that time, the voices intensed so much that she couldn't sleep very well for many days. So the doctor there diagnosed her with tinnitus which I can't relate. He also said that she must be aware that these voices are there.

Since then, it improved, but she still gets breakdowns maybe once a month. We're planning to ask a third opinion from a pschotherapist/psychologist.

So I myself did some research and I found out that it could really be aud. hall.. My question is, is it really this and if so, is it curable?",15Nov2019,1
95,"I’m 21, f, and I do have ocd but lately it’s been centered a lot on health obsessions and dying spontaneously whether from a health issue or not.

The last three nights has taken the worse toll on me. Tues evening I had really bad sleep paralysis and nightmares. Basically felt like I couldn’t breathe and move. 

Then Wednesday evening I kept having weird anxiety attacks. Everytime I was about to finally fall asleep, I’d wake up in a panic thinking or feeling like I’d stopped breathing. I don’t think I have sleep apnea tbh.

Then last night was the same issue. Everytime I was close to sleep, I’d have an intrusive thought that I couldn’t remember or I’d wake up freaking out thinking I’d stopped breathing or something was wrong

Idk what to do :(",15Nov2019,1
96,"Everyone in my life is proving my depression right that no one actually cares about me, and here’s a list to prove it:

- I told my parents over summer that my mental health is bad and that I’ve been seeking counselling. And yet, they never ask how I’m feeling or how my counselling is going and to be honest don’t show much interest in my life at all currently. 
- My flat mate of two years came to my room last night to basically tell me that I’ve been slipping in to old bad habits and it needs to stop because she has enough on her plate already, which then triggered a breakdown. 
- I told two best friends that I had a breakdown, and one responded and basically just invalidated my feelings. The other friend didn’t respond, and when I questioned her on it she said that my other friend responded so she didn’t need to.

And that’s it. They’re all the close people in my life that know about my mental health and none of them care. At least when I used to think these things I could blame it on my bad mental health and not it actually being true. I can’t even hold these people accountable because they’ll tell me it’s my bad mental health that makes me feel this way and that it’s not actually the truth (basically what my friend did today), and I’m gonna believe I‘ve gone crazy. I already feel crazy lol

And now I'm having the daily anxiety attacks again and I'm feeling very stuck. My fiance is very supportive of me and helps me take care of myself when I'm really in deep.
I just don't know what to do. I feel helpless and can't afford not to work but I can't deal with this constant feeling of doom everyday.
My health insurance wont go through until the first of the year so I don't have a doctor yet to truly talk to about this stuff with. So I'm reaching out here. Thank you all.",15Nov2019,1
99,"I don’t know where to turn to. I haven’t had any health insurance for the last few years so I finally went to the doctor yesterday for my mental health. He diagnosed me with Bipolar 2, and when he said that, suddenly everything made a lot of sense. The way my depression has cycled in and out for years.

I’m starting medication soon, and I’ll be seeing a psychiatrist, but until then I feel a little lost. I’m not really even sure what to say, other than I’m having a really hard time with the diagnosis alone. Instead of feeling better for knowing what’s wrong with me, I feel almost weighed down by the diagnosis. I’m not sure what to think or feel, but I know that’s normal with any kind of chronic or serious diagnosis.

Has anyone had a similar experience or feelings? Anyone here who’s struggled with their diagnosis itself? Like I said, it almost feels heavier knowing I have a disorder greater than just depression. It’s almost surreal, I guess.",15Nov2019,1
100,"So I’m in my 20’s going to mention a few things I think could maybe be related growing up I always lived with my mother , who is a very erratic and constantly panicking/scared and fearful state, always on edge, she’s the type of mom that yells thebtrouble away always yelling everyday since I could remember, not the best relationship a therapist described it as “verbal abuse and trauma” not my words there just to give a perspective there that’s really the only “trauma” if it even is that (I don’t like using it on myself feel like I haven’t had it that bad) besides some rather darker things involving death that I don’t see being involved.

This I just find very interesting, I’m rather well trained in combat sports (bjj Muay Thai ect) to the point I’ve been in physical situations training plenty I feel comfortable there I like it, and am confident I can handle myself if god forbid that situation ever happens.

But like I had to tell somebody I needed them to not do something recently just something very minor and it makes me like scared and edgy like a little kid that got caught stealing candy, even if two people around me start arguing I get all jittery and its like I instantly go full fight or flight, and it makes coming at someone with any little problem about them hard because I’ve never really been in a street fight outside of a gym but I feel like its always gonna escalate to that in my head I’m just waiting and it sucks because even if I just think somebody could come to me with a issue about myself even something that means nothing really or there not mad I instantly feel like the world is over",15Nov2019,1

I woke up exhausted, thinking about all the people I’d have to interact with today. I just couldn’t do it. So I took yet another sick day. 

Trying to convince myself it’s okay to be sick. Physically and mentally. Going to take the weekend and do as many things I can to enjoy it and go back on Monday ready to go.

105,"I've always believed that statistics are a powerful tool for gaining a better understanding of any issue, including mental health issues. Here's some that I found, and cited.

1.  17.3 Million Americans, or 7.3% of the population, are diagnosed with depression.

2. In a 1999 study published in the American Journal of Public Health, 33% of respondents believed that an individual described as having Major Depressive Disorder was very or somewhat likely to do something violent to other people. In the same study, 47% of respondents had responses showing they were very or somewhat likely to desire ""social distance"" from a person described as having Major Depressive Disorder.

3. Since 1999, the American suicide rate has risen 33%, up to its highest level since World War II. 

4. This rise in suicides is a contributing factor in the American life expectancy having declined for 3 consecutive years. The last time the American life expectancy declined for 3 consecutive years was in 1915-1918, which saw World War I and the Spanish Flu. 

5. In the 1999 study mentioned in point #2, the authors of the study found a reasonable correlation between people believing that people with depression were more violent than others, and the public desire to have ""social distance"" from a person with Major Depressive Disorder. In reality, people with depression are generally no more dangerous than the average person.

6. More than 60% of US counties do not have a single practicing psychiatrist. 

7. Attitudes on mental health in America as of a May 2019 study published by the American Psychological Association include the following statistics:

* 33% of Americans do not believe anxiety is a mental illness.
* 22% of Americans do not believe depression is a mental illness.
* 33% of Americans agree with the following statement: “People with mental health disorders scare me.”
* 39% of Americans say they would view someone differently if they knew they had a mental health disorder.
* 21% of Americans would not feel comfortable associating with a person with a mental health disorder.
* 49% of Amerians would not feel comfortable dating someone with a mental health disorder.
* 65% of Americans would not feel comfortable letting someone with a mental health disorder care for a child.
* 30% of Americans would keep quiet about the cause of death if their loved one committed suicide.
* 63% of Americans believe that suicide is a selfish act.

I know my personality is not good but I just don't want it to get reminded about it again and again. 

And I guess that's why my self-esteem is really really low. I always think shit about myself whenever someone points out one of the negative qualities. I feel as if I'm a burden for them and get these stupid thoughts. Most of the times I feel that I don't have any positive traits.

That's why I talk less. Don't know if that's the only reason. I just don't know what to talk about. And this is one of my negative qualities. I don't engage with people. It has improved but yeah still i'm shit at it and most of the things.

Hi everyone!
I'm in university studying Comp Sci&amp;Eng, 3rd year. I have become a terrible student bc I hate my major. More details on that here: https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/dtmcla/im_in_university_and_i_still_dont_know_what_i/

Anyways, I am basically a plant. I have to take about 5 or 6 meds daily to function (believe me,I tried being off them, doesn't work) and I am in the second stage of my depression. I have been down this road before, so I know how it goes: First comes fits of constant crying and some other shit and then this: numbness.

I wake up at aboit 3-4 pm and I eat breakfast. I then stay in the kitchen, smoke and watch things until 3-4 am and then go back to sleep.  If i could, i would just sleep. All the time. 
I have a very loving bf of 1 year that I live with who is goinf through a very stressful perios amd he is really worriod about me. I don't feel like talking to anyone anyone about anything.
I am gonna go to my psychiatrist though. It's been a while bc he is far away, but I will. I doubt it'll do anything. I am just so tired all the time. 

I feel embarrassed talking about this with my close friends and family bc how many times have we been here? There is nothing new. What else am I gonna say? I feel like I let mt.family down, they're trying so hard to send me to yni and give me a good education and here i am, a sack of shit watching some bullshit on someone else's netflix. 

I don't know what to do. I find suicide selfish, i cant do that to my siblings, my friends and my family. And im too scared anyway. Yet I have no purpose, no motivation, no quality in life. I feel like an empty space. 
I wish everyone would save themselves from me but im terrified of being left alone. 

Anyways, i dont even know why im writing this here anymore. Reddit just sorta became this place for me.I guess. I used to have diaries. 

I suggest you read the link.  Its much better written.

Don't give me any bs positivity please. I hate that part of the internet and that part of the bookstores. I ""ain't all that"", its not ""all in me"", it wont"" get better with time."" I know suicide is not the anseer ok, I'm not gonna kill myself. I just...I dont  know. I dont know what you could comment really. I just wanted to...  talk to someone.

118,"I’m in a lot of distress right now and am struggling to think clearly, so I apologize beforehand for the choppy, out-of-order sentences. 

This is one of a few different accounts that I’ve been posting on these subs from. 

My ex broke up with me in early February, after an extremely toxic relationship full of him cheating and verbally abusing me. It was a seven month relationship. 

The other woman (his ex) was hospitalized for late-stage anorexia and a suicide attempt after we started dating (this happened a few months before the breakup). She blocked him permanently after her hospitalization. 

He asked for a month-long “break” before the breakup. During this break, I stayed with my mother at her house and he blocked me. 

At the end of the break, he took me back to our home (we were living together) and he told me he was never attracted to me and gave me an hour to pack and leave. He also left a pair of another woman’s panties on the bed. 

I got a hotel room and overdosed on my medications. Texted him and told him “no matter what happens, don’t please blame yourself.” 
He convinced me to let him know where I was, then he brought me to the hospital when I was blacked out. 

He immediately started a new relationship with one of the women he was cheating on me with. 

I moved into a new home and broke contact with him. 

He moved across the street from me with his family and asked for help moving. I caved in and helped him. 

Since this point, it’s been nothing but me pushing him away, him finding an excuse to see me, then telling me platitudes like “you’re the only person that truly knew me”, “I love you”, “I miss you”, “I think about you all the time”, “you’re my best friend”, “we’re still together in another world”, “I think about the children we didn’t have all the time”, etc. This is usually followed by him touching me and trying to have sex with me, threatening to leave if I don’t. When I don’t, he leaves and stops talking to me for a while. 

I refused to have sex with him the first several times he tried. Eventually, we were together once while I was drunk. He told me he loved me and convinced me that his relationship wasn’t going well and they were going to breakup. This was followed by him having very rough sex with me and threatening to kill me (this is hard to explain but something bdsm-related), which left me feeling extremely raw and vulnerable. Shortly after he admitted that their relationship is very serious and they’re getting an apartment together and planning on marriage. He left like nothing happened, and I tried to kill myself again, though this time the OD was less lethal (I nearly died the previous time), so we initiated no contact once I was in the hospital (this was a month ago). 

Two weeks ago, he texted me from his mom’s phone and told me he needed help taking care of his step-father with dementia because his mother was in the hospital. He confessed to me that she became suicidal after a fight they had. He admitted before to threatening to kill her since the move, and had expressed his resentment towards her for marrying his step-father when he was a child, and for not putting him in a care home now that he has dementia. 

This started the cycle all over again. Right now he’s with his Girlfriend at his parents’ house across the street from me (he lives with his family), and I feel like I can’t keep going through this. 

To clear things up, he’s 27, I’m 29, his current gf and ex are 19 and 21. so I know I have a little less of an excuse to be manipulated than they do. 

How do I handle this? He constantly lies and manipulates me. He knows this is ruining my life, why does he do this? I’m absolutely destroyed from this attachment trauma. I feel so weak and pathetic for giving in over and over. I know why I can’t let go of him, yet I let myself get pulled back in anyway.",15Nov2019,1

120,"Hi. I guess I'm just not sure if I have way to high expectations of life or if something is wrong with me. I guess my ""mood"" is just weird in the sense of what I think about life. One day I cant even find energy to do anything and just really think, ""Why live even"" and another day I feel about fine and dont tginj about dying at all. I just feel like the moment I get left alone to just ""relax"", like when I stop working in something it stop talking to people, my mind just comes to the conclusion life isnt really worth it in the end. I either feel tired or super powered and everything seems fine. 
I do believe I've gotten better overall. I can't even remember how it was really like when I was younger in details. But I know I've seriously considered suicide for several years but I've just never gotten the balls or energy to do it. I've been thinking a lot on maybe just overdosing on something but I just cant bother I guess.
But in the meantime i do have passions and can work for hours on projects. Sitting but still. And sure be tired but be totally fine meanwhile but 10 minutes later I'm thinking of killing myself.
Idk why I wrote this, maybe someone has some ideas or can relate to this in any way. Honestly I'm not very optimistic shit will change. I'm more leaning towards the idea everyone is like me, I just haven't realized yet. Even though it may sound retarded from how I'm describing it. Maybe it feels worse than it actually is u know.

132,"TLDR: I’m having mental health struggles and I need to store my firearm somewhere that will prevent me from accessing it until I feel better. Asking for suggestions.

I’ve been having some mental health struggles for the past year or so. I’ve been on a rapidly changing regimen of psychotropic medications that have caused me to have difficultly controlling my thoughts and emotions. At times I feel very bad and, while I have not attempted to intentionally physically harm myself, I also know that I cannot 100% guarantee that I would never try that when I’m feeling my worst. I’ve stopped taking psychotropic medications (with the approval of my doctor) and I’m hoping to return to “normal”; hopefully soon. In the mean time, I have to try to keep myself safe while I wait for the turmoil that I’m currently experiencing to subside. 

I grew up in a rural area where everyone owns guns. I currently only have one firearm in my home and it is locked in a relatively inaccessible place inside a small lockbox. While I don’t know the combination to the lockbox, I could easily crack the lock in a few minutes, if I was so inclined. My wife has been upset by the fact that I’ve had feeling of SI over the last few months and we just found out that our next door neighbor took his own life a few days ago. Considering all of that, my wife has asked me to store the firearm somewhere else, where it will not be so easily accessible or in our home. I understand and respect where she’s coming from and I am not opposed to giving up access to my firearm while I am recovering. I am wondering if anyone has any suggestions for where I could store it so that I would not have access to it. Here are the things I’ve considered and the issues I’ve found with each.

Store at a friends house - I am a very introverted person and I don’t really have any friends that I would be comfortable with telling about the struggles that I am facing, much less asking them to keep a firearm for me. The only friend that I’ve talked to about my situation is someone who is also struggling with the same thing so I can’t ask him to keep my firearm when he has someone else keeping his. 

Store at a family members house - Again, I am very introverted even/especially around my family. My wife is my only family member that is aware of what I’ve been going through lately. I am not comfortable sharing the details of my struggles with my family so I can’t just ask them to keep my gun with no further explanation. 

Store it in a safe deposit box - This seemed like a relatively good idea but it seems that most banks do not allow you to store guns inside their vaults. Also, I’d technically have access to it during business hours, which isn’t ideal but realistically that would probably still prevent me from actually accessing it since I’d have to talk to people to get access to it. 

Gun storage services - Apparently this is a thing, but not in my area. 

Self Storage locations - Not ideal because I’d have 24/7 access to it and you’re not technically allowed to store firearms there because of the way unclaimed property is disposed of at those locations. 

Red Flag Laws - I don’t want to get law enforcement involved and, even if I did, my state doesn’t have such laws.",15Nov2019,1

138,"There are probably many posts on here and other websites about someone talking about their situtation. I guess this would be another one of those. Hopefully someone out there can help me. 

For some background, I'm a 27 year old male. My parents divorced when I was 3, they spent the majority of my life fighting over alimony  and time spent with us. Never went to post-secondary out of high-school. I really started probing at my mental health around the age of 19. I spent the first year out of high school barely moving, I did not know at the time I was dealing with depression. The only thing I seemed to want to do was go out and drink which overtime turned into addiction. In high school I would skip a lot, I found it quite boring to sit in a class room. I usually was ahead of the teacher and I felt like school was a waste (obviously it is not). I started drinking in high-school every weekend at parties, and weed has been a crutch since about 18 but I started using it around 16. 

The best place to start is high school, due to skipping class, my marks were around 60-70%. The weird thing is that I was content with that. I knew I could get it higher I didn't care at the time and I regret it a lot. About a month before grad I was told if I didn't get an 84% or higher on my math Diploma I would not be graduating, since I was sitting at 34% in Math for the second time. The catch was my Math diploma was in a week. I am not by any means bad at math and can do long equations in my head, but skipping 90% of classes will do that to your math. So I did the only thing I could and taught my self the math curriculum. In less than a week span. Unbelievable right? I thought going in I would fail, but I didn't. I had a 89% on my diploma which meant I graduated with 53%. Close. This is when I should have realized I was holding my self back. I didn't. When I was younger and in school, I never had to try. No homework no studying, always floated by with 70-80% till later in my high school life. 

During high school I found my self in a very toxic relationship. I was emotionally and physically abused. It's not easy saying or writing that as a male. I watched her almost end her life, I spent months in the asylum with her for her to get better. I spent a lot of my energy chasing her and helping her out and so did my Mom. This lasted till I was about 21 when I finally left. My relationships after have been okay, but ended with the other person being unfaithful. I don't get jealous, I am nice, help them out, I never could understand what I did to make them cheat. 

One night at a buddies he was showing us his hunting rifles. He took one out and they all are suppose to be unloaded. Well he was swinging it around and it was pointed right at my face, not even 4 inches past it had moved and it went off. I never thought it really messed with me. But I was wrong. I can't have someone point anything at me. Nothing. It's messed with me a lot. 

Right out of high school till I was 19, I legit played video games, got drunk and laid in bed. I saw a few psychologists and psychiatrists but I wasn't even listening to me having mental health problems. I started taking a anti-anxiety drug during this for the first time.

This story is 100% real. I feel crazy, I have been able to do weird stuff since I was a kid. When I was 20 we went to my friends acreage. There was an old abandoned cabin from the early 40's there. There were a couple stories before this that cause my friends and I to do this. But we found out I could communicate with ghosts. I don't know if it's real but this blew about 20 young men away. So we enter this cabin, its split off evenly down the middle into two rooms. The first you enter is a kitchen, living room it was decorated kind of like out of the 70's. The next room was a bedroom, now this room had two twin beds in PRESTINE condition and a dresser that had no mirror and looked like it came straight from IKEA. So we enter the second, I read enough about ghosts to know this room would be a good one. When I entered it was like I was in another reality, kind of like a flashback movie scene. I saw a man delivering a baby, the woman was in a white garment, dark hair screaming, sweating. (during this, my friends said I was as white as snow) in my left ear I heard another cry, it was twins. I had just seen her deliver two babies, I then looked back to see the man in a state of panic over the woman. He was asking her to respond, she wasn't. Dead. I just saw a lady give birth, then die. Right as she passed I heard my friends( only two in the room with me) saying my name. I came too randomly and as soon as I did I dropped through the floor. It felt like a million pounds shoved me in. This story sounds insane at this point my friends and I think I am insane. We went back out, not much was said about it but I knew others were talking. The next day I woke up and felt super depressed, it was my birthday and this was happening. So I did what any 20 year old does. Got super drunk and passed out by noon. This is were you go what the fuck. While I was sleeping, a car drove up, it was a family that use to live on that land. The lady who drove up.. was a girl who was born in that house.... she had a twin... and her Mom died in labor. This has been apart of my whole life. Not just effecting my in ghost ways either. I feel CRAZY!!! This isn't the first time something happened, but it was the last I allowed it.

From age 19-22 I worked as a lot attendant. It was a very easy job. It was about a month into working, I decided to drive after going out to the bar. It doesn't matter how I felt, what matters is I made a mistake and was now losing my license shortly after I finally started to work as an adult. I messed up and I hit the skids hard. Something that seems to be prevalent in my life.

When I was 22 I started working in what would be the best/worst place for me mentally. Restaurant life. I started out as a busser, worked my up to bartender in about 6 months. I obviously started to go out more than I ever had, spent money freely, and just drank. It was fun but it doesn't convey this reality. After working at one restaurant I left and went to bartending school, worked on Whyte ave in Edmonton where I live. Wasn't my scene, was fun. But the violence after everything closed down was enough for me to dip out.

On my 23rd birthday. I almost died again. I was at friends lake and we decided to go boating. It ended up flipping and I was carried back to shore by my buddy. I had hypothermia and my body temp was .2 degrees above dead. 

 I found myself eventually managing a huge chain restaurant when I was 23 not even a month later. It was a blast but during this time is when my addiction really kicked in and took control. Due to the long hours, and always closing, I never saw the light, I was depressed more than ever, I was seeking help and being put on prescriptions while having to manage and the prescriptions were causing weird side effects. Panic attacks every day, Id stay up till 6-8 am drinking, gaming. I was dating a girl at the time and I couldn't even pay attention to her., I wonder if that's what pushed her to someone else. Regardless; after turning 23 and managing, I was out of a job shortly after turning 24 because of my Mental Health.

Since being fired I have really struggled. I bounced around at a couple restaurants, at one it was okay but I missed where I used to be. I was back working nights all the time and now not managing but bartending. I was misdiagnosed as well during this. I was told I had ADD which I do not, so the prescription drugs I was given sent me to the hospital twice.  I left there to work at another place, had to leave after about a year and a half from depression. Now I sit at 27, I haven't worked in a year. I lost my nice car I had, I accumulated thousands in debt which I had to file a consumer proposal. I still don't have any answers or a direction to go. 

During this time I found out I am dealing with PTSD, Hypersensitivity, depression and anxiety. 

I have taken I.Q tests and I feel like I am really wasting myself away sitting here. The lowest number I have seen is 141 the highest was 188. I always have seem to grasp anything and understand. I have had people tell me so often I see the world different. I never view any type of information or system as unlearnable. Not a fan of using the term Genius as I have never been told I am and there is always someone who offers intelligence in their own right. 

I feel like I have gone everywhere and I'm still so lost. Probably sounds like the same rant, pick up your socks the answers within me yada yada, but feels like I'm missing my trajectory in life really bad. My parents fighting didn't help growing up. Almost dying multiple times. The paranormal things that happen. Spending my time fixing other people and not learning about myself. I truly don't know who to talk to or go. So internet, help please. I can answer any questions or am open to talking, chances are I have missed some things that have happened. Thank you.",15Nov2019,1

141,"Hi, first time posting here but I don't really know what to do about this. I am a 29 year old female living in NC, USA. I have never seen a mental health professional of any kind. For the past oh...fifteen years or more I have flirted with depression, self harm, etc. As a child I bit my fingernails own to the quick and kept them there. I have always done little things to hurt myself, like picking my skin or just hitting parts of my body on doorframes, etc until they bruised. Things also get stuck in my head very easily and replay like a record on repeat. This can be a song or movie clip or anything. In the last two years I have really taken a turn for the worst, and my depression got a bit out of control. I found it very hard to eat, bathe, and brush my teeth. I was starving myself in order to punish myself and I felt alienated from my body, name, gender and even by BIRTHDAY. Bizarre, I know. I felt subhuman.

I have started down the right track. I am eating well, running, weightlifting, going for nature walks and hikes, grooming myself well and wearing makeup I love. BUT...in the past two weeks I have developed a tic that disturbs me. I am saying phrases out loud that I don't mean to say. I don't consciously want to say them but they bubble out. My mind races a lot and this couples with my ""getting stuck"" on thoughts, so I will be thinking of a song, an internet meme, or just be doing some internal self-talk. I will...say the phrase I am thinking, or part of that phrase, out loud. So far it has all been innocuous stuff. For example, I was at work and remembered the tumblr meme edit of Smash Mouth ""All Star"" that goes, ""Well the years start comin' and they don't stop comin'and they don't stop comin' and they don't stop comin'"". I actually verbally repeated ""and they don't stop--"" before I stopped myself. I didn't want to say that at all but it slipped out!

I want to stop doing this. Any suggestions appreciated. I know I probably need CBT but that's expensive in Hamburgerland. I am also wondering if anyone else struggles with this, and if it went away for them. Thanks in advance.",15Nov2019,1

148,"Warning Long Story: I met a girl in August of last year and talked for about a month. She ended up dating some other guy, no big deal.. Fast forward to March of this year and we start talking and hanging out again. We talked about the feelings we had for each other ( FYI I am 24 year old male and this was the first girl I’ve ever had feelings for) Well she ends up cheating on him.. I felt horrible and I know she did too.. 

She breaks up with him soon after but once she called it off it’s like she completely lost interest in me, She says she just wanted to be friends And every time I ask what happened she gets upset and says “idk”  why is this? 

Side note: This put me into a pretty rough depression.. i care about her more than I can put into words but it’s so hard seeing her be with other guys. It’s it possible to be friends despite my overwhelming feelings for her?",15Nov2019,1
149,"Occasionally I get these short episodes where I begin to feel a bit woozy. Then my mind begins to think I’m not living in the present and instead what I thought was my current time is actually just my brain is replaying memories from the past. But it seems as if while replaying memories it’s trying to snap back to what it thinks is the actual present- this present not even existing because my present isn’t in the past. I’m sorry if that’s confusing but it’s tricky to explain. It’s never significant memories, and there doesn’t seem to be any pattern between when I get them. I’ve had them when I’m stressed and when I’m not. They can happen anywhere. I’ve no idea what this is and honestly they just drain me. I know I’ve got it easy compared to what other people suffer on a daily basis though so I’m trying to keep that in mind. However any ideas on what it is would be appreciated; otherwise thank you for reading my rant, it’s appreciated :)",15Nov2019,1
