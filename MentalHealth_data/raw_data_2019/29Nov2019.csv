1,"I know Thanksgiving is just another day, but social norms seem to put tons of emphasis on it, especially here in the Southeast US. My family is so dysfunctional and scattered we really just gave up on gathering together when I was about 17. For the past 16 years I've been fortunate enough to be invited by friends to their family gatherings. The food is always good, but it's quite emotionally difficult for me. This year some friends invited me to join them for dinner, but I opted not to. I just didn't want to, and my dog is way better company. I enjoyed my day at home watching movies and chilling with my pup. This meant no awkward introductions to random family members, not having to explain why my family wasn't gathering, or telling my life story over and over again. It also meant that I didn't have to worry about getting triggered by family arguments that inevitably occur when everyone is in the same place. When I finally decided I wanted to eat, Waffle House is where I ended up...because who doesn't love Waffle House? It was really the most freeing experience to be able to do whatever I wanted and not deal with families and the shame that I always feel during holidays.",29Nov2019,1

3,"I’m posting this on a throw away just because I feel better about it. I’d like to discuss something I’m going through right now and look for possible answers to what I’m experiencing. 

Last summer, I was chilling with my friends and had a minor negative interaction with someone which I totally ignored. A good few hours pass and eventually someone comes up to me screaming and shouting, and violently pushes me multiple times to try and fight me. I get very upset because this is not an environment or situation I’m used to and I run away. It’s been a whole year now and I’m still not over this situation. I have not been back to the spot where this event happened nor do I leave the house unless it’s for school, which still puts me on edge and makes me anxious as i feel like he’s going to be waiting round the corner for me because someone has said something to him about me. I’m worried sick and lose sleep a lot over it. I managed to live without thinking about it and worrying about it too much up until very recently when I have become so worried about it. I don’t know, I just need answers. It could be nothing.",29Nov2019,1
4,"I looked through my journal and noticed that 7/10 entries are so depressing. This journal spreads across 3+ years of my life. 

I keep thinking about the people I knew who have died who should've taken my place. I don't deserve to live more than they did. I should've been my mom's miscarriage. My existence is just miserable for no reason. I have no reason to be this miserable and I'm really trying but every day is a fight and I'm so tired. 

My therapist is stumped she wants me to try another medication because I'm doing everything I should be doing to get better but I keep getting worse. But most of the medications I've gone through have also just made me feel worse. I'm on one still right now that has kept me going through the motions. I'm not having panic attacks and I'm scraping by in life doing what I need to do. But I'm having such brain fog it makes me feel terribly inept, and in my head are just constant playbacks of everything I've ever done that could be considered cringey or hurtful, or random very un-fun facts about the world. I cry at small innocuous things, or sometimes I just shut down entirely. I can't make decisions anymore. I cry when trying to decide what to make myself for dinner, and I end up with pathetic scraps thrown together. It's mostly a lot of spaghetti. I'm at my best when my mind is blank. 

I feel like I'm going insane but I am unfairly very aware of it. I have dreams and desires and strong emotions. I know who I actually am and this isn't it. But I've also dealt with some variation of mental instability all my life. So it is definitely a part of me. I had plans to get married to my SO. It would make me so happy, I fantasize about my wedding sometimes to keep me here.  But it's never going to happen. Marrying me would be like adopting a child, I'm a massive burden. And it could all be for nothing when I end up killing myself anyways.",29Nov2019,1
5,"I think very negatively, I've tried to stop, but I just cannot stop thinking like this, and I also assume just because someone says something or does something, I assume it's because of me, for example, if i see my dad locks his bedroom door when he leaves, and he usually doesnt, i assume it's because he thinks i stole something, when in reality it's because of something completely different. Or if i see my dad is whispering something to my stepmom, i automatically assume they're either a.) Talking bad about me, or b.) They don't trust me so they keep it from me, when, in reality, it's because my little brother is asleep next to me and they don't want to wake him. Please help, I just believe myself to be very cynical, but apart of me think's I've got something mentally wrong with me, i know I've got really really bad anxiety and social anxiety, but i have no idea how to fix any of this, and i feel like it's making my mind break down... I'm too embarrassed to go see a school therapist or tell my dad about this...but i honestly don't know what else to do..",29Nov2019,1
6,"this is my first time posting on reddit so i dont really know how these things stat but here goes.

im a 17 yr highschool student and i just seem to have so many things that im worrying about on my mind im having a lot of trouble concentrating and my grades have really begun to slip. Theres one thing thats been bothering me the most though recently. this event occurred over the past weekend. I was at a friends house and yknow we ended up getting a little ""under the influence"" and during this time i did something that im disappointed about. I hooked up with this girl but the thing is I dont really remember where it started and when i was in a sober state of mind i realized  that in fact i didnt want to do that at all and im still disgusted about it. this person is kind of considered unfavourable by most people i know and my friends have been jokingly busting my balls about it. But i keep thinking back to that night and i keep wishing that i didnt do it, that somehow i could've just forgotten it ever happened. today at school i punched a locker because i got mad and at lunch i just felt like i had to be alone and out of nowhere i just started shedding tears. Now this is later on is the day and im feeling much better but i just want to get this problem out of my mind.",29Nov2019,1
7,"So, I opted to stay home today while my parents went to my aunt's house for Thanksgiving. They're staying overnight and I have the house to myself! It's wonderful!

I did yoga, took a luxurious hot shower, and washed all of my bedding. I don't get to wash my bedding as often as I should because my mom gets mad when I use the washer/dryer (she's a hoarder with control issues) and so when I do laundry, I usually only have time for my clothes. 

Then I made macaroni and cheese (the Annie's brand from a box, one of my favorite comfort foods) and now I'm feeling clean and cozy and comfy in my favorite jam-jams with clean sheets as a bonus. I feel so good right now. &lt;3",29Nov2019,1
8,"So I’m in year 10 (1.5years from graduating secondary). My childhood wasn’t great (mainly at school), but I consider myself lucky, and there was some medical stuff a few years ago which has been traumatic both physically and mentally, though everyone thinks I’m handling everything fine. But I’m not, I don’t know if it has to do with my fucked up memories from my early and mid childhood, or with my medical stuff, or stuff that’s happening now with the stress of preparing for going into the adult world... or a combination of everything? I’ve gone through some serious mental health stuff a few years ago, though it seemed to go away without anyone else’s help... but it’s back for round 2. 

I just want everyone to leave me alone, but I’m forced to socialize on a daily basis. People think I’m weak just because i can’t deal with people being upset with me. People think I’m stuck up just because i can’t deal with being late or doing anything that could get me in trouble. Teachers don’t see what was going on in my mind when they say hello in passing in the hallways. I try to reach out to my friends, but they don’t hear my calls for help. Even if they did, I still wouldn’t be too happy ; they’d inevitably tell my parents. My goal is to try and get through until I can seek help for myself without parents. 

Anyways, I just needed to get some stuff out there.",29Nov2019,1
9,"I remember almost nothing of my childhood Thanksgivings, only that my family often hosted and we'd have people from all over the country filling our house.  We'd play board games and go shopping and I think it was fun?  All I know is that now I see the dysfunction of the remaining family members, self included, and all the fun people are gone.  I definitely didn't grow up to be one.  As an adult I'm a twitchy PTSD-ridden scaredycat who would hide in the bathroom and look like a hunted animal in the photos.

So I avoided family this year and have no friends to hang with this long weekend.  It's still fairly early in the evening where I am. I already took my sleep meds.  Except for the fact that I have pets to care for, I wish I could sleep until Monday.  Or forever.  I don't know what's worse, the memories, gaps in memories, loneliness, PTSD, agoraphobia, or depression.  It's all bad.

13,"I have watched this subreddit for a long while, never got to close, but I guess would be worth writing on here, I have alot of mental illness but I don't really need to take about it in deep, but I thought i would talk about money buying happiness.

I was raised in a middle/higher class world, bought a bigger home every four years, father had the latest gadgets, nice audis or whatever he wanted, mum didn't have a job, we spent months on holiday  every other season. Me and my younger sibling were given whatever. My mother started wanting to get into work because  she was a business lady and was finding unemployment difficult. When I was 11 my father and her were fighting and they separated, divorce proved my dad never actually paid for much, it was all on finance and he was in debt, divorce usually allocates fair currency to both but as we didn't have anything owned, we came away with not a penny, however my mother was signed off from the owing my father had caused so no debt is better than nothing I suppose. I never saw him once the divorce was finished. My mum had to work, look after me and my sibling, we lived in a tiny council apartment with only two bedrooms, mum slept in the sitting room so me and him could have a room to ourselves. We didn't have a car for ages and she had to cycle to her job which was far away. We couldn't afford luxuries but we had to learn to value the tiny moments

I left education to go to work and was able to land a highly paid position  in bank fraud and was able to feel like I had as a kid, spending cash on cars and crap that doesn't actually  do alot for anyone. But after a long time I was so mentally ill I was removed from employment  entirely.  I actually got in tens of thousands of debt which I have to start paying next year. I lived in my car and abused substance and abused the friendships and family generosity to get cash to pay for my habit. 

I often had no cash to have any dinner, and my mates would support it.

Anyway to keep it brief, after 2 years being on illness checks, I have now been working and got a promotion. Having cash in my wallet is such a great feeling. But I realised it's not the ability  to purchase things for myself, it's the fact that I can help others, and know that I always have just enough to get my dinner without crying because I cant have food.
I can buy other people things, i can get them dinner, i can donate to those who require

17,"Hello. I'm happy. I finally am certain I want to experience death. I am a 13 year old boy in freshman year of high school, and what happened finally solidified that I will die. I'm in Kentucky for thanksgiving. I watched by cousins dog get run over by a car. I thought it would never happen. I got in a fight with my dad about how he doesn't care about anything. my parents are going through a divorce and my dad didn't care about my asking him if he could change the custody so I could get away from my terrible, manipulative, verbally abusive mom. I'm trying to get friends and a girlfriend at school but I don't know how to interact socially, and for some reason I'm the smallest in all of my peers and I'm having issues with sexual development. I've been trying so hard to stop being such a fucking terrible person but I just can't. I have social anxiety and I don't see the purpose in living anymore. All life started billions of years ago in a pool of water on the hot boiling earth. T was constantly under threat by the environment around it and it would have been so easy for it to die out and leave earth a lifeless rock. Instead it evolved to make everything we know. I wish it hadnt. I've been dealth the short stick in everything I do. There is just so much suffering in the world and I don't matter at all, except the world I can't escape from. I just dont see a point In living. My dad who I love is going to die in 20-30 years and there is nothing I can do to stop it. Nothing matters in the universe in everywhere, except if you live here you have to suffer for your entire life or be labeled as crazy. I won't be famous, nobody will except for a few. Ibwontbe able to do what I want when I want it. I have to try to keep my grades up or else I won't be able to do stuff I know there will be people being like no that isn't true but it is and then you have to work at a job you can't control that in order to make money and live and then you get to retire if your lucky and wait to develop painful ailments and die. The moments that are fun aren't worth it. It's just so easy to not have to suffer. Even if I say I want to kill myself I get to be in a hospital and then people will notice and maybe change but I don't think so I can just wait and convince people I'm fine and then go to a gun range and point the gun at myself at shoot myself and I'll be happy because I won't have to suffer anymore and nobody can.

18,"Well, hello

It's my first time posting. I'm anxious even about this, that's the level of anxiety and depression that i've achieved

I wanted to talk about relapses. After five years of depression, I've had my best two months in recent years. It was two months straight with medication (almost) up to date, meditation, yoga, searching my spirituality ... Feeling, for the first time in years, content to be just me and able to enjoy being alive. 


I had recently resigated from an internship in law. In the country where I live, it takes five years of course to get a bachelor's degree and then be able to act as a lawyer after taking the ""bar"" exam.

Turns out I was in college seven years ago. I haven't been to classes since 2015, when I lost my scholarship. Since then, every semester I paid for 1 course (something like a credit) to keep me enrolled, so I could keep working. At the time, I was worried and obsessed with having a source of income at any cost. My parents don't have a good income and although I didn't need to give money at home, they couldn't give me more than shelter and food. I knew that  I was privileged in having that, after all, i had some friends who were, already at 19, paying bills.

I also never adapted in college. Not being able to make friends and it was a period where I began to exonerate, stronger than in my teens, symptoms of social phobia. My self-esteem was very low, and studying on a college scholarship with well-off people I ended up feeling lower. But I kept holding on, working, paying what I could and trying to have a perfect romantic relationship . I freaked out. The depression over the years got worse. I couldn't go to class even though I got the scholarship again. 
I would get to the classes door and couldn't enter. I just couldn't and made plausible excuses for myself about why it was okay to miss class. As long as I didn't have to admit to myself that I had social phobia. So, after starting therapy, I decided that i  could no longer stand law anymore. 

Even so, I didn't cancel my registration. Part of me really wanted that, since it was always my dream to be a lawyer since I was a child. I just felt it wasn't for me and I couldn't do It anymore.

Without going to school, they canceled my scholarship again. I didn't want to face that this was happening again and pretend nothing was happening. Then I quit the internship because I stopped studying. It was a very good internship, but I couldn't stand being there again. I was late every day. My performance has fallen. I was constantly thinking that the people in my work didn't like me. I thought no one liked me and I felt wronged by them. 

The first month after the resignation wad hard ajd good. Difficult because I was staying more at home, a place that was never very pleasant. In my house, although we love each other, we also have a lot of resentment toward each other . My father is bipolar and has always refused treatment, which is why it was sometimes impossible to have peace around him. Until I was 8, 9 years old he still had relapses into alcoholism and although  he didn't hit us, he was verbally violent. When the manic phase passed, he apologized and was a good father.  


So this first month was difficult for these reasons and more, but if I report it all, i wont stop typing. 

The good thing is that the next month I went to spend the month at my aunt's house. She is not an easy person but she takes care of herself, her house is nice and I love her daughter, my nine year old cousin. Getting away from home was difficult, but it was rewarding. I've done things that I feel I can't do where I live because I don't have space, time, feel stressed, find it impossible for me.

The next month when I came home was good. I was feeling strong and capable, no longer judging myself so harshly, and I was willing to move on. during this period on my aunt's house, My old internship boss called me to work with him again and I accepted. I would study this semester and then dream. Before doing that I was determined to tie all the loose ends of my life.

I didn't smoke weed every day for the first time in two years. I had become a heavy user because it was the only thing in my life that still made me feel pleased to be alive. With cannabis, I could read, be interested in new subjects, and even socialize. I made my first new friend in years through the drug. He used to call me to smoke after work, (an previous job) where I met him, and se talked first cause he didnt want to smoke alone. I needed this break at that time. I could at least take a breath, even though my life has been stagnant in that 2 years

It turns out that after these unused months and my life and mood improved, I felt it was time to stop. However, when I went to try to tie such loose ends, I had The relapse . I couldn't get money to enroll in college again. I did not borrow from relatives who would lend me because I was ashamed. My family doesn't know half of what goes on. They know I am depressed, but they are also depressed. Occasionally they are worried but stay with it. They eventually encourage me to take the medication and taking care of myself, but they have too much trouble so I always struggle to say that it's okay with the rest of my life, even though I'm clearly depressed.My older brother has mental problems, my younger sister has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and they are always having financial troubles. 


In the middle of this there is still my relationship. I've been with my boyfriend since I was 19. During the worst phase of depression, he stood by me in every way he knew and could, including financially. He's always been a good boyfriend, but last year has been tough for us. Communication between us has become impossible and we have been fighting every day. He has a lot of resentment about the way I treated him during those years. There were times when I looked like my father. Aggressive, speaking words to assault. Always anxious and afraid that he would leave me. I felt like I didn't deserve him so i kept pushing hiim from me.

Our quality time together has fallen, we have had little sex. At the time of relapse, he was treating me very badly. He said he had given up trying because I was too hard to handle. He said that the best month of his life was far from me. But he didn't want to break up when I proposed. He told me that he knew both of them were responsible for the fall of the relationship him that he loved me very much. Well, I still believed in this love, because I was really changing my attitude so why not forgive him and move on? I proposed termination before relapse. When he didn't accept it, I told him I wanted some time, we had a long discussion about our relationship and we split up for a week.Then we got closer and everything was great. It turns out that recently he has been experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression, and fights have returned with force. Therapy has held me back, but that's all. These last months I've been very bad. How could I be in the way of healing the depression and have llowed myself to get worse?I then started to get worse, to have more self-destructive thoughts. I got to a point where I wondered if I had bipolar disorder The psychiatrist said no and handed me 50 mg. But at the same time, I'm using marijuana again every day and I know it interferes with the effect of medication
I have been sleeping too little and too late for a long time. I walk without squeezing and when I eat, I feel like throwing up. I lost a lot of weight. My thoughts are faster than ever and I'm constantly with body pain and stiff muscles.I have some good days, usually the day after therapy where I do a light exercise, I feel hopeful ... But nothing that last more than onde day.
I know what he theory has to do to improve. I read a lot and find out. I read about psychology, alternative therapies. I know I should have a routine with my good practices. I know I should settle my dream and stop weed. But it seems to me very difficult. I know habits are hard to create and it takes persistence But sometimes I get lost thinking ... what's the point? I don't have fun in a long time and I I don't know how it is like anymore to feel pleasure in months, either with food or sex. 
I can't enjoy eating, something I've always enjoyed, not reading, watching movies, having sex. I dont want to sleep and it's not that I can't, I don't feel like sleeping and fight the tiredness.My relationship is in shambles. I, who have always prided myself on being highly intelligent and always dreaming high, can no longer believe in my po I think I'm a failure and crazy. In good times, I feel compassion for myself and feel trapped inside my mind. Like she takes me hostage using anxiety The fast-paced thoughts, the depression. Sometimes I feel strong and able to dominate the mind, but most of the time, I feel undead. My days are all the same and happiness is just a distant memory .

Well, anyway, I just wanted to vent. Few people really know what's happening to me and nobody knows everything. Thank you to anyone who has read. After all, I, who have always been an optimistic child, still believe that I will have strength and make it different, it's just a matter of time. However, it is very difficult to fight having the mind itself as an opponent.",29Nov2019,1

20,"Late 30’s male.  Great wife, kids, job, and overall life as it appears on paper.  Dealt with pretty bad anxiety my entire life.  Trust issues.  In my mid 20’s I started a job in retail (terrible I know).  Spent about a decade dealing with the public.  During this time I developed a strong hatred toward humanity.... not just the typical “I hate my job, I hate dealing with bad people” stuff... but to the point where in my mind, I’d love nothing more than to see horrific things happen to absolute strangers.  I figured after leaving retail that things would calm down, but it’s only gotten worse.  One of the few forms of joy I experience in life is seeing terrible things happen to the human species (excluding children).   Killings, natural disasters, and any sort of population reduction in general brings me great joy.  Now, I’m not the type to actually hurt anyone or anything, but my inner rage is never ending.  Even just walking past strangers in public, I wish they would just no longer exist.  Now, where things get interesting is that I am cursed with “niceness”.  Regardless of my internal hate and rage, I don’t have to ability to be mean to anyone, even if I dislike them or they did something to wrong me.  Always been considered the “nicest guy you’ll ever meet”... which is mainly because they have no idea of what goes on inside my head.  I can’t discuss this with anyone..  It’s for sure a good vs evil scenario.  Been considering talking to a therapist but also don’t trust them and if I truly opened up to anyone, they would be terrified.

21,"Its hard for me to focus for any amount of time right now . So what's been really bothering:
I met this girl and we fell in love. It was amazing for 3 months.  We would have been together for five months in December 22, and we started off as friends back in april orf his year. Took it slow and fell in love. During our four months relationship she cheated on me, and come to find out she had multiple boyfriends even before she asked me to be hers. I love this girl with all of my heart. So I thought to myself that I wanted to stay with her that things would change, but she cheated on me again, and another time . She has like 7 boyfriend

I dont know what to do. It doesnt bother me that much that she cheated, but it is still not right. Its shitty. I broke things off with her tonight. My.qiestion is how do I stay no contact with her? It seems impossible for me, I suppose I lack a lot of self control. I'm impulsive most of the time, so when she texts me after I break up with her and she is calling me baby girl and stuff and that she loves me so much  I just immediately reply to her, and just like that I've been sicked back in.

22,"I live in Ontario, Canada.

I was seeing a therapist for a while who said she thought I had schizophrenia. Since she isn't qualified to diagnose (and I've got a bunch of other shit that needs actual treatment), she referred me to a psychiatrist. I saw him once. He asked me if I thought I had OCD, to which I said no. He didn't say anything about schizophrenia.

I met with my GP a bit later and she told me she had spoken with him and under his advice, prescribed me Seroquel, which is primarily used to treat bipolar and schizophrenia, neither of which I've been diagnosed with.

I also saw when my GP was looking through his notes on her computer that he wrote ""...probably because of the PTSD."" He never said anything about PTSD to me either. 

Do I have a legal right to know if I've been diagnosed with something? I asked my GP to see that document and she told me I'd need consent from the psychiatrist because it's his private documents, but that doesn't feel right because it's something that was written about me.",29Nov2019,1
23,"I will begin to feel like i'm floating away from my body or detached from my body. It can happen when i sitting, walking, or lying down.

It had completely woken me up, then it would randomly get much worse for a few seconds. It stopped after a few minutes of being awake and sitting up out of bed.

I feel like no one is ever gonna love me now that I'm getting old. I feel like since  im not gonna be a hot young teen anymore I wont be found attractive to people.

I havent even been able to do anything in 4 years since I moved out. I've been poor and unable to do anything fun but work. The past 4 years just flew by and it looks like that's how it's always gonna be. I look back and get so upset at myself for not doing anything and being too tired from working so much to even want to do anything. It's so upsetting. Especially since everyday I hear older people talking about how they regret basically their entire lives because they never got to do what they wanted to and that it just flew by and they never got to enjoy it. I want to enjoy my life but when I need to work 73 hours to support myself in this fucked up world it's kinda hard especially since all my extra money seems to just not exist at the end of the week. 

I feel like it's just over. Idk why but seriously feel like I'm gonna die soon all the time and I constantly miss out on everything. I hate how I feel like its over and my entire life I'll be working and making money for someone else so they can have the life I've always wanted :( 

any one know how I can not think like that anymore? Make that go away? I hate feeling like my life is over...",29Nov2019,1
26,"I am a 16yo female. This year has not been the best for me mentally, since I am struggling with some anxiety when in public and sometimes feel hopeless, that I will not get future and those kind of things. Luckily I was in therapy and it helped me a lot to get out of my house and make friends. I even have a gf now,and she's been the one holding me together! I am not depressed, nor think I have any kind of mental illness (not at the point I would accept medication), but I sometimes think about suicide (am better now) and do some self destructive things (self-harm I am clean for a straight month). This is just some context though. The problem is that I keep looking at and searching horrible things in internet, some just spooky and disturbing, or having a strong feeling where I should hurt myself. Hell I even explored some contents on the so called ""deep web"" (nothing involving kids, these kind of people are the most disgusting) because looking and watching shocking things makes me feel better. Still, I feel guilty because of that, but can't find any other way to cope. Since I was little I was interested in spooky things, like ghost stories and whatnot, but sometimes it seems like it's going a little over the edge, taking a turn where it's desensitizing me. What can I do? Should I really change or it will go away, like my mom says? She has experience with mental health struggle and said the medicine didn't help. I stopped therapy because it wasn't helping, and because I wasn't comfortable enough since she recommended a psychiatrist. I feel unwell, but not at the point where I should take medicine, because I have fun, laugh a lot and feel like wanna be something in life overall.",29Nov2019,1
27,"I’ve recently moved to university housing, away from my parents. At this time I started therapy and started to get better with binging and purging (To make it clear I am diagnosed with Bulimia nervosa).

Two weeks passed and everything had been alright until I moved back to my parents’ house for winter break.

29,"Okay, just to clarify, I'm not a troller. When I say I'm a kid, I mean it; because I had an issue with that on my last post. Also, no trash-talking me telling me things like: ""Oh your just a kid,"" or any of that crap. Anyways, onto the post!

 Hello Everyone! My name's Mack (I made this account to post personal info about myself), and I'm twelve years old; and I'm autistic. It's pretty rough, though I'm easily able to get through it! Recently I came out to my class about my condition, and there very supportive! I also find being masked to be a very natural thing for me.

Anyway, when I was doing some research, I figured out that many autistic people also suffer from depression, or bipolar disorder; which is why I told you guys I'm autistic. I took quite a few quizzes online to help me figure myself out, and all of them said that I had bipolar (and I know these quizzes can't be used to make a official diagnosis, there just helpful), and one of them said more specifically that I had Bipolar II disorder. 

I Wikipedia searched this, and it said that some symptoms of it are at least one episode of hypomania, and at least one episode of depression; which I swear I experienced both before. A lot of days I feel like I'm on top of the world (which is basically the definition of hypomania), and on others I feel like absolute crap. I also easily lose interest in things I really like (such as Pokemon Mystery Dungeon) after a few weeks. I even have a weird sex drive for some reason; as in I try to do stuff to get aroused even though I generally don't like being aroused. I heard that these are all symptoms of bipolar disorder.

I also do believe I have an anxiety disorder, though that's off-topic!

I do want to get this checked out, though for some stupid reason when I tell my parents that I think this and think that, they kinda put me off. I've been showing many signs of being autistic since I was three, though I wasn't diagnosed until I was nine when they actually took me to get a diagnosis. 

Anyway, what do you think about this situation? Do you think I'm bipolar? Let me know!",29Nov2019,1

This was only a minor annoyance until it happened today while I was driving and almost got into an accident when I started thinking about something my brother had told me earlier and I almost rear ended the car in front of me going 40 mph but managed to brake in time...

I also always feel the need to apologize for basically everything i feel like i did wrong, even if it's not that big of a deal, and some people get annoyed by it, which makes me stressed also.

34,"So to preface, let me tell you a few things first. I know you all are not doctors and cant diagnose me. Im just scared and want to see if others experience this as well.

My brother died two years ago, and ever since Ive been having nightmares about his death. He died in his sleep due to an OD on sleeping pills unintentionally. This caused me great pain and when I had nightmares, especially about him, I would wake up terrified and not sure what is real.

As it turns out, I have severe OCD. Now I am questioning who I am, what I believe in, do I truly know others, and am I truly safe from the ""bad guys""? I dont have any enemies or anyone that wants to kill me... But I am afraid anyways.

I have also been meditating sometimes for 10 minutes or more a day for the past 2 or 3 months. I have read that meditating can make you more aware of your underlying emotions and thoughts. This has caused me to realize I have A LOT of anger and fear.

I have never taken drugs in my life before my brother died. However my therapist recommended marajuana edibles to help with the PTSD. Ever since I took my first one I have been seeing life in a different light. I question my every behavior, my every decision, and my every thought, my desires, etc. I am scared that I am possibly experiencing a thing called ""ego death"" and/or ""psychosis"". 

Sometimes I seem to lose touch with reality. My nightmares so bad (even when not related to my brother) can cause me to question if this is a dream or not.

I dont know who I am anymore. Im scared Im turning into something bad. Im scared Im going to get hurt or die. But my therapist tells me to be in the present moment. I try at every opportunity. But I dont know what is happening.

Can anyone relate? Sometimes I wake up from my nightmares ""shaken"" as if something PTSD-like has happened",29Nov2019,1

38,"i never really had a good relationship with my mom until i was in 8th grade, living with my emotionally/mentally abusive and neglectful sperm donor. 9th grade rolls around and i moved back in with my mom three days into the start of highschool. 

That year, she helped me with my mental health, and still is. The only thing, my relationship with her has been reverting, slowly, back into how it was before i moved with my SD. 

It hasnt gotten to the cconstant yelling, or threats of fighting, or wishing her death. But i have been avoiding her (and the rest of my family) by hiding in my room more 

But anyways. Thats not the point of any of this. 

I am currently laying on the couch, using her thigh as a pillow. She fell asleep a few minutes ago.

39,"i’ve been dealing with depression for the past few months. and when i first started having suicidal thoughts it was scary to me, i was afraid of myself and i felt as though i couldn’t trust my own brain. but lately, i’ve started to feel a little more at ease. i think numb would be a better word to describe it. i can get out of bed now, and behave almost like i used to, i’m more cynical than usual and very bitter, but i can still act the way i normally do. when i’m alone and not distracted, i go back to feeling depressed. and throughout my day, during normal interactions, i’ll have thoughts of suicide or just quick flashes of different ways i would do it, or daydream about how it would happen. and the thing is, it’s not scary anymore. this is sick, but it’s kind of comforting, and reassuring i guess. i’ll be laughing with a friend and i’ll have a quick flash of myself laying there after i’ve done it. i’ll be eating dinner with my family and have a quick thought about doing it right then and there. and i’ll act completely normal. i don’t know why this is, or if it’s okay. i know it isn’t. i just don’t know what to do about it. any advice would be helpful.",29Nov2019,1

41,"I guess I want to write it on paper so that I know how to express myself if or when I go to a doctor of sorts, and maybe someone else can relate to this? Anyway this is long, so I don’t mind if nobody reads this.
When I was thirteen I started self harming with a nail file. It was on and off for a bit until the end of the school year when I got found out. It was a whole big drama because it was during school and my parents had no idea where I was (I was ditching with friends but lied to them and told them I was under a fucking bridge by myself, don’t know how they bought that crap but hey I took one for the team) and accidentally spilt the beans and told my parents I was incredibly suicidal. They didn’t believe me, at least I still believe the didn’t, but I started having council sessions with a school council, who was fucking trash. 
To get out of the awkward sessions I simply stopped going, and told them that I was feeling fine, which was far from the truth. This caused my parents to believe me even less, even mocking my self harm. Throughout the year, I got progressively worse, though nothing special. 
I lapsed once again into self harm, but I didn’t delve too deep into it, mainly sticking to the nail file but occasionally using a sharp knife. No scars there, nothing to worry about. 
Once it got really bad, however, I tried to reach out again to my parents, whom I had to push strongly to agree to take me to the doctor. There I got diagnosed with depression, and off I went to a proper councillor. I was fourteen by this time, with minimal scarring but my mental state growing worse. I dropped the counselling sessions once they stopped being helpful, which was rather soon because this person wasn’t helpful at all.
When I turned fifteen, I managed to stop self harming and forced myself to focus on something else. Of course this only applies to the cutting I was doing, other self harm I couldn’t control. 
This was when my first “episodes” started to occur, and my extreme moodswings became very common. My episodes consisted of periods of hysteria, in which I became incredibly violent toward myself and others, and it is when I really got into self harm and inflicted deep scars that will be with me forever. I tried to keep these episodes a secret, especially since my parents knew nothing of my self harm and would undoubtedly be incredibly upset if they saw my scars.
I passed through periods of extreme depression, not eating or washing, only getting out of bed under threat of being uncovered. I had periods of extreme energy, in which I became excessively agressive toward conflict and the periods in which I found myself doing every task my depressed self had left undone. 
This went on throughout the year until I had my worst episode, to which my parents were a witness to. I had to confess to everything, but they didn’t do anything, though they were nicer in the things they said. 
So far it’s been around a month since I’ve done any cutting, and it’s been less than a week since I’ve had an episode of hysteria, though I managed with other forms of self harm. My parents don’t know about recent episodes.
Now that we’re finished with that part, we can move onto the next.
I guess this stems directly from the self harm, so here we go. 
As a kid I used to beat up my cat, whether it be throwing it around until it’s nose bled and it was quivering with fear, or whether it just be punching. I don’t know why I did this. I’d always wanted a cat, they are my favourite animal. 
I also have a thing with blood. No, it isn’t a kink, I just very much like seeing it. It’s incredibly satisfying to watch myself bleed from any wound, though my favourite has become cutting. I like the way it soaks my clothes. I don’t know, I just like it. 
I don’t have a desire to hurt anyone (aside from when I’m caught up in one of my episodes, then all bets are off) and I think I’m perfectly normal in all ways, I just have a strange obsession with more extreme mood swings.

There, all on paper.",29Nov2019,1

43,"Hello. My name is Elliot, I’m fourteen years old and I am on here today because I feel like this place would give me answers. I’ve been feeling like blowing my brains out for the the past two weeks. Although for months now it felt as if my mental state had been growing worse and worse as each day went by. My childhood wasn’t the best, and I feel like all the memories are suddenly bubbling to the surface after being suppressed for so long. My thoughts are becoming too loud, to the point where they seem real sometimes. I get weird homicidal thoughts of killing people and hanging them by their necks. I get aroused by thinking about doing horrible things to people. It disgusts me. I don’t like to search up my symptoms because it scares me. I don’t want to be mentally ill.

I'm still struggling with anxiety though and recently I've started encountering something that hasn't happened to me very often, which are panic attacks. It's strange, cause I felt like I've gotten better, but I've had two panic attacks this week. One of them happened this Monday, when I was leaving school, it wasn't too bad, really, I had my friends with me, so I was trying really hard not to cause a scene. 

Another one happened today, just a moment ago. I was on my way to school when I got it and some sweet old lady helped me and escorted me home.

I recently opened up to someone close to me about my issues and past traumas, and feel like I left with a better understanding of why I snap the way I do.

49,"I have never been good at talking about my life. I'm not sure if this is because I never wanted anyone to know, or because it's such a mess in my mind I have not been able to find the right words to say. 

I have had many diagnoses and many therapists. Many pills and many different treatments. Usually what I'll do is something bad will happen and out of desperation I will reach out for help. Things will get good after a few months and I'll drop it all. I've had one really nice therapist understand this and has always taken me back and always will. It doesn't feel right, though, so I don't think  I'll go back this time. The problem is that I don't trust myself at all. I don't trust my reasoning and I certainly don't trust my emotions. My life could go in a good direction, but if I don't get a good perspective, I know it never will. 

I started messing up at a very young age. Some of my earliest memories are of me hurting myself, or at least trying to hurt myself. At 7 I wanted to die, so I tried strangling myself. It goes on and on and now I'm 22 with scars all over my neck, face, and every other part of my body. I can't hide anything even in the winter with a full suit on. It doesn't bother me much any more, but I can't help but wonder what it would be like to have a girl come up to me and genuinely be curious about me, and not ask about my scars. I wonder who I am as a person. 

I don't want to draw this out. And I don't know what I should write. To cut it short, I had a life just like every other mentally sick person, bad home life, bad friends, bad decisions, abuse etc... I hate everyone in my family except my brother and sister. They are wonderful people who were just as damaged as me by our crazy parents. Dad is either schizophrenic or bipolar. Different doctors say different things, and now he lives in the Dominican republic and I haven't spoken to him in 2 years. Mom was diagnosed with bpd just like my sister and I. She is a total headcase and I don't see her much either. I just do my own thing. I feel bad for her. I was a dramatic little shit of a son growing up and did a good job making her feel  bad as a mother. I can be a real piece of shit sometimes. She lashed out on us all the time so I guess that's what I know. I don't want answers like, ""take responsibility"" I know all of that. My best friend tells me I'm good at making messes, but just as good at cleaning them up.

Basically, I was diagnosed with bipolar and bpd. Every doctor has something different to say and some fucking pill to put me on. None of them have done anything before except give me endless side-effects. So many different answers to so many different problems, and at this point I'm just confused as shit and stuck in my own head. I don't sleep or eat and it's taking everything to get rid of intrusive, loud and obnoxious thoughts. I know I need help, but after 10 years or so of nothing changing, I am desperate to try anything new. I just want to be able to see what the hell it is i'm doing from outside my own broken head. I have hurt a lot of people and tossed out amazing opportunities because I tend to go 0-100 in the matter of minutes. I've blown unbelievable amounts of money pursuing a dozen different majors, and all I have to show for it is a ton of electives. As you can probably imagine, it is this way in every aspect of my life, not just college. I don't need the ups and downs and the constant impulsive changes bullshit anymore. It's fucking exhausting.

I'm freaking out really bad. Out of nowhere I'm suddenly super empathetic to everybody else. Out of nowhere I suddenly feel meaningless in my existence. I've read up on what a quarter life crisis is but mine just hasn't seemed to stop. Do I just need to find some distractions to stop me from thinking about this?

I have been trying to get out of a very toxic &amp; dangerous relationship for months now... on top of it I’ve always struggled with major depressive disorder &amp; generalized anxiety disorder &amp; abandonment issues. These things seem to blur my personal boundaries with people &amp; with life in general. I have allowed myself to be treated like dog shit for years now. I am working on loving myself &amp; healing myself. I need to set personal boundaries that I strongly believe in &amp; that are good for me. It blows my mind that people have boundaries &amp; people don’t just say “well I love them so they can treat me however &amp; I will be understanding” 
What are your guy’s personal boundaries you have or want to have? What helps you to distinguish love &amp; just plain being walked all over? What have you implemented in your life to keep yourself afloat?",29Nov2019,1
60,"For the past two weeks I’ve been crying myself to sleep for absolute no reason. I’m geniuses a happy person. I feel loved, I have a good job, uni is okay and in general I don’t necessarily feel sad. Yet at nights, once I turn off the lights and lay down on my bed I feel like crying.

I thought maybe I’m homesick, but I’ve been living alone in the UK for 2 years now so it make no sense for me to suddenly feel homesick. Then I thought maybe I’m lonely cause I have no friends but that’s how I’ve been for the most part of my life. I love being alone and not having friends never really bothered me.
About 2 months ago, I found out my aunt passed away in July. We were once very close but we have kinda lost contact these past few years. I cries about it hard that day and I was fine within days. But for the past two weeks, I feel like crying so I just start to think about my aunt and my late father who passed away 10 years ago.
I dont know if I’m just grieving or trying to  find a reason to cry, if I’m making sense.. Funny thing is, the morning after I find myself laughing at how ridiculous I was the night before for crying.

I really wanna talk to someone but there is only my mum and sister to talk to. I dont wanna talk to my mum cause I know I will just make her worry and she is already going through enough. My sister really likes to talk about her feelings and talk things through but I really hate that. So I dont wanna tell her cause I dont wanna show this vulnerable, pathetic side of me.

I seriously dont know whats wrong with me. I’m even crying while writing this but I bet I’ll laugh about it in the morning. It’s 7am, I need to wake up at 9am yet I’ve been crying for the past 2 hours, unable to sleep. Am I depressed, grieving  or going though some mental breakdown..?

61,"I like people to see me as a combination of weird, mentally ill and dumb. I'm sure i have manic depression and i am naturally a bit weird. I kind of exaggerate my oddness to make people think i could be mentally ill, then maybe wonder what might have happened to me and feel pity. I use it to avoid responsibly and so people will go ""well she's not all there so can't blame her."" Logically i know these things won't usually work as an adult in the real world like it did in my family when i was a child.

But it's all i know. I feel comfortable as that person. I feel good when people think I'm not all there in the head and a weirdo who can't help certain things. I actually get social anxiety when i attempt to act like a fully functioning adult. It feels weird and uncomfortable. Just today some guy in Walmart got annoyed with me walking so close behind him and when he angrily told me to go around i just shrugged and said ""YEAST"" before i walked away. When girls at work act catty towards me i giggle and pretend I'm not picking up on it. When people are mean to me i want everyone watching to judge the other person for being so cruel to someone who seems ""special."" 

When my boyfriends in laws lowkey treated me badly i pretended to be oblivious so that to everyone around saw them as the assholes picking on someone so naive and sweet.

62,"I don’t really have a place where I feel comfortable talking about my problems. Usually when I try opening up to my friends and show vulnerability, I don’t get a sense of empathy or care back. I don’t want to talk to my parents because I don’t want them to worry about me. My mom especially gets judgmental when I seem to be living the way she wishes I wouldn’t. She never really showed empathy when she saw my vulnerability. My dad hasn’t really shown an ability to understand either. Both of them grew up in abusive households, drank, did drugs, and left Poland at a young age without both parents. Once they had me, they cut smoking and drinking cold turkey. Since my birth, I grew up with both parents and soon to have a brother. My parents also converted from Catholic to Christian and claim it saved their life. I agree with them, and am religious as well. 

I’m not gifted with good skin or physique, but I am smart and average looking. My family mocked me for being skinny all through my upbringing but it never bothered me. Around 6th grade was when my friend started to asses me and humiliated me for being skinny, squeezing my wrists and all. I became unhealthily self conscious about my size. I walked the halls with my head down, unhappy, unable to look people in the eye. Anyone could intimidated me. As I joined my first soccer team, weakness and humility surrounded me and spread to every waking moment. I remember feeling my first chronic anxiety surge. It was a summer day and me and my neighbors were out playing with the hoses. For some reason, I felt a tremendous amount of guilt and anxiety about using up my parents water. ”Im wasting it, all my parents hard work, this is going to cost a lot of money, they’ll get mad, I dont...”

I had these manic attacks every time I got the flu. It felt like a video, with the screen focused and tracking the persons face at a very close distance, but the surrounding area around the face felt far away. This, along with shouts that feel loud and elevated, but at a hushed tone, beds feeling like their tilting my feet over my head, feelings in my fingers that I can only describe as a living numbness, terrorized me all throughout my childhood and even now. Scarily, the only things I can fully remember are these episodes. My mom called them hallucinations. Made no big deal of them. My dad, pissed off because he had to clean vomit, missing sleep. My feelings of panic weren’t validated.

I excelled in classes. Though I felt terribly physically, I relentlessly loved learning. Soon, the only thing I had left would succumb to insecurity. I stopped feeling confident in my answers and closed up. I didn’t know how to show emotion. Awkward, shy, anxious, unhappy, I plateaued hard. I stopped caring for soccer, parents forcing me, knowing well I hated it but not caring or wanting to understand why. They told me if I stopped I would get unhealthy and fat. I could only wish at the time. Now it was around 7th grade. 3 full years of low self esteem, inability to communicate, anxious thoughts, hopelessness. 8th grade and freshman year would be the climax, so far. I had no will to do anything. Spending time only either with the same handful of friends or playing Videogames, I isolated myself more and more. I became lonely and far more miserable than I could think I could get. When I thought it couldn’t get worse, I got the worst case of bacne. God even took my torso away from me.


Until the ending of  2018, the absolute juiciest girl from elementary hit me up. With a few new friends in freshman year, my skin clearing, I started to climb up. I never felt a care and desire to make someone else feel happy and cared for until I talked to her. (I was a real duckin simp, and I’m not happy with that reality). But she was the first person I ever opened up about my scars to. And she accepted them. I felt like I mattered for once. It was inexplicable. I exploded with emotion and creativity. I let aside my weights. I was able to make everyone laugh, felt connected to the people around me. But most importantly of all, that girl accepted me. One day in January of 2019, I went full simp and walked through a blizzard to get that bitch some Dunkin duckin donuts. I got her special gifts and an inside joke for Valentine’s Day. When I delivered her gifts, she didn’t invite me inside, but we talked in the front door doorway. She then had a dance at her school and she took me. But I started to have my doubts. She started to almost drift away from me. I was not relationship material, and I didn’t know how to start one, either. It might’ve been my fault. During the dance I switched back to my darkness. I froze up, didn’t know what to say or how to act. That night, when I was in her parents car, on the silent drive to my house, I felt the rope that seemingly tied us together give way. Every time I started to think about her I would scream in my head, smack my head, run around, hyper focus on something else, anything to stop thinking about anything to do with her. I was slipping. Soon I wasn’t really able to be present in reality. I can’t remember the ending of freshman year. I can’t remember anything I did this summer. Hell, I can’t remember what I did today, or any day. I can’t concentrate. My train of thought is like a 60 ton locomotive going 60 miles per hour. I mentally cannot get my brain to stop and think backwards. I’m truly scared. All I can do is be here, and be in the future. But all is not lost. I no longer feel sad, because I don’t know what to be sad about. I’m filled to the brink, and spilling over with anxiety, though. But guess what? I think my brain actually broke. I’m scared. But now, whenever I’m getting those manic attacks after waking up in a cold sweat, I use my double edged sword to hyper focus and distract myself from them. But id much rather be able to appreciate a nice day I had once in a while. 

Now I feel comfortable with myself. Skins still bad, still skinny. But guess what? Fuck anybody who tries to make me feel bad about myself. Screw you too, mom. I don’t want to go to college and get in debt so you can prove to your mom that you’re not a disappointment.

So, please, give your take on my situation. Any recommendations, comments, help, realty checks.

Thanks",29Nov2019,1
63,"Alright, so. I dated this girl that I know isn’t a good person, but she did so much stuff that made me the one to blame that I just need someone to help sort my thoughts out. 

I dated her long distance for three years, on and off, and god I still love her so much. We stopped talking about two months ago, and I’ve been having a breakdown since. 

Thought our relationship there was a power struggle where what she said was what went, and she would fish for compliments, and call me selfish if I ever wanted to talk about myself. I had some mutual friends of hers online that I’m fairly certain were fake accounts since I’d tell them stuff and then she’d just happen to know it, and vice versa. She gaslighted me almost all the time, and towards the end of it she turned things around and started saying I was the abusive one. She said that I was abusive because I kept pushing to date her (she was 19, I was 16, and she would sidestep and never give me a clear answer), and then she told me I was better off with her sibling. Which she then turned around and said I was to stay away from her sibling at all costs after I cracked and started to believe that I really was the nasty person she made me out to be. She blamed me for things I had no part in, and of things I had no memory of ever happening. And I was highly suicidal at the time, my antivax Scientologist mother wouldn’t let me see a therapist for it, and my ex said that I “threw around suicide threats” when like?? She KNEW I was having a hard time, I was open about it, and relied on her when I was having breakdowns. 

She also would tell me about how people on her end of things would invade her personal space and touch her, sometimes even kiss her, and she would just “freeze up,” as described through text. I would (justifiably) get jealous to hear that other people were literally macking on my girlfriend when I was states away and couldn’t do anything about it. 

I know I’m better off not having to deal with her texting me negative things all the time or needing to console her, and I certainly don’t miss how she would get really cold and biting with her word choice. But my stupid brain still misses her and I’m crying as I write this, I want to forget all about her and be able to live my life without her. And I was stupid enough to send her an anonymous message on her tumblr saying that I was sorry. I’m so goddamn stupid, and I hate how much I miss her. It hurts, it physically hurts, and I hate it. 

I don’t know what to do, and I feel fucking crazy and I don’t know what to think. I’m so scared that I really am as bad as she said I was and that I basically ruined her life, and at the same time I’m mad that she fucked me over so badly.

I do have my favourite brands and the fact I'm trying to save up also makes me anxious for this case because these ""save $$$"" marketings.

67,"Hey guys! I'm fairly new to Reddit. Naturally this is one of the first handful of pages I've subscribed to, as mental health advocacy is incredibly important to me. I'm a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, and I was diagnosed with bipolar mood disorder in 2015. In early 2019, I was diagnosed with adult ADHD. I recently began blogging about my mental health journey, as I've found minimal resources lead by people actually affected by mental illness. I had hoped to find an honest, transparent account of what living with severe mental illness was really like, including the particularly ugly side of what we go through on a daily basis. Since I've always had aspirations to be a writer, I decided to fill that void myself. Id like to share my most recent piece, which details my experiences with fluctuating identities and interest. Hopefully this resonates with someone, and I'm always open to feed back, from tone to content. Here is my most recent post, titled ""Having a Mood Disorder Means Living in a Constant State of Identity Crisis."" 



Disclaimer: When I began my journey as a writer (which admittedly wasn’t very long ago), I told myself that the only way I was going to make a difference was by presenting an uncomfortably honest look into what it’s like to live with what is categorized as a severe mental illness. This meant I would have to dig up all the nasty shit, evaluate it, put it into words, and ultimately suffer the consequences of presenting it on the internet for the whole world to see. This particular blog post is likely to be my most vulnerable piece of writing yet, and I’m okay with that. I continue to do this (essentially embarrass myself) for two reasons. Firstly (and most importantly), because I truly believe it’s the only way to advocate for mental illness. I believe humanizing the mentally ill (myself included) is the first step to ending the stigma. Secondly, I do this because I can’t possibly be the only person that experiences these thoughts, feelings, and compulsions. There is a part of me that does what I do, and says the things I say, because I’m ultimately looking for camaraderie. It gets lonely being this crazy sometimes.

When I was diagnosed with bipolar mood disorder in 2015, I immediately delved into research to better understand my behaviors. With self improvement constantly in mind, I have come up with three categories to sort my behaviors under: the stuff I can’t always control (because it’s attributed to my disorder), the things that I can control (because sometimes I’m just a shitty person and I can’t blame my mental illness), and the behaviors and impulses that aren’t specifically addressed in most literature about bipolar disorder, but are more than likely connected to it. I’ve come to understand bipolar mood disorder is a spectrum, and like all spectrums, there are variations in what the diagnosis can look like. This ultimately means that not every stone has yet been unturned. One of the behaviors that aren’t as frequently addressed when discussing the signs and symptoms of bipolar disorder is our constant drive to reinvent ourselves. Personally, I call this my hat collection, because as the saying goes: I’m a (wo)man of many hats.

In the past four or five years, I’ve been a visual artist, writer, podcaster, mental health advocate, owner of at least 3 separate Etsy shops, a tarot reader, a poet, a performance artist, a comedian, a seamstress, a fashion blogger, a hardcore feminist, a libertarian (big yikes), an instagram influencer, a communist, a political activist– the list goes on (and admittedly gets more and more ridiculous). This VERY blog is the product of my constant need for change in identity (I feel obligated to state that this particular endeavor has been especially rewarding and therapeutic, and you don’t have to worry about me falling off the face of the earth). It’s crucial to understand that in the moment of establishing a new identity, I can’t be convinced that I’m anything but an aspiring… whatever. I am fully certain that the role I’m engaged in at the time is my absolute identity. I’m so (temporarily) dedicated to what I’m doing at that moment that I create an entirely new online persona to help promote my message. I have at least 7 e-mail addresses attached to my google homepage at this very moment. 

When I finally bounce back from the manic episode that ultimately fuels this behavior, I’m left feeling defeated and incredibly embarrassed. Not only do I typically not follow through with the endeavor of the week, but I made such a public stink about it, I’m left feeling like I’ve let my friends and family down.

More often than not, it initially hurts my feelings when my friends and loved ones fail to immediately jump on board with whatever I’m trying to be at the time. Everytime I launch a new project or hurriedly rebrand myself in some extravagant way, I expect everyone in my life to be outwardly ecstatic for me. I initially expect shares, reposts, and words of encouragement. There are a select few in my circle that always cheer me on (which I imagine starts to feel quite exhausting), and they know who they are. They’re likely to be the only people I personally know that continue to read this blog (I feel like this a good opportunity to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for your continued support).

I have the unique experience of being on the outskirts of a tight knit group of influencers and creators in the greater Southwest Florida area. When I first arrived in Fort Myers and was adopted into this crowd by way of a feminist collective called Love Your Rebellion, I recieved a high amount of attention and encouragement, specifically as a visual artist, podcaster and contributor to Love Your Rebellion. When I got pregnant, this attention started to shift away in my absence. By the time that I tried to reintroduce myself to the community, not only had the dynamics of the community itself shifted, but my behaviors shifted in the worst way. I had hit a major turning point in my disorder and was frequently manic (and by extension, making very stupid decisions). I became wildly unreliable and difficult to be around. I embarrassed my family. I started drinking pretty heavily to self medicate and lost touch with some very important people in my life (I feel like this is a good opportunity to say I’m sorry and I miss you all).
The behaviors that lead up to this particular period of my life falls under all three categories I described before. Some of my behaviors are not always controllable, because I’m mentally ill. Some of my behaviors were very controllable, but I failed to keep them in check. Ultimately, the tendency to completely ruin your own life is one of those side effects of a severe mood disorder that are typically skipped over by professionals and mental health advocates alike.
Because I never dedicate my time to figuring out the algorithms of a broader exposure, I’ve put a massive burden on the people that continue to stand by my side.

Mood and personality disorders are incredibly messy and they often times overlap one another. Misdiagnosis between bipolar mood disorder and borderline personality disorder is incredibly frequent– more so in women (because our health still isn’t taken seriously by professionals). I have periodically considered the notion that perhaps I was misdiagnosed in the first place, but there are significant differences between the disorders. Bipolar mood disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder share the following traits: extremity in emotion, erratic behaviors, a sense of self importance, and difficulty navigating interpersonal relationships. The major defining difference between the two is that someone with an accurate diagnosis of bipolar disorder will eventually come down from their heightened state (mania), and fall into a depression. Someone with borderline personality disorder struggles daily with their symptoms with very little relief. I don’t typically experience a traditional depressive state, but I do have significant loss of interest and energy to complete whatever I started while I felt that I was on top of the world. This is most likely the root of my inability to commit to any one identity, as well as a pretty debilitating case of imposter syndrome. My self awareness and extreme embarrassment every time this happens is also a symptom of my own form of depressive state.

My constant drive to reinvent myself is fueled by a mania induced sense of impending doom. I suffer a frequent obsessive thought that I’m wasting the little time I have on this planet, and I’m not measuring up to my fullest potential. When I work on a project or new endeavor, and it doesn’t immediately pan out the way I expect it to, I get angry. I’ve recently become aware that I struggle immensely with an inclination towards instant gratification.

Instant gratification is defined as such:  The desire to experience pleasure or fulfillment without delay or deferment. I gotta say, if I could eliminate any symptom of my mood disorder, it would be this one. This is an uncontrollable feeling, but my behaviors surrounding it can be managed with great effort. Allow me to provide an example. About 2 weeks ago (on a Thursday), I dropped my iPhone 7 and shattered the screen beyond repair. I told my partner I needed a new phone, and he assured me that we’d go look at phones that weekend. The cognizant part of my brain told me that I should be incredibly grateful that he immediately agreed to buying me a new phone. The irrational part of my brain told me to smash my phone against a wall so I wouldn’t have to wait 2 days. This was a perfect example of an uncontrollable emotion and a controllable correlating behavior, because I didn’t smash my phone into a wall. I’m fully aware that choosing to not act like a spoiled brat is a silly thing to be proud of, but 6 months ago, I definitely would have done it. This is what progress looks like.

As I dedicate an honest attempt at this whole writing thing, I’m constantly having to remind myself that my past behaviors have driven a lot of my friends away. I’m not sure where the numbers in my readership are coming from, but I can’t imagine that many people I know in my real life are taking me seriously in this new endeavor… and honestly, I have no choice but to be okay with that.

There is always a nagging fear that I’m dead wrong in my declaration that it’s my mental illness that makes me act like a total asshole sometimes. There is always the looming thought that maybe I’m just not a good person. I’ve come to realize that one of my triggers is being told that everyone deals with these emotions, and it’s not attributed to my mental illness at all. I know that people say this in a way that’s meant to help me not feel so alone, as it’s typically said by someone that I know cares about me. The thing is, I hate this part of who I am. I hate that I struggle to see things through and I can’t focus all my energy on any one project. If I could change it, I would. I still haven’t given up on trying to change this behavior. I have to come to terms with the fact that my constant hat switches has to be exhausting for the people that want to continue to support me. I have to fully accept that this is a pseudo “boy who cried wolf” situation, and I risk the misfortune of losing my support system entirely. I’ve already seen the beginning signs of that happening.

This is what bipolar mood disorder (and all mood and personality disorders on the spectrum) looks like. It’s difficult to expect people to fully comprehend and accept the honest to God truth of what my disorder persuades me to do on one hand, and (on the other hand) constantly struggle to hold myself accountable. If only one factor of this post sticks with you, I hope it’s the understanding that we, as the mentally ill, can be aware of the damage we cause ourselves and others, whether that be by constantly reinventing ourselves, or some other distressing symptom of our disorders. We honestly can’t always control the drive behind our behavior, but we’re capable of recognizing where we can improve for the betterment of our support circle, and most importantly, ourselves. Because of this, I think it’s direly important to hold us accountable for our actions, even though that doesn’t feel very good for us to acknowledge.

This blog is being written not only for the mentally ill, but for the people that haven’t given up on supporting us. Please understand that there is, often times, a huge part of our psyche that tells us to find identity in something besides our mental illness. We live in a society that either demonizes us, or categorizes us as incredibly gifted. At least personally, this drives me to justify my constant creation and abandonment of new endeavors by believing and perpetuating the idea that I am gifted, and should explore all avenues of creativity. This is going to push us to try new things, and in an effort to distance ourselves from our diagnosis, we (okay, maybe it’s just me) push for a rebranding of our very selves. Hold us accountable by checking in on where we’re at mentally, but be gentle. As I’ve mentioned before (and frequently in this particular thought piece), we can’t control what our disorders tell us to do, but we have the capability to strive towards bettering ourselves and holding ourselves responsible against the behaviors that we feel compelled to act on. Ultimately, this is one of the lesser discussed side effects of living with a mood or personality disorder, and when we come to acknowledge how silly we’re acting, it causes us a great deal of depression and self doubt. I feel it’s pertinent to the ending of the stigma against the mentally ill to understand why we exhibit behaviors that are easily perceived to be obnoxious. If you love someone that struggles with a constant ebb and flow in self identity, the best thing you can do is provide us with the space to work through the kinks, and be there to discuss the aftermath. If you struggle with frequent identity crisis, I hope you come to understand that you’re not alone, and eventually you will find the right fit to move your identity past your diagnosis. As always, you are valid.",29Nov2019,1

I'm 22 and I'm at the point in my life where I have accepted that I need professional help. I am graduating college next week and my brain is a complete mess in regard to my future. My mind races at night but I cannot shut it off and my sleep schedule is screwed.

I went to therapy in middle school and it wasn't a great experience. They just pressured me to take medication for my problems and let me beat them at chess while talking about what's bothering me. But I feel like there has to be a way to talk through what's going on without resorting to some happy pill.

As far as medication goes, I'm most afraid of what side effects it may give me. I dont want to turn into some zombie who relies on medication to have a decent day. Also if I run out of meds, would there be some sort of withdrawal symptoms? It all seems scary to me and I guess I want to hear some opinions on therapy and medication for mental illnesses, specifically depression and anxiety.

It has gotten to the point that my boss stopped giving me work to do and now has reduced my hours to 5 a week. I cannot pay my bills with this kind of pay and I now have to find a new part time job which I am finding very difficult to find due to my student hours availabilities.

83,"I’ve struggled with my mental health ever since I was a teenager and I am now 30. At first I mainly struggled with depression and self harm. During my early 20s I struggled with depression, social anxiety and substance abuse. I was first hospitalized in my early 20s and I thought misdiagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I had several more hospitalizations in my early 20s until I eventually was I believe properly diagnosed with bipolar type 2 and finally put on medication that worked for me.

I spent most of the rest of my 20s living a more manageable but more solitary life because I was never able to really get over my social anxiety and my idea of how society perceives me. Lately though it’s almost like my social anxiety is non existent. At first I thought I might be going into a hypomanic state but the longer it has lasted and the more I read up about borderline personality disorder in people as they age I am starting to think I may have had or have bipolar type 2 and borderline personality disorder. I feel like I am finally starting to care less and less about what people think and perceive about me (which is common in borderline personality disorder) and I am finally comfortable in my own skin.

I won’t go into details on the affair, but I stupidly developed an infatuation with a woman that went too far. I’m now days away from being officially divorced and it goes without saying my ex wife hates my very being. Myself and this other woman are still together, but the obsession is gone; I’m back to just being complacent.

What is really bothering me is that I just can’t fucking get upset about it. I feel incredibly guilty when I think about the position I’ve put my ex in - we’ve had to sell our home that we worked so hard for; she’s now surviving on her income that was always the lesser of the two; she’s been sleeping on her parents floor for months. 

But despite the guilt - despite seeing her around town looking unhappy - I cannot fucking vent. I feel like I need to cry and let it all out, but it just won’t come. Even after 10 bloody years.

Diagnosed BP2. 

I’ve been through so many meds that didn’t work and made me feel worse from weight gain.

Finally found meds that don’t cause weight gain and make me feel relatively flat with mostly lows and no highs. 

I’m on lamotrigine 300mg daily, duloxetine 120mg daily, amitriptyline 10mg daily (which was a new addition as my mood is still low a lot of the time)

Does this sound like too much? I don’t have many major side effects, but I sometimes worry that I could suddenly get a spike into mania. That happened before, but that was a result of venlafaxine which they stopped immediately.

I’ve been through the rounds with many MANY types of meds for the past 10+ years.

115,"I don’t even know where to begin with this, I guess I can start with some info about myself. I’m M, late 20s, Brit living abroad in Hong Kong. My mind is just a mess sometimes and in some ways it always has been. This is going to be really unstructured as there’s too much to really organise my thoughts on so I apologise in advance to readers.

I’ve always felt like my life has no purpose whatsoever. When I look at my peers around me of my generation I can see they’ve all found their callings in life and know what they want to do but I’m the only one who is still undecided. I’ve been doing entry-level TEFL for a few years now ever since I got out of university in a completely unrelated field and got an awful grade on my degree because I just wanted to get out of there, I’d had enough by then. I enjoy my job of being in the classroom teaching but it doesn’t give me any overwhelming sense of fulfilment to make me think that this is my calling in life.

When I think about what I want to do it’s never the same as other people. Everyone seems to be into some kind of sport or is a musician or has some kind of intellectual hobby but I don’t have any of that. I have no real skills, no talents, nothing marketable to anyone. When I think about what I want to do, I don’t want to do much, I kind of just want to chill but pretty much all the time. I usually like playing video games and watching spooky conspiracy/paranormal shit on YouTube (I don’t take it seriously, I just find it entertaining).

When I first moved abroad I went through a honeymoon period for the first two years as it was a totally new place, I got a local partner which opened up a lot of new doors but once I settled in to this place it just became normality to me, yet it’s still distinctly different from my home and I always miss HK eventually when I stay at home for long periods of time.

The recent troubles in HK have certainly done a number on my mental health. When it all first started it was very easy to bury my head in the sand but after certain incidents occurred I just became so angry and got caught up in the constant news updates, discussion groups and live-streams. I couldn’t pull myself away and eventually found myself going out to attend illegal protests, assist people in vandalising pro-CCP shops and spray painting pro-democracy graffiti in my local area. I needed to do these things as a kind of outlet, I know it’s pretty dangerous but I was just so angry that I didn’t care if I got arrested or attacked. Nothing has ever made me feel like that before. I find that I couldn’t even do the regular things I enjoyed like playing video games or watching YouTube, I tried a couple times to do these things but it just didn’t feel right at all knowing everything that was happening outside.

The obvious solution here is to leave HK, at least temporarily until shit cools down, but that’s easier said than done. Even just without me missing the city in general, I still have my local partner here with whom, before the protests happened, we had been making plans to get a mortgage on a new flat and move in together next year. Nothing has changed with that plan but with the violence escalating as much as it has done, and likely could do again, it really puts into question the long term viability of HK as a place to put down roots as if it wasn’t already questionable with 2047 looming ever closer (expiry date on HK’s autonomy from China).

I love my partner a lot but they’re a bit naive. They refuse to leave HK even if the army came in to massacre people Tiananmen-style and they assume that HK really will stay the same until 2047 which I think anyone can see is not going to be the case with the way things are going. I don’t know how sincere they are about this insistence to stay, I’ve made it clear we can get married and get them citizenship in my home country if we need to escape to safety but it seems I can’t really make them budge much on this right now. Due to my partner’s culture, they also don’t understand mental health very well so I find it really difficult to talk about my problems with them although I find it very difficult to talk about in general anyway. I feel like things will get to the stage that I will be forced to make a heartbreaking decision to leave HK out of concern for my own personal safety and be forced to leave her behind in the chaos.

Another major issue in my life is that I’m addicted to weed. I know you can’t get a physical addiction to cannabis like you can with nicotine, alcohol or heroin but I still have an extremely difficult habit to kick with it and it’s actually ruining my finances because I’m paying for it with cash I take out of my credit card account. I know, it’s bad. Cannabis is very expensive in HK but whenever I don’t have it, I can’t explain it but it’s like the thought of getting more just takes root in my mind and no matter how hard I resist, if it’s hours or days, I eventually cave in. And I smoke so much of it that it does nothing for me, I just smoke it to feel “normal” now. I don’t want to reach out to any official kind of addiction group or rehab clinic or anything like that because I don’t want anyone knowing what a severe problem I have, it could affect my employment and lead to negative judgment on me, especially in this society.

I can’t be fully honest with my family as they’ll be horrified that I’ve gotten directly involved in illegal protest activities here, I can’t really talk to my partner as they won’t really understand where I’m coming from, my friends are good but I just don’t feel like I could talk to them or anyone for that matter about what really goes on in the deepest darkest parts of my head, even what I’m posting here is just the tip of the iceberg. Everyone around me is well intentioned and cares about me in their own way but I just have too much shit going on in my head that I alone find difficult to comprehend and put together, never mind asking someone else to help. The few times I have tried to talk about issues, I feel like I just get generic advice about “positive thinking” but I find positive thinking to be very difficult when faced with an objectively grim world with a grim outlook and then also looking at my own life which honestly I think is just a bit pathetic in comparison to what my peers are doing.

Whenever I try to really think about my issues, I get lost in the endless strands of thought and always just fall back to letting it all continue and trying to just ignore/live with it. I don’t know what to do.

119,"I've gotten to the point where I want to kill myself. So much so that I can feel physical tingling in my whole body.

I want to kill myself or tie up my spouse and murder her 

I'm having intrusive thoughts. I keep thinking I should eat the filth around the toilet, shower and sink. 

I can't trust my family. My wife doesn't keep her promises. Obviously she had a lot of issues too otherwise she would have left me fifteen years ago.

I don't keep friends. I don't know why. I just can't socialize. Like even the incels and racists will congregate. I just can't. Yes I'm filled with bitterness and anger but I'm still alone with it. I don't know what that means exactly.

I don't WANT to hurt people. I'm sorry if that is a contradiction. I don't celebrate violence.


I'm taking my meds but I'm really close to losing it.

I have a legit diagnosis of a TBI. I feel like that ruins everything. Meds and therapy will work... Unless you have a TBI. If the brain is damaged, you can't expect it to respond predictably. 

Every day is a gamble. 

Yeah the holidays are hard but this has been going on since LAST Thanksgiving.

Or comically longer. 

I wanted to kill myself since I was six. My whole life had been suffering with feeling alone. Like really painful isolation. 

That's how I got a TBI. I was being foolish because what difference would it make if I died? But the universe has a sense of humor. You know what is worse than death? Being disabled from a young age. 

Anyway. I've resolved to go back to therapy. I haven't been in a few years.

I’m on a wait list to be tested for ADHD. I also tried seeing a counsellor, but I felt very uncomfortable and she couldn’t do anything because she was a PhD student. My anxiety has been really bad, and I can’t seem to find a doctor that I trust and feel comfortable with.

123,"I'm at a point where I don't know what to do. I had a psychiatrist a couple months ago that I hated and still do but the thing that sealed my feelings towards him was when he sent me to a residential facility knowing that the place was a living hell. I met him when I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt I was in the hospital for over a month and when they couldn't ""help"" me they decided to ship me off somewhere else. I was scared because I heard of a terrible place that not even child molester should go to but he assured me that he will choose only a good one. Fast forward a week later he sent me to the place of nightmares the place I would have rather burned myself alive than go to. I begged him not to send me there but he wouldn't listen he just kept saying it was out of his control which was complete bullshit because he's the only one who had the power to send me there. Well I ended up being transported there having no choice vxx e in the matter. Fast forward I end up getting released about 2 and a half months later but as you can guess I was worse than when I went in so 3 days later I tried to kill myself and ended up back at the first hospital I went to, I ended up having the same doctor and that's when I told him everything about that place. He then said ""I know but I had to send you somewhere"". I told him to never send another person there, 3 days later he sent another girl to that same facility. When I was at that hell hole I dreamt of killing him every night and when he confessed to knowing how terrible it was there but not caring my urge to kill him grew stronger. I thought is he worth going to prison for but then I remember the pain, anger, fear, sorrow and hopelessness I felt there and remember other teens will experience the same thing if someone doesn't stop him. So yeah if I save others from being sent there by him then yeah it's worth it. I know his work schedule, where he most likely lives, how old he is, Hell I even know his political party. I would make him confess everything to get that place shut down or find a way to ""shut it down"" myself. But I can't even tell you exactly how I would kill him I dream of doing it so many different ways. What do I do?

128,"The following quoted text is a Quora user's response to the question **My boyfriend has severe depression and anxiety, dropped out of high school and doesn’t think he’ll ever be able to live normally. Is there anyway I can help him?** I'll follow-up at the end with my thoughts and questions for you guys.

&amp;#x200B;

*""You need to leave him. Not only for your own sake, but for his. I know in highschool you think he's the love of your life, and the best thing in the world but here is the reality. He's not. Even if he pulls out of his depression, and finishes highschool and goes on to do amazing things, the likelihood of you two being together into mid adulthood is extremely low. What isn't extremely unlikely, is him turning into an addict, suicidal, or a shutaway. As a young lady, you may feel sensitivity towards his baggage. You may fall in love with the idea of making him better. This is dangerous.*

*The worst thing a person battling depression can do, is drop their responsibilities and sit inside.*

*Winners will exercise, eat right and climb out of the agonizing apathy one day at a time.*

*Losers will shut themselves in and play video games or watch television all day.*

*Furthermore, is this the behavior of a suitable mate? Will his depression come back when you have children to finance? If you get sick and are in poor health will his depression arise? Will he drop out of the workforce and lose everything while you or someone he loves needs support the most?*

*I know this answer will get poor publicity, because we are supposed to act like depression is something that needs constant nurturing and care. But it's not. The only way out of depression is to pick yourself up and elevate yourself into a position in life that doesn't make you miserable.""*

&amp;#x200B;

Whew, so this is a lot to unpack. I'll skip the personal information regarding the asker, and get into the answerer's opinions on isolation and other maladaptive coping mechanisms.

Firstly, my main gripe is his use of the word ""loser"". I don't necessarily think this comes from malice, but it is contemptuous and dangerous as all hell. One of the hallmarks of depression is self-blame, and it's easy to see yourself as lazy trash when you struggle to perform the most basic of tasks (holding down a job, having a social circle, or even basic hygiene). Not because of entitlement or lack of work ethic, mind you. This is coming from someone who follows much of the answerers advice (i.e. eating right, exercising, etc.) but the fog persists.

I also abhor the assumption that anyone suffering from severe depression refuses to take steps towards improvement. I (and many of you, I'm sure) have made attempts at finding work, making friends, and enriching our lives. The problem is, the perpetual brain-fog and self-doubt always get in the way, sabotaging us and making everything seem hopeless. This does nothing for self-image. It's at a point where I can't leave the house due to knowing that most people write you off based on an unkempt appearance or rusty social skills. The former of which is difficult to maintain with this condition, and the latter hard to learn.

To wrap things up, on a constructive note, I'll get to my point. I'm wondering what one should do when they've reached rock-bottom. Obviously therapy is a must (both one-on-one and groups), and I plan on enrolling when I move in the upcoming month. I've done one-on-one before, but something is still missing. Making friends is a strong desire, but as others in this sub have expressed, it's easy to be tossed to the wayside by people who just view your disposition as negativity. I don't push my problems on others, or even talk about them, but I'm still told it's hard to be around me because of my low mood and dullness. It hurts me deeply.

How do I finish the puzzle? At this point, I constantly grapple with the idea that I'm ""less than"" or ""lazy"". What. Do. I. Do?",29Nov2019,1

132,"So, I am a 17 year old from the American South East. I lived a mostly normal life, in poverty, but rarely ever got super hungry and always had a house over my head, but that really isn't the thing. Around 10, I always felt.. strange, as if I'm not 'normal', as if I am different from everyone else, and not positively either. Everyone around me, even the more awkward people, seem to at least find someone to have that special connection with, someone that they can depend on. Me? I don't. And, I kind of like it that way, even if it seems self-destructive (nothing suicidal, mostly just slamming my hand into my head in frustration or anger). I do have rampant depression, but it's like I can self-contain it. I cry, and I feel better. But, things start to kick off when I am not alone, when there is people around me. Fear and dread rushes over me, I feel sick. I am genuinely afraid of school, not because of the stress of school work, but because there is people there. I just like total isolation, I can't really speak to anyone personally because I stumble on my words and sound like a complete idiot, so if I have something to say, I say it over text. What do I do in my free time? Well, besides playing games, being on discord, or just sleeping. I mostly just grab my headphones, go outside, and listen to music as I pace around, thinking to myself.

Add on top of that, when it comes to any kind of intimacy, i **act** like I don't care for it, but I secretly want someone to love, badly. I've been in a very few relationships, they didn't last for very long, but the last one sticks out to me. This was around 2 or 3 years ago, me and this girl spoke for months, and I finally managed to gain the courage to ask her out (Which is honestly strange for me to do so, I never have the courage to, but then again, I did ask her out over text). She said yes, I was happy. But as the relationship progresses, anxiety took control of my life,  I felt like I was being too needy or clingy, so I created this persona of sorts, someone who wasn't truly me, and she noticed it. The relationship was strained from the beginning, but meh. Anyway, she broke up with me, which broke my heart. A few weeks afterwards, she started to date someone else, after I heard that, I developed a sadistic and vengeful imagination where I am in control of everything. They died off, mostly.. Me and her boyfriend are cool now, thankfully, he actually helped me out when I vented to him about something unrelated. Anyway, that's all I have to say now. I'm free to answer questions if any are asked, not like I have nothing else to do. My mom is looking to get my a therapist or counselor or whatever. I don't know how I feel about that tbh.",29Nov2019,1

135,"Sorry in advance, I just feel lonely and need to vent.

Depression is difficult, sure. But what's worse is when you're on antidepressants, trying to get into therapy, picking up all the broken pieces; finally feeling the negativity clearing slowly-- laughing, like actually laughing with friends not just anxiously. Feeling good about the future, feeling confident for the first time in forever... Just to have all of it crumble in front of you, everything you've been piecing together just uncontrollably being torn apart in front of you. But this isn't about me, it's about my sister. It seems that we are both identical, yet the sun and the moon, literally -- in our interests and preferences. But also, whenever I'm doing well, she seems to be struggling. 

My twin sister has been sectioned, and she's not well... we think schizophrenia or psychosis. She's unrecognisable, I had to make the call (twice in three days) - they sent her home the first time, told us she's fine, and only a day later I had to do it all again. The dialling, the waiting, the crying, the telling all the details. She's in the hospital now, has been for the last 4 days, it's not looking good. This is also the longest we've been apart. I miss her, she's more than an hour away. I called her today... she asked me where I was and something completely irrelevant, told me she missed me and hanged up after 2 minutes. It's painful. I'm hurt. I've cleaned our room -- washed her bedsheets and clothes, threw away all the wrappers and rubbish. I feel lonely, I feel trapped, what else can I do?  I know she's getting help but I can't help remembering all our memories and part of me is positivity and happiness, thinking about the many more to come. But part of me is darkness and hopelessness, the side that seems to always win. She's going to be away for at least a month they say... and I always say Christmas gets worse every year, but this year is definitely worse of all. And it's not the growing up or the realising Father Christmas isn't real this time. It's the loneliness, the pain.

144,"I've been having panic and anxiety attacks daily since I was 14.  I'm 36 years old now.  As of December 1st, I will be 6 months panic and anxiety attack free.  It's all still very surreal to me.  I couldn't imagine going a week without one, and now I'm at nearly 6 months.  

As for how this has happened, I think it's due largely in part by finally being properly diagnosed with ADHD.  My currently therapist suspected it, so with lots of questions and some tests, she diagnosed me.  Treatment was changed, I was given some resources, and applied a lot of what she advised.  So much of my life makes sense, especially school and why I didn't do so well.  

My mother still refuses to believe I have ADHD.  ""Girls can't get ADHD, and adults can't get it.""  I've provided her with information regarding this, but to no avail.  My father won't even acknowledge it.  Thankfully both my sisters support me, and one of them has children; she's done research and will be keeping an eye out for ADHD in both her son and daughter.  

My husband was diagnosed with ADHD as child, has suspected me having it since we met 15 years ago, but said nothing.  Now he's helping me as well, using methods and techniques that work for him.  I make jewelry and have made a necklace I can use as a fidget toy.  Much better than tapping a pen on the table, doodling, shaking my leg, and a variety of other coping mechanisms I had no idea were a thing with ADHD.  Now I have better focus when talking and listening.  I understand now that a lot of my panic and anxiety attacks are triggered by over-stimulation, which I'm very sensitive too.  I understand now that strong periods of depression are due to a lack of stimulation, and I've set aside projects for those days where things are particularly dark.

146,"I take buspar, 10mg in the morning and 10mg at night. I’ve been taking it this way for months, but I guess I’m supposed to be taking 5mg in the morning and 10mg at night. So I made an appointment with my doctor for December 11th to discuss upping it to match how I have been taking it. 
The issue is my pharmacy has me taking 5mg in the morning and 5mg at night. These are all 5mg pills, so essentially my pharmacy shorted me 90 pills. Part of this is my fault because I’ve been taking 10mg in the morning, but still, 90 pills is a lot.
So now I’m out of medicine. The doctors office says they can’t do anything until my doctor approves the 10mg in the morning 10mg at night thing in December. But they won’t even send over a script for the 90 I’m missing. That would get me through until I see her. I did an experiment a couple months ago and stopped taking my meds for two days and my anxiety was absolutely unbearable after the second day, so I’m freaking out about this. 
I’m looking into take HTP-5 until December because I read that’s similar to buspar. Do you think trying to get in to see a different doctor would help? I’m afraid if I go to a different doctor other than my family doctor I will come off as ‘drug seeking’. I just feel like this doctor isn’t helping me.

I told her I just needed something PRN, like 5 pills a month for the attacks which are totally ruining my life, and she said they don’t really prescribe that stuff (I’m assuming benzodiazepines?) but upping my buspar isn’t going to help and I’m happy with the amount I’m taking now, it’s serving it’s purpose in treating my anxiety and depression, I don’t want to take more every day. I’m going to tell her again in December but I feel like a psychiatrist should be doing this stuff if it’s dealing with my mental health and medications?

149,"(Sorry it’s lengthy but I needed to get it all out) Hey reddit, While I’m not new to the app I’ve never really posted anything, more so just usually scrolling and reading, but I have a situation I’m in great need of help in. My mom passed about 3 years ago and while it was harder back then, I’ve been able to cope with it. During the time I cried, a lot and sometimes even thought about taking my life, but now I see what there is to offer. A year after her passing I just didn’t care, I couldn’t take care of my hair, I went through a phase where I didn’t really care about style too much (which CURRENTLY is very important to me, and makes me feel good), grades were terrible and honestly thought I wouldn’t make it. Here I am now though, got that all worked out, styling out, grades are not perfect As, but I haven’t failed anything and don’t plan to go below any Cs. However the one thing that came of this is extreme over thinking. No matter WHAT the situation is, I think negatively, and if I see someone doing something bad I think ILL become like them. For example, I do Muay Thai, and there was this kid that was genetically unathletic, and while blessed given the gift of being able to preform well and improve, j always feared of being like this kid, and I would think about it day and night and stress myself out. Sometimes I think I’m ugly, (definitely not a 10, but compared to some I’m very blessed and thankful for my looks) sometimes I stress and over worry about a situation that could ^EASILY^ be solved if I could calm down and work it out. Sometimes I worry about being violent to people, and have mental images that have made me cry before. Sometimes I worry about one of my sisters or father being hurt and it makes me paranoid over simple stuff, like my dad doesn’t come home for an hour after he usually gets there, and doesn’t answer my text, and I start making situations up in my head. Music is definitely a good coping mechanism, and I love many types. Being a young black boy with a dad over 50 I grew up listening to oldies like, Gladys Knight and the pips, con funk shun, Earth Wind and Fire, kool and the gang, etc. as well as 90s r&amp;b, and started developing a taste for rap music, reggae, Lofi and a few others. But this doesn’t work all the time, and I feel like even doing things I enjoy sometimes the thoughts come back. If I’m playing video games or something, I might mess up an attack or something and then my brain goes into this loop messing me up and all I’ll think about is doing that ONE attack, and not being able to do it until I can calm down. Someone, any tips? PLEASE tell me if any of you have this exact problem, while I know it exists, I feel like I’m the only one sometimes. Thank you, I know it’s long.",29Nov2019,1
150,"For the past 4 years I've had a big problem that's affected my life quite a lot. I can't talk to people older than me. I will simply break down and cry. I don't want to cry in most cases but I can't control it. Because of this I've slowly shut down from my parents, I never tell them how I feel anymore. I've started to break down in front of teachers

I've tried telling my parents about this but everytime they've either dismissed it as hormones or just said that the only way to make me stop is by pushing me to my limits until I stop. It hasn't helped me at all.

I hate it it makes me feel frustrated with myself making it worst. I hate the fact that I can't explain it and that everyone, no matter how much I say I'm fine, will keep trying to tell me it'll be OK.

I don't know what caused it may be my old teacher who humiliated me and talk me down so many times, or it may be my grandad, who at the time I lived with him, still drank a lot of alcohol, his temper was short and he would often snap at me over nothing.

Whatever this is I hate it and I need help with how to stop it",29Nov2019,1
151,"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

I dont know what is wrong with me, everything is going great in my life. I just got engaged to my fiance who I love to death. She has been the best thing in my life. We lived together for a year and then 3 weeks ago purchased a new house and moved in. I proposed to her on the day we took possession of our house in our beautiful back yard that looks over the water. Everything is great, but for some reason since we moved in I started getting really anxious. I am very irritable and grumpy most of the time. I dont know why, I cant stop it. My fiance will say things that maybe i disagree with or have a different opinion and I snap at her and become a real jerk. I say things I shouldnt. I dont know why I am feeling like this, I really should be so happy right now but I am not. Anyone have any insight into this?",29Nov2019,1
152,"Hey, I have Asperger's, which I guess I should point out before I begin.
So, I get upset at stupid things. All my life I've been getting upset at stupid things.
By stupid things, I mean in a movie something that's supposed to be funny involving something like a kids toy breaking. It's meant to be funny but I get extremely upset. I watched the banana splits horror movie recently, and there's a certain scene that made me break down for some reason. It was when the camera showed people in the audience, a young girl was clearly bored and unenthusiastic, which already made me upset due to the kids show theme. But what made me even more upset was the father, who was pointing and smiling at the guys on show, enthusiastically trying to make his daughter laugh. I don't know why but I started crying and it just ruined the movie for me.

Several movies have been ruined for me just because of stuff like this. I know its stupid but it's translating into real life situations.",29Nov2019,1
153,"Hey all, the main point of this post is to really just get your guys feedback on how to better my life. (20m) here, and i've been dealing with pretty constant anxiety/depression for about 3 years now. And honestly i think i have a terrible perspective on my own mental health, because i view it all as just ""its me, there no need to change it"" which is a bad mentality to have. Long story short, my anxiety was first sparked my freshman year of college, i was arrested and had 3 charges hanging over my head while i was 4+ hours from home. All misdemeanors, alcohol and drug related (the dreaded devils lettuce strikes again). And ever since then, it seems that my anxiety is at a constant 110%, all of my thoughts are pretty much anxiety filled. As well as my depressions being much more extreme, IE: not leaving the house for days, skipping work, school, etc. I gave therapy a try about 6 months back, it seemed to help a bit. But really all i used it for was to go in and complain about the shitty parts of my life, relationship problems, etc. After about 4 months of therapy, me and my therapist concluded that everything that i've been complaining about turned out to be false, and that it was just me thinking the worst of every single situation, and that really took my confidence away, as i sat there and thought ""wow i've been paying all this money for literally 0 results"" so after that session i never went back. I would rather not turn to prescription drugs at this point, i just don't want to be a legal addict until im 50 years old. 

What made me write this post was a very recent panic attack i had, where i had convinced myself i smoked laced weed and that i was having a heart attack. Went as far as calling my mother and telling her i was dying, but luckily she talked me off the ledge. So if anyone has any advice on how to handle this shit on my own, since that's really what i've done my whole life i don't see why i can't apply that here. I'm very interested in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, but i've found it extremely difficult to change my thoughts-since literally every thought i have is an anxious one. After being quite introspective on my life/relationships i've come to the conclusion that my anxiety has ruined my past two relationships. Whether that be due to my constant reassurance questions like ""do you still like me?"" or ""are you cheating on me?"" or whether its just my anxious attachment style doing its thing. 

Any advice would be great, this is really the last option until i bite the bullet and see a Psychiatrist for an SSRI or something along those lines. And i'd like to stay as far from that as possible. 

Thanks guys, have a good night/day.",29Nov2019,1

156,"The last two weeks in Sweden, A 17 year old swedish girl went missing 50km from my home. Her 22 year old kurdish boyfriend was arrested and was not about to tell them where to find her. After two weeks they have finally found some remains of her body and according to the police it confirms that she has been murdered. They are yet to find the rest of the body parts.

I have been following this case since day one and lately i have been feeling a little bit sad about it but also furious, frustrated and angry. I have some weird feelings coming up from this and when i heard today that remains of her body had been found i did not feel too well. She is my age and the thought of an innocent girl being treated like this not just on this planet but in Sweden makes me feel hopelessness.

I just wanted to share this with you and maybe start a discussion because i rarely feel depressed or sad but these last few weeks has been very strange for me. Does it take a toll on people's mind to constantly be engaged in cases like this and how do police officers deal with this?",29Nov2019,1
