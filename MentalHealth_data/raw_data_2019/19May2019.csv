0,I'm 23 years old and lost my best friend to suicide 7 months ago. I'm finding it very hard to cope and I have relapse with SH and cant seem to stop im so low in mood. I have no friend or anyone I can talk to or just meet up to cry or talk. Why am I so fucked up in the head. Why do people hate me or just use me all of the time. I'm truly lost with this life. I just want it to be done. So how i kmow people dont like me why??? Why am I so bad?? I hate borderline personality disorder and wish i never got the tag in one fucked up person.,19May2019,2
1,"i'm in one of the drops right now, so i guess i can explain it better. what i call 'drops' is basically just a mood swing, where i go really happy to really sad really quickly. i've already been diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression, with bipolar mixed in. i take zoloft as well. anyways back to the drops, which i'm currently in right now.
they kind of start out of nowhere like most mood swings do. 
i just feel empty and numb, almost ticklish throughout my body.
i have no motivation to move, or to get any better. 
i feel like i could lay in bed and rot, no one would care anyways. 
i feel like i want to cut, i can't move to get any razors. besides, it's just disappoint everyone close to me even more.
i don't even want to kill myself. i just want to do nothing. sometimes cry, maybe it'll spiral into a panic attack, but right now i can't even cry.
i just feel nothing.
these drops happen everyday, from three to twenty times a day.
i'm sure it's making the people close to me get tired of me, it's very easy to.
i feel the need to drive everyone away so they don't have to see me anymore. but i truly don't want to die.
i'm sure i'll snap out of this drop soon. but for now, i am nothing.",19May2019,1
2,"I’m horrible at everything I do. I can’t cook, can’t program, I can’t draw, I can’t sew, I can’t sing, I can’t write, I can’t do any math, name anything in this world and I guarantee you I’m not good at it. I haven’t been through any trauma either, most people who are sad and demotivated have reasons. I have nothing. My life has been filled with happiness and sure I’ve had some hard times but nothing that would make me this angry at myself. I’ve been bullied and my dad did leave for 7 years but that doesn’t bother me anymore. I’m just awful, I have a home, food, clothing and shelter and here I am, stupid and horrible. I’m a creepy idiot stalker who falls in love too easy and has my heart broken because of it. I’m insane, I really am. All I want to do is run away and lay in a meadow until I die of hunger. I don’t even have any mental illness. My therapist and psychiatrist says I might have BPD (said that in another post) but I don’t agree. I was diagnosed with MODERATE anxiety last summer and was given pills. The past few months no anxiety whatsoever. I skipped taking my pills cause I don’t need them as they insist I still do, I DON’T! I have no mental illness I’m just naturally this screwed up! I tell my therapist over and over that I’m good at nothing but shes says “you are just choosing to not acknowledge what your good at” NO NO NO NO! I Am just not good at anything and I deserve to be shot! I have no motivation or energy to get better either. My mental health is so god awful. My mental image of myself changes like every 10 minutes.  I’ll probably say I’m the perfect human in a few minutes and regret this post but I know that’s not true. I suck. That is all. I really wish there was someone out there like me but there is not. If you have nothing you are good at, don’t go to school, and are just stupid and lazy just message me or something I don’t know. It’d be reassuring knowing I’m not alone.",19May2019,0
3,"For over 10 years, I've been hit, punched, choked, really any sort of violence often from my brother. Right now it hurts to move my eyebrow as he punched me in the head, and my ribs hurt because he stepped on me. I feel frightned when he walks by and hope that he won't come in and hit me. I tried to tell my mom he's always hurting me a few years back when I was like 9ish and she just said ""No he doesn't."" So I've just stopped talking. One time he waited for the lights to go out when we were playing hide n seek with cousins and I guess I was annoying him so he grabbed my wrist roughly and it scratched enough to leave a scar now a year later, and choked me for a few seconds and stopped the seconds the lights went back on. At the rate it's going, I think I might end up killing myself or him. It wasn't every night like it used to be, but it's still often and he rarely apologizes. I want to escape so bad. What can I do?",19May2019,3
4,"I have a lot of problems. It's hard to cover them all but let's give it a go. I have this thing were no matter what seems to happen, if it's out of this little bubble of staying in the house, not leaving to go to school, not talking to people it's fine. But the second it breaks free from that I'll begin feeling homicidal, suicidal, I go into this sort-of panic where I start thinking absurd things which don't seem absurd at the time and I just start thinking stuff like ""it's a simulation."" ""God is against me."" to start screaming and just laughing frantically asking to i'm not even sure who? maybe god? (I was raised a christian and I don't want to be it's only causes me pain.) asking if he thinks its fun i'm in so much pain. If he thinks it's funny. I've relapsed on hurting myself and it's not good because i used to cut like 5 times a day, and now it's coming back.  Everyday my emotions, thoughts, and who I am seem to switch. I'm the same person...I think. Although, i'll go from feeling nothing, no panic, no nothing to feeling panic all the time. Maybe i'm just unstable as fuck haha lmao that'd be sucky. I know I'll be dead in 2 years. Or less. I feel the urge to kill people all the time, I feel free after convincing myself I killed someone in my fantasies. Sounds, touch, all of my senses are so fucking unbearable. noises hurt. They cause un- comfort. Panic. same with touch. sometimes with textures. I feel kinda trapped and I just. REALLY fucking hate what's going on and want to hurt someone or myself, I want to cut again, I can't wait to fucking die, I'm tired of being played with",19May2019,3

6,"I'm not really sure what to title this but in short, I've been struggling with my mental illness getting in the way of my relationships. I say things to hurt people that I don't mean. I cancel plans because I worry about the outcome too much. I expect way too much out of people, to the point of ending relationships over expectations rather than working them out. I probably sound like an asshole (and maybe I am) but it's way too easy for me to just blame my mental illness for all of my social struggles. I realize that I need to take responsibility for my actions and not let my emotions get in the way, but I'm still figuring that out.

The main reason I'm writing this now (after years of short lasting friendships/relationships) is because I said a lot of mean things to my boyfriend last night and deeply regret everything I said. I'm sober so I'm usually the DD, but when I parked his nice car I accidentally scraped the tire rim against the curb. As we were walking to the next bar, I felt like he was making it a much bigger deal than it was. I understood that I fucked up after the first few times of him asking me why I did it and explaining why it was such a big deal, but he kept going on about it in front of his friends. When we got to the bar, I immediately went to the bathroom to cry, then isolated myself by vaping outside. We didn't talk the whole ride home because I told him that I would get too pissed off to drive if he kept shaming me.

When we got to his house, the argument escalated quickly. I thought of everything wrong about our relationship, which got in the way of all the good in the relationship. Sometimes what he says feels like he's shaming me, but then I realize that he really hasn't come into close contact with anyone who has bipolar ii and anxiety. He'll say things like ""Stop feeling mad,"" ""I'm sorry I let you drive my car,"" and ""Don't cry""(I cried for 2 hrs straight last night). Maybe I'm just being too sensitive but it really hurts to feel like I'm not allowed to feel anything but sunshine and rainbows. He said that I wasn't really allowing him to feel his frustration either.

I'm not going to go over the whole conversation but I ended up saying ""fuck you,"" calling him an asshole, and telling him I wanted to break up. After I realized that I didn't mean any of it I tried to take it back. When I got home this morning  he called and said he was willing to try to work things out. I want to acknowledge that he has been really good to me throughout the relationship. The main flaw is in him not knowing what to say when I get really depressed or angry. Sometimes I forget that I can't rely on him/others to make me feel better. Deep down I know I'm the only one who can make myself feel better, I just thought it wouldn't hurt to ask for some advice.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** The issue is that when I feel overly emotional,  I self-sabotage and end relationships. Any advice would be helpful. Specifically, I'm asking for some advice on any of the following topics:

* not letting my emotions get the best of me in social situations
* how to overcome actions that I regret instead of giving up on relationships that could be saved
* letting go of expectations in relationships
* how to stop letting my mental illness define me as a person",19May2019,1

1. Something embarrassing that I have done 
2. Something crappy someone has done to me
Recently I have been having a bit of an issue with #2. This is because some guy I used to go to school with sent me a text after we hadn’t spoken for a year after we had a falling out. First, he followed me on Instagram, I didn’t want to start any drama with him (I was trying to avoid this EXACT scenario) so naturally I blocked him. What I didn’t account for, however, was my art account. He followed it and sent me a private message which read the following: “you probably still hate me for being me”. First of all, I don’t hate him. In fact, I can’t even remember why we had a falling out because I haven’t even thought about this dude for a year. Second of all, what the hell? Why would you message someone out of the blue just to fucking mess with their head? I think I’ve improved a lot over the past year and I’m getting better everyday, but things like this where I just can’t let go of something make me feel like everything I’ve done to change was useless. I know this is probably a ridiculous problem to have compared to some of the things you awesome people have had the courage to post on here. If anyone has any advice on how I could learn to let go, or just any thoughts about the subject at all, please comment. All feedback is welcomed and thank you for taking some time to read this.",19May2019,1
9,"TL:DR at end. Therapeutic post, and really like rslash (super sexy voice, and I love a man who loves dogs.)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm new(ish) to reddit, and am not really sure where the best place to post this would be.

&amp;#x200B;

I never had to try hard in high school. I always was happy with C's and B's, and focused more on building my social clubs up (I was wrongly lead to believe that this actually mattered for University.) I was editor of the Newspaper, Treasurer of the Drama Club, Fine Arts Advisor on the Student Activity Council (SAC), Math Club (socially, I was terrible at math, but they needed numbers to stay school sanctioned and a friend asked) and was also on the choir and active in volunteer activities.   

  
Things changed in my last year of high school. You see, I'm gay. I had a girlfriend in my junior year, and tried to 'get into girls.' We'd hang out, and tried having sex a few times but it never really connected for either of us (I later found out she came out as 'asexual' in her 20's). We parted amicably, and lost touch (again, a side effect of early teen romance.) And I came to the realization that I was gay and that it was awesome and who cares what other people have to say about it.     


The summer of my senior year I met and fell for my first 'friend'. As with most first romances, things fizzled out after a few months, and I walked away a bit sad but otherwise unscathed. It gave me the courage to start to come out to my close friends. In the late 90's and early 00's, in a small town community, I'd been doing a great job keeping this a secret to all but my closest buddies. I didn't really care if it got out, because it was my last year at school and felt I was popular enough to keep my social status.   


I should point out that I also had a tumultuous home life at the time. My Dad was transferred to Winnipeg, and so my Mom, Dad and youngest brother were moving there in December. I was going to stay in my town to finish the school year, and my Bio-Dad had rented me an apartment near his office so he could check in on me. But I was essentially living alone, as my Bio-Dad travelled frequently and I wasn't a fan of my Step-mother so I tended to avoid going over there unless Bio-Dad was home.

     
My middle brother (R.I.P) was also getting pretty into drugs and had run away from home. He was a year younger than me in the same school, and they kind of realized that I was having some home issues. But I did okay in school, and was very active in social clubs so teachers were vouching for me, so they just kind of let me do my own thing. Because I was moving into a new apartment and helping my Mom and Dad pack to move, I would often sign out (cut) class a few times a week to help out. 

  
I felt pretty good, and started to come out to my closest friends. Almost everyone was supportive and agreed not to make it a big deal.   
  

Except for one person. 'Z'. 'Z' asked if she could join the newspaper in the final year so she could pad her college application, but never turned in a single article. She joined choir, but quit after the second rehearsal because she wasn't getting a solo (the girl who did get a solo had been in choir for 4 years and even though they were both skilled, the choir teacher gave it to the girl who put the work in). She also tried to get the same position on the SAC (she wanted to do it alone, and didn't want to go through the election process and so the teacher made the decision to just split it in two.) She said she didn't want it when she didn't get to do it alone. The one position she kept was Vice-president of the Drama Club.   
  

As part of the school's drama club at a mostly jock school, there were about twenty people in our school's drama club. As a senior, I wound up with some choice lead parts. It was a lot of fun. I hung out with my drama friends outside of school more than my other circle of friends, and had known them since I had joined in my grade 10 year. I was no Nicholas Cage, but I enjoyed acting and had considered making it a career.   
  

I started to open up to this group first. Of course, being theatre kids, they were pretty cool about the 'whole gay thing'. None of them were gay, although a few later called themselves bisexual (Z included). So even though I was still 'the only gay in the village', it didn't really bother me because I'd be moving to the big city for university next year, and none of my friends cared.   
  

Now, Z has a reputation at this point in school. Z seemed to get worked up with someone on a year by year basis. I don't want to tell their stories because it is their stories to tell. I'll abbreviate, by saying that one of the girls later dropped out for homeschooling (I don't even remember the reason), and another girl wound up transferring (she got the lead part in a play that Z wanted.) I wish I could say I was innocent in this, but with Z, you kind of had to go along with her as those who did not would often become the target of her wrath. High school politics are bullshit.   
  

Z had set her sights on me the last year of school.   
  

Over the next few months, Z started digging into me. She'd just question everything about my sexuality, sometimes in front of our friends, sometimes in front of other people (who I was not comfortable having know these things), sometimes alone. It was annoying, but because of her reputation, and because (at the time) I was pretty mentally stable, I let it go.   
  

A big part of the drama club was going to Tim Horton's for a few hours after rehearsals. Honestly, this was the best part of the night, because we'd often have the whole restaurant to ourselves, and we could let loose. High school kids in a small town really don't have much to do, so in retrospect this was kind of lame, but it was still awesome.     
  

As one of the only people with access to a vehicle, I would often drive my drama friends home after these activities, or to the beach of a park to hang out. I didn't drink or do drugs, so it kind of gave my friends an opportunity to let loose if they wanted to do that, and I was pretty responsible for my friends safety. As Z lived close to me, she'd often be the last person I'd drop off. I would purposely try to avoid doing this, but again, Z had a reputation and it was just easier this way.   
  

One night, it came to a head. Z asked if I was really gay, and I responded that I was. Z then asked me some personal questions that I felt uncomfortable asking. If I had been with a woman? If I bled my first time? How did I know I was gay?   
 

It made me upset. Eventually Z got out of my car and I went home. I didn't sleep that night, and the next day, approached her to tell her that what she had grilled me on had made me uncomfortable and I really didn't want to keep bringing it up. In retrospect, this was a mistake.   
  

Z started turning people against me. It became explicit that being seen with me would cause exile of other people. My drama friends were uncomfortable but tried to ignore it. I made a conscious decision not to hang out with my drama friends. I hung out with some of my math club and choir club friends at lunch instead, and spent study period with some girls who were in my science classes.     
  

But there was still an obvious problem. We were going on a road trip to compete in a drama festival, and Z and I were in the same play. We were both leads in the play and spent a great deal of time on stage together. Z was also in charge of final makeup checks. I'd have to stare Z in the eye every time she came to critique my makeup. No one was allowed to help me aside from Z. It was tense.   
  

So I did what I did in stressful situations and I wrote. I love to write. It helped me put my thoughts in order and relieve stress. And as this person was trying to make my life miserable as per those other two girls, I wanted to wash all of this way and get through the last seven months of senior year.     
  

She liked a popular rock musician 'Jon Bon Jovi'. This was the year Napster and Limewire were popular so I downloaded a tonne of Jon Bon Jovi and burned it to a CD. I wrote a page long letter apologizing, and explaining some of my sexual history, and why I had reached these conclusions about myself. I then gave it to a mutual friend of ours to give to her. It really wasn't her business, but I was trying to make amends.   
 

 Z made copies of the letter.   
  

She handed them out to the most popular (and loud mouthed) kids in the school. I don't begrudge these people for what happened next (basically, the letter was passed around like a marijuana cigarette at a frat party), although one of the people (I never found out who exactly) did turn it in to the guidance counsellor when it was given to them. To that person, I would gladly buy you a beer and say thank you.   
  

The next day my parents were actually finishing packing to go to Winnipeg and I was moving into my new apartment near my dad. We were travelling to London, Ontario to compete that week and so my teachers already knew that that week was pretty much a wash for me when it came to class. So the day after Z got the note, I wasn't in school to try to mitigate what was happening.   
  

The guidance counsellor called my mom at her job and said that I needed to come in for a meeting the next day. Thankfully, he didn't say anything to her (she is a protective mom, and was gradually coming to terms with my sexuality and would not have handled it well). She passed the message along to me and I went to the school the next day.   
  

Part of my job with the Drama Club was to make morning announcements for events. We were raising money that day by selling hot chocolate for funds for our trip to London. When I got to the office, I saw Z sitting outside the office, and she gave me a 'look.' It wasn't quite a snarl, but it was not friendly. At this time I still had no idea what was going on. The school consellour was next door to the main office, and after the announcements he came out and took me into his office.   
  

He sat me down and showed me the letter I had written to Z. He told me that a copy of that letter had been distributed around the school, that they had confiscated at least 8 copies, and wanted to know what was going on. I was stunned. I knew that Z had a reputation, but doing something like this in a jock school in a conservative town was seriously no bueno. I went over the details with the guidance counsellor and principal (himself he told me later when he tried to set up a LGBT Alliance a 'Friend of Dorothy' he told me in confidence) and said that they wanted to know if I wanted to press charges.   
 

 The principal strongly advised against it (the guy had a bit of an issue with me already, and was pretty hard nosed and conservative.) He didn't want this to get out, and mentioned that if an official complaint was made, Z couldn't go on the trip to London, Ontario to perform, and all of the people in the Drama Club would blame me (pretty trashy thing for him to do.) He also said my parents would have to get involved since I was still a minor (for another 3 months), and they were already stressed with moving to a new province.     
  

The guidance counsellor said he'd support me if I wanted to do this, but that it might make things harder than they already are. He suggested that we call Z into the office and go over the issue with her. She came in and was bawling her eyes out. She was apologetic. She begged for another chance when she was threatened with expulsion. I was still stunned, and if this had happened today instead of almost 20 years ago, I would have come down with the hammer of Thor on this person, and demanded she pay for therapy and that the school take the appropriate action.     
  

I wish I could say that was what I did. Or that I did some other kind of r/prorevenge or r/nuclearrevenge on Z. Instead, I caved. I accepted her apology (and even apologized myself), and agreed to be friends and not let this continue. For the good of the drama club.   
  

I made it through the next year, and possibly because of how publicly I was outed, there was an aura of protection around me. People would generally not make fun of me about being gay, possibly because of what happened. Thankfully, most of my friends (and the people I cared about) were okay with this, even the ones who were not okay with homosexuality (conservative, religious, small town) even started to come around.     
  

Truthfully, it really messed me up for years. I was finally diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and that was also self fulfilling in the sense that this was a health issue that soldiers and police officers get. Not some teen-aged writer. It took almost a decade for me to get the help I needed, and even to this day I still struggle although I am far better now than I was then.   
 

 I changed my major from drama and writing to law. I didn't have any major relationships lasting longer than a few months. I fell out of touch with friends easily, drank too much, and partied too hard. I struggled in work and often job hopped. I also apartment hopped frequently and had problems with roommates. Truthfully, I became an asshole.   
  

Recently, my therapist suggested that I visualize my experience and put it into a balloon. Then put Z in the balloon and visualize letting the balloon go. But I also wanted to write it down and post it. I'm not sure if there's a cautionary tale somewhere here, but hopefully my experience can help others.

You see, ever since I introduced myself into the world of music (like 2/3 years ago; by this I do not mean playing instruments, more like listening to it), when I discover a new artist/genre I tend to be stuck with that certain artist/genre for some time.

For example, I discovered the *Steampunk* genre (which, in itself is not a genre, but whatever) some days ago, so I started looking for some artists today and it has come to a point where I do not want to listen to anything that is not Steampunk music; however, when I do listen to it, I feel stressed, like I have an obssession and I am hurting myself because of it, and it just gives me anxiety.

Today, I was exhausted. I didn't shower, I didnt eat. Around 7:30 I decided to force myself, energy or not, to throw my hair in a bun and go downtown. Just to walk around, surround myself with people. I brought my camera and I listened to music while I walked. I didn't end up taking any pictures because I didn't feel like it. I thought this would help but the entire time I thought about going home and getting back into bed. I hardly had the energy to get myself back home but I did. I don't remember the entire subway ride home. I think I was completely zoned out the entire time. When I got home I went to my bed, stripped the sheets. Sometimes changing the sheets helps. I couldn't even do that. I pulled the fitted sheet off and cried. I feel terrible. I want this feeling to end. I miss feeling okay.",19May2019,3
23,"Sometimes. I act like a psychopath. Impulsivity. 

It's as edgy as it sounds. Not like I kill people or shit. Just sometimes I'll have these moments where my sense of rational thought shuts off and I'll say and do inhumane things to people no matter what their relationship is to me.  Like we'll be fooling around and shooting each other with nerf blasters as kids. And I'll run out of ammo and throw the whole gun at your face and not feel bad about it until someone calls me out on breaking your nose.  I'll get slightly annoyed with someone and say some shit I can't take back like ""I hope he gets cancer""  at the time it happens there isn't anything in my brain writing it off as a bad idea.  I just have the urge to do it.  Looking back on the shit I've done growing up and still doing shit like that at age 21 makes me feel like a monster.  So I ask you. And this is dead serious.

27,"So, I was in the shower this evening. I was planning on taking an extra long and relaxing shower. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to enjoy it. I put on music and lit some candles. I was never able to relax and was continuously feeling a sense of dread. I got a small paint on the back of my head where my neck and skull meet. I figure it was nothing but then my knee started to ache. (I have weak knees so that is normal) I decided to sit down in the shower with my head in the running water with my hands over my ears. For some reason, I started to have an intense feeling something was in the bathroom and behind me in the shower. The water sounded like it had slowed down.

I was reluctant to purchase this, self improvement is scary.

Eventually after working up the courage, I sat down with my best friend and talked to her about my journey and how I'm feeling. It was emotional, and I made sure to communicate how hard it was for me to do. I then asked for her help; the first task is to have loved ones provide lists of positive attributes they see in you (I explained I wholeheartedly need help in this, I hate myself and see nothing positive). I brought this up with her multiple times, not thinking it was too much since I regularly try to encourage her.

The main point that both my parents take out of that argument was not that I might have a lot more issues that both they and outside forces caused, but because I have anger issues. So, after some talk with the family doctor, the doctor came to a conclusion that I should see a psychiatrist for help or to confirm that I do have anger issues and how to combat that.

32,"With the new game of thrones season coming out I’ve been rewatching season 7 and as it comes to an end it reminds me of my 2nd complete melt down...

After watching season 7 episode 7 one night I went to sleep, the next morning I woke up in a daze, I felt unable to comprehend what was going on, I took a shower and at some point during the shower I felt unable to remember anything, I couldn’t remember my name, I couldn’t remember anything that wasn’t happening at real time.

At this point I had already had a therapist and was living with family, I tried to call my therapist but he wasn’t answering, I paced around my room in about 5 steps back and forth completely unaware of anything and trying to comprehend what was going on.

After all this I heard my mom drive up into the driveway and I basically ran out to her, mind you I’m 29 years old so don’t be upset about mental health it affects all of us. She instantly knew something was wrong and started to call 911, I ended up on the phone with the operator while waiting for an ambulance, I remember saying thank you operator 457 cause that was her # but I don’t remember much else from that point.

After being shuttled to the ER I remember sitting in a bed being asked to take of my clothes and put on a hospital gown, being unable to remember anything I said I don’t know how, this at one point infuriated the nurse because she and the ambulance workers and other people at the hospital thought I was just being difficult.

I had no idea what was going on and at one point I told them I was the 3 eyed raven and could remember everything and see the future anyways things worked out for me and I haven’t had any panic attacks or loss of consciousness for over a year, I hope you all read this and understand, mental health is difficult, panic attack stop after 10-15 minutes, keep up the good fight, message me if you need help with anything :)",19May2019,3
33,"I \[17M\] have always had a rocky relationship with my parents. I have pretty full-on verbal fights with them, and I don't want to do it anymore. So when I was thinking about the reason it happens, I came back to the common factor here: is it all my fault? I've been called a disappointment and a waste of talent, and maybe it's because I am. What if I *am* letting my parents down. I can't bring myself to accept this if it is the truth... All these conflicts because I was too stubborn to recognise that I'm at fault here. I just want to disappear - go start a new life somewhere else. Maybe the reason I have the urge to hurt myself is because I know that I really do deserve it deep down. That thought scares me.

So now she's medicated, and doing a lot better, but now she's back in my life and is being very kind and positive. The problem is after everything we don't know how to be around each other, and due to this at times I feel a good bit of sexual tension when we're alone.

36,"About 2 months ago a doctor pulled her off of her lithium. She was admitted to a hospital because of an over-dosage, doctor said to cut her off, and she hasn't had her prescription for lithium since. She hasn't had a regular psychiatrist (gets her regular doctor to refill her other prescriptions), so she's been taking the same dosage of all of her psych meds for years now. But, at this point she couldn't get a refill for lithium, which she needs for her bipolar disorder. 

Since being taken off of lithium, she started getting better, but declined more and more in the last few weeks. She's been a lot more quick to anger, and been crying a lot more. She also hadn't slept or at in a few nights since yesterday (I fed her and tried to get her to nap when she came over). And some of her choices have been very erratic and not logical (like trying to end her lease early, walking around on a broken foot for 3 miles at 3am in my city, etc).

She started acting very similar to how she did when she had a manic episode when I was a kid. She came over unexpectedly to my apartment, and after much discussion, I was able to convince her to admit herself to a mental ward for evaluation.

However, today she called me because she got into an altercation with another patient, said the she get punched and that she's leaving. I tried to explain that she can't leave without a doctor's approval, and started shifting the blame to me saying that I put her in there and that she's going to be very pissed and blame me if I don't get her out. I told her that I can't do that and she hung up the phone in anger. 

I called the nurses station to get their side. They confirmed that there was a verbal altercation, and that they got into each other's faces, but it was broken up before anything could happen, so she wasn't hit. The nurse told me that she has been angry and aggressive thus far in her stay. She also told me to ignore the phone calls for now as she's not in the right mind, and that she'll try to bargain with me and blame me for leaving her there, and to call to get a nurse's opinion before coming to physically visit, as since she's mad at me, she it will likely make the situation worse until her meds and her mood levels out. 

This is all been during finals last week for college, and at this point I'm very confused and emotionally exhausted. I keep questioning whether or not I took her into the right place, or did the right thing. 

I'm extremely afraid that they will release her as soon as they have her stable. It seems like to me that she needs to stay in for a bit and get her medication and mood balanced out. But, that's according the doctor's orders. But she hasn't been mentally well for a minute now, so I'm really afraid they'll release her before she's ready to be released. All of her kids live out of city (I'm the closest physically to her), so I need to be sure that she is 100% before I can trust her on her own. Is there a likely chance they'll release her early?

Has anyone else been through something like this?

tl;dr Took my mom in, she called and left several voicemails saying that I sent her into a loony bin with a bunch of nut jobs, and that shes' in grave danger. She said the nurses are lying and ignoring her being accosted. I'm starting to doubt whether I did the right thing. Is this a normal response for someone who admitted themselves in? Also, is there any chance she'll get out early?

So I have this friend. We've been friends since we started college in September and everything was going really well until recently. He started to get uncomfortably close to me and would constantly touch me. When we weren't at college I would get messages all the time. The thing is something similar has happened before and it ended up really badly. I know he wouldn't do that but I still get a trigger from it.

I don't want to completely stop spending time with him. He's a good friend, but I just need some space. He's having a hard time giving it to me though. He keeps messaging our other friend and keeps going on about how this is all an overreaction and we should all get over it. I feel bad because I know he's really unhappy. He's suffered with mental health issues and has never really had many friends. He's threatening to leave college if we don't talk to him.

40,"Hello,

I'm here because I feel stuck. I really need an advice or at least a possibility to get some things out of my chest. I hate how my life looks right now.

I was always a shy kid but it didn't affect my life that much. Everything changed when I entered high school. I started developing depression, realized I'm not just shy - I have social anxiety. I closed myself to people, lost every friend I could and also lost ability to speak to people. It was the worst part of my life. I'm year after graduating, couldn't go to college because I was afraid. I can't find a job because of my social anxiety. The situation in my home doesn't make it better. My dad have a problem with alcohol. There is no physical violence (not yet anyways). It's a serious problem but he doesn't see it as one. He doesn't respect my mother, he is pretty harsh towards her and my mom just takes it. I have 2 brothers (younger and older). He repsects the older one because he has an ability to speak up. My younger brother just doesn't care about what's going on around him. He either studies or just play games all day in his room and only time he leaves it is when he visits his gf. The problem here is all of us are getting older. My older brother is about to get married so he won't be here that much anymore to help my mom. My younger brother won't be much of a help he will probably start college in a year-ish but it's not like he cares abou what's goin on. And about me... I'm confused. I'm starting therapy in next week (social anxiety). I don't know if it's gonna work and how long is it going to take to fix anything. I wanted to start changing my life - getting work and slowly progressing so I can move out from my parents as this toxic atmosphere is overwhelming. I already feel like shit because I'm a loser who can't get anything done this family stuff doesn't make it easier. I'm scared to leave my mom alone with this but I can't imagine living here for long. I'm from a small village with no opportunities in an area. My mom is saying sometimes that it's nice that she has someone to help her to deal with it and we'll help each other. I feel guilty, I didn't want to say that I want to move away as soon as possible.

So there you have it. I'm sorry if I made it long, and maybe chaotic at some parts. I just started speaking my mind and got kinda lost in this. I'm really at a lost here. Any advice would be helpful but I'm fine with some of you just reading it because as I said at the start I just wanted to get some things out of my chest. I hope life goes better for all of you.

42,"So the title might have been a little vague but I'd detail everything, wrote too many words for the title limit.

Also, English isn't my native language so pardon me for any mistakes and thanks for looking into this.

I'm 23 male. I have been dealing with let's say issues for almost 6-7 years, it was mild at the start but now it seems to have taken over me. I graduated from college last year and I've since struggled for work since. 

Please help me identify are these real things or I'm just a sour loser.

And I'm scared of judgement if people around me know it that I've something going on and I'm seeking help here.

There's a list of things that happen: 
 
A. Emotions and anger

1. There are things I'd read or listen about and they'll anger me up, I'll end up overthinking about things and anger will last for hours.

1. Smallest confrontations with people around me will rile me up and there's no coming back from it for days, sometimes a small recalling of those moments gets me angry.

1. I am an emotionally volatile person and smallest of things sometimes hurt me, scare

B. Overthinking

1. This is one big issue, I'll see something and put myself in those situations and will end up thinking over different scenarios, putting in a lot of time(I don't know why)

2. I have plans and dreams for future and I constantly end up overthinking about them, repeatedly, thinking over minute details of how it should work and how things will set out and literally like it's happening right now.

C. Rejection and Failure

1. I have been going through challenges and interviews and I've been rejected so many times, getting ghosted after applications, after interviews, straight out failure, rejection letters, and now I have developed a fear that my career is doomed, it's directionless and I can't sleep anymore, the thought of failure keeps me awake.

1. I have seen friends and others going in relationships, and they are drifting apart while I don't have anyone like that, I want to put myself out there but being a complete failure in a career just doesn't allow me. 

1. My failures in past haunt me, the current failures made me so scared of life that since I failed in past I have ruined foundations of my future life and I'll end up struggling while everyone around me will be far ahead of me.

D. Family

1. My parents have arguments, and angry one's pretty much every other day on petty issues regarding their siblings and they would stop talking, we are all at dinner but there's a killing silence, and there is barely any word unless it's passing or serving something. It's like we are forced to be together.

2. Although my parents have acted they are trying to be supportive, but at the first minute they have a person from our family having something, I go down the drain and for that time, they're priorities change, even in the crucial junctures like examinations, they force me to adjust so once in a while I look like an obedient and accommodating son.

E. Self Talk

1. This might sound odd but I talk to myself, sometimes in my head, sometimes at nights when I'm alone in my room, the in a soft voice(so that no one can hear), and if I am all alone at home, it'll be in my normal voice. I speak sometimes thinking of something I want to do in my life, enacting like there's an audience(small/large all sorts) and I'm addressing them. And this happens pretty much every day now. Have I lost it completely?

F. Loss of Focus

1. Even though I have failed so far, I believe to learn and live is the best way going forward and I'm every day learning something new that might eventually be helpful in my career, but culmination of all things above I have focus of 15 minutes and then I'll be distracted, this is the worst part, learning something helps me take my mind off everything.

G. Sleep and dreams

1. Add in factors A, B, C, D, E and I can promise you I haven't slept well in years. If I  can have a small nap of 10 minutes and I'll end up dreaming. For full night sleep, I'll end up with 3 or 4 dreams, not necessarily connected to each other, I'm waking up tired probably because of this.

I'm at times having thoughts to end it all, but I feel it'll be utterly stupid to end my life without giving a proper fight to whatever I'm dealing with, and for my age, there are probably good days ahead of me, but yeah suicidal thoughts do hit me sometimes.

All of this keeps me angry and fickle al the time, even little things can get a strong reaction out of me.

I gained a lot of weight so started to work out on my own a bit, and frankly speaking that one hour is probably the best hour of my day, I'm so focused on what I'm doing that I actually feel relaxed mentally the whole time.

Thanks for reading all the way, please advise/help here if you can. I just want some confirmation before proceeding for medical help(I have almost no money and I just want something before I ask it from my parents).

Anyways have a nice Sunday :)",19May2019,9

45,"[AZ]

Me and my boyfriend have been dating for a year and two months. The first month after I started dating him, I felt myself start to slowly change. 

It was nothing bad at first. Just me becoming more attached and adjusting my humor to match his. After the 7th month, we started to live together because of my family issues. This is where it started to fall apart.

I've always had issues with seeing things and hearing voices. Before this, it was only happening when I was anxious or panicking. It starting becoming more and more frequent as I got more attached to my boyfriend. He obviously was starting to get annoyed with it as well. 

At this point, it's gotten out of hand. Every time he will get mad at me, everything inside of me tells me to kill myself. I everyone I've ever cared about tell me to kill myself, and that I'm worthless and I'll finally be happy if I'm dead. I don't think it's his fault, I know this is completely my mental issues. 

I'm completely aware that the voices and hallucinations are fake but they still greatly influence my emotions and actions. They're too much and I have to give in sometimes. I love him so fucking much and I don't know why because he's a huge dick to me. Or at least I perceive him to be, but recently I've been having delusions about people so he might be fine.

I don't know what's going on with me anymore. I'm living at his friends house because I got kicked out in October. He moved back with his mom because he couldn't stand me, and everytime we break up we mutually decide to get back together or I try to kill myself and it scares him. 

I know this is beyond wrong but I cannot seem to stop myself from doing these things. If I lose him, I die. 

All I've ever wanted is to be independent and happy. Ive gone to therapy twice before I got kicked out, and I no longer have insurance or money to pay for it. Im underaged as well. 

I'm completely miserable and the last time I was happy was when I did MDMA.

1) telepathy - on three seperate occasions I've ""heard others thoughts."" I don't know how else to explain this, but I just guarantee they weren't my own.

A list of things I remember these voices saying ""no thats not right, his middle name wasn't Mason"" , ""I need to call Rachel back"" ""128 Square street"" and random things like that usually containing someones name or address. The only unpleasant one I can think of is someone trying to spell their name and getting angry cause I couldn't hear all the letters.

&amp;#x200B;

2) Shadows moving - I've had multiple occasions of shadows moving in the past and usually it scared me but it was always a glimpse out of the corner of my eye, one of the reasons I've started posting now is because I've had two shadow encounters in the past two days and both were more than a glimpse. The first was a ghost like shadow that kept getting closer when I closed my eyes, I played with this shadow multiple times squinting my eyes and watching it shimmy closer before opening them wide and seeing it fly away. The other time I watched a shadow quiver and shake trying to wriggle its way across the ceiling, I had to keep frowning at it to stop it from getting too close (this happened at the same time one of the telepathy things happened.)

&amp;#x200B;

3) Faces changing - We have speeches at school and whenever I'd watch someone say their speech, they'd change drastically getting older or younger or specific features would become larger or smaller, at one point I was talking to a girl I didn't know too well and completely blanked on her name because in front of me shed changed into someone I didn't know. For a period of time a couple months ago I also could not recognise my own face because whenever I'd look in the mirror it would change, most of the time in a fascinating way but sometimes scary like my eyes disappearing - and at one point I had morphed into the girl from the ring. (I now stay away from horror movies so as to not give my brain any ideas)

&amp;#x200B;

There are a few other things like seeing a ghost, self harm and extreme illogical fear. However I don't go into detail on these things as they happened months ago and I don't want to drag this post on for too long.

&amp;#x200B;

So please, does anyone else experience one or a few of these things? and if so what does any of it mean?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you :)

52,"Hi guys, I have a crush on this girl in my college, but she's already taken by someone else. I was feeling so low about this that I couldn't hold it anymore and thought to be bold and share my feelings to her and then move on with life.
On her birthday I baked a cake for her and she loved it , also at the moment I did express my situation. She replied that it won't work as she's got a boyfriend already and she said she would see me like her special friend and nothing more.
I knew exactly what she would respond so I wasn't surprised. But since her relationship was a bit distance relationship each time she need a help or anything I would do it for her. We had a great time in college as friends but deep inside of me I was so low in knowing the fact that she won't be mine. I also get the fact that it's so bad to ask out another manhs girl so with all respect I treated her like a good friend.
Later this week few of her friends asked her if we were dating or something. She felt bad that she didn't wanted people to see things in that perspective and she did inform me about this and asked me what she should be doing in situation like this.
I told her it's better that we separate and not be friends anymore as it would be good for both of us. But she responded like ""No!!!"" I'm not loosing a friend just because someone said something.
Later she called me to have an open conversation on this. At this time I did tell her that I still have feelings for her and all that I did for her was because I had the feelings.
She did respond again that not to expect anything from her and we could just be friends.
The next day she like sent a text message to me regarding college work. But after that till today she or I haven't talked. We use to like talk everyday and now all of a sudden all gone.
Please do help me in knowing what I should be doing as this is putting me such a pain.
Was I making an awkward situation for her?
Am I a so bad person?

53,"Hello all! I'd like to introduce [my new subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthUK/). As someone from the UK who has dealt with mental health issues for years, I've noticed a lack of active UK spaces and would like to try and change that if there is the demand for it. Anyone is welcome to participate but I would prefer it if people who are not from the UK only talk about their specific healthcare processes/systems if relevant to a comments discussion rather than promoting it - just so we dont get swamped out/conflicting information due to uneven population. I'm hoping it can be a sub where people can either ask questions, talk with like minded people, give support, vent or promote their own blogs or work if related to mental health/therapy.

## How do you make huge changes in your life?

📷

Hopefully this will not be as cringe of a post as I feel it to be.

First, thank you for taking the time to read this and consider answering it.

I am going to be 26 in 1 day and I am completely unsatisfied with my life. I want things to be different but something keeps holding me back.

First, I managed to leave the house only to come back 3 times.

I have failed school a bunch of times as well.

I had a car and wrecked it driving while sleepy.

I have Credit issues.

I have Avoided Legal issues.

I have Avoided Tax issues.

I have had multiple jobs and been fired from them.

I am not an independent adult.

Everything in my life is fucked right now.

I have the worst work ethic imaginable.

I am lazy, and unmotivated.

I am a professional procrastinator

I dont even think I possess consistent self discipline.

I put myself and find myself in great positions only to self-sabotage by avoidance and procrastination.

When I start things, I start with so much bravado. I out perform and everyone likes me. Then i loose steam and flunk miserably. Then everyone hates me. This is in everything (Jobs, Relationships, School especially)

I start things but never follow through with them.

I have such big goals and dreams for myself. But I get in my own way and fuck myself up. EVERY SINGLE TIME.

I feel like its either because I dont believe in myself enough or that I feel that I dont deserve it.

I am told that I am smart and have the potential to achieve great things but i dont live up to my potential. That I sell myself short 100% of the time.

My relationships with people are atrocious. I feel as though I cannot effectively communicate well.

Sometimes I feel like I dont understand people well because people say that I ask the same thing over again. Or im not satisfied with their answer.

I hear a lot that I am not capable of things.

I constantly hear: your telling me you want change, but i feel you dont want it bad enough.

I dont want to go through another year of being a mediocre human being when I feel that I am more than this.

I honestly feel like I this is a symptom of me not understanding myself and what motivates me.

I really want better for myself but i have this extreme feeling of apathy.

I dont want to continue this cycle.

I just dont know where to start or even begin to fix this massive clusterfuck.

I appreciate any help you can give me.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and consider answering",19May2019,1
55,"Hi guys, 

So I have an aunt who is suffering from un-diagnosed mental issues. The below points summarise the issue:

1. she's an alcoholic
2. she has terrifying anger issues and has been violent on many occasions with different people
3. she once swallowed a bunch of pills in an attempt to take her life, but we were advised by a mental health counselor that it was more likely of a cry for help than anything else
4. she has thrown violent tantrums when drunk which she either doesn't remember or denies
5. she refuses to seek professional help and believes that we (her family) are all out to get her and that there is nothing wrong with her

  
We do not have access to any proper and reliable mental health facilities where I'm from and thus we do not want her admitted. We do however have access to many mental health professionals, so I am asking if anyone has any advice as to how I can convince her to seek the right help.

57,"After speaking with a client yesterday who wanted help for his ""panic attacks"" only to find out that what he was actually suffering from were ""anxiety attacks"", I thought I would try to explain the difference between the two. The two terms are often used interchangeably, in media and online especially, which is a mistake as they are actually very different in terms of their cause, experience and treatment. I know *Russel Brand* recently posted a video for ""panic attacks or anxiety attacks"" whilst only referring to anxiety attacks, also in the ""*Nadiya: Anxiety and Me*"" BBC Documentary, Nadiya referred to her attacks as panic attacks, although they were in fact anxiety attacks. All of this can be very misleading to people going through it and can prevent them from getting the right kind of help they need. Hopefully this post will help people understand which one they suffer from and thus help them to find the right treatment in order to recover. 

# Cause:

**Anxiety Attack**: A stressor in your life e.g. part of social or gen. anxiety, such as: money, the future, stress, relationships, ""what if"" etc. There is usually a clearly identifiable trigger for the attack. Often feels *""MORE MENTAL THAN PHYSICAL""*

**Panic Attack**: The fear of experiencing physical symptoms, either that you're already experiencing or fear experiencing again in the future. They are often described as happening ""out of the blue"" without a trigger (although the trigger is actually the fear of the physical symptoms themselves). Caused by misunderstanding and non-acceptance of the physical symptoms. NOT RELATED TO LIFE STRESS. Often feels *""MORE PHYSICAL THAN MENTAL""*

# Experience:

**Anxiety attack:** although they do include physical symptoms, the person is still ""panicking"" about the situation that got them into the attack e.g. the social situation that has given them anxiety, their money issue etc, and not the physical symptoms themselves. Person may feel like they have to leave certain social situation to calm down as that is what is causing it.

**Panic Attack:** this is always about the physical symptoms, there are several fears someone has with a panic attack but they are always linked to the physical symptoms, these are the most common: ""I'm dying/seriously ill and need to go to hospital"" ""I'm going ""crazy""/ I have ""schizophrenia/bipolar"" ""I'm scared of when they will come back"" 

# Treatment:

**Anxiety attack:** these are part of someone's current levels of social or general anxiety; therapy with a psychotherapist or similar where you can find the underlying causes and mechanisms that cause this anxiety to occur is best.

**Panic Attacks:** CBT therapy/Acceptance therapy/Panic Peer Recovery, the person needs to understand what is happening to their body and why, and then train themselves to fully overcome the fear of the physical symptoms and eventually they will stop. 

&amp;#x200B;

Note: it is entirely possible to initially experience an anxiety attack that then evolves into a panic attack as the physical symptoms become so intense. I would suggest getting help for the anxiety as that is the initial cause.",19May2019,245

60,"I've known my friend, lets call her ""April"" for 5 years, She is my best friend and we tell each other everything.  
Today I found out that for at least 4 of those 5 years shes been committing self harm, of what type I can only guess and it makes me want to throw up.  
Every time I think about it I go on the verge of having a panic attack, my heart sinks, and I have a void in my stomach and I start to cry.  


Here's how I found out.  
I was playing video games and decided to hop in a discord call with her as we normally do around 5 Pm or so.  
We talk and have a good time and then she mumbles to herself ""1 year clean, cool"" me being noisy and thinking its no big deal like ""One year clean of not pooping your pants"" or something overly silly like that I start to make ""Funny"" jokes about it and push to know what the actual reason is.  
After 30 minutes of me bugging her she mumbles it and I couldn't hear her so she types it.  
And when I see my heart sinks.  
What really gets to me is I know... I \*Know\* that when she was doing this to herself and going through God KNOWS what.  
I would be over here laughing and carrying on about random shit, none the wiser.  
I mean it was ONLY A YEAR AGO!  
What gets me is not so much that she did these things, but she didn't tell me and give me a chance to help, so my question for help regarding my mental health and above ALL else is how the hell can I help her, with all my heart I want to help her never ever even so much as think about doing anything like this ever again, because honestly I'm thrown completely for a loop, and have no idea what to do to help her.

I think about him a lot and ever since my mom said “maybe his parents don’t miss him cuz he might’ve been drinking and smoking every night” I think that maybe if I did that (I’m very much not a party kid, pretty antisocial) and then did the main thing, then my parents won’t miss me. I plan all these hypotheticals out but I’m not gonna go through with them. The idea of going on seems impossible but so does doing all the things I think about. Am I suicidal or is this just a thing that everyone does?

64,"First of all, I have been with my boyfriend for 3 years and a half now, and I never had any doubts about my feelings for him. I love him a lot, and he offers a lot of support and care. He's honestly too good for me, and  you will know why in a second.

I'm 20, an only child, with a father who tried to commit suicide countless times. My childhood was terrible, I self harmed and was anorexic when I was 13-15. Now I am back overweight, will finish school soon and without a job.

I am a very anxious and... intense person. My mood changes more than the weather, and I am very indecisive with EVERYTHING. I managed to change my mind 5 times today in less than 3 minutes.

I tend to exaggerate, and when my boyfriend and I fight it gets intense pretty fast because of me. Today, we fought over the silliest thing, but I somehow told him to leave and never come back. But, when he did leave I got mad that he left and wanted to break up. But, when he agreed, I changed my mind.

Honestly? I do not know why the hell I said those things, and this isn't the first time this happened either. I am so mad and disappointed in myself. I have found the most caring and wonderful guy in the world, but I am STILL sabotaging it. I also told him I will get help twice already but never did. Today I managed to send a message to a psychologist group to make an appointment.

&amp;#x200B;

I always manage to sabotage the good things I have. I do not know if my boyfriend will even want me now. I am so disgusted with myself. Even reading through what I am writing, I cannot believe I turned this way. I hate this so much, I HATE my character. I HATE IT. But I don't know what to do to change. Please do know that I love my boyfriend more than anything, and that I never cheated or wanted to hurt him intentionally. But if he does want to get back together, shall we?

I will be getting help this time, that's for sure. I am just so mad at myself for hurting this innocent guy. I am SO MAD that I cannot control my moods well. I honestly wish I was someone else right now, someone who deserves to be loved by him.

66,"I’m really looking for some kind words of advice today :/

A friend with no prior history of mental disorders or symptoms is not well Right now and I don’t know what to do. Neither does her family 

21 year old female was put under article and held in a psychiatric hospital for three weeks after having MDMA induced Psychosis (only time she has done mdma ever) before then I believe she smoked a little bit of marijuana but not much) she had hallucinations, delusions, bizarre speech and Mania ( she went through a breakup aswell which I believe contributed to most of this ) - treated with olanzapine and made a full ‘recovery’ towards the final week, doctors wanted her to stay longer but she obviously kicked off and her family wanted her to come with them so she was let out after showing improvement.

For about 9 months she seemed fine put on weight, was active and all sound. Till about a few months recently I started to see her show symptoms again which I don’t know if her family spotted (I think I saw the clues more having worked in mental health) she was beginning to have some minor grandiose thinking ect anyway I went along with it. She started to ring me a lot randomly about random things boy problems business plans .We were meeting a lot . She left a voice message sounding in distress saying someone was following herr but I was asleep then out of no where she blocked all contact with me, she had told me I wasn’t there for her (I had being going through some problems too but I had always tried to see her when I could so I was pretty down from this. 

Anyway a couple months go by and I couldn’t get in touch with her, I spoke to her sibling who said they were having issues with her and they couldn’t get through to her and I new this was only going one way and sure enough she was back in hospital after the police found her hiding in a horse stable at one of her friends. She is clearly in psychosis again although not as bad as last time and has lost weight again. She escaped hospital and ran home where her parents then did the same as last time and pleaded she was okay to be looked after with them, problem is the entire family are quite against chemicals and don’t believe in medication so they don’t realise how badly she could do with it. I understand it’s distressing for everyone including the subject having to be in a mental ward but sometimes it’s needed. She is to unwell to know she needs the help and won’t take meds or see a doctor and her parents don’t seem to be offended this but I can understand they are probably also in distress

I refuse to lose this girl and I don’t know what to do I believe at first she might have undiagnosed bipolar and the stimulant / separation with boyfriend triggered the mania however now I am starting to think it’s paranoid Schizophoaffective disorder / manic bipolar 

Doesn’t really matter either way as she won’t take meds :(",19May2019,2
67,"Of course it's infuriating to see someone faking a  mental illness or how bad it is. It's downright disrespectful... Ugh. 

BUT, I was thinking. ""Why?. Why do you feel the need to be branded as 'mentally ill'?."" 

I could be wrong but here's what I think.

I think most of these people DO have an issue, but either they can't figure out why they're miserable, or they feel that their problem isn't ""good enough"" or ""serious enough"" for people to have compassion or empathy towards them. So they seek validation, empathy, and compassion from other people to make up for the lack of validation, empathy or compassion they aren't receiving.

They don't even feel it's a problem worth validating themselves. I think they hate themselves and feel worthless because they're miserable and feel guilty and unfit to feel compassion on themselves, and since no one is recognizing their problem, and they don't feel worth something, they feel they have to create a problem worth recognizing. And a problem that is easiest to claim is mental illness. Because no one can just take one look at you and disprove it.

These people probably have an undiagnosed problem that isn't usual, that is confusing, embarrassing, or that is traumatic but don't know why. They don't realize that they deserve just as much care as everyone else.

Some hide behind mental illness to give themselves and identity, because they have too hard of a time creating their own. Which is another problem, regardless of whether the person is faking or not. This issue more relates to kids, or teenagers, but some adults I assume as well.

I could go on but that's generally what I think might be happening with the people who do this.

What do you think?",19May2019,80

74,"(19/F) About two months ago, I was hospitalized for attempting suicide via walking into the busiest street in town and getting run over. I told myself I wanted it to be as painful as possible so that someone could witness a fraction of the pain I felt. Luckily, friends found the suicide note and called campus safety. Campus safety got me to the hospital. 

My journey started online as a sexually exploited child when I was 13. Lonely, I went into a guild on some stupid game full of adults. They were cool, until they started offering me stupid small things like in game gear and gift cards in exchange for explicit things that a 13 year old wouldn't understand. I only realized what that was by the time I was fifteen, and it hit me hard. I started to hurt myself, wanted to die, but above all I kept quiet about it. I began to get professional help after a visible panic attack in the midst of a class, got meds, all that.

After my hospital visit I was diagnosed with PTSD. I knew in my heart I had it, but I never wanted to because I didn't feel worthy of it. I felt like it was for soldiers and heroes.

I got horrible grades my whole first semester of college because I struggled so badly with it, and this semester I improved but not nearly enough. My parents are nuclear now as I'm home for the summer, but they don't know that PTSD is part of the equation. They never knew anything of my situation.

Nothing came of it at all, but this was around the point my wife would make weird comments. She would say people in our town were talking about her and knew things that nobody should know but only knew because our neighbor was spying and telling everyone in town our conversations, she could tell by looks that they knew info about her, etc... At first, I wanted to believe her but it was really outlandish stuff and very benign, like someone knew what we had talked about having for dinner for example. We have had our ups and downs over the years, but we worked through them and i love her. When this started happening, she would try to pull me into the paranoia so she could justify the behavior. It made me crazy chasing after phantoms. I would ask people if they actually heard rumors, and they haven't of course. Eventually I started to see relationships with her friends deteriorate. She would believe they knew about it, but they didnt...and then she would not trust them anymore and sever the relationship. She started to bring other people in my life into the conspiracy, like my sister. For years, my sister has been spying on us and sharing information with everyone. It practically destroyed my relationship with her, it took years to partially fix it.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually I started to acknowledge it as a mental disorder and I thought she would take it better if I pointed this out. Boy, I was really fucking wrong. She berated me, said she hated me, and just tore me to pieces. I went to a therapist to help me deal with this...because she didn't want help, and she even got mad at me for seeing a therapist.

&amp;#x200B;

Things got really bad between us with lots of fighting. One time the fight was so bad, I got up in her face (not physical) and she pushed me and started beating on my chest. I told her I would call the cops, and she didnt believe me...I did it, and they had to take her in. One of the hardest things I ever had to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I felt so lonely and depressed, that I had a crush and wanted to have an affair. Long story short, nothing ever happened. She brings it up now as extra fuel for reasons I am completely untrustworthy. Even though I thought about it, I have been completely faithful to her though 22 years of marriage. She tried dragging us to marriage counseling, it was a shit show because she would only talk about my potential infidelity...but everything to do with her mental health she would not acknowledge, I would bring it up to the therapist, and it never got any traction.

&amp;#x200B;

One morning, I told her that if she didn't promise me she would seek counseling that I was going to file for divorce that day. She promised me and I thought everything would be ok for once. She went to counselor but apparently didnt even talk about the paranoia. She stopped completely talking to me about it, so I thought it was taken of. I was trying to respect her privacy by not drilling her about therapy. Just wanted to move on at that point.

&amp;#x200B;

She then told me she wanted to start over by moving to a new city, we built a new house...in the back of my mind I wasn't sure she was better...but she wasn't talking about it anymore, so I took a leap of faith.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward a year or so, we live in our new house. I am actually fucking happy, we are seem close again and even have sex occasionally. On mothers day, she sends me this obscure text the night before asking me to move my car down the street for her mothers day gift and to not ask her about it. Out of love, I did it and it was tearing me up inside not asking her... The next day I can stand it anymore and ask her, she says it so the spy equipment in the car can't that the neighbor from a different town cant pick up our conversations because its parked down the street. I absolutely fucking lose it. It the same pattern again where I feel overwhelmed and hopeless. This woman I married thinks I don't love her, that I lie and that I want to betray her by making her go to a therapist. And then when I talk about divorce, she says I am horrible for wanting to do that because I am tearing our family apart.

&amp;#x200B;

This makes me feel like a shell of a person, and I can't deal with it anymore. I want to be happy again someday, but I don't know what to do. My family was town apart when i was a child from divorce. I don't know my dad, and barely talk to my mother...she has been divorced 4 times. I don't want to be them. I don't want my two children to hate me.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, my wife is a Type 1 diabetic...has bad health issues and she hasn't worked for years. Before all this happened, we agreed to have kids and she wouldn't need to work so she could take care of herself. She is good mother, but the kids are completely unaware if her issues. Its hard for me to be a good dad and be present because of all this.

&amp;#x200B;

Can anyone give advice on how I can get her help? I have looked into WI laws and it doesn't seem like there is anything that could help me \*make\* her get help.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR...My wife is paranoid and tearing me apart because she won't get help.",19May2019,8

In October two years ago I tried to kill myself after a bad breakup with a bad person, which was the culmination of a depression which probably started when I was about 14 (I'm almost 23) but tbh I can't really remember when it exactly started.

I've been in and out of therapy all my adolescent life but have never been on meds, and really don't want to be. I have an active social lifestyle that anti-depressants might affect and I really don't want that to happen, although I really don't judge or want to put any negative on those who do take meds, you are all saints.

Up until now, there's always been something i could point to that was making me unhappy, like my life at home or a breakup or being fat. But I really don't think I'm any of those things at the moment.

I almost feel like I don't deserve what I have and that's stopping me from really enjoying it. But I'd love to hear any and all hypotheses, particularly if someone has a similar story.

I am 22 years old (M), who’s gone through enough in life. From my fathers physical and psychological abuse to myself and watching it done to my mom, to being cheated on twice, and moving across the country I feel like I’ve come a long way. A few years ago when I began college I was in a deep state of depression and had tremendous anxiety mostly in relation to my parents’ divorce getting finalized and all of the police involvements after I caught my father cheating and called him out for it and was diagnosed with a form of Bipolar disorder.

Fast forward to now.

Many of my friends who I left behind in my hometown fell away and my new life living with two of my best friends and having a small circle has really helped, but this morning I’m hurting. I woke up and instantly started crying and I don’t know why. I don’t know if it’s because I miss them, or I miss my family or girlfriend, I’m just so sad and cannot stop the tears flowing and I can’t go through days like this. They happen from time to time and it effects my ability to be with other people and I am very much an extrovert. I don’t know if anyone else wakes up and is so uncontrollably sad they don’t know what to do. 

(I am not currently on meds and haven’t been for sometime, mostly out of personal choice because I’ve never found they help much)

88,"I’ve been struggling with anorexia and bulimia since I was 12, and recently I had a bulimia relapse after about two years of being almost ED-free. A big part of the problem is my body dysmorphia, which is at its most intense when I see myself in pictures. When I look in the mirror, I can be pretty confident and content with my body. But seeing only a single picture of myself (even if I’m a really tiny figure far in the background) I see something totally different. In most mirrors, I look like a grown up woman with a fairly tiny body. In pictures I see myself as a very chubby 13-year old girl with hair that looks like a few black noodle strands being glued on my head. It’s an awful sight and I already start to panic when I notice someone taking a picture of me. I really want to work on my eating problems, especially because the image in the mirror sometimes looks like she shouldn’t lose any more weight. But then I see a picture of myself, which totally ruins the whole motivation to get better, because I convince myself to keep losing weight as that girl in the picture definitely needs to. I tried to tell myself that it doesn’t matter how I look in photographs, as long as I am satisfied with the image I see in the mirror, but I can’t seem to let it go.

I’ve had shitloads of therapies in the past, among which therapies surrounding this body image topic. But I’ve never reached a point to see myself as I am in any kind of reflection (from windows and mirrors to pictures and videos). I know that the whole seeing yourself uglier in pictures is something many people suffer from. I just really need to know how to fix it, or how to find out what reflection of myself lays closest to reality.

Do I enjoy school? My friends? I have no clue, I don't not enjoy it. Maybe it's just the depression making everything numb, but I don't even get annoyed or angry really. I don't really have any political opinions either. I don't have any hobbies, even though I've tried hiking, a few sports, volunteer work, and a few other things to try to find a hobby.

91,"I've been seeing far too many posts from the youth regarding ending their life!  I've lent an ear to most of them because I've been there, still am.  With that being said, I share my pain/story with them, confirm that their feelings are valid, healthy coping mechanisms and a multitude of resources.  
They always end up thanking me for listening but  refuse/make excuses claiming that they can't.
My question is for the youth of reddit:  have someone there to listen and deny any of their advice, were you making excuses to stay feeling that way or were you seeking attention?  
Either way it doesn't matter and both should be taken seriously, because far too many teenagers, even younger are literally taking their own lives.
I read posts and chat with these teens and ask them if they've talked with their family about their feelings.  The ones that respond mostly consists of them whom did open up and their family down plays what they're feelings by saying; you have nothing to be sad about, people have it worse than you, you're just lazy.  Maybe they are and maybe they aren't, either way they're seeking attention in an unhealthy manner that needs to be addressed and not brushed off.  I lost my brother to suicide and he chose not to reach out because like many of the responses I get they feel like a burden because of the things they've been told and learned in society; Be a man, Real Men Don't Cry, what you're feeling isn't real, and most importantly the stigma; mental health issues are not always taken seriously, so people figure there's no point in asking for help because then that makes them ""crazy"".  
If you're going through this please reach out unlike my brother, I want you to know... you're worth it, you're feelings are valid, you're not alone and you're loved!  I'd also like to mention that you are far too young to grasp the concept and reality that it truly is a permanent solution to a temporary problem (you're brain is still developing and I have a hunch a lot of it is the period of puberty being a confusing time) the good news is, it will pass.  Also, you're ultimately passing your pain onto your loved ones whom end up blaming themselves if you didn't even seek help or talk to them bc it makes them feel like that person felt unloved which couldn't be more untrue.
You have your whole life ahead of you, with endless possibilities and a multitude of things to look forward to and experience.  Don't let your thoughts define you... fight through it and use your pain to help someone else who's struggling.",19May2019,8

Age 7: ADHD, Generalozed Anxiety Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Short Term Memory Loss. 

Age 13: Manic Bipolar Disorder, PTSD 

Age 16: Addictive Personality Disorder, Unidentified Tic Disorder NOS

Age 18: Borderline Personality Disorder. 

Through my years of treatment I've been on loads of medicine, they don't help. I don't have my list but it's quite a bit and I will personally say f*ck Adderall and f*ck Zoloft. 

I know through research that a lot of these disorders line up with each other and a lot of them can be encompassing diagnosis (ie Borderline Personality Disorder).

I don't know many people who ""end up"" with so many disorders and am currently out of therapy doing it on my own at the time.

93,"Im a 17 year old in high school, and since everyone around me has a job and I dont, I feel incredibly guilty about it.

Friends and other people around me make jokes about how spoiled I am etc. etc.  Thing is, its not like I take advantage of my parents generosity or act like the sterotypical ""spoiled rich kid.""

104,"I’m not even sure if this is the best place for this. Sorry. 

Talking about my mental health, as well as other people talking about their’s, makes me nauseous. I can’t help but compare my situation to other people and either think I’m pathetic for feeling the way I do, because they have it worse, or I think I’m defective when their situation appears better than mine. I can’t win. 

I feel invalidated if I believe someone else is struggling more than me, like I have no right to feel the way I do. At the same time, I think I’m a failure when someone else seems to be doing a bit better. I know I shouldn’t compare my situation to how other people are doing, because everyone’s recovery is different. Also, someone may appear better/worse but I can’t exactly be sure, it’s none of my business anyway. 

I avoid movies about mental health, people with mental illness and I can’t even look at leaflets about getting help with mental illness without feeling anxious. I do my best to talk to doctors about it, because some of my symptoms make loads of things difficult for me. However, I stopped talking therapy after a few sessions so I just see a team of doctors (psychiatrists) every week. I’d rather not say what I’ve been diagnosed with or what my symptoms are. 

I have no idea how to overcome this, because at the moment I’m detained under a section of the mental health act so talking about mental health, and being exposed to other people who also struggle with their mental health, is unavoidable. I’ve been here for months. 

I also believe I would benefit from talking to people with similar experiences if I could just stop comparing myself to them. People could also benefit from hearing about my experiences too. I wish I could change but have no idea how to achieve this. 

I’ve considered reading loads of stories about mental health every day, hoping to get used to hearing about it and to attempt to force myself to stop comparing myself, but I probably need to be drunk to even start doing that. Unfortunately, alcohol is not allowed on the ward.

Technically true I guess, but not the right move in hindsight. After taking a factory job since no one else in the small town wanted to hire me, I became very lonely and even more depressed than before. I experienced a lot of existential depression and had to work through a paralyzing fear of death, which sometimes lead to depersonalization. Intense stuff, imo.

In any case, after 7 months the factory could no longer guarantee enough hours for my expenses at the time, so I made a jump decision to work in a local call center. I'd been avoiding applying there because of my previous call center experience, but felt I didn't have a choice due to income (turns out I earn the same amount as the factory work, so it doesn't make much of a difference anyway).

I've worked there for nearly a month now, and I've decided I'm not willing to continue my employment there. Working in tech support with clients who don't know where their start menu is, then getting yelled and cursed at because *I'm* apparently the one who doesn't know what i'm doing is so incredibly draining, both mentally and emotionally. The majority of my phone calls have been around 30 minutes, the longest being 2 hours with an 88 year old woman who needed me to remote in to her computer just to change the size of her desktop icons.

I won't say that I *can't* do it - I'm actually performing pretty well and am making huge improvements with my metrics - but at this point I'm just not willing to. I'm great with customer service, and can handle getting yelled at as much as the next person, but I'd much rather deliver pizzas, clean houses, work in fast food, whatever I need to than step foot in the call center again.

I don't have a next job lined up just yet, but I have enough in my bank account outside of savings for the rest of the month, and there are a few hiring events in the area within the next week. I could even go back to my previous job, although tomorrow is the cut off date for that.

I'll be moving to a much bigger area with my friend and boyfriend within the next 3 to 6 months so this is all temporary - but I still need to be able to eat and pay rent in the meantime. Is this the right thing to do?

**TL:DR - ** I started working at a call center about a month ago and it's broken me down fast. I don't have a second job lined up just yet, but I have enough in the bank (besides savings) for the next few weeks, and there are a few hiring events going on this week. I can't stand the thought of going back to the call center, and i'm moving in the next few months anyway. Am I making the right move by not going back?",19May2019,2

107,"Depression has fried my brain. I can't concentrate or learn anymore. Despite this, I have really been trying to work for my exams.

I've never done more than 4hr study a day. It's usually more like 2 and often it's nothing. My exam is in 3 days and yet today I still couldn't bring myself to do anything. I'm not even *that* depressed right now, I just feel no driving force to start working. 

I have incredibly high anxiety and feel like nothing below an A is good enough, but then can't be bothered to work.. so contradictory. It feels like my anxiety is either overwhelming or zero.

I deffered some exams, my school is letting me take them uncapped along with people doing retakes in 3 months. I keep thinking that in the summer I'll be able to pick myself up, get a better routine with sleeping, eating, and gym, and slowly build up the revision.a

It's not going to happen.

With the amount of work I'm doing now, I could be doing gym etc anyway. But I'm not. And it's gonna be the same in the summer. Even with 3 months I won't get an A. It's a month per subject. I've had 2 weeks to study for this exam on Wednesday and yet I'm still gonna fucking screw it.

Why can't I just go back to normal? Working an 8 hour day, every day for 2 weeks would have bee  doable for me. And even if I could do that, I just feels like I am unable to retain anything anymore.

108,I posted last week about scheduling my first appointment with a real therapist. She was really nice and asked good questions to help me tall about what causes my depression and anxiety and what was traumatic about my past. I told her about having frequent mood swings and she does think I may have a mild form of bipolar disorder and am exhibiting symptoms of it although it is not bipolar 1 or 2 (there are 4 types and two of them are more mild). I also had a blood test done recently and my iron levels are lower than normal but not so low that I have anemia. I take iron pills but sometimes forget and I feel worse when I dont take them which may contribute to my anxiety. I also think I might have a gluten sensitivity which can also cause anxiety. She suggested that I can try mood stabilizers but I am interested in finding out if low iron and gluten could be making it worse and if I can sustain a low gluten diet and remember to take my iron pills.,19May2019,3
109,"so yep. im not wanting to push anything on it but im just looking for advice.

so for the past few years ive been suffering with goin  from good moods for a week or two then being really low for weeks after. i bought meds to stop this one symptom which i believed was causing me to be sad and for the most part it sort of worked. but after few months of being on it, ive just gone back to being in a real low place. 

okay so it was friday, and my last proper day of school before exams. and one of my teachers made this PowerPoint with everyone's first and last pictures on there (so one where everyone was 14 and then 16). as soon as my came up i got incredibly upset but i held it in. my friend told me to laugh at them but i didn't really know what i was feeling??
i didn't even change that much. but the photo that was used was from the induction day before i started in y10. it was quite upsetting for me as my old name was used and that old name was sort of set of a panic, anger and sadness emotions. i luckily got my name legally changed on december. so whether it was a reminder I'm not too sure. 

i get into maths and i start crying. i just tell my friends ""oh why am i crying for no reason"" as i thought it was silly to cry at a photo. i didn't get better from it. i did stop crying in maths but as soon as i got home i began crying again over it.

i did email that teacher as if i sort of go back into a state of feeling hopeless and eugh it's gonna effect my gcse results. they're going great so far. 

in the past when i first told my teacher (she's more of a support teacher if you get me) she asked me if they were for depression. i didn't want to say what they were for as it's embarrassing cus it was around something physical about me that was probably causing me to go low.

so yeah. im just gonna list what im goin through to see if that helps. 

- pains/grumbles from stomach that aren't from hunger (everyone on the bus is like what the heck) 
- leg pain/tiredness.
- low energy
- general sadness. often cries whenever confronted with what im sad about. 
- i often think that the future is really bleak 
- im gonna fail everything. but that's not as much anymore cus my exams are going fine and i haven't died yet. 
- sometimes i have days when i can talk and be all happy. but other days it's like i can't be bothered and ugh and im too scared to say sentences????? i don't know. my speech changes to whatever mood im in. is it normal????",19May2019,4
110,"Those questions seem to really point towards making sure they are recruiting people who think ""normally"". Now I know, it's a job application and most people lie, and maybe everyone should lie to ""give them what they want to hear"". Personally though, I don't like lying, I don't want to present myself as someone I'm not. But from question one you can tell, those questions are really targeted. Some questions could be symptoms they copy/pasted from the DSM-5, with a scale from agree to disagree. It's really, really annoying at this point.

If I work in customer service, why do you need to know how I feel about life? Why do you need to know my level of motivation towards a specific non work related aspect of existence? Why do you need to know if I'm a happy person in my personal life? Why do you need to know if I'm a manipulator? There was like 10 questions about that, which I found so odd. Ask me about how I handle stress. How I handle fast paced work environments. Ask my about my empathy level. Ask me about my problem solving skills. If you want to ask things more personal, just have a text box and ask people to list their diagnosed illnesses. Would be much easier for both you and me.",19May2019,289

115,"26 year old male in United States.
Ever since I was 18 I have been in a constant state of worry. I’m worrying/stressing as I type this. I grind my teeth all day, I have to remind myself to stop clenching my face muscles. I am irrationally always obsessing that close family members and friends have turned on me and hate my guts. I know none of this is true but I constantly worry about it. I’m afraid of social interactions. I panic when the phone rings. I’m constantly making lists for mundane tasks. I have to plan every aspect of my life in a note book or my phones note app. I can’t look people in the eyes. I check that my alarm clock is set repeatedly before I go to bed. I wake up in the middle of the night to make sure. 
I know I’m rambling, and I’m not asking for a diagnosis. I’ve decided enough is enough. If I was going to seek professional help... where would I start? I don’t have a doctor. Should I just call a random office that’s in my insurance?
Any advice is greatly appreciated. I know I should have this figured out...but I’m tired of feeling this way and the embarrassment no longer feels worse than the actual anxiety.",19May2019,3

I have no plans to hurt or endanger myself, but lately I have been thinking about how nice it would be to not exist, not exactly die, but to just not be me. I'm just tired, I guess. Even though I'm a completely different person than I was then, I feel like I'm letting my past define me--something that makes me feel like I shouldn't be alive. I've kind of (stupidly) stopped taking my antidepressants recently too, so I'm guessing that isnt helping. How do you guys cope with not wanting to be here? How do you find a will to live? How do you convince yourself that you arent your mistakes, and that you deserve a chance at life? Lastly, how do you deal with fear and anxiety of the future?

117,"On so many goddamn levels...

I can have very quick mood swings. I've also noticed that I barely ever feel bad with good weather, only in bad weather. My mood can literally change as quick as the weather. Winter is definitely worse on average than summer. I know this is a specific disorder but I don't really want to go to a doctor and say ""hey I think I have this disorder because I notice my mood changes with the weather, gib treatments now plz""

I have super low energy most of the time. This is actually a newer thing I noticed since I started my current study program in September. I feel like this is a result of high workload + 3h total commute time each day. But I have to say, last year I worked a 9-6 job from September till January and I had very low energy as well. With low energy I mean that I literally can't keep any attention some days after I get home to do some homework, but even when I watch a movie I can only think of sleeping. Next day, I won't wake up rested. In weekends I can sleep until 11am easily. That, or I wake up stressed at 8 thinking I need to go to school. Actually, come to think of it, I'm always a bit stressed out when I wake up, like something just scared me up.

I have a very bleak outlook on life. It's almost like a permanent existential crisis I'm living in. I'm not looking forward to anything in particular most of the time, except having no work to stress about. Vacations are my only savior. But I feel too reluctant to travel somewhere, scared it won't turn out like I hoped it would because my scoial anxiety is holding me back once again and scared about spending my money I'm socially obliged to save for ""more serious matters."" I also don't see a nice future in anything I'm learning in college. I always think about how it's absolutely not important to the human race, at a time where we need every hand to help fight dramas like climate change and corrupt politics. I feel like I'm never doing enough to contribute and I also feel like I'm locked up because I can't do all these things I'm not allowing myself to do. Even when I allow myself, I'll make sure I'll feel guilty as much as possible so that I can regret it for the rest of the year. I hate it.

I also procrastinate to an unhealthy level. So much it increases an already stressful life by about a factor of 9000. I cannot remember the last time I did something on time. I feel like everyone procrastinates but I really suffer under it... I've done so much to try and get better but it never works. Even getting out of bed is always met with ""aah I can surely stay in half an hour longer."" And then it's three hours later and I feel shitty for doing that for the rest of the day.

I have social anxiety. I'm isolated. I have a hard time connecting to people. I'm pretty isolated. I'm scared if missing out and not fitting in, so to counter that I do things that'll never make me fit in. Makes sense right? I finally went to the doctor last year. I still have trouble accepting it. Not because it hurts my self image but because I'm afraid I'm making it up. By now I'm finishing up five months of therapy and I have gained some valuable insights but I feel it was a waste of time and money because I still feel so wrong and shitty all the time.

Sometimes I just feel the need to let out energy. Even though I feel super low on energy. It's almost like I'm very angry and I need to punch three holes through the fabric of the universe. I wanna break things, go on an hour long sprint or something, throw things. my own body feels like a nice thing to completely abuse, overperform physically, completely exhaust... It's scary to see these words but it's a great representation of how I feel some times. Right now is one for those times. Every small annoyance is enough to set me way off, trigger a completely disproportionate reaction. A small itch, misspelling a word for the third time, staying in the same position for a single second too long, not being able to clear my head and calm down, writing a post here that's way too long and knowing people won't read it and that I won't get any help ever... 

I just don't know where to go to with any of this any more. I'm pretty isolated and have no friends or family who can give me advice, or whom I feel close enough to to ask for it in the first place. I feel unable to go to the doctor *again* because I already went there *so that should be fixed and I'm only wasting their time by crying for attention and fuck all of this I fucki g hate it aaggghh*",19May2019,1

119,"I wanted somewhere I could share my story, and my experience with my own mental health anonymously and Reddit seemed the perfect place.  I wanted to get involved in removing the stigma by also sharing my story.

I’ve always been a friendly person.  I’ve never been one to only have the one friend.  I was brought up in a middle class home, perfectly normally.  I’ve always had multiple friends and been really social.  It was hard to keep me in the house growing up.  Staying at friends, or sleeping drunk in a random field somewhere in the area, cinema or just roaming the streets finding whatever fun thing we could do that day.  If I wasn’t out, I was on MSN and Bebo as soon as I got home to chat to everyone.  And if I wasn’t doing that, I was talking to the ‘clan’ on PlayStation battling out a few hours of COD.  

When I turned 15, everything went down hill.  I found out that I was pregnant to my boyfriend at the time.  He wasn’t the nicest of boys, controlling actually.  We talked about keeping the baby, and I wrote a letter to my mum to tell her for her to open the next day.  (That letter was shredded.).  I couldn’t make it one day to go up and see him to discuss what we were going to do, and he told me my only option was to get an abortion or he’d get his parents involved.  

My friends found out and the word got passed around.  Two girls didn’t like the fact I didn’t want to have abortion and started calling me out, telling me I was selfish etc.  I made the decision and I went to the first appointment.  I had someone to chum me to my first doctors appointment an hour away from where I live.  After that, it was hard to get anyone.  There’s one girl who was my rock through that process and I will honestly never forget her for it.  She came up when I was having tests done at the hospital after she found out I was alone.  I made the right decision having an abortion.  I couldn’t look after myself, and the ‘baby daddy’ certainly wasn’t anyone for a child to look up to.  

Not long after that I went on a two week holiday with my apparent ‘best friend’ at the time, and her family.  Well what a shit show that was you guys!  Not only did my friend who took me, ignore me after 4 days, she slept in beside her parents and would leave the caravan before I woke up.  Her mother wasn’t any better either.  Giving me dirty looks and making bitchy comments about a 15 year old.  I ended up calling my parents after having enough of being made to feel like I wasn’t wanted anywhere near the family and I was an embarrassment.  My parents decided to book me a flight home for 2 days time.  It was a long as 2 days and a lot of tears were shed.  When it came to leaving, the mother or my friend did not get up to say bye or anything they hid in their bedroom.  The father took me to the airport with no words spoken in the car, got me to security and left me.

I had my first panic attack at 15, alone in an airport, thousands of miles from home and family not knowing which gate or where the fuck to go to get on the right plane.  My suitcase also got on a different flight from me so that wasn’t their when I got home.  Said friends mother, after they got home, told me parents that they need to get over the fact that “no ones like their daughter”.  A 40+ year old woman saying that about a 15 year old.  Horrible woman who I hope burns in hell with her lank of a daughter. 

After that the panic attacks came randomly, out on a date at the cinema, or a car journey to Quick fit, sitting in my friends house, or at a party.  I went to the doctors and got help but I guess over the years, after being used and mistreated by so many people, I just lost all confidence in myself.",19May2019,1

I hate having aspergers (autism, whatever). I don't like living with it, and everyday I need to put such a heavy filter on my life. There is such a stigma living with what I have, I never wish I was born with it and I feel so insecure. Everyday I genuinely don't feel like I fit in, I wish I was normal.

I'm a very bitter person. Even when I'm not angry, anybody who argues with me or gives me attitude can set me off, and I become worse then the person who set me off. 

I need anger management, I can't keep living like this. I hate myself as it is, and hurting the people around me only makes things worse. Where can I go, or who can I contact to help me manage my anger without telling my parents? I want to take this into my own hands, I just don't want to be like this, and I don't think I'm really worthy of redemption or love at this point.

I can think logically ""i'll never be happy trying to satisfy other people,"" ""i'll be able to make more friends if i actually have some degree of individuality,"" etc, etc. but it doesn't really help.

122,"Hello. I hate asking for help. The reason for that is, what if the problem goes away on its own and asking for help is unnecessary? Or maybe the problem is not bad enough. That there are other people in the world that has much bigger problems and that mine is just a tiny one and that I should just suck it up. This post if really hard for me to write. I don't really know where to begin. I don't know if this is a waste of time or not, but I do not know what else to do. I think this post is what makes it real. That I have been denying that I'm not okay. I always say that I am fine, but I don't know. I don't know if I am. 

As I mentioned, I don't know where to begin. I have thought about talking to an adviser at my school, and I have walked past their office a few times, but I have never quite had the courage to walk in. Because, I don't know what I am going to say. Saying something makes it real, and I don't want it to be. I am fine, and everyone knows that I'm fine. I am the girl in class that is always happy. 

I think I might be depressed? I am not saying that to offend anyone or to fake being sick or whatever might come to your head as a reason. I am saying that because that is genuinely what I think. I read an article about something called walking depression, here is a link for it:    
http://gresik.ca/2012/03/10-signs-of-walking-depression/ 

It is low-grade depression, that most people do not recognize in themselves, but I think I have it. And I hate to say that, because I go to school and I go to work, and there are so many people severely depressed, and I feel that is insulting to those who are worse than me. I want to be fine, and thriving and fun and alive.

If I were to get help, or therapy, I would likely have to tell my parents about it, that being my dad and stepmom, and I do not want to. (I am only seventeen years old) It is a long story, but my stepmom and I do not have the best relationship, and my dad, well, I do not talk to him about stuff like this. I could tell my mom, but that would worry her, and that is another thing I want to avoid. And I do not want to talk to my friends about it, because they also would be worried. My best friend in the world has said herself that she is not good at talking about feelings, so I feel like this is a topic that I should not talk to her about. My point is, I do not know who to talk about this with. I do not know what to do.

I do not know what I want to achieve with this post. Maybe just begin opening up about how I am, to someone I do not know. I think it will make it easier for me to find real help in real life. Thank you.",19May2019,6

I'm going to die here, I cant take it.. it's been less than 5 days and I'm having uncontrollable mood swings because she doesnt listen?!? ALL SHE TALKS ABOUT IS HERSELF, ALWAYS!! SHE EVEN CUTS IN TO TELL A STORY SHES TOLD 100 TIMES.

so I have a very severe mental health condition and also have mixed anxiety and depression, social phobia and adjustment disorder. I have never been able to just walk to the shop because of MANY traumas that happened outside my home and I cannot cope. 

what baffles me is that she has seen me try to hold it together while shopping for food, I actually lose touch with reality. 

but weed helps. it helps me so much, it helps me calm down, stop being so paranoid and think rationally?! I can laugh and be happy but shes decided that she doesnt wanna let me smoke it any more because ""it doesn't react well with aspects of your illness"" followed by ""you can Google it"" BUT...


...


she doesnt even know how to set an alarm on her phone, she has NEVER listened to anything I say about it or has no interest because she wants to be happy herself. OH! and she smokes weed for her insomnia. so, self medicates. but me, someone who ACTUALLY needs it shouldn't use it, no, no way, evil drugs?!?!

I mean this woman has constantly bullied me throughout my entire life to do things I have said I CANNOT DO just because I need to ""grow up"" and/or ""toughen up""

now for the KICKER! My mother is VERY SICK, multiple attempts, being raped by demons, the whole schizoaffective shindig. but my aunt has no idea what I WENT THROGH AS A CHILD BEING ABUSED BY MY UNCLE (WHICH SHE LIVED WITH, WITH ME FOR A TIME BEFORE HE DRAGGED HER ACROSS THE KITCHEN BY HER HAIR) and acts like nothing bad happened to me (even though she left WAY BEFORE IT GOT WORSE AKA LOCKED IN ROOM, REFUSED FOOD, MADE TO SHIT AND PISS IN CUPS) AND WHENEVER I TRY TO TALK ABOUT IT SHE JUST SAYS ""NONONO, that didnt happen (uncles name) loves you, he cant understand why you dont like him"" and shit like ""he worships the ground you walk on, always has""

it's almost as if only my mum can be sick and noone else in my family. I'm getting NO SUPPORT FROM THEM AT ALL AND I FEEL SO ALONE. IM GOING TO DIE HERE IN THIS HORRIBLE TOWN WHERE EVERYONE WHO WBER HURT ME IS, I CANT LEAVE THE HOUSE AND SHES BULLYING ME TO LEAVE PASSIVE AGGRESSIVELY.

the only reason I'm here is because I was almost homeless (I stopped going to work and laid in bed for a year basically until I had no choice to leave (also the leak)) 

I'm absolutely fucking done I cannot be here, my whole family are sociopaths and my uncle is a psychopath (nah, for reals tho, noone believes me until they meet them)

125,"This is going to sound weird, but there's a couple of things I don't  think I've ever felt, and I don't know why. As far as I remember I can't  remember being happy. Like I smile/ laugh when I hear a funny joke or  something happens that should make me feel happy, but I don't feel any  different to normal. It's mostly the same with being sad too. Like I'm  writing this out now, and my eyes are kind of watery, but I don't feel  different to normal. Only I do remember feeling sad though, and it was  when I felt like I let someone down, but that was a couple of years ago.  I don't think I've felt sad since. This whole thing makes me feel like  I'm always putting on my emotions, but I don't think I'm doing it  conciously, like I laugh and cry when other people aren't around but I'm  don't know if I'm putting them on for myself. And If I'm not putting  them on for myself then what is going on. I do get other things like I  feel worried and excited, but they kind of feel the same, and I'm don't  like either of those feelings. Same with sexual pleasure, like I do the  whole masturbating thing because I feel like I need to, but I haven't  felt anything particularly strong from it since the first time, and it  didn't make me feel good. In fact I didn't but in a way I kind of did  because it was different. Even with food, there isn't really food I  like, it kind of seems to me like there's food I don't dislike and food I  like, but I think I used to actually like food. And with love, I don't  even know if I've felt like I've loved anyone before, like my parents do  so much for me and they love me to bits but I'm not sure if I love  them, to be honest I'm not sure if I know what love is. Even with stuff  like crushes, I think it might be something I've done because I felt  like I needed to to fit into the school environment, because I didn't  feel any different about those people. I'm not sure though. I've been to  the doctors a couple times for different mental health stuff and they  haven't really helped, so I was going to keep off that until I moved to a  different place and got a new GP. Sorry for the long wall of text, and I  won't reply immediately after this because I'll be going off to bed. I  know this is probably pretty weird, and I've never heard of anything  like this before, but I really do just want to feel things like how  people describe them, because I really feel like I'm missing out.

I've pretty much posted this word for word in mentalhealthuk, but I feel like getting to more people who can try and help is better.

126,"I'm really struggling.

For the last two days I've been in bed which isn't normal for me. 

There are so many things I enjoy &amp; I know those things have made me feel better in the past. So today I told myself I was gonna try &amp; do something.

I started watching a show on Netflix. Not even 5 minutes in I'm bored &amp; angry. Tried to read a book. I read a couple of sentences &amp; couldn't focus. I listened to maybe 2 songs on Spotify before I was bored of that aswell. I tried to play Minecraft which I love &amp; spent only 5 minutes on it.

So after feeling no pleasure from anything I decided the only thing I was capable of doing was going to sleep &amp; I woke up feeling even worse.

What is the point of doing anything if there is no positive result. If I can't even focus. If I can't feel pleasure.

I don't want to be like this. I want to feel ok. I want to wake up tomorrow and hopefully I'll manage to go for a walk or something. But if a walk doesn't do me any favours I know I'll come home frustrated and lost.

Any advice please? I can't go another day staring at my walls dwelling on my situation. And to top it off if the days weren't bad enough I have to hear voices every single night so I hate going to sleep because I know that it will happen.",19May2019,3

No, really, have I actually gone fucking CRAZY? I know that going back to the hospital isn't very convenient right now. Next week is finals week, the week after that is when I graduate middle school. Gosh, I can't wait to leave this fuckass hellhole of a school. It was one of the reasons why I went to the mental hospital in the first place.

I think it would be good for me to have some time away from such familiar surroundings to clear my head and focus on reducing my flashbacks.

She's planning on leaving home to chase after some guy who's not her boyfriend who she used to have a toxic relationship with. She cheats constantly on her boyfriend, with my classmate, and with me. 

She constantly makes references to death, and seems apathetic, if joy welcoming of it. 

Recently she's been showing an interested in dead things, sheep spines, dead birds, a dead rat that she dissected with the same scalpel. She picks them up and dances with them, smiling the whole time. 

She smokes weed everyday. Sometimes multiple times to 'get through' it. (she only told me that one the other day) 

She text me earlier saying that she was feeling good, because everyone she knows is 'just an object'.

I live in a big city so that’s not an issue for me (most of the time anyway). I mean quiet, repetitive sounds. Like someone fidgeting, biting their nails, drinking, eating, making weird throat noises (idk what else to call it lol??), notifications from phones, or even repetitive movement in my peripheral vision, which isn’t sound, but still, it just makes me rage. 

I’m not a violent person in anyway. I am quite quiet, well mannered and I speak very gently to people. But, when a sound is irritating me, I turn into a completely different person, it’s actually scary. I have visions of hurting or killing my self, or attacking the person who is responsible for the sounds (which I would never do ofc, but this is such a powerful feeling over something so simple, it’s actually scary). 

Another thing is, that may also help others who experience the same thing or something similar. I was reading a book called ‘understating psychology’ and there was a study (I read this book a long time ago, so I can’t remember every last detail like year of study etc) on whether people can concentrate better if they know they are in control of the sounds around them. The study concluded that people are indeed more likely to concentrate better if they feel in control of the sounds and noises around them, even if there is constant and repetitive sound, if they feel they are in control it makes a huge difference to how well they can concentrate - so I guess another thing that could contribute to my huge amount of rage, is the fact that I know I have no control over these noises and irritants. 

Although that helps gives us an idea of what also may be contributing to the problem, it doesn’t resolve it completely unfortunately. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I’m losing my mind. I can cope with it, it is driving me to insanity. My little sister is the main source of this, because she knows it is my weakness and plays on it constantly. I also have to share a room for her, so it makes sleeping extremely difficult sometimes. My mothers boyfriend also knows it drives me insane, so he also plays on it. Just knowing that they go out of their way to do this honestly is just sending me insane, suicidal even. I need to move out asap. 

I am afraid one day I will lash out because of this. I really hope I won’t, but it just seems to be getting worse and worse. Especially when people play on it over and over again and there’s nothing I can do to stop it without sounding like a lunatic.

134,"i'm sorry if this is messy, i'm not a great writer.  

I've lately been thinking that i might have depression, but am I just dramatic? I feel this way because I have suicidal thoughts and have written some suicide notes and prepared to kill myself.
 But I have been like this since I was eight (now 18), when my parents split, so maybe i'm just being a teen or something. In the two years after that, i gradually lost interest in all my hobbies, stopped horse riding, violin, three sports and lost all my friends. So maybe I've been depressed for 10 years? But idk if an eight yr old can even be depressed. 
For the past five months its been a lot worse in my head and i am scared of myself sometimes. I also either sleep for 15 hrs or not at all. But i think this is just because i am going to be doing school leaving, going to college type exams in two weeks. 
I think maybe i just want attention or something

Why I think I am just dramatic is because i have been doing that typical 'i wanna kill myself' teenager thing so often for as long as i remember that no one around me is bothered when i say it. Maybe i have just talked myself into it. 
I also have no reason to be depressed, my life is pretty good. 
Im also just a dramatic person, like i cry over anything at all and dropping a pen in class makes me panic so much i tear up and start shaking and sweating lol
I also think being on tumblr in those edge lord type communities since i was about eleven until 16 was a very bad influence

144,"Hello, redditors,

I've created a new account so I could post this. I have also sent this same message to my psychiatrist, which he hasn't answered yet, so here I am.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 22-year-old female, diagnosed with Treatment-Resistant Depression, Generalized Anxiety, an Eating Disorder, and Borderline Personality Disorder. Both sides of my family have an extensive history of several mental illnesses, including Anxiety, Autism, Schizophrenia, Bipolar, Depression, other Personality Disorders, and probably anything else you might think of.  To top it all, I'm sensitive to medications, and usually, get bad side effects or reactions.

&amp;#x200B;

It's been a few months that I've been having a weird experience that I barely know how to start explaining. And it's why I've never talked about it before. Sometimes I get a weird feeling, a sensation that makes me feel as if I'm screaming inside my head; it's like I can feel the body reacting, but no sounds, I don't hear anything and I know I'm not saying anything. It's also nothing concrete, if it was a sound, it would be just an abstract scream, it's not telling me anything. It's not even an actual sound. It makes me feel weird, as if I'm floating, a nostalgic feeling, slightly dreamlike, but I know I'm not sleeping. It happens when I'm doing mundane activities, sometimes eating, talking, getting dressed, walking, but not when I'm doing something that demands more engagement or brain power. This is the first time I've ever managed to describe this and honestly, it scares me a bit. 

Alongside this, I feel a heavy sensation in my body and a *swoosh* sound in my ears, which I think could be caused by a change in blood pressure, but it's just speculation. My body feels so heavy it almost feels light, and I still experience a lot of dissociation or derealization. The heavy sensation almost feels like a magnet pulling me from the inside. It's just weird.

I also struggle with a lot of migraines, which are seldom alleviated by any medication, except rizatriptan or an iced gel pack.

At the moment I'm doing ECT (this is my last week doing the treatment) and taking a few medications.

I'd appreciate some insight or suggestions.",19May2019,1

My PCP also said so but I am SO SCARED to take any kind of drug especially when they deal with your brain chemistry. 

When I'm sick I always try natural alternatives and they do work. My immune system is a fortress because of the supplements and herbal remedies I use. No herbal remedies cure my mental health issues though. CBD oil does calm me down and I take echinacea which is supposed to help anxiety but I cant tell if it works because I take CBD with it.

Anyways I'm scared because of side effects. Especially weight gain. I had an eating disorder where I starved myself and lost a lot of weight. Then I gained too much weight back and felt like shit. After a lifetime of hating my body because I was either not skinny enough or too fat I am finally at a place where I am really happy with my body and weight and am on a healthy diet. I am a little overweight but I dont care because I love food and cooking. I am so scared that if I take antidepressants and mood stabilizers that I will gain weight. I should actually lose some weight but am happy where I'm at. Gaining weight would be absolutely devastating because I fought so hard to finally be happy with my body and form healthy diet and eating habits. I also dont like putting chemicals in my body. I know that some food I eat is processed and has chemicals but i keep them to a minimum and try to eat mostly plant based foods and organic meat and eggs and dairy. 

When I'm in physical pain i am even reluctant to take ibuprofen because i know it's bad for the liver. A little physical pain i can suffer through because i know it will go away without needing to take meds. My mental health issues wont go away and i dont know what else to do if nothing else works but I'm too scared that my physical health will suffer at the expense of treating my mental health. What should I do?",19May2019,3
157,"Just want to share my life and concerns

I'm 16 years old and I've been feeling like my life is going downwards since like 5/6th grade. It's not like anything special really happened, I was bullied through 4-6th grade which obviously wasn't good but it was never that bad either. I haven't had many people I could actually call ""friends"" though, at least after looking back at my past. I have like 1 friend I can actually talk to about things and 2 other friends, twins, who I know are open to talk to. Many good friends in class but I don't feel like I can really open up to them, don't wanna change my relationship.

Anyways, I've been feeling down and such since 5/6th grade and it's just become worse and worse, I'm 99% sure that I'm either at least depressed or bipolar. Doesn't help that something big happened a few months ago. Oms explain it like a story :

I have over the past ~3 years often strained my right ankle and about a year ago me and my family noticed that I was walking badly, my right foot falling behind. Eventually we came to the point of seeking help, thinking out was a habit I had picked up after spraining my ankle so often. After a while of no improvements, even with training, the ""exercise doctor"" (don't know the word in English) thought that it may be a damaged nerve. I got an MR scan and it turns out that I had a 4cm big brain tumor, a hella big one. After about a month of distress and deeper depression than before I went through surgery and after just a week i was released from the hospital. Not everything was good news though, I was completely numb (couldn't move) right leg and arm for a while after the surgery, about a day and a half then it recovered over a month or two. The tumor was also an extremely rare kind, I think like seven people in Sweden, were I live, have had it, ever. So the treatment is not decided at all.

In any case, is currently OK. I have no symptoms, on no medication or anything like that. The worry comes from the MR scan I did a month ago, I'm supposed to do it every 3 months but this time they where unsure if the tumor had grown or not so i was gonna do one 2 months later instead of 3, it's in about half a month.

So this shit is gnawing in the back of my head all the time, like my right side could stop working, i could die, i don't know. Even if it's actually fine, this shit was exhausting and I currently only go to school in the afternoon or for important tests because I just can't be bothered. I'm more invested in league of legends, waiting for cyberpunk 2077 news and some random-ass mobile games than school.

My days currently are waking up late, playing games, forcing myself to school for a short short while and masturbating.

I also don't know myself at all. Like I'm not even sure if I'm the one writing this or just a character I've made up in my mind. I feel like I'm just watching things play out from a characters perspective, I barely feel anything at all, I don't know what's real or what I want, what I need or what I should get, I have no goals, no ambitions, I'm maybe suicidal or maybe I just want attention, I just don't know. Maybe I made this post for attention, not expecting anything, maybe, I don't know.

Thanks for reading this mess, might update if I figure out more shit things to say, inga go to sleep now, thanks again.",19May2019,1

159,"I will begin by stating I have felt this way for about 8 years but It has been really bad for the last 4 years.

I can't be bothered doing anything, weather it be going outside, making food and exercise etc. I just watch YouTube all day. 

I can't even be bothered to buy my mum (single mum and done a good job raising me) or family Christmas or birthday presents and just make up pure lies as to why I can't buy people presents (have no money, account been frozen, etc etc) 

I have a very erratic personality, for example I have had two jobs so far in my life, and after about a month in both, I just, as I call it, and It happens a lot with me, ""lost the plot"" on the day and quit on the spot on both jobs (one was 2017, other was 2018) I have an extremely weak mentality, for example anytime anything seems hard I run away, as shown when I was having a bad day in work and just quit. The feeling I just like a big rush then it feels like my mind has just gone, and I have to just quit, it feels like there's no way back, it's hard to describe. It's like I have to self sabotage or something idk. 

I often book flights to another country and just leave telling my mum goodbye and running away for a few weeks.

I lie about a lot to feel relevant and significant when in reality I'm very insecure about my looks and personality. 

I don't have any friends as the ones I had didn't make any effort with me so I blocked them and haven't seen or spoke to them or anybody in my town as I have deleted all my social medias and threw away my SIM card, I do this to feel 'mysterious' and atleast I feel significant as they wonder where I am as opposed to being irrelevant and a laughing stock as opposed to before. (Everyone used to laugh at me not with me, I have never felt respected) 

I have repeatedly made attempts to make friends through my life and people always make excuses as to why they can't come and do something with me etc.

My only passion is football but I quit my team and stopped playing as my passion went for it. I still love football to death but it's like something in my mind just isn't there. Part of me is dying to play it but my mind can't be bothered if you get me.

I don't necessarily feel sad, I just feel mundane/bored/dull, mainly numb. 

Does anyone have any idea what I could be or is it just me being lazy or something? 

I have been like this for so long now and I'm so tired

Thanks for listening",19May2019,3
160,"A little backstory: my dad has been depressed/anxious on and off from when I was 6 until I was 16. Now I’m 21 and it’s started again, only now I’m old enough to realize that it’s not normal.

Currently I can’t sleep because my dad is crying. He’s keeping everybody awake because he’s crying. It’s not real tears either. He’s crying without tears, like a kid would. Not because of sadness, but because he craves for someone tp reassure him about everything he’s anxious about (mostly work related).

This happens every night. My mom is a nurse who has to get up at 5AM every morning, yet here we are. It’s 2AM and my dad is still crying. He’s keeping her awake. She is extremely tired when she gets home from work so she falls asleep on the couch. Yet, when my dad gets home from his job, it all starts over again.

He got through the day. He even has had some fun and fun social interactions. He’s not anxious about today anymore. However... that’s when he realizes he is now anxious about tomorrow. So he craves more reassurance. Well he’s not receiving it because my mom is asleep on the couch. So he starts fake crying again until my mom wakes up to reassure him. Like a small child would do. He just keeps crying for attention until someone wakes up to help him calm down. It’s pathetic.

This has happened almost everyday for the past 5 months, except for fridays and saturdays, because he know he will be free the next day. Then it starts again on sunday. It goes on almost 24/7. He’s also cranky. I’m walking on eggshells and carefully choosing my words cause he might get angry or anxious. He wants everyone to shut up so he can relax. I’m not supposed to talk. My mom has to watch tv using subtitles and the sound has to be off. He does nothing outside of work besides watching the news, watching some tv, reading the newspaper and playing some games on his ipad. If he has to do anything else he gets extremely anxious about it and worries about it for daaaays.

Thanks for reading. Sorry if t was incoherent. It just stresses me out and I get kinda depressed when I’m at my parents house for too long (I’m staying here for some weeks now because of maintenance at where I live)",19May2019,1
