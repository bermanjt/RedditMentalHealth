0,"I feel like I’m now known as the “problem child” to not only my parents but the people around me. All because I have a hard time hiding my emotions, and it’s been a problem with me ever since.

I had this big conflict earlier about life being unimportant to me. I guess since my parent found out, I’ve been treated unlike my other siblings. And I don’t want to say that she doesn’t love me, but I feel so unconnected to her. 

I’m sorry. Posting this probably makes me look like an attention seeker, but I just feel like I needed to let everything out somewhere.",03Nov2019,2

2,"Im obsessed with her and even though I understand that it's mainly the emotional intimacy I miss, I still feel love for her/ pain because she doesn't want much to do with me. Its been 6 years and I should've been over her long ago. I need to move on and feel stuck, the last time I saw her I got excited like a puppy to see her and it didn't matter to her.

3,"So I’ve had a friend for about a year and a half, and a few weeks ago we were talking and I ended opening up about my mental illness and ever since then talking to her about it had helped me come to terms with it

However about a week and a half ago she started ignoring my messages talks to me in person so now I’m terrified I’ve turned her away from me, I think talking about my problems to her have made her see me as pessimistic downer who only talks to her when I need cheering up

I was thinking of trying to message her again at some point today to try and get rid of any bad blood between us but I’m scared I’ll just make things worse so what should I do?",03Nov2019,1

9,"so my mom has mental health issues that go back id say to her childhood along with traumatic events throughout her adult life. For the majority of my life she's been an alcoholic, she went to rehab and was clean for less than 1 year. She's also married to an alcoholic who also went to rehab with no intent of quitting. He is good to her in that he doesn't physically abuse her like all the other men have and he has money which is what she saw, other than that they only have drinking in common. I know that she uses alcohol to self medicate and it has put her in the hospital multiple times but she is convinced that it wasn't because of alcohol. she denies that she drinks when it is so obvious that she's plastered the majority of the time. she goes on Facebook and is constantly posting about politics and random shit about her daily life. that's all she does, Facebook and drink, and I'm not exaggerating because she doesn't work. If she walks outside of her house she will let everyone know on Facebook. She has too much pride to admit that she needs help and see's treatment as a bad thing only for crazy people, like many in her generation do. I want to talk to her about seeking help but I don't know where to start. I know that if something is not done soon the bottle is going to put her in the grave. The rest of my family is prideful and sees therapy as a bad thing even though I go to therapy and am the most successful person in my family.",03Nov2019,0
10,"honestly I don’t even know how to word this in a way that actually gets the point across. it’s just been a constant feeling over the past few years and I feel like I’m just constantly going down without motivation to get back up. I look back on myself just a year ago and as a normal teen would, I’ve changed so much. except the more time passes, the more I feel like it’s really just me who cares about anything I do. I haven’t made a new friend in years and I’m too scared to go out with the friends I have now. I feel like even in regular conversations with people I’ve known for years, I’m always going to say something wrong or something too far. I don’t have anyone I’m truly comfortable around and it’s a repeated cycle of wanting to do more, wanting to meet new people, wanting someone to talk to, but never feeling like I’m truly worthy of doing anything and just end up staying by myself in the end. I get irritated at every small thing and yes, I know that’s normal. But it’s to the point where some people and family have gotten offended by it. Everything I do is just a nuisance to people and I want to stop and just be a nice person, to make people feel good but I can’t bring myself to just confess how I actually feel to people. It’s a constant case of feeling happy for a while and then feeling completely out of control and sad for weeks. I feel like every thing I do is worthless because in the end today is the same as yesterday and tomorrow won’t be any different. I guess what I’m asking, is this the classic case of being a teen or is there something wrong? I used to be an outgoing person who was able to comfort people but now every time someone comes to me for advice I can’t even bring myself to feel anything, much less give heartfelt input even though I want to.

In January of this year, I started to regain some negative thoughts I had casted away for years out of the blue. I thought it wasn’t a big deal, and that it would go away. Turns out, they haven’t and are still a problem for me to this day. It’s eating me up inside and i don’t know what to do, I’ve tried everything I can to dispel them but they always seem to come back stronger. The best way I can describe it, is my inner monologue voice randomly spouting insults or have a negative view about the people I interact with, even my own family, even the people I care about the most. Even the person that’s helped me get through life the most, I find myself saying things in my head that I don’t mean or not feel at all. And it’s degrading statements too. I hate waking up everyday and that voice out of nowhere coming and repeating those same statements over and over again. Or when I’m not in a good mood or something happens, my mind immediately jumps to insulting or saying degrading things about the people I care about, when I don’t feel that way at all. It’s especially annoying when I’m having a great time or moment and they come out of nowhere to ruin it and remind me my thought process isn’t fine. I especially hate it when those thoughts use my ego to boost their effect. (I’m not an egotistical person, but I have my moments) I have better control of them now, and I do plan on seeing a therapist, but I’m not sure what to do now or how to get rid of these thoughts. What if therapy doesn’t work? What if I have these thoughts for the rest of my life? I need advice.",03Nov2019,1

I have bipolar, schizophrenia, N Tourette's.

I also have depression N anxiety with highs N lows, at best.

My chest pounds deeper in cutting these pulsating lines.

Cuz I'm thee only mad one if I say compulsively:  ""I'm just fine?""

Heh.  ""Just fine,"" indeed.  Just grind N plead.
Just bind N bleed thee obscene, green greed.

20,"Back in high school, I was small and skinny, had ADHD, and undiagnosed Dyslexia.  I got picked on a lot for it.  People always said I couldn’t take them in a fight and whatever.  It fueled my narcissism and I always had negative thoughts.  I dreamt about beating or even killing some of the kids that bullied me.

However, what held me back from committing such an atrocity was that most kids at my school were actually nice to me.  I was kind of a loner because I didn’t really have any close friends, but I honestly think that if I didn’t have people that truly cared about me then my narcissism would have drove me to become a villain.

If people aren’t scared of me, I’m scared of them and that’s how it’s always been. Life is shitty because every time I’ve ever tried to date someone they’ve ended up saying they dated me out of pity it hurts to know I’ll never be loved by the one person I truly and in love with who has been my muse for a year or so now. I wrote about him in a journal and it’s bad bad stuff. The police have been in contact and I’m not allowed near him and it’s eating me alive. I had to drop out of public school to do online so I don’t do bad things to him or myself. Anyways I feel like I have two people fighting in my head and one is me the other is an evil side that wants to kill my true love and do really really bad things and say mean things and kill myself.

27,"So, for the past month my sleep schedule has been abnormally strange. I’ve had times when I go to bed at 5am because of partying or just late night outs, that’s normal. Recently this all changed, I usually go to bed at 11pm but since moving to the states from Jamaica I haven’t been able to sleep until 7am or whenever there’s daylight (No i’m not scared of the dark) From just processing how my body feels it seems that I only get tired during the day, almost like if I was working a job with a night shift. Yesterday I told myself I was done with this because I hated missing the entire day and events so I decided to 100% go to sleep at latest midnight. I laid in bed from 12 to 3 FULLY awake while closing my eyes and trying my hardest to relax and fall into atleast a nap. I figured I wasn’t tired enough so I made some food and went into my office where I turned on some subtle lights to make me sleepy and watch a calm youtube video. Before I knew it, it was 7am. At this point I thought it was best to push through the day tired so when it’s night time I could fall asleep. It’s nearly 10pm and once again I am completely awake...

90% of my week is inside the same room, same four walls typically alone only leaving for bathroom and maybe a bite to eat once a day possibly. Family don’t bother to contact me since I left and pretty much every friend I have has disappeared because I was not good enough for them.  I get out twice a week if lucky but only for an hour or two. 

So much frustration and anger to those I don’t wish it to. Paranoia, anxiety and depression never shut the hell up driving me crazy nonstop. Always reminding me how much of a failure I am to say the least. No one wishes to hire such a terrible person like me and I don’t blame them. I can’t help anyone that needs it. I’m just the biggest burden and parasite to anyone that knows me. 

It’s not fair! I’ve always tried my best in life to be the best I can and help anyone in need and what do I get in return? More mental health issues then I can count. Being a shitty person and so much more. It’s not fair!

So ever since i can remember i've always hated my face because of the big bump in my nose. I don't know what to believe now because everything torments me(especially lighting and my head angle and position). When i'm in normal lighting my profile looks normal but when i'm in strong light like the sun i look like a totally different person because of my profile. It is so severe that i make sure i keep my head up straight to make my nose look ""shorter"" and i never hump my back when i'm sitting down doing homework or something.

I hate it because when i see people with a similar nose to mine they look the same in different lighting or however they are positioning(their neck, head) they look the same. Despite this i've been told i'm attractive even my male friend rated me an 8/10. But i don't care what people think because that's what they think, not me, i'm very ugly and i'm always so self concious everywhere i go (i'm to shy to upload a picture of how i look but i would do it maybe in dm)",03Nov2019,6

I feel like a constant fuck up. I can’t do anything right. If I’m not important enough for my best friend to help me our, where does that leave me? 

It’s a struggle to get out of bed and go to act and put on a happy face because I work in customer service.  But I’m fucking exhausted.

Most of the time when I’m speaking to someone, or having a conversation I imagine them instantly being hurt by me. Weather it’s kicking them in the head or punching them, or whatever object is around. I just imagine it and it makes me sick inside. I would never hurt a soul. I would take my own life before I ever injure another person. When i imagine and see it happening in my mind,  I shutter. Sometimes I think it’s because of an evil force (check my page)

I guess you could say I was... snappy?

I don’t know.

My parents have seen many psychologists without me, about me. Constantly talk about me. Make me feel like garbage. But the point is I hate conflict or confrontation.

I have mustered the courage to talk to them and even asked politely they insist on me going to a program without my input. They don’t value what I have to say.

42,"I started seeing her a few months ago. I was using hard drugs and I was doing things I didn't want to be doing and I was scaring myself. I saw it ending badly if I didn't get help.

Today she told me she thinks I am ""done."" That I've done the work and that there's not much else for us to do and that I could stop coming to therapy.

In some ways I feel like she might be right and in other ways I feel like there is so much more that we haven't even touched the surface on. I do think she's given me some helpful insight, and I feel like lately when I get to therapy I don't have a lot that I want to talk about. Not that there isn't stuff I could talk about, I just don't feel like diving into it all and she doesn't really push me.

But on the other hand, I don't feel like much has actually changed for me since I started. I am not using hard drugs at the moment, but I don't really feel secure in that staying that way. I am still feeling very unsettled in myself and my relationships and my life. I am still self-destructing in other ways. And I just don't feel like I'm doing as well as she thinks I am.

I told her that I didn't want to stop therapy, so she cut me down from every other week to once a month so we could still check in. But I'm feeling all sorts of feelings about this. Mostly, I'm scared, I guess. I don't think I'm ready and I don't feel stable enough.",03Nov2019,1
43,"Hey y’all I was just kicked out of my house after 19 years of enduring emotional neglect from my mother. I was sexually abused by a family member repeatedly around the age of 7.  My two sisters were sexually abused at early ages as well. Our father, their rapist, was imprisoned, my rapist was never convicted nor outed. I still see him on family holidays and whenever I go to my grandparents house to visit. I was diagnosed with PTSD, depression and severe anxiety this year after my mental health became so unstable that I couldn’t hold a job.
Before I became unemployed, I told my mother I was depressed and she said I had no reason to be and brushed it off. This is when our relationship became rocky. I didn’t talk to her much about anything, but I still loved and respected her. I thought she was right, that I should feel guilty for being depressed with all the things that I had. 
Then when I lost my job I started experienced physical anxiety symptoms like uncontrollable shaking and sweating, I was more anxious and uncomfortable than ever before so I chose to tell my mother about being raped and how my mind was becoming too much to cope with in hopes of extra support. She cried and promised to help me. She acted really helpful and amazing for a couple of weeks, telling me we were going to do something about it and she was going to help me find a therapist. I thanked her for everything and I was excited to finally get help.
This is when I was diagnosed. The step after that, for my mother, was therapy. For me, it was job searching and self-reflection. Not that therapy wasn’t a goal of mine, but being unemployed, I didn’t have a stable income and my mother is low-income. I wanted to do it when I was financially stable. I told her this and she told me I couldn’t recover without it, she even offered to pay for it and let me use her car to go, though using her car for interviews was stressful enough because she was always worried about her gas and how long I was going to be out. I decided to hold off on therapy until I got a job and my own car. 
I continued to go to the doctor for anxiety medication, since I believed my most severe issues derived from anxiety and stress, but my mother told me I wasn’t doing anything for myself and I needed to go to a psychiatrist. I was proud of the progress I had made by even opening up to someone.
Here’s what I’ve learned: There is a line between being a danger to yourself and those around you and being an unstable, but insightful, functioning human-being with mental illness. 
There should also be a line between caring and showing concern for someone and trying to “do what’s best” for someone without asking THEM what THEY think is best for them. 
I was a danger to myself on pills, battling suicidal thoughts and constant zombie-like fatigue. My mother didn’t notice, we didn’t talk much unless she was pestering me to better my life. I would have went to any psychiatrist then with how much pain I was in emotionally, I just didn’t have the motivation to ask for help. 
I quit the pills after a few months and I promised myself that I would try every other option before I resort back to those mindfuckers again.
I knew it wasn’t going to be as easy as meditation and mindfulness everyday. Intrusive, suicidal thoughts still lingered, but at least they weren’t being shoved down my throat. I learned about trauma, the effects and ways to cope. I will reiterate, I know this would not cure me. But I do believe the change of focus and energy changed me.
Even if getting out of bed before noon was nearly impossible and all my job interviews ended with me shivering and drenched in sweat, I chose to enrich myself with knowledge for the sole purpose of bettering the quality of my mind and life; something to be proud of right? 
Nope, I was told without a psychiatrist and therapist that I drive to everyday using my mothers vehicle and money, I’m doing nothing with my life. So much so, that I deserve to be homeless.
My mother made me homeless a week ago after causing me a panic attack and screaming in my face so much to the point where I finally told her how afraid of her I am. She came into my room to tell me to stop being so loud when I was crying because of something unrelated. When she came in she saw me having a panic attack and she gave me an ultimatum, either I be driven to the hospital to receive inpatient mental care or I become homeless. I tried telling her that I just needed a moment and that I would talk to her when I was stable. She wouldn’t let me talk and started screaming in my face so much so that I couldn’t say much, she does this whenever she gets even slightly frustrated. I was crying and panicking so hard I barely could anyways. I finally begged her to let me take my things. She asked why I would rather be homeless than ride in a car with her, I thought it was evident the way she was screaming at me and had accused me of assaulting her when I pushed her finger out of my face. She isn’t stable, I told her that and she doesn’t like to hear it. She counted down, telling me I had 5 minutes to pack up my entire bedroom into one trash bag. She continued to escalate my panic attack while I was begging her to stop. 
My question isn’t about whether or not I need therapy or whether or not she was right in questioning my progress, but why would a mother put her daughter out on the streets for being mental ill and showing signs of mental illness? Especially when she invalidated my depression when I first told her about it and only understood when I told her a bit about my traumatic experiences. Of course I relapsed a few times during the time in question, shamefully quitting jobs and flaking out on interviews, in between weeks filled with scheduling job interviews back to back and genuinely feeling motivated.
My goal was to get a job, car and then therapist; am I in the wrong?",03Nov2019,1
44,I lost my sister in 2018...she was shot in her back ..it’s been a long challenging time I was already very depressed before spending 2 weeks in a mental hospital because my school counselor found out through a friend that I wanted to end my life. This was in 2017.. It never went away I don’t want to put my family through another loss but I just don’t care now it’s so selfish but I am so tired of living life feeling like I shouldn’t be here I love my family and my friends so much but it’s hurts so much to just live.,03Nov2019,4
45,"  
Recently, I have been struggling with myself.   
I have developed severe anxiety that not only mentally exhausts me and hurts me, but it is physically tiring and painful. It seems to happen at night more frequently. Probably because I have several hours by myself. My thoughts and mind are terrifying to be left alone with. I do not want to be alone with them.  
It’s a never-ending of having serious anxiety because of my health, and noticing my health is deteriorating because of my anxiety.  
This is not only something that happens behind closed doors anymore. This has affected my outside life quite negatively. I had to quit my job because I cannot handle it anymore. My grades are not where I wish they would be, because I am so exhausted. My relationships are suffering because my mind is falling apart. I feel distant from my boyfriend, yet I have no idea how to even bring the right words together to explain this to him. I have no friends; or at least no friends that I feel I can rely on. I am completely and utterly alone, and there’s nothing I can do about it. I don’t blame people from keeping their distance; I am very mean. I wish I wasn’t and I hate myself for every mean thing that I do. I am mean to my family, and my grandfather especially. I don’t understand why I act the way I do, and I hate it so much. It’s like I have my real self inside of me, but my outside body is on autopilot.   
I often spend my alone time crying. There is a constant war inside my head that I just have to watch happen. I just want it to end.  
Sometimes, there are really good days where I feel like I am changing and becoming me again. They’re usually short-lived, though. I feel like I don’t belong anywhere. I’m entirely unwanted. I am a burden on my family. My mother gets annoyed every time I ask her to drive me, and she gets upset when I do not want to go to my dad’s. At my dad’s house, there is no place for me. I am just a visitor; I don’t belong there.  
Waking up in the morning is just as hard as falling asleep. I don’t understand what is wrong with me. I am always exhausted. Sleeping doesn’t help me rest or recover, it just fast forwards me to another day.  
I can’t seem to figure out what is wrong with me.   
The anxiety takes more forms than just worry about health. I get paranoid, where I need to pace around the house and check every lock. I get anxiety attacks that hurt my chest so much, I think I’m having a heart attack. During the day, I get too scared to even dress nice.   
I just don’t know what to do anymore.",03Nov2019,1
46,"This has been happening to me for as long as I can remember. You know that feeling when you're watching a sad movie in a movie theater, feeling a certain way and reflecting on life in the certain way-- then the lights turn on and your view on everything shifts? I feel like everyday I wake up as though I have a sort of ""filter"" on. It's not so much what happens in the day, as it is how I am viewing these things. Some days seem a bit dull, and others seem fresh and new. These feelings are especially influenced by the weather (I find).

I have had anxiety in the past, and issues with dysthymia. But so far no one has been able to answer my questions in regard to these ""filters"" over my day.

Any clue why I may feel this way?",03Nov2019,13

48,"(tl;dr) Told my Therapist about my wife's drinking habits, therapist considers calling CPS, wife kisses her shit and starts trying to control all aspects of my Therapy. 

A few months ago I finally started seeing a Therapist. I was a victim of severe child abuse, I am an Iraq War Veteran, and my Father recently committed suicide. So it's safe to say that I needed to get help.

I have talked openly about most of my issues with friends and family for years, so I thought I had a pretty good idea of how I would handle Therapy. I could not have been more wrong. One particular Journaling assignment actually caused me to pass out in my office a few weeks ago. I say that to impress that it has already been a hard road and I do not relish the idea of starting over again.

Well one day while in session I off-handedly mentioned my wife's drinking problem and without going into detail eventually during the conversation my Therapist stopped me and informed me that she was almost certain she might need to file a CPS report. After talking with her a while she agreed that if my wife was showing some intent to improve the situating she could consider not filing it.

I tell my wife what happened, she is predictably upset, agrees to look into programs, says she was told she's not an alcoholic, and gives me no end of shit for ""putting her through so much"". But then she leaves our home for 2 while days to stay with her friends and while there decides that I shouldn't see my Therapist anymore. I explain the obvious; my therapist is not a threat, she was thinking of our children, etc.

She doesn't listen to reason and demands that I find another Therapist. I explain how hurtful that is that she would even ask, let alone demand it. And I explain in detail the things I had already gone through with this Therapist and why I was unwilling to do it again. She begrudgingly accepts, but continues to give me shit for going.

So I get us signed up for couples therapy, she goes to 2 sessions with me, then reschedules out next one and tells me that she won't go to another one until I get on some diet of medication so she can ""know she is talking to the real me"" in session.

And then she tells me that I should stop doing my Therapy sessions for the weekdays since the weekends are for family time. I do that but my next appointment they were unable to move so I schedule it as a phone session but she even balks at this! So I had to just cancel my most recent appointment altogether to keep the peace.

I'm trying so hard to get better for myself and for our family, but she just keeps putting down roadblocks and I don't know how much more I can stand.",03Nov2019,17
49,"I’ve been more on the heavily depressed side for several months now... It’s my first college semester and I’m working, after not working all summer because I went to a mental health/rehab facility. Before and during this I made a bunch of new great friends and I got to spend a lot of time with them, the ones from before I spent time with before and after and a little bit on visitation days. 

And with my friends during that time I was living with for 2-3 weeks... and Then saw them regularly at out patient for several weeks, and hung out with my closest friends from the place since then. But now that my schedule is dictated by work and school, and I live kind of a far way from my friends, it’s kind of harder for me to spend as much time with any of them. I count myself very lucky the day or days of the weekend that I sometimes get to see them. 

I also just don’t have as much free time to do the things I enjoy, and even when I do have time I’m typically too tired to do them for very long.
 I dunno I’m just feeling kind of burned out from my responsibilities. 

I’m having some very reckless impulses. I’m denying the ugliest of these because I don’t want anyone else to have their feelings hurt because of my own problems. And I’m still avoiding the large scale impulses such as wanting to drop out or hurt myself so I can be sent back to the facility I was in before. 

I dunno I just really hope that I can catch a break and things can ease up for me soon because I’m not trying to destroy my life. I don’t wanna delay or backslide my progress in any/all areas of my life",03Nov2019,1

i haven’t had a day off in a couple months. i thought i could handle all of this but im having a really hard time juggling everything. 

im studying a major i’ve realized i’m not really interested in. i’ve been going in and out of school. this is my third semester and third major change. i have no idea what im doing and having no days off doesn’t seem to help either. 

it’s putting a strain on my relationship and i’ve realized im suddenly very short tempered. i dont know what the cause is and everything i try to do to be patient, doesn’t help. 

cutting my hours isn’t an option unfortunately, as i’m the sole form of income in my household.

52,"Hello, first-time poster, I have something to share. I'm 19, male, and I cannot stop thinking about my childhood ever since college started (3rd year student in engineering). I'm constantly thinking about how I felt when I was late 9 to 14. When I was 9 to 14, it was honestly the best time in my life. I clearly remember seeing friends and going to other people's houses often for parties or family gatherings. I didn't have a stressful time in school. I didn't have to commute 1 hour to my university every day. I had friends I could talk to daily and look forward to walking on nature trails or being with friends and going to cafes on the weekends with them. But, after 14 years old, something changed. I became more introverted and in my head too much because my parents were not setting up gatherings anymore. Now, I'm finding myself in a constant sentimental state thinking about the PC games I had, how often we used to see our friends (we still do just very infrequently), and how I could go out every weekend because I didn't have to much school work to do. Now, all I do is study and worry about finding an internship. I no longer see friends on a consistent, weekly basis. I remember even in 2006 - 2013 I used to know this girl and our moms would take us everywhere together so we could play at the park or something like that. I terribly miss those moments, and I'm scared they might not come back. My city doesn't feel the same anymore either. I thought college was going to be relaxing but I realized its the complete opposite. I really miss our frequent get-togethers with our friends. I'm just waiting to feel like I'm 9 - 14 again, but I'm scared it might not happen. Maybe something will change after I graduate college. I tend to have a lot of hope but I don't want it to turn toxic either. My parents would get together with people so much more often in the past but now we barely do it.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR - Constantly in a state of nostalgia for my childhood (9-14 years). Want consistent friend get-togethers back but starting to feel hopeless because I'm too ""old"" for it or something like that.",03Nov2019,3
53,"I’m afraid of being alone. Everytime I’m alone, I am numb. The numbness drills into my soul a little more everytime. I can surround myself with people every hour, except for when everybody else is asleep. The only other way to not feel numb is to cut. I love the feeling of cutting. How my body tenses up when the blade first touches my skin, how when I first cut into my skin I have an instinct to laugh. The pain is AMAZING. I can’t stop anymore. I do it almost every night. Is something wrong with me? The people in my life shame me for my mental issues. I opened up to my best friend briefly about the tip of the iceberg of my issues and she just called them weird. My brother thinks being depressed is just whining and that I can get over it. Everytime I’m having a mental breakdown my sister teases me for “pitching a fit” I’m not safe to feel emotion without having a panic attack in my own house.",03Nov2019,3

57,And now for a post so fresh it's still a little bit slippery.,03Nov2019,1
58,"First of all, forgive me (25F) for any mistakes or typos, I'm on mobile.

I'll start by saying this, I'm not the most mentally or emotionally stable person. I have been struggling with the PTSD of severe childhood abuse, separation anxiety from a very bitter and violence custody battle between my parents, I regularly have thoughts of harming myself but I'm currently 5 years clean, almost 6, and I suffer from a really vile mixture of manic depression/bipolar disorder, and anger issues. So please keep in mind that I am not really in the best state of mind while I'm writing this.

growing up I always made the joke that I didn't want to be old. I wanted to be dead before I was old enough for all of my family's age-related health problems to come creeping up on me. This joke eventually took form as me claiming I would commit suicide by 65 years old. Most of my friends and family just laughed about it, and told me that I was overreacting. My therapist however saw it as a red flag. She managed to weasel the rest of my actual thought process out of me, and discovered that I actually have had the desire to commit suicide for many years.

In the last 5 years of my life, things have gotten much better than they ever were. I entirely escaped the abusive side of my family, reconnected with my mother, who was always a shining light in my life, but I was never allowed to be with her, got a decent-paying job, my own place, my own car, and my partner and I live together.

Two years ago I lost my grandmother. My mom's mom, was the matriarch of our family. Now her younger sister is, and her younger sister is on her way out as well, and then it will be my mom. Losing my grandmother was incredibly hard for both me and my mother. The three of us had a very strong bond, and we were all exactly alike. Grandma got really sick, and didn't take care of herself until it was too late. She ended up having an extended stay in a hospital, and that hospital mistreated her and neglected her. She ended up contracting a flesh-eating bacteria in that hospital, and by the time we moved her to another hospital and got across the country to where she was, it was too late. She had to be put in hospice, and we all had to just stand around and watch her die.

This destroyed my mother, and myself as well but honestly it was harder on my mom that it was on anyone else. Her mother was her best friend. They talked everyday, sometimes multiple times a day, on the phone. the news at my grandma's health was failing, as she was on dialysis and was not able to take care of herself very well since my grandfather passed a few years before. so we had made the decision that grandma would move out with us, she would move in with me and my partner, and we would take care of her. I was so excited about it, because I loved my grandma so very much. But after she contracted the bacteria, it was impossible.

Well my mom and I watched her go, I realized that if it had been me sitting next to her and crying about not wanting my mama to leave, I wouldn't be able to handle it. And this was the exact point where my joke about offing myself when I got old turned into offing myself when my mama died.

For the last two years, my mom has dealt with a few different health problems. Every time something comes up, I start worrying about the worst. Will this be the thing that takes her from me? Will this be the end of my life because I can't live without her?

My birth father forced my mother and I to spend most of my life apart, and ever since we reconnected my mom and I have been inseparable. We work in the same place, we live 5 minutes away from each other, and we text and talk every day that we aren't together at work. I honestly cannot imagine a life without my mother in it. I've explained this to my partner, and of course it makes him sad to think that I would die soon, but he doesn't know how to help. I have even jokingly revealed that plan to my mother, and she became very sad and asked me not to do it. I don't want to disrespect her wishes, but I honestly don't know how I could survive without my mom in my life. I know that this is nothing new to society or to humanity at all. Parents are supposed to die before children, and age takes everyone away eventually if a health problem doesn't.

I had a nightmare earlier, about my mom being gone, and me trying to find my friends to tell them. The overwhelming feelings of sadness and heartbreak permeated into my wakeful state. I became depressed for the day and ended up going back to bed and slept for twelve more hours. Which isn't a big deal, it's my only day off. So I probably really needed the sleep. But it got me thinking, that this mentality I have is probably very unhealthy for me, and I'm no longer able to access a therapist because of money problems, so how can I go about changing this toxic mentality I have? I don't want to live without my mother, but I don't want to deny my partner and my future children and other loved ones in my life of my existence before it's time to.

Please note, I am not currently in any danger. I am not currently thinking about harming myself for taking my life. I am in a clear state of mind, and I am coming to The forum asking for help. Please do not feel alarmed, please do not think that I am going to try anything dangerous. I promise that all is well right now.",03Nov2019,17
59,"Hi Reddit community, I am asking for advice...

One of my family members has been dealing with a little bit of anxiety, stress and insomnia. They were never like this before, it wasn't until they had lost their job that trigged a downward spiral about 2 months ago. This past Tuesday night she tried to take matters into her own hands by locking herself in her room.... Thankfully a family member was staying with her at the time, and had a key to the room and was able to prevent her from causing any serious harm.

We took her to the local emergency room, the doctors evaluated her and put her on the 5150 hold (72 hours hold) to evaluate her. The nurses and doctors at this emergency room were very helpful and transparent to us on what was going to happen.

She was transferred to a second hospital, not affiliated with the first one. It was a psychiatric and behavioral hospital for the 72 hour hold. Today is Saturday, so the 72 hour hold is up, and we have yet to speak to the psychiatrist / doctor on her progress. It seemed odd at first, we thought maybe the 72 hours was an evaluation period so maybe there would not be a psychiatrist on site until afterwards? Our family member said that in the entire 72 hour hold, she only speaks to the psychiatrist about 5 minutes each day and he just asks some generic / basic questions. The rest of her time is spent in groups, free time, she's on the phone calling us, she may have had a brief conversation with a therapist.

  
Our family has never experienced this before, so I wanted to ask if this was the proper procedure?? It seems a little odd that no one from the hospital has really given us status updates as to her health, what medication she is taking, when they expect her out, or even spoken to the psychiatrist. Now that the 72 hour hold is up, they have her signing a voluntary stay form? Which we don't know what that means.

  
Thank you!",03Nov2019,3

67,"I’ve (21F) been feeling so depressed lately and I have no motivation for anything. This is a constant battle I struggle with, as I have worked with my therapist on my coping tools and I know exactly what I need to do to feel better.

I don’t get to see her often since I’ve moved away from school and my next counseling appt at school is a month away so that’s not an option.

It just feels so pointless to do anything which I know is the depression talking but I don’t know how to convince myself otherwise. Life just kinda feels meaningless and there are probably ways to make me feel better and not feel like it is but I think I’m scared to be happy for some reason.

They’re separated. When they ask how she is all I can say is she’s fine. It’s like it’s every day there’s something new for her to say to be so mean to me.. I’m over the whole hating her part because of it because it got so annoying I was just so sick of it. Now 5 years later she’s still at it and I am so exhausted from her. She has a new “problem” also.. which isn’t real, that she keeps complaining about to me.. like something I don’t even know that’s happened maybe more than 20 years ago to her.. she is driving me mad and I just need some advice on how to deal with this... please...

70,"I feel rejected. Too many details to explain. But i ended up sitting in my car writting hurtful paragraphs to my boyfriend while laughing loud and hysterically with tears going down my face. It was in no way funny. Nothing about it was funny. I dissociate often, during this time i felt unreal (depersonalization/derealization) as well. Am i experiencing a psychotic break? Im so very stressed lately and everyone is seeking advice from me and want me to help them, while really, im the one who needs help, but no one is there for me.

72,"I talked about issues that I was dealing with to my parents on the phone and I forgot to entirely close my room. My roommate, who usually stays in her room, got out and sat right next to my door and was texting me about my issues. I told my parents that I wanted to seek help from professionals but I do not want to anymore because my roommate will surely document every actions I'll do or things I'll say. 

Before getting in a lease together, I told her which university I was going and to keep it for herself. The thing is that I come from a small hometown and the univeristy I'm applying for is rather prestigious in my country so people like to gossip about students who go there. And it's good gossip when you're doing good, and bad gossip when you're not doing good. 

Right now, I'm not doing as well as I expected and I'm have problems with the language barrier so I've become anxious about speaking in my second language(which I'm studying in). I do not want any in my hometown to know about my struggles, even so that I find it difficult to talk about it to my parents because they will worry to death. 

My roommate used to lie a lot to get other people's attention and I know that she told many people which university I was going to because they've asked or casually dropped it in conversations. I was really angry about it, but everytime I express my disliking, in a non-agressive way but also not so constructive, she gives me silence treatments and voluntarily fails to do her share of the chores.   

After the conversation with my parents she texted me to know how I was going to get help. I did not bother to explain how, and gave short and evasive answers because it does not concern her in anyway. 

I have a lot of friends from my hometown who'll know about it, and as I know extremely well their behaviour, they'll gossip about it and try to get involve so they can gossip more. The gossip does not ""kill"" me, but the fact that people know I have struggles really puts me off and makes me want to stop seeking help.

I’m being really weird with people and I keep thinking they’re like judging me or want me to do something. I’ve also been really emotional and weird at work and I usually get along with everyone there. my coworkers usually talk to me but I feel like they’re ignoring me and it’s really weird because they never do that. I know it’s not just me imagining it too because a boss of mine said something shady about me while I was working. I feel almost like i’m starting trouble but idek how or why i’m doing it. I feel like a chicken, and I feel like other people see it and take advantage of it. the reason why I guess I feel disconnected is because i’m usually not so nervous but idk what’s going on.

I have been recently having issues doing.. anything, really. Even the things i enjoy, (videogames) i cant even bring myself to start one.. instead i just stare at my desktop and then click on youtube and reddit, i assume because they are easy. But i am horribly bored of reddit and youtube as well.. so i am just stuck in a weird loop of inaction.. 

I want to do things, something always catches my eye. Recently it was programming; i got super into it, loved it, and then after a few days i find it almost physically painful to continue doing it, and i drop it. Until a month or so later when i pick it up again.. as i do with everything, ad nauseam, since i was a child. 

I dont know what i am supposed to do, i want to be good at something, specialize in it, have a career and a good life, but how can I if I keep switching things just over and over? I am mentally exhausted yet I cant rest, i have to constantly be doing something.. i dont know what to do. 

Sorry for the jumbled rant, even if no one reads this i think it helped me writing it all out. Thank you.",03Nov2019,3
84,"I’m introspective in an obsessive way. I pick at my nails a lot, I think I do a really similar thing with my mind- keep picking at my thoughts and reasonings until I might actually drive myself crazy.

Self worth for me goes in cycles. 

I think something really negative about myself then question why I’m thinking it in the first place- is it just a justification for self-pity? 

I don’t feel happy. I don’t know what I should be doing or what I’ve been doing wrong all my life. 
Case in point: my response to the earlier lines is: ‘well that certainly sounds over dramatic, look at me craving pity/attention again! you’re just telling yourself you don’t know what to do because you’re too weak to ever solve your issues’. 

Back at square one.

Ever since I can remember thinking about emotions like this, I’ve found myself extremely hard to pin down.

I was an extremely unpleasant and conniving child- threw huge tantrums to guilt parents and siblings that often involved strange forms of self-harm. Extremely manipulative but in an unsuccessful way. If someone hurt me by rejecting me, I would want to reject them harder to make them feel bad about it, not realising that the most damage I was inflicting was on myself. My mum cooked a dinner I didn’t like and I tried to fast to make her feel sorry for it. Of course, that failed. 

I’ve always been extremely selfish and childishly impulsive. Those tendencies are supposed to disappear with age but they haven’t with me. I care far far too much about the little and inconsequential things, and don’t naturally think of the feelings of others. Add in the fact that I find social cues and circumstances hard to understand and it’s no wonder my parents thought I was autistic when I was younger. They took me to a doctor once but we never really got a diagnosis.

But even though I’m in many ways a horrible person, I’m still a self aware one which is the greatest curse of all. Since young childhood (~age 9) I was convinced I was a fundamentally bad and unlikeliest person that would never find love or true friendship. Latter hasn’t happened yet and I’m either asexual or a late bloomer so my probabilities are looking worse and worse :/ The fact that I never tried to change this and instead wallowed I’m self pity (just like I’m doing now) just sort of added to this picture. Morally weak, mean, and selfish. The snivelling selfish coward you see get killed in an action movie by the hero and ridiculed by the audience.

Juxtapose your image of me above with someone who deeply craves self worth and affection from others. I guess if I hate myself other people loving me is like the ultimate validation? I want to be heard, liked, understood. When I was younger I would process bogus extreme political opinions just so people would argue and talk to me. I was an emotionally sensitive child when I was yohnwbr, but only in a way that ever applied to myself and not others. But all that I really want is for other people to like me. 

Anyway, I don’t know how to change or what path to take? Every direction I go in seems to be a futile path- this very post, for example.

Indulging my selfish shallow desires for self pity by writing out a long post about my supposed struggle when the only struggle I’ve ever had is an imagined one that I’ve made exist simply to give myself a more interesting and attention seeking existence. Casting my selfish desires into the internet void.

87,"So I've been seeing a mental health professional (not sure their exact title or qualifications 50/50 counselor or therapist either way they do that for a living). I've been to quite a few appointments at this point which has for the most part been productive, but I find that a few larger concerns have been left unspoken of completely on my own part. Due to my current disposition I lack the skills to bring up these issues so they can be at least attempted to be addressed. I'm not sure where to start with it and even the thought of bringing these issues up causes immense feelings of embarrassment, which isn't something I can easily move past. So what I guess I'm asking is if there's any go to techniques to bringing concerns about my health mental or otherwise  to a professional.

88,"I honestly feel so down about everything lately.

I also have this really strong feeling that people don’t generally like me as a person because of this. In high school I had quite a few friends and could happily float into different groups, so now its confusing to have these feelings. 

At one of my jobs it was very cliquey and it was like only the ‘cool’ people got invited to go out and to non official work things and I never got invited unless it was officially a work Christmas party or something, but at the same time I didn’t feel like I was strongly disliked, just not really liked enough if that makes sense. And now with another one of my jobs, a whole group of girls went out this weekend and I wasn’t invited. I don’t think it was only me who wasn’t invited, but it still makes me feel like shit, i just feel like I can’t connect with people. I’ve never had a relationship. 

I just feel so alone in every way.

100,"Hey guys

I sorta wanna have this post to both vent stuff thats happened to me over the past 2 years, maybe ill be able to figure an answer out by mysellf, but also to see if you guys have got any stuff to say about this. I want to keep this as anonymous as possible, so please dont ask for any names.

So, im a 16 year old boy, and ive had a problem with girls. Yeah, sounds stereotypical ""ooh he cant get a girl so he thinks his life is shit"" but its not that... Every time i get close to someone something happens to keep us apart

The first girl i stated to get close to was in the year above me at school. I really liked her, she liked me (Well... lets get to that in a bit) We grew really close over the summer, and  we started doing stuff together and whatnot. She was my first kiss, and i had decent prospects. She was also a year older than me, which i do prefer to my year, cos the people in my year are immature AF (I either go for older or younger). I then found out that she was cheating on me with this other guy, and instead was using me for who i am (Im not saying who i am cos it will sorta distract the point away from this post, but ive got a fanbase n stuff, that kind of ""who i am""). I was devistated, and rlly just couldnt believe it. She then cut off all contact with me and left me in that state for a while. She then came back around half a year later. I dont like not-talking to people, so we started talking again, and the same thing happened. This time it really did impact me, and we stopped talking. She always used to rub it in my face that her and her boyfriend (Whichever one she was with at the time) were doing so well and that she ""hopes that i find one soon."" Oh yeah, and when i actually plucked up the balls to confront her in front of everyone, she turned it all on me, and text me later saying how everything was my fault, that i cheated on her and abused her (Shortly before she asked me to delete the whole conversation, which i did, buti still have screenshots of it). I dont like fighting back, so i just sorta accepted it and let it happen. This lost me a lot of respect in school, but i sorta just got on with it. 

The second girl i liked was a year younger than me. We were best friends since primary, but she moved down south. We kept in contact, and had been friends for 5 years. We started to grow close, and we talked every day. She was so cool. Around the end of may she suddenly stopped talking. She wasnt active, she wasnt texting or taking my calls. I thought it was fine, she mightve dropped her phone down the sink (as she had previously done.) Around about July i started to press on and figure out what had happened. I found nothing. i tried everything, looked for her online, called her and texted her. It was around about October that i got a call. It was from her parents. They told me she had been killed by someone. Police havnt found the killer yet, but she was on a night out with some friends and someon had come up and stabbed her. I still sometimes talk to ""her."" Ik, i just talk to myself, but it helps me not feel lonely.

The third girl i like, and am sorta currently talking to, is also a year younger than me. She is REALLY funny, kind, and genuinely seems to really like me. Whenever we see eachother we chat for hours about random stuff and spend so much time talking we forget what were supposed to be doing (This usually happens at our summer job, which we share). She's even said  to me that im the best person shes ever met (Its a long af text and i would bore you if i typed it out but thats effectively what she said, and on multiple occasions). The only problem is i dont really see her. She is ALWAYS busy doing something, and never has the time to message or call or meet up, and thats fine obviously, but i would like to see her or even just have a text conversation with her, and i really miss her and it feels awful. Its the start of her 2-year exam run too, and people manage it differently. Im coping really well with it, but others might not i guess. She just really understands me, and is why i like her. We have the same sense of humour and i love her energy levels (Which are sky high 24/7, like mine were before this shit happened.)

Am i doing something wrong? i genuinely have no idea what to do. I feel shit all the time, cos i really just need someone that i can properly share my life with, but something always gets in the way. I also dont have many friends at school, and the only time im really liked is when the people in my year are trying to use me, whether its for my music career, my sporting skills or my academic stuff too, and will only ever be nice to me if they want something done. I try and tell my parents about this, but every time i mention something to them or try and start to open up they say something along the lines of ""Youre joking right? Billions of people are worse off than you. Just get on with it."" I always try to seem like a really happy person thats a bit silly, cos thats the only me people seem to accept, but inside im just a mess. It rlly doesnt feel good, keeping this all bottled up, which is why i wanted to post on here. I wanted an outside opinion from someone who doesnt really know me, and someone who is able to give advice what to do.

Am i overreacting, and this is all normal for people my age, or is it actually something i need to address? Please dont take any action on this unless i say so, cos i want this to be anonymous and i dont want anything to suddenly happen.

101,"Typically when I remember my dreams from previous sleep, I notice that my dreams aren't very realistic, and at times can be strange (I understand that's a VERY vague description, but I'll try to give some examples of why they're strange). Characters from fictional universes will exist in my dreams(sometimes characters from separate universes are in my dreams simutaneously). Sometimes I'm dreaming from another person's perspective. I'm sure there's not much wrong with these things, but is it normal to ever have morbid, immoral dreams?

I know humans can think of many disgusting, horrible things to do in this world(like murder, robbery, or rape) and I participated in an act that I would never do in reality while asleep. I don't want to specify what kind of act this was, but it was absolutely immoral, inhumane, and absolutely illegal where I live. My problem is that I enjoyed it. It wasn't a nightmare. when I was dreaming. That's what is bothering me. I enjoyed what I did, and now that I'm awake I can't get it out of my mind.

This is the first time I can remember acting so horribly in a dream. Is it natural for some to have dreams like this? I don't think anything about me has radically changed about my character in reality, but it bothers me that I can't get this out of my head.",03Nov2019,1
102,Hey guys just wanna ask for some advice! So like I always get these episodes in my life where I’m extremely sad and just want to be alone. I lose interest in all my hobbies and distance myself from everyone I know and feel like I never want to be close to anyone again... then after a few weeks I’m back to normal and I’m happy again. This keeps happening to me every few months and I don’t know why. Don’t think I have any issues but this feeling just keeps coming back and it’s really affecting my relationships with people. Can someone please give me some advice on how I can stop feeling like this? Thanks guys!,03Nov2019,1
103,"Hey, y'all! I've been working on a project regarding self-care, and in my research, I've noticed most self-care stuff is marketed towards women and is based around traditionally feminine activities. Now obviously, guys can paint their nails and do face masks if they want (in fact I actively encourage it) but a lot don't feel comfortable with it, only bolstering the apprehensions men have around addressing their mental health and the idea that dealing with your emotions in a healthy way is somehow 'feminine'.

104,"I cheated on my Xgirlfriend 8 years ago. She had some issues like anxiety, personality disorder anorexia and depression and although I loved her a lot at the time I didn't feel like she was the one for me and so I tried to break up with her, but she scared me with all of her issues and she also self harmed so I was scared if I broke up with her she would hurt her self worse. As even during a little argument she tried her run into traffic ( I'm not sure if this was just to get a reaction iut of me or what ) but even so it's really crazy. So one of her friends at the time was really into me and I was a bastard and got with her. I didn't tell her till about a year later. Since I cheated on her I still feel like I dont like myself as much as I used to. And I feel bad, what can i do?

106,"I’m new to this sub just to share my story. And I want to know who can relate. 

I’m currently 18. When I was 16, I was diagnosed with depression, had a suicide plan, and spent 5 days in a hospital. Fast forward to when I’m applying for colleges about a year later. 

I applied to the US Air Force academy. I was instantly denied due to my history of depression despite being fully recovered. Fast forward more. I’m 18, I was accepted into a flight school with a guaranteed job and decent pay. I was excited to start. Until the FAA required my therapist’s notes and some other documents due to the history for a medical certification to fly. Submitted, then they demanded everything the hospital had and a psychiatric evaluation. The hospital is incredibly difficult and told me it could be weeks before they could get the documents submitted to the FAA. Despite having a deadline. I gave up and I have started to enlist in the Navy. It’s been weeks since I’ve submitted my medical prescreening and I’m yet to hear anything back. That’s probably not good. 

My history is really slowing or stopping my process to do anything I want to do. Despite being fully recovered for over 2 years and despite being put in a hospital by my parents by force. This record stays with me wherever I go and any criminal record could have been wiped and it could vanish from existence. And it’s really upsetting that I’d have less problems with a criminal record than I do with a mental illness history. Advice is also welcome.",03Nov2019,1

110,"I got pregnant when I was 18 years old. He was 32. The pregnancy happened very fast. After a month of dating. I was very unsure how I felt about him from the beginning. He was a virgin, and never had sex. He had only be on a handful of dates. He was pretty awkward and sometimes we would go out and he would be very dry, barely texted me, etc. I overlooked this and continued seeing him and ended up conceiving my son, who is now one years old. I broke up with him every other week (I was immature- obviously). I guess I felt trapped by being pregnant by him. We argued constantly. One being a time I found tinder in his phone which he claimed was there before we started dating, and I don’t remember that. Another time he let me get super drunk and wander around a hotel at 18, where his co-worker tried to take advantage of me. When we went apartment looking, he was very controlling and really didn’t let me have much say in picking the place. We broke up for good when I was about 3 months pregnant. Those were just some of the basic reasons we broke up. He assured me he was going to just focus on being a father. 3 weeks later, he’s in another official relationship. He wanted me to meet this woman he knew a month because he wanted her to be involved in our sons life. This is a woman who made pod cast online bashing people of religion, referring to her six year old as a “fuck trophy” and bastard. And also spent some time in prison for torturing someone. She was strictly no good. He never ask how our son was and gave me hell. He sued for overnights which forced me to stop breastfeeding and put me through a 14,000 custody battle. He even sued me to be in the delivery room and I made national news. The judge put his girlfriend in the parenting plan that she’s to never be around our son, and he ended up breaking up with her 3 weeks before he was due. The constant stress left me in and out of the hospital and he didn’t even care. This- right here, is what’s been extremely difficult to get over. We ended up getting back together, and 9 months later, we get married. It’s a constant fight. I stay with him because I am financially dependent on him. He pays my health insurance, car insurance, the bills and after a long discussion, he is *not* controlling with money. He works long hours so I tolerate him when he’s home. I am so unhappy it’s pathetic. His personality doesn’t match mine at all. He had an erectile dysfunction which made sex nearly impossible. He would  lose it inside me and it turns me off completely. He started some medication which helped but even then I had hate having sex with him. I don’t feel any emotional connection and I end up feeling disgusting and used. ( I have a history of sexual assault). His father is a serial killer who murdered his mother and next wife, and it obviously left him with some issues. My husband admitted a few months ago he had thoughts of murdering my mother and his ex. He said it would be really easy to “blow up their car” or hit them over the head with a hammer. He said these were just thoughts but I found them extremely disturbing. I told my mother and she tried to commit suicide she was so distraught I stayed with him. I started acting out. Purposely trying to start fights with him. I got drunk once and held a loaded gun to my head. I cheated on him with a friend I’ve known for 6 years. I told him the truth about it and we are seeking therapy. He made some rules for me. I can’t leave past 10, he can check my phone whenever. He won’t have sex with me but twice a week, and I can’t speak to any men. I would’ve never thought about cheating if I was in a stable, and healthy relationship and marriage.  am so depressed and mentally drained. I don’t know how much longer I can take this. Obviously I’m not sure why he thinks this relationship can or will work. He talked me into staying and at this point I am just doing it until I finish school and can leave. I have been having terrible panic and anxiety attacks. Feeling “unreal”, dizziness, feeling like I am losing control. I started shaking so bad the other night I couldn’t form a sentence, and had my husband call an ambulance. Everyday for the past week, I’ve woke up crying. I wake up with my heart racing and with a racing mind. I’m scared to leave my house or drive because I am afraid of having another panic attack. I’ve had them since I was 12, but recently they have got out of control. I’ve never been this bad off mentally. I feel so hopeless and my mental health has got so bad I can’t stand it anymore. I woke up this morning around 5 and my heart was racing so bad I grabbed my husbands arm and woke him up. I kept tossing and turning. He got up with me and offered to make some tea but acted almost as if he was irritated I woke him up. I told him I was just going to the couch because I didn’t want to bother him. I’ve been in here since, for 3 hours battling an off and on anxiety attack. I don’t want to wake him up but I wish I had someone to help me through this. I feel like such a bother and burden. I hold all this anger towards him for the way he treated me when I was carrying his child. I almost had our baby early due to high blood pressure causing contractions and premature labor onset. Even then, he didn’t care. All he cared about was his girlfriend. I keep having the obsessive thoughts of them being intimate together, having sex (especially since she was his second sexual partner) and it makes me fill with rage. It hurts me he wanted something like that introduced to his child, and didn’t even care about our son enough to protect him from someone like that. It kills me he couldn’t even try being friends with me or trying to make things work with me and instead moved on from our family so fast. I can’t make these thoughts stop and one year later I find myself getting mad all over again.",03Nov2019,1

113,"Hi everyone,

I'm new here and would like to get some advice on how to ask for medical help for the first time. What is the process usually when you leave your GPs office? I guess they do not diagnose or treat you but start referral process to a pshyciatrist for analysis and only then potential treatment? Can you shed me some light in your experiences so I know what to expect. (Blood test? Hormonal tests? Questionnaires?)

Little about me, I'm 28 female who has it all together for the most part- good career, healthy eating and weightlifting, nice relationship and parents etc. No true stresses in my life but since I was a teenager and all the way to my adulthood I suffered from a very manageable depression. No big deal, I'm perfectly handling it, however what's started to get in my way now and for years is my irritability. 

 I seem to snap at the most petty things, get days where I'm just full of rage and it's eating me from the inside and affects those close to me... so enough is enough and I  and my partner advised to seek medical help/diagnosis - maybe Im just the way I am for no reason just an arsehole of a person who is supposed to remain in solitary as people drive me mad...or maybe I have an underlying mental condition that needs to be controlled via mood stabilising medication?

I see myself fitting a bit in dysthymia and cyclothymia medical terms but again, maybe Im just seeing patterns when even healthy individuals would...

Anyway I still think I need help with extreme irritability that is only getting worse with age and before I lose all loved ones because of it.

Anyone with similar problems would also love to hear from you...so that I dont feel so alone in this weird head of mine.",03Nov2019,3

115,"I have been a bright student and have been able to understand stuff quite easily for most of my life. But of late, I find it hard to focus on any work I do and be productive. It's like my IQ has just dropped suddenly by 20 points. It's hard to explain so I'll give some examples below.

Scenario 1: If I'm in a meeting and someone is talking, I can clearly understand what the person is talking about at the moment but as soon as the topic changes, I find that I've forgotten or not understood what he/she said. I can understand he/she is saying ""2+2"" but I'm not able to process that into 4 and form my own opinions about it.

Scenario 2: While reading, I feel like I can read very fast and just go through the material understanding each sentence. But sometime later I realise that I've just skimmed through the material and haven't retained or processed it. Even I try and read as slow as I can, it doesn't seem to help.

Scenario 3: If I'm trying to write something or work, I can't process anything and am stuck without even starting. It's like my mind is blank and full at the same time.

Scenario 4: When driving, sometimes I realise that I've driven from one point to another crossing many vehicles but am unable to clearly remember what actions I took to get to that place. I don't make any mistakes while driving, just that I'm not able to remember after I've driven.

128,"Well i really don't know how to start cause i'm new here

The past couple of months have been tough. My mind is not clear. Just a lot of thoughts going on. Flashbacks, memories and whatever is going on currently is kinda affecting me. I would like to say its not serious but don't know really. Uni is also stressful. The thing is that i kinda know how each and everything is affecting me and how they are interrelated. I got to know about this because of my research project which will go on for a couple of years. Earlier i really didn't know much about mental health but i guess after doing a brief research about it made me realize that sharing whatever is in your mind is helpful. As a person, I never really shared about anything to anyone. That has improved over the past few years but still a lot of improvement has to be made.

What I feel is that by sharing whatever is in my mind would be helpful but it can affect the other person as well. I thought about sharing whatever i'm feeling as of now to my family. They are really supportive. But i don't know what it is, I feel that by sharing it would affect them. They are dealing with their own problems and are really busy. Even if i get the time to talk to them (which i rarely get), I would not share what I'm feeling because it can trigger memories or past experiences in their mind which can become an extra burden for them in a way. So i feel that as of now i should not really share what's bothering me or what i am feeling. Instead i would like to have a casual talk with them more frequently which i guess can take their mind off from some stressful things.

Second option which i thought about was sharing to my close friends. I approached to one of them and told that i just want to clear my mind and i just want to talk about it. I further told him that i am not expecting any solutions or anything, i just want to share which would be helpful. But uni has kept me really busy. I haven't been able to meet any of my friends for at least four months because of uni. And i don't want to talk about this over text or call. My other close friend is in a total different city. So talking to him is out of the option. In uni, there are two friends whom i feel comfortable to share to. Both of them are actually my group members in my research project. But one of them is dealing with some issues and i feel i should not share as of now because i want him to be out of that phase first. He shares somethings to me and i try to give an advice but at least listen. The second friend is from a different city. She also deals with the uni stress . So we have kinda talked about that which has helped. She is also dealing with her own stress.

During our research, we have come across people who had some mental issues or problems in the past. Some talked about how sharing about it to someone helped them. What we've realized is that we are not that mature to understand what the other person is feeling even if they share about it. This thinking kinda applies here. I don't think both of them would be able to understand what i'm feeling even though i share it and instead it can become a burden for them which i don't want to happen. So i resort to talking about uni stress to them.

So at present I don't know whom to talk to. I feel that i would be able to share about what i'm going through only to someone i'm comfortable to talk to. That is the reason I haven't really mentioned what I'm feeling here. But I felt this could be shared online. 

Plus I don't know if something like this is okay to share here or it is necessary to talk about how I feel. So if someone can tell me that it would be helpful.",03Nov2019,2
130,"My friend/roommate (we'll call her S) broke down a couple of days ago due to a lot of school stressers. She had some wine with one of her other friends and then sat down with me afterwards and told me she was in a really dark place mentally right now and that she wants to hurt herself. Our school counselor knows her situation, and I told S I think she should go speak with our counselor and perhaps think about medication. She said maybe.  I sat with her until she fell asleep. Shes up and doing her usually day-to-day duties for the past couple of days, but I'm doing my best to keep her company, watching shows with her, cooking food for her, etc.

I myself am taking medication for my depression and anxiety. In the past, I've helped other friends that were suicidal and have had depression, so I know how to be there for S.....but the last few times I helped depressed friends I fell into a dark place myself. I've had a very hard year, to the point where I wasn't really contemplating suicide, but where I'd lay in bed just wanting to sleep forever.

131,"So.. I don't even know how to even start (and I feel kind of dumb talking about it), but over the past 2 or 3 years I've been noticing some kind of decline in my mental health? I don't even know how to describe it.. Hearing from other people describing their mental illnesses, my symptomes do kind of match up with theirs, but I don't want to base my mental health around that.
I don't want to be that person who just diagnoses themselves, but something must be wrong..

I guess it's best to just explain how I feel.
I don't know when exactly it started, but I think I slowly started getting this strong feeling of tiredness around 2017. I started loosing interest in absolutely everything.
It started with drawing, my passion. At first I blamed it on a regular artblock, those come from time to time. But this one was different. It lasted several months, all the way into 2018. And it got only worse from then on. At this point I just felt like giving up drawing. If I tried to work, I'd just get very frustrated, that is if I even had the motivation to do something. 
Not only drawing, but everything I enjoyed doing just seemed worthless and too challenging. It got to a point where I even got bored of watching YouTube videos. Even though I'd always find new videos that I'd usually be interested in, I just hated watching them. But I still did because I had nothing else to do. 

I'm at my worst during breaks.
If I go to school I have responsibilities to take care of, even at home, so my day doesn't feel that empty. But if I don't have anywhere to be, I just stay in my room doing nothing. I'm just on my own, not talking to anyone.

(Ok I might go slightly off topic here, but I don't know how else to explain)
I've always been a very shy person and I've never made friends on my own. I'm never the one to approach another person, so that's why when we moved to the country side about 4 or 5 years ago, I couldn't have been happier to find a friend who is very outgoing and sociable. In my first year of living here, I didn't have any friends, because the one's I had back in the city cut all ties with me. I found out that my entire class hated me and secretly made fun of me. You know, before moving I actually was very talkative and always cracking jokes. I thought I was friendly with most of my classmates, which is why I was so shocked to find out that they just pretended to like me. It's not related to me moving tho, we just moved because we wanted to live in a house rather than in an apartment and we just happened to move too far away for me to continue to go to that school.
Ever since I started going to this new school, I've been.. different? I'm just nervous all the time, to the point where I can't even read without choking on my words. I sound like crying whenever I have to read out loud in class. It's not because of the environment, it just happens. I don't know where it came from either, it just started randomly. So you can imagine how awkward I am when talking to people I don't know that well.

Anyways, after some time I started to get closer with said friend and from time to time she befriends new people, making our group of friends bigger. Although we are a group of four ""close"" friends now, I still feel kind of left out.
I don't even know why, but I'm just having a hard time fully opening up to them. 
When my mental health really started to go downhill in 2018, I stopped seeing my friends as often. I just felt like I ruined the mood whenever I was around them. They invited me to all sorts of things but I just didn't feel like going. Afterwards they would talk about all the fun they had without me and I felt really hurt. I'm sure that they never intended to hurt me, after all it was my fault that I didn't go. But it made me feel even more left out. No, I made myself feel left out. I can't blame my friends for my decisions. This went on for a year, until I finally got a grip of myself and spent New Year's Eve with my friends. But the damage was noticeable. There was this constant distance that made me feel like I didn't belong. I've missed out on many fun times they've spent after all.
They had inside jokes without me and talked about things they did and topics they've talked about before, forgetting that I wasn't there to experience those things with them.
I think our friendship will never be the same after that year.

I don't even wanna know how mad they were at me when I declined to meet up with them so many times. I never really explained myself.
That summer I didn't leave the house even once. I didn't text them a single time. Nothing.
I was just by myself. I even had suicidal thoughts for the first time, but nothing concerning.
I've dropped some hints about my mental health during that time a year later, but I don't think they've caught on to it. I just don't have the balls to tell them.

There are very few moments where I build up the courage to tell them, but I guess my timing is just really bad. Whenever I want to tell them, I wait until the mood is right, but then they start talking about something that seems way worse than what I'm going through, so I just give up.
That's how I discovered that one of my friends is suicidal and another is seeing a therapist.
I never even considered how my friends feel. So hearing that they struggle too, just discouraged me from talking about myself.
I don't know if they're actually diagnosed with something, but even if they aren't, it'd feel weird to start talking about my problems when they're talking about theirs.

To give a recent example:
About a week ago we met up to get drunk and somehow the topic of suicide came up. So the friend who we know is suicidal started talking about her feelings, but just very briefly, because the other two already know what's going on. I never really dared to ask and she doesn't really talk to me outside of our group of four. So the friend who went to therapy started crying and gave this whole speech, encouraging her and telling her that we're there for her. She talked about many things I relate to and I eventually started crying too. But my friends don't know how I feel. This would have been the perfect moment to talk about myself, but this wasn't about me. It was about my friend. I had no right to just draw the attention towards me.

Like, I don't even know if I'm just overreacting or if I actually have a mental illness. I'm just scared of telling them because it might be very triggering.
And don't even get me started about my parents. They would never even consider that anything's wrong with me. And they wouldn't understand if I told them either, they'd just say I'm overreacting.
My mom always scolds me about my room being a mess. She thinks I'm too lazy to clean up, but I just can't. Of course I don't want to live in a dirty room, but sometimes I just can't clean up. I don't let anyone come over anyways. 

I think my mental health has improved over the past few months, but now I'm starting to fall into this hole of emptiness again. I don't know what to do anymore. It's not that I'm suicidal, but sometimes I do wonder why I'm still here. I don't have any goals in life. I'm too scared to even look for a job in fear of messing up. I'm too scared to meet new people. I can't even keep my friendships alive. I don't really make an impact. I'm sure everyone would forget about me in a week or two. I've never really been impacted by deaths of my family members and I know that's very messed up. But I think people are gonna feel the same way about me.
I always joke about just ending it after I'm done with school, but I'm not sure if it's just a joke.
I am considering getting help after I turn 18, that way my parents won't have to find out. But I'm too scared.

Anyways, thank you for reading through this mess (even tho I don't get why anyone would do this to themselves).. I just had to write down my feelings because I'm really not in a good state of mind today. Crying would have helped, but I can't for some reason. I would be thankful for any advice on what I should do about this, but you don't really have to respond to this. I guess I'll be fine.

132,"Hello, everyone, I hope you are doing well today.

I wanted to seek out a forum where I could share my experiences with mental health treatment and see how it compared to others as I feel like my experience was very unique and unusual. For a brief background I visited a psychiatrist and several therapists over the course of two years (2017-2019) and had very negative experiences overall.  My name is Alice, I am 22 year old transwoman who is diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.

I want to preface this by saying despite me having very poor experiences with mental health treatment I do not have an anti-medication stance or mistrust medical professionals. I have many friends who have went through mental health treatment and had positive results. My personal experiences just did not seem to be as positive. 

I had struggled with my mental health consistently since about middle school, maybe around age 12 or 13. I had consistent depression, suicidal ideation and panic attacks. I was unable to see a professional until I was an adult due to my parents having negative perceptions of mental health treatment and not allowing me to seek help. In December of 2017, I finally visited a professional and was diagnosed by my psychiatrist and put on a small dose of Prozac. My experience at first was positive. A few months later I went back and reported that I was improving but was still not where I would like to be. My doctor raised my dosage and my mental health almost immediately declined. I become very lethargic, emotionless, had foggy thinking and was even speaking and moving slower, had delayed reaction time. I began having suicidal thoughts and reported it to my doctor. It was around this time as well, that I had a mood episode that my doctor described as being similar to mania. While she stuck with the diagnosis of MDD and GAD over my treatment period, she was always unsure of my mood symptoms. Her best guess was a very-unsure assumption that I may have traits of borderline personality disorder since my sister (who she also treated) has a more severe case of that. The manic episode was very brief but I remember leaving my parents house really late at night, driving to a mall and going on a huge spending spree while being very energetic and overly-confident (which is rare for an introverted and shy person like myself). I had never had an episode like that before Prozac, which makes me question if it was the medication, or actually a mood episode.

The conclusion that I had borderline personality disorder traits personally never added up for me. It felt like my doctor was taking very specific isolated incidents and forming a picture that did not represent me. I'm not a medical professional, and I could be wrong, but I just never felt I met that diagnosis.

At this point I was taken off Prozac and put on Abilify as she thought it would treat the mood symptoms and my depression. Within a few days my anxiety had become significantly worse to the point that I was having panic attacks at work and had to take several sick days due to feeling ill. I was given my first anxiety medication, a small dose of hydroxyzine which I was taking twice a day. I was taken off Abilify and put on Vraylar since it was suppose to be less activating yet still treat depression and mood symptoms. It was at this point that things started to snowball downhill. Within a few months of taking Vraylar I had developed something similar to chronic fatigue syndrome. I was sleeping my days away, barely able to function at work, was very hazy and forgetful and could not concentrate. By mid 2019, I had gained 80 pounds, had sexual dysfunction, tremors in my hands, became severally depressed and had reoccurring suicidal thoughts. I had also begun self-harming, which I did not previously have a history of. The self-harming and suicidal thoughts my doctor said were confirmations that I had borderline personality disorder. My doctor tried lowering the dosage of Vraylar and adding back in Prozac (despite my negative experience before, assuring me it would work this time). When neither worked she moved me to Effexor at a high dosage, which I did not have negative side effects from, but it also did not seem to do anything for my depression. I was two years into treatment and my depression had not improved, in fact, it had gotten worse. In September, I told my psychiatrist that I would like to discontinue treatment. She was respectful and helped me get off of my medication. I had a few weeks of serious discontinuation symptoms including migraines, brain zaps, severe anxiety, agitation and depression. Since that period of time, however, I have been doing very well and feel happier and more stable than I have in two years. 

I would also like to share my experience with anxiety medications as they are apparently pretty unique too. I was tried on hydroxyzine, gabapentin and then finally Klonopin when nothing worked. Strangely enough, even on a higher dosage of Klonopin I could be having a severe panic attack and I would not respond at all to the medication, I would feel no change after the period of time it was suppose to be active. I've talked to other friends with mental health problems, and none of them have reported it not doing anything at all - my doctor even found this very unusual. I was okay with this outcome in a way though, because I had a fear of becoming hooked on benzodiazepines.

It really feels that for me my mental health only got significantly worse while on medication and I found that therapy was not personally useful for me, even after two years and trying different therapists with very different approaches. I even tried a therapist who specialized in trans patients.

Has anyone else had a similar experience where treatment seemed not only ineffective but actually worsened their symptoms?",03Nov2019,2
133,"I've been in a long distance relationship for about a year with the most amazing girl. I love her a lot and have never bee n this close to anyone else, so I guess that's why I've stayed with her despite my anxiety. I can't even imagine a life without her, so things would have to get pretty extreme for me to actually leave her.

Now to the main point: She has been through a lot and suffers now from some kind of depression and a eating disorder. She sometimes have suicidal thoughts and have tried to killed herself more than once. The last time she attempted was about 5 months ago, but she didn't confess to me until last month. This has left me freaking out.

I didn't know what I was getting myself into when I befriended and eventually started dating her. I didn't know how bad things were for her, and I was (and am) young and extremely in love. But now, around 1 year into the relationship, I'm in this constant worried state and I have a constant urge to ""run away"" because I'm not dealing with this very well. Every time she says something ""suicidal"" I start freaking out. For example, today: Unfortunately, a close friend of her attempted suicide today and may not survive. I asked my girlfriend if she thought about killing herself. Her answer: ""No. But I can't see what the problem would be if I did kill myself"". 

This comment was enough to make me go crazy. I feel freaked out and so anxious over the fact that I love someone this much and am building a life around a person who might just end up killing herself and leave me alone and traumatized for life. Before I knew that she attempted 5 months ago, I was a little calmer since I thought ""it's been over a year since her last attempt"". But now that I know that she attempted recently while in a relationship with me and without telling me... It has affected me. I'm anxious and I have trust issues. 

I want to be with her so badly, but this is what makes me question quite often if I should leave. I'm just so terrified that she'll kill herself someday. I feel trapped and don't know what to do. Every time I try to look for support or advice online I just find ""how to support someone who's suicidal"". But I can't find anyone else who deals with the same fears and worries as I do. I don't want to break up with someone who I consider to be my soulmate, but I don't want to build a life with someone who might just kill herself anytime. I don't know what to do... 

Before anyone says anything: She sees a psychologist and is in therapy, she has been for years. She doesn't go very frequently though, just every few weeks I think. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I freak out whenever my girlfriend of 1 year expresses suicidal thoughts, and I don't know how to handle it or if I should just break up.",03Nov2019,2
134,"Recently, I noticed that I feel like doing things less and less. I used to be pretty outgoing with my friends, even doing dares and talking to strangers. Ever since I joined high school though, I've been feeling pretty down. I barely talk to anyone and the most I do get out is a couple sentences to a couple people. I'm in the basketball team, but I never want to go to basketball anymore. I used to love playing basketball but now it feels like I never have time too or want too go to practices. I've been procrastinating on homework, doing it right before class, and plying video games all day and night. I love video games, but I get angry a lot easier at them now. Before I never used to get really mad, but I accidently started swearing one of my teammates out when he cost us a raid(destiny 2) I don't know if it's stress of hs, my depression, or something else.

135,"I genuinely can't remember the last time I was happy. I'm almost to a point where I think I'll never feel truly happy.

I sometimes try to get happy by living vicariously through other ppl online or friends and family. Sure that may work but once I leave the feeling also leaves.

I used to think if I made a checklist of things to accomplish that that would definitely make me happy.
-Graduate College
-Have a nice job
-Be an awesome friend to other and they would be the same to you
-Find someone to share your life with

I've completed most if the list, don't know if I'll add more to it yet, but still no closer to being happy.

138,"Hello everyone, i have been suffering from depression for almost three years now and in these three years i did make three attempts of getting help. 
Sadly my experience with psychotherapy was not the best but since its autumn again i am willing to give it another try. The problem is that my parents resent the idea of psychotherapy. The first few times my mom was actually kinda supportive but later on she adopted the mindset that psychotherapy is just a waste of money and exists only in order to pit young adults against their parents.
She also believes that therapists purposefully lie to the people they are threating in order to make them believe that they are truly sick.

Recently my depression started kicking in again and the topic of psychotherapy was brought up by me again. My mother brushed it all off by telling me that i am lazy because i dont want to work on myself and instead want a person who will just tell me what to do. She also continues to believe that yoga will cure me.
So i am ready to try and adress this again with her and i need Your help to convince her that psychotherapy actually helps.

139,"Hello everyone, I just want to preface this post out by saying in no way and I trying to  perpetuate negative stereotypes associated with either schizophrenia or psychosis.  I am genuinely writing this out of concern for my own mental health and hopefully someone else can relate to this post. I will start out by saying two years ago to this very date I had a very bad experience with weed. I had never really smoked  weed seriously before. Two years ago all my “friends” got together to smoke. Me, trying to appear like I knew what I was doing  took many hits from a bowl that was being passed around. I was feeling fine at first. In fact, I didn’t feel high at all. Until around 30 mins later it hit me out of nowhere. My heart began to beat extremely fast (200 bpm) and I began to freak out thinking I had smoked laced weed and was going to die. (A guy I had previously went to high school with smoked laced weed and was admitted to a mental hospital, I was certain I was going to end up like him). Needless to say, I went to the emergency room because I was determined I was dying. The doctors had to give me a drug to slow my heart rate down. I was panicking in the ER shaking, and asking if I was dying. The doctors assured me that I wasn’t dying. I was released from the ER a couple hours later and returned to campus. Everything was relatively fine until a month after the incident. Around  Amin this after my ER visit I suffered a major panic attack. This is where my life began to spiral. Ever since that night (yes, two years later) I have been convinced I am becoming schizophrenic or psychotic. I research my symptoms every day. When I wake up in the morning my first thought is that I am schizophrenic. I am constantly reading forum posts about schizophrenia and psychosis. I don’t feel like doing anything anymore. I used to have dreams and wished and now I just don’t care. I am worried I will never feel better. A week ago I visited a psychiatrist and he told me thy I was suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder and major depressive disorder. This only provided me temporary believe. Now if more than ever I am consumed that I am schizophrenic and psychotic. I am not sure what to do anymore. What if I never recover?",03Nov2019,2

My girlfriend has had depression for pretty much all of her life. She tried to kill herself like 5 years ago but her parents took her to the hospital and saved her. Her parents took her to a psychiatrist and psychologist, she took antidepressants but she gave up on them. She has told me that she has made a lot of progress by herself and she doesn´t want any help, because she is scared that if she takes antidepressants and they do not work, she will feel like she was absolutely no way to get better. She would feel hopeless. So she doesn´t want to find out if the medication will work for her or not. When she tells me how she feels I have no idea of what to tell her. Our relationship is toxic and we both know that but we are extremely dependent on each other, I feel sad and overwhelmed almost every day. I have distanced myself from my family, my friends, I feel worried all the time and I can´t take it anymore. I just need her to ask for help. She has the money to afford medicine and professionals, her parents love her and care about her mental health but they don´t know that she is still feeling like this. They would help her if they knew. There is nothing stopping her from asking for help but herself.

She is extremely intelligent and knows how to defend any argument she has. She is too smart for her own good in that way because is extremely hard to change her mind.

She is 21 by the way. She is studying the same mayor I am, but she is 1 year ahead. She lives with her parents.

146,"I've struggled with anxiety throughout this year,  triggered by personal issues. I've been on medication ( no longer taking as I didn't like the effects) and have been going to counselling for a few months. I work full time, contracted to 50 hours per week plus commuting time each day, and as I'm a person who needs 7-8 hours sleep per night I essentially have no time to take care of myself in the week. Weekends are taken up with being an adult- shopping, cleaning, life admin, visiting terminally ill MiL and whatever else comes our way.

This weekend I think I have hit breaking point.

I feel like I need time to work on making myself well, doing my 'homework ' from counselling, dealing with the issues that are stopping me from being healthy and happy. I need to get off the treadmill.

I don't want to take it week by week, I want to say I am taking off the rest of the year. I will go back to work in the New Year, and make a real commitment to myself and to the company to work on my mental health while I'm off so I can return healthy and focused.

I'm concerned my workplace will see this as weak and I will get 'managed out' - I've seen it happen to others. I love my job and want to continue working for the company.

I know a lot of my symptoms are related to depression, but from what I’ve read online about depression it seems like a halfie. It started 2 Wednesday’s ago, when I’ve started losing consciousness about things around me, like I wasn’t as focused or aware as much as I was before. I’m only 14 and it just seemed different, scary, and something an older person would be more likely going through. I couldn’t focus as well as I used to, and I felt more tired. And I don’t know if this could be related, but the same time this started happening I got my period. It was really bad during my period, the mental stuff. Sometimes I would just catch myself staring at the wall and sleeping more often. I was in fact more tired, but I only slept to make my day go faster. My mom made me go to the doctor for a referral for a therapist. But she wanted me to go for something completely different other than what I was going through. She didn’t even know. My doctor prescribed me for antidepressants and it actually worked! It was helping my issues, but I still haven’t been able to go to my therapist yet.

I've been struggling with accepting my body image ever since I started puberty (I'm a chubby-ish girl, big thighs... you can imagine) and it's something that never went away although I never put enough effort to actually change my image because everything I try just frustrates me after a while. This got way worse after I moved to the US as an international student two years ago. In my first 6 months or so, shit got bad due to cultural shock (anxiety, crying, longing home, etc). Got out of that, but after the summer everything got mixed up and felt worse than ever: my body image mixed with my stress and the adaptation to a new place plus a lot of academic stress (uni apps) I couldn't deal with... ended up in me being on my bed for little more than 4 weeks, avoiding deadlines and anything academic related in general. I did manage to finish the year and not fail with a LOT of help from my teachers (it was a boarding school). I still don't really know what happened during those months.

150,"Hey all, I'm freaking out a bit because of my room mate. I'll give you a bit of context. We were college room mates back in the day and we were great friends, but now things have changed. He has some serious mental problems like borderline personality disorder and depression and suicidal. I kinda new some of that stuff but other things he kept hidden from me. I recently bought a house and needed room mates to help pay my mortgage. So I thought since we were already room mates, this would be easy. Turns out i was mistaken. He has lived in the house for a year and a bit but he has already been to the hospital twice because of suicidal thought. Has called me a piece of shit because he thinks I'm taking money for him and his family. He doesn't work and he is being subsidize by his parents or ODSP. My other room mate told me that he was never on ODSP, so I dont know where he is getting the money from. My thinking is as long as he pays me every month for rent and utilities, I don't really care. It's always a battle with him to get rent and utility and we live in one of the most expensive towns to rent in Ontario (Aurora) and every time I come home I think he will just snap at me for no reason because he is not dependable and I'm the only one that has a job that I need to go to and he just pays video games all day (btw he is nearly 30). He takes no responsability on anything that he does. He thinks I'm just a piece of shit that is taking advantage of hin and I'm starting to get really pissed off. 

He's just regurgitating the same shit over and over again and I'm over it. I've already threatened to kick him out because he steals only my food and not my other room mates, idk why he does that because that just pisses me off even more, tells me that it's because I dont take him grocery shopping enough and I'm the only one with the car (hes still nearly 30 and I'm not his mother). Doesnt want to get an uber account because he doesnt like meeting new people because he gets too anxious. And he went suicidal, called 911, police, paramedic, social workers, everything. Came back on some mood stabilizers and apologized and I thought that was the last of it. I told him if he has another outburst like that then I will ask him to leave. So we have a bit of a truce going at the moment but I think its if he has another burst of anger towards me then I'll kick him out, but if I do then I fear he will go suicidal and try to kill himself because no one wants to deal with him. He comes from a good family but he left everything to come like with me because he thinks he will get better. But hes not and hes not doing anything about it.

Anyone have any advice to give me? I'm just waiting for his next outburst. He knows the repercussions if he does, but idk if he will try to kill himself. We had an agreement where if it doesn't work out then we will move on, but it's to my understanding that he doesnt plan on upholding that agreement. I'm afraid if I do show him the door then he will try to kill himself. He's already been to the hospital twice because of our disputes.",03Nov2019,6

156,"I, (15)F, don't exactly know whether this is the right place to talk about my little issue since most of the people posting on here have way bigger problems than I do but I was wondering if someone experiences the same thing. 
When I am in a room with lots of people a specific feeling hits me. My heart starts racing, my breath gets really fast and the best word to describe the following is dizziness. I don't feel like I have to vomit but because my eyes suddenly go crazy and try to see every person at once there is no clear image of my surrounding in my head and the noise gets really intense at that point. It gets better when I leave the room/place. If not, this uncomfortable feeling stays until i do and I can barely talk or do something on my own because I am too scared plus I don't like touching/being touched by other people even if it isn't on purpose so I simply freeze where I am standing. It is just too much for me but it seems perfectly fine for the others. So my question is: is this a part of my personality or more than that? Do other people experience this?

157,"I was always told that “it gets better”. They were right. I’ve moved out (mostly) of the house that stressed me out, I’ve made friends, I’ve lost a small bit of weight, I got a job, I even have someone I’m dating.
It got better, but I didn’t. For a while I thought I was getting better, may have even said I was happy once. I feel just as, if not more, empty as I was when I was diagnosed.
I’m still young in the grande scheme of things, but I have not gotten better. In fact my body is giving up along with my mind - aches and pains, a protruding disc in my lower spine, twitching in my eye when stressed and all my joints are stiff.
I feel like giving up.

Does anybody here struggle with atypical compulsions but is not formally diagnosed with OCD?

For background, I have been formally diagnosed with the following: general anxiety disorder, bipolar 2, and chronic PTSD. Any information or just experiences that you might relate to with this would be greatly appreciated, thank you!

She is rich, and attractive. After a a month dating she suprise me with The news that she had paid a wedding planner. We married 4 month after, she paid The wedding. I am 28 years old Engineer, younger than her, and not rich.

Refer to me as her trophy when she talked to her Friends.

Has multiple fake accounts to flirt with guys, it didn't matter how old, young, fat, etc... It didn't matter, it only came down to being admire by men. She probably cheated, I am 99% sure.

She would manipulate everything so that we would stumble with her ex when we hang out at some place. In one opportunity her ex attacked me from behind. Later I found out that when we started our relstionship she was in a relstionship with this guy. So I accidentally was her young lover. The guy is older than me.

When we had a discussion she would attacked me physically. Sometimes she would just stare me with this blank look, like a shark. Once I stood silently and wait to see if she would react or something. 4 minutes of that cold stare until I decided to talk.

She always believed I was cheating on her, she would Say "" You probably have other women, but I also have alot of men crazy for me.""

She told me her biggest fear was being abandoned after her father left her when she was a kid. She was raised by an physical and emotional abussive mother with tendency to play cards and Games betting.

I took her to 3 doctors. The first doctor told us that My ex was Bpd. The second doctor told us that she was Histrionic. The third doctor told us she was bipolar... I swear I am not lying.

After she started to threating me to kill me, etc... I file for a divorce. We were together for just a year.

I never cheated,. Never hitted her, etc... She hated every female figure in My life, including my mother and sisters.

Once I saved a female dog from the street. She waited for me to leave so that she could return that poor animal to The streets. I saved the dog later on and found her a place to stay with a friend of My family.

One month after the breack up, she started a relationship with another man. She didn't wait to be a divorced woman.

During her new relationship she was constantly trying to hook up with me. She lasted a few months with this guy. After she broke with her guy she went crazy, constantly harrassing me. She, until this day, threatens  to kill me or Any woman that I decide to date.

After more than a year I have been emotionally unable to date. If like something is dead inside of me. I fear women now a days.

She is constantly looking for me, Even to this day.

This question is for those that have been in a relatonship with a DIAGNOSED partner. I want to see if anyone relate to My story. Is this a person suffering from Bpd, Bipolar or histrionism? I know it is impossible to diagnose someone on The internet. But still, I want to see if anyone have lived something like this.

166,"Hi.

I'm posting here because something lately has been nagging at my conscience about myself that I really want to try and start addressing. Basically for my entire life I have been somewhat of a detached asshole. I have never been an asshole in the way that I go out of my way to hurt people, animals or act in a malicious manner. However, I think there are deep flaws in my personality that I would like to address that could potentially harm those around me just as much. I will try to cover them here:

* Generally aloof. For example, I am painfully unaware of people's birthdays, forget people's names I just met, and I generally don't consider other people's lives outside of my own on a regular basis. I have to force myself to remember things like this and even when I do, it slips out at a moment's notice.
* I have a great deal of trouble putting myself in other people's shoes. I often only think about how things will affect me, if even that. I can't imagine the nuances of other people's lives, and it comes out in conversation when I fail to remember things they've told me previously and apply it to new information. It's strange to describe, but basically every time I speak to someone it's like a new slate.
* In online video games, I'm a complete asshole. I'll tell people what to do, never change my mind on strategies, and generally flame people if they don't play how I see is the right way. I spend a lot of time playing games, and I think it has become very representative of my personality traits.
* Vain sexual pursuits: I often look at attractiveness on a surface level. I look at how 'sexy' someone is and not often at their personality. I think this something that developed over time, through use of pornography. I never used to be this way and valued many other things in people, but I have become very focused on that *one* thing over time.
* Social anxiety/reservedness: For many years I have been reserved. I have a tight knit group of friends and I never venture outside that. I can easily make small talk with people I like, but I get very awkward and stand-offish with people I don't. I can tell this comes off badly.
* Addictions: There are two addictions that are completely controlling my life. Night and day, it's something I need to feel normal. I can't detach myself from it, even though I know its bad. I have this fatalistic view I am kind of reserving myself to, where I rationalize that this is the way I will be for the rest of my life. I desperately want to escape the cycle, but I can't.

These are the major things I can think of now. This has kind of become a rant, and I apologize. I just want to start to feel better. Any suggestions on reading material/habit building/thought exercises would be helpful.",03Nov2019,1

The thing is, upon processing that answer a few seconds after the person said it, my vision was distorted for a good minute, I got a ""tunnel vision"", everything around me looked as if I'm going past it at 1000 mph. I think I literally only saw white (human equivalent of blue screen?) for a solid 5-10 seconds.

To clarify, the answer I got was something I never deemed possible, was beyond my worst fears. Basically, I wasn't even aware that such a bad option is even possible, it was way beyond even my worst case scenario. Those 5 minutes after getting that answer actually changed my life completely, just to explain how big my shock was.

186,"Ok, I know this is going to sound weird, but something happened to me a couple of months ago and I would really like to talk about it.

I am in my 30s and always had a nice life. Of course I struggled with up and downs, but nothing out of the ordinary for me. I work out and run regularly, around 5 times a week. I work at a big firm (i.e. office work) long but not too long hours (let's say 8-10h per day).

So this is what I experienced a couple of months ago:

I was extremely stressed out. Work was very demanding and I was managing a huge amount of cases/tasks for a client that I absolutely adore. The client is great and demanding, and I was coordinating a lot of work for it, which means that I needed to rely on several other teams of my firm and review everything before sending to the client. I was also working inside another client a couple of days a week, which means that I had 3 office days to do all the work of the week.

I  always managed to control my work routine and I work fast, so I usually did not work long hours (11-12h) per day, but in this specific time of my career I was on the verge of a burnout. I woke up tired everyday and complained to my SO regularly. It was bad and I did not see when my daily routine would go back to how it was before.

I was also expecting a trip that I was longing for (vacations, which means I would be able to not think about work for 10 days!), and the fact that I was going to ask my SO to marry me might have affected my mind as well (although I was not nervous at all about this).

Then something clicked. Out of nowhere.

Today I feel like my stress level was getting higher and higher and closer to my stress feeling threshold until it finally surpassed it.

That's when I stopped feeling stressed. I mean, I really ceased feeling any symptom of stress (or so I though). I woke up with a huge amount of energy, went to work, came back late, went for a run and worked out everyday. And at night I still had a lot of energy (and needed less sleep time at night to feel fresh in the morning)!

At work my productivity skyrocketed. When I ran I could feel my heart jumping on my mouth, but the feeling I had during the entire day was simply awesome. I was lifting more weight than ever before.

I also partied more than usual (it was a time full of happy hours) and stopped feeling hangover. Yes, for some time I did not feel any headache, stomach pain or anything after drinking! Great, huh?

Have you guys seen the movie Limitless with Bradley Cooper? If you have, the sensation I had was that my body was producing its own NZT.

Everything was really really good. I was feeling truly happy to be living life at its fullest. I remember thinking that if I dropped dead at that time I would die happy, but I never wanted to die though.

So after two weeks I started finding it weird that I could feel my heart beating all the time. It was not beating faster, I just felt it beating HARDER in my chest. So coming back from work I stopped at a drugstore and asked to have my blood pressure checked.

It was high (16-10)! Higher than ever, actually. My bp was supposed to be normal or a bit low (12-8 or 11-7), so finding out about this had a huge impact. I became afraid. The following day I kept checking my bp during the day at work, and it was still high (15-10 or 15-9), so I decided to go to a hospital at night.

At the hospital I talked to a cardiologist and had some tests done to check out my heart. It was fine, nothing weird apart from my bp. The next day I started feeling a tingling sensation in my arms and legs (pretty much all day long, with a few interruptions, and every time was a different limb, there was no apparent logic why I was feeling this).

I was genuinely afraid to die of a heart problem. That happened recently to a person I know and that was a huge shock for me. I bought a bp monitor and became obsessed with using it all the time. Usually my bd was 14-9 or 13-8 by now.

Then I went on vacation. Great trip to beautiful places, work was completely off my mind. It was great and I finally asked my SO to marry me, everything was perfect. I stopped feeling my heart beating all the time. Occasional tingling in my arms and legs was still there (and is still up to this day, although less frequently).

When I returned, I went to a cardiologist again (and later to a vascular surgeon), had a bunch of tests done, which were all normal (heart and thyroid), and the doctors said I needed only to keep checking my bp to see if it would rise again. Now it is kind of stable at 13-8, which I now find ok. No medication needed for now. Both doctors (and another one that I called) said that what I had was very likely related to overwhelming stress.

Work is a better now, the client has been demanding a bit less and I do not go anymore to the other client where I spent 2 days per week, so now I have time to do my work without that much stress.

Well, this is my recent story. I just wanted to vent it and to check if something similar has occurred to anyone.

Looking back I believe that generalised stress caused this to me, and weirdly I can say that these 2 ""limitless"" weeks were one of the best times of my life (the following week was bad though, as I was convinced I had a heart problem).

Until today I find myself with a lot of extra energy, and I have been working out and running to release it. Also, my happiness level is still high, so I got that going for me.

So I want to let some things out that are in my mind at the moment.
The last month I had really bad sleeping problems ad tomorrow I will go and see a doctor bc of this. I suffered some mental health issues for years but never visited a doctor (most likely some type of depression bc I used to cut myself and nearly killed myself a few types). 
Now I'm thinking about to ask my doctor if I should see a psychiatrist. What do you think? 

For more backstory: I recently started university and I'm still living with my parents. When they found out about my cutting behaviour (I think they found out 1 or 2 years after I started cutting) they screamed at me and asked me how I could do such a thing to them. After this they mostly ignored it. 
They never tried to understand me and after a few month they stopped taking my issues serious completely. 
I never had the courage to go to a psychiatrist with my parents or alone. 

I hope that this isn't too bad explained (if some parts are hard to understand or if more backstory is needed just ask).

I just wanted to let all out and maybe talk a little bit about it.

188,"My parents aren’t terrible people, they just pushed me way past my limits for many years. Never really got to have fun and have a childhood. They also were always fighting so that definitely affected me too. Nothing was ever good enough.

I’m now an adult that can’t relax, and I feel guilty when not working. I don’t have the ability to slow down and take a much needed break. Constant anxiety.

Has anyone “recovered” from something like this? I’d just like to find balance and be a normal human being.",03Nov2019,1
189,"Losing interest

Hello (M 16), I have this problem where I am really committed and enthusiastic for something I’m doing like a project, idea, diet, daily workouts etc. but then burn and lose interest in the activity and this has constantly plagued my life. 
I’m wondering if anyone else has this problem and if anyone has any tips to combat it please leave a comment.
Thanks in advance.",03Nov2019,1
190,"I graduated with my M.Ed. in Counseling in August of this year. I went straight from interning to being employed. I knew it wasn’t somewhere I would want to work long term, but I thought it would at least be bearable. It’s not. The job I have literally sucks the life out of me. I come home exhausted, drained, and discouraged almost every day. At my company, we are treated like work horses and nothing more. You are expected to have no work life separation and they could give two shits about self-care. The higher ups stay awake working on notes into the wee hours of the morning, you should too. The supervisors like to micromanage, belittle, and humiliate us. It’s not just me either. Everyone who works in my division is miserable. It is beating me down to a point where I am starting to question why I chose to do this. Did I really spend 8 years in school for this? To make peanuts and be treated like shit for a living? I know first jobs are supposed to be rough, but this is soul crushing. I’m trying to find another job, but there is literally nothing available in my area. What is available requires and LPC certification, which I have not yet obtained and am unable to because I don’t make enough money right now to actually pay the application and supervision fees. I feel trapped, desperate, and deeply disappointed. This is not what I thought my life would be and it is eating me up.",03Nov2019,1
191,"i need encouraging words. i don’t know. i guess i go in phases of this, but shit is just super uncool lately. basically everything going on right now is painful for me. i’m not emotional but i’ve cried at the drop of a hat lately. my best friend just told me she doesn’t want to be friends anymore (maybe rightfully so, i’ve reflected and i’m a bit selfish but i don’t think it’s intentional or to hurt anyone.). i hate the path i’m on in school and have such dread about the future and i’m worried i’m going to hate my life. my attitude has been shit. it’s near impossible to get out of bed. my bills keep climbing. etc etc. don’t want to call whatever is going on “depression” as i don’t think i have a chemical imbalance but i am just EXHAUSTED with life and want to give up. 

apparently while drunk last night i revealed to my boyfriend that i genuinely want to kill myself. im a dramatic person but i’ve never outloud expressed this in such a serious way. it scares me. 

i so badly need to get out of this rut. this is torture.",03Nov2019,1
192,"Hey there, I'm not super well versed in mental health disabilities so I'd really like to hear advice from some people. A Friend of mine recently got a new job, they are 20, living in America, and after about of week of working, they are becoming very discouraged. They tell me there's a lot of things that they aren't quite understanding and they have to ask a supervisor for help constantly even during busy hours.

They feel really guilty for not being able to do the job without help at this point and is now expressing concern that they have a learning disability. They think this because a google search said that people with LD have trouble with math, attention, memory, and following directions.

Personally, I don't think they have an LD because they graduated high school without any teacher expressing concern, and is now in college. I'm very concerned because I don't want them to resign themselves to being disabled and trap themselves into thinking they can't do things that are within their possibilities. They really like this job and I don't want them to quit because of this self-diagnosis. 

Any advice on how I can help my friend?",03Nov2019,4
193,"First off let me just say I'm not looking for a reddit diagnosis. I know I posted on this subreddit earlier, I'm just really not doing too well right now. I'm curious if what I am experiencing are signs of depression just so I could look more into getting help. 

For one, I have been having panic attacks. They started happening more often, and I would end up almost passing out from hyperventilation. The next day I'd be very embarrassed that it happened and would dread going to school. 

I also haven't had a big interest in talking to friends. I prefer to be away from them. They all seem to annoy me more, but they aren't doing anything different than normal. I just feel a slight anger. Really though, just the thought of talking to people sounds exhausting. However, the lack of social interaction causes me to feel worse. I still don't have a desire to talk so either way it's a losing situation.

My sleep has been rough. I wake up several times in the middle of the night. I started sleeping earlier just because I am always so tired. It doesn't help. Even on the few occasions I don't wake up in the night, in the morning I still feel exhausted. I never feel well-rested.

The things I enjoy just aren't as fun anymore. I no longer look forward to doing them. There isn't a spark. 

My ability to concentrate and remember things has worsened. The in turn has affected my school work. I don't really care about it anymore. I don't have the motivation. It's harder for me to get work done. I've fallen behind on my homework and even didn't turn work in last Friday. For me, I usually turn in all of my work unless I happen to forget. This time, I knew it was due. I knew it would affect my grade. It's the last week of the quarter. I still didn't turn it in. I didn't do my two other homework assignments either. I've been procrastinating a lot more recently. It's not unusual for me to procrastinate. It's just gotten worse. I should be doing homework as I'm typing this but I really don't care about it right now.

I constantly feel like I just annoy people. Like my friends don't really care. I always feel stupid. I always think I make a fool out of myself. I always think I bother people. I turn good experiences into bad ones because I ruminate on them. There's just a constant swirl of thoughts running through my head and I can't stop them.

Do these sound like signs of a mental disorder? Again I am NOT attempting to diagnose myself through Reddit. I am just wondering if there is possibly something wrong, or if I am just overreacting.",03Nov2019,1
195,"It's crazy, I can't just relax on my way home from uni or just sit in the class listening to the prof. All the time it's just constant calculations of what that dude on the seat near me or what that girl on the other end of the room thinks of me after she saw me sit down or take out my phone out or take a sip from the water bottle.

Every minute that I spend outside my room and around people I spend on trying to as perfectly as possible imagine what others think of what I do, how I look, even of what my posture is at that particular moment.

I can't do normal daily tasks! Not to mention I can't even imagine taking my phone out and texting someone or going on reddit, I'm way too worried about what kind of a person I'll appear as in the other people's heads, even if noone could possibly see my phone screen.
I deeply believe that this is an abnormal way of thinking.

Sometimes I try to imagine that there's nobody around me, that I'm in a conpletely empty classroom or street or train, and it hepls! But it doesn't last long, I can't concentrate on this sort of meditation for a long time, and the obsessive calculations just come back.

Oftentimes I try to go against those thoughts and just do the normal things that I don't want to do as to not attract anyone's attention. I am forced to do them, because otherwise I wouldn't be able to drink or move or change my sitting position in public. It doesn't help. If I manage to do something even crazier (go on reddit, start to crochet on the train, stand up and open the window) the calculations in my head get even crazier.

Can you give me any tips on how to handle this? I'm generally a shy type, and by that I mean avoiding eye contact and not talking in groups of more than 2 people and all of that. Does this have to do with that? 
What should I be working on? I really hope I'll be able to combat this.
Thanks to this subreddit, at least I had a chance to express my confusion and not hide it within myself! &lt;3",03Nov2019,1
196,"Hey. 

I've been to my therapist around 15 or so times now. Give or take. She called in a psychiatrist to her clinic, and I'm now diagnosed with depression, schizophrenia and anxiety. I feel like now even though I have my diagnosis, I just go to her to vent and complain about my life. I have so many things in my life that can use helping or fixing. I'm only 16 and I have all this stuff diagnosed to me. When is she going to start helping me get better? I'm kind of tired of feeling like utter shit every day of my life, and only going to her to complain about said utter shit. I want a fix. When will she help me fix it?",03Nov2019,6
197,"The title may be worded oddly but I don't know how else to say it. Long story short, I've just recently gone through a tough breakup from a relationship that I was in for almost 3 years. We lived together for virtually all of that time and as such, we got extremely close and some would say dependent on each other for company and life in general. I used to be an introvert that loved time alone, but now I find I have too much time on my hands but not enough motivation to do anything.

How can I recover that sense of peace with being alone, and any tips for dealing with post-breakup motivation-loss/sadness? It wasn't necessarily mutual but I would say it was all ultimately for the best for both of us.",03Nov2019,14
