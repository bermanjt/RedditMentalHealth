0,"My life is falling apart. I’m (24m) going through a breakup with my girlfriend of 4 years, whom
I thought was the love of my life. My mental
Health has been deteriorating since I graduated high school nearly 7 years ago. I suffer from bipolar type 2 and it seems like the depressive states are far more common than the hypomanic states these days. 

Just last month before I got laid off, I was working in a coker unit at an oil refinery and regularly spent time about 500 feet in the air for my job. And every time I’d go to the elevator or the stairs to make my descent to the bottom, I’d catch myself looking over the railings when no one was around. I’d be looking at the vac trucks, pipe racks, and the concrete jungle below, and think about jumping. Sometimes I’d go into a trance for 4-5 minutes just staring over the edge until another worker I knew walked by and said “hey hows it going!”, not thinking anything of me looking over the railing thinking of suicide I guess, just thinking I was enjoying the view and taking a short break as was not uncommon for people to do up there. 

Then I’d snap out of it but the suicidal ideation is always there. I’d be standing in a structure and see a crane approaching and think “why can’t you just fall asleep? Hit the structure with the crane. Send me to my death”. We had an incident where a crane hit a scaffold about 400 feet in the air with 5 scaffolders working on it (no one died thank god), and it stuck with me for a really long time. Every time I’d go up there on that same scaffold id stop and watch the crane. And when no one else was around I just hoped the operator fucked up again. Maybe a little harder this time and send the scaffolding plummeting to the concrete below. 

Now I’m laid off because the job ended and I’m constantly wishing for death. I go out for a cigarette and just wish someone would walk around the corner in a botched home invasion, get startled, and shoot me dead. When I’m walking to the store I see vehicles pass and think “fall asleep. Just do it. Fall asleep at the wheel and run me the fuck over”. 

I don’t want to kill myself. I wouldn’t be able to put a gun to my head and pull the trigger. I tried hanging myself once about 4-5 years ago and failed and ever since then I realized I don’t have it in me to commit suicide. 

However, I’m constantly praying for an accident of some sort. When I get back to work in November maybe a gas leak. I’d be dead before I knew it. Or maybe someone drop a wrench from the tallest structure while I’m standing below and it split my head clean in two. 

Please help me. How do I stop this. I don’t want to kill myself but I don’t want to live and I’m terrified of that. I’m completely unafraid of death and if it were to come for me I’d embrace it with open arms. 

I got incredibly drunk the other night while taking Valium and suboxone and I literally lost the ability to walk. I crawled downstairs to my bed, puked in the bathroom, and what did I do? I went to sleep in my bed, on my back, hoping to not see the morning. Somebody help me. 

Tl;dr - I don’t want to kill myself but I don’t want to live. I fantasize about death constantly and am unafraid of dangerous things which used to scare me.",28Oct2019,1
1,I just can't seem to get emotional shit up wraps and it keeps coming back to me and I've thought suicide alot lately but I can't kill myself yet because it would  hurt my mum so much so when she's dies I can just go meet her in death but at this rate I can't handle emotions,28Oct2019,1
2,"I’m a freshman in college (19F) and I’ve been struggling a lot with the transition, more than I cared to admit. But last week, I completed a mental health screening on a whim and spoke with a counselor about what I’ve been feeling recently. She scheduled me for an intake appointment, and I feel so much better.

Acknowledging the feelings of loneliness and isolation I’ve been experiencing was so relieving, and I feel like my life has already brightened in the few days since then. I feel lighter, I laugh more easily, and I’ve been less inclined to stay in bed all day. 

My dad doesn’t approve of my decision to enter therapy, which has been the source of my hesitation for years, but now that I’m in a position to act on my mental health independently of him, I finally gained the courage to. 

I’m really proud of myself. I just wanted to share that here. (:",28Oct2019,1
3,I don't want to die but I don't want to be here. I don't want anyone's love or affection. I don't want friends anymore. I don't need acceptance. I don't need anyone to tell me I'm a good person. I don't want to do anything anymore because what's the point. Life is shit and so are people. I don't want attention. I just want peace. An escape from my fucked up mind.,28Oct2019,2
4,"I’ve been depressed now for a couple months, its been a rough year, the hardest of my life, and I can’t get up from bed at the moment, I haven’t really eaten either, any advice thats helped them push themselves?",28Oct2019,1
5,"Hello, I've had a really rough last few years dealing with depression. I've had only a few highs that only crashed back down into suicidal thoughts. I reached a breaking point at the end of August and since then I have felt like I've had the life sucked out of me. I feel so numb most of the time which has helped me work on trying to better my life but I still feel almost nothing. I've always felt helpless being so down so I'm glad I'm able to start working on myself but deep down I feel like I want to break down and cry. The feeling is distant though but I know it'll resurface eventually. I don't know what to do, it's like I'm just floating through life right now.",28Oct2019,1
6,"My mother constantly says that I won't care when she dies and that I won't miss her. She also expects me to spend time with her but when I have time, she makes plans with someone else and leaves. She guilt trips me a lot and is very passive aggressive. I get called ignorant and cocky all the time and she does exactly what she tells me not to do.

Is this some form of abuse?

I don't know if this is the best subreddit for a question like this; but this is one I've visited before so I figured I'd give it a shot. 

Thank you for your time",28Oct2019,1
7,"So I've been told by several friends that I have depression and I've gone to therapy and everything but I still don't believe that there could be something legitimately wrong with me and that I'm not just attention-seeking.

And by making this reddit post, it's just adding to my belief that I'm attention-seeking but I'm gonna suck it up and see what you guys think.

For over two years, I've had the same kinda empty, not exactly sad but definitely not happy feeling that I just can't seem to shake. I feel like I'm alone and I feel like no one cares about me. I've never been a big fan of talking about my problems with anyone except maybe one or two very close friends because I always feel like I'm bothering people. It started to get worse and worse about a year ago, to the point where doing simple things like getting out of bed in the morning had no appeal anymore. My grades sank, my social life was almost zero, and I was terrified that if I said something, I'd be told the same thing I was telling myself; it's nothing, let it go. A friend staged what they called an ""intervention"" and told my parents, who sent me to therapy immediately. I went to therapy for a few months, but nothing got any better and so we stopped paying. I started dating someone, and I got better, but then after we broke up I got worse again.

Starting this year, I've had this overwhelming dislike for anything social. Even ordering at restaurants is difficult now because I'm so convinced that I'm wasting people's time or that I'm annoying. That feeling kinda fed into the emptiness that was already there, and I don't know what to call it or what to do.

So I'm gonna leave this here and hope someone can give me input. Thanks for reading my rant.",28Oct2019,1
8,"To start off, I was never this type of person but actually quite the opposite. I would shut myself off so much in the past and not want to know what people think of me, or ever wanna hear feedback about, say, a talent/hobby I have, a speech I gave, etc. I think that deep down the reason for this was actually fear of what I may hear or to put it better, perhaps I didn't wanna be dissatisfied and/or needing more.


Down the line though and nowadays, I've changed quite a bit and feel free to express myself more openly than before. But I have a serious problem. I am naturally not very confident in myself and my abilities, and even if I do something perfectly, I still downplay it and find something wrong with it. So, recently, as I have gotten closer and more open with people, I constantly need validation of any sort. It's annoying and they must notice how insecure I am but I can't help myself but ask questions of how they percieve me, how they think others perceive me, etc. I constantly need to hear that I am a good friend or something. That I am talented. Or that I am good looking. I need to hear something
Otherwise, I won't know what's real or what's not and I'll keep wondering ""Am I good enough?"".
I feel like it's eating away at me how I stay waiting for a some sort of compliment or validation every now and then. I am tired of it. I am tired of being this way. I don't wanna keep needing to hear something from people. I want this voice to come from within not from others.

Although, others' criticism and perception of you as a person obviously matters to give you an idea of where you are at, but I think I am taking it too extremely upon myself.

How do I overcome this?",28Oct2019,2

10,"All I ever think about is death or dying, I fall asleep in tears and wake up exhausted with life, wanting to close my eyes and fade back into the black nothingness. I smile and joke with people but I'm just mimicking their emotions, my mind is blank and I have no emotion when I'm alone, I've turned to drug use to make myself happy, but I don't even want to do that, it just doesn't seem rewarding and I stopped almost right after I started, I mean I still use substances but not for trying to make myself happier, its more so that I just want to feel in general. I find myself wrapping belts around my neck and staring aimlessly into the corner of my room debating if the risk of survival is even worth the effort, I don't understand why I am this way, I have money, friends, and pretty much anything I could want but it all seems pointless, like someone else could put it to better use, I don't recognize myself anymore and I haven't for a while, mirrors make me uncomfortable, any movement, shift in light, or blinking and I'm staring at a new face, taller, thinner, more feminine, more masculine,shorter, fatter, its like staring into a crowd and recognizing faces from a distance, except they're all vastly different and different people and yet somehow still me, my eyes don't feel like my own, I constantly feel like I'm watching a shitty first person movie where everything looks a little too real to actually be real, I've given up, I don't want to be happy, I don't want to live but at the same time I don't want to die or be unhappy, I just don't want to BE",28Oct2019,1
11,"This is going to be ranty and probably confusing but I need help.

So I (f20) don't know where to begin. I recently (3 months ago) got a job at the local shelter and I love my job. Or did I'm not sure. But about a week ago my cousin(f21) and her baby(m8 months) died and we were reallyyyy close when we were kids (till freshman year which was about 6 years ago, we still saw each other a lot tho). I cry constantly and I don't enjoy my job anymore, I've called in multiple times and my boss is cool with it because she knew both of us on high school. I feel shitty for doing it though but I can barely bring myself to do anything. 
Before I got my job I was very depressed and constantly thought about just ending it. After I got my job I started getting better but had some habits stick. Like not brushing my hair/teeth everyday (sometimes only once every two weeks) and I would  feel disgusting but I just couldn't do it. I still struggle with depression. I also haven't selfharmed in years but I think about it a lot, not because of my cousin just my shittyness. I also think about popping pills and anything that can just make me not think. 
I just feel like I'm so overwhelmed by everything and the smallest thing could push me too far. But on the bright side I have a friend(f24) that talks to me and helps me not think a lot of the time we talk. 

So ig what I'm saying is what do I do from here? Like my job ik is a big part of why I feel this way (I work 11 hours 4 days a week). The people are not the best except my boss. Also my cousins death is the first death I've ever had to deal with. I just feel like my life is spinning out of control and I can't stop it.",28Oct2019,4

13,"I can’t do it. I just can’t. 

I feel as though the world around me is crumbling and I will fall into the deepest, darkest pit of despair if I do nothing to stop it. 

The problem with this is, is that my life is great. I have a wide and varied friendship group, that is ever expanding. I’m doing well in school and I’m actually studying things I love. I’ve never had a more diverse and active social life. So why do I feel like this? I love life, I love living. The very thought of being alive is wonderful to me. But there’s one small problem. I don’t want to be alive. But I don’t want to die either, because the fruits of life are too sweet, yet they are bitter too. So do I just leave life? Do I just throw in the towel, because my brain tells me my life is worthless? I feel stuck in my body. The body of an awkward, overweight, socially inept teenager. I hate this! I can’t even feel love anymore. I feel so numb and bitter and anxious ALL OF THE DAMN TIME. And I’m so goddamn sensitive too. One small rebuke, and I’m gone. It’s not like I can’t handle criticism, yet when I get some, my whole being is filled with worries. I feel as though all my friends hate me, even though I *know* they don’t. I also feel so much tension everywhere I go. No matter what I do, no matter how hard I try, I always, constantly, inevitable feel like shit. My brain tells me to die, while my heart tells me that I love life, and that, to leave this world prematurely, would be a mistake. 

So, why do I feel like this?! I don’t understand!

I've been dating this girl for the past two years and recently last summer I've developed extreme anxiety when I've been around her.

18,"Hi 
Im pretty much your run of the mill depressed  millennial that's wasting away and doesn't know what to do. Also don't really know punctuation and English ist not my first language so you know the drill. 20 btw.

Let's start with basic information about myself: 
Born '99, am 20 right now finished school with a 2.8, solid average or sth. Started uni, dropped out 2 years after, turns out I didn't like coding, I just liked games.

Now to major points why I hate my life: 
Biggest of all propably my body.
Appearancewise I'd say I'm satisfied, I like my face, am rather tall, can grow a beard and all that so that's good B U T nothing fucking works in this piece of shit. I've got neurodermitis (?) And psoriasis, so basically my skin is dry as frick an covered in smaller wounds that always itch and while you sleep you carve open how ever much your sleeping brain wants in that night, which can range from nothing to my whole belly bleeding, my hands are covered in that blood, t shirt is red blah blah it sucks ass. I'm on the 4th medicine my doc gave me that should work wonders that I can't see (but it's only been a few weeks so it can still happen). And it can itch everywhere so you can think your part why that sucks. Plus I can't live in my room for 1 week without dead skin piling up everywhere I sit my  keyboard is fucking disgusting but I can't be be fucked to clean it every second day.
Then my left eye doesn't work properly and I wore glasses for the most part of my life but stopped doing that because I didn't like how it looks, my right eye is okay though that's why I didn't deem it necessary to wear glasses. Also haven't been to the eye doc person in a few years so y'know.
My ears can't properly (erase, decrease) the wax it produces so that blocks them up from time to time.
Tinnitus on the left ear. 
Main problem is the skin thing but the best thing is that basically it's just my fault for not caring which is another problem: 
I can not give a flying frick about myself I'm basically not a person or at least I don't think of myself as one just because I don't think I'm worth it. I basically exist for others, can't stand up for myself, I don't care about my room, lately I've stopped caring about my body because I'm just hanging around at home with a nice depression beard going on. 

The gaming: 
After my parents divorced when I was 4 5 6 or so I spent the weekends at my father's where I got in touch with it, unreal tournament at the age of 7 btw, which turned out ok I don't think of myself as a violent person, but rather I think I've seen some shit at my dad's that really scarred me (movies, games and the lot)  but growing up with a bleeding body that wasn't really the problem. Contact with father was cut because we really disliked his new wife now he sends a Christmas and birthday card and that's that chapter. At first it the classic 30 mins a day at my mom's then an hour but we played at night and when she was gone in secret anyways so that didn't work. Once I got my own pc it just went downhill to the point where I addicted and spent the entire day until night gaming and on the internet. Never learned how to work because I was ""too good"" in the early grades. 
I could go on on how my mother used to beat us when we were younger but stopped because she realized what she was doing, then about my brother who ran from home at 16 years (3 years older than me) and has since then waged war with my mother basically. Or my ex that basically degraded me for everything I said and did because she didn't know how to deal with humans because her family was shit as well and that relationship being one sided because I was too emotional for the rational person in front of me and so on and so on. But the main reason why I'm writing this is because I just want it to stop, thought about suicide for way too many years but I can't go through with it because I'm ""too much of a pussy"" maybe it's better that way, who knows. I kind of want to live but also don't, I want to get out of this body and actually not waste away.
But I can't do anything on my own and my question for help in applying for a job was beautifully forgotten in this one week my mom had to stay at home because of an illness where she actually had time to do anything except working. Now we're here at the end if anyone even read through it I don't know, whatever maybe maybe not.",28Oct2019,1

Thanks, I'm honestly scaring myself too. I've been struggling with Mental Health recently. I don't know if I have depression but I've been becoming, well depressed recently. The reason I don't know is because, well I'm arguing with myself, I'm trying to deny it, and that only makes it worse. I don't want to tell my friends and family because I'm afraid that I'd needlessly worry them. I'm developing an avid self-hate calling myself a fake, and saying I don't have these problems. I don't know what to believe any more. I can't trust myself. I don't know if I'm warping my perceptions. I can't even trust my senses, I'm starting taste lemons at certain cues, the c sound in rice (I don't know the proper term for it), when I get scared (like when I went to Haunted House last week), I'm in such a major self-arguement that I can't even trust the arguement. I don't know if I have Mental Health or not, and I dare not tell my family and friends about it until I'm sure, and possibly not even then. It's tearing me apart, I don't know what to trust when it comes to myself, and it's an endless cycle. Me screaming at myself, forcing myself through mental and real life agony. I've even started to wish for death. I'm scaring myself too, and I want to tell my family and friends, but I can't, I can't work up the courage. I don't want to burden them. I've suspected that I've have something wrong with me for a while, but now I'm even more unsure. I can't describe really how I feel, I just want to scream sometimes. I'm slamming my head into the wall when nobody else is around. I also have read the requirements for being diagnosted with PTSD and I've met all of them, but part of me, my angry side is telling me that I'm probably just warping my reality once again, I'm doing this a lot recently. I'm scared, I don't know whether I'm fine or not. Do you guys think I have a Mental Health problem, I won't go to anybody until I'm sure. After that, if I do I need to work up the courage. Please be honest with me. I know I haven't done a very good job describing what's going on, but this is as far as I dare, I don't know what I'm forcing upon myself, and what's real.

29,"I'm in a weird spot in life right now. I'm living with my estranged wife. Most of the time she isn't here, she's with family or friends, but when she is here, we tend to argue a lot. My (ex?) wife can be really critical of me at times, but usually I deserve it. I have autism, and it makes me seem like I'm careless. She has overall been very understanding about the way my head works (she too has mental health issues). The issue I'm having is, whenever she gets frustrated at me, I lose my cool. I don't go hit her or anything, but I'm verbally abusive. She got frustrated with me today over something and raised her voice at me. I am extremely ashamed but when she started to raise her voice even a little I yelled and said ""fuck you!"" and called her a ""stupid bitch."" I am incredibly ashamed. Whenever she raises her voice I get like this. I realized that her raising her voice is a trigger for me. I hope it doesn't sound like this happens frequently, but it has happened more than once. The therapist I've been seeing is incredibly enabling of this behavior. And I mean, I'm not thinking I know more than a therapist does, but any time I mention it, she says things like ""I don't think that's really you. You shout as a reaction to being shouted at."" Or something similar, and it doesn't help. I don't want to be told I'm an angel or even that I'm a victim. This poor person is being verbally abused by me. I don't want to be an abuser. I'm deeply ashamed of some of the things I've said to this poor woman. I want to know how I can work through this. I don't want to lose my cool when anybody gets frustrated at me. Nobody deserves that. I understand now when I'm level headed that I need to just relax and listen, and understand people get frustrated sometimes.

It’s not like I hate my job, the company is great and my coworkers are supportive and fantastic. I know there are consequences for my actions (or inaction) but just I couldn't bring myself to care enough to leave and go in. I don’t think I'm depressed because I’m not really sad or suicidal.

Should I be seeing someone about this or am I just lazy and bored with my life?

TL;DR I’ve been acting super irresponsible lately and i don't know why. Is there something wrong with me?",28Oct2019,5

I've had full on tic attacks where they won't stop for 10 Minutes to a hour. They don't stop until my body can't take it anymore then it will stop for a day tops if I'm lucky then it's back again. I can't stop it and I don't know how. Is it all in my head? I shake too, I can't stop that either. I've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety when I was young and just recently been diagnosed with social anxiety. My social anxiety has been getting worse lately as well. I've been avoiding activities and hanging out with friends. I tried going to a party but ended up sitting in the corner then crying in the bathroom. I constantly have anxiety attacks. I've tried meditation and I've tried therapy many times and it never helps. I refuse to take pills even if I could afford them. Is there any help for me or am I just going to have to live like this till I die.
I also just make myself more stressed by procrastinating. If anyone can give me any tips on controlling generalized anxiety, social anxiety, or procrastination please let me know.

34,"Quick backstory: I feel like it’s so silly now.. I don’t know. I feel alone here. My mom wasn’t the best mom growing up. She did try a lot with us, being a single mother and all, but she was also emotionally and physically abusive. And my grandmother wasn’t any better. She was emotionally abusive as well. And heh often teamed up to make fun of me or call me awful things. Worst part is, my mom would act like she didn’t say it, confusing me further, or calling me sensitive. But anyway.. back to the present moment. I forgot to clean the house today, and my mom got justifiably angry. She told me I was useless and she doesn’t want to be my mom, that she wishes I’d leave and she’d be fine if she never sees me again. And that really hurts my feelings, you know? She never gets so angry when my oldest brother does the same thing, and he has, twice before, but I guess since my mom and my grandmother respect him more, they never get mad at him for it. And my oldest brother hates me for some reason so it feels even more like they’re teaming up against me. I got really frustrated with her, and how she’s always acting whenever she’s angry, I told her she was emotionally unavailable and she said she’s tired of helping me because I frustrate her more than anyone. She’s referring to the five or six years we were both dealing with my mental disorders. She’s done this many times before, this isn’t new. Maybe it’s worth mentioning she’s pregnant? And she’s going through a lot. 

I thought about moving in with my auntie. Because this isn’t doing any good for me. But I refuse to leave my three dogs behind. It’s enough asking my auntie if I can live with her, let alone if my three dogs can. I don’t know.. maybe I should rehome them, to make it easier for me to leave.. I don’t know if I’m posting this in the right place at allll.. but if you have any subreddit suggestions that’ll best fit this then I’d be happy to hear it. Thank you",28Oct2019,1
35," 

I'm finding it so hard to enjoy my life, not in the way like everything sucks, in fact, I'm normally a spunky person but I go through day to day execting nothing different and receive nothing different. I have a good life I mean my past was messed up but now I have a good family situation, have a roof over my head, good grades, friends, a boyfriend and everything a person could possibly want but I feel so alone.

I have been diagnosed with severe anxiety, depression and panic disorder, and my therapist and psychologist suspect I might have schizophrenia. I'm on a high dose of medication, have a therapist and have healthy habits and at first, I had a lot of hope for my future but it's all getting blurry as these weird feelings and distance from the rest of the world continues, it seems to only be getting worse despite my efforts to fight it. Now I'll say I'm not suicidal though, have been in the past. After overdosing I have no desire to put myself through that again.

I feel so alone and confused, I can always give good advice to other's and it works but for some reason can't fix myself. I really honestly feel like no ones really here for me, I don't have a really strong connection with anyone, now don't get me wrong I love people but I just feel so distant from them. Life is becoming hard to live and I'm not going to end it but I don't want to continue to live this way.",28Oct2019,1

37,"I know this is long but bare with me please:

So I am a 26 year old who has never committed to a full time job. I graduated college with the highest honors but I've had a problem committing to full time job. I've always tried to avoid full time work as it feels like its not worth it. I feel like I am having a commitment issue at this point in my life. I've been wanting to have my own business but I jump around so many ideas to the point that I never commit to one idea, so nothing actually came to fruition. I did an internship in my field the summer before the last one and although I didn't like the work, I liked the people and felt that they also liked me. My boss offered me his position and I declined.

This past summer, I applied to a job. I wasn't sure if I would like it. I was excited when I got the call to make an appointment to interview. During the interview, I did fine but I feel like I could have done much better. I was somewhat not trying my best on purpose. Right before leaving the interview, the manager told me the usual: we have to interview someone else tomorrow and we will let you know. I almost knew that I wasn't going to get an offer based on body language and what not and this made me feel good actually. Most people would feel bad if they thought they wouldn't get an offer but I actually felt good. I felt free knowing this.

I've been working these ""Temporary"" jobs in the same hospital that gave me internships since I was in high school. I have had two ""temporary"" jobs. I say ""temporary"" because they aren't really temporary in the direct definition of the word. They are jobs that many people use to get their foot in the hospital, you can leave after 3 months work but you don't have to stay long. They were two jobs. The first was watching patients who are suicidal or have some abnormal psych problem. The second is basically customer service for the docs and nurses. Both jobs are the type of jobs that might be chill one minute and bat shit cray the next. These 2 jobs that I had in the hospital since graduating university are the type of jobs that really lead no where but the thing was that I was able to choose the shift and the days that I could work. I worked mostly part time as they were stressful.

Now again I have the opportunity to work fulltime in my brothers lab in the same hospital. He really wants me to work with them. He is a research engineer and I would start as a research tech. I am not sure if I would be able to work this job. I feel that I interned in almost everything in this hospital except the research/laboratories. He told me about a possible opening about a month ago and when it opened a couple days ago. I felt like crap when he told me that it opened. I want to pursue but at the same time, it feels like a heavy load. It almost feels as though I'm giving up on my entrepreneurial dreams. If I don't join I'm going to be staying at this job that allows me to choose my schedule and leave for as long as I want to (I left for three months to travel before).

The other piece is that my brother and I can get at each others throat sometimes. I'm afraid that this might cause a problem at work sometimes, although he seems happier when I see him at work then when I see him at home so not sure how this would play out. I've considered not taking this job and going to a different country to teach English, but I also feel like I might get disappointed later on and ask myself the what if later on as these lab positions don't come every day but teaching English will be there for a long time.

At this point, I want to take the job and if I don't like it then just suck it up and stick it out for a total of 6-7 months and then leave. My brother told me that he might leave in the next 8-12 months as he has been there for over 2 years and learned most of the stuff. What should I do?????",28Oct2019,2

I am a quiet person and i dont have any people i consider my friend at school. But today we where just playing a group game i was forced to be part of.

40,"I was having a mental breakdown and she called the cops on me. We had just gotten out of urgent care and I was having a really stressful day, I wanted to go over to my boyfriend’s house to relax and she wouldn’t let me. I’m 17 so legally I can’t just go wherever I want to. The argument got heated and my hands tensed up so hard I destroyed the turkey sandwich and applesauce that she got me from the hospital cafeteria, splattering the food all over car. Surprised and pissed at myself, I flung the door open and leaned against a nearby wall while hyperventilating. I eventually decided to walk myself tired and my mom just walked behind me. I walked about a block and a half before I decided to turn around because of I saw some people. My mom still behind me told me to sit down but instead I just started running because I still wasn’t tired. I tripped but got up and kept running in the direction of where the car was. By this time she was on the phone with the cops. I caught up to the car and yelled if we could leave, she was standing about 20ft away like she was scared of me. I looked into the car and saw the mess I made and started hyperventilating again while resting my head against the window. Another car while this was happening parked in front of ours and I could hear the people laughing at me as they got out which made me hyperventilate more. Suddenly there was an officer next to me asking if I was ok and asked if I wanted to sit down. I told her that I wanted to leave and that I would calm down once my mom and I left. She told me that my mom was talking to the other officer. I urged her to tell my mom to hurry up, and she just stood there. After begging her again to notify my mom to let us leave, she yelled at me and said “she’s doing her job, let me do mine.” Her job was supposed to be calming me down but the harsh tone just made my anxiety attack worse. Suddenly the other officer was there and they were both telling me that I needed to “act like an adult”, “stop faking”, and “stop being disrespectful”. At this point I was like, “Can I just go tell my mom I want to leave?” and they said I had to walk up to her and tell her RESPECTFULLY. I just let out a small “can we please go?”. The officers suggested they watch me while she cleans her car. I finally sat down on the gravel in a ball just tearing up and breathing erratically. I stood up to try and help my mom go clean the car, and one of the officers thrusted me back down and said “you’re not going anywhere”. I asked them if I could help because it was my mess and they wouldn’t let me, they said “life goes a lot easier when you just follow directions”. Eventually we got everything sorted out and they let us go home but, the cops just made everything worse. What they were saying was very akin to what my mom usually says to me in those situations and my anxiety just feels way worse now because it feels like the verbal abuse my mom has said about me throughout my childhood has been validated. I understand why she called the cops; she was scared I was going to hurt myself but, now I just want to hurt myself even more. My fear of authority has now been amplified 10x.",28Oct2019,20
41,"I know you guys aren’t medical professionals and can’t diagnose me through reddit, but can you at least tell me if I seem like I have BPD?

Some days I’m super happy and can’t stop talking. I love to be around my parents and I love to give them hugs and just spread happiness. This really annoys them and they tell me to leave them alone but it hard to stop. It’s like an impulse. 

Some days I’m so angry or sad and I don’t know why. I’ll wake up in a terrible mood and I’ll hate myself to the point where I wanna die. I don’t wanna talk to anyone or go anywhere. I yell at my parents and then feel even worse afterwards. I feel evil and I punish myself even more for it. 

One day I completely didn’t talk to anyone because my dad yelled at me for something small the day before. I just cried the whole day. I almost committed suicide that day. I felt like nothing. I was just alive and I didn’t know why. I felt like my family secretly hated me and everything I did. 

my mood improves and I feel normal again when exercising and eating healthy but if I stop or if I feel like I’m not doing anything to better myself it starts all over again.


I think about suicide a lot when I’m feeling angry or sad but I remember how my family will feel and I don’t do it. Also I know it’s wrong but sometimes I feel like people would be better off without me. I think my parents secretly wish I moved out so I could stop annoying them. Especially my mom. I randomly cry sometimes because I’m so unhappy with myself. This year has just been all around terrible and I don’t want to go to a psychiatrist. I just want to be alone, but at the same time I don’t want to be alone :( 

Also I know BPD have a favorite person, I don’t know if I have a FP? I mean I had a crush on a guy once for like 6 months and I did everything to try to impress him. But in a way where it wasn’t obvious. I talked about him constantly and when we wouldn’t talk I would get depressed and didn’t wanna talk or be around anyone. I don’t know if that’s normal or not. I also thought about him a lot.He had a girlfriend too and that made me feel even worse about myself. In no way was I obsessed with him, I pretty sure he had no clue I liked him. I’m very closed off and shy. Sometime I would also hate him if he did something that made me sad. Like flirt unintentionally with girls. And then he would talk to me and I wouldn’t hate him anymore. I would try to find reasons to hate him or like him. But these feelings come and go and I don’t really consider that a FP more of a normal but crazy crush that I had on a guy.

I am days behind in my English class and I also haven’t started my college application essays.

Like, in the 50s low. This was after several minutes of being awake, but not up. My lips felt oddly cold, and I was a little fuzzy headed. As the day went on, things returned to normal(bpm in the high 60s-low 70s). Now, however, my bpm if sketchily high. I'm sitting down and it's in the high 80s. When I stand up and walk around, it spikes even higher. My chest is sort of tight, and I feel like my breaths aren't providing the oxygen that they should.

49,"I had what I would consider a difficult childhood and something that I told myself quite often as a child was that I was going to die in my early twenties. I didn't know how and I've never thought about ending my own life but I was just very familiar with this thought and had accepted it. Possibly I created my whole mental framework around this, ingrained in my reality because it's been difficult recently to make adult decisions like choosing a major in college because I never thought about having a career, never bothered to think about being something when I would grow up. Everything was a game and the consequences were not that monumental.

It wasn't a very complex thought but it was something that I've carried with me for a good 15 years now: I'm going to die before my early twenties, before I would graduate college at 23. I'm going to get morbidly obese and (not necessarily as a consequence) die. 

It might also be important to say that was very sick as a kid and when I got into college I was in such poor health they tried very very adamantly to put me on medical leave for a year or two. when I was coming into college I was sleeping like 18 hours a day and digestion was exhausting to me. I was scary underweight and high risk anemic and suffering all of the symptoms of undiagnosed celiac disease. I think in some way I was dying through my childhood.

A month ago I turned 20 and I've been thinking about this a lot. I was comfortable with death and it didn't bother me one bit but now (since my birthday) I feel uncomfortable, specifically I'm afraid that I might not die early. I'm in much better health. 

That said I'm coming out of what had been a very hard year and beginning to feel happy and satisfied and alive again. But at the same time I'm not sure if this happiness that I feel is just a facade and underneath is a serious long term mental illness, that I'm not happy but I'm mentally unwell.

Is there a normal amount of passively wanting to die that most people experience? I cant tell if I'm depressed or not. Since high school (I'm 28F now) I've had some level of suicidal thoughts. Back then it was a stronger urge that I acted on twice (surprise, I'm still here), but lately with work and real life, I have a constant feeling of passively wanting to not be alive. The amount I feel that way varies, sometimes it's not much at all and sometimes it's like I would be okay if I died in some freak accident, and when I feel really overwhelmed and like everything is falling apart, feels like that could definitely be an out but only if things actually do fall apart (they never have).

60,"Suicidal/self harm ideation (thankfully) is beginning to be spoken about in regards to mental health. Tonight I'm having my own  crisis, and it's truly amazing knowing I can now admit that publicly without the stigma I had as a teen. 

However one thing that's less open to public discussion yet is a prominent part of depression, and many mental health disorders, isn't ideation of self harm but the ideation of violence/homicide on others. Whether or not it's acted upon.

And we need to start having this discussion. 

If people are able to open up about these ideations without the threat of ridicule or even imprisonment and criminal cases then we'd actually go a long way to preventing a lot of violence such as mass shootings. It's also an early warning sign of psychosis, which could help people attain relevant help and aid before crises occur.

Just over a year ago I experienced a breakdown which left me nearing as an alcoholic, becoming reckless, skipping work and thinking about dying on a daily occurrence.

71,"Hi, I don't know if this is the right place to post this here but I'll try. 

So I'm 19M, introvert, melancholic and I've never had any major problems in my life - family, friends, hobbies, my body...everything's okay. But like 3 years ago, for no reason, I started to feel really sad, hopeless and very pessimistic.   
I lost interest in my hobbies - I stopped doing sport (this totally surprised me), going out, learning about some things I've liked, I even stopped playing video games.   
Somehow it got better with time but mostly I'm not as happy as I used to be.

However, like 10 months ago, I've noticed one thing - my mood started to change almost every day. I'm also a more sensitive person now. My mood changes very often and it's not like a bad mood when something happens to you, but more like mania and depression as I read. The mania period is never super crazy or something like that. The depression part is sometimes very bad.

The last couple of months became even more interesting for me - my mood really changes several times a day. Some days are crazy it feels like a rollercoaster. And again it happens for no reason, it also doesn't matter if I'm alone or not and the mania period, how I've mentioned earlier, is never totally crazy (big).   
I read a couple of articles about bipolar disorder and there was always something about one state in which your mood changes daily or several times a day. Maybe it's called 'mixed episodes' but I'm sure. 

I really don't see any reason why my mood is changing like that so I'm trying to figure it out.  
Could this be a bipolar disorder?  

 \- btw. I hate when someone says he has a mental health problem just for attention or because of it 'cool' or cause someone is trying to find an excuse. I'm just trying to understand myself like what is going on with me because I think it's very important. This whole bipolar feeling is ofc affecting my daily life a lot, so I wanna know if this could be some kind of disorder? Yeah, I should maybe visit a psychiatrist (Idk if it is the right term in English) but I don't feel like doing it right now.

72," 

It has almost been 3 months since I made the shift. I can’t even begin to describe how many things feel better to me now but I, personally, am not feeling so good. And I don’t know why. I’ve been trying to cry from so many days and it’s scary that I just couldn’t. I googled it- on an average basis women cry 5 times a month and I hadn’t at all cried for about three. It’s definitely not something I’m proud of. I’ve also not had a real laugh in a very long time and only I know how bad I want to laugh so hard that I tear up. It irritates me when I hear my sisters constantly laughing on the phone and how they’re just not able to stop. I’ve always been the jealous kind and maybe some things would never change. I absolutely despise going on about a day like a rock. I don’t have things to talk about. I constantly measure my words before speaking and still regret them after I do. I go on all day without laughing, no crying, not creating art, not writing, not singing and dancing around, not entertaining people, not even an actual conversation and it makes me feel like a huge part of me is dead now, because this not how am. I have never been this way. I have always been the light of my home, the entertainer of the family, the joker of the class, the lunatic on the street, and the scary one because she is just happy with herself.

It has been a cruel past month and I have to remind myself that in writing because I forget. Everyday, my emotional balance is being degraded gradually and I still continue to act like nothing happened. ‘It’s fine’ is what I have become. But you know what? Its not. It’s not fucking fine and I need to remind myself that. After all this blankness, fucking advertisements are making me tear up. I tried to take those moments of emotional opening to actually cry but I can’t bring myself to sob, to verbalize and let out all the mess that’s in my head. It’s just not happening.

I watched Ritviz’s ‘sage’ music video today and it suddenly hit me. That guy found someone who appreciated him, the one who took in account of the things that were small but made a huge difference without even him verbalizing it and that made his usual bad days seem better. I have become optimistic as usual but then again I’m sad too because I know it’s not happening to me. I will obviously go on but I don’t know how. I will make it but I’m also tired. I have no fucking friends. I did get habituated to that so why does it affect me now? It’s so confusing. I want to be alone, I really do, but I’m tired of being alone. I want to be loved. I want someone to hug me even when I act like nothing affected me because even though I will never show it, they will know. I want someone to not laugh at me but with me. I really want someone to make me laugh but most of all I really want someone to make me cry. 

I need someone to hold me close even when I try to push them away and tell me that I can rest now, that I did so much and I did so well, that they see me and appreciate me. I need someone to not care if I don’t look my best today. I want someone to tell me what to order to eat. I don’t want to not get lost but I want someone get lost with me. I want someone to bring me sweet corn while I get my shoe stitched. I want someone to order another cab if there’s no space for me in one. I want someone to have a good time with me and not take me, my feelings for granted. I really want someone to actually, genuinely want me.

I’m just tired of having bad days. I hate the realization of how sad it is that I have to find romance movies and online books to make myself feel loved, or how I’m invited and then uninvited, how I was sitting alone in a room in my very ungroomed condition alone on Diwali, or how I have to write this to make myself realize what I feel is real and actually let it out somehow.

But writing this did make me cry and I’m happy I did it.

73,"I have high functioning anxiety and depression. And severe nerve damage that effects my right side of my body.

I moved an hour and a half away from my friends and family to be with my partner. And it has been the best decision for our relationship and myself. He takes good care of me, and is so supportive of everything. My family has made this easy on me as well and been very supportive. 

I have made a few new friends but I don't have social media platforms except snapchat and hate talking on the phone or text people. People ask to hang out or for my number to hang out and I freak out inside. I want to but I would rather be home with my animals and partner then with other people. My partner isn't a people person, so if we go out we play board games with his 2 best friends which I really enjoy! 

Before I got together with my partner I had 2 best friends that I would hang out with all the time and had a group chat for the 3 of us. 2 of us have social anxiety so we always hang out at 1 or our places. Since the move we barely hang out because when I do go to visit they always have plans. And the one that doesn't have social anxiety always telling to move back home so we can see each other but never makes time for me when I can be there. 

My best friend with social anxiety recently got married and has an 11 yr old step son. We use to only talk about what needed to be done for her wedding, as I was in her wedding party. But now we never talk and feel horrible but understand her family is important. 

My other best friend always sends snapchats of all the things she is doing and screenshots of group chat she, my other best friend and this other girl have which started after our group chat slowly died. Which makes me feel left out, like they did it because of my move. 

I feel horrible because I want to point this all out to them. Along with the fact that when when my best friend who sends me all the snaps moved 10 hrs away we never excluded her and would always make time for her when she would come to visit. And I want to delete them off my snapchat so that I can just stop having all this feels because it makes me angry and depressed all the time. I feel done with them but we have been friends for a long time. 10 yrs with one and 5 yrs with the other.  I just don't know what to do anymore.",28Oct2019,1

79,"Currently going through the process of getting a federal security clearance as I have a job now working for a DOD contractor. For those who aren’t familiar with the process, they essentially look at every part of your life with a microscope to determine if you are fit to handle classified information. Part of that is asking about mental health (and i totally understand why FYI) and if you have every had to receive treatment and therefore I had to disclose problems I was having in college. 

5 years ago when I was a senior in college, I was having issues with depression but never addressed them. I also was having chronic health issues that were debilitating at the same time. It came out when I had a fight with my then boyfriend and became inconsolably upset. I took some ambien my mom gave me to help me sleep but I went back and took more because it didn’t work. She got freaked out and took me to the hospital. They thought I was trying to commit suicide but that wasn’t the case. I was deeply depressed but didn’t feel that way totally. I went through everything at the hospital and then outpatient psychiatric for a year. It was determined i had major depression and anxiety because of the amount of pressure i put on myself. I felt better after some Prozac and eventually graduated, got my first job and carried on post grad successfully.

So here I am almost 27 and got an amazing job for a DOD because of all my hard work post grad. I previously held a high profile executive director role at a major company before this one. Let’s just say I am a totally different, more mature person at this point. With the job I need to have a clearance so I filled out the application and was forced to disclose this event because I was taken to the hospital. This led to me being heavily questioned by an investigator and now I just had to sign releases for all of my medical records at the hospital and at the outpatient care facility to be reviewed. They keep coming back with more questions and more forms for to sign to get more information from my record. I had no clue any of this would have to come up when i started. My temporary was denied. 

The amount of pressure and anxiety i feel right now because of the investigation is intense. Because my records note i took ambien, that can be determined misuse of prescription drugs. If I get denied I will lose my job and be disqualified for a lot of jobs in my area for life. I feel like all my hard work will be for nothing because of what happened when I was 21. I feel like the biggest loser in the world and am extremely embarrassed and it will be over the top of i get denied. I feel like I need to be treated again for anxiety but I am afraid to seek care again as it could come up that the problem isn’t “migitated”. Everyone at work keeps asking me when I’m going to be cleared and I just go back to my office and cry. It’s unearthing old problems that I’ve gotten past for so long. It’s out of my control and now I just wait god knows how long. I feel like my suitability as a person is riding on this strangers determination of me. It feels so cruel. If I had known it would be like this I may not have even gone down this path....",28Oct2019,1
80," Nor am I asking anyone to diagnose me here. Let me jump to the motivation behind this post. Of course, at the moment while I'm typing this post, I feel like shit. Rather I should say I have always been feeling like shit for the past many months. At times I have had anxiety attacks as well as an onset of a mild fever (maybe I should say weakness) that lasted for 10-15 min (weird right?). And this used to happen either randomly or if I have come across a trigger. What I mean by a trigger is either a conversation with a friend that didn't go well or remembering something that must've upset me or a relatable post on the internet that spells a bitter dark truth about life that pushes me into a gloomy state. At the same time, whenever there is something positive going on in my life, I always try to ruin my happy mood by explicitly finding a trigger to make me sad again (oh and I always succeed in doing this). To put this in a simple way, I always find reasons to feel sad because I have somewhat weirdly convinced myself that whatever happiness that exists in my life is only temporary and sooner or later the sadness will kick in, so not worth enjoying it. Boom! Goodbye, to that little ray of sunshine that lasted for a few minutes! So you see the pattern here right? It's almost as if my brain in 'The Awkward Yeti' comics plays the role of the heart, while the heart is just a slave to my brain following every order.

Okay, coming back to the title of this post...hmmmm....what was it again? Oh right! 'I really don't know if I'm depressed'. So why I say this? Because so far I have always thought depression is way worse than what I am going through and even the slightest mention about me suffering from depression makes me brush it aside as a mere over-exaggeration. Whatever I feel, that is, sad, gloomy, shitty, etc is just minor compared to real depression. I actually believe this. Most of my friends to whom I have talked to always tried to push me to a therapist. As usual, I either tried to deviate from the topic thinking it was a mistake to bring it up (me ranting basically) or falsely agree to consult one (and not go) just to shut them up. Now you may wonder why I don't like to visit a therapist. Because I don't fucking trust them at all. Not a single one of them! Zero! Zip! None! Nada! Believe me, I did consider visiting one because I have experienced a severe anxiety attack that made me feel breathless and suffocate by it. Yes, this was a self-triggered attack that exploded on my face unexpectedly. The pain and anger had my head spinning to a point where I felt, ""It's fucking time! This is your sign! You must hit the shrink as soon as possible because this is the start of things to come! Heal your self before its too late!"". The worst part is that this happened later at midnight where I could not call my friends as they were either asleep or at a party or whatever I've still got no fucking clue what they were doing. Plus a closed room made me feel like I was falling into the void in Minecraft, darkness surrounding me as my mind succeeded in breaking that stubborn bedrock, mind blank, pitch-black surroundings even though the room was bright (slightly an exaggerated detail).

Coming back to why I don't trust them. Often at times, I heard stories of some of my acquaintances who visited shrinks, and in most of the cases, it was pointless and a waste of time. I was told that it was masked to be helpful at first but the end product was piss poor and the cure didn't last very long. Therapy in my city is overpriced and expensive (I have seen the rates while I was hunting for one and fuck me, man, this is indeed a scam!). Most shrinks also prolonged their sessions to milk more cash from the patient and I felt utterly disgusted hearing this. It's not that I cannot afford therapy, I am just not entirely convinced if it's worth overpaying for what its worth. And no this isn't a dig at all shrinks so don't misquote me on that. I am just narrating my story here. I generally don't trust doctors so this also plays a role in my distrust in therapy. First and foremost, I never thought I needed therapy because I am still not convinced whether I am depressed or not. I am told by people that I am, but I fail to understand the severity. Before my anxiety attack, I used to think that I can handle this by keeping myself distracted, such as watching my favorite sports, watching movies, playing video games, working out, etc (and it did work so who the fuck needs therapy lol?). Even today my day to day hobbies and work keep me distracted from pain and sadness. The only time gloom kicks in is during night hours when I stay up late and alone in my bedroom working or browsing the internet. That's when I start to feel lonely and scared (even though I am not since I have close friends living abroad bonded for life). possibly start overthinking upcoming attacks on me or overanalyze a trivial moment and draw pointless conclusions and dramatic inferences from it.

I won't lie, I have had anxiety attacks before the recent one, but those were kinda moderate and temporary, lasting for a few minutes. Now that I think about it, I am confused as to whether I should call them anxiety attacks (or not? You tell me by looking at the symptoms I have mentioned). I should mention that my recent attack didn't allow me to sleep, and knowing that sleep out of the picture, I decided to hit the gym at 4 AM. It was a bad idea. I felt nauseous and the after-effects of the nightmare (I am aware that I am making this sound like a fictional horror story but this is exactly how I felt during that incident) but it slowly faded away once was distracted by the workout. So this was months ago. As time went by, I started to feel better, gone through minor episodes of anxiety(?), started to feel therapy isn't needed anymore (I have spent all this while deciding on that) and could stick to my own ways of healing myself. Worked like a charm!

But today was the day where I lost the delusion of me being fine, cured or normal. Just one of those dark days in life where I observe everyone on social media having a jolly weekend with exciting plans and entertaining events and I look at myself, miserably bored with no plans and a busy schedule trying to come out of the dark corner I have kept myself for a long time. At the moment, yes, I am lonely, yes, in the same city I grew up in (would've been satisfying if I was an immigrant since I can give myself an excuse for the state I am in). I feel like I should blame myself for the loneliness because I am naturally reserved, introverted, disinterested in socializing all because of the fact that I believe this entire society is a big fucking hoax. I am convinced that everyone around me is counterfeit, a poor imitation of modesty masking their supercilious characteristics. I am very skeptical about the existence of altruistic humans (not like I expect anything from anyone). Because who isn't self-centered these days? At times I feel paranoid about being used as a prop to-be-disposed-away by people I am associated with. To sum it up, I cannot trust people, I cannot put my faith in anything positive emerging from it. At times I also feel like the ones whom I trust the most will soon Red Wedding the fuck out of me given a chance (Ugh! I know this is crazy but I can't help it!). I have given up trying to fight fear and the self reserved nature and instead kept myself in that dark corner pretending to be in solitude while knowing very clearly that it's pulling me down deep into the pit.

I don't stay still and accept shit like a doormat. I try everything to fight the issues I am facing. I fight anxiety by forcing a distraction, I fight loneliness by calling up my pals, I fight 'introvertism' by constantly engaging in social activities such as board game conventions (Oh I love board games), I fight distrust by....um...yep, I have no solution to that one! Sometimes I don't always win these fights because the strength of those negative aspects overwhelms my will to fight it. Every time I try to come out of that dark corner, I get pulled back in. And hence it finally gets to me making me feel shitty, miserable and awful throughout the day. And at this point, I feel like my friends have given up on me and left it to me to handle shit on my own. I really don't want to sound like I'm asking for help from anyone, I am just looking for answers to clear out my confusion as to what constitutes anxiety, what constitutes depression? Am I socially fucked in life? I am a 22-year-old student doing fairly decent in my career, applying for Universities for MS. Highly motivated to achieve greater goals, not letting my personal problems get in the way of that. I have a good family, I was given everything I needed in life, couldn't ask for more. I am surrounded by good people who are ready to be there for me when I need them. I'm not suicidal, never was and never will be. I don't self-harm. I am fairly decent looking so that rules out low self-esteem. Why I have mentioned these is because I am not burdened with major responsibilities or unfavorable fate, unlike many others I know. Hence these leads to questions such as:

* Am I really depressed or am I acting like a whiny toddler making myself a victim out of everything? (frankly, this is what I currently think about myself)
* Am I using 'anxiety attack' correctly or is there another colloquially accepted condition for it?
* How do I easily trust people? Because this is the hardest challenge in my life.
* Should I really consult a therapist or should I carry on with my ways of handling my problems as usual?
* Should I quit social media? My Instagram feed is fucked up with depressing posts.",28Oct2019,1
81,"I know this is long but bare with me please:

So I am a 26 year old who has never committed to a full time job. I graduated college with the highest honors but I've had a problem committing to full time job. I've always tried to avoid full time work as it feels like its not worth it. I feel like I am having a commitment issue at this point in my life. I've been wanting to have my own business but I jump around so many ideas to the point that I never commit to one idea, so nothing actually came to fruition. I did an internship in my field the summer before the last one and although I didn't like the work, I liked the people and felt that they also liked me. My boss offered me his position and I declined.

This past summer, I applied to a job. I wasn't sure if I would like it. I was excited when I got the call to make an appointment to interview. During the interview, I did fine but I feel like I could have done much better. I was somewhat not trying my best on purpose. Right before leaving the interview, the manager told me the usual: we have to interview someone else tomorrow and we will let you know. I almost knew that I wasn't going to get an offer based on body language and what not and this made me feel good actually. Most people would feel bad if they thought they wouldn't get an offer but I actually felt good. I felt free knowing this.

I've been working these ""Temporary"" jobs in the same hospital that gave me internships since I was in high school. I have had two ""temporary"" jobs. I say ""temporary"" because they aren't really temporary in the direct definition of the word. They are jobs that many people use to get their foot in the hospital, you can leave after 3 months work but you don't have to stay long. They were two jobs. The first was watching patients who are suicidal or have some abnormal psych problem. The second is basically customer service for the docs and nurses. Both jobs are the type of jobs that might be chill one minute and bat shit cray the next. These 2 jobs that I had in the hospital since graduating university are the type of jobs that really lead no where but the thing was that I was able to choose the shift and the days that I could work. I worked mostly part time as they were stressful.

Now again I have the opportunity to work fulltime in my brothers lab in the same hospital. He really wants me to work with them. He is a research engineer and I would start as a research tech. I am not sure if I would be able to work this job. I feel that I interned in almost everything in this hospital except the research/laboratories. He told me about a possible opening about a month ago and when it opened a couple days ago. I felt like crap when he told me that it opened. I want to pursue but at the same time, it feels like a heavy load. It almost feels as though I'm giving up on my entrepreneurial dreams. If I don't join I'm going to be staying at this job that allows me to choose my schedule and leave for as long as I want to (I left for three months to travel before).

The other piece is that my brother and I can get at each others throat sometimes. I'm afraid that this might cause a problem at work sometimes, although he seems happier when I see him at work then when I see him at home so not sure how this would play out. I've considered not taking this job and going to a different country to teach English, but I also feel like I might get disappointed later on and ask myself the what if later on as these lab positions don't come every day but teaching English will be there for a long time.

At this point, I want to take the job and if I don't like it then just suck it up and stick it out for a total of 6-7 months and then leave. My brother told me that he might leave in the next 8-12 months as he has been there for over 2 years and learned most of the stuff. What should I do?????",28Oct2019,1
82,"In a month or so, a good friend of mine is moving out of town for an internship abroad. Even if I'm proud of him, the thought of him leaving also scares me a lot since during the last couple of years, he has become one of the most trusted people in my life - one of those with whom I could always be myself, to whom I could consider talking about anything, and who has always listened to me even when no one else did. Needless to say, it actually feels as if a part of me was taken / ripped away - especially when I don't really have any other (really) good friends here.

Despite having emotionally prepared myself for his departure for some time now already, I really don't know what to do once he's actually out of town - messaging etc. isn't really the same as talking face to face or hanging out ""for real""... Merely thinking about the situation at hand is enough to cause me enormous anxiety.",28Oct2019,1

I am strugling a lot with my mental health, to the point I just fought out of a depression thanks to my dysthymic disorder and have a tenative transexual diagnosis (that is one major reason for my mental health problems) and atm my pshycologist wants to help me work on social anxiety, but I feel like it does not help, I feel like nothing helps, body love and self apriciation is nowhere to be found, happiness is generally lacking most of the times, am on a high right now thought, and I often go days without taking care for myself, perhaps weeks at a time.

87,"Hello, I’m sorry for making this rant so long, but I’m lost in this and I don’t know how to formulate it better. I have been dealing with a lot lately and Im loosing hope that my life will ever be enjoyable again.


A year ago I had a lung infection and during that time my life changed for the worse and has never been the same, even though no doctor that I have seen has been able to tell me what happened to me or help me. All blood tests were negative so far. The only doctor I should probably see again now I think that I got some kind of a nerve hyperexcitability disorder (probably benign fasciculation syndrome or cramp fasciculation syndrome) and it completely paralyzed my life.

I experience intense twitching in all of my body, muscle jerking, painful cramps in my hands and feet, constant fatigue, tremor and other. Things that wouldn’t make me anxious in the past now make my whole body vibrate and shake like crazy. The problem is that Im often not even sure if its anxiety, because I dont understand what am I anxious about. Like I feel almost no mental anxiety, no worrying or intrusive thoughts, nothing. But my body feels like I can’t control it fully, like it’s all stuck in one big cramp. 

I’m already going to theraphy and I like my therapist, but I don’t think it can help me, because I feel like there is no root in this problem, its all random. The way I understand it is that therapy should change the way I think about stuff, but I feel like that is not going to help with this problem, because my mind is already not worrying about things that much.  It feels like my body physically overreacts to normal things. 

It’s super frustrating to me and slowly makes me more and more depressed. Ive been thinking about death a lot lately, but I really don’t want to die, I want my life back, but at the same time death feels like a better alternative than just living “paralyzed” like this. Deep breathing doesn’t help in the slightest. So far nothing helps really. 

Other problem that I have is that now I have zero energy to do anything. It’s probably a combination of constant fatigue, the depression (that stems from this). I have problems with doing what I have to do everyday and even things I enjoy I can’t do as much now. I mostly just kill time doing nothing. I can’t fix any stuff in my life now, because I just don’t have the energy. I know it sounds like I’m a lazy fuck, but I really suffer from this. I’m slowly isolating myself because I’m unable to keep up with my friends. I also can’t focus on anything now.

I sometimes self medicate with alcohol, but I’m trying not to do it too often. But it is the only thing I can rely on really, when it all becomes unbearable. Nothing. Else. Helps. :( 

I’m thinking about trying antidepressants, but I don’t know. My psychiatrist doesn’t seem to be a big proponent of medication and thinks that therapy is better, but as I said I don’t know if therapy can really help with this. I feel like it can’t. I also want to try beta-blockers or some similar medication, but it seems like they are not used in psychiatry in my country. So mby only neurologist can prescribe them to me, but I’m afraid that they will not want to help me, because my symptoms are benign or that they will tell me that it’s anxiety caused and that I should just go to therapy. Propranolol is not even predcribed in my country, but I guess there should be some similar medication. I thought about ordering it illegally from the internet, but I’m afraid of self medicating like that. 

I really think that Im fucked for life right now. I don’t understand what’s going on and no one seems to get me. I’ve had hope that it was going to get better, but I slowly lost it. My life is just surviving rn. I’m totally lost and fed up with this. I don’t want to die but I’m really really afraid that it’s the only way out.",28Oct2019,2

90,"I assume this is pretty common. Besides it being natural for short while. It's getting on more often and often. To the point  it happens 6 days of the week, and one day free. Unlike the opposite.

This has been going on for a long while, too much for me to like to admit. It reached a point where it heavily affected my functional life. Visited a number of doctors. They all seem to agree its depression. I'll avoid the lifestyle changes since they're well known and I resonated with more than half of them.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward now, and I've been trying to keep my diet nutrient. Going out everyday, make activities. Problem is, the fogged memory and illogical thinking keeps coming back. And that doesn't go away despite keeping up a schedule. I sleep average 12 hours a day, which takes all morning, the best time to be productive. Also university started two months ago and I still didn't attend(I study abroad) and keeping home in order to treat myself. The past semester was a nightmare due to this and pretty much ended doing nothing. It wasn't just lacking the will. It was inability to learn, memorise, or remember anything. What gets to me is being very irrational in thought. Which makes everything a dozen fold harder, from simple tasks that aren't part of autopilot routine to social interactions and education. So I've thought if I take this year off and cure myself I can get back and save money on the year instead of racking up more subject I'll never finish that way.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway please excuse the terrible formatting and order. It's very difficult to construct something in this mindset. I've done medical checkups and everything is fine besides the vitamin D level, which is at severe deficiency. But vitamin D topic is very controversial upon doctors.

My identical twin brother and I have both suffered with OCD since we were 5 years old (we’re now 25).

We didn’t start getting professional medical help until our early twenties. We know first-hand how it is for OCD to go untreated (or even wrongly treated). Because of this (and the misconceptions regarding the symptoms of OCD) we have decided to create a (hopefully entertaining) video on how to know if you have OCD. We’ve also provided a framework of how to start getting treatment if you haven’t already.

93,"My wife suffers from a plethora of Mental illnesses (severe OCD, D.I.D, depression, anxiety PTSD) and I have worked in mental health most my professional life.

She is really talented drawing simple cartoons and in the span of a month has 200 followers for her comic in Japan (she is Japanese) simply from posting cartoons of her experiences dealing with some of her mental health issues.

I'm thinking this medium may be a good idea for educational books on mental health.  Instead of reading a book about depression/OCD etc having a comic strip that follows the journey.  I think a comic could show more of the emotion, give a greater understanding of how it feels to deal with these illnesses. 

The goal would be a book that shows those with mental illnesses that people understand what they are going through all while also teaching what is going on in the brain and maybe even address some possible treatments.  

But also, I think such a book would be good for family members to get a better understanding of what is going on, to show that depression isn't about sadness, or how crippling OCD can be and that it isn't as simple as just push through it etc.

Talking to a therapist won’t help either because therapists tend to use the same conversation topics over and over again. I breathe, eat, shower, go to school, work. I’m 21, I’m young, and I’m not passionate about anything. I’m curious by nature but jumping from interest to interest won’t lead to stability. I don’t have feelings for anyone either. I absolutely do not care for anyone or their problems. I’m too busy with my negative thoughts and emotions to be empathetic toward others. I’ve grown too comfortable where I’m at right now in life because I’m not necessarily failing at anything but I feel safe. I’m too scared to change. I feel stuck in comfort and that’s why I’m in a rut. My comfort zone isn’t ideal either. I’m scared to change jobs, I’m scared to move away from my parents (plus it’s expensive), I’m scared to socialize with new people, I’m scared to open up with my friends because they seem not to care just like me, and I’m scared of my dark thoughts. Like I’ve said, I’m not passionate or interested in anything or anyone in particular and this has led to dark, twisted thoughts like suicide. I’m too much of a coward to do it however. I wish my life was so different. Sometimes all I want to do is move out of the country and change my identity. I know that to change my life, I have to push myself. I just don’t believe in myself. I’ve pushed myself before only to fall back into depression. Life sucks and growing up sucks. I hate all of it. I want to die but can’t. I am not myself, never really been myself, and I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m just stuck in the present moment, breathing. It sounds a bit positive to say that but it’s not helping me at all. I lack ambition/determination because I haven’t invested in myself. Like I’ve said, I feel safe in the present moment doing nothing but breathing.

101," 

Hi guys,

First I want to say I know my issues are internally and I need therapy - I've been trying but on waitlist for numerous people. But just curious if anyone has done anything at home other than looking in the mirror and reciting mantras that can help me.

I took my boyfriend to my friends party with me and there was this gorgeous girl there. She walked in and definitely kept making eyes at him and he noticed. I could just tell his demeanor changed and that he was not happy he was there with me anymore.

About a week later we broke up. I can't help but keep thinking of this girl and that maybe he was into her and realized he didn't love me. I'm like obsessed with seeing if he's going to follow her on social media. I've also done this in the past with girls he met out at the bar when he started following them. I just keep looking at their posts and seeing what he's been liking and cannot stop myself. It's just like I become obsessed with him possibly being into other people or thinking they're prettier than me (grow up I know, I know) and it hurts so much knowing I don't look like them. I never brought the girl from the party up, but I know my insecurities ultimately led to our break-up but I have no idea how to stop these thoughts of him going out and getting over me so quickly. It's killing me. I hate that I compare myself to other people because deep down I know what I have to offer and that I should be confident because I know a lot of people look up to me as well.

Since I'm friends with this hot girls friend lol we most likely will be going out together this weekend. I don't want to feel intimidated or insecure anymore. I want to be so happy in my own skin that I wouldn't give a damn if anyone looked at my guy. A lot of this stems from childhood issues of my fathers infidelity and I know I deserve better because my ex didn't always make me feel secure. I just don't know if it was all me or all him or just a toxic emotional relationship. Any specific podcasts, books, youtube videos/meditations that have helped **extremely** self-conscious females out there?

Thanks!",28Oct2019,2

105,"Hello there, 

  I have been experiencing some dreams that have had my Ex in it. ""So dramatic i know!"" Allow me to elaborate a little more, I was in middle school, had the whole depression and forever alone package. There was this girl I met one day and I guess you can say she let me see a new light. I liked this girl but it wasn't till many months later, we were building a foundation and I really felt love. 

  But, towards the end of a summer, she wanted to break up due to ""Being unable to balance a relationship and school."" Which is understandable in some parts, but, like ""what the hell, why did I waste my time on this relationship for!!!!"" And then later on down the road I get dreams of her. Then heartbreak. Then more dreams. I'm in high school now and haven't dated this girl since like 7th grade and I'm over her at this point.

109,"17m, only things I've been officially diagnosed with are Bipolar 2 and a panic disorder. I have a therapist but don't trust him enough to actually talk about myself. He's cool though.

I don't really know where to begin, there's a lot of really weird things happening to me and I need to vent about it. For one, I believe my Bipolar 2 might be progressing into Bipolar 1 if that's possible? The episodes get worse each time. Before I was just hyper, talkative, and unable to sleep. Now if a manic episode hits I don't sleep for days, I get wracking anxiety and extreme dissociation, I get incredibly mean and start destroying my relationships, and occasionally I'll have what I think are auditory hallucinations. I do not receive medication for it because I refuse to take pills. I'm practically incapable of it for a reason I'll get to.

Then when I'm not having an episode it's the nightmares. It's every other night practically, and the nights I don't have them it's because I didn't sleep. They're stupid dumb nightmares. They always have feelings of abandonment or loss or whatever. I can't really remember what happens in them, just the really shitty feelings that come with them. I had a pretty bad childhood and dealt with a lot of those feelings growing up.

I've also attempted suicide and self harmed numerous times. I think I was around 7-8 with my earliest attempt. Anyways, I bring it up not because I'm suicidal, but because my most recent attempt back in April really messed me up. My parents had caught me abusing drugs and I felt like such a disappointment. They didn't know what lead me to abusing them. That night I took a massive amount of my antidepressants hoping to die. I slowly fell asleep as the drugs took hold to my music. I've never felt so powerless. Well I woke up in the morning, shivering and shaking all day from the drugs. Nobody even noticed or at least cared that I was like that.

Well come back to today and I'm almost unable to take pills without vomiting. I had a depressive episode back in August where I took some of the pills I had left to kill my emotions and just... vomited everywhere. I tossed them out after that and vowed to never take drugs again, that I would stay alive for the girl I loved. I can't take ibuprofen, struggle to take Tums even, and I have no idea how I will ever be able to take mood stabilizers. Sometimes I get flashbacks to this attempt as a nightmare, sometimes I'm pretty sure I hallucinate. I once heard one of the songs I fell asleep dying to come from literally nowhere. It gave me some pretty bad flashbacks and a panic attack. Almost certain I hallucinated it.

And yeah that's basically it but some other kinda important stuff I should say: 

In moments of severe stress I straight up can lose most contact with reality. I've had some weird hallucinations before when this happens. 

I don't think I'm schizophrenic, but definitely highly neurotic. These ""hallucinations"" only happen in severe emotional states. 

The trauma from my childhood manifests itself differently from the trauma from that one suicide attempt. Whereas I can pinpoint flashbacks from the attempt and the feelings it gives me, the flashbacks from my childhood are very subtle and confusing. I feel like my childhood trauma manifests itself in every way of my life, where the suicide attempt trauma is generally restricted to obvious flashbacks. 

I've never had a good romantic relationship. The one I had before my current one was incredibly toxic and we simply were never meant. My current one is with a 19 year old and my friends say she's abusive. She might be. I've always been drawn to broken people who hurt me and only ever notice the red flags too late. 

I've only seen a psychiatrist once. She really sucked. Said I was bipolar but blamed my trauma/occasional hallucinations on lack of sleep. It is incredibly hard to find one where I live. Everybody is booked or doesn't take our insurance. I feel like I'm just going to slip between the cracks and spiral into insanity and neurosis if I don't get help soon, but nobody will HELP.",28Oct2019,3

I'm just frustrated after graduating university to then be in a shit customer service office job. To be alone at 30. Im bitter and resentful and I want things to go my way for a change.

Then I read online that a relationship wont solve my problems which i know is true, but i still want one. I just want to heal myself, feel like I'm enough the way i am instead of comparing my shit life to everyone else who is better looking, more socially and confident 

I feel like a loser even after everything i have accomplished over the last 4 years and its tiring.",28Oct2019,5
111,"False Memory OCD

Video Link: [https://youtu.be/zioi\_7c3XeY](https://youtu.be/zioi_7c3XeY)

is not a well known subtype of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In fact it affects a lot of people around the world and causes them significant problems and anxiety. It is called “false memory OCD”, as there would be no actual evidence that something has happened. Those who suffer from this condition tell stories that they have done something very wrong, such as murder or rape, but there is a complete lack of evidence that they had committed such an act. Also, they would be hesitant to let these memories go, believing that, despite the lack of evidence, there is a chance that they did something bad, even feeling guilty about it and demanding to know the absolute truth.",28Oct2019,1

115,"Long story short. I was in abusive relationship and then quickly got into another one that ended badly to now I see a therapist. I haven't fully told him about what I am doing, but the way he he tells me that I am doing fine.


So I use Tinder to make FWB. I have 2 so far, but I'm never satisfied, I look for more or I need more from them to make me feel ""happy"" I should say.

I constantly go on this binge of finding someone to either replace or add. At first it was fun, I had one guy who knew and didn't want anything committed then it changed. Somedays I feel okay and better and have this self confidence about myself. Then some day's (like today) I feel empty and needing more.

It's like the bad days I want something more, a relationship to feel whole, but I find ways of thinking I don't that I don't deserve it or I'm just not emotionally ready for a relationship and I just can't do it.

The good day I think I don't need these people as a relationship and I feel happy right now so I don't need anything more.

I get confused and sad about it more then before, but I feel like I can't stop? I tell myself constantly I'll delete the app, but I think about getting another one or re downloading it.

120,"It took a shit ton of work to live through my couple of years of severe depression. I am now 18 years old, and I feel like my life's coming together for the first time in my young adult / teen life.

I always thought that the ""things will get better."" conversations were complete bullshit. I don't see it quite as severely, but it still runs true to an extent. That. Is. Bullshit. Now, I can see it in less of a black and white fashion. Things don't *get* better. Rather, you work on keeping your head above water and making small steps towards contentment. It's hard, hard, hard work.

There's so much to be discovered in this world. I'm glad that I didn't commit suicide, I'm glad that I built up the strength to stay in this world, because there's so much beauty that depression can make you fail to perceive. 

I'm experiencing love for the first time, getting to know a girl that I have feelings for. I've learned to recognize the positive parts of my days, and not focus solely on the negative.

I swear. I'd understand it if anybody reading this didn't understand what I'm getting at, hopelessness can do that to you. Don't dismiss your thoughts, feelings, and mood. That can be unhealthy. Try to work towards bettering them. 

Please. Just remember. Things can get better. You can make things better. I've fallen as far as it gets into anxiety, depression, and hopelessness. It's a matter of networking yourself with therapy, medications, and self care. With the self care, start by doing the absolute minimum. Can't shower? Wash/rinse your face, stand under the water for a few minutes. Can't brush your teeth? Mouthwash, rinse your mouth out with water. Anything that brings you less intimidation is a win. 

You owe it to yourself to keep at it, keep trying. I'm not necessarily out of the deep end, myself. But I'm getting there. If you have any questions, have at it.

I'm sorry if this is a bit of a ramble. I'm just trying to get as much down as I can. Love y'all.

122,"My wife recently started treatment for paranoid ideation as part of what is at least a severe anxiety disorder with delusional thoughts (including auditory hallucinations) going back years.  I am more inclined to think BPD or some other sort of coexisting delusional disorder as there are also frequent angry (sometimes violent) outbursts when her alternate realities or control issues are challenged.  We have kids, and I had to balance finally taking a stand against letting the younger kids get old enough for a judge to presume they needed mom most and her behavior finally getting too bad to allow to continue. She had frequently threatened to leave rather than change, and indicated she was going to fight dirty to get the younger kids if I tried to make her get help or even raised those issues with our pastor.

Her first counseling session was Oct 7, and her therapist asked me to come Oct 15th.  At that session, the therapist was surprised she could function at work as the only reason she was not suggesting voluntarily hospitalization, and wanted my wife to see a P-doc.  Wife was adamantly opposed, but had already scheduled a second appointment with our family doc for the next day after she had not mentioned any of her more disturbing beliefs with him in an appointment she had made 2 weeks prior.  She came home (on the 16th) with a script of Seroquel, which she said was supposed to be only once a day and for her to go back in 60 days.  I thought that was way too long, but it fit the symptoms I was seeing and did not press my luck.  Around the 22nd she apparently got rational enough to look up what that was used to treat and told me she wanted to switch to just a more specific (and basic) anti-anxiety medication, even though she was still insisting on pressing me a couple times a day to admit various imagined overheard conversations (about variois women chasing me or me cheating on her) were plausible.  


This weekend was worse than most of the time starting a day after she started meds, and she also admitted she had skipped a dose as part of telling me she wanted to switch.  Yesterday, she told me she had called our doctor and specifically asked to be switched to an SSRI.  She was also adamant that I should not be talking to her treatment team without her permission.

On a whim today I went home at lunch and finally looked at the bottle and counted pills.  Was 25mg on label for taking twice a day, but she had only taken 9 over 12 nights, so she has skilled 1/4 of the nights, and more doses than that if she was supposed to have transitioned to taking it twice a day after the first few days.  

Should I contact our family doctor or her therapist about this?  Suggestions on doing that?

I am afraid of being alone for too long. My roommate and friends were out of town a few weeks ago, and I didn’t leave my room, or eat for three days, had a psychotic meltdown and ended up cutting myself. Just once, and it wasn’t bad. It healed in a few days but I haven’t done that since high school. Now I can’t stop thinking about it. The exacto knives in my art classrooms are almost tantalizing. 

I have talked to my parents about wanting to try antidepressants but to no avail. My mom is on anxiety and depression meds herself, so I don’t know why they don’t take me seriously. 

So if anyone knows of any resources of where I get access to cheap psychiatry, and maybe get help without the aid of insurance (since I don’t have my parent’s support). I am literally on my last leg here.

127,"I have hit a wall. I am completely helpless. I am a student in Mechanical Engineering and there is this class that has brought me to my knees. Really though, this class is just the straw that broken the camels back. For a long time I have suspected that I suffer from some mental instability but it has never manifested itself fully. A while ago I had, effectively, an entire shutdown of my Gastrointestinal system because of Anxiety and Stress. I had covered up the way that I coped with stress to the point that my body used different methods to get me to stop doing what I was doing. It ended really badly. I failed that semester, and had to go into surgery to get my gallbladder removed because it had actually died from lack of electrical stimulus.

The medical industry and mental health is a fucking joke. I had them try to ""get me in"", next open appointment was July of 2020. Oh, but don't worry, ""these drugs will help until then"". Fuck you. I'm not gonna let you guys prescribe me some mind altering drug which costs a stupid amount just so that I can have an appointment with a person so that they can suggest a new drug, all the while I'm sure their making some sort of profit off what ever they suggest. 

I have been stuck going through the medical bureaucracy for 3 years trying to find out what is wrong with me. And they have done jack, except of course, accept about $11,000 and that's with some pretty damn good insurance. The University of Utah Hospital is a fucking joke. I know there are people who can help right now, but it seems like the only way to get access to them right away is if you hurt yourself or attempt suicide or pay a ridiculous amount of money. Besides that its a fucking enormous wait list. 

I guess i'll just wait for July 29th when I scheduled my appointment, all the while trying not to break down, trying to pass my classes, trying to make my parents happy, trying to do my job effectively so that I can pay for rent, and then the future medical expenses.

I was having a conversation with one of my good friends about his struggles and his story about his bipolar disorder. We then dove in deeper into the topic and began to discuss other types of mental illness ( which I wasn’t too informed about ). He begins to tell me the symptoms of depression, and I’m pretty much mentally checking off everything he lists.

Later on that night I begin look deeper into what depression actually and finally conclude that I might potential have depression

The thing is though, I have a genuinely great life. I play sports, have a 4.0, a decent amount of friends and good home life, and I feel happy and content with who I am, but I occasionally ( maybe once or twice a week ), I get this deep, dark feeling of nothingness.

I've spent the last months mostly inside my bedroom, because I have no energy. I have put my academic life on hold bc of this. Feeling like a huge loser.

I have an appointment with a psychotherapist in 2 weeks but I have no hope because some have failed me in the past. 

At this point I just don't believe I'll ever get better. I feel like I'm stuck in a cycle - I can't sleep at night, then I sleep all day, get nothing done - and I'll never get out of it. 

It's so scary. I'm feeling hopeless. 

Have you ever felt like that? 
Please help me. Thank you so much.",28Oct2019,1
142,"I have these two friends and we basically each live in our own corner of the country so we don't see each other a lot. One of them basically came out in the groupchat and then admitted to cutting herself. I don't really have any more context apart from the fact that her mum didn't take her outing very well. Not catastrophically so though, to me it seems like she's in denial.

I really don't know what to do. This has all happened in just a few whatsapp messages over the past couple days. I know I don't have anything close to the whole picture here and I don't know if I should ask. I don't want to make it worse by being nosy. I'm not even sure how to ask or what to say anyway.

144,"I first started experiencing mental health problems when I was 11, I had an eating disorder. I started self harming at 12. At 14 my school attendance plummeted and at 15 after experiencing sexual abuse I dropped out completely. 

I developed a drug habit as a coping mechanism that gave me psychosis.

At 16, I was forced into education again as it’s law here until you’re 18. I had no GCSES so I could only study at a low level, I managed to pass the course I was on just barely as I was in hospital most of the year because I kept harming myself

I did nothing at 17 except whore myself out online to men despite being a lesbian. 

At 18 I went back and re sat all the exams I missed as a teen and managed to find a very good therapist.
Now 19, I’m doing an access course for university and it’s going well. I’ll definitely be at uni next year if I don’t kill myself. I am the most stable I’ve ever been but I’m not exactly great.

I’m top in my class and well liked by my classmates but my self hatred is crippling. The mental health services here are dire unless you’ve been hospitalised for a suicide attempt, which I’ve not been for over two years now. Currently I am diagnosed with ASD, PTSD depression and anxiety. I know however that I have a bipolar disorder and I’ve been waiting many a month for a psych evaluation to get that on paper and get the correct meds 

I’m trying, really hard to be healthy and successful. On the outside I’m doing incredibly well and people comment on it a lot. No matter what though it seems futile. I can be good for a while but when those depressive episodes hit the urges I get are intense. When I’m manic, I ruin my own life too.

I want to get a PHD one day and I’m certain I’ll manage if I get my brain sorted but it just seems so futile. I feel like I’ll never be happy or healthy and I’ll always have this addiction to self destruction. It’s so hard to stay out of the hospital, it’s disgustingly hard to just be a person. 

I know logically that I have so much going for me, smart an attractive etc etc. Even so I can’t stop being mental and I hate it, I hate me with a passion and while I want to succeed and do great things. The futility of it all really makes me suicidal. I am worried that I won’t get to uni because I will kill myself first. I have a very graphic mental image of me cutting myself very deeply and then laying down on a train track to get crushed as a train comes. 

Worst of all, I don’t think if I do get better I’ll deserve it. For I am not a good person.

148,"I am 19F and I have just come out of a 3 year relationship which caused a lot of strain on my mental health- I developed OCD and Anxiety, specifically intrusive thoughts. My intrusive thoughts got so bad that I felt that even if I looked at someone else in a completely innocent way then I was cheating on my now ex-boyfriend. Because of this, I ate a lot. I ate to make myself the most unattractive version I could be of myself.

Before my relationship I was 147lbs, toned, active and all round good shape. Now, I am 308lbs. 

Even though the intrusive thoughts have eased a bit and I am no longer in the toxic relationship- I still can't stop eating. I could easily consume 4000+ calories a day without even thinking about it.

149,"I attempted suicide two days ago and I'm not sure why. I was fairly normal before and I'm starting to feel normal again after.
Why? What's wrong with me? Am I so low that I can even realize?


For some context, here is a recollection of what happened last Saturday.

The before
My birthday was on Friday. My emotions were fairly stable and normal up until my birthday, I was meditating daily, exercising twice a week and hanging out with friends. All things that were supposed to help me feel good. However, with the upcoming of my birthday o started to feel a little anxious. With everyone caring about me and showing me love felt strange and I don't like to be the center of attention I guess. 
Anyway, on Saturday, a day after my birthday, I was home alone tweaking stuff on my computer. For some reason something was not working and I was starting to feel frustrated. So I walked around my house thinking what could I do now. I paced for a while. Then I looked at my belt on the table. And I don't know why but the felling to hang myself started to come up. Then a ponder for a minute. I felt really at peace in that moment. Then I checked my plants and remembered that I hadn't watered them in a while since it had been raining. I proceeded to water them. Then I went to grab the last piece of cake from my birthday and ate it. Then I opened my previously written suicide letter, read it again, changed some stuff and left it on the table. Then I grabbed my belt.

The act
First tied the belt around my neck I checked how much more rope I had. Then I removed from my neck and tied a knot on horizontal bar above my head. Than I climbed a little bench, put the belt around my neck and then calmly step down, leaving with my feet on the ground and my  knees slightly bent. 
To my surprise a started losing my senses almost 2 seconds after it and I panic. I was able to untied myself but managed to passed out. I woke on the floor with my breading really accelerated. I removed the belt from my neck, got up really quickly, folded again my suicide letter, put it in my pocket and then trowed myself on to my bed. I was really scared. After a while I started feeling my face in pain. I had hit my head on to a chair leaving a big bruise beneath my eye and some scratch on my cheek. Also, I had some blood coming out of my neck, probably from the belt but I'm not sure.
At that was it.

The after
On Sunday I felt really bad and low. Still trying to grasp what I had been through.
On Monday, a work day, was the same. But now I felt more at ease, like I was starting to return to normal.",28Oct2019,31
150,"I was diagnosed with bpd. I classify for all symptoms except for anger outbursts.
One thing I am struggling with is that I get extremely hyper at times and become highly impulsive which makes me think I have bipolar. But the thing is, these highs do not last for days-weeks-months like you would see in bipolar, alternatively, I experience them probably every other day. When I am not ""high"", I am ectremely low. There is no happy medium.
Do others experience this as well that have a bpd diagnosis?

151,"So, I had an unexpected meltdown at school today. I’m a student teacher, and part of my program is to tutor a student with certain struggles. I was already having an off day but like most days I just shrugged it off and tried to power through. 

Then, about 10 minutes before I’m supposed to tutor, I think okay, maybe I’ll just ask my supervisor if I can leave a little early today because I’m just not in the right mindset at all. Then I immediately burst out into tears. In front of everyone. My supervisor tells me to take it easy, go home, and relax. 

I am so embarrassed. I can’t believe I seriously lost my shit in front of other adults. I can’t stop thinking about what others might be thinking about me. I feel like a fucking child.",28Oct2019,2
152,"Hello all

I constantly feel as if I might explode most of the time. I feel as if the list of things I would like to enjoy has become a 'must do/consume' list. It includes the need to finish watching all episodes of TV shows, all books in a series or universe, all podcasts that interest me in a big playlist, all graphic novels in a series I started or would like to start.....

I have always 10 books from the library that I am always rushing through to get done and returned. 

Some days I feel like just powering through all 'open' threads such as playlists, book series, movies within same universe, etc, in one long period of time so I can get them done and out of the way but I feel as if it will never end.

It feels overwhelming and has sucked all the fun out of them. Does this happen to people? Am I just trying to replace the lack of productivity with an easier thing? How to approach? Ironically, I feel as if there is a book on this... lol",28Oct2019,1
153,I have been dealing with mostly untreated depression my whole life. This past year I went and tried to get help and have gotten no where. I have now come to the conclusion that I just need to accept that the depression is permanent and won't be leaving.

The serenity of accepting this has brought so much more peace.,28Oct2019,3
154,"I did it. I didn't think it was possible for me to disappoint myself at this point. I've mostly just been expecting the worst out of myself. But by God I did it.

 So I took some people's advice and decided I really needed to see my doctor about all my physical and mental health issues. I hadn't seen him in close to five years. I finally broke and made an appointment. That appointment was today.

And you know what I did? I just fucking answered his questions telling him I'm completely fine and then did not bring up any of my concerns. Then he told me I am 100% fine and I left.

Why did I even bother going? What was the point if I'm not going to even talk to him? How pathetic and useless am I that I can't even talk about my health to my doctor?

When I made the appointment I thought ""this is it, it's time to actually do something"" and I was mildly proud of myself for once. For the past few weeks I've been thinking about everything I wanted to bring up and how to do and about what was likely to happen. And ever since yesterday I've been practically shitting myself out of nervousness over this visit and then it amounted to literally nothing. 

God I am so pathetic and incapable of functioning. I'm such a disappointment. I hope I die soon because I clearly just cannot live like a normal person.

155,"For a while I've been struggling with my personality. It seems as if I have several ones? Sometimes I just don't feel like myself, it can go on for days or just a few hours. Whenever I try to search for answers about it, all I get info about is DID which is certainly not the problem. It's just that my personality can have an enormous switch sometimes and I don't feel like myself anymore, even using my own name feels wrong. 

It can vary from feeling like a child and thinking like one, typing like one to feeling like I could beat up 10 people and have no empathy. 

Recently I've started typing in 3rd person using the name Athy. I don't know why but it brings me comfort and helps me dissociate.

I just want to know if I need help with this? It's really annoying not having a solid personality / feelings. My good friend did say they're happy I find good ways to cope so I guess in the end it doesn't really matter. Anyone any thoughts?",28Oct2019,1

160,"Since June of this year I've been having very severe paranoia and anxiety. I thought my relatives were going to torture me for no apparent reason, and then later next month in July I convinced myself that I was going to be poisoned by them for being a nuisance in their relationship.

 For the most part, I have overcome these delusions, but during those episodes I told myself that I better get away from these people to save my life. This left a strain on our relationship, and since we are somewhat close, they are now convinced that I want them to go away or have them die ( which I do not, I love them despite my illness). 

Unfortunately, this has led to a new obsession and paranoid process where since they believe I want them gone they'll care less about my life and possibly harm me. This is a dangerous thought process which is harming my health.

I do have a history of paranoia extending to 2017 where I thought co-workers were trying to harm me or my family, along with random issues with strangers like into a parked car and them feeling the need to retaliate. 

I am currently prescribed risperdal, gabapentin and lorazepam. I also take OTC sleeping aids when needed and I've stopped risperdal because it was giving me an irregular heartbeat. 

Do you know how any medications that will help these thoughts go away, especially to help me sleep?

Also, what would be the most likely diagnosis? My psychiatrist only gave me the medication and didn't want to identify the cause. 

I wouldn't mind going on another antipsychotic only of it doesn't have severe side effects like the irregular heartbeat.",28Oct2019,1
161,"I ask this because I know there I something wrong with me. I've always been depressed, lonely, miserable, anxious and do think about suide a lot but here's a new issue. I'm 28 I started this job during the summer as a contract worker. Job gives me anxiety a bit as I feel like I don't know a lot and have to ask people for help a bit. I've always felt alone here but also at every job. Everyone is nice but I also feel alienated, they have their friends, groups and me well I have me. Anyway one of the girls I heard today will be quitting soon. I had a little bit of a crush on her but I do check myself because 1. You don't date co-workers 2 we barely ever talked other than some pleasantries since I started and 3. I'm what you call an unconfident loser, never even dated anyone and I'm in my late 20s. So I did my best to remind myself she's just another friendly face in the office that has nothing to do with me or I with her.

When I heard she was leaving I instantly got anxious and sad, I'm always sad but this compounded it and it increased my anxiety. Also know another co-worker I talk to sometimes is looking for a new job. I still don't feel like fit in here and I try to remind myself work is not place where I will find happiness, friends and of course love. It's more a source if anxiety and paycheck. I try to forget about it when I'm not there.

I heard the news as I was reviewing a document saying they want to hire me as a real employee. The idea of not taking the job crossed my mind, like I don't belong here and people will leave as I very slowly become comfortable. Also people leaving makes me feel so behind everyone as they are progressing their lives and I'm super behind everyone else at my age not just career wise but everything. I hear people talk about their normal lives and I cannot relate.

162,"All of summer break my dad pulled my mom into a custody battle, resulting in me being in shared parenting. The reason for him taking us to court is because I didn't want to go to his house anymore(I will say why in a bit) and he thought my mom was alienating me; not the case at all. Ever since I was little, my dad verbally abused me; whenever I was being silly he called me retarded, so I became bland and silent over there. Whenever I would eat he would tell me I would get fat, therefore I stopped eating while at his house(I was at his house every other weekend at the time). His house became a living hell and still is today. I no longer wanted to see him and still don't.
         
         Presently I have depression, anxiety, derealization and depersonalization as a result of him. I have told him face to face about how I feel and he only denies everything and gaslights me. I recently resorted to hanging up drawings that represent how I feel and I had pictures of my mom, grandma, and my pets from home. I also had photos of my bedroom that was at home. When my dad saw these, he hung up photos of my step moms family adorned with captions that read ""family time!"" ""(My name)s family!"" and other things like that. (For context, now my dad has me every monday and tuesday, wednesday morning for school, and every other weekend. If its his weekend he gets me after school friday until I leave Wednesday morning) when I was getting ready for school wednesday, he told me that I had to take down all my drawings because they were too morbid. I understand that part, but his reasoning is dumb; he said it was because little kids might come over and see them. I simply told to just keep them out of my room, he was persistent though. The reason why this is dumb is because he raised me on horror movies, playing with dead things, smoking, drunk adult parties, and cruel pranks. I didn't understand why he wants to shield little kids on my step moms side of the family, almost as if he realized I turned out to be a fuck up and didn't want them to be the same. I ended up taking them down along with the photos of my step moms family. I was allowed to leave up the photos of my family and bedroom. As I'm writing this I'm at my dads and while I was gone be found out that I took my step moms family off my wall. He asked me where they were and I told him that I took them home and showed them to my mom and grandma. He told me that he took my photos down as well and he's now holding them for ransom. I can have them back when he gets his photos back. This made me furious.

           I've been depressed as fuck and started cutting with a women's leg razor. It just makes little scrapes, but stings like hell. I don't want to stop though. My dad and step mom have pushed me to the edge and all I want to do is run away from it all, even if that means dying. I know I need serious help, but I fear that if my mom takes my dad to court, the judge won't listen to me and see me as mental. I need advice, any attention all! I'm all ears.",28Oct2019,1
