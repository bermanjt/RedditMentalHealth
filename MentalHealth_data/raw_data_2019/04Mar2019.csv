1,"Does anyone else have friendships ruined because of your mental health. It gets to much for people and than they leave you because ""your mental health is ruining my life"". And apparently my best friend doesn't think friends should help/support each other. So he left me after years of memories. But I changed because of my mental health. Is it m fault? No. I don't believe so. I stopped telling him my issues and yet I'm still negative. Just being next to me apparently gives negative vibes, but I'm not doing anything. It hurts because is it me. Is this why I'm alone. I lost my closest friend because of my GAD and depression.",04Mar2019,1
2,"A friend of mine bought roses for Valentine's day and gave one to me and I still haven't been able to get past how horribly guilty I feel over that flower dying for me.

I used to have these constant dreams where I'd realize there was a hamster cage in my room that I'd forgotten about, and that the hamster inside had babies and all of them had died because I neglected them for so long. I'm so goddamn paranoid this'll happen in real life and it kind of happened with that rose.

I can't make it right. No matter how much I want to. I keep crying on and off.",04Mar2019,4
3,"I hate myself. I can't do anything right, or hold any responsibilities, i'm awful at being a successful healthy person. I've been depressed since I was 12 (im 18 now,) and I've had low self esteem since I was even younger. I can thank my family for that (I think.) As a kid I always cried alot. Recently I got yelled at by my dad because he found out I skipped school that day. After screaming at me he asked me why I was skipping school. The whole time he was screaming at me, I remained pretty collected, didnt say a word, and just looked down. But when he asked me, I opened my mouth to speak, but couldnt. Instead, I started sobbing, and crying. I don't exactly know why, and I didnt want to do it, I hated that I was crying, but I guess I just hated that I was being yelled at? idfk. After like a minute of crying and failing to control myself, I managed to whimper out that i'm depressed, and some other shit. But that reminded me of something I completely forgot about, that I struggled with as a kid. WHENEVER something happened to piss off my parents, even if my other brothers did it, and I shouldn't be blamed, (like if they hurt me and I screamed or something)  when they asked me to explain myself or if I had to defend myself, when I opened my mouth to speak, I started to cry. And I couldn't stop myself from crying, because the more annoyed at myself I got, the more I cried. And obviously I couldnt be taken seriously because i'd sound like a sobbing baby (I hyperventilated when I sobbed so it made it even harder to talk.) So me and everyone else would just give up in hearing my side of the story. 

I want to know why I do this? As a young kid I had pretty normal self esteem but as I got older it just got worse and worse, and I wonder if this is a reason for it. Now, in my family environment, I just stay quiet and it feels like I just have to act a certain way to fit their mold. (I say what they want to hear, laugh when I should laugh, etc.) Recently when my dad yelled at me and he asked me why, it felt like I was stripped naked, because I couldn't give a response which fit to the mold, because that mold involves not pissing off my parents. 

Idk where i'm going with this...

For the past couple of years, some shit things have happened in my life. I had a really weak and insecure ego, I acted like an asshole because I was afraid of being rejected I think. Then, a year ago, I moved to kentucky for a year, and had no friends and basically no family there. My whole ego was crushed, and I lost all self worth, and I tried to attempt suicide. Anyways, this whole time, i've felt completely empty. I've felt lost, unfulfilled, and I hate myself. Recently I've gotten better but I still have a really shitty self esteem and no confidence in myself. Im trying to figure out how to get better and its INCREDIBLY frustrating, because im never sure of anything I do. 

Anyways, has anybody else dealt with the same issue of crying? Does anybody know what its related to? If anyone has any other thoughts about this post please share, i'm just lost and stressed tf out rn",04Mar2019,1

As a result, I end up just being super hard on myself all of the time and constantly striving-- but I'm concerned that if I loosen the reigns at all, I'll end up too complacent or not my best self.

8,"A few weeks ago i attempted suicide for many reasons. One of which was that i believed my bf was going to break up with me.

I come back to school and hear about all this and i go to talk with him. He holds to this day that he has done nothing wrong. He is currently working on getting me blacklisted from coming to his frat events, the brothers of which i am very good friends with. He sees himself as the main victim in this. I’m so frustrated with everything and I’ve had friends support me and I’ve had others agree with him that he’s done nothing wrong. If you have input on this please let me know. Am i the one in the wrong? I’ve been extremely unstable with all this going on and he claims his actions have all been to mitigate further damage between us but it’s only made things worse for me.

I finally pluck up the courage to tell my mum, and she has managed to completely destroy my dreams and my motivation for joining. She went on to say that if I joined the shock would kill my grandparents and their deatjs would be on me, my girlfriend would leave me and she would stand by and basically say I told you so.
My mum has always looked out for me, regardless and this really messed me up to be honest. She wants me to do basically anything else without taking into consideration what I want to do.

I either choose to follow my dreams and then ruin my life. Or do what she wants but be left unfulfilled and depressed.

11,"Already posted this on r/bipolar.

Last year i had my first psychosis. It was probabiy triggered by smoking weed,
alkohol and not sleeping. l was in the hospital for 2 weeks and i got Olanzapine(Zyprexa) perscribed. I was diagnosed with Bipolar1‚butsome of the doctors assumed also Schizophreina or a Schizoid Disorder.

Now it's about 4 months that i'm off of my medication and i can't notice any symptoms. Maybe there are days with slight depression or i get really Iazy.

Could it be that the psychosis was just related to my lifestyle at the time?",04Mar2019,4

13,"Does anyone have experience in treating sleep-talking?

I \[21/F\] have PTSD, depression and anxiety. This morning my SO told me that I said “I don’t want to live anymore” in my sleep, which was super disturbing and creepy. Obviously, it's generally what I feel about my life at this point, however I don’t want that to ever happen again as it really affects my SO (not that I am trying to hide anything from them. I guess we can all agree that hearing stuff like that in the middle of the night is extremely creepy).

Extra information: I mostly sleep talk in language B, which my SO does not speak, and seldom in English, which is the language we speak to each other. Therefore maybe there's someway I could brainwash myself into just sleep talking in language B before I go to bed?

Is there anyone out there who knows some tricks to make the problem go away?",04Mar2019,1

It’s nothing too”special”. All I’ve done is join a discord community for a streamer I like, but for me to join and be trying to be an active member and contributing..that’s actually a really big thing. Problem is that I feel like I’m bothering them all by trying to contribute, that I’m butting in where and when I’m not wanted.

On one hand, I know my anxiety is probably something I’ll have to monitor my entire life. So I want to be okay with that, and learn to live with it and love myself anyways. On the other hand, anxiety and depression is awful sometimes.

19,"Im a 46 yr old male. A few years ago I found myself part of a program for individuals recovering from brain injuries. In my case i had been in a car accident and I had lots of memory issues, a degree of cognitive impairment, minor body tremors and a profound personality shift (ironically it's been a good shift). My official diagnosis is Major Neurocognitive Disorder (a type of dementia) and to compound things I also have Aspergers Syndrome. So I'm rather off center of everyone else. 

Part of the program included in-home services - this included a 40 yr old social worker/therapist named ""Jessica"". ""Jessica"" has a number of degrees is psychiatry &amp; psychology yet she works in a non-licensed position in social work. This woman has/had been awesome! Very helpful in every way. And quite attractive to boot. Over the months we worked together she became the highlight of my week. Every Thursday was ""Jessica"" day... I counted the days until I'd see her. But I never let on how important she was to me. I didn't ever want to risk her becoming uncomfortable with my attraction &amp; asking to be removed from my case. Besides she was married and I respected that - I wasn't about to dabble. And on top of that, since my accident, and all my issues - I felt like the most insecure man on Earth. 

After about 18 months or so we'd become rather close - I'd actually come to trust her. One day, there was something visibly off about her and I inquired... she almost broke down in tears at my inquiry... her husband was going to be leaving her for someone else. I expressed how sorry I was and offered to listen if she ever wanted to vent - I knew from the last 18 months of chit-chat that she really had no friends or family to speak of so she had limited resources for anyone to reach out to - so I was offering her all I could. 

Over the next 2 months we disclosed many things to each other. Mostly about her troubles at home, but also about our feelings for each other - she said she'd been attracted to me since the summer. I revealed my feelings about her. We exchanged Xmas gifts. She wrote me the sexiest most sensuous letter in her Xmas card that I've ever read (my son says she's  ""undercover trying to say that she loves you Dad""). 

By mid January her husband was gone - he'd moved 2 states away leaving her with their 8 yr old daughter. The very day he left she arranged for me to meet her &amp; the daughter at Friendlys for ice cream. I felt like I was being inducted. It was nice... but scary. 

Two days later during one of our regularly scheduled in-home counseling sessions I was eating ""Jessicas"" pussy on my couch. Needless to say things were moving quickly. We had something of a routine at this point, we were getting together most everyday in some capacity outside of our ""official weekly counseling sessions"" ~ daily walks in a park, dinner at her place, dinner at my place, dinner at my sons place with his SO (side note: my son wasn't exactly happy with this relationship, he thought it was VERY inappropriate-he just knew I was happy) 

It was 2 1/2 months since her husband told her he was leaving and we were swapping ""I love you's"" ... I was beginning to think she was almost as screwed up as I was. 

She soon became nervous about being found out by her job for what we were doing... she said we could date more freely AND that she would feel safer if I was no longer in the program. So I left the program. 

Somewhere between her husband leaving and me leaving the program she went into almost a depression. She began growing more &amp; more distant - minimal to no affection. Virtually all terms of endearment vanished. She wanted more time alone. Communication was cut by more than half. About the only thing thats consistent is our daily walks together...and those were awkward and sometimes contentious. 

I know she been seeing a therapist for a couple months. Therapy has gotten more intense for her. She tells me that nothing has really changed between us, but that she just needs time to deal with her husband leaving, to deal with all the residual feelings, we're moving way too fast, that she needs to deal with ""herself"" before ""we"" could ever hope to be anything. 

Here's the kicker: she told me I'm not the first client she's done this with... there was one other... and that's what ultimately drove the wedge between her &amp; her husband. It just took him a bit to get up the will to leave her. 

It seems to me she might be seriously trying to pull her shit together now ... but to what end? She says she doesn't want the husband back - that he was horrible to her for a long time - even before her fling. So then where does that leave me? Am I just the latest ""client/patient"" she's engaged like this with? Am I actually something to her? Or am I just someone she's keeping close now so I don't rat on her and screw up her job/career? 

I'm a complete mess these days! Rampant depression, anxiety, stress - she's really set me back by leaps and bounds. 

I love her so much. But sometimes I wish I'd never met her. Or at least wish I could go back 6 months and never inquired what was wrong that fateful day and just let sleeping dogs lie. 

I'm frustrated all day. In an endless fog of anxiety and confusion ... and then I see her. And it's semi bliss while I'm with her... and it's good. And then it wears off after an hour and then it's misery again. 

Sometimes I wish I'd never met her. I wish she'd left me alone. There's no turning back with her - something has to give. 

My closest and friend ""Sandra"", who I disclosed everything to, wrote out all the facts on paper for me to see and read - and I was suddenly on 'Team Sandra' - she was very angry about the situation and wants me to report the relationship to her superiors. Then I left and met 'Jessica' for a walk in the park around the corner and I was suddenly sucked back in - 'Team Jessica'. 

Last week I sent her an email telling her I was done. 12 hours later we were back on track. I flip-flopped - she said I hurt her feelings - and now I'm back in this cycle of despair. This is like a heroin addiction I can't escape. 

Im beginning to think she might be my very own personal devil. 

I know my cognitive abilities are severely declined and I have trouble with even simple puzzles and adding &amp; subtraction of double digits is difficult at most times... but am I missing the forest for the trees here? 

Should I let this die? She I let ""Sandra"" report this to ""Jessicas"" superiors and be done with things? I'm too close to ""Jessica"" and too close to ""Sandra"" - and I can't trust my own opinion... what do I do people? Help me!",04Mar2019,0

21,"So long story short I am very strongly convinced my husband has BiPolar Disorder and I believe he’s having an episode. When we dated we’d be great for a few months then he’d break up with me. Give him a few months and he’d leave. This happened at least 8 times in our relationship. This is the first time since being married AND HAVING A 17 month old child he’s left. I’m shocked. A few weeks ago he packed up his bags and left me and our child to go back to “mommy dearest” who is just a whole other story. When/if he does come back attempting to come back, how can I help him? When he was HAPPY he used to understand the severity of his actions. Once he spirals and gets into these episodes no one is right, he refuses to acknowledge anything but what he sees. I should mention he’s 25 and extremely immature. He used to stay up VERY late (past 1am to play video games) every night and then wake up at 4am to go to work...when he’d come home from work he’d need to nap....aka no time spent with me and my son.

24,"I'm clinicly depressed I have anxiety and PTSD I'm not on meds because my doctor doesn't want me trial and erroring more meds that might just hurt me or cause permanent damage the soonest reevaluation I MIGHT  be able to go to is in April and my doc won't give me meds until we really find out what's wrong

The back story to this is I've beed struggling with this stuff since I was two my mom was 17 my grandmother being a drug dealer which is how my 16 yo mom found my 21 (I think) yo dad when I was two they had broken up and mom had found a new 30 something BF who really liked kiddy porn and did that with me I was locked up in a crib in a locked room neglected burried alive etc my grandma on my dad's side got custody of me when I was two and adopted me when I was nine 

Being 15 now there's a lot more wrong (grandma [dads mom]will now be mom and her husband im not related to will be dad) (mom is Christian dad isn't) I'm bisexual genderfluid and wiccan so that stuff really doesn't work with her but if a noticed little things she's done that I think are abusive 

She would say she would take away all my clothes exept for a few pairs for normal abused child things and I was really little that stopped before I was 10

She would get on me to clean my room in a bad few months for me (timeframe of having to meet wih bio mom) then when I did something would piss her off and she would -DESTROY- my room then yell at me to go in there and clean it all up last time she did this a few years ago she tried to pick me up by my hair then later calmed it was a demon and not her

Last week I had her come pick me up from school due to a really bad panic attack and I had forgot my comfort items at home (ps we live out of town) we got a call from the school and stopped at a gas station so she could call back and get gas she said I would get out to get it even though I had never done it before and was recovering from over an hour long panic attack she said when she got back in while I was crying that next time she wouldn't pick me up because I didn't want to get out and get gas (implied being lazy) 

This is a big one so my parents found out I masturbated when I had just turned 14 and they freaked out and threatened to put me in an all leather chastity belt (with no research mind you) one I would have to ask for the key to relive myself or to take a shower (I was homeschooled 6th grade to 9th) and they would not bring the key when we went into town they never ended up doing it but still it's classified as a sex toy because I then researched them and you can't wear pants with any of them on because they are visible and I had no dresses at the time also was threatened if I was found to masturbate in the shower my mom would either view me shower or shower with me

With cutting my mom normally gets me in the mood to do it in bulk back when I was 13 I was 100% isolated I had no friends I could only talk with my parents in person so I unhealthy got a boyfriend's that quickly moved away and it became an abusive type relationship I teased and put out once then he would not talk to me for a week then just say ""more"" never getting a compliment I then did that to anyone because of my isolation mom found out took away all of my friends in my phone and a cut a LITTLE bit on the back of my ankles she saw and put in a dumb rule after I got out of a mental hospital I got more PTSD from if she saw more cuts she would inspect me in my underwear to see if I was cutting if I continued my door now with no lock would be taken off if I still cut no private showers still? No private bathroom trips under my underwear? Nude inspections

(Last year) When she found of I was gender fluid she was the ""your not a lesbian right?"" I expressed how much I needed to cut my hair and how bad my made up word disphoria was she told me to wait for my dad to get used to kinda looking like a dude thing and couldn't handle it after 1-3 weeks and cut it myself she proceded to ground me from any girls clothes at home whatsoever 100% guy at home but in public I had to wear my pink wig I had to wear makeup and I had to wear super girly clothes for a month to the point I was getting disphoria  from looking like a guy so much

When I was younger before I was adopted she constantly threatened me with Satan and going back to bio mom one time she shoved me outside barefoot at night for a minute to make me think she kicked me out

I regress sometimes and use ddlg type things to help me with hopefully controlling it (regression for me a terrified 4 year old child who has the mindset of just being beat also can not control in anyway when it pops up) the first time it happened I was in the kitchen quite a few years ago 11-12 I think maybe yonger idk what really happened but my dad was sitting at the island and my mom was in front of me I flinched or something being terrified of being hit and she started yelling at me she then backed me into a corner of the countertop and pretented she was gonna hit me then said she should beat me and my dad agreed

I have stretch marks on my back the ones that kinds look like you could have been wipped and one time in the car to my old theripist last year she got really upset and made me promise I would say they wipped me and repeatedly said stuff like because they didn't 

My mom thinks because I don't love her I could stab her and kill her with any knife I own (I have none over 3 inch and we have a watermelon knife the size of a machete but with sa2 blades) I can for some reason hold her back by saying then you have to get every larger knife out of the house

She's also used the ""but I went to court for you and spent time and money and love"" card a few times a while ago




These are really spread out and jumbled out of order but my mom really doesnt understand why I don't love her and gets mad when I bring one of those up ""THAT WAS SO LONG AGO WHY CANT YOU FORGIVE ME IVE DONE SO MUCH FOR YOU"" type of thing

I haven’t felt any emotions in a while l, I think because I’ve had several concussions in the past few years, but they are starting to come back and every emotion is just so overwhelming, even happiness is almost too much for me now. How do I go about opening up to my friends, I feel like if I open up it can be used against me and I think that’s why I never have. Any advice is welcome because this is an entirely new thing for me. Thank you. ",04Mar2019,0
34,"I got sick this morning and had to call out of work. I out of nowhere began feeling guilty about being sick. Like I’m sick, therefore I’m a piece of garbage that doesn’t deserve to work. Add on to that, this has caused a major flare up of my anxiety and depression that has been inescapable for the whole day. I feel guilty for being a burden on my mom, who had to cancel plans to help take care of me. Which in turn added to the flare up. I’m sick of being sick and I’m sick of being a burden.",04Mar2019,1
35,"I think I've had anxiety and OCD my whole life.  I have always been obsessive over small things, the insignificant things. Like how I moved my hands when someone was talking to me, the tone of my voice when I was speaking, the responses I want aren't coming. Did I sound enthused about them? Was I too enthused? Will they remember me? Am I worth anything? 

I would always re organize my room, something had moved just a bit and I would want to re-arrange everything. I struggle to finish any art I do for ""fun"" because its not perfect. I've been assigning numbers to people for as long as I can remember, Im 22. I don't know why, I just do. My close friends have numbers my parents don't - everyone says its something with seeing letters as colors but I just see people as numbers, the good people. I remember all of these events, I remember how my room used to look, life before a brother, life without my pets.

Yet I can't remember what being happy was like. I've had depression for 4ish 5 years now, I cant pin down a day when ""the hammer struck"" I just know that one day I started to look in the mirror and hated myself more and more. I've been going through a really rough patch for 7 months. I have only just recently told one of my dearest friends. Shes been great and really supportive. I still feel broken. The more time I sit alone the more I feel like I should end everything. The only thing that keeps me here is my pets. If I killed myself today, no one would care for them. They would starve, my baby girl, my crested gecko, shes 4, I hatched her she would starve, she wouldn't survive, my parents don't care about her. My fish would die, lack of food or water changes. They have been my only anchor for as long as I can remember. 

I feel overwhelmed. There does not seem to be a point in living if  I cant remember how to be happy. I feel like I've fucked up my relationship. I feel like I cant trust her, everything says I should, shes kind and genuine and puts in the effort to give me thoughtful gifts. I feel like I am stabbing her in the back and cheating her out of knowing me because I'm too scared to tell her how I feel. I feel like I am broken for not wanting sex. I wonder why she stays with me even though I feel worthless. Do I have a personality? Is she with me because its ""convenient"". I keep myself busy and so does she. I notice a lot of the same  tendencies in her but I don't know for a fact that shes going through the same thing. I cant talk to her because shes busy, she feels the same hurt I do when I'm alone. But i'm always alone. I have my animals and I have and Dark souls. I've only ever had myself.

 Its one of the only games I can play day after day because I relate to the world and the message of the game. The celebration of life and the want to continue on despite the same trials over and over again. I fight being alone I fight feeling worthless, but I cant join her in her fight. I sit and watch from 3000 miles away someone struggle and find small copes that only keep them above the water. I want to live and I hope that  eventually I will remember what it is like to be happy. I hope that one day Ill be able to look outside and praise the sun. I hope that one day I will feel like I deserve love and can finally let myself be happy. I hope that one day, Ill be able to talk to my S/O without feeling like I need to hide how broken I am. I hope that eventually I can make the world better for people like me. 

And maybe if I keep Dark Souls and my pets close to my heart, Ill be able to remember what being happy was like. I want to live, I just need to remember how. and maybe one day Ill be able to help her in her battles and hope that I can trust her with mine.

40,"The following is a real situation that happened.   
TLDR.  


I visited a psychologist. She asked unbelievable questions and now I don't trust any.  


&amp;#x200B;

I decided to visit a psychologist.   
what happened next scares me years later, sitting at my desk revisiting that day.   


I have always been different.   


maybe it's because I grew up in a cult, but thinking back on that day chills me to my core.   


The  psychologist was recommended because my adopted father recommended visiting one. Disclaimer, he was after a disability check. Hoping I had Aspergers syndrome which doesn't clearly fit my personality. I'm not skittish, I'm just.. focused.   


I was asked questions about ''my day''   


My day at that time consisted of waking up, eating a quick breakfast and going directly to the computer where I worked on filling out resume's to get a job, with the intent of leaving the parents home as quickly as possible.   


living a life where someone hopes you have a mental condition is wearing on ones soul and I'm aware of this.. I'm also aware that letting her know this would be a mistake, so I fed her some bullshit story about getting up and reading. (which I also did)  


For some reason she fixated on my cooking skills. Yes. I can cook. is it so strange that I was going into detail when she asked me to about cooking? that's not a day. That's just something you need to do.  I was slightly annoyed which I think she picked up on.   


but I played along. I even considered actually opening up and getting some real life advice, after all that's what her job is right?  


fortunately for my she decided to get into tests. 

tests that I did very well on and unfortunately disqualified our family from getting a disability check.

But I don't care about any of that.   


What I care about.. what bothered me to this day was her next question. A question I have put into Google search, and browsed message board on people who work in psychology and have never come across any instance of it. 

now I know what led to that question.   


A long time ago we had a loser who stayed at our house.  He was a guy from the streets, and we took him in to help. In return there was around a year of the guy sneaking off, smoking and pretending no one could smell it, and pretending to harm himself. Well one day he pointed a knife at my mother and I snapped.   
I'm a short guy. I told him if he took another step it would be his last and in that moment I meant it.   
the bigger guy realized I wasn't playing around, put the knife down, and soon was out of our lives.   
we simply told the agency ''this is not working out'' and I never heard from him again.   


back in the room, sitting in the chair I asked the psychologist to repeat her question. 

  
*if someone was trying to kill you, how would you react?*

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't expect that. I didn't know if she was working from the story of what had happened, if this was a stranded question asked of clients or what her angle was., 

But stupid me I told her the truth of that time.   


*my life does not hold much meaning right now. if it would impact other people I would fight. but if it was just me I would examine the circumstances and decide in the moment. it's easy to imagine letting someone just end me without any thought on my part. not because I'm suicidal, no I have never had a thought like that in my life. but death is something that happens and if it was happening to me without a way to prevent it I would go peacefully.*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Still I didn't realize that something was..wrong.   
heck I don't know many psychologists, if I did  I wouldn't be in this situation.   


that flashback came to mind. The guy standing in the kitchen with a knife pointed at her. not *quite at her* as in a ''I'm going to stab you right now'' way but getting there. watching her flee in terror and close the bathroom door. I knew what she was doing. praying to God to save her while I stared down the threat. 

&amp;#x200B;

From what I understand he had been told he wasn't allowed to go to a party, where he would return on drugs. He decided to make that no a yes with a knife. Except he had told me before in detail how he wanted to cut someone slowly and watch their blood run down. Now he had a chance.   


Back to that room. Back to the chair with the psychologist and her damned clipboard scribbling down notes on how I made cheese omelets.   


I took a deep breath, banished the memory and answered true. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think my mother would require someone stronger to help her in that event. I think she would fall apart and not have the mental capacity to do anything other than protect herself afterwards. in the event of her being about to die. she would need someone to save her.   


*holy fuck i will never forget the gleam in pshycies eyes when she wrote my answer*

She then asked he following   


Have you ever shot a gun?

Have you ever been in a situation where you have had to use force? 

Do you feel remorse when you do bad things? (like what? things. any things.. like punch a baby)  


I started to feel *drained.* like this was not right. 

each question she asked was worse and the last one I remember was 

*have you ever had someone make you do something you dont want to do?*   


She straightened, then said okay! with a cheery smile. I'd like to talk to your mother!

uh.. sure. Why?

I'd just like to ask her some questions. 

sure. I said. Walked out. she looked up from her game Oh! you were gone a long time.. are you.. 

Lets go. I said pretty much pushing her out the door.   


it's almost ten years later and I remember this with startling detail.   


I do not to this day trust any psychologist. The line of questioning I was given was morbid, unnecessary, not required for the assessment of Aspergers and just seemed.. evil.   


it crossed my mind that maybe that day with the knife was the real reason of this visit. Doubtful. I got yelled at for failing the tests. After a few months the office stopped trying to reschedule another appointment.   


I never went back. and up until now I have never uttered a word about this, except for one sparse interation with mom doing the dishes.   


All of a sudden she stopped. Do you remember that time we brought you to that place for a psyc eval? 

yeah?  


.. I didn't like your psychologist. She seemed .. well.   
Evil?

yeah kindof. was everything okay?

yeah mom don't worry. I'm sure that was just her personality. Besides she had another client so I'm sure she was rushed.  don't worry she was fine. it's all in the past. 

*How easily I was able to reassure her made me think maybe I should visit a psychologist*  


and it is.

41,"First off, sorry for any bad formatting. I've always been particularly trash at writing things.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I am currently a high school student in grade 12. When I was around 10 or 11 my parents went through a nasty divorce and since then I have always felt as though my father ditched myself and my brother. About a year after, my brother started playing basketball very often and my mom had to take him to all his practices and games since he is actually pretty good. So within the span of a year or so I went from having someone around the house at all times with me to being alone most of the time. Over the years I have slowly built up a lack of emotion towards my family and close friends.

&amp;#x200B;

Around October of 2018 I started smoking weed with some of my friends, and for once feel as though I have some people who care about me. Since then, I talked to my dad about it, (he was cool with it) and our relationship has been getting better, but I still feel as though I can't trust him fully. Pretty recently my mom found out I have been smoking and she is not too pleased with it. I don't know why but I feel as though I should be more upset or feel bad about disappointing my mom, but I feel nothing towards it, and I am kind of concerned. If anyone is willing to help talk me through this it would be greatly appreciated.",04Mar2019,1
42,"Hi I wanted to ask if you think i exhibit any signs of mild depression. I have been thinking about this for a while and I just have to get this off my chest.

[CONTEXT]
I recently moved to America last year and I'm in my last year of highschool. For some odd reason my will, passion, drive or general deaire for learning has just disappeared. I was an honor student before and I still get straight A's here. The only problem is that I tend to skip school a lot in the US. I never did that before in my home country. I used to actually like going to school. 

Maybe its due to the fact that I don't have the same type of friends. I do have plenty of friends here, though just not the same as back home. Maybe its because class starts way too early here. Maybe because of the different  classroom set up.

Where I come from, you have one room for the entire day for the entire year, here its 7 classrooms for each day and a bigger school population.

I just chalked it up to me being lazy but I just had to ask for a different opinion. I have trouble sleeping, My sleep schedules seems wack and I always tend to be tired. I tend to know care more about my self image, eventhough no one is really bullying me or anything. I just tend to worry less about important stuff and stress about other things.

Am i just home sick or do I actually have something that I need to talk to a therapist about. I don't really know what to do, I just hope i won't stay like this through college.

43,"I don’t mean having heightened senses, like you can see or hear really well. What I mean is, it’s kind of like misophonia, but it’s not just sound, it’s light and odors too. 

Every day when I wake up, the world is just too much. Too bright and too loud. Even strong smells make me want to retreat. It does improve, but I need at least an hour or two, sometimes more, before I can tolerate having bright lights or music or the TV on, or even listening to someone eat. It’s like I have to gradually ease into existence, every single day. 

Later in the day, after I’ve been awake for a long time, I can handle the world just fine for the most part. 

Anybody know what this is called? I’ve had it for years but didn’t when I was a kid. ",04Mar2019,3
44,"I would like some opinions, similar experiences or advice.

Ever since i was little, very rarely i would hear people calling my name even tho it was unlikely for someone to do that at the time. I did not thought much of it for the most part since it always happend in public places and i would usually turn my head to check who it was calling only to assume that it must have been another person with my name being called.

&amp;#x200B;

At teenage years, when sitting at home late at night with parents out or simply listening to my music, i would hear people talk. Nothing unusual as living in a house directly adjacent  to the next one. Even when it happend late at night i just assumed it would be the neighbours, the tv in the living room downstairs or comming from my sisters room upstairs.

&amp;#x200B;

It was only recently that i started to think more of it. For some reason i have been living with these voices or sounds all my life, frequently or not depending on how good or bad i feel, without thinking much of it or talking to someone about it. It's just there and i got used to it.  I am 29 now and these voices have been with me since i am very little. 

They never scared me or made me uncomftable. The more i focus on them the clearer they get.

&amp;#x200B;

The feeling i get from those voices comforts me. Like when you're little and falling asleep at your parents 'parties' - when hearing people around gave you a level of comfort and security. Like the engine if your dads car humming as you have the greatest man alive giving you a ride home late, to the place where you love everything and everything loves you, occasionally checking on you as you pretend to be asleep. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know i must sound like a maniac already. How can someone possibly be okay with voices in their head or why did i not go and find mental help and to be honest, i never felt it was anyones buisness to get involved. In some way i protected what i had.  I am considering consulting a professional now tho and the reason for that follows.

Nothing that i would consider 'bad' happend and i also can not really think of anything that i thought was traumatic but the voices turned into noises that sound similar to strong winds passing the window. Somtimes one of the voices i usually heared tangled up in a vast ocean of windy, unclear sound. I describe those sounds as if they were a strong overwhelimg force but in reality, they are still very subtile and easy to miss or overhear. The feelings i get from this are so strong too. It feels like they need my attention or even asking for help. Never before have i encountered the feel of these voices having a existence or consciousness behind them. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's my first attempt to try and explain my situation and english is my second language so bear with me please.

Usually i would just 'deal' with it and move on but if there is a chance that someone out there has similar experiences or advice im taking it.

I don't want to self diagnose, but idk what's wrong with me, my guess was maybe schizophrenia because I heard that comes from psychedelic use. It's hard to describe but I'm severely depressed, feel very little emotion, and I constantly feel like I'm going insane. All day my mind just does scary things. I'll see a window and my mind will picture me smashing my head through it and being stabbed over and over. I'll see my own finger and not recognize it as my own and it'll trigger a million thoughts of it being like a demons finger. And I can't stop the thought progression till another pops in.

It's hard to describe and I've heard the saying if you think you're a psychopath then you're not. So I know that's not it. So I really have no idea what's happening.

48,"I don’t really have anyone to talk to, and this seems like an area I’m able throw down what’s going through my head and can rant. So here’s a quick run through of where I’m at in life and what I’m stuck with hopefully get some ideas and maybe see how those experiencing similar issues can relate.

Right now I’m 19 just recently quit community college because I felt it wasn’t for me even though I chose a degree program (accounting) even though I never had an interest in this field. I finished the semester though for two reason one would be so I would be safe from having to repay my financial aid loan which could’ve costed me thousands, as well as in case I wanted to try again and actually be accepted for financial aid. The main thing going through my head from this experience is that I keep thinking maybe if I tried something I liked than I’d enjoy it.

Semesters over, come my 19th birthday and a little bit of thinking about my life between this time, I have come to multiple conclusions about where I should lead my life from here. My first option was to attempt another semester of community college with a field that I may be more optimistic about (computer science). My second idea is that I could join the military since I’ve always felt a small desire to serve and I know I have a timer when it comes to this decision. My final decision was to go to work with my dad who is a window installer.

I chose that I’m going to join the work force with my dad and all is going well. It turns I’m pretty good at construction who would of thought, I’m got a pretty good paycheck at the end of the week, and my dad who usually settles for bad employees has me who actually is catching on really quick so he making more money than he ever had in a long time. I’ve been construction for about three months a beginning to feel as if this isn’t something I can see myself doing for a career. I’m starting to think about my ability to still try college again, as well as I still watch military stuff in the internet and still feel the desire to serve. But now I’m stuck at the thought that if I should do what I think what is best for my future but my mind counters this idea with the fact that worker with my dad has built a stronger relationship between us, he’s been noticeably happier, and he’s not as financially stressed which decreased many of the arguments between him and my mom. The first thought that comes to my head is that if I quit working for him than it’s all going to go back to how it used to be and I’d immediately blame myself.

I like working with my dad because we spend more time together since I’m normally cooped up playing video games in my free time. The money’s good and Im not following the footsteps of immediate gratification but I feel but something in my heart tells me this is not what I’m meant to and there’s more for me out there but I find it difficult to stomach the idea ruining the progress that my father is making now as well.

another in short: i have a lot of anxiety when it comes to anything medication-related as i’ve never been medicated for anything that wasn’t an antibiotic, and i’m a severe hypochondriac, like severe ((so debilitating at times that i’m nearly convinced i have undiagnosed OCD, which i’ll find out about soon))

so i’ve been treated with natural chinese herbal medicine (which honestly has not helped as much as i wish it did). for a short time i got acupuncture treatment and it was wonderful but it got to be very expensive and i had to stop.

the past few months, maybe since the start of last fall, have been a slow burn into probably the worst depression episode of my life. this past week, when i hit rock bottom and i couldn’t get out of bed or leave the house, i phoned a psychiatrist for an appointment, because enough is enough and i need medicine to live.

but see a huge thing that has kept me from meds for a long time are the side effects. i hear they can make you really sick and i’m just scared that at the first sign of not feeling well i’ll start to spiral and think i’m dying?

TL;DR after only being on unsuccessful alternative herbal medicine i’m going to be starting meds for the first time soon, but i’m a hypochondriac and terrified of the side effects

my question is: what were your experiences with side effects when you started meds the first time? is there anything you wish you’d done or told your psychiatrist before you began them? and how did/do you treat your side effects?

As y’all might know I’m a firm believer of Mental Health and also advocate about it and with my blogs I look forward to help people and the community.

For me Mental Health is all about ‘**the way of expression’** if you can express properly then *Son, you’re on the right track*. Being expressive does not always mean to be an extrovert but what I mean by ‘expressive’ is speaking what you feel.    

So, in 2019 if you want to stabilise and then improve your Mental Health then you need to keep a proper check on your emotions. Now, I’ll be mentioning 7 emotions to take care of in 2019 to improve your Mental Health and also how to improve your mental health.

So I truly am happy for him that he has another paying gig until he finds a more permanent job. 

But I've also been freaking out all damn day! 

Cause what if he figures out I just suck, I truly am boring. We live in a boring ass town and the only bit of real excitement is the movie house and the gay club where we met. So eventually he's gonna realize how boring I am and find someone better to be his bestie and I don't want that.

He messaged me this afternoon and told me about his client, and said he'd message me later if they didn't show up and I messaged 3 hours later cause...he didn't message me back. They of course showed up and I told him ""it's great and hope y'all have fun"" cause again, it really is great and he really is fun to be around and if they have fun maybe he'll get more clients and will be able to get his own place even and he won't be sad anymore. And I really do want him to be happy. 

I just want to be there with him. Is that bad?

&amp;#x200B;

Seriously it physically hurts and I know it sounds all kinds of fucked up so what I'm asking is what do I do? Obviously messaging now is crazy, especially cause it's nearly midnight, I guess I need a distraction until I can go to sleep but I don't know what? Should I message him first tomorrow or wait until he messages me if he does?

(seeing hearing or feeling something that isn't really there)

**VISUAL:** Sometimes I can't tell if my eyes are just stupid, or I'm hallucinating. Most of the times I see things is when it's dark. Like right now, I see splotches of colors and dots and shadows that I KNOW now aren't really there, once I turn on the lights. It's like I see colors that literally don't exist. New colors. Its really hard for me to just focus and write this. because whenever I think about it and try to talk about it, I cant. I blame my stupid brain for that though. About once a week I'll get a more extreme (I guess is the best way to describe it) hallucination. I hate calling them hallucinations though because I know I see it and that word is just so stupid to me, the most recent thing I have seen is the scariest to me, I looked in the mirror by my bed and my face's reflection was on the other side of the room? Some of the other things ive seen are faces in walls, doors and beside me that obviously arent really there cause they have no body. But it feels really real to me. The earliest visual hallucination I had was when I was about 6 or 7, I saw this giant blow up snowman (in summer) outside our backyards sliding door, my mom thought I was possessed or some shit and just passed it off. 

**AUDITORY:** Thought visual was it? no, bitch I hear and feel things that aren't really there too! The first time I heard something was when I was 8. I heard the radio playing and it slowed down and stopped, so I turned to my mom and said ""why did you stop the music"" and she told me ""It wasn't even on"" and I remember being so confused. I dont hear things as much as I feel things or see things so this part will be shorter I guess. The most recent was when I heard some man scream ""FUCK"" in my ear really loud. dont know why I heard that but it happened. sometimes ill hear someone whispering or whatever too. its kinda normal to me now, so it almost feels pointless that I'm making such a big deal out of it..

&amp;#x200B;

**FEELING:** *yeah, woop woop. super fun. feeling things that aren't really there. Never* being able to tell if my house is haunted, or if I'm just a schizo. Sometimes its just feeling something touch my leg or back or neck, and sometimes it's feeling a presence of someone. And from whatever the presence is, Is this constant feeling of judgement. like I'm being judged and someone is controlling my brain, and it's NOT me. This feeling of judgement makes me paranoid. It stops me from doing normal things like showering, eating, and sometimes talking or saying certain things. Like my brain is telling me to not say or do something or else ill get a feeling that something terrible is going to happen. But my brain knows how to get me to listen. pretending to be people such as people from books, movies, shows or celebrities. and that sounds so fucking stupid and ridiculous. its  one of the things my brain doesnt let me say. it doesnt let me say it because it doesnt want anyone to know. it doesnt want me to know, and I dont want my brain to know I know. (if I talk about this part any longer I'm going to have a panic attack)

**P  A  R  A  N  O  I  A  (my brain)**

Probably the worst part about my brain. \^ from the previous paragraph. If it weren't for paranoia I would be able to tell everyone everything. I would be able to talk or write or type without being distracted. typing all this dumb stuff makes me feel so fucking stupid. I feel like people are watching me type it or just st- (a moment of me realizing how fucking dumb I am and how I should literally just fucking die). I can't describe how agitated and paranoid I am 75% of the time without wanting to die. Everyone (I just saw a shoe fall from the ceiling)  just thinks I'm an emo teen. SKSKSKSKKSSKKSS (sorry I give up) im done. stop typing. thats stupid. well why did you say that? (that was me saying everything in my head for three seconds. its like 3 people. 3 people are talking in my head, there is me, sassy bitch, and weird thing. ill see if im allowed to describe them later. When it comes to anxiety, I'm only anxious about presentations and my paranoia, I'm anxious about my paranoia.

  Yeah sorry. Most of the time I'm a narcissist, and like 40% of the time I feel like I am the worst human on the planet and I should have been aborted or something. I can go from loving myself to hating myself in like 2 seconds for absolutely no reason. At the moment, I love myself I feel like a handsome gorl and I feel sassy and just happy. When I feel shitty, I draw. The things I draw would scare you so ill post them later maybe? Let me tell you tho, I'm always feeling agitated and annoyed, not just because im a girl and I bleed once a month. I dont feel the way I do when im on my period 24/7. That would fucking suck. One of the only things that makes me happy is being social, and having friends. Having friends makes me realize that people other than my annoying family like me. (which just feeds my narcissism) I do feel bad for other people. I feel bad when people don't have the confidence I do, I want to chop off a chunk of my confidence and give it to them. That would be nice.  I AM an empath. I feel for other people, I'm not completely evil.   I gotta stop now, if I dont stop talking about this right now ill be extra bitchy and I dont think anybody reading this would want that in their life, sooo…..

58,"I had to make a throwaway, sorry. My husband knows my account and I don't want him dealing with this mess. It would make things worse. 


I turn 26 next month. If you live to be 100, that's only 1/4th of your life. But that's the best part, in my opinion. That's all I've dreamed about. All I've wanted. And it's been wasted. 

My entire life I've dreamed of very few things. Creating beautiful costumes, cosplaying, going into acting, becoming a gymnast, writing. This is my entire identity. Who I am. I live, eat, and breathe these dreams. 

My childhood was a nightmare. I bounced around from foster home to foster home. I have sever PTSD, ADHD, OCD, and other related problems. I have been unable to hold a steady job. I married my first boyfriend. We plan to move in together next year when he transfers to my area. We currently see each other once a month for a few days. He's slightly autistic. 

I turn 26 next month. It's time for me to 'grow up', get a job, become a mother. Things I've always, always wanted to do, but they were 'later'. Once I had a chance to explore, be free, reclaim my youth. It was always in the future. Now it's staring me in the face. I've done nothing. Non of my dreams, non of the 'normal' things people do. Nothing. 

What have I done in my life? I've gotten fat. I have a third grade education. I read all day. I only leave the house once a week if I have to. I have no friends, no social life. The people I relate to best are 60+ years old. The people I *want* to relate to are 15-17. 

Some of my dreams are time sensitive. Example, I want to be one of the 'pretty girls' you see in the store. Not beautiful, but put together well. I want to wear bright makeup - blue, green, orange. I want to wear the trendy clothes. I want to dress like I'm 17. I'm not. Age appropriate clothes are things I've thought of as 'later'. 

""Screw them, do it anyway"" you say.  Sure. But then everyone will think I'm having a mid life crisis. I refuse to grow up. I'm immature. ""But you know you're not"" but I want to be SEEN as someone, someone to look up to, someone to want to BE. Not one of 'those' girls. I want to be pretty. Instead I sit on the couch eating snickers bars and hate myself for it. I'm firmly in the 4-5 area of pretty. I want to be a 7. I hate myself when I don't move towards my dreams, and the crushing hate pushes me further into my depression. 

--------

My husband, who I've known since I was a child. My first boyfriend. My first kiss. My first hug. My first sex. My first everything. Do I actually want him? Or did I settle because I don't know better? Are these those horrible self doubt thoughts I struggle with? Or are they real? What if I'm trying to CONVINCE myself they're real, and don't want to be with him? What if I leave him, only to find I want him back? 

He's a 4 or 5 in the looks area with me. I don't deserve someone prettier, I'm not pretty enough. But I WANT a 9. I crave it. I crave the stereotypical romance man. I want someone who will sweep me off my feet, go dancing. Instead he just agrees with me when I decide to paint the hallway puke green because he literally doesn't mind. It's good for me, it is. But I WANT fire, I want passion, I want to argue, debate. Instead I have a big, cuddly bear who loves me unconditionally, who doesn't mind whatever I want to do. Who doesn't have an opinion on the house color.  He's perfect for my mental problems. But... What if I could do better? What if I'm lying to myself? What if the doubt is just my need to self sabotage, and I actually DO like him? When we're apart I don't miss him. When we're together we fit like a perfect couple. Like we've been married years. I'm HAPPY with him. I truly am, I think. But I want to date, to break up, to have an ex. 

Back to time. I want to learn to be as flexible as the people at the circus. It's always been my dream. I've been dreaming of it since my father took me to the circus as a child. It's all I've wanted. I'm 26 now. When those people are retired, their body no longer as flexible. I've missed my prime, when my body COULD have been at its best. 

I want to cosplay. But again, I'm too old. If I get into it now, my youthful looks won't be as well seen. I'll be a 'freak' who needs to retire. A gaming nerd. The type of people I want to hang out with are no longer active in the activity. I'd be ashamed to get into the hobby now. I don't have the figure for the people I want to do anyway. 

I've wasted my entire life. I'm out of shape, I can't imagine having the strength to get back into shape, and I hate that I've missed all I've wanted to do. I hate being 26. I hate that I'm 'old'. I hate my parents, my situation, life. 


But you know what? Today sucks. Tomorrow sucks. I want to cry whenever I think of the future, what I've missed. But.. I'm still happy. I still strive for the future. I still WANT to become a better person. Sure, I have an eating disorder. But when I move out, my husband has agreed to help me learn to eat right. Sure, I can't work. But I can get an online education with the support of my husband. He's offered to sit down and do worksheets with me. Maybe I've missed cosplaying, but I can still get a degree in theater and design costumes for the children. Maybe I can't be flexible, but someday I may be able to dance. When I move out the future opens up for me. I'll be able to do everything I've wanted. I'll be able to flourish, be the person I want to be. 

But I'll be 26.  Accepting that maybe it's too late to do some of my dreams is soul crushing. I can't imagine life ever getting better. I can't imagine a day when I'm skinny, when I can do a back bend, when I can walk more than ten feet without sitting. 

I have two very strong clashing sides of me. One half is firmly in the “Screw this, when you move out you'll flourish, this will settle, and you will have an EPIC life. You can discover new hobbies, become a mother, do whatever!” but the other side is going “What if? You've missed the best part of your life! You'll never do the dreams you've had since a child. That Twix bar is going straight to your thighs. You will NEVER be skinny. Give up.” 

My life situation is stable now, so instead of having an outward battle to fight, I now fight an inward battle of self doubt and self sabotage. It's hard. It's the hardest thing I've ever done. Living on the streets, the eating disorder, the anxiety. I'd take it back to be rid of this horrible self doubt, self hate. 

But underneath it all, I know I'll get better. I'm seeing a therapist. I've been to my doctor for the first time in ten years. I had my teeth filled. I still walk on the treadmill twice a day – and try to talk myself out of it every single time. I hate myself now, but I know that someday, somehow, I'll look back and see what a beautiful butterfly I've become. I just hope that when that day finally comes, I won't be too old to enjoy it. 


I'm sorry, I know there isn't a question here. I haven't been able to admit any of this to anyone in my life. I don't want to be coddled, I don't want the truth. I can't handle the crushing reality, how upset my husband will be if he finds out. But I needed to admit it *somewhere*, if only for a moment. I don't expect any replies, but I promise I'll refresh this page at least six times before bed looking for them anyway. I'm hoping that by admitting this - even to internet strangers - will somehow help me be able to deal with it. I hate this time in my life. I look forward to the future. I want it here now.

59,"My mental state is just plummeting down. I don't regularly take my antidepressants because of how empty they make me feel but I'll take a massive dosage 5-7x larger than my usual 50mg at least once a week. I only really want help now after having recently taken a huge dose and waking up having to throw it all up. At the time I didn't consider it one but I guess it was really just another suicide attempt. 

It's honestly really hard for me to talk to my parents about my mental issues, I just don't trust them because of their behavior last time I tried to talk about one of my now six suicide attempts. Unfortunately I have to talk with them to get a psychiatric eval so I'm at a loss. 

It's just so hard to continue onwards, I get horrible flashbacks in my dreams and intrusive thoughts in the day that make me obsessive and worried about shit constantly. I don't really want to die but I don't want to live like *this*, a complete mess of a person constantly coming to school strung out on his meds and other random drugs.

Chris rejects Amy in a harsh way, and Amy is crushed because she had trusted Chris. She breaks down and has suicidal thoughts, but her friends support her and she seemed to be getting over it.

&amp;#x200B;

**SYMPTOMS** A couple of days later, however, she starts saying weird stuff (she is not taking drugs):

\- “I am thankful to everyone, my parents, all the singer songwriters and artists”

\- “I haven’t slept for 2 days straight, music is a drug”

\- “Some higher power is at work making \[Chris and I\] complement each other”

\- “I’ve won, I love the world, all I had to do was accept that I’m insane, I’m so high right now and I’m so happy“

\- “Chris triggered a PTSD in me. I spiritually and mentally died. Old me is not here anymore.”

Other things:

\- According to her there are 12 souls (her close friends) connected through music, and she needs to save them

\- Chris is her twin?soulmate? And they belong together, they are the same beings, twin flames

\- Chris is the ocean and she is the water

\- She doesn’t eat at all (49kg / 168cm as of early Feb), doesn't exercise

\- This has been going on for a month

&amp;#x200B;

Basically she is weird… like very weird. She seems to have gone through some transformation after deep introspection (she is a serious, serious thinker) and now has a spiritual/delusional take on the world. As much as I’d want to believe this is her way of getting over her shock, it makes me very worried when she says things like *“me and Chris are going to be one forever / we have telepathy*”, and that Chris has already broken up with her girlfriend (all of which I have confirmed with Chris that is **not** true). She has also been trying to drag her best friend into her beliefs and I find that disturbing. She doesn’t respond when we ask more about her beliefs / her situation with Chris, so we don’t know how to approach this (we are all out of country and there is nobody around her who we can trust).

She currently lives with her parents. She doesn’t have a job. All she does these days is make playlists on Spotify.

Regarding her PTSD – she has a history of being abandoned by mean friends during high school, and we think that’s what she is referring to.

&amp;#x200B;

Given all of that I have a couple of questions:

1. Is this, in any way, a transition that can result in something healthy? I know this sounds off but have there been accounts of this kind of behavior leading to a better recovery?
2. Is this considered schizophrenic / psychotically delusional? I’ve read that it could get better in a month or can develop into something even worse (so not really an answer), but is there any medication that can help?
3. What is the best course of action here? We may be able to meet her in person in a month’s time, but until then, should we be aiming to do something, or leave her alone without confronting it?
4. We want her to see a psychiatrist but we don’t know if she’ll accept it, what are some other non-offensive remedies that she might allow?

And please don’t judge her dating choices, it's unrelated to the subject...

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you.",04Mar2019,3

83,"I am seeking advice on what I think is a problem for my friend. He is m39 and he has been suffering from mental health problems for 20 years.
He is diagnosed with schizophrenia and depression and is living alone and is on welfare. He is kinda of a shut in, but is connected with a local psychiatric institution where he goes almost daily to socialize and hang out with the staff/other patients.

The last 10 years he has been in and out of forced psychiatric treatment for periods of months, when he has been struggling with his grip on reality and drifting into psychosis. 
Now he is kind of well, being on heavy medications - although recently  I find his behavior and thought patterns a bit alarming; conspiracy ideas, beginning alcoholism, strange (at least to me) stories about his hearing being so good that he can hear like a car driving along a road miles and miles away - things I know that is impossible to hear with a human ear and other bizarre sensory inputs both audible and visual. 
Now I don`t try to confront/debate him too much, as I don`t have good experiences with that in the past. Rather I just say that I
don`t agree with him and that it`s kind of ok to have different ideas about things. About the sensory stuff, I know its a part of his diagnosis and its not wrong but im not sure that they are good signs. I do however hint that he shouldn`t be drinking so much, but he always blocks me and insists that there is no problem. I try too be his friend and not counselor, and I think both we and our friendship deserves to be just two buddies hanging out and talking about `normal` stuff.

But allright let me get to the point:

He never has the lights on at his apartment, night or day. I noticed it driving/walking by his place about 4-5 months ago and always thought he was out or asleep when I didn`t see any lights on
But then when I visited him (we spend an evening together usually once every 7-14 days) he didn't have the lights on and was very reluctant to switch them on when I said I wasn't comfortable with sitting in absolute darkness trying to have a nice evening.
He keeps saying that his eyesight is so good that he doesn't need lights and I know its a part of his diagnosis to be very sensitive to light and brightness.
So I guess i seek answer and advice on two questions:

1. Is it necessarily bad to not have the lights on? (I live in Scandinavia and its really dark here this time of year) 

2. If its bad for him should I try to push/hint at him that it isnt good? Or let him sit in the darkness since he claims that whats best for him.

I would be very thankful for any ideas/suggestions on this, so thanks in advance.

85,"Hi,

So I don't even know if this is the right sub to ask this kind of thing, but here goes.

So I've always be kind of different from everybody that I know.

I'm have a complete lack of sympathy as well as empathy for basically anybody. With rare exceptions (my ex and best friend). Not even family really means anything to me.

If some terrible tragedy happened somewhere, I feel that it didn't affect my life in anyway, and as such why should it bother me?

I can watch as many gore videos as anybody can find and show me, I'm mostly pretty un-reactive to that type of stuff no shock, no disgust. Nothing. but now and then when I do react, its with pleasure, I find it funny or interesting.

My grandmother died a few years back, and my grandfather has been diagnosed with prostate cancer recently, and it just doesn't seem to have any effect on me. I could care less.

But a few days ago, my gf left me, after I found out that she and my best friend have developed feelings for each other. This broke me. I started feelings more emotion than I ever have, and I just can't understand why.

I'm usually so numb, hell usually I enjoy pain (physical as well as emotional), but now this I just can't deal with.

Any ideas as to why I am this way? Is it normal, or is there actually something wrong with me?",04Mar2019,1

100,"So Im just really starting my journey here on mental health checking myself after having a conversation with a friend of mine at work. Its come to my attention that I really have no passion towards pretty much anything. I wake up and just go through the motions and then go to sleep. I have no passion for really doing anything, the only thing that drives me to get up in the morning and finish my day is just because I know I have to.

&amp;#x200B;

Just going to say this is probably going to get a little dark but Im sorry its how I feel, Im 30, married, just had a kid recently and honestly the only reason I get up and go to work is because I have to pay bills, the only reason I feed and change diapers is because its required of me to do so as a parent and take care of the child, the only reason I talk to my wife and go out of my way to take care of her is because its what a husband should do...none of these things I really want to do but I do them just because its what a man should do. I have no drive or passion to do any of it or anything really, Im just here, Im present and just basically going down a check list of things each day to say theyre done. 

&amp;#x200B;

Im not sure where Im going with this but writing this and reading this outloud this cant be the thoughts of a normal person right? Somewhere in this text says something like yea this person needs help? and what kind of help he needs? I personally dont feel bad, I dont feel like out of place, I physically feel fine or just feel nothing or anything I just feel like I exist and thats it. After talking with my friend I can acknowledge that I do lack feelings for others, if someone was to get hurt in front of me it just doesnt phase me, but on the flip side Ive had the postpartum of childbirth (if men can have that) and randomly think of losing my child and that makes me tear up a bit, that feels normal.

I’ve just hit the wall with stress. It’s started to effect me to the point that I’m having a physical reaction. Chest pains and shallow breaths and moments of exhaustion. Since my dad died of cancer in 2017 I’ve realised my own mortality.  I then started to convince myself I have all sorts of illnesses and blown every little pain out of proportion. Mainly convincing myself I have cancer. I also think it’s effecting my memory.

My boyfriend left his job due to getting into a crowd involved with crystal meth and random sex parties after I broke up with him.  We got over it and he got back to a better place after I sat him down and worked us through it. I’ve had to support us both in a pretty expensive part of the world. He’s in a better more stable place now. I signed him up for therapy which has been amazing for him.

I’ve zero mates and even those people I know I still feel the need to put on this face of everything is alright.  It feels like they genuinely wouldn’t care or think I’m just being an idiot. I get the whole it’s ok not be ok thing but it’s so hard to trust people with that. That’s why I generally don’t trust a lot of people and also probably don’t have anyone in my life I can just be honest with. When I talk to my boyfriend I feel like he is judging rather than just listening. That isn’t his fault though I know he is trying to help.

When it comes to sharing how I feel, stress and emotion are like the most private things and I just find it so difficult to explain what I mean. This is where I start to really judge myself as not being this perfect person. (I was the golden child growing up so guess where that came from...). That whole feeling of just not making the grade becomes a vicious cycle that you just keep telling yourself you aren’t good enough. Last night I got only a couple of hours sleep after laying in bed having the most incredibly random thoughts to point I actually did wonder was I going mad.

I flew to Madrid for Work today to launch a new training scheme for the first time. At the end I did an exercise where I asked everyone, anonymously, to mark it out of 10. Write what you loved and then write what could have been better. Out of the 6 people I got 4 ‘9’s and 2 ‘10’s. I thought I was rubbish and they all thought I was awful at the training course. (It’s a brand new job). The scores were a good pick me up though but then I automatically think they were just being nice.

To sum it up I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder with psychotic tenancies and ADHD 2 years ago. I am on a concoction of drugs which have changed me for the better (not suicidal) but also worse.

Without listing a 2 year story I'm just here for any type of help. I literally don't know where else to go. My head is crying ""help"". My mum is worried but isn't understanding. If I were to tell her what I tell my psych she'd partially die inside. My dad calls my ritalin 'speed' and has not taken my whole mental health problem seriously as he is from the ""just get on with it"" generation. 

I have told 2 close work friends and they pull me straight out of any slump when I see them. Very grateful for them. Was on the verge of a panic attack for god knows why, but talking to them prevented it. 

I have been with my girlfriend for over a year now and I have only told her about the ADHD. I planned on opening up over time but I became scared of how she would react after getting to know her. She has the most beautiful heart but me opening up would be such a burden on her and I don't want to rely on her to keep me on track. I feel it would damage our good relationship. It only gets harder now to tell her as time goes on. 

I have had many relapses in my psychotic side when trying to reduce the dose, so we just keep it stable now. My frustration is I was never actually psychotic before the medication. I had a few moments of 'psychotic tendancies' which did scare me, but now when I relapse I have had full body paralysis halfway through my shift literally fighting with my body to move an inch, which magically went away the moment someone could see me. 

At one stage my psych suggested putting me in a psych ward but the idea of it and people finding out made me opt for the heavier antipsych drug. 

2 days ago everything just caved in. Things to do, uni.... wait that's it? I literally don't have much to do every day, yet I don't do it. It's worse than ever, to the point where I'm asking; 

**What can I do to ground myself?**

By that I mean, when I realise I'm doing something I shouldn't be, what can I do to snap myself out of it? Words don't help, my brain has learnt to tune out all useful knowledge when I'm doing something I shouldn't be.......

Ok im done. This post is too long, yet there's so much more going on and I'm probably painting a wrong or half finished picture here of myself. 

I'm honestly considering a psych ward. I need a reset. Even if it's small.

However, even though she’s told me over and over again that she chose me and she wouldn’t mess around, my mind still goes to dark places. I’ve tried to take things in a positive direction, I treat myself to something nice or I try to hang out with my friends when she’s out with them, and most of the time, It certainly lessens the blow. 
I recognize that I don’t have a problem with her girlfriends, but there’s always a twinge of jealousy that revolves into almost panic whenever they’re male. I love my wife and I really don’t think she’d do anything to hurt us,and before I do anything drastic, I need to get my own feelings under control, because I recognize that what I’m anxious or catastrophizing about is not necessarily reality. 
Does anyone have any advice for me to help me get a better handle on my jealousy? I would greatly appreciate any advice you can provide! Thanks!!!",04Mar2019,1
116,"Hello, I hope your day is day going as of today mine is better too.
My cry for help.
I recently lost a friend all over a sudden. At first I seemed fine and everything was going ok. I was the stronger one in most cases then the funeral and you know I still did not feel any heavy emotions, but as time goes on you start missing them, thus I burying  myself in work and keeping busy and then feelings would come and go but eventually that did not work. I was always tired from working 90-95 hours a week plus 13 hours of commute too. I was just burning out and with luck of sleep came stress and then the depression, grief and lack of sleep accompanied it. Then instead of taking it slow, I started the occasional 2 drinks before bed or wine. At first it was harmless, but as time went on so did the alcohol dependency.
My number of drinks increased and as long as I was still waking up and making work on time I did not see any problem, and then on my days off I would wake up to jack and coke( between 5.30-9am) get my buzz. Around this time, my depression was just getting dark, I would wake up sit in my bed blinds down and just start thinking dark thoughts, i mean really dark  but then when I was around people I was the same person nothing wrong, happy, jolly, bubbly but at night it was me and my straight liquor, watching some murder show on netflix and really contemplating suicide and maybe trying a stronger drug. 
Soon after, I slowly started disconnecting from the world, heavily drinking still, and as my  depression got worse I was not attentive at work, church or anything I did not care as long as I had my whiskey, I started missing work because I would wake up and just sit in my bed, and overwhelming sadness would cover my soul, I just could not get out of the spot. Not even communicate with anyone. Those who wanted to see me would either get lucky and find me home tipsy or at the bar. 
I started losing sight of who i was so i decided to talk to the closest person one can share their problems with, mom.
First of all in the African culture there is hardly interaction with kids let alone how you feel but since I thought I am older now maybe we can engage in a conversation. I remember vividly  telling my mum I had problems but am not sure if I am comfortable telling you. Instead of asking me what was wrong or how could she help, I remember her screaming at me in the loudest of voices, “what do you mean you have problems, what problems can you have? You have  no kids and are living in America stop complaining and be grateful because if you were still in Africa right now you would have problems.” This was not the first time I had heard this speech, everytime I mentioned a hardship she would either say this or laugh in my face, before I would just shrug it off and be strong. This day was different those words hit my ear differently, all I could do was burst in tears and told my mum, “I am depressed and stressed”,  people when I tell you African parents are ruthless; she neither hugged me, no gave me a tissue but instead found it extremely amusing to her that she burst out laughing saying ""what do you mean you have depression? You have only been here a few years and now you think you are American.” I HAVE NEVER FELT ALONE IN MY LIFE than I did in that moment and then she went on to say I am just making up excuses and that we African people do not get depression or anxiety. She continued on to tell me that if I have time to be depressed I have time to find a part time job (had 1) . I remember me standing there tears down, all I had come for was for someone to tell me it will get better or I mattered, something to help me but instead I left her house feeling at my worst and embarrassed, for not only did she laugh in my face but had the audacity to tell the rest of the family and them joking about it in the group chat. The drive home was brutal. I did not know if to crash end it right there or just go get some nyquil. I was just thinking what would take me out faster.
Eventually, I started not to care. Have a drink in my tea cup at work (mind y’all I work with people how dangerous in hospital setting 😬😬😬). I started missing church, being late for activities or events, being hungover almost every other day, and finally just not leaving my house at all but everytime my mum called I would tell her “am fine” because that was easier. I didn't even tell her i left my job or quit tbh I do not know because I stopped showing up, I just did not have it in me to be fake smiling for 8-10 hours knowing it is total darkness inside, also I thank God because no one ever caught on my “tea”, or did not harm anyone in the process.
As of now I started receiving help, volunteering and reading also 
helped me a lot. I have been in therapy for the last 3 weeks and it is helping. I have asked my mum to join me in these at least once and hear from a professional but she told me she does not have problems but then again I have seen her drink half a liter of Johnnie Walker every other day, can drink 12 bottles of wine in 3 days but yeah, she doesn't have any problems. There is reasons we self medicate, she just says she is a strong woman and can take anything life throws at her.
Every African child I know or talk too has gone through the same experience if not worse. We get so much mental and emotional abuse we do not even realise it. Once in a while my even siblings and cousins will laugh at me, but I just pray for them and encourage them too to go get help before it is to late. All I can do is plant a seed. 
As I write here today at 3.12am looking at my Court ordered Eviction hearing, I find myself yet again in the same position and I am doing so well I can not drink now. No one to talk to because if you think my mum is not nice now, hahaha….it would be the end of me if she found out I am getting evicted because I choose to give up work to get help and NO SHE WILL STILL NOT HELP ME IN ANYWAY even staying at her house. Last night I was blaming myself again (had I stayed working i wouldn't be in here, but then my therapy self is telling me at what cost because I would have kept routine and kept drinking but i think it would have cost me down the road, probably like a DUI or have a stink on my Certification)
I scraped up some money for this month rent but got my car impounded 2 weeks ago and used it for that. I am currently please seeking your assistance  in anyway and would greatly appreciate it. As I do not know what to do atm. 
I am also seeking helping me start an online support group for my fellow Africans hurting my intention is for it to be able to reach not only western civilized countries, also Africa so we can connect and help break the cycle. Anything really would help( web developers, advice, donations of knowledge: books, articles etc., volunteers anything really, personal stories, self help steps etc.)because I know I am not the only one suffering. I would like to set up a website for that and even corders can help to, therapists who can offer their time etc. Our African and Black communities are drowning in Mental health problems, and their self help Hennessy.

Are waiting lists usually this long?

118,"Hey r/mentalhealth, F27 in the US here. Long post incoming about the wild ride I’m currently on trying to diagnose my mental health struggles, but with a TLDR at the end! Mostly, though, I’m explaining this because I’d love to hear your thoughts on the question I asked in the title.

So, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and generalized anxiety as a teenager. Family history of bipolar, all seemed to make sense, so I never really questioned it. I sought out medication for the first time in my mid 20s. Lamictal has been a godsend for minimizing the bipolar symptoms. However, I’ve never been able to shake the anxiety and all its effects, especially on my energy and inability to focus/remember/think through complicated things. I’ve been trying different medication combos and therapy and self-help and just… nothing. 

My psychiatrist has been trying several strategies for years now, but we just went back to the drawing board and she prescribed me… Adderall and Guanfacine? Which are typically used for ADD/ADHD treatment. She said she doesn’t think I have ADD/ADHD… But also kept saying this should help treat my “ADD/ADHD-like symptoms.” She’s brought this up a few times before now. 

Coincidentally, I have a friend who just had her chronic depression and anxiety re-diagnosed as (drumroll…) ADHD. She was describing her symptoms and how they had gotten misdiagnosed, and not all of them hit home… But lots of them **really** did. 

I also just started seeing a new therapist, and she is the first person I’ve ever opened up to about my childhood… and she thinks I may have CPTSD. Apparently bipolar is a common misdiagnosis for CPTSD. So do I have that instead of bipolar? In addition to? No idea yet, but now we’re exploring that possibility. 

Since that wasn’t enough, my psychiatrist also thinks I might be hypothyroid. My levels of thyroid hormone are *technically* just on the edge of the normal range, so my primary care doctor wouldn’t treat me for it, but many of the hypothyroid symptoms fit with what I’ve been experiencing. My psychiatrist started me on the lowest dose of levothyroxine, and it helped my energy level, but didn’t address everything. She doesn’t want to go up any higher on the dose, though, since my levels are still technically normal and she doesn’t want me to go hyperthyroid.

On top of it all, I have no idea how much of this is coming from my extremely stressful work environment. I am getting my PhD in Chemistry, and am currently six months away from graduation, finishing up my research and trying to write a thesis. I’ve been sexually harassed and bullied in my time here, in addition to it just being a very high-pressure environment and not something I actually enjoy or am passionate about. 

This has been going on for so long now, and I am totally overwhelmed and unsure how to cope. I feel like I’m on a roller coaster trying new medications, unsure how any of them will affect me. I don’t even know what to research or try anymore. 

**TLDR: Docs unsure what combination of bipolar, generalized anxiety, ADD/ADHD, CPTSD, hypothyroidism, or chronic stress I have and I’m just AAAAHHHHHHH**

Now, I know none of you are doctors who can sort out these diagnoses for me, but I wanted to ask y’all: How have you dealt with uncertain or changing diagnoses you’ve received? Do you have good strategies for keeping track of your symptoms or the effects of meds you’re trying? Any advice for someone in this situation or maybe some hopeful stories about going through a time like this and coming out on the other side? ",04Mar2019,1

120,"Intrusive thoughts attach themselves to memories. It's hard to enjoy anything, as sometimes, even for months straight, this happens. Not sure if it's something OCD related but I'm pretty sure it is.

Whether it be during an important moment in a movie or video game, or while reading, my mind jumps to something horrible (Usually because sometimes I'm actively trying to avoid it).  Sometimes a character reminds me of someone who annoys me for a split second. Then, whenever I see or read that scene again any time again after that, my mind instantly jumps to what was in my head while I experienced it. Either the horrible thing, the person who annoys me, or anything else. It triggers what I had in my head rather than focusing on what happened instead.

It can ruin things for me often. I try to think back on meaningful moments in my favorite pieces of media but my mind jumps to something horrible I was thinking about that is forever attached to it. 

It just drives me crazy sometimes. I just want to enjoy things but I can't get this shit out of my head.

121,"I honestly don't know if any of this is going to make any sense but I've bored absolutely everyone I know about this and right now I just need to scream about this.

There has been a situation I got myself in that has effected my mental health really badly for the last two and a bit years. It started off without me really realizing and grew into something just ridiculous last year, I promised myself this year I would move on and started to try and beat the bad habits I had that dragged me down all the time and had completely stopped doing them throughout the entirety of February just to go back to my old ways today and find myself not only hating myself more then I already did but just wishing I could disappear completely.

The problem is stupid so I won't bore you all with it but I don't like the person I've become in the last two years and because of other people knowing I have very bad anxiety and seeing the drama they could cause stirring the pot I've basically been made to look like a complete psychopath to some people so I can't in any way change the situation into a more favourable one for me. I can't really leave it at the moment because I can't afford too so I just have to try and get over it.

I can't though. I've tried so hard but every time I think I'm making progress it is like my brain just wants me to be upset. I don't blame people for thinking I'm mad because I am pretty sure I'm going mad. I just don't know what to do, I thought I had broken the habits and that I was on my way out of caring about this whole thing and felt so much better for it. Last week I went out with a bunch of work friends on Monday and was on cloud 9 all week until the problem reared its horrible head and my weekend was just awful and then today I turned back to the old habits kind of knowing that doing it was just going to make me worse.

I'm not sure why I want to talk about it, I know I'm not making any sense I'm just so lost. My friends don't understand, these things are easy to them and they don't see the problem my anxiety and depression give me when trying to act ""normal"" to solve all this. Every time I tried I made it worse and it is like my brain is hardwired to make the situation explode at any opportunity it is given. I'm tired and this weekend has drained me of my absolute last bit of energy to fight any of this. I'm just lost. It is all so stupid but even though I can see that I can't stop it and I don't know what to do anymore.

I haven't been doing well in school (not passing) and I am taking coursework that if I fail, I'll have to probably drop out of my major. Was thinking about taking a quarter off of school but my upper div coursework is only offered once a year and is offered in a series so I'll have to wait another year to take it and I don't have the money to stay another year. I keep worrying about so many things that I am not able to fall asleep for half an hour to an hour when I do get the chance to fall asleep. When I'm done taking a test, I literally will think about my test and even when I fall asleep, I think about filling in my answers (which I realize later are all wrong) and am unable to do anything about it. When I am awake, my mind doesn't focus and I often forget everything after \~ 2 hours. When I study for a test, even though I studied for about one to two weeks prior to the exam, right before as I am reviewing, I notice that I start mixing up and forgetting information. Everyone tells me that I am in a toxic work environment and that I need to get out. I've been constantly thinking about wanting to commit suicide and I am so devastated by my grades. I feel so stressed out and have been having a lot of chest pains and numbness and tingling in my extremities (am prediabetic). I know that I should just get sleep, but it's hard to fall asleep and by the time I finish my work, I won't get that 7-8 hours of sleep (usually get from 2-5 hrs each night and always in intervals of about 2 hours). I've stopped dreaming and when I wake up, I feel so tired. I've been thinking more and more about suicide and am not sure what to do. On the waitlist to see if I could meet with a therapist or psychiatrist but my thoughts seem to focus more and more on suicide and I'm not sure if I'll last until then.

Have been diagnosed with depression, insomnia and anxiety. Not taking medication because when prescribed different medications, they didn't work out and am too scared to try new medications which work/don't work. When I was on medication, I ended up not caring, randomly falling asleep sometimes, and almost fell asleep during one of my finals in one quarter and not turning in any assignments for 1/3 of another quarter (can predict how that went).

I started having really messed up thoughts until finally I just could not breath and went into a panic attack. It went away somewhat fast because I forced myself to breath and calm down, but that feeling of uneasiness stayed for the rest of the day.

I was getting my life together, being responsible, working nearly full time and going to school. I got arrested right before Christmas for a DUI, possession of weed, and for having a fake ID. 

I’ve been going to substance abuse counseling for the past 4 weeks, and I had over 60 days of sobriety. I don’t consider myself an addict, but that’s what everyone keeps telling me that I am. I have court coming up in about a week and I’m scared. My birthday was last week and I had a couple drinks, for the first time in awhile. It was my 21st birthday so of course I’m gonna have a few drinks with my parents at dinner. Fuck the system for making me feel bad for this. I’m 21 years old and in college everyone I know my age drinks and smokes regularly. 

I had to email my professor telling him hey, sorry can’t make it for the midterm because I have court that day ooops my bad. I’ve had a lot of sleepless nights and have worried about my situation and also felt a lot of anger, guilt, and frustrated. I’m angry at myself for putting myself in that stupid situation of getting arrested. I’m angry at myself for drinking and driving. I’m angry at the cop because I got pulled over for a dumb reason and I wasn’t even that drunk, I blew a .10 and I did really well on the sobriety tests. I wasn’t driving erratically or speeding or swerving or anything crazy, but I shouldn’t have been drinking and driving at all so I don’t really have a valid reason to be angry at the cop because he was just doing his job but no, I’m still angry.

I’m frustrated at the system, I’m going to be labeled a criminal for my life and with the fake ID charge it will be next to impossible to get into a career field that I wanted to do. I’m labeled an addict because I made one stupid mistake and now I have to do this ridiculous 16 week substance abuse class. I have to pay for everything myself and I’m already up to debt. I wanna die. I think about killing myself often because I feel like I really messed up. I feel bad for drinking on my birthday even though it’s something that everybody does on their 21st birthday.

\~ A little about me :

I am 16 , I love science and math .  
But recently I am getting very unfocused  
I am not able to commit to anything that I start.  
And I have create fictional characters in my mind

\~ The Story :  
As a kid , I used to imagine fantasies of warriors , super heroes and soldiers.  
The protagonist would be perfect in every aspect of life and would be involved in violence.  
These fantasies date back to when I was around 6.  
Since then I created numerous stories in my head.  
These stories ranged from a young brave prince to a rich pop singer.  
But most of my stories had three things in common - Violence , Money , Girls  
When I entered my teen years , the stories became much more realistic , creative .  
I created a fictional crime organization in my head which was run by a very smart criminal in the 80s .  
Lets compare this character to Tommy Vercetti from GTA Vice City.  
He had been the most wanted criminal for decades but lives a secret life as another person who runs a successful real estate firm and earn billions.   
This character has a big family and his sons who now control the crime organization of their father.   
These people lives life as a billionaire  , drive hyper cars , own gold rolex and stuff like that.  
But they have a secret dark life as well.  
They smuggle cocaine , illegal weapons , etc.  
The protagonist is tall , good looking , skilled in every form of martial arts , can kill everyone in the room .  
Games like GTA 5  , movies like John Wick , Bourne series give me a stimulation.  
I can experience the life of this character.  
Often , this character build relationship with female figures .  
The girl with which he is in relationship with has to be extremely good looking , good body , etc.  
I also add imperfection to the life of this character to make the story more realistic , like death of a loved one , failures .  
I also relate this character to my real life.  
If I had a bad day , that character would also have a bad day.  
I have spent days sitting and creating this story.  
And this is 'one' of my many stories.  


\~ The Problem :  
As I already mentioned I have lack of focus as I am always dreaming and imagining about this character  
I have thought of writing my stories ( I am a decent writer) , but I don't do it because I have other priorities like studying science and math which i don""t do ultimately.  
I have recently started NoFap movement which promotes abstaining from Porn , Masturbation and Orgasm.  
NoFap has changed my life very much since i started 3 months ago.  
But I keep relapsing because I would fantasize my character having sexual encounter and end up breaking my streaks ( NoFap streaks)  
I don't know if this kind of imagination is positive or not . Because when ever I imagine these stories I feel satisfied or good. This is bad as that feeling of satisfaction is the dopamine rush in my body which is a reward system. And by feeling satisfied just by imagining stories , I am hacking the reward system in human body.  


\~ What I plan on doing :  
I plan on cutting my screen time  
Start Meditating   
Exercising more  
Keep myself occupied all the time  


\~ Reason I am reaching out to you guy :  
I wanna know what I am doing is common or not  
Is it dangerous or not  
How to use my imagination  


Also:  
The stories that I imagine are much better and creative than what I wrote above.  
I am afraid my ideas could be copied so I kept the stories very short and brief.",04Mar2019,2

I believe most of our big mental health problems stem from a sense of shame, this idea that somehow something is wrong with us. I think shame looks different for different people; we all have different experiences and as such have different perspectives, but I think that if you really dive deep into people’s psychological difficulties, you’ll find a shared sense that something is wrong with them as an individual. This could manifest itself in a belief that you’ll never be enough for the people that you care about, or a belief that you will never be able to be truly happy, or even a belief that you just aren’t capable of functioning as a normal member of society. Whatever belief that shame manifests in, it feels absolutely terrible. The worst part is at a certain point we realize its other people that made us feel this way. I can’t speak for everyone, but I don’t believe I was born with the same sense of shame I have now. Other people throughout my childhood and teenage years did things that made me feel this way, and upon my first realization of that idea I decided I just would stop caring about other people. If other people made me feel shame then other people must be the problem, so if I just stop caring about them then I’ll be able to be that same happy I was when I was a kid. Eventually though, I realized this didn’t work. I wasn’t as unhappy as I’d once been, but I’d become someone that wasn’t me in an effort to protect myself from the world. I’d lost my sense of self because I was too worried about someone else taking it away from me.

I think cutting other people out and trying to not care about them is universal to people who feel shame. The people we choose to cut out varies, as again we all have had different experiences so we are willing/unwilling to share our shame with different people based on our past. The other part of this that varies is the way we cut people out. I think shame stems from various relationship dynamics, and so we avoid whatever the dynamic was that made us feel that certain way. Whether it be a parent, peers, or something else, we avoid dynamics that remind us of the one that gives us our shame. While this seems logical, this is actually where we all end up really fucked. It sucks, but the reality is that you’re only ever going to be happy when you start opening yourself up to shame again. We find joy by sharing our experiences with people who can understand us, and if you’re someone who has dealt with shame your whole life, how can someone that hasn’t had the same experience possibly understand you. How can you find joy again without ever letting yourself be truly understood?

Shame makes you find a means for ignoring it, because to be constantly facing shame is horrible. For people who don’t experience shame until later in their life this is less of a problem, as hopefully when you’re older you have greater perspective and more advanced social skills, so its easier for you to understand how you’re feeling and what actions you can take to deal with that shame that won’t hurt you or other people. When someone starts experiencing shame at a young age, we don’t have those same perspectives and abilities so we often find an unhealthy way to avoid it. This could be avoidance, lashing out, or, and what I think happens most often, committing yourself to something that doesn’t really matter in order to distract yourself from your shame. If we can’t convince ourselves we’re enough, we settle for finding ways to convince ourselves we’re better than someone else in a way that does not really matter. Whether it be being a better athlete, gamer, or student, we find a new way to define ourselves that let us be better than someone else. 

These unhealthy ways for avoiding shame get engrained in our psyche, and it becomes the only way we know for dealing with it. This ends up doing tremendous damage to us down the road, as we find ourselves hurting other people in our own attempts to avoid shame. We feel shame so we look to find someone that can understand us, the only people that can understand us can also make us feel shame, so we use our old unhealthy means for dealing with shame and end up hurting the person we thought could understand us. The only way to escape this dynamic is realizing that shame is at the root of these decisions, and being willing to accept that you’re going to have to deal with it, otherwise we destroy ourselves in a desperate attempt to avoid it. 

The reality is that once we feel shame, we stop caring about making ourselves into something better than what we once were, and start caring only about being better than someone else. As time progresses, less and less people are willing to keep putting up with our need to be better than them, until the only people left to make yourself better than are the people that genuinely care about you, and the people who need you around because they’re doing the exact same thing to you that you’re doing o them. It’s tough to know the difference between the two, and sadly I think that the people who genuinely care become unwilling to keep putting up with one’s deflections of shame because getting hurt by someone is much worse when you actually care about them. The people who simply need you because they are also avoiding shame are more likely to stick around, because they won’t actually be hurt when you wrong them to avoid shame. 

I think the only way we can healthily deal with shame is by acknowledging it, because until we do, we are stuck hurting the people we don’t want to, and end up surrounded by people that are there for their own selfish reasons, not because they actually care about you. In order to find out who we truly are, and to regain the same sense of self that existed in our past, I think we need to accept the unfortunate realities of our existence and use them as points of connection, not something to separate us from the world.",04Mar2019,1

139,"My dad's a really good guy but he's been struggling with heroin addiction for years, he got pulled over for speeding Saturday night at 11 but in the state of Kansas if they smell drugs on you they can search the car. Instantly my dad gave them the weed but they still searched the car and found heroin. The last thing I said to him in a few days was just I love you before I watched him get driven away in a police car. While I was crying another copy came over and led me to his car. He went out of the car to take care of some stuff. While he was gone I noticed my dad's girlfriend who I will be referring to as female dog in the back of the car, I asked her if she knew and she said yes she did, I instantly got mad and yelled at her for not telling me before being silent. we drove to the police station, they took female dog in first and she looked back at me and I had the biggest smile on my face as I flipped her off from in the car since I hated her. I never actually knew my dad was using heroin until this incident. Inside the police station I had to wait there for 6 hours. I did nothing for the first 3 and watched sponge Bob for the other 3. A cop came and got me and drove me through the night to a temporary foster home. I stayed a day there constantly texting and calling my mom because I was scared for my dad. Every hour I texted our roommate to make sure that Fatima (my dog) was fed and let out. finally I got to leave. We drove to the court and I was so excited to finally see my mother. My mom wasn't there it was only my grandma. since my mom has a 4 month old child and she can't drive from new Mexico to Kansas. My dad walked into the room in a orange jumpsuit with his hair a mess, like a chimp tried to eat bugs out of his hair. He looked super sad and instantly I started balling my eyes out because first off I'm 12 years old and love my dad, dog and mom more than anything in the world, and second whenever my dad is sad I instantly start crying since I've only seen him sad once before this. The trial starts and they say a bunch of stuff I don't understand, but in the end I'm staying with my grandma. Right now my grandma's doing the paperwork to take me home. I just need some mental support during this time. I also still think that my dad's girlfriend is a complete female dog for reasons I will not explain and the heroin thing.",04Mar2019,6

141,"I’m just tired, my body is tired, emotionally I’m tired; I’m just tired of not feeling happy.
Don’t get me wrong I do feel happy sometimes but it’s like having a cup of tea but you forget the sugar! 

I get these days where I’m so motivated, but then I have days I’m like trying to grab onto things for happiness when in reality I should be happy within myself!

I haven’t felt this down in a long time. I’ve had my bad days but today is horrible. Just plain fucking awful. 

I feel like a weight is holding me down or I’m underwater and trying to walk but literally cannot move. 

I’m a full time student at the minute and I had to take time off work to sort shit out and concentrate on school stuff and yeah tbh it worked I did well in my exams etc however.. now I’m like if I go back to work will my grades be impacted?, will I feel even more overwhelmed but I need the money?, do just not go back or do I find a job that has a passion within it?

Essentially today is a bad day and I’m struggling to see any hope.

142,"This has being happening consistently for two weeks now, every night I wake up at random hours ranging from 3-6ish.

The first week was just that but this week each time I wake it’s accompanied with a nightmare beforehand or just general auditory hallucinations the worst one was last night which triggered me to make this post I woke up to screams of someone being murdered upstairs whether I heard them while I was awake or heard them while I was asleep and only processed it when I awoke I’m not sure. This legitimately freaked me out while I could rationally tell myself it was nothing I couldn’t help but shake and lay in bed staying as still as possible “just in case” and I didn’t get any sleep for the rest of that night.

144,"Hey Guys,

Throwaway account because of reasons. I am currently a student at a top public university and it has gotten very tough. This is due to three main reasons:

1) Studies

2) Relationship

3) Parents accident (they survived)

I will go through my feelings one by one.

1) I am very lazy. After being accepted into the program of my liking, I have had no motivation. All my friends are doing great internships all around NY and SF while I am stuck at nothing. Got rejected from everywhere and have lost all motivation. I currently don’t go to a single class and am cooped up in my room 24/7 reading books/ watching movies/ doing art. I order my food online and go to the gym. I sleep about 13 hours a day at very odd times. I sometimes drink  till I pass out alone in my room. I don’t have any good friends here and know almost nobody at my school. I also hate parties and would call myself an introvert. I lay in my bed all day and don’t study. I have been getting Cs in all my classes and even failed twice last semester. I cannot get back up. Studies have been a burden. 

2) My girlfriend broke up with me because of a lot of reasons mentioned below. I get angry too quickly, I am extremely impulsive and stubborn, and apparently don’t empathize with other people. I am also apparently too selfish. She says that I lack basic communication skills and that I never understand her perspective. She says everything is always about me. She also says I always run from my problems rather than understanding them. She types essays on essays but I am too tired to read them. Even if I do read them, I do not understand what she is saying and I say ‘okay I understand you’. The only thing I know is I love her and want to be with her, even though I don’t understand more than half the things she talks about. She says she cannot teach me the basics but I keep urging her that I will improve and be better. But I have made zero progress on my own. I just don’t understand her feelings or emotions and don’t know what to do. But I would say I am a pretty emotional person. When I watch movies, if there is a very sad scene, I tend to cry a lot because I always imagine it happening to me. But I am pretty awkward with people and don’t try to be as emotional. I agree with some of the things she says but don’t know how to improve. 

Another major problem that I need a separate paragraph for is, I forget almost everything. If we argued about something two weeks ago, I don’t remember what it was about. I remember my finance and economics equations correctly but these arguments on the phone? Not at all. I sometimes forget complete events and how they went down. She once asked my a question about my ex and the time period. I told her what I remembered. I then remembered something more, and so I added in this information. This happened two more times. From her perspective, it looks like lying. But from mine, it’s genuinely forgetting and telling her as I am recollecting. This has happened numerous times along multiple occasions. I don’t know how to fix this either.

(More about this point expanded below if you want to read) 

3) My parents got into an accident and I saw the entire thing happen. They thankfully survived and are in a hospital. But, I keep replaying the incident in my head, recollecting all the blood and screams. I can’t seem to get it out of my head. I get really sad and depressed thinking about it all the time.

Overall, these are a summary to my feelings. I have never typed them out before and feel a bit better. I would love any advise on your end. 

Everything below this is more in detail of my emotions rather than a summary (if you want to read more) of point 2:
——————————————————————

My girlfriend says I get too angry. I think that is true. She also says I am impulsive, which is also true. Both of them combined make me hell to deal with. I keep switching back and forth from being nice with her to being an absolute asshole. For absolutely no reason (or due to a misunderstanding). She knows me best and we were best friends before dating. I love her with all my heart. I am so impulsive that it is having a very unhealthy effect on me. When I get the urge to do something, I rent a car for 60 bucks and go drive for a couple hours and come back. I shop online for expensive shoes and clothings. I bought an aquarium and all the supplies needed but stopped it the day after. I start something and never finish it. It’s for an instant joy to keep my mind off something. This is also where her argument of ‘you run away from your problems and never fix them’ comes in. I think I am so impulsive and do these things because I am running away from a problem. And it is an expensive habit that is not sustainable. I have applied this same principle to my relationship. If I am insecure about something, or have a problem with something, I run by getting mad and saying things I don’t mean. This then turns into me being selfish. Since I only care about my emotions. If I was not so impulsive, I would think about her feelings and act accordingly. 

**But I can’t seem to know what the appropriate emotional response to situations are.** This is one of my biggest problems. I don’t understand what is going through her head. If I think something is right, it is wrong. If i think something is wrong, it is right. I can’t match the feeling to the situation. So I am unable to understand her, which leads to more problems. It makes me seem selfish and not empathetic. I need help figuring this out. My girlfriend always says she cannot teach me the basics. But I don’t understand what they are and where to learn them. These problems are communication problems that are supposed to be easy to fix. They are also harder because this relationship is long distance. So tone in text is also always misinterpreted. I am not comfortable with calling her to talk most of the times and prefer text. This is because I am quite an introvert and do not say much in person or on call. So there are long awkward pauses. I literally stop thinking when I’m on call and it takes me effort to actually speak unless I’m making fake conversation. It’s hard to add meaning. So I prefer text. I think about what I should type. I type it out. I think again if it is alright. And then I hit send. I prefer that to everything else. Communication and understanding her feelings are a big problem that I have to fix.

This was my rant as of now. I will edit in more if required. Please let me know how to fix this and just be better. ",04Mar2019,1

146,"Idk if this is a form of self harm but at night I always go to bed later than I should or VERY LATE, like in the morning or something.

I need at least 7 or 8 hrs of sleep to function all day (evening included) or I am a zombie. 

School nights aside (which I go to bed too late anyway) when there is no school (I am in a private school rn and I don't have to go to class everyday) I go to bed always after 3 or 4 am. Sometimes I go to bed in the morning (after 5 or 6 am) without a real reason.
I barely get anything done. All I do is daydream (I have Maladaptive Daydreaming), listen to music, do random shit, go through my phone, try to do some HW etc but in most cases it is not because I am very busy.
It is totally pointless and it takes hrs of precious sleep, the next day I need to sleep until late in the afternoon to compensate.

Often in bed I need to daydream again for 2 or 3 hrs or it is hard to fall asleep...when I wake up I feel groggy or I get an headache sometimes.

When I attempt to go to bed earlier either I can't sleep because of daydreaming or not being able to relax or I wake up after 4 or 5 hrs.

What can I do to break this habit? I stay awake even if I am exausted and I have nothing to do..

147,"Hello, this is an alt account because my parents may have my main and I do not want to worry them. This is my very first text post in my two years of reddit so I'm sorry about the formatting. My name is Evan, I am 16 and suffered emotional and sometimes physical abuse from my father. This included:

Yelling at me for the most simple thing

Throwing me into a wall completely busted my upper lip and then him telling my mother it wasn't him but in fact me and my little sister ran into each other while playing

Grabbing my throat and lifting me up Darth Vader style in a fit of anger

And many many more things.

I constantly felt like I was walking around on eggshells in the presence of this man. I never knew when he was going to erupt. My parents finally divorced when I was in maybe 4-5-6th grade? I don't exactly remember. My parents told me the news and at first I was scared and hurt, but shortly after a strong feeling of relief came over me. I knew I wasn't supposed to feel that way but it was a feeling of a huge weight was lifted off of my shoulders. I cannot exactly pinpoint when I felt my mental health began to decline so I will jump into my symptoms.

I have a stepfather, he is the only one who I've ever considered my Dad. This man probably is the most important figure in my life. I look up to him in every way. I'm a teenager, I make mistakes, dumb mistakes, so naturally like every parent he gets mad at me and sometimes yells. I cannot stand it when a man yells. There have been many occasions where a Male teacher will get mad at another student and yell. That's when my anxiety skyrockets, it's like my brain is begging me to cover my ears and run. Is this a PTSD response? I do not know what it is that causes this. Next, my anxiety.

On occasions my anxiety has crippled me to the point of feelings of extreme dread. This feeling of this overencumbering weight pressing down on my heart. This has happened on so many occasions. And it only gets worse in the summer, without school to preoccupy my worries, I assume my brain decides to find whatever it can to worry about. My brain gets hung up on things that might not even be possible and just worries and worries and worries about them. And these are where my questions about depression come in.

What does depression feel like? My brain just constantly feels clouded to the point where concentration is quite hard. I wonder if I am depressed? Now for my questions on what to do.

My mother, a specialist in a field that is plagued with abused kids in every way possible. And the kids that do not make it out alive. Shes told me shes had anxiety like mine before. I've asked about medication and shes said that medication is simply a bandaid and does nothing to heal my mental scars. But doesn't a bandaid make the healing of a wound easier? Shes offered to sign me up for a therapist but I don't want to be a financial burden on my family. My mother has given me a book that illustrates what to do to rid yourself of anxiety. She said that she read that to help her recover after the divorce.

Well, what do I do? Would it be wise to get a psychological evaluation done? Maybe a therapist? I'm lost in a world that I will be forcibly thrown into when I turn 18. To start a new chapter. A chapter of adulthood. I want to get better before then.

I'm leaving out some details about my mental health so please, if you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask. Sorry if I've made a typo anywhere, typing on mobile. If something isn't clear please ask me. I need your help.",04Mar2019,4
148,"Anxiety is usually caused by low levels of GABA of Serotonin. Most likely GABA I believe.

150,"Hey all. I'm a highschool senior who has been struggling with a fear of ALS. I acknowledge that I have health anxiety, and have had fears like this in the past. This one feels different. It started with muscle facilitations. They came out of the blue. I wasn't fearing ALS before that. That's never happened before. Usually I'll see a disease and then the physical symptoms will set in. This time they came first which scared me. Of course I made the golden mistake, consulting Dr. Google. After I found out muscle facilitations were a symptom of ALS, my quality of life has rapidly deteriorated. The facillations are widespread, and now include some minor cramps.Also feel weaker, like i can't do things I normally could. Worrying about this has made me isolate, caused my grades to slip, and made me lose all of my motivation. Life seems pointless if I have ALS. It's hard to convince myself I don't have It when it really feels like I do. My mom doesn't want to take me to a GP as we don't have insurance and we can't really stomach the cost right now. I'm sure she'd budge if i told her I really need to consult a medical professional. I know this isn't a substitute for a therapist. I've been speaking to mine but it hasn't been enough. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thank you! Quick recap: The facilitationsare widespread, and somewhat intense. They don't prevent sleep or impact me too much. Some minor cramps here and there. When I press my lips to a glass there is some minor tremors but only when they're in a certain position. Feeling sorta weak. Can't tell if it's perceived or not. I've been looking for muscle waste but I can't tell if there is any. I know ALS is very rare especially at my age. But my brain won't listen to any kind of reasoning.",04Mar2019,1

152,"&amp;#x200B;

First off, I hope it's okay for me to post here, I just needed to talk about this. also it's taken me hours on how to word this because i simply forgot... and/or I've been thinking of other things... just now i was stuck on ""forgot"".

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr My brother pointed a few things out about me and we talked about them and myself. he says i should see someone to talk about it, but i think it's not important and can be delayed or ignored.

&amp;#x200B;

He says that i have a weird, maybe blank look while i'm pacing around the house, doing anything like making tea or even in the middle of a conversation. He also pointed out how i'm pretty forgetful. Some of his examples of me being forgetful are that I forget important dates, forget that i am cooking, or even to eat. 

There were more discussed but i feel it'd be too long.

&amp;#x200B;

I did my best to listen to him and after he was done talking, i explained that i get so... engrossed in thoughts that it's the only thing that's going on. How i do things but i'm not 100% there, i can see what i'm doing, but i'm thinking of something else. A sort of auto pilot, i guess.

I moved onto the topic of me forgetting and just said that's just a thing everyone does. Every now and then i have a sudden realization about my life, but i can never remember what it's about.

&amp;#x200B;

He's worried that i'll forget something important that could have an effect on my health or be in my thoughts while crossing the street. He wants me to speak to someone that could maybe help me with these and other stuff that aren't mentioned. 

I don't think i need help because in my mind, it's not too serious. it's just how things are with me. I will say that sometimes it's overwhelming having my head clouded with thoughts and not being 100%, but i calm down after a while. ",04Mar2019,1
153,"So I’m just going to leave my life’s story here for everyone. I might need serious help, I’m not sure.  

Lately I’ve been having something happen that concerns me where I mutter stuff out of nowhere, like I say things I didn’t mean to say. It never happens when I’m around people, only when I’m alone and I can stop if I catch myself. The stuff I say is usually weird and bad. Some specific stuff: “N-word” (And I’m not racist or anything), “Stupid, idiot. I could kill him.” “I hate him/I hate it.”,”I love you”,  “I could I would. I could and I will.“, and (this is actually real) I say stuff like “slice, dice, chop, tear” a lot. There are no conscious streams of thought connecting to these words. I don’t know why I say them. 

Another thing that’s been more recent is some particularly violent dreams. One where I basically kept tearing someone’s head off, it regrowing so I could do it again, and screaming at them because they had been trying to push me around. Another time I just kind of shot down a bunch of people who were ninjas or something, but I remember specifically in the dream they were supposed to be “good guys” and I just wanted to kill them. The most disturbing one, which I woke up from immediately because it was so disgusting, was where my youngest brother (Who I love and am proud of to put it out there) slipped on the sidewalk, and when I went to pick him up I asked if he was alright he said “No.” in a very vivid about-to-cry way and I was horrified to see that his entire face was embedded deeply with staples. The dream was so realistic and gory. I immediately started to freak out and tried to help him pull the staples out but then I woke up with one of those really scared “What the fuck was that” feelings. 
This is a recent thing that is pretty infrequent. And at first it was crazy to me because my first thought was: I’m not violent. I don’t fight people. I don’t want to fight anyone. I don’t want to kill anybody. But I started analyzing myself a bit more and I realized I may have been putting off, basically my whole life, some pretty fucked up stuff that’s happened to me and that I’ve done to other people. 
So I guess I’ll start with where I am now and then go backward. Currently I consider myself well-adjusted. I just graduated college with a degree in Finance, I have IT experience in the reserves, and I’m staying with some family in the city (I grew up in a small town) working part time stocking shelves while I look for something full time in finance/IT. I have some good friends, but none who live near me right now and none who I would open up to about this sort of thing. I’ve had one girlfriend a year ago (More on that later.) But other than that I don’t do very good with girls, I don’t have a girlfriend right now. I spend a LOT of time by myself. In college I was the same way. I used to get very lonely, every once in awhile I still do, but for the most part I’m fine with it. I spend a lot of time learning, at least recently. Now that I’m older suddenly I found out I have more ability to concentrate on things and absorb info. Since I’m out of college I have more time to learn whatever I enjoy, so for the first time I feel like I’m some sort of superhuman hopping across Wikipedia pages and tutorials. I like computer science, finance/economics, history, current events, anatomy and physiology, and whatever other subjects I stumble across. 
Now the unnormal stuff: Up until now I’ve liked to pretend this stuff just isn’t a part of me. I completely ignore it. So I work out a lot, which is something that I feel like really helps my emotional health over all. I work out roughly 2 hours a day 6 days a week, and I’m very proud of how I look and feel now. I started working out in high school because I got picked on and was rejected by girls, so at first it was really hate and envy that motivated me. I don’t necessarily feel that way now, but everytime I workout its still the same: I fantasize about a bonfire, or a party where there is a group of people from high school or college (Never the army, because I actually like people in the reserves and feel like I belong there.) And I take on and fight the biggest douchebag or multiple douchebags from whichever place and I just like stand there in my awesomeness. Sometimes It’s just that, sometimes I’m also rich and I have a “posse” or bodyguards who I don’t need. Sometimes I monologue basically about how I got to where I was and how the things I had overcome. Narcissistic and ridiculous I know. Like I said before, even though this scenario runs through my head at least 2 hours a day six days a week I just pretend like that’s normal. And if I don’t run that sort of fantasy through my head I can’t work out as effectively. 
The other thing is sexual. WARNING - NSFW ….. So when I had a girlfriend for a few months I’d have sex and it was fine. Normal sex, the weirdest we’d ever do is tie each other’s hands. She liked being spanked. So that was normal, and for the most part the relationship was normal. But for as long as a I can remember, even in high school, the only way I can orgasm when masturbating is through BDSM porn. Usually pretty intense stuff. I don’t like blood or cuts, but I like seeing physical pain. Usually a woman dominating a man. Over time it’s gotten darker. When I stop I just go about my life and I act normal, but now that I think about it it’s pretty odd to orgasm to the sounds of people screaming in pain. This has become normal for me. So when I at first thought “I don’t want to hurt anybody, what’s going on?” I started to analyze and realize “Oh, yeah. That stuff.” 

So how did it get this way? I guess I’ll go back to childhood. I was homeschooled until sixth grade. 5th/6th grade are I think when problems started at home. My dad was a serious alcoholic. He still is but he’s at least mellow. Back then he wasn’t. Some examples:
8th grade summer: This is the only time he ever hit me when I was being kind of shitty because I didn’t want to go dig a fucking ditch to find a leaking pipe. For context: We had all been digging that stupid ditch for days and couldn’t find anything. I knew he didn’t know what he was doing and the pipe probably wasn’t even on that side of the house. We never found that pipe but I wound up digging that ditch again. He was drunk midday, smacked me across the face. I cried and tried to kind of get at him and yelled “I’ll kill you. I hate you” and he just kind of forced me back in the chair and I think he realized he went too far, but he just said “You’re not big enough or strong enough yet.” …fuck that kind of explains a lot. I’m kind of starting to cry while I write this. 

Another time he showed up to one of my cross country meets, I think 9th grade, totally drunk out of his mind. Another time he hit my mom and she being an idiot made him drive us to church on a Wednesday night so she could have “couple’s therapy” and her jaw hurt so she claimed she couldn’t drive. He was drunk Mom. He was drunk. We were swerving all over across the road there were cars beeping at us going the wrong way, they were screaming at each other, my little brothers were in front of me crying and I just was in the very back seat trying to meditate or something. I just tried to stay calm. I feel like I was the only one in the car that realized what mortal peril we were in and I guess I was getting ready to die or something. The next morning, like every time something like that happened, we all pretended like it didn’t. 
Last one: One time he was wasted in the middle of the day. I was just in the bathroom on the toilet. He tried the knob and saw it was locked and a split second later he kicked the door in so hard it flew against the opposite wall so I was just sitting on the toilet freaked out. He just muttered “Oh thought it was locked.” I was shaking. Like what the fuck. I actually did keep a knife under my mattress at one point, to prepare for something crazy like that. Now my relationship with my dad now is pretty mellow, but we never really came to terms with any of that stuff. We act like it never happened. He won’t even admit he did most of it. In my family we do very poorly with emotions. My brothers and I are very close for instance but we can’t say I love you to one another. I have a hard time saying it to anyone but my Mom. 

So I went into public school in 6th grade because my dad was first starting to get worse and my mom and him would fight all the time, very loudly, and divorce was on the table (But it never happened…they’ve just slept in a separate room all this time) and my mom felt like she didn’t have the energy to homeschool anymore. So I went into school with absolutely no social skills at all. I was a stand out weirdo and I remember for stuff like gym class I would literally just stand there. I had no confidence. I couldn’t muster whatever it took to try to catch the ball, and I always felt like there was so much pressure to try to impressed the other kids and be good. So they weren’t very impressed by me. I walked around with my arms folded behind my back for some reason. I didn’t really understand the social suicide I was committing. I’d say the next six years were just a really slow stumbling through trying to understand other humans and particularly the kids my age. 
In 7th grade my Mom started to just “check out.” Because her mom died who she had had serious unresolved issues with. So she went into a really depressed state for a couple years, and I think that made things harder. 
In 9th grade there was a girl I became obsessed with. We had been friends awhile, so I let her know I had feelings for her. She had a boyfriend who was VERY important to her at the time. So that whole cliché played out, except for the part where I mercilessly ripped into her via SMS, calling her every name in the book and taunting her, then asked for forgiveness, then did it again, eventually admitted my BDSM fantasies to her even though she really didn’t want to hear it, stalked her, grabbed her butt without her permission, came to her house uninvited only not to be let in, etc. 
And I had an unrequited psychotic obsession with her pretty much through all of high school. But for the last two years of high school she had stopped responding to me at all. So I look back on that and I feel pretty terrible. And I know if she wanted to report me to the police she could have ruined my life entirely, but for some reason she never did, so that makes me feel double shitty. 
But that didn’t stop me from about eight other counts of butt/boob grabbing, verbal assault, and uncomfortable pressuring of other girls that wanted nothing to do with me. One was a teacher. For whatever reason nobody ever reported me. By tenth grade I had gotten good enough at pretending to be a good kid that everyone seemed to think I was. I guess. 
So I never really though anything of any of that until my National Guard active training, where we had SHARP briefings on sexual harassment and stuff. And everyone makes fun of those briefings because we see them so often but they really played on something in the pit of my stomach that told me: “You’ve actually put girls into those positions. You’ve done awful stuff.” 
So yeah. After that I went to college. I didn’t really like college anymore than high school. I thought the other people were stupid. I came to study finance because I was passionate about it, I watched college lectures on Corporate Finance in 9th grade ffs, so the other kids there who didn’t seem to know why they were there just didn’t impress me. So I spent a lot of time in my dorm room alone. There were entire weeks where I didn’t speak to anyone. At one point I met a cute girl, we’ll call her Karen. 
Karen was very sweet, Karen was a passionate libertarian, thinker, and studied economics. I met her at at an economics association meeting. She basically at one point obliterated an argument I was making so I immediately thought “I want here number.” I got it and we hit it off. It was the first time I had a very wholesome reciprocated friendship with a girl. Karen was smart but a little naïve, and came from a good home. I think the song “Uptown Girl” could be her theme song. Unfortunately, a friendship was all it was, because Karen had a boyfriend in her hometown in another state. And he was VERY important to her at the time. But she didn’t have any other friends same as me, so we hung out a lot. Like a lot, a lot. We went on walks, lunch dates, dinner dates, whatever. We really clicked. But then my feelings kept growing for her and it felt like a repeat of high school. She reciprocated some of those feelings, but it was still all about the boy back home. I knew how to control myself better by then but it was rough. I didn’t want to lose this valuable friend but I was also extremely attracted to her, and she kept putting me in that position because she was lonely too.   
Eventually the bad thing happened. I decided I was being played for a bitch. I couldn’t accept this insult to my pride. So I figured I’d take what I wanted the way I always had, but this time it wouldn’t be just a cheap thrill. We were in her dorm room and we were talking and I forced myself on her. It started with an attempt at a kiss, she resisted, so I basically just started to force her against me. She resisted lightly but didn’t say anything. But that was it, I couldn’t go through with what I was planning to do. So I let go and we had a really long awkward silence staring at each other across the room. It was weird because this was the first time a girl I tried to do something like this to actually liked me in some way so I could tell it was scary and confusing for her, and it actually was for me too. I think she knew what I almost did. I can’t remember how I left, but later we texted, made up, and pretty shortly after became friends again, and I just went along with it and didn’t try anything again after that. So that was also weird. I still had feelings for her, and I don’t know how it would have turned out but at some point she dropped out of school to go home. She hadn’t told me until the day she was leaving, which was a shock to me. I guess she was embarrassed. So I offered one more long walk and we did, and it was a really good time. I felt like I was being mature, doing everything right for once. And we hugged before she left and she said “I’ll see you” and I just said “You won’t. You’re leaving.” And she had this kind of weird look and so far I’ve never seen her again. I tried texting her once asking if she would want to meet up again sometime, but she cited her boyfriend and said she couldn’t do that. I didn’t reply, just deleted the number immediately and never found her again. 

When I had my first real girlfriend it lasted four months, and was a relatively normal relationship, I mean any actual relationship would seem normal relative to my sexually-tense friend zone. I met her in my national guard unit, but she was also a 29 year old stripper with 2 kids. I had frequented strip clubs and wasn’t afraid to date a stripper. Started casual then got more serious. But she turned out to be batshit insane. Compulsive liar…the lies aren’t even worth getting into they were just pointless. Stuff she made up to get attention, and I believed most of them. So she played me like a fiddle and I dumped her when she went on a trip to San Diego without me. Later she tried to claim she was pregnant and just made the whole thing uglier and stupider than it needed to be, but the whole relationship experience was pretty meh in general. 

So now I am where I am. I think I covered a lot of the important points. I’m not sure if I should be concerned or not. I think I’ve just been repressing everything for a very long time, at least since I stopped venting my anger by harassing women. I don’t express emotions usually, everything just rolls off my shoulders for the most part. A few times I just get randomly sad, especially when I’m drunk but it does happen when I’m sober: I’ll just go through fits of crying. Not for any reason. Like, it could be a perfectly normal day and then at night I’ll cry until I fall asleep. It doesn’t happen often, and when it does I just wake up the next morning like it didn’t happen at all. When people reach out to me for empathy I don’t have a response. When my Mom is crying to me about something I feel bad because I want to offer more support but I just feel incapable of it. I wouldn’t call myself “dead inside” because I have plenty of interest in the world around me and I’m not that bad with people anymore, but when it comes to genuine connections I’m pretty lost. I am very alone with my thoughts and feelings most of the time. I have some reddit forums I go to where I like the communities and I feel like a have a strong voice there, but not anywhere in real life. 
Really all I look forward to though is someday being extremely affluent and powerful, and just kind of rubbing in everyone’s face how great I am. Like some grand revenge on all the people who thought I was just some loser they could push around. If I let go of that fantasy I wouldn’t have much in life to be proud of, or much reason to get up in the morning. I try to learn and grow every day and keep myself focused which sounds really nice, but really it’s just because I have delusions of dominating people with power attained through knowledge. I always think it would be nice to live a modest life with a family, and sometimes I think about meeting a girl I actually like and respect like Karen but I haven’t met another one yet, and I feel pretty inhuman most of the time. Like I’ll have to put on a mask and pretend to be someone else to meet a Karen again, and maybe I’m too far gone to be happy that way. So I don’t think about relationships as much as I used too. I’ve partly given up. I feel completely fine each day, and feel like I’m building towards something, getting better all the time, but for all the wrong reasons. 
The only period in my life where I started to wake up to the idea that I needed a better philosophy was pretty recently at the tail end of college. So my whole life through the military and different internships I would save roughly 75% of the money I made (I also made a small profit going to college off full merit scholarship + military aid.) So I had, I think about $17,000 after a couple of years of playing the stock market and doing pretty well. I started looking into cryptocurrency and didn’t think too much of Bitcoin but got super into learning about Ethereum which uses the blockchain concept for a decentralized virtual machine, which turns out is kind of a really powerful thing. So in mid 2017 I shifted everything I had into Ethereum plus a couple other crypto platforms I thought had potential. I wound up making over $75,000 in the big crypto bubble. But I only ever cashed out $6000 to reward myself because I genuinely believed (and still do) that what I had invested in has a long way to go still. So, the market crashed and I now have lost all profits with some extra money to boot. My portfolio is only about $10,000 altogether now, not including my IRA which I never count because I wouldn’t touch it. 
So a few months ago I had gotten very depressed about that whole ordeal, and wasn’t sure what to do. I started meditating and just getting out of my own head more, going for walks without the fantasies. I kind of accepted my own mortality, the fact I might not ever achieve the things I want to, and humbled myself. It worked for a while but it didn’t stick. Now I feel fine about the whole thing, I’ve accepted the volatility of the market and I love keeping up on the new things happening in the field every day. But whether I someday have a really well paying career or start an amazing business or get rich on investments, which are all things I feel are totally possible it doesn’t really answer the question of what the hell I’m supposed to do with my funked up emotional well being. When I came here to write this I felt like I might be in danger of being the next big school shooter, but now I think I might be ok. I just wish I could connect with people IRL and I think maybe all the hate and anger would start to go away. 

This brain dump was really therapeutic though.

154,"When I was 2 years old, my mom took my newborn sister on a business trip for about a week while my dad took me to visit my granddad. I've always had pretty bad separation anxiety, so when my mom left without me I was miserable. I remember begging her in our kitchen to stay home. 

A couple days ago, I was talking to my mom and that memory came up again. I started bawling. I had had a pretty rough day, but even as I think about it now I have this really sinking sadness. I've been told by my mom and my friends that this isn't normal. This is true for pretty much every memory in which I felt some sort of strong emotion.

156,"I got back on anti-depressants (Zoloft to be specific) during October, while also taking Seroquel in December. To clarify, I take Zoloft for my MDD, and I take Seroquel for my manic episodes and suicidal ideation. The Zoloft was prescribed by my psychiatrist in easily 2 appointments of seeing her. The Seroquel was prescribed soon after by my doctor. 

Here’s the issue: my doctor doesn’t seem to know what to do at this point. After telling her that the Zoloft wasn’t giving me any positive effects after being on it for about 2-3 months, she took me off of it. What I’m confused at is there was no mention of upping the dose, which could of done the trick for the positive effects to happen (keep in mind I was on the initial dose of 50mg and it can go up to 200mg). I also mentioned that Seroquel wasn’t doing any good, as I was still getting manic episodes, major depression and suicidal ideation with somewhat intense side effects. Keep in mind that I was on and off of it because my Doc kept wanting to put me on it due to my concerning symptoms. I’m still taking Seroquel at the initial dose (50mg), she wanted to increase it to 150mg but not anymore because she now wants me to get lab tests done for my creatine levels, due to my complaints of inflammation in the muscles and joints from the side effects. She asked me if I still wanted to be on Seroquel because of it and other side effects but only if they go away after a few weeks I said (I’m yet to know this, only been on it for a week straight). 

She was going to prescribe prozac (another SSRI anti-depressant) but I have already taken that before and it wasn’t working well at 40mg (10mg initial dose). She also mentioned Wellbutrin but said that it’s not suitable for my age group (I will be 18 in 1 month anyways and it’s normally for people 18 and up). At one point she asked me what SSRI I wanted to be on but all of the ones I’ve been prescribed were the ones I knew (because they are the most commonly prescribed by docs). A week from now I will get results from the lab and I will determine if Seroquel is in favour because it’s not really doing much for me. At this point, I feel kinda disappointed in my doctor because she could of increased my Zoloft to a higher dose, as well as put me on Lithium for bipolar symptoms. The only reason she didn’t continue my Zoloft Rx and increased the dose was because SSRIs can possibly cause manic episodes (https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/bipolar-disorder/switching-mood-depression-mania-antidepressants). She only voiced her choice of meds mostly so I just took her word for it. I also mentioned benzos, as those calmed me down during manic episodes but she said overtime they won’t cure it, which is true but it could of been a good option to use while my anti-depressant medication kicked in (Zoloft at the time).

Would you say that my doctor has very little to no clue what to do with me? I’m honestly stuck as well. ",04Mar2019,2
157,"Warning! If the title wasn't obvious.....

If you're not good, don't get worse by reading my drama.

Saturday night I was sitting with my boyfriend and his phone rang. He was like ""who the hell is calling me at 9:40 at night?"" and he answered it and they said they were looking for me. It was some medical something about my dad they said and he handed the phone to me. It was a medical examiner, I assume they found his number listed in his phone and contacted me. He didn't have my number in his phone. My dad is dead. He was in a hotel in the next city over and was supposed to check out Saturday. When he didn't check out they checked out his room and found him dead in the shower with the water running and drug paraphernalia and a white powder residue in the room.

I gave them my brother's number to call and let him know because I didn't even know what to say to anyone. We called my mom but they haven't been together since I was like 5. I didn't know who to get in contact with our anything. The lady on the phone said autopsy and toxicology was going to be Monday (today) and it's 1pm and I still haven't called to find out if it was done. I don't know if I want to know what the results were. They will probably make me more angry.

My mom got ahold of his sister and she wanted me to call her but I had my boyfriend talk to her instead while I was at work because I didn't know what to say to her. I don't know who else knows.

He was living with us for a while, sleeping on the couch and we kicked him out last Sunday (not yesterday obviously) because we gave him every chance to do things right and he just seemed to not care.

I honestly don't know how to feel about it. I'm kind of upset but not really upset. Like I knew it was going to happen some day I just didn't expect that. It's just like.... A thing.... Stuff happens and it sucks but like... I can't dwell on it.

I went to work yesterday and my boyfriend and my friend/coworker/manager of another Dept were telling me I should take the rest of the day off and I told them no. I did talk to my manager and I said I'm only thinking about it when I'm alone and it's not that bad and being here is giving me something to do and I'm ok for now but I told her if that changed I'd let her know. I worked my full shift but I'm off today and tomorrow.

The worst part of it, honestly, is that I keep thinking if we didn't kick him out of our house last Sunday this might not have happened and it's kind of my fault and I know it's not deep down but I can't get that thought out of my head. And he's got a life alert system... Sitting in our bathroom on the counter... If he'd had it would be still be here? But we had valid reasons for kicking him out. He did it to himself. He did all of this to himself.

But I still feel kind of guilty...

The worst part is we're basically responsible for whatever is happening now and we don't have the money to deal with this shit. We're in the process of filing for bankruptcy and my boyfriend is on LOA from work for like 2.5 months now. He didn't have a will as far as I am aware. My mom didn't know of any last wishes. Neither did his sister. His sister said cremation is fine. That still costs a lot. Cheaper than a burial tho. But I'm just pissed off.

I finally felt like we were on the right track, getting our shit together, kicked him out so less drama, and he's still making my life hell in death. I just want to scream at him. Last night I even jokingly asked my boyfriend if we could find a necromancer for hire to bring him back just so I can kill him myself again for this shit....

I'm not looking for sympathy or condolences. I just needed to share with someone. Idk...

My sibling has, since leaving school, stayed at home unable to work living with a non parent relative and finds going out, etc difficult.  I'm not familiar with my family mental history other than that, and that my mother had some kind of episode when I was born where she was unable to leave the hospital unless it was to move from the household with her and her husband, to one with other family members also present at all times (so when my father was at work) though I am not sure if this is true or exaggerated gossip.

I don't really know that I have a good sense of identity and feel as though I've just been acting my entire life (mid 30s).  I'm having memory issues and am starting to worry that reccuring dreams after becoming hard to distinguish from memories of childhood.

I'm originally from the UK and mental health has never really been discussed, I've sort of just been told that as a guy I should cry less so as a kid I tried to cry less.  My sibling and I have not really discussed it much either.

I don't know that I could have gone 30+ years of my life and only now suddenly am not sure how I got that far.  I really feel like I am going insane or something.

I dunno what I am asking for, does anyone know if this is maybe a real thing that could happen to a person,or am I making it all up just to be lazy and not have to interact with people?

170,"For the longest time I have always denied anything being wrong with me, it was probably something to do with me ego when I was younger .

I have now only come to realise and accept Look and my self, for the Past 5 or 6 years or so I have always Kept to my self and Never let anything out to anybody. 

I have for the last 4 years at least I have been  going through Completely random cycles  which I don't understand, forgive me if this is the wrong Reddit but I figured id start somewhere

On a daily Basis I go through cycles where I won't care about anybody or anything that happens around me, but within a moment I find my self in tears over the simplest things like not being able to cross the road in time before the light switched 
And in the same instant turning hyper aggressive to anybody around me for no reason, threatening and yelling at them.

I don't understand any of this, if anybody could offer me advice or send me in the right direction I appreciate this

171,"After being sober from self harm for three years I slipped up last night when the Depression voice got to be unbearable. Nothing bad enough to warrant medical attention. I just feel incredibly stupid for letting myself do it. I know other coping skills. I could have used them but I didn't. I'm grateful that it's winter and I wear long sleeves all the time. But consciously I still know they're there. Which leads back into the beat up myself circle. 

Depression sucks and mental health care in my area sucks (no open spots for me to get into therapy even if I could afford it). It's just frustrating all around because of the negative scripts that I apparently still need to dismantle. ",04Mar2019,3
172,"Well I am in a foreign country on study abroad and I cannot sleep due to my anxiety. I don’t know what the anxiety has stemmed from this time, but I assume it has to do with me being in a foreign country away from many friends and family. It is strange though because I have enjoyed my first two days here. I will admit that maybe my body has yet to adjust to my new sleep cycle and is struggling with that. I just detest this feeling. I was reading before bed and nodding off frequently, but as soon as I turned the light out...bam there is the anxiety. I could not settle the feeling in my chest and also have somewhat of a headache. I try my best to avoid using my phone around bedtime so resorted to reading and some breathing I thought may help. It didn’t too much so here I am reaching out to all my closest friends. Any advice is appreciated. I love you all. 

I just hope so badly to truly be able to control my anxiety some day. Until then, I will continue to try various forms of exercise, breathing, meditation, etc. 

I hope to be able to experience my study abroad to the fullest including alcohol and coffee as it’s a large part of the dining culture of the country I am studying in. However, I am worried I may have to eschew both altogether in order to ward off anxiety. I know my purpose is to study and learn about the culture to its entirety, but it really is aggravating to find that I must avoid certain enjoyments of life due to my anxiety. I know anxiety is something that all living things deal with, but I hope that one day it becomes less prominent in our society for people everywhere as we gain a more thorough understanding of the brain and mental health. 
Well enough from me for now, keep fighting the good fight everyone! I love you all! ",04Mar2019,2
173,"I’m just curious.
Personally, I get a bunch of junk food and sit in bed in my pajamas, put on the TV, start sobbing about nothing, and binge-eat. ",04Mar2019,1
174,"I’ve been under a lot of stress lately, with no sign of it letting up. It’s strange because I’m completely aware of how to stay grounded and realize the nature of my situation. But lately I am struggling to control my anger. Several times throughout the day I find myself holding onto a bubble of hot, burning frustration in my throat. It started off as being “rubbed the wrong way” or being “grumpy” and now I feel like I can’t be around anyone without getting actually angry?
Other people will let these things roll off their backs, no big deal.  Why can’t I do that too? 

I feel like I’m spending all my energy trying to maintain composure through the day. Exhausting.

176,"In 2 hours i will be going to my first therapy session. i’m going because i have super bad anxiety and am severely depressed. i’m scared to go because i don’t know what is going to happen and i’m very nervous. i think i got depressed in the first place because of all the drugs i have done in my life and i’m an idiot for making the choices to take them. i’m only 18 but started smoking when i was 11, eventually led to xans, acid, shit like that. but i wasn’t some crackhead like i never touched meth or heroin and never would in my life. but the past few months i’ve also been taking a lot of xanax and have been putting myself in stupid situations that could have so easily been avoidable. to be honest i shouldn’t be alive right now and i don’t know how i still am. anyways i think my brain is all fucked up from the drugs i’ve took over the years and smoking everyday for the past about 3-4 years now. i hope going to therapy helps and i really hope i straighten my life out. i do not want to be homeless or some bum. i know my potential in life as i have also done a lot of great things and have many talents, but my problems took those over to where i can barely do anything anymore. i just want to go back to being normal and be happy and have a good life.
