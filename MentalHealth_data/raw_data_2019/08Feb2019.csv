2,"""Thanks for the company""

I've heard this phrase a few times over the course of the last few months, and every time, it was like a dose that kept me going for a week.

*First off, apologies in advance for this being probably way too verbose and maybe even of questionable utility, but thank you in advance if you decided to take the time. Additionally, apologies for also using a secondary account, I feel this is doing a disservice to this sub, but this feels way too intimate for me, and I have friends who know my reddit username.*

Like many people here and around the world, I have many pots and pans jangling in my baggage. Lots of my failings have direct connections to events in my past (and present), culminating in anything from PTSD, to chronic insomnia, to perpetually feeling like a second class citizen. Some issues have presented themselves due to recent events and others are a product of nurture or chronic stress since I was a child. 

Although I consider myself incredibly lucky to have experienced a few great things for as long as I could at the time, and I have a few people I can count on one hand who I'd die for, I still feel the impact of the aforementioned failings in my daily life. Every single action is a constant conscious effort. Groceries, work, maintaining a routine, trying to use logic to defeat many impulses and stay out of any traps, I'm sure this rings a bell for a lot of people. Not to mention the fact that due to how I've lived over the past few years, due to toxic family members, financial shortcomings and a personally devastating clerical issue on behalf of my local government, my mind is firmly trained to live day-to-day. I've never been able to feel settled, ever. 

As a result, it feels like such an alien concept to be able to connect to people. It's not that I've always desperately craved human connection, I naturally revert to being alone, and it really irks me when I sense any kind of invasion. On the other hand, with a few select cases, old loved friends or people I really admire, respect, and appreciate, I value it like nothing else. Lately though I found this phrase which makes me realize how tense I've been and how long I'd been holding my guard up until I heard it.

""Thanks for the company""

It's such a simple phrase, but it's the connotations that get me. Some people might use it completely nonchalantly, others might use it with more weight, but it still feels so candid, sincere, and genuine to me. I feel so lucky to have heard it a couple of times lately and every time I wondered why hearing it made me trip over myself momentarily. Every time it happened, it was for something so pleasantly mundane and simple. 

On one occasion, a friend of mine mentioned she was going shopping for a few things (hardware store, groceries, browsing for clothing etc.), and I just asked if I could just come along for the ride. I was just looking forward to the walk, the chat, the window shopping. She was reluctant to bring me along at first regarding it as pretty boring. I reassured her I really didn't give a rat's ass, and that she could basically pretend I was a balloon for all intents and purposes. Fast forward after a good couple of hours of walking in and out of stores, and an actually really enjoyable little outing, we come back to her place. We have some coffee and all that, and then she had to buzz off for a few chores, but not before saying ""Thanks for the company!""

I'm also super fortunate to be able to study music these days after being sabotaged from doing so as a child, as a teen and unable to as an adult for many years. I finally got to enroll at my local Conservatory. There's this young secretary at the Conservatory who's really got a special kind of spark in her eyes, especially when she's talking about something she loves. Even though I consider myself pretty antisocial, I really like watching people go wide-eyed when talking about something they love, cherish, or aspire to. I can't help wanting to prod them to talk more about it. I genuinely enjoy listening. At first, even though I enjoyed talking to her, I tried not to overdo it, since it was her work place, and I didn't want to be the guy always hanging out at her desk for no real reason. Slowly though, conversations kept naturally dragging on. Finally one night, after I was done with class, it was fairly quiet and we started chatting. It just kept going until closing time like an hour and a half later. We started making our way out as she was locking the place up, and before we split, same thing happened. ""Thanks for the company!""

It is such a small thing, but, for me, the connotation of your presence being even remotely appreciated, and making a difference to someone's day feels so foreign and pleasantly surprising. And all that, just because I showed an interest in a couple of people, sat, listened to, commented on what they had to say, or remembered some inconsequential detail they mentioned about their dog or their partner or their really shitty day that one time. Who'd have thought? The people who've uttered these four words are also slowly teaching me to express myself, to let people know I appreciate them, even with simple gestures. This in turn has a knock-on effect on how I interact with friends I really value, but felt unable to show my appreciation for. It helps ease me into expressing myself, something I've struggled with since I was a child. Even more importantly, these words grant me calm. They help me sleep, they help me breathe.

I guess what I'm trying to convey is that these four words do it for me, and they could do it for someone else. More importantly though, I want to say I really respect anyone who performs these small gestures of appreciation. You never know what's behind the curtain, the slightest thing might change someone's day. And in turn, you might teach someone else to perform these gestures and help them express things that *aren't* better left unsaid.

Thank you for your time.",08Feb2019,1
3,"I'm just going to type and see where everything goes. So sorry if there's a lack of coherency 

I'm typing this as I've just had a crying bout. I just can't put everything I'm feeling to words. Everything just feels wrong. I constantly question everything I do from going to college, to eating, to talking to people. Just waking life in general. Even hobbies of mine don't quite feel right (writing, drawing, painting) despite them being my only consistent source of relative happiness. I might have insomnia. There are times I just wake up and purposefully stay awake beacuse I don't want tomorrow to come.

I've been feeling this way ever since junior year of H.S (now junior in college). I feel like I'm acting at this point. Constanlly putting a smile on my face that dosen't want to be there, faking interest in communicating with others to fit in. Soceity leaves me wanting. I feel that what I need and want dosen't exist. 

Anxiety has taken control of my actions no matter how hard I resist. I probably come off as cold to some when I can't hide it. I've pushed people away, friends and romantic, interests either by failing to be how I should be or the anxiety getting in the way of growing said relationships. I just feel like a failure: to my parents, family and friends. They try so hard to be what family should be and I probably fail at returing the favour. I pretty much shut everyone out: only speak when spoken to or I have to force myself. But I still worry a lot about them (health, financial, happiness etc.) as anyone would. But I almost feel paranoid about it. Like I worry too much to the point I can't rationally think. I want to be who they want and need me to be. But just for some reason I can't. And I hate it!

Honestly if things continue like this I'm going to be alone forever. 

I cut sometimes. Last week I did actually. What's worse is that I actually enjoy it. There's just this queer desire in me to bleed . . . Sometimes I just want slash up my body and lay on the ground. I probably am a masochist cause each time I fantasize about situations, it always involves some sort of physical pain to me. There was a time were getting it by a car all I wanted. I do have suicidal thoughts sometimes, but haven't actually acted upon them except for a year ago when I tied a scarf around my neck as an experiment. Honestly the thought of dying or death brings me comfort. I want to lay in my bed and let that be it. Be done with it all.

I just want scream out all the names of the people I love and tell them how much they truly mean to me. How sorry I am that I can't change myself. How sorry I am that I probably ruined any relationship we had together. That I want, every waking moment, of the day to be the person that I'm not. That I'm just sorry.

TL;DR: I'm disinterested in life in general, I cut, anxiety has ruined and is holding me back from relationships with friends and family, some suicidal thoughts, want to give up.",08Feb2019,1
4,"I’m from Scotland, and I have contacted my GP with worries that I might have depression (due to fatigue, self harming and suicidal thoughts) and I have been linked up to be checked, but they will connect me to a Psychiatrist within 10 working days (it has been 5 so far)
However, with my fatigue I am struggling to get out of bed. I either wake up and cry and have no motivation to get up or I sleep through my alarm. I have missed so much school work due to this, I haven’t been to school this whole week due to it getting worse. When I do get out of bed it’s always very late in the afternoon, and I either try to power through my schoolwork or try to meet friends; so they don’t get worried about me. My parents are becoming very impatient with me, yet I am afraid to tell them the reason for my absences (due to their opinions on mental health and their lack of support for when I have breakdowns, etc)
I want to reach out and ask if anyone has any tips that would help me overcome this, until I am prescribed medication. I want to be able to keep up with school and not have anyone judge me for my “laziness” because it’s bringing down my self esteem so much and I don’t want to do anything stupid.
Any tips on how to get out of bed would be appreciated. Even if it means I’ll be late to school everyday, I just want to be able to do my schoolwork. Much kindness x",08Feb2019,1

6,"Hi r/mentalhealth

&amp;#x200B;

I just need to vent, while people around me may be supportive, no-one truly knows whats going on. My biggest issues have always been anxiety, but it builds slowly in me and feels like a building pressure or fire. This anxiety manifests in the worst ways, instead of panic attacks I'll get depressed, so circle inwards in my head (to the point my parents once thought I had autism), this depression, manifests in the worst possible way as well, becoming violent anger (sometimes resulting in explosive anger, which can be sudden 5 seconds or so vivid thoughts accompanied by a sickening level of rage and thoughts so vivid they are almost hallucinations), and back in my school days, led to probably several hundred fights (I was not an imposing child). As a child and now, I'm usually just someone who wants to make life easier and kinder for everyone, because I want it too. I'm an adult now, with a wife and my own life, but I'm barely functional, keeping myself behaving within societal norms is walking a knifes edge where if I fall off someone else can get hurt. 

&amp;#x200B;

I never had a childhood, I was young but I wasn't happy until I could get away from school, other people, my parents. I wanted to die from such a young age I can't truly remember a time I was happy. Sure, I've found some happiness now, doesn't mean my problems are over. For background, I'm in my mid-twenties now, and was only diagnosed with anxiety disorder when I was 22. I've found a very precarious balance I'll outline later, but I feel like there's no way forward now, if this is the best I'll have for my life, what's the point?

&amp;#x200B;

I take cipralex for the anxiety and it helps but it isn't perfect since I'm drug sensitive, and you can't custom order a specific dose, if the pill doesn't cut to the correct size I have to do weird portioning half-life math to make sure I get enough and don't over-medicate either which can feel like I've poisoned myself. I also get pretty much every side effect on the bottle including heavy nausea, the extreme need to eat, dry mouth, tiredness, and the inability to sleep. Trying something new isn't something I'm willing to do, this drug works and trying others will put me at risk of dragging me into the scariest part of my life again. I want to specify that I am certain I was one of the few children born with anxious depression rather than developing it, meaning I only felt normal for the first time after seeking help in college when I was dropping out (After a 6 month stint of agoraphobia in my college rental). It takes so much out of me to try an be normal that if anything in my balance is off I may as well be on disability as I couldn't exist as a productive member of any workforce.

&amp;#x200B;

On another point I am near certain I have some secondary undiagnosed issue. My memory is severely affected as well, I know that due to the narcissism of my parents I was frequently being gaslighted during my formative years, if anything bad happened that I remember, it either never happened, or was completely different, or I'm over stating it according to them, because they can do no wrong. I know that due to this I walked around in a haze as I couldn't trust my day-to-day, I mean, I still thought then that I could trust my parents. I may however have ADHD that was never diagnosed, I go a mile a minute and am not satisfied if I can't do something in quantity and always want to be productive, but this is also how my thoughts are which makes my mind very muddled. As some friends have stated that were diagnosed with this, I know it came come up as depression in certain people.

&amp;#x200B;

Nowadays I can keep myself happiest by doing low-demand work. I got very lucky with a very supportive wife and a slightly higher than minimum wage work-from-home type job. Problem is I want more and I almost break myself every time I try and get over those hurdles to a better life. I figure it's a 50/50 shot for me to even be able to complete a 1 year course at this point, my memory problems are probably permanent, and it takes a balance of prescription drugs, weed to eliminate the very pronounced side effects of those drugs, and a very low stress environment just to behave normally. I'm on a tightrope where I'm comfortable and falling off could mean I hurt someone I love. I just have no-one to talk to who I know truly understands it, support is one thing but its completely different to have it from someone who deals with the same thing, and I've been completely alien in some ways to absolutely everyone else my entire life.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, while I've stated I'm happy-ish, I feel like I should pursue more but can't without destroying that balance, and keeping in mind, that balance isn't my 'comfort zone', its the bleeding edge of normalcy. Constantly breaking my 'comfort zone' just to get shit done (hey, at least I'm productive) is exhausting and has left me mentally worn out for over a year. I just can't feel like I care about most things which leads into the pointlessness of it all if I can't get myself into a higher place. The only good part of any of this could be the fact that I just don't take shit from anyone, and having a subdued ability to care means I can get away with faking confidence I don't actually have.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to state here near the end that I know and feel very lucky still in some ways. I live in PEI Canada which is a relatively small island in the Atlantic, I'm a short walk from the port and beaches, I have a low demand job that allows me to work from home, I live right around the corner from where I work and everything I need, and a lovely little dog in an apartment I like. My wife is loving and understanding in ways I could never be. I'm not writing this because I'm depressed, I'm just tired because no-one can relate to what I deal with in my head and in my past and I'm frustrated that in almost 30 years of my life no-one I've met gets it.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry if I'm not writing this in a story-like manner, I've been told I can be a bit robotic in text and I don't Reddit very often.

&amp;#x200B;

(I know I'm being melodramatic right now to a degree, I've been very ill lately and combining that with a dreary winter which stops me from getting the physical exorcise I get in the summer and I'm a mess)

7,"First off, please, no hate comments. I'm already struggling enough. 

My entire life I've struggled with something. I've been to several therapists and psychiatrists and everything in between. I've been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and more recently, bipolar. The lesser of the two types though. Doctors have tried giving me different prescriptions but nothing seems to have worked. As of now, I haven't had insurance for almost a year and I'm unemployed do to the severity of everything. I'm insanely paranoid that someone is always watching me and waiting behind a closed door, or my backyard, or any other potential hiding spot, ready to attack. 

My anxiety keeps me from sleeping most nights. I'm lucky if I get one or two hours of sleep and I'm sure that doesn't help anything. I'm terrified of being on my own but my partner works to keep us alive so we got a dog. I absolutely love animals and used to love volunteering at the shelter. But that's back when I could leave my house. If not for my dog, I'm pretty sure I would have killed myself a long time ago. I still think about it a lot, but then she comforts me by laying on me or just being adorable like dogs are.

Here's where it gets really shitty and I'm already crying again before I typed this. You can probably guess where it's going but for the last year, I now get these terrible bursts of anger. As someone who never felt anger much before, this has caused me great distress. Which only makes it worse. I get angry and have an outburst, then sulk and get mad at myself for being so stupid and tell myself I don't deserve to live. 

Well, our dog isn't a support dog. We got her as a puppy and much of her training has been sporadic because I can hardly function with to keep myself alive. Because of this, she mostly behaves but has a tendency to, well, be a dog. Which in my normal mind, I'm fine with. It's mostly her barking that's an issue because she barks all of the time which spikes my anxiety because it's so sudden.

She definitely doesn't get the exercise she requires either. I keep myself cooped up all day and let her out several times but she is confined to a rope because we don't have a huge yard and what we have isn't fenced in. So I understand why she behaves the way she does, you know? Which makes it so much worse knowing I'm the reason she doesn't behave the way I want her to and then still not being able to do anything proactive about it. We're living on one paycheck so training is not much of an option. 

Well, I've been avoiding saying it, but today when she barked, it was so abrupt and scared me so bad. And then I got so angry I pinned her and smacked her butt. It wasn't enough to cause any permanent damage or anything, but it's like I wasn't in control. I don't remember even pinning her down and as soon as I realized what I did, I immediately got up and left the room to break down into tears. And she came to comfort me which makes it so much worse. Dogs are too pure and I don't deserve her. I've always been so passive and these feelings are so foreign and I've never hit anyone or anything ever before. I'm so disgusted with myself and hate myself even more which I, frankly, didn't know was possible. 

It boils down to, I should rehome her, right? No dog deserves anything other than all of their wants on a silver platter and I know I'm not providing that. I've had her for 3 years now and the anger thing is new. I think I already know what the correct thing to do is, I guess I just needed some advice. My partner doesn't know the extent of my anger so that's a conversation I'll have to have as well. I'm just so worried. I don't know who I am anymore. I need to go to a doctor but without insurance, there's no way we can afford to go. I don't know what I'll do without the dog, but I don't want this to ever happen to her again. And if I end up killing myself after, isn't that what I deserve? What if I ever try to attack a person too? 

I'm so scared of who I'm becoming. I don't know what to do.",08Feb2019,1
8,"I've included country in the title because I hoped it might find me some relevant information. I'm not far from Sydney, but I'd be happy to travel interstate for the right care. Though any input is appreciated even if you're not from here.

Anyhow, hi everyone.

The short of it is that I'm 21, and have diagnoses of BPD, PTSD and schizophrenia. Although a psych I've started seeing recently has suggested it's dissociative psychosis instead. I don't care about what they call it, but I know I need further help.

My emotional state, is very good after doing a year of DBT and another year of changing the way I live my life. I'm on antipsychotics and antidepressants, and they work well. I'm pretty happy. I have good friends, I love my dog and I live a healthy lifestyle these days. I'm more stable than ever and I can manage my emotions. And I rarely hallucinate thanks to the meds.

But my functioning, is limited and deteriorating. I don't know how else to put it. I'm on welfare because I can't work for more than one day a week without shutting down. I'm forgetting things, forgetting people and losing memories. I'm okay right now, but I know I sometimes end up incoherent or not able to speak at all. I keep a journal so I can remember important things, but I don't always remember writing in it.

Lately, if I eat anything that's energy-dense I find myself uncontrollably sad. Not guilt-sad, but biologically-sad and full of nervous energy in a way I can't explain, and I can only liken it to a bad hormone fluctuation or drinking way too much coffee. For example, I ate some mcnuggets last night and a few hours later my emotions started to slide for no other reason. It's still the case currently, it'll last for a day. It's happened every time I've eaten some pizza or anything similar in the last few months, or anything with sugar.
But now it extends to anything that's not purely vegetables and maybe some super lean meat and one small meal a day only.

As a result I'm losing weight very fast, which isn't a bad thing because last year I put on a lot, but I'm losing about a kilo per week and I'm not exercising beyond walking the dog. I've lost 10+kg since mid-December and it's not been entirely intentional.

I'm scared. My doctors don't know what is happening or why. But they don't seem to be offering any serious solutions, just ""we'll keep monitoring"". So I'm here looking for suggestions on what type of professional might be able to tell me what the hell is going on. Am I going to waste away? Is my brain shutting down? Is my body unable to process energy? Do I need to see a neurologist? Endocrinologist? Dietician? Does any of this sound familiar to anyone at all?

TLDR: Brain function deteriorating and body not processing energy right, and I feel like something awful is happening to me and nobody seems to understand what. Any suggestions at all are appreciated.",08Feb2019,1
9,"This is probably going to be a rant so sorry about that. I'm just feeling really alone right now. I feel like I don't know who I am anymore or what I'm doing. And these thoughts and feelings won't leave me alone and it's driving me crazy. I don't know how to control my emotions which is so scary and the thought that I will always be this way is so terrifying to the point that I don't know why I'm even trying even though I know that there is so much more out there. I just don't want to be like this anymore. 

I just feel like I can't really talk to anyone nor do I know how to even begin to bring up these thoughts or if I do I'm just dismissed because it's ""just the depression talking"" but I feel like it's so much more. I generally feel that I have or am developing an ED as well as I don't know like Bipolar. Everything is about food. Everytime I eat I feel dread and guilt and I hate myself for it. My mood changes are so extreme like one minute I'm so happy and I can anything. Next, I'm hatching a plan to kill myself in a matter of seconds. These mood changes are partly why I feel so lost I just don't know who I am anymore. I don't know what to do but at the same time I do. Literally, I'm just so worried that I will always be that way and always feel those things and I can't cope with the thought of that.

13,"I'm sure that everyone has had an accomplishment, whether you got a good grade on an assignment, nailed a cool magic trick or got first place in a sports competition but you don't feel like you should take pride in it? When I get complimented on something, I don't feel like I should acknowledge my accomplishment or take pride in what I've done. Even now, as I'm writing this, I am very wary of talking about my achievements for fear of being seen as a person who brags. I think that this a real fear that a lot of people have, and often we get accused of ""fishing for compliments"". I suppose that it comes from this feeling of ""I have to get better"" or ""a lot of people have done that"" that feeling of never being enough. Even when I know that I should be happy with my work, I'm not, and that's not something that can be fixed overnight.

&amp;#x200B;

Just to illustrate my point, I'll give an example in my real life. I was 14 when I got a poem I had written published in a book that was featuring young poets across the country. I was happy but not really. I often thought that ""it's not really being published because it wasn't my work independently that was being published, it was almost everyone who had submitted a piece, I'm just another name at the end of the credits"". Or when I would get an A- on a test, ""I should have studied harder, I should have tried better to get an A+"", and the list goes on. But my outlook changed for the better. I remember seeing this video where a woman was explaining the meaning behind her tattoos, and one of them was *Fight For Your Right To Party*. She explained that she had gotten it to remind herself to celebrate her accomplishments and not dismiss them. That really stuck with me for a long time, and it still does. It's not an easy mentality to change but I think reminding yourself to be proud can certainly go a long way. I still struggle with this and I probably always will but that's okay, because I'm still going to fight for my right to celebrate my accomplishments. I wrote this post so that I can have a tangible reminder to myself, and maybe it can remind others. I'll leave you with this:

Recently, I started a youtube channel and wasn’t sure what to focus my videos on. But then I realized that my purpose in life may be to just try to help and inspire others, even if I only impact one person’s life.

18,"I don’t usually post stuff like this but I don’t know who to talk to. Sorry for the long post I just think writing something out might help me rn. When I was 12 I became severely depressed, anxious and suicidal triggered by a mixture of developing chronic fatigue syndrome after a bad case of glandular fever, my horrendous school life and lack of friends and possibility the state of the house (my mum has fibromyalgia and my dad died when I was 9 so we struggled). I don’t know how but my mental health started improving slowly (no longer suicidal but still depressed and anxious) and then I met a boy at school I liked when I was 14 (let’s call him B) and we got together. Basically he was my first ever anything but also ended up coercing me into sex for a very long time because we didn’t have protection I never wanted to and was always terrified I was gonna get pregnant. Then we managed to get protection when I was 16 and I became way more comfortable with sex but he continued to ignore consent (and was generally sexually abusive) and at one point flat out raped me. We stay together because I’m an idiot and didnt want to believe it was non consensual. Fast forward a few years he got into his dream uni hours away and I can’t move with him so we decide to break up because he’s a compulsive liar and generally untrustworthy and that would be horrendously way too stressful for me. We end up breaking up and I get a new (long distance) boyfriend who i’d been friends with for years which causes B to get really mad and we’re no longer on speaking terms. I’ve stopped being secretive about what he did to me and have told people but quite a few don’t believe me which I was kinda expecting but it still hurts. B ends up dating my “best friend” who knows he raped me so I decide she’s not really my best friend anymore which sucks. I think for a while I was relying on B’s inevitable move to uni as an escape from the house I’m currently living in and a way to start my own life because I can’t do that on my own due to chronic fatigue that’s still pretty bad and making me unfit for work but because of that and my mum also being chronically ill she can’t work so I’m a source of income for our (giant old shitty falling apart) house so I’m unable to move because I don’t think I’d be able to cope living on my own and I’d be taking money away from my mum and two young sisters that’s a portion of the household money and I think I’m now coming to that realisation fully that I’m just gonna be stuck here and I don’t know what to do and I feel useless and I’ve cried every night for the past week and that’s not normal for me anymore and now I’m scared I’m declining again.",08Feb2019,1

Some examples of her paranoia include thinking that she is being watched by government officials, people spying on her, etc.

She has covered everything in the house that is digital, such as the clock on the stove, she has unplugged the tv and turned it towards the wall, she's also unscrewed the fire detector and she has recently covered the light fixtures with either paper towels and things like reusable plastic shopping bags.  She's also covered the heating vents on the walls with what appears to be plastic Venetian blinds. 

She lives with my elderly mother in law who suffers from dementia and my SIL refuses all and any treatment.  We have tried so many times to no avail.

25,"Hey everyone. Been ages since I've been on here. Been extremely low. I'm not out of the woods yet, just at a place I think I can share. 

Everyday just been kicked in the balls. In every part of my life. Financially, more than half my military pension was cut. A week before Christmas. My wife's hours at work have been cut back ""for the foreseeable future"", we got hit with $2000+ of medical appts at once for the kids. There was only one thing that kept my sanity from completely slipping away was my woodworking, which I can no longer afford to do. 

Family, still having issues with my parents accepting that I need a 2 week in patient stay thus won't help with school drop offs and the like for my kids. Things went nuclear between my wife and her brother which resulted in a rift in the family. Which ended up with my father in law living with us, but will be out soon. 

There was a TAFE (eqiv to trade school maybe) in furniture making that looked awesome. But my wife works the night it is on. Hey, how about we get a babysitter? Damn! Can no longer afford a babysitter. Which probably was for the best. I found out the course was $4000. They have a payment plan. But that's 4 fortnightly payments of $1000. 

This all equaled me most likely having to go back to work. But I need rehab clearance and my GP and psychiatrist will not clear me. There's more but I think I've taken up enough of your time. 

I have been circling the drain for this entire time. Quite a few suicidal thoughts, some progressed past ideation (15 years since that's happened) and SO many self harm thoughts, and maybe a few small cuts here and there. 

Oh yeah, and I got through most of it thinking ""it's all good. I see my psych next week"". Cancels the day of due to illness. 6 weeks till next appt.

34,"Hi I’m not too familiar with this app, in fact it’s my first ever post. I’m mainly making this because I am really struggling. I’m in my second year at university as a nursing major and I suck at making friends. I notice it comes so easy to everyone around me, but personally it is one of the hardest things. I grew up raised by both parents, however my dad was and still is a very controlling figure in my life. He’s a good man, but he was very scary towards me and my younger brother growing up. We were screamed at just about everyday for the smallest things. He said no to everything. Birthdays, sleepovers, trips. Whatever he says, goes. There is no talking things out. In fact I can’t remember ever having a conversation with him where I was being heard. He showed little interest in what we wanted. It reached to the point where I didn’t even know what I wanted for myself because my father had always already decided for me. That mostly still goes today, although since I’m a bit older I have a little more say (with the help of my mom). I lack social skills and never learned how to create and maintain healthy relationships with others. My father raised us in fear, and never once taught us the value of confidence. I feel anxious when there are eyes on me for too long, and when I do finally have a moment to speak with someone (usually responding to a question) I come off so awkward I can feel the tension. I hate being so anxious all the time, especially when having to interact with just about anyone. I feel like everyone thinks I’m weird (although it’s more than likely all in my head) I can’t help the thoughts. I constantly feel like people are watching me and judging me and it’s so hard to fight these thoughts. I am tired. Mental health is a huge part of my life that has become more apparent only recently. I’ll be done school in two more years, and with this time I really want to better myself as a whole. I love my father despite all his wrongs, because in the end I know he loves me. Yes, he is a pain and I have reached a point where I avoid him as much as possible( I feel that he one of many direct sources that cause my anxiety and depression) but I feel immense guilt also. He still provided whatever was necessary for me growing up. I never went hungry, and there was always enough for us. He was and still is a great provider. And sometimes I just want to cry because I think of him and my heart breaks. He has a sweet, goofy, loving side that I was also exposed to growing up. But the pain that came with being screamed at and beaten down with words constantly is unbearable. Lately I’ve been reflecting a lot on my upbringing and a lot of my pain goes back to my father ( and my mother she was not the most stable person). I did not have a stable family life. My parents fought constantly, they were young and broke and had just come to America. My father always pushed me to do well in school and still does. He helps pay for as much as he can and I still live at home just until I finish with nursing. My mental health is getting really hard to cope with and I am conflicted on how to feel towards my father. I love him, but I am also so angry with him for the pain and fear I feel every time I leave my house. I don’t know what to do. And I don’t want to be angry with him because I know I will look back on these years and regret being mad at him while I still have him here. ",08Feb2019,1

I'm part of a friend group who are all depressed jerks. We like memes, playing video games together. But we all love eachother, and the others love me. 

I'm not a jerk in fact; I'm the most compassionate out of all of us. I think this is what's led my otherwise straight friend to develop an attraction to me as I am the most feminine and loving person out of the group.

But there are times when maybe I'm not so compassionate, and I joke about important matters that may be sensitive to some people but I always feel guilty afterwards.

Anyways yesterday was at my table with my friends and the topic of non-verbal autistic people came up and we were cracking jokes about how funny communication for them is.

Later on I was at my therapist appointment and  in my therapist waiting room there was an older non-verbal woman, sitting with her living assistant. She got upset over something and the assistant handled it rather poorly.

Other times I wish she was understanding, open minded, and actually cared about us more than making money and impressing relatives who aren’t any better.

43,"A little back story. My girlfriend has always struggled with depression, but it did not get REALLY bad until she was in her 30s. About 2 years ago (before we met) she had gone to a local park intent on drowning herself. This was her first time actually having a plan for self harm. She reached out to her sister, who got there in time. Several months later, she had another episode, and her family took her to a local hospital and she checked in to a behavioral health center. 

Since we have been together, there have been occasional days where her illness really takes hold and she will spend 20-30 hours or so in bed. One time a few months back, she texted me and asked me to come home because she was thinking about overdosing on prescriptions, and wanted me to take her to the hospital. I did so, and she ended up not being admitted; doctor felt she was not a danger. 

Fast forward to yesterday. I was getting ready for work and I heard her in bed sobbing. I went in and she just wanted me to hold her for a while. After a few minutes, she told me I needed to take all of her prescriptions with me when I left for work. Obviously I did not leave. She ultimately asked me to take her to the hospital, and this time she was admitted to behavioral health, and she’ll be there at least a couple more days. 

Her diagnosis is depression and anxiety. Living with her, I see the types of high highs and low lows more associated with manic depression (In bed one day, cleaning the house and rearranging furniture 2 days later), but I’m obviously not a doctor, and I don’t know shit. 

She has daily meds for depression (Prozac, I think, which she is compliant with), and “as needed” meds for anxiety (Xanax, I THINK, and she hates taking it). Along with some other medications for some physical ailments. I don’t know the full list, but she takes probably 5 or 6 pills per day.

I am not a complete stranger to living with someone who suffers from mental illness; my mother was bipolar and had crippling social anxiety.  My oldest sister suffers from depression and is an addict; luckily a few years ago she switches addictions from pills and booze over to exercise. Both mother and sister made a few actual suicide attempts while I was a child. Point is, I have seen some things and I don’t scare easy. 

I love this woman. More than I’ve loved anyone in the past; ex wife and girlfriends and others just have not made me feel like she does. When she is not in a “deep dive” as she calls it, she is a lovely and positive and truly good person to be around. So obviously I won’t leave her. But I also don’t want a front row seat to self destruction. 

I know there is no flipping a switch method to happiness. I know there is not really anything I can do to “fix” her and make her love herself. But what are some things I can do to be supportive? To show love and make her feel valued? How can I help her, or at least, how can I make sure I don’t make things worse when she is going through dark patches?

They would get unreasonably angry about how ""stupid"" other people were for wearing their hearts on their sleeves. I was punished as a child when I cried, and I would also get shamed for being over-excited about anything so I stopped showing emotions in front of them and everyone else. I've had friends growing up who called me a robot. Despite this, I poured my heart into art starting at a young age. My parents used to also make fun of the things I would draw (which was my only means of expression), while publicly saying they were proud of me when I won awards and whatnot, so I stopped showing them my drawings. This was my life until I went to college and learned that this wasn't a good environment and that my emotions were overall really messed up.  


As as adult I've been better, and learned how to express to my friends that I love them and to be more open with my feelings. I feel emotions, but I feel a lot of shame when I express them. I am now trying to be a creative professional but I'm having trouble being excited about my projects in front of others, which is something I need to do in my field.  


I'm starting a D&amp;D campaign soon with my friends but roleplaying is a requirement for this campaign and I'm overwhelmed with stress because I want desperately to be involved in this game with my friends but the idea of acting and expressing my emotions makes me recoil even though the rational part of my brain tells me I'm allowed to be expressive. I feel like if I roleplay, everyone else at the table will be like my parents and secretly (or not secretly) think I'm stupid. I honestly can't gauge how they feel about me as a player. I feel like if I don't roleplay well enough, I'll ruin the game. But I want to play because I want to have some form of social life. It's just like, every time I try to act I just feel stupid mid-way through talking and I can't continue because I feel so disgusted with myself. I'm realizing this messes me up in my creative career as an animator, because I need to develop characters and be expressive and sometimes act as those characters.  


I do not keep in contact with my parents if I can help it, and I do not consider emotions a weakness in others, just myself. I feel shame about my art, I've only recently been able to show my partner (who I love and trust more than anyone) my art without saying ""please don't think I'm stupid for drawing this"". Even typing up something like this that exposes my emotions makes me feel ashamed.  


Anyone else deal with this or know some reading I can do regarding this? What would this even be called if I wanted to look it up? What are small steps I can take to be able to express myself? I go to therapy but honestly I have so many other issues piled up for us to work on but I'll bring this up anyway. Anything I can read up on online or maybe books I can check out before I can get to work on this issue with my therapist? I'm sorry if this is a stupid question, I just don't know if anyone in my life understands. Thank you for reading.",08Feb2019,1
49,"I recently turned 16 and am a guy. I have been struggling with depression for the past 3 years but it hasn't got really bad until this year. This is gonna sound really stupid but please dont judge too hard. I had my birthday with just my family. I had fun but a couple hours after everyone left I wanted a piece of cake. (no body wanted any at the time of the ""party"" because it was midday). I saw my cake ""Happy 16 b-day anon"". I saw that felt normal ish but had a strong compulsion to take a photo of it. Which is really weird because I dont take photos of almost anything. After I took the photo I started feeling really really sad. But I still wanted cake so I started to take the candles out. I started crying, but kept taking out the candles and got a plate. Still crying I took my piece and went to my room to which I cried more. I don't even know why but I just did. I felt terrible and I cried more than I ever had in my entire life. I have been suicidal for about a year but the only thing that has been holding me back was my only dream I guess you could say to be in the military. I have been holding back on getting help for so long because if I get treatment or report mental illness for more than 6 months I get disqualified from the military, the only thing holding me back. In addision my parents love me but they wouldnt really understand why and if I tell them they would know how to react and all it would do is make things awkward in my family.

50,"I've been struggling with things for a very long time now. Ever since I was a very small child. I was hurt and abused by my family and that's all I've ever known. I recently found out that I am struggling with PTSD and depression. I'm still very young, I'm 15 years old and I'm trying to overcome my pain. I've grown to realize that my sadness and fear does not define me as a person and because of that I'm trying to help myself along with the people in my life who are trying to as well. 

I have surrounded myself with positive people who are always there for me during any time of need. I recently reached out to my school counselors and they made sure to let me know they are always there. I also have very supportive friends who are always willing to listen to me cry about literally everything in my life. With all this support, I have been pushing myself harder to be happier despite all the chaos and sadness in my life. Instead of feeling sad and locking myself in my room, I go out for walks or redirect my sadness into something I'm passionate about like music and art. I've also been struggling with school and grades but I decided to finally reach out to my teachers who were all understanding. I do admit, it does get hard. I do have a fair share of bad days but I'm proud of myself for trying to be better and not letting myself fall down a deep, dark hole. I'm proud of myself for pushing through and I believe anyone can push through as well. There is always an end to something including pain and darkness. You just have to work for it.

52,"What advise would be useful for gain back the weight. I’m not feeling many depression symptoms currently, but food still has no tase. It’s used to be an enjoyable activity going out to different restaurants and trying new foods. Now I have to remember to eat. The easiest thing for me to eat is usually a protein shake. My MD just says how it’s unhealthy to loose that much weight. She said stick with my DASH diet (family history of hypertension and borderline myself) and had me advise a nutritionalist. The only real change that was suggested was increasing my daily calories. I have never been overweight or underweight, and staying healthy usually comes easily. I’m worried that losing 20% of you body weight in a short span without trying is not good. Both my doctors have found nothing wrong although I’m underweight now.

53,"I was hoping to find a therapist of some sort to begin working on finding out what exactly I need help with. I've been to a psychiatrist for a few months about 6 years ago, and I really didn't gel with the guy. Very impersonal, not very talkative and also gave me medication that wasn't really in the direction I was trying to go. I want a relationship like what Jennifer Melfi and Tony Soprano had- just that sheer openness that you really can't have with someone else. 
I know my father has OCD, and I've noticed some tendencies that match his in my own behavior. I also seem to have a lot of difficulty with focus, especially if the activity is not what I want to do(i.e. schoolwork, much to my detriment). Not that I think I know what's best for me, but I've had a few experiences with illicit use of Adderall. When I used it those few times, the only way I can describe how it made me feel was ""this is what I think normal people feel like all the time"". I had more self confidence(usually near zero) and I was able to actually make myself get up and do the tasks I had to do. 

As a side question, how would you guys suggest I bring up that I'm interested in trying out this particular medication? Like I said, I want a truthful relationship with this counselor and I'm hoping that by being open, they might work with me a bit and at least test to see if I'd qualify for that treatment route.",08Feb2019,1
54,"Hey, kind of a vent incoming.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this sounds a bit strange, but I just cannot help it.  I took a medically certified test shortly after my therapy started in 2012. Therapy ended in 2015 but didn't really help that much. One thing that stuck with me, however, was the IQ Test. After having spent hours completing it (I think it was a 3 hour test, although I cannot really remember) it came back with an IQ of 128 and an estimation of my psychologist towards 140. At the time, I did not really care, but now I have finished school and am heavily failing my academic career at a uni. I have no motivation at all to do anything, I don't even attend all classes, do absolutely not a single thing more than is absolutely necessary and have failed my math test this first semester, just a few days ago. 

For years, I thought that IT was the thing I want to study. I basically have no real interests left in life, there's nothing that really ""picks me up"", if you know what I'm saying. The only thing that I can spend time on without regretting it is assembling PCs and talking to people about what kind of hardware they need and advising them. It's not often that I get to do it, but it's something I can certainly enjoy more than permanently wasting my time while I should be studying.

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't want to be a failure. But I just have no idea where this IQ is coming from? What is it good for? If I remember correctly it had some different segments to it and I was mainly good in logical conclusions, visual thinking and linguistic abilities (excuse any incorrect terms, English is not my mother tongue).

And now I'm just unsure. Did I pick the wrong thing to study? Am I too ""stupid""? Do I need therapy? Is this whole IQ thing completely irrelevant?

How do I know what really suits me?

In theory, I now have a whole semester to get answers (because I signed up for the next semester before the tests), but I'm somewhat afraid of just wasting that time again, just like I did in the first semester. I just wish that I could do the same as I did in Gymnasium (basically German high school) and just do nothing and still get a range of A's to C's. Only rarely I ever got a D, but I did absolutely nothing for it and then crushed it in the finals with 2 A's, 2 B's and one C in the 5 final tests, which caused my overall results to be quite respectable.

Any of you got any advice? I just feel terrible as of recently and kinda need to vent. I am 18 yo now, soon to be 19 in April. I still have my life in front of me, but I don't want to waste potential.

It gives me really bad anxiety and I have no idea what to do about it. This keeps me awake everytime I have to deal with it.


The only way I can describe what I'm experiencing in my head is like 90 voices are all trying to talk to me at once and I'm trying to pay attention to all of them. Then I'll see a picture of a demon head staring at me.

57,"Long story short, my sister-in-law is a real piece of work, but is currently living with us primarily so we can make sure her kids have some stability. She's been abusing Rx drugs, stealing money from family, and is generally a pathological liar. There was a couple months where we kicked her out (after she stole from us) and I basically told my wife ""never again"". I noticed that all of my anxiety that I had recently been feeling went away and things felt normal again.

For better or worse, I'm a huge pushover when it comes to my wife. She also has some bad mental health issues (as does her sister), so I tend to cave in situations where I know she'll get depressed if I say no. So I let her sister move back in because she was upset about the kids. 

As soon the three of them moved back in, my anxiety and depression went through the roof. This past morning, I had a full blown panic attack and wound up sitting in the shower for 45 minutes, doing everything in my power to not hurt myself. I haven't had any suicidal thoughts in months, and I've had 3 in the last 24 hours (not anything I act on anymore). If it wasn't for my valerian root supplement, I would've never made it through the day (don't know how or why that stuff works for me, but it does). Obviously that's concerning to me, but the other thing that worries me is the rage that my sister-in-law brings out in me. I had anger issues for a while before I met my wife, but I generally have total control of it. When her sister is doing dumb crap like swindling her grandma out of money, I visualize myself literally smacking some sense into her and forcibly removing her from our house. It makes my blood pressure spike, that sends the anxiety out of control, and the cycle just keeps going. 

I really want to be there for my wife and her plans for a well thought out intervention for her sister, but I feel like we've been down a similar road before and it didn't work. So I don't know if it's better for me in the long run to support her because I care about her mental well being, or if I should take some other approach that focuses more on making sure I don't go down another depression/anxiety spiral.

And sorry if any/all of this seems like rambling. It's late and I can't sleep and needed to vent.",08Feb2019,1

But the life transition I am going through right now is the most difficult aspect of grief. I am sad yet angry at myself. Never in my life have I felt so alone despite having great people in my everyday life. Change is good yet painful. I judge and compare my life to others.

Bf (22) has been best friend and greatest support for \~3 years. really good guy, we have our ups and downs but we are very similar people and see eye to eye on most things. we usually live together but we long distance right now and we have been before. its really hard for us and we are always working through the kinks.

lately i have been feeling something i will get in waves once in a while, but for some reason i am taking it way more seriously now. I want to leave, not even just him, but everything. I have had plans for a long time, before i even knew him, to travel the country and the world and hike and camp and whatever. now that desire is growing even stronger. for the first time i am feeling really good about being able to care for myself. i'm cooking and cleaning and walking and singing and biking and organizing and laughing and being calm. i feel anxious around people still but thats just from my desperate need for validation and affirmation at every moment of every day lol aaaa. but i really feel strong! like i feel like a real person who can take care of them-self and be self sufficient.

but even I see the flaws in my reasoning. I text bf every day. we skype once a weekish. we are very invested in each others ideas and plans. plus idk if im even that independent, my roommates are the main reason i cook and clean on a regular basis. that's non necessarily a bad thing, but i'm starting to wonder if I even take care of myself for myself? or if i'm just taking care to keep people happy or maintain some nice image of myself. but even that i don't fully know

regardless of all those thoughts, a feeling is persisting. *i really want to run away.* I want to break up, i want to tell my parents to fuck off, i want to throw out my phone, i want to trade my car in for a truck or a van and i want to just keep going. i want to never see anyone i know again. i want to scream and sing and laugh alone forever. i don't want to impress people anymore. i don't feel like working on a relationship anymore. i don't feel like trying or interacting or being someone's anything. I want to belong to me and run away and have that be it.

but then i come back to reality. and i think of how much it hurts to wait for a text from him. and suddenly i could never dream of leaving. to be clear this is not about his personality or actions or how we interact at all. he makes me super happy and we have developed a strong connection after this long. we have the next years planned out and so on. i am more referring to a feeling of missing out, or maybe a need for self validation???

am i a terrible girlfriend? am i even in love? if i loved him would i even have these thoughts? is this a sign that its already over or that i'm fooling myself? i really do love him so much and could not imagine myself with anyone else in the whole world. but sometimes i also can't imagine myself with anyone. if someone could please explain to me what this feeling is I would love that haha. i feel really conflicted and lost and horrible and guilty but i have no one to talk to about it bc i have huge fears of having my relationship not being taken seriously (which links to my validation issues aaaa lol)

i don't know if i believe in that whole ""taking time to be single for yourself"" stuff, i don't want to give up and amazing relationship and then realize it was my depression pushing me away

63,"My ex (F 27) and I (M 30) met during an interesting time in both of our lives 4 years ago, I lived in Georgia working for a transportation company and she lived in California. Within 1 month of conversing via Facebook messenger and being social media friends for 10 years, I got my first assignment that would bring me to California. This gave me reason to finally meet her. That was January 2016. I didn’t make it official with her until the following July. I felt good about taking things slow with her, as opposed to previous situations. We spent a lot of time together over the years, we traveled across the U.S. together, we went through homelessness together, surgeries, holidays with family and friends, we have a lot of the same interests, and really can be ourselves with one another. That’s something she has admitted to have not been able to do with others, and I felt the same. 

Although there’s a lot of good I came into our relationship with insecurities from my previous relationship. I was cheated on plus there was a lot of manipulation and confusion, so I ended up losing myself. I took a year and a half to gather myself, and was headed in a good direction when I met my recent ex. 

My ex and I did have physical altercations that I can count on one hand, due to me losing control but were nipped indefinitely because I had to find a different way to get across my feelings and emotions. With everything negative I made a conscious effort to realize why it was toxic and worked to improve them until it was fixed. 

There were promises I didn’t keep especially as far as getting my finances in order, or getting a better job, and eventually she got tired of it. I understand all of that. I don’t think she understands the state of mind I’ve been in, I think I’ve been in a state of depression for quite some time now and it’s affected my motivation and drive. Although I wasn’t necessarily taking care of myself I still made sure she was ok even if I gave my last. 

She broke up with me a year ago however we continued communication, still doing the same things we did before the breakup.. including intimacy. Our last argument was beginning of January when she does what she always does, tells me she has to get back to L.A. because she has something to do, but leaves it up for questioning what it is that she has to do. 
I know I’m not entitled to know but I feel like there was always this double standard of me being completely transparent about my whereabouts when asked, but with her it’s none of my business or she would get upset and say I’m being controlling when questioning her. 

I called her a b*tch amongst a few other words for telling me that she had plans in cutting me off completely once she made it back home, but prior to this argument everything was ok. Not long before that day we just got back from spending the Christmas and New Years holidays with my family. 

I apologized to her after things cooled down but nothing has been the same since, she still has me blocked and calls me blocked from her phone, I have to do the same. We started emailing so that has been our form of communication. She’s constantly reminding me that she will not get back with me, but I know the reasons she has are all things that are in the process of being fixed, they have been in the process of improving and being fixed.

She admits she doesn’t have patience like I do, I just want her to understand that I will continue to fight for her. I know she has her own things she’s dealing with and I truly believe it’s clouding her from seeing that I truly do care for her, will always be there for her and love her. I’ve shown if nothing else.. that much to her. 

It’s tough to just let it go because something inside of me knows what can be but I’m the only one who seems to be fighting for it, and it can be exhausting but I’m fighting for someone I love and truly enjoy life with. She makes me better, she truly makes me happy, and hell maybe I’m even addicted to this woman but I don’t believe that’s such a bad thing when you love a person. 

I’ve been really down and haven’t felt ok. Should I give her space to figure herself out? I’m afraid if I give too much space things will fade, or she may feel like maybe I don’t care as much as I say I do. She obviously wants space or else she wouldn’t have me blocked with her number changing on the 21st of this month. 

What would you do? Continue trying to show the person you love them and you want them back, or let it go and allow the person to come to you when they realize that you did truly love them all along, things just became complicated with the depression that overcame you.

64,"So I've had chronic issues with sleeping due to anxiety, tried seeing my GP to get some sleep pills without opening up about anything, but the good doctor saw through my bullshit. For about a year and a half now I believe I've been suffering from Pure-Obsessional OCD, violent and disgusting intrusive thoughts keep me from going to sleep and from concentrating. I've managed to combat much of it on my own without qualified help, but my GP cracked me open and got me to open up about most of it.

As a sample while he's referring me to an actual psychiatrist, he prescribed me with a month and a bit's supply of citalopram, which I've been taking for exactly 16 days now. I realise it takes about 4-8 weeks to begin working properly, but recently I've begun feeling more paranoid about my thoughts, they fill more with more guilt and dread than usual, it's getting harder to push them aside.

65,"So my friend (“S”) is very depressed and really needs help, but her parents refuse to do anything about it. Any advice would be really great. Note: She isn’t in danger of self harm or suicide but still needs help, just not the 911 kind

I’ve known S since 8th and we are both freshmen now and we regularly talk and text. Since about halfway through 8th grade I noticed that she was (to some degree) depressed. For about a year or so, S has been confiding in/talking to me about how she feels, and both of us are positive that it’s depression. (She hasn’t been formally diagnosed but she defiantly some kind of help). like I said i’ve been through a lot with depression and even self-harm: About 2 years ago I started on medication and therapy, and thanks to that i’ve never been better. So think I know enough to recognize when someone needs help. That being said, I’m not any kind of professional, and S really needs some who knows to help her. I’ve been tried to get try her to go into therapy or something like that, because I know how much it can help, and I know how much she needs it. S can go from perfectly fine one minute to breaking down. She talks a lot about how empty, sad, tired, overwhelmed and useless she feels. She’s said many things along the lines of, ”I hate everything about myself,” “Everything I do is pointless,” “I’m a burden,” “I’m not worth your time,” things like that She’s frequently has “Episodes” where she cries and doesn’t want move, or texts and/or talks to me about things like the ones I mentioned. They eventually pass and I’m usually able to talk her out of it. But that can take a long time, and I’m not always able to be to talk or be there, not to mention that i’m not at all qualified or equipped to handle situations like this. To sum it up, S is clearly struggling badly and really needs help. Not only am I not able to give her that help, her parents are actively stopping her from getting it.

Even though her parents are fully aware that S is very depressive, they refuse to do anything about it. And S has always had a somewhat shaky relationship with her parents. Once in early September 2018, S had a full on breakdown right before 9th period. It was by a staff bathroom in one of the far halls, and S was curled up and quietly sobbing. It was almost 2 or 3 minutes before I could talk to her again. I eventually convinced her to go to the social workers office (which is a great thing for a school to have) to meet with and talk to one of them. We walked together to the class she would’ve gone to, because passing period had ended a while ago. Her teacher gave us both passes so she could go to the social worker and I could get to my class without being absent. S stayed there for the rest of the period, and when I texted her she said that they called her dad in and he was talking to the school. The next day when I asked her how it went, she said that the school strongly recommended therapy, (they can’t force you to) but her dad wouldn’t even consider it. When she go home, S and both her parents got into a huge argument. She never told me what they exactly said, but they thought it was somehow her fault or didn’t believe her and that there was some yelling. She said that whenever she brought it, both refused to talk about it and the she had given up trying to get help from them. I’ve been trying to convince S to get counseling with a social worker, but she say that she doesn’t have the time and doesn’t want another fight with her parents. Basically, S needs help, but her won’t get it and she can’t get it herself without her parents knowing and getting mad.

Overall, my problem is that my friend is depressed and needs help, but her parents wont let her. Her parents refuse to get her any kind therapy, counseling, medication etc. She can’t get any from the school because she’s worried about them finding out. I can’t call 911 because she isn’t in any physical danger (From herself or anybody else.) I’ve thought about CPS, but I think a big change like that would be bad since she’s already very fragile. Besides, I don’t think her parents are doing anything legally wrong. But neither are completely off the table and I’m ready to do either. She’s already doing badly, and i’m worried it will get worse. I have no idea what to do and could really use some help. Even if you don’t think it will help, any advice or opinions would be great. Thanks for reading, hope you’re doin’ ok.

To put things in to context, I am 17 and I do quite well at school but this is because I worked extremely hard to get the results I did. During the holidays, I secluded myself in my room and told myself to make sure I work hard and most importantly, don’t be arrogant. I cant think of anything I hate more than arrogance and this is where the problem started.


Now that schools started, every time I do anything, every time I enter a classroom, I hear the complete opposite of what I want to. My brain tells me that I’m the best person in the room; the exact thing I spent two months obsessively avoiding. I have to actively tell these thoughts to go away but its getting to a really bad point. 

I love working hard and thinking about stuff and I know that the only reason I have done well is because I’ve worked hard. It’s impossible to do this when my brain is constantly telling me that what I’m doings amazing as this holds me back from pushing myself.

Im gonna try to explain how I feel. This post may be dumb, because I feel like Iam retarded in all the ways possible.

I suffer from a bad case of OCD , im socialy anxious in a weird way, im body dysmorphic, had a few types of eating disorders, addictions and im just plain dumb and immature.
But whats the worst is that lately i treat people like shit. If i make a friend and they hurt me in a little small way, i block them out, like literally block them on messenger apps. But thats not it, if i start feeling lonely i unblock them and talk to them again till a minor inconvenience happens and i get all retardedly angry and block them again.

86,"Hi, so I usually smoke weed everyday to stay calm.  I've cut down on this a LOT recently (to pretty much nothing) as I can't afford it and have found that my sleep suffers when I don't have it.  Last night I was up until six am without trying to but what was really weird were my thoughts.

I was thinking in a very dark, melancholy way (had been bored and depressed through the day) but also extremely fast. 

I was having a conversation with myself in my head that flowed perfectly well and articulately, saying something along the lines of 'just keep trying to do the things that aren't working in different ways, but if they don't work then life is meaningless anyway and death can be painless so you can just kys if it all goes to shit'.  My brain was also providing flawless counterarguments and was clear in a way my head rarely is, but it was like my brain was talking to itself rather than any manual thought. I wasn't TRYING to think or talk, you know? 

I was able to look at all of my problems and solutions.  While my thoughts sound fairly dark/suicidal, I was viewing them perfectly logically and rationally and I was not in any crisis or danger to myself.  In fact, I felt absolutely nothing at all.  I even remember looking at my fiance in bed sleeping and thinking, 'I don't feel anything at all for you right now'.  Though, I also oddly felt on the verge of crying. 

I also had some weird, paranoid thoughts but I don't remember what they were though I was able to recognise that I was thinking in a very strange way.  For example, when I heard a pipe bang, instead of thinking 'oh the boiler's on' my brain went, quite simply and formally, 'there's fire in the walls'. 

I felt incredibly stimulated and awake as if I'd had a line of coke and my eyes were almost stuck wide open. I did have an instant coffee at 9pm on an empty stomach but I have a very high caffeine tolerance so this shouldn't be the only thing affecting it come 6am!  I also had notably dilated pupils even in my bright bathroom after bathing for 30mins in light.  I have not taken any drugs recently and I'm not on any medication. 

Why did this happen?  I really do feel I flipped on an introspection switch and I'd like to know how to do it again; though perhaps with less disturbing thoughts and not at 6am LOL

Also I got really creative before sleep and drew this weird eye/teeth/pattern thing ",08Feb2019,1

I have very negative, very self-destructive thought patterns that keep persisting in my brain. I noticed that I think about dying or killing myself on a daily basis. And this is what I think about when I'm going to sleep. This actually makes me peaceful. Depressed, unhappy, self-loathing, but peaceful.   


I realized that this is *normal* to me, and I find it *not normal*.

&amp;#x200B;

Once I even did an exercise - I wanted to fall asleep thinking of positive outcomes, doing positive affirmations and visualization. It was really, really difficult. It was an effort for me and my brain, it made me restless and agitated. It's like I suddenly started doing some mental gymnastics in the middle of the night.  


I realized, that I desperately need to change my thought patterns. My subconscious is too polluted with destructive, suicidal thoughts. My thoughts are centered around hiding, escaping from reality and despising society, instead feeling more love.   


I don't really know which method is good. From time to time, I try meditation, or visualizations. The latter are very difficult ones. I often listen to hypnosis sessions from youtube, but I don't really know whether such hypnosis have any effect.  


Can anyone please share a good, well-informed advice, or a method, I could use to change the tracks of my train of thought and keep it from derailing?  


I know that saying ""My life depends on it"" is cheesy, but... considering my recent suicide attempts I would say, yes, my life does depend on it.

93,"When I was younger, since I can remember myself, I have been having these moments or episodes, where one phrase I said or thought just a moment before gets repeated and stuck in a loop inside my mind. For example, if I asked my mother: ""What are we going to eat, Mom?"", the same phrase would be repeated again and again inside my head, just my voice asking again and again: ""*What are we going to eat, Mom?*"" inside my head. Or even if I thought of something, like: ""*What time is it?*"" it would again be vocalised again and again inside my head. And along with this, there would be the feeling of cold sweat, although I don't remember ever actually sweating. Along with this feeling, I would be extremely focused on what I was doing, be it playing or watching TV or anything, sort of inside a bubble where nothing could interrupt me or even come close to interrupting me. And I had this feeling that everything started physically centering towards whatever I had my attention to, sort of like when at the end of a film, the screen gradually gets more black apart from a small circle focusing on something, like the protagonist's face. But, I was so focused that, while it made perfect sense to me to carry forward doing whatever I was doing, the content of that thing I would be doing lost part of its sense, a lot like when you repeat a word over and over again and it starts losing its meaning.

&amp;#x200B;

As I grew older, those ""episodes"" became less frequent, but a couple of nights ago I had one more. I was lying in bed and, as I always do, I was listening to music before sleep. Suddenly, I had this feeling that my mouth was as big as my whole head. So, instead of a face with a nose and two eyes and hair etc., I had just one big mouth. And of course I knew that this was in no way real, but I couldn't shake the feeling that my mouth was as big as my head. And I tried explaining it to myself, just having a sort of conversation with myself that this isn't real. And that became the vocalised loop. Phrases like: ""you are only feeling as though your mouth is as big as your head"" kept repeating inside my head, but this time not only a single phrase, more like the whole *theme* of this ""conversation"" with myself. And when I tried to break out of this loop, I felt a significant discomfort and the delusion became multi-faceted. Along with the head-proportioned mouth delusion, I had also the feeling where I would feel as though my arms were tiny under my normal-sized pillow (I always sleep face-down with my arms under the pillow). After a while, I can't tell how much time passed but it was certainly less than an hour, this episode gradually fainted away and I drifted into sleep.

101,"My boyfriend and I live together and are both currently in treatment for our own mental struggles. We were each written esa letters by our doctors in late 2017.  We adopted a cat because my former apartment allowed cats, and the one we moved into also allows cats. At the time, we didn't have the time to commit to a dog, nor did we want to rock the boat with the apartment(s). His doc recommended we use his letter when moving into the new place to establish the cat as an esa so if they changed their policies, they could not ask us to leave or get rid of her. So we did, and they fought back and it took them weeks to finally tell us ok fine you can move in. Mind you, this was all done via a real estate agent.

&amp;#x200B;

My boyfriend and I have been going through tough times personally, and both of our providers have suggested we consider getting a dog to help us further, especially because my boyfriend's childhood dog will soon be leaving us. We're more financially stable now and have a larger place, so we are seriously considering it. 

&amp;#x200B;

In December, the complex was sold to new owners. We don't have direct contact with them, but do have an on-site property manager who handles rent and communication. We noticed he and another tenant had gotten dogs, so we asked him if they were allowed now. He told us they are, but each apartment has a 1 pet limit and our cat counts, so we can't get one. Worth noting here that previously, there was a 2 cat limit, so many tenants have 2 pets as it is. Our esa also shouldn't be applied to the new ""pet policy"" but that's just splitting hairs.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, we've been thinking more and more about it. We decided we don't want to get a dog just to get a dog, but if the right one comes along, we want to move forward with it. Lo and behold, a rescue I'm in contact with found a fit for us, and he's arriving next week. So now I want to put in a request for reasonable accommodation.   


How do I proceed with this? Do we email the property manager with our request, and offer to provide my letter if they'd like to have it? Can we state that this is time-sensitive and we are requesting accommodation starting next week?? My concern is that they won't get back to us before the dog arrives. Adopting the dog isn't a sure thing – we're going to meet it first and go from there. But if it's a match I don't want to hit a bump in the road and potentially lose our shot because we can't take him home immediately. ",08Feb2019,1

Working for part time jobs that don't last, barely being able to afford going out, not being with people altogether for weeks at a time, always have to hear ""we don't have enough"" when it even comes to allowance (sometimes, i admittedly end up borrowing from other people and paying them back when i can), and i can't even get a single compliment for any hard work i do in school (which sounds bratty, i know, but when you always hear from this friend all the time, you can't help but be envious.)

i can't even get much of a compliment from me, myself. i hate myself. i can't, for the life of me, come to like myself at all, much less love myself. At least i don't see it right now...

honestly? i... hated it... when that well-off friend told me to love myself first then everyone else will. I'm not the one constantly surrounded by people who willingly throw compliments at her everyday. I work for the shit i get. Where I'm from you. don't just fall into such a crowd. Yet i get the short end of the stick. 


i can't help but compare. i can't help but be jealous. i can't help but be lonely, nor can i avoid hating myself. i was also given advice to ""hang out with myself"". I would, if 'myself' wasn't an asshole who constantly made me think of things i hated thinking about. 
""welcome to the club"" I've heard that too.. but.. it sucks always feeling this way.. 


any advice...? 
(please do forgive any tones of brattiness.. i meant to say things without filter to be the most accurate to myself as i can be..) 
im just.. desperate to get/find some help for this...

106,"My boyfriend suffers from depression and anxiety. Recently, he lost his job and that seems to have sent him on a downward spiral. Every day he gets so angry at himself to the point where he will punch himself in the face or cut his arm. He has been throwing things against he wall until they break and kicked my cat last week when the cat tried to play with his feet. 

I’m at a loss. I have the same mental illnesses but can not wrap my head around this anger. It’s terrifying me. He won’t check himself into an inpatient facility and his old therapist is no longer working so the process to get another one is long. I’m afraid he is going to hurt himself badly, or hurt me. I want to help him get better but I don’t know if I should stay in this environment. 

Any suggestions? ",08Feb2019,1

It makes me happy to see her getting better. Unfortunately, I've nearly convinced myself that helping her is more important than helping myself. I'm using the thought process that she's been doing it longer than me, so I should put her first, and that I still think that I should suffer. I seem to care more about her than I do about myself. I'm feel as if I'm slowly getting back into the habit because of this 'more important than me' mentality, I've already cut twice in the past two days. What should I do?

108,"Hi guys.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if this is the right sub to post this but it was the first thing that came to mind. The past couple of days have been completely different from how I usually feel/act and I can't figure out what to do. I like to think I'm a funny sociable guy that likes to work hard but recently even doing simple things like eating or going to class have been difficult for me to do. A lot of my friends have noticed something different too and say that I shouldn't stress so hard, but I'm not sure if that is what's wrong. I find myself avoiding talking to people that I like to consider very close - whether it is family or friends, even though I don't want to. When I talk to my family - who I miss very much as I live away, I try to keep chats as small as possible and hang up. I am struggling to force myself to pay attention to do assignments or study, even though I hold my studies very important to me. I don't play guitar anymore. I tried to search up similar symptoms but I don't know what to do anymore. I've tried reaching out to people to talk about this but I always hesitate since I don't want to be a bother or make people worry. What can I do to fix this? I don't need to know the problem, I just need a solution.

111,"I don’t really know if this is the appropriate place to post but I feel like I need an outside perspective and it’s something that’s hard to talk about around others without feeling like I’m being too much. Here goes, I had to move back in with my parents who don’t have the healthiest relationship (they never really have). I come home to screaming and yelling, things broken, doors slamming etc. and my mom is a narcissist. She’s manipulative and mean. She’ll say awful things and if you try to bring it up later she’ll act like she doesn’t know what you’re talking about. She always makes a point to include me somehow in all of the fights. She’ll come in my room and make my dad out to be the enemy. (Ex: Look what he’s doing to me) I do my best to be neutral, act like I don’t care and disengage but am having a hard time dealing with it. I’m frustrated by the fact that I shouldn’t have to tell her she shouldn’t be coming to her child for this. That I can’t be their mediator and that’s not even a fair thing to ask. They used to tell me and my little sister they were going to get a divorce when we were younger and made us choose who we wanted to live with. This happened several times until we stopped caring. They still haven’t gotten one. I was probably about 6 or 7 when I walked into my parents room and saw my dad hurting my mom who screamed call 911, so I did. My dad took the phone and bent my arm all the way back almost breaking it. I want to be clear nothing physical like that has happened since I was a child. Not to me or my mother. It’s all psychological war now. I moved out on my own and had to come back for financial reasons. So it’s been a bit better because they can’t hold things over my head money wise or stop me from going anywhere anymore since I’m an adult. Although I did get a very stern talking to for leaving without my room being spotless and my bed not being made several times. She checks, and sometimes things are physically moved to different spots so I know she goes through my things when I’m gone. I guess my question and the thing I’ve been struggling most with is, coming from this whole back round and having learned and dealt with so much emotional and psychological abuse how am I ever going to have a normal relationship? I haven’t had that role model couple to look up to I don’t even know what that looks like. I just know overthinking and constantly questioning where I stand to the point where it consumes me every time I want to try with someone. I’ve taken a year off for myself and I just don’t know if any amount of time is going to change that mindset and that’s scary. I still look up to my parents they’re the ones who are supposed to lift you up and love you and the worst part is I’m not even mad. I wish I was. I wish I could scream and yell and throw things and feel better but I honestly think they’re doing the best they can and some people just shouldn’t be parents. I always wanted their approval but could never achieve that so I find myself seeking the approval of others instead but always feel like I give so much more than I get and I’m running out of things to give. Thank you for making it through this long post, any advise is appreciated. Thanks. ",08Feb2019,1

So in short my first workplace was pretty hard and my coworkers made it even harder.

This memory just came out of nowhere while I waited my turn at me post office today. Me and my other coworkers remained just 3 of us. The boss and the doctors went home.

The Girls started to talk about the old times. Olive was an old coworker who retired years ago so i never met her. 
The Girls just casually talked about how Olive once punched Julie (a coworker who i worked with) in the face and said: YOU'LL LEARN THIS TIME.
After that nothing happened. This Olive had a happy oldie life without concequences. And Julie stayed. 
And the Girls just looked at me. One of them just told me:

YES IT HAPPENED AND CONSIDER YOURSELF LUCKY YOU WERE NEVER ABUSED.

I should've just stand up and leave. But i already felt like a POS and trapped. 

I don't want to see them again.

113,"I’m 20, female, in college. I’ve always had what I guess I would describe as obsessive thoughts and impulses. Over the past year or so, they’ve become a lot more invasive and have begun to affect my everyday life.  

I clean my living space obsessively. I live with two roommates who I love, but our shared space (kitchen and living room) can get a little messy. This causes me a lot of stress. I’m on campus for most of the day, and I find myself thinking about how messy/dirty/disorganized our house is and all the cleaning I need to do when I get home. I need to scrub the floor, reorganize the cabinets, clean my shower, wash my sheets, etc. (It’s worth noting that my idea of cleanliness might be a bit distorted, as I don’t think most people would consider our space messy.) I’m also worried this will spiral into an eating disorder because I’ve been falling back into unhealthy habits. I think it’s connected to the cleaning obsession because the feeling is similar; I feel horribly “unclean” unless I engage in these behaviors. 

I don’t know what to do or even if I should do anything at all, because technically I’m not hurting myself or anyone else, but I feel powerless. It’s all so hard to explain and I’m just tired of it. I think I’m mostly just ranting now, but if anyone can relate or has any thoughts I’d love to hear them.

114,"I hope this post is allowed here. I see a therapist on and off (money is tight) but i need to talk about this now. I have borderline personality disorder, depression, ptsd and ocd. I’m currently sleeping with a coke dealer who doesn’t treat me bad but also isn’t exactly lovely, he’s also the closest person i have in my life. I lost my job a few months ago, right after that I had an experience with sexual violence. I was drinking a lot, self harming deeper than i ever have, sleeping all day but can’t afford alcohol anymore so i guess that’s good, and i haven’t cut in a month. 

Basically, I literally fantasise about ruining things even more. You know when you’re like 14 and you want to be fucked up sexy like Effy Stonem or Lana del Rey? it’s almost like that, except suddenly all of the dangerous things are in reach, and i have access and i can do it.  i find romanticisation of mental illness disgusting, so i’m sort of ashamed. 

it sort of starts when i masturbate, it’s just normal thoughts and then suddenly it gets a little out of control. before i know it i’m wanking to the thought of becoming a cokehead ride or die with my shitty coke dealing fwb. i don’t even do coke. 
or i think of how i wish he would hit me so i could feel something. how i wish i could get into a fist fight. how i wish i could go out and get high off my face and break something at a club. 

i’m literally at a point where if i’m like “dude don’t do that that’s such a dumb idea” i laugh at myself and do the thing. on purpose. when i know it’ll get me into trouble/cause an argument/make me look bad. 

tl;dr i’m not sure if i’m making sense here. but i just need to get it out. at first it feels sexy and i want to be fucked up and lose everything (even though it sort of feels like i’ve got nothing left to lose). it gets out of control and i snap out of it and don’t know who i am anymore. it’s like i’m looking for an identity in suffering or something. idk.

Diagnosed with adhd and odd at age 3. Had a terrible time in school, bullied, have shit self esteem etc, tried killing myself age 15 and was finally diagnosed with depression, met a guy when I was 16/17, he was 23, fell in love, he was physically, verbally and sexually abusive (didn't realise this at the time) he wanted to have a child with me, I didn't but he said he'd leave if I didn't get pregnant so I did, within weeks I left him and fell in love with my unborn child.

Had child, diagnosed with ptsd, anxiety, depression, went back into education to try use my experience to help people. 

Fast track five years, I'm in my final year of uni, I'm a mother to an almost five year old little boy who is my whole world. This is the longest I've ever been off anti depressants, they've never worked for me but started a medication for my adhd over a year ago and it's been incredible.

Unfortunately I started using substances every weekend as a means to escape and have done for over two years now, i recently went through another trauma that seen me get sexually and physically assaulted (won't go any further than that) and it was a wake up call.

I'm 6 weeks sober, I'm doing incredibly with uni, I've been seeing a counsellor and she thinks I have an issue with sex, where I use that to escape and for affirmation so I also haven't had sex in 6 weeks. (god damn that's probably harder than avoiding the substances)

Trouble is, I feel so isolated, I've stopped everything, I don't speak to anyone, I came off social media (found reddit woo) my best friend is dealing with a lot herself so is unable to help me through this. My family are amazing but also a lot of other stress. 


I'm being told by my counsellor to try and put the energy I put into other aspects of my life (I always try help people too much where I burn myself out) into myself instead and see what connecting with myself feels like but I'm so FED UP. I'm alone, I want someone, a friend, to be here, to make me laugh, every night I'm on my own, I'm not sleeping, I'm making progress and I know it's going to take a long time but I just feel so shit. I feel so agitated like I need an outlet but I don't know what a healthy outlet is. I've bought loads of mindfulness journal type stuff. But I just cba doing it.

I don't even know what good putting this here will do, I'm just so sad, I've tried ringing three different people but nobody answered, I feel so alone through this whole process and self pity will get me nowhere but I'm ranging between wanting to cry and wanting to put someone's head through a window, there's so much going on internally right now, I just needed a rant 😂

Yeah, any advice on how to be happier being alone, I hate being alone right now, but I kinda have no choice because everyone fucking sucks and I suppose I'm kinda isolating myself also. ",08Feb2019,1
116,"Just a fringe thought so I’ll bullet point my thinking and hopefully you can follow and then give your thoughts. 

The modern era has emerged and natural selection seems all but dead via means of medical interventions. 

The mind has now become the predominant tool in our success, over physicality being favoured in eons past. 

Now mutations are occurring to try and advance the mind. Some are good some are bad. 

Natural selection prevails in evolving the human intellect. 

I say this because I suffer terrible mental health issues. Many diagnosed. I think I’m bipolar which is undiagnosed, but after over a decade out of education (stopping when I was 16), I am now studying Applied Maths and Physics and without trying I am consistently 95%+ in all my modules.

121,"Hello Reddit, I'm a fairly long time user of this site, but I've never posted anything. I've more or less lurked in the shadows just up votting things that I like and read articles that interest me. However, I've recently fallen on rather hard times and I guess you could say that this is somewhat a cry out for help. So, as I sit here in a pub avoiding going home because of the mess that it is I've decided to express myself below in the hope that it may do something to help.

The context: I'm a post graduate student, I live with 2 other friends that I love dearly. One I've known since my undergraduate degree and another I met on my graduate course close to two years ago. Last year we suffered a tragic loss of a close friend who passed away by committing suicide. The circumstances of how and why are not important but, as these things often are, the reason for were mixed with horrors and sadness that made the grieving process that much harder. As we approach the anniversary things with my best friend, the one i met on the course, have only got worse.

I've known friends that have been diagnosed with depression and I thought I'd seen it before, hell I'll even admit that before recent events I naively used to state that I'd suffered from a bout of depression. I now see that I was wrong and what I suffered from in my past was some real terrible down days but I've never seen anything like what I see with my friend now.

I'm going to call my friend Hyde, because quite frankly the change I see in him is something out of a psychological horror. I hope I'm not waffling too much but below I'll try and explain what I experience and then hopefully maybe this forum could do something to give me any guiding tips on how I can help him. My best friend and flat mate, Hyde, has had issues with depression in the past. Before I knew him he tells me that he tried to get help from the doctors before. He had just started uni, he bucked up the courage to go to his GP, no small task I might add, and he told her how he felt. She asked him to fill out a questionnaire on how sad he felt. She sat in silence while he filled it out and not a word was spoken between them. He then sat in silence as she marked his form. She tutted and said ""yes, you do seem sad"" and instantly prescribed him anti depressants and offered group therapy sessions... If one ever needed a reason to doubt the state of the NHS right now I ask you to look no further than that example. What a horrible and ridiculous thing to offer a young and depressed 19 year old, group therapy!! ridiculous! Anyway, unsurprisingly he didn't attend. But he did try the drugs.

Now, the evidence is already weak on the efficacy of SSRI's and well they don't do jack shit if you don't address the underlying issues. They do, however, give you an array of shitty side effects, namely impotence. And really, what's a better way to sink a man into further depression than ensuring in those few moments where he might find escape within the warm embrace of a partner than making sure he can't get an erection.

Anyhow, I tell this story because the context is key. Despite our chats he refuses to go to therapy and refuses to try any medication. My thoughts, on medication are with him, however, i don't agree that therapy has no place for him. I understand now why he hates both.

So how has it progressed? Well, over the past year I've watched Hyde have two states of being. One is his normal upbeat charismatic, funny, loving self. The other is this catatonic, cannot talk, devoid of any emotion self. I think what terrifies me is that he's not sad, nor angry, nor tearful. he's just nothing. He can't talk, he can barely move. It breaks my heart. These days were infrequent at the start and with the tragic passing of our friend I though that it was understandable. But here I am a year later, sat in a pub, talking to the internet because I don't want to go home and see my friend slumped in a chair not able to make eye contact with me. The ""down"" days are getting longer and more frequent and I now realise that every time he goes down, he doesn't really come fully back. I seem to lose a bit more of him each time and there's nothing I can do to stop it. I've had personal experiences of mental issues in my family so I know some stuff, I don't blame him nor do I hate him for how he behaves. But i've never dealt with a depression like this.

When he returns, we talk, we talk a lot. 2 months ago he couldn't see anything was wrong with him. At least now I hear him express that he knows he's not right. But he thinks he's a ""defunct human"" and there's nothing he can do. Credit to him, he works out, he has a schedule, he's a good looking bloke and quite frankly i've never seen a man be so successful with women! So he looks at me and asks what can he do different?!

And I don't know.

He is incredibly negative. When he's down he can't say anything. But now when he's up he says how much he hates himself, he hates the course, he hates everything. He plays sport and he now can't find enjoyment in it. He drinks, we all do. But it now brings no joy to him. He hates himself. Truly and deeply. He feels that he is a drag on all of those around him, sometimes I wonder if his picked up a  book on the clinical presentation of depression with the stuff that he says but it's all there.

So reddit, as a mans at his end, I ask you. How can I help my Best Friend get through the horrible disease that has taken him away from me and us? How can I help a man that doesn't want drugs or therapy. I've done some research and when he says ""he is shit"" i tell him to say that ""he THINKS that he is shit"" because then hopefully it will show him that it is subjective and his interpretation and not fact. He does that sometimes when he's up. Never when he's down. His relationship with his parents is good, but also toxic when it comes to mental health. I don't want to go above his head and talk to them but at the same time what can I do when he refuses to talk to them about it? I'm so scared to come home one day to have found that he's hurt himself. If that's the case I need to do anything I can.

Moreover, this man has absorbed my life. I talk to anyone that I can about it, how boring must I be!? It is wrecking havoc on my relationship. But my best friends health is the main aim here.

Those that have had a similar experience, or had depression. What made a difference to you? And how can I do the same to save my friend?

124,"I feel lonely. 

All the time. 

I don't feel happy either. 

I'm not really good at anything. 

It's a rarity for me to feel comfort at times in my own home. All I hear is yelling in this house. Either by my mother or my parents not shutting up about our pets. Just so much yelling. They call my dog bad things and constantly yell at him and our cats that they proclaim are only mine, even when we rescued and raised them together. 

I get anxious all the time and others are inpatient with my anxiety and I'll sometimes get yelled at for it. Even over the littlest things. 
Even just as small as cooking an egg. It's a force that greatly impacts me and I have tried to control it. 

I feel constantly being watched and it causes my anxiousness, so I have to distract myself with something like listening to music or watching YouTube. I have no hobbies at all. 
I can't go outside due to my parents restrictions on getting kidnapped and what not. Can't even go outside for a walk in this run down neighborhood. My grandparents argue a lot and there's not much to there either, so going next door won't really do anything. 

Being around people and my friends makes me feel less alone and more ""alive"" because I trust them with not being judged and to be instead listened to. However, I don't even safe in my own home to text my friends about my situations because of an incident where my mother took my phone and looked through my business and shamed me for ""making her look bad"" When that wasn't my intention. She deleted half of my photos and my YouTube account. As well as my journal entries.I can't even Google anything ever since she's see my history of lesbian eroticas; which will hint on what's next. 

I'm gay and she knew even before that incident. She was and is still disapproves of my homosexuality. And has pressured me to come out when she was suspicious of my sexuality. Angrily pressuring me, of course. 

Funny thing is, she said she wouldn't look through my stuff and I trusted her. 

Key word, trusted in past tense. 

I don't know how I feel about her or my father for that matter. I really can't say. 

For years I've felt this way, and I tried to show signs of it, but to no avail. I've talked to my mom about it, and she got mad because she couldn't help me and keeps saying she'll look for a psychotherapist (I've been to therapy before and they stopped taking me ever since).  So far, nothing. 

I can't drive, and they haven't taught me more like they said to would and claimed to look into driving lessons but also nothing. I can't physically escape. 

I had a job but quit because I was not in a healthy position to work. My parents didn't want me to work in the first place, and they thought it didn't make me happy. I told my mom I'll call the manager for myself, but instead she did. I was disappointed, because I wanted to do it regardless of my social anxiety.  Especially with phone calls. She even took the phone out my hand so quickly when I was trying to make a call to a website about my school login. 

I have a huge body image/insecurity problem. I don't like looking into mirrors, I don't like pictures of me, and I don't like how my brain makes me think I look big, even though my mom, who's a fitness professional, says I'm thin as it is. It's a huge factor that lowers my self-esteem. I want to do dancing, but I can't even look in a mirror. I want to do radio station hosting, but can't even stand to hear my own voice. I freak out when I see myself in photos and makes me angry. I don't show it, instead I just curse to myself alone.

 I feel like all the discomfort I've felt can make turn bitter at times, when I'm usually a warm hearted person. I don't like to be interrupted during my ""distractions"". I can snap when I don't mean to and all the hysteria I'm in everyday can really turn you into a different person. My friends even said it was scary to see me like that. I'm scared of that opposite me. That's not me. Not me at all. I'm also afraid. 

I don't want to go to college because I know I'm not for it and I'm not college material at all. I can't even handle a college leveled high school class.I'm shamed for this by my parents because I know college isn't the life for me. There are things I can do that doesn't involve college, just what is it? If I know what it is, I hesitate because of either my insecurity or if it'll ever happen. Just like my dreams. 

I can't stand being in the house anymore and I want to be happy. I'm stressed at school with work, and I still feel streseed at home. Its like I feel pressure anywhere I go regardless. At least in school, I can have fun with people. 

Aside from all that, I do this one thing to make me feel somewhat better. Run. Listen to music
Everyday, I get on the treadmill to run. And listen to music.
They're one of the only things in my house that makes me feel better. When you're running, no one tells you what to do and no assignments to be given. Just run. Running makes me feel free and I've never felt more adrenaline in my life. Running while trying not to break into a dance is hard because last time I did, I fell off the treadmill. Whoops. 

The sweat is like a constant pat on the back and is more comforting than anything. I know people hate to sweat, but it's like a security blanket to me. And the words from my favorite  singers/rappers are embodiments of entertainment and encouragement at times. A constant reminder if you will. 
No breaks, I never stop running. 

Just constant running. 

I don't do it to lose weight, I do it for the good feelings. 

Which is a lot better than my thoughts of drinking, doing drugs or smoking that could make me feel better, but just only hurt me more and others around me as well. I'm glad I didn't make those decisions. Especially the near attempt of suicide. That one I will never forget. 

I feel like there's so many things blocking me and it makes me feel imprisoned in my own mind and body. Like some wild animal. Everything. Everything is in my way and I'm trying to break through. Some nights leave me with puffy eyes and yearning for feelings of happiness. And not this hell I'm in. I don't know what to do. I 
 want to feel better. 

All I can do is run and dwell into music. 

What can I do?

125,"So, I scheduled a class trip thing that I need to do for a grade and really needed to be committed to but after much anxiety over what I had to do for the trip and how far away it was (I have a toxic family and financial issues as a result of that so can't afford much gas) the teacher finally just said to not go and to meet up with her to go over my concerns. I've really been meaning to try and get some accommodations for my classes for my anxiety, but the school therapist has been slow to help me out with it and I just have so much to do that I haven't had enough time to look into it much... there's only so much a person can do in a week ... &gt;&lt; I'm just trying my best but now I feel really upset and worried that I couldn't make the trip, like I'm just faking my anxiety so I don't have to go, but I really am quite anxious.....

126,"Over 10 years ago I suffered from total burnout, a mental breakdown which seriously damaged my mental health, my self image / belief and has left me with an almost ptsd type response to anything which generates stress. After this happened I was floored for a couple of years then even when I felt a bit better physically I still didn't have much insight into my situation and what led to my breakdown. Now after a lot of personal self work and sorting out my past I can see that why this happened to me and that it would have happened to pretty much anyone in my situation and that I no longer need to see my breakdown as evidence that I am incapable of achieving anything. However while I understand this now mentally, emotionally or subconsciously I still suffer from overwhelming anxiety, panic and self doubt whenever I attempt to work on any goal that is meaningful to me. I feel like I am in a prison of my past pain and I can't get out.

127,"After taking a full week off from teaching, I changed a lot of things. I go to bed at the same time regardless of how much work I have, I take my time, I go to therapy, I take Prozac (now 20mg) and Xanax when anxiety is really bad. I also close my classroom during lunch which I feel bad about, but I need it. I am not myself, and while my kids might be aware of it, I don’t want them to see me so out of it. I want to be the cheerful happy teacher before my mental health started going downhill again. 

My depression and anxiety worsened as a first year teacher, but the feeling subsided within two weeks. It happened again my second year. This is my third year. I know this pattern wasn’t good, so I’m sticking with the therapy and meds.

My therapist said in the end, it’s my decision what I want to do and to take it one day at a time. I had some good days and was able to gradually get things off my to do list, but this week I’ve been taking Xanax almost daily on my commute to work.

I had to leave school as soon as I dismissed the kids today. I don’t know what’s happening to me. I wanted to get back to the swing of things and I’m all depressed again today. It was one thing after the next today, and I got overwhelmed.

I can’t cope with stress anymore. I get anxious with the principal and administration. I get anxious with some parents. I get anxious when things don’t go well. My chest feels tight and my heart keeps beating. I haven’t taken Xanax because I thought I’d calm down if I just left work. 

I shouldn’t be stressed out right now. I know in my head to start again Monday. Fridays tend to be rough. Take it one day at a time. I tell myself this but my body continues to scream to quit teaching and I don’t know sometimes what to do.

I love teaching. I do. I really do. I love my kids, even the challenging ones. I know I can job hunt for other schools during the summer. It’s just so hard. It’s hard. But every teacher is just as stressed, and they manage it so damn well. I don’t have confidence. I don’t like talking to angry parents. I don’t like observations. I don’t like getting reprimanded in front of kids when I make mistakes. I don’t like last minute paper work. I don’t like meetings that goes on and on.

I just want to close my classroom door and teach. I hate everything else. I hate feeling this way. I hate how my optimism and positive energy is escaping me. I hate relying on medication. I hate becoming someone I don’t like.",08Feb2019,1
128,"Hello, I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety for a long time and things are improving for me. Many of my friends also are suffering from the same problems and I’m taking notice of common behaviours amongst them and myself. It’s as if we’re all acting like little pouting kids that are mad things aren’t going our way. We resent people talking to us and are very closed in on our own worldview. It’s as if it’s a lack of consciousness and self esteem.  Everything has to do with ourselves all the time and we resent or dismiss anyone else.

129,"Every time I ask a question abt my mental health, I seem to get borderline as an answer and when I look up anything that's bothering me, borderline pops up. It's like I can't escape a bpd diagnosis. I've read though the bpd and other personality disorder sections of the dsm-5 and I strongly relate to all of it except the sexual relationships. 

I've been meaning to bring it up to my therapist for half a year and I finally did, but she laughed. She said I couldn't be because I look at things from multiple perspectives and I'm ""the same person"" every time I come in to my apps. She talked abt how her borderline patients will blame her for everything some times and treat her like their best friend other times. I am logical as to why people do things but it doesn't affect my emotions. I felt kind of like she was going off stereotypes for most of her reasoning but I wanted a second opinion.

I really don't want a bpd diagnosis but it makes so much sense and my therapist is still in graduate school so she could be wrong. I have a bd and ptsd diagnosis and I was raised by a borderline/narscisstic mother so I know the odds are higher for me to have it too. 

Tldr: my therapist says I can't have bpd because I don't switch on her and I look at things from multiple perspectives even though everything I experience points to bpd. Is she right or going by stereotypes?

133,"The only time I've seen a GP about any mental health related issue was when I was making myself throw up multiple times a day, this had gone on for a year by then and I was laughed out of the office.


I grew up in a family that rolled their eyes at mental health and find it very hard to talk about with people in person.


For the last two week, I've had almost daily occurrences where something small causes a completely disproportionate reaction in me. 
These episodes involve hysterical crying for 2-4 hours, shaking, feelings of intense desperation and needing to find a way of lashing out and feeling totally out of control. 
My left arm is covered in cuts from the past 10 days. I'm ashamed to say I've made suicide threats which was really me thinking out loud. 

I really don't recognise myself during these patches and feel like I'm stuck in the back of my head watching it all happen screaming ""PLEASE JUST STOP. YOURE RUINING EVERYTHING""


I'm scared my partner will leave me if I don't fix this and I really don't think I can take these intense episodes anymore.

Life if a little stressful at the moment, granted, but ive been stressed before and never experienced anything like this.


Worth noting that the rest of the day I'm sunny and pretty much carefree. And then I crash.

so bottom line, I’ll have to be commuting 1 - 1  1/2 hours away for therapy... is that worth it? i’m not sure if that’s a stretch or if people normally do this ): ",08Feb2019,1
136,"Let me preface this by saying in my current personal situation, I would never go through with it. I’m just trying to figure out if these things are normal intrusive thoughts, or actually warning signs that my mental health is out of wack.

I’d also like to add that I have family history of depression. My father has been diagnosed and taking medication for many years, and his brother struggled with it and killed himself around 20 years ago. 

So where do I start.. (Life story alert 🚨 )

The earliest memory I have to when this “started” was the first day of 7th grade when I was messing around being loud in the line at the end of the day and a female classmate told me to stop being so stupid. I was a “class clown” type kid who was very goofy and somewhat immature but hell, what 7th grader wasnt. Anyways.. apparently this has had quite an impact on my life because today at almost 27 years old I look back and can see that moment clear as day.

Cut to a couple years later; throughout high school I was bullied relentlessly. Every. Single. Day. You name it, it happened. I don’t remember the exact moment it happened but I eventually developed a defense mechanism where I just wouldn’t talk, and if something happened I’d just laugh or ignore it. I was the kid who would come to class, not say a word to anyone, and leave. Kids would joke about me shooting the school up, then proceed with the bullying, because I was a “pussy” and wouldn’t do it.

Graduation day, when everyone was hugging their friends and sad, I was relieved because I never had to go back. I thought my life was going to take a turn for the better.

Reflecting back on this I honestly think my emotional &amp; mental development suffered massively because I basically just shut down down for 4 years and has set me on the path that I find myself on today.

I have damaged personal relationships with friends, s/o’s, and family, and am in the process of ruining my current relationship. For awhile I just... don’t feel like doing anything, feel tired all the time, find myself easily stressed, and as of very recently began getting very irritable and combative(not physically).

I find myself a very boring person, and completely incapable of holding a conversation unless it’s about work. My only interests are playing niche or non-mainstream video games, and listening to podcasts, usually at the same time. When I try to pick up a new hobby or project, I give up easily. I used to play guitar and write music but I can’t even focus long enough to finish one verse before I tell myself this isn’t working and I do something else.

My girlfriend and I had a child last June and he is basically the only thing that gives me joy at this point. If I’m not holding him, I’m legitimately a shell of person just walking through life. And due to an issue with our home, they are staying with her mother until we can find a new place. I have seen him maybe 3 times a week for 20-30 mins for a month now and I am at a new level. I’m fine while I’m at work but the moment I come home... it’s... sad. Like I don’t have words other than just sad. I would never do it, like I said. But I have thought about death basically every day. Not even just suicide, but like... I’ll entertain the thought of me dying and all the things I’ll miss with him, and the thought of it happening while he’s young, and wondering about me. Like it will just pop into my head, and I won’t be able to get it out. 

Then when I’m with him, sometimes he’ll cough or something, and I’ll think what if he’s sick? Then from there I’ll think about how a bunch of kids from around here have died from this uncureable brain cancer recently and I’ll just look at him and get incredibly sad. Which is when the suicide thoughts come.

...

...

...

I just don’t know if I need to speak to someone about how I’m feeling or if I’m just having normal feelings. This isn’t the only time I’ve had these thoughts. Anytime I get into a fight with my gf, or if I feel like I’m not doing a good enough job, I have had many thoughts of how I could do it, but this little boy is so important to me I could never put him through that. I’ve seen my cousin after she found out about her dad and she has made multiple attempts now herself...

I just.. I honestly am concerned that he is the only thought that makes me shut that part of my brain up. Like, it doesn’t feel like that’s healthy.

If anything I don’t think i need a doctor to tell me I have extreme anxiety issues, but the rest idk.. I’m just hoping that maybe someone has had similar experiences and can offer advice.

Thank you

137,"I am going on 30 but I have had major depression and suicidal thoughts since I was about 15.  I've spent my entire adult life ""managing"" my depression by suppressing all emotions under a cloud of ""I don't care"".  Not just happy or sad but really anything in life.  If you asked me for my opinion on any topic I'd probably say I don't care.  Naturally I've completely isolated myself from any real human connections on an emotional level, even my family.


So, I start PHP and opened up a lot to the therapists there, and surprisingly in the group therapy settings as well.  After holding every thing in for so long and lacking real emotional connection it makes sense that it would feel really good to open up towards people who seem like they care and or people who can relate with me.  I would say 2 weeks of PHP was life changing for me, the entire experience of therapy as well as everything I learned CBT/DBT wise and coping skills, etc.


Now, I am about two weeks out and I have continued going to IOP as well as seen an individual therapist but it's all at a different facility, different staff, and I'm just not feeling the same connection here.


I think what I have realized is I didn't learn coping skills in PHP.. they WERE my coping skills.  I am craving that feeling of being able to talk to them again.  I am having increasingly frequent thoughts (fantasies even) about how awesome it would be if I killed myself so I could go back there and see them.  Which, if you stop to think about it for even more than half a second, doesn't even make sense lol.  I don't feel like I have any intentions of actually hurting myself right now but I spend most of my days lately daydreaming about how I can go back.

I decided to seek short term help in therapy to deal with the intense grief I'm feeling from my long term therapy leaving me. 

Anyway, I finally narrowed it down (mostly because I'm tired of looking) to two guys. 

Guy 1 -- older guy, like 70s probably, more strict in his boundaries, 50 min sessions, very knowledgeable BUT he has a longer commute for me and I live where winter can make driving a nightmare. His office is also less inviting/relaxing.... just 2 chairs besides his and his desk. 

Guy 2-- Much younger than me, probably 20s.... very chatty, unsure if he is knowledgable yet as our only session was intake, 45 min sessions, BUT he's a 5 minute commute and his office is relaxing. 

I'm a bit unsure if younger is good, has anyone had a much younger one? Did they seem helpful? 

Neither have any sort of outside contact, which is fine but it kinda of sucks in the sense of me having surgery coming up and potentially wanting to connect during my 3 or so weeks off.

145,"Ok, maybe I need some advice and a place to vent. I started my job three years ago and I absolutely loved it. I got along with my 40 new coworkers. Since all was well, my depression and anxiety would rarely show it’s face at work. Everyone knows I have anxiety because my anxiety is unfortunately apparent but never so bad that it’s a major issue. 

Well, last year, a new guy, Paul* was hired in a department right next to mine but we all share the same area. We started seeing each other. Long story short, he completely ghosted me after two months to start dating his boss. His boss is 6 years older than me and she is a “mean girl.” We used to be close, but she’d talk crap about all the younger girls at work and how I was the least annoying 🙄. She’s a heavy set girl who hides her insecurities by bashing other girls frequently. Anyway, i think she knows now that I had hooked up with Paul a few times because now she’s extra nice to me but has been extra clingy with Paul when I walk by. And she’ll talk about how amazing he treats her when I’m within earshot. And everyone at work gossips and I had told a couple of people that he and I dated. 

I was devastated when he blew me off for her. I really liked him a lot.  I’d have panic attacks at work almost every day because I’d see them sneak to an area behind our building where he and I used to make out. When I’d feel an attack coming on, I’d hide in the bathroom and not let anyone see me. It’s been two months, and for the most part, I’m over him. But the panic attacks will not go away. My boss caught me having one in December. But Last week , I had one so bad that I started crying and trembling so bad in front of my boss. I couldn’t talk or breathe! She was really scared seeing me that way. I have no idea what bought on my attack. It happened on its own. Now, she’s not giving me any work. She doesn’t want me to be seen in front of higher ups (she’ll ask another assistant to sit at my desk and she’ll tell me to go wait in another office when the VP or CEO comes to visit) and lately, all her phone calls have been her whispering. She never cared if I heard her on her phone calls BEFORE. I kinda overheard her saying I can’t handle being in front of people... which is false!!!  I was always a great communicator in front of customers/staff.  

I don’t know if I should look for another job where I’m not treated like a basket case, or if I should suck it up. 

I told her today that I’m an individual and not just a person with anxiety and she kinda didn’t take me serious. She just nodded and went on her way. 😔

Would you stick it out? How do I get them to take me seriously again?

Well last night I opened up and expressed my deep seated sexual desires to be completely dominated, used, abused, and owned by a woman. She did not take that well and got angry at my mother, and at me for not telling her this sooner. Her first reaction was a very strong ""you need to go back to counseling"". The way she handled it hurt me and I told her that, she didn't understand why and was still angry that I hadn't told her this earlier and demanded that I tell her any other deep seated desires or secrets then and there.  At this point , and this is a ""known issue"" with me I clammed up and stopped communicating, instead retreated inside my head with feeling of unworthiness and shame. She told me she loves me and that she isn't going to leave me, which I was afraid was going to happen, but I feel like I don't know what to do or how to act now around her. I feel like it was a mistake telling her about it. She wants me to seek professional help, but I don't know where to go and even with my insurance I don't feel I can afford to see some one that might actually be able to help. So I am turning to the internet, and the glorious people of reddit in hope of an answer or suggestion of what direction to take.

TL;DR: Sorry for the rant, I'll probably delete this later, but the  last few months have been absolute hell on me and I need to vent somewhere 

 My best friend has been in and out of the hospital constantly and has surgery coming up, and I just feel terrible for him constantly, being young and dealing with a disease, but still being a champ, and even listening to my rants and problems.  

Another friend is constantly suicidal, texting me pictures of himself cutting, saying he wants to kill himself. I cant just give up on him, but it's so exhausting mentally to have that happening on top of school, work, and own personal life and emotions.

And the worst of all, my girlfriend broke up with me in December. She was my first relationship, I was head over heels in love with her, and still am. She was the first person I've ever really connected with on a serious level.  Im still fucked up over it because I still love her, and just wish she could be in my life somehow still. I know where I fucked up, and wish I could fix it, or at least apologize and have her not hate me anymore.  I keep telling myself we just met at a bad time in life, it's as weird as the situation we met in. I keep saying she'll give me another shot one day when things are better for us both.  I continue holding onto that hope but it just weighs more and more on me. I want to move on but my heart is stuck on her.

I quit smoking weed shortly after the breakup, because it just reminded me of being with her and got me too in my feelings. And just today broke that, because my dumbass decided trying shrooms for the first time, hoping it would maybe help me find myself.  Ended up smoking, didn't ""find myself"" and now I'm upset with myself.  

All of this has resulted in me becoming EVEN MORE introverted, and my depression coming back really harsh, with my anxiety being at an all time high.  I usually have a ""fake it til you make it"" outward attitude and try to have some confidence in my every day life, but it's been really hard lately and I can feel it taking a toll on me more and more every day. 

Again, sorry for the rant.  I just recently found this sub when looking for some more friendly support subs trying to find advice for my friend.  I just don't have many people to talk to that I don't want to risk driving away anymore than I have.  Anyways, thanks for reading, hope you all have a great day/night ✌️",08Feb2019,1
