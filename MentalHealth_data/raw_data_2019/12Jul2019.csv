0,I've had so many bad experiences with my family that I feel like something is bound to happen again. It's hard to not feel paranoid or worried when you've been defeated so many times in the past. I think my environment at home has a direct impact on how I feel.,12Jul2019,1
1,"To make a long story short. I have always been someone who prefers to be alone and I also have mild anxiety around people which hurt my confidence a bit. I recently finished high school and the last week before getting my diploma I was constantly partying and having the greatest time of my life. I felt free. 

After this, I no longer feel any anxiety at all. I constantly talk to people now for some reason and I hate being alone. I go out to have fun way more than I ever would in my old state of mind, and my confidence is at it's highest! I literally can't feel awkward. 

This feels surreal cause I have never been so happy before in such a long time, and I was wondering if I should be cautious about this sudden change of behaviour because I've never experienced this feeling before.",12Jul2019,2

4,"I want to accept my relationship with someone is over. The person betrayed me greatly but I won’t get into details.

5,"I'm seeing a psychiatrist and I'm unable to go to school anymore. 

I started crying a lot everyday, staring at the ceiling without moving or speaking for hours, being irritable (sometimes aggressive) and feeling empty....

Sometimes I smile and do weird stuff (I even do risky stuff I'm scared to do but I do it anyways), I see myself happy but I'm empty...I do weird faced and movements like a Power Ranger.

I can't help but thinking I'm acting all the time, and think my brain turned against me.

Yesterday I heard my mom talking shit about me with her psychologist (I was manipulating her n such)....I asked my mom why did they say such horrible things about me, and that I didn't know how to stop trying to manipulate her and I was sorry. She told me that they didn't even talk about me or say 'manipulation' even tho I clearly heard my name.

Sometimes I put weird faces and start screaming out of nowhere. I used to think I had a monster inside that wanted to go out but I just realized it's me, frustrated of being unable to speak at all, to express myself in words. I realized it cuz my mom started pressuring me a lot to speak and I just couldn't. I can talk normally after some time.

I also started having conversations in my head with a man who only says terrible stuff. His name is Jaimito and I know I invented him unconciously but sometimes I get scared cuz I think I think I'm starting to think he's real.

I also have trouble thinking that what I think is not what I actually think and that I think otherwise but I can't figure out what I'm actually thinking.

6,"My wife suffers from psychosis induced by depression. I've always noticed these really subtle beliefs that just didn't make sense but I never pushed back on her beliefs because they were mostly harmless.  But this time her delusion is that I am a threat to her safety. I've always been very supportive. I am not perfect. And have made mistakes. Those mistakes are now being twisted by her psychosis, and exaggerated. Now she fears me.  I've never hit her or threatened to hit her but she thinks that I never hit her because she prevented me from hitting her by her calming me down. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have experience with plausible, non-bizarre delusions?

Do the delusions persist even after medication has taken hold? 

After the medication has taken effect - Has anyone had success convincing a loved one that their belief was a delusion?

7,"When I first started counselling with this lady, I signed some papers and she asked me what I wanted to improve on, in which I said I wanted to find ways to fix my depression and anxiety, but mostly for depression because it’s my biggest struggle. Out of all my appointments with her - about 8-12 sessions, I found no satisfaction in them every time I finished the appointment. Every appointment basically started out with her asking me how I’m doing, what I’ve been up to since I last saw her, anything fun or interesting I’ve been doing and then she’d ask me what my depression has been like. Every time she asked me what I’ve been doing the past couple days or weeks since I last saw her, I always say nothing because that’s exactly what I’ve been doing - nothing. Clearly, I was not improving at all. I did have some “victories” like waking up in the morning and going to school more often (which is something I struggle with a lot), going to bed on time and not staying up all night, and finding hobbies or things I enjoy. But honestly, these “victories” were something I achieved myself and had no impact on me from counselling. In fact, I was constantly failing to maintain my sleep schedule, going to school everyday, and finding hobbies. I eventually burnt out because of doing these things and I have been trying to do them for years without guidance of a counsellor. All my counsellor did was ask me these questions and I’d start ranting about my issues but I never felt like anything was improving when I said these things. She just gave me pieces of paper with info on depression and anxiety and then I would leave her office. I never read these sheets because I’m too unmotivated to do so and I’d rather have someone verbally help me out instead of having to read info on paper. I could easily get the info online with some simple googling...

Anyways, is my counsellor a bad choice? I just cancelled my service with her today because I got no where with her truly.",12Jul2019,2
8,"Hi , I am a 15 years old boy I had a problem this year which was I went to highschool where  I know no one (except 1 girl) I wasn't good at making new friends so I was always alone once I got invited to a group message of our class I browsed through the old messages found that that girl said I had schizophrenia that affected me so much since I liked here I don't know if I exaggerated that but since that everything changed I got into gore stuff and I always liked to be alone I began to make suicide jokes basically I turned edgy as u might call I over reacted to everything after that but sometimes I watch gore stuff and feel poor for the guys in the vids which is unusual since I always laughed to that stuff once I over reacted to some problem with my parents they yelled at me I did the same they said ""see how games made u like"" I play games maybe so much cuz I had my only friend left there I am only  able to make contact with people only online that s why I never told my parents .
I am not poor or rich, but there's a problem my father doesn't work after a problem in his job (lawyer) since I was young he is always at home so when my friends before I moved to secondary school ( sorry that s how we call it on my country ) noticed that and asked me about it I couldn't answer them they made jokes even in public but that didn't matter for me that much .

11,"I really would love to see a more open conversation about suicide, suicide ideation and the desire to die emerge in the coming years. We haven’t really made a distinction between the subtle nuances within the mind/emotions that often lead to actual suicide, but perhaps if we could explore the thinking patterns more deeply without jumping to call the suicide hotline, the desire to die within the human heart/mind could morph into something with more intelligence, creating its own meaning and enhancing our lives. Could the basic desire to die have meaning that is valuable beyond an individual emergency situation?

Suicide isn’t just one single experience that is the same for all people. It’s a myriad of experiences that need to be defined as such. I spent many years studying the Tibetan Buddhist philosophical system, and one thing that will always stick with me is that we never talked about anything without first defining our terms. For instance, they have specific definitions for mind, awareness, and consciousness that all slightly differ. We never used the terms interchangeably. I think that this approach could really help in broaching the topic of suicide. For instance, can suicidal ideation be different from the desire to die, each with a distinct set of defining characteristics? Can someone has a “desire to die” at the present moment be differentiated from a “suicidal” person?

I for one know that as soon as I mention a desire to die, the person (therapist or otherwise) instantly closes the conversation and goes into emergency mode. But that’s not what helps. I want to talk about it intelligently. I want to ask questions. I want to describe the imagery I am experiencing. I want to be free to share my experience without the “protocol” people have been taught. It’s like death, and specifically suicide, is the one thing we are not allowed to explore in dialogue with others, but I’m sure anyone whose committed suicide (or tried) would tell you that they had no one to talk to. That they felt left behind and misunderstood. That they wanted support rather than rejection. That they felt unheard. Can we try to understand better?

Suicidal thoughts, ideation, having a desire to die—these are all NORMAL responses to an extremely imbalanced world, and for some, an extremely traumatic life. I would even argue that these are just natural human thoughts and desires. Actual suicide results (in part at least) from our ignorance of these topics and inability to face them as a community. We sweep all the momentum leading up to a suicide under the rug, expecting the person to figure it out. Just snap out of it, we say: It’s not until they’re “serious” and have made a threat that we are ready to talk about it, and really, the only messaging we have is, “don’t do it. It’s not worth it. You are valuable.” But we aren’t really backing up those claims in action.

I really hope to normalize the conversation someday so that we can begin to talk about what truly works for a mind that is fraught with the desire to die or suicidal ideation, which I think is the beginning of the suicide cycle. It’s like addiction specialists trying to help a drug addict, never having tried a single drug themselves, not to mention not experiencing serious childhood trauma. It doesn’t work very well. For those of us that know what it feels like to want to die, the systems currently in place for suicide prevention are similarly flawed. It’s a black and white approach to a very complex individual experience.

For anyone reading this that’s having a hard time, I hear you! I’m sorry that society hasn’t made space for your experience. You are the key to a solution. You are meant to be here for each and every moment that you are here, and I am grateful for your insight, your strength, and your perseverance. 

It is up to us to do better, so let’s do that.",12Jul2019,17
12,My girlfriends and my dog passed recently and I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like it was my fault because I wasn't quick enough and can't stop thinking about him or sleep. It was unexpected he had no health issues before hand and was 6. By the time I got him inside the hospital he was already gone he died in my arms. They told me it was most likely a heart issue that was undetected. Life is bullshit. If there's a god fuck him.,12Jul2019,1
13,"I've noticed this before but thought maybe I was too young to fully process it or something, but now I'm a fully grown mid-20s adult and it still feels the same.

I did not cry when my grandparents died (when I was aged 8, 15, 21). I did not cry when my first pet died (I was 19). Or my second (I was 22); or the 3rd who died unexpectedly on the anniversary of the 2nd (I was 23).  

I feel emotions - don't get me wrong. I get very emotionally involved in romantic &amp; sexual relationships. Perhaps too much. I've cried a lot when serious relationships have ended. 

But when someone or something close to me dies...I just kinda deal with it and move on? I don't know if I just rationalise it and in my head go ""well...everyone dies. I guess we had a good run."" But it's very difficult to understand when everyone around me is in tears and sad for weeks after the fact while I just get on with my life.

I know some people mourn different and the stages of grief take different times depending on the individual...but I just kinda seem to go through them all in about 20 seconds. 

I'm not really sure what I'm asking. I guess I just feel weird and like I should feel something that I just don't. It's not like I wasn't fond of these people or the pets. I admired my grandfather in particular, and saw him as a role model. But I still didn't cry when I found out he died. Admittedly - I'm not one who is obsessed with their pets, but equally I do spend time playing with them and attending to them. It's not like I ignore their existence so it has no tangible impact on me.",12Jul2019,8

15,"Don't know if this is relevant or not, but I was diagnosed with ""mild"" ADHD when I was in middle school. I have been medicated ever since and it has worked out great. I am a generally happy person and what I am about to explain does not stop me from functioning as an adult. I am just wanting to fix a problem before it worsens (If there is one).

&amp;#x200B;

I have noticed that I kind of get into weird ""modes"" of thinking, and I have a hunch that it may be more than just ""me being a little frustrated or down today"". Over the past couple month I have watched closely how I feel, what I am thinking and how I go about things. The past 2 weeks I have felt great. I have been excelling at my job and been having positive experiences and time spent with my family/friends. In that time span I felt confident, inspired, motivated, happy etc. It is hard to explain the feeling, but I just feel very confident in myself, where I am going in life, and I didn't have a worry in the world. I just felt like me.

&amp;#x200B;

But lately, I have been getting overwhelmed/confused with my work. A lot of times it is just me overthinking things and then getting frustrated and disappointed in myself because I feel incompetent. I find that in this state of mind, I believe in negative ideas about myself. I say ""believe"" because it isn't like I have any explicit negative thoughts like ""You suck, you don't know what you are doing"", I rather just automatically base my actions and thoughts off of the idea that I am intellectually inferior or incompetent (which I logically know is not the case, it is just how I feel). I will then get irritable towards others, less talkative, and usually just want to be left alone. I have noticed that there are things that trigger it, and it is usually when I find that I had a misunderstanding about a topic or said something incorrect.

&amp;#x200B;

So I usually find myself in one of those two states of mind. The first being confident about myself, not worrying about how I measure up with others, passionate about life, etc. The second being self doubting, getting overwhelmed easily, overthinking things, etc. I switch between these ""modes"" fairly frequently, each usually lasting around 1-2 weeks. To reiterate though, it doesn't stop me from functioning. I am able to keep push all of that ""mental weight"" away, but I just want to feel the feelings in the first state of mind more often, because it feels great and things are better like that! So any thoughts/suggestions on this? Should I go talk to a therapist about it?

TL;DR: I have noticed that my mood will change between two ""modes"" of thinking every so often.",12Jul2019,1

22,"Hi Guys

So it’s been 3 and half years I have been going through what I am about to explain below. I have never been able to swallow up the courage to ask for help or get advice as I found it an extremely distressing and traumatic experience.

So when I was younger, around 12 years old I remember masterbating and half way through for a split second I thought that the women slightly resembled my mother. I didn’t think of it at all in that way and finished without even the intention of what it may seem. So fast forward 7 years and I’m at university, baring in mind that not one time beforehand I had recollected about that experience and I get extremely drunk. If you knew me personally you would know I have like to joke about pretty much everything and I find almost everything funny. I ended up saying to my University friends that night that i masterbated over my mum and tried making it out as a joke. The thing is I don’t even know how I remembered something like that when I literally never even thought about it until that night, however, this is where it all goes down hill. 

So, I woke up the next morning with an extremely bad hangover and I FaceTime on off my university friends, which we always done after a night out. I noticed and realised straightaway that something was up. So for the next few weeks I sat there and tried recollecting what happened that night and I finally came to a conclusion on what I had done/said. At this point because of all the drugs and drink I was taking I was getting extremely paranoid and anxious. Fast forward to summer time after that year of university and I was back home on a night out with one of my best friends and I told him, that I’m having a bad time at university at the moment and explained what happened when I was 12 and I made a joke out of it. He asked if I did actually do it and I replied saying ‘no’. I then return to university for freshers and built up the courage to tell one of my flat mates it was a joke when we was on a night out, because at this point I was so depressed/paranoid and anxious about the situation. He then went on to say, that he didn’t believe me and I definitely done it. This lead me to never bring it up again and stay quite about it until a couple of weeks ago. 

It got to Christmas and could pick up a tense vibe around my friends from back home, one night they tried setting my up to get stabbed because my so called “best friend” from back home told all my mates and they assumed that it sounded like I did it even though I told him I didn’t. My paranoia was through the roof after this, as now I couldn’t trust anyone and I thought everyone was out to get me, I started to block contact with everyone and only speak to a few people. This made me super depressed and suicidal and I tried killing myself twice because I thought everyone was against me and what I had done was wrong. I tried killing my self in two days and spent three days in a hospital, when asked by the psychiatrists what was wrong I didn’t dare bring it up. 

It then got to to the point where one of my housemates at university who said I was like the brother he never had, told everyone about it and no one hearing my side of the story just believed it. I was abusing cocaine daily at this point and drinking almost every day to block out the thoughts. I was so paranoid at one stage I could hear voices almost everyday speaking about it, I never left my room because I felt so ashamed for something I never done. It lead me to believe things that I didn’t do, and I even started experiencing physosis etc. I started debating with myself if the dreams I were having actually happened and I was putting things in to my head and believing them.  I got to the end of university, and my mental health at this point was rock bottom, I somehow managed to finish university with a 2:1 and I moved back home. Literally everyday this was on my mind and I haven’t been diagnosed but I swear I have OCD now about it and/or some sort of PTSD.

I then moved country to get away from my problems but now since I have been out here I know you can never do that. I finally want help and have been researching about it, and it’s not what everyone makes it out to be. I don’t feel sorry for myself , because I know if I had opened up about it and overcome my demons years ago I wouldn’t be in the position I am now. I also drowned my sorrows on alcohol and drugs and literally never want to touch them again. I am now at the point where I know if I return home it’s going to be extremely hard for me, as the biggest part of this is what people think of me, and pretty much all my friends think I am something I am not. If I don’t go home to get help and speak to a medical professional about it, I know something I am not guilty for is going to haunt me forever.

23,"Sorry for typos and bad grammar, english isn't my first language, and I'm almost right crying writing this. TL:DR at the bottom

I'm failing my college currently, I failed Calculus II-A and B and Linear Algebra AND I'm currently on the verge of being kicking out of college (If I fail 4 Subjects in one semester I get kicked out) and I know I should study, but I can't put myself to do it, I know that I will regret it as soon as I get my Physics Test but I can't put on the effort to do it, currently I'm playing video-games and watching Netflix, and it isn't a game that I'm really enjoying to play, or a show that I REALLY like, I'm just doing this to not study, I fell bad when I remember how badly I'm going in college and then the will to study takes a dive down. Sincerely the only reason I'm still attending college is because I got no marketable skills whatsoever.

I can barely program in Python, my knowledge of Construction work or IT is laughably low, I love and understand cars and planes, engines and stuff, but not deeply enough to diagnose a problem and fix it. I once had a dream of being a mechanical engineer but the more I go trough college the more I fell that my dream profession, Aircraft Mechanic, doesn't require a degree, even more in this field.

Furthermore seeing all of my friends pass the same subjects with shining scores makes me fell like I'm not putting myself into it enough, which is true but again I can't put on the effort, me and my mother thinks its because of my Computer, but I feel it is so much more than that, for example once I was on the college with my laptop so I wouldn't get distracted and play video-games, but I found myself ignoring my video classes to, I'm not joking, COUNT THE NUMBER OF LAMPS IN THE BUILDING, I'M NOT JOKING, tiles on the floor, windows per floor, cars parked, or just like bumping my fingers in the table for HOURS, hours that I spend not studying, something that I was supposed to be doing instead of writing this post, but FUCK IT. 

And the more I study more advanced subjects, BECAUSE I'M THAT STUPID, the more I can't study Calculus and Algebra, because, although the equations seems BIZARRE they really aren't and that makes me all the more angrier, that I can't for the love of my FUCKING life study Calculus. Suicidal thoughts already went through my head, but I quickly dismiss then, but now after failing 3 subjects that essentially stop my whole College it started to make more sense and I'm very scared of it.

But the most important reason that this failed subjects get the better of me in this way is because I have and BAD ASS as my mother, she started to gain money when she had my age (19) and was financially independent by 23 and was moving to her own house by 27 and I can't picture myself doing none of it, not only because I have a college to attend but because as I said, I lack any marketable skills, I already thought of every bad idea on the book: suicide, dropping it, changing degrees, but it all come round to punch me in the face in seeing the disappointment in my mother face as I say that to her. There only 4 ways I can see myself growing up:

1- I suffer through College and be whatever after that being whatever, everyday after seeing other engineers, I see that they are on a completely different field that want to work, Aircraft and Automobiles, and it is the more logical choice for me, don't get picky and get a job, but again this perspective demotivates me even more 

2- Getting a low end job, just earning enough so I can pay my own bills

3- GETTING LUCKY, the one that won't happen

4- Or getting money from my mom so I can start my own business, I think that the only real way to proceed, because it's the only one I know that I can do it if try hard enough. And this option is ridiculously ridiculous, right now she isn't living in out house so she can finish building another house, while the best thing I can do is play video-games, and very well I might add

The point really is, that my Mom is the standard I'm judging myself too, and I fell horrible for failing with her this way, not only monetarily but also as a lack of perspectives for the future. She sees an easy exit, that been I start working for the government, it is hard, but once inside, forever inside, but that stinks me deeply

Sorry for the capitalist post, but I cannot even see myself gaining my first salary or something like that. I don't to live under my mother wing forever, yet I want too, man I'm so laughably a dumpster fire...

I wonder if now is the time to intervene. I might be the only person who can say something. I might be the only person willing to do something to help her.

There's so many specific details, but I want to keep this as succinct as possible.

She's a single mother and recently unemployed, which further complicates the whole situation and her ability to recover.

Numerous times I've offered to help if she was in trouble. For each of her episodes, I have responded as a brother should. I've opened my home to her and her son. I've offered to help with her financial problems. I've bared my soul to her, and have given her all the advice I can think of. I'm not even sure she's aware of the path she's on.

Her condition has been escalating for about a year. Prior to this, she was a fairly normal person -- not perfect, but no more troubled than any other person. The past 2 weeks have been the most severe I have ever seen.

She has been visited by emergency mental health services. They said she's healthy. She has been the subject of a missing persons report, after disappearing into a wooded trail overnight with her keys on the hood of her car and dead phone inside. The police said she is fine and there's nothing they can do. She is obviously self-mutilating: severe burns on her wrists, and black eye which I suspect was self-inflicted.

The odd thing is in normal interaction where she seems pretty stable, despite every other indication that she is is rapidly becoming disconnected from reality and dealing with some serious inner turmoil.

She's made minor efforts to reach out for help, but otherwise hasn't taken any steps on her own. It's becoming apparent that maybe she has an alcohol problem. Maybe she's been drowning her sorrow, and can no longer afford to self-medicate. She's also been experimenting with marijuana (she is definitely not known for this), which I suspect is making matters much, much worse. Recently she asked me to destroy her weed stash and I did. Perhaps there's other drugs involved, but I've never known her to be an addict of any sort. I overheard her vaguely mention something about rehab, but I don't know if she was joking or not.

Overall, she seems hell-bent on self-destructing. She's sabotaged all of her relationships and her entire support structure.

I'm trying to remain neutral here, as I don't want to be manipulated, but I also don't want to just abandon her or my nephew. I don't want to alienate her, but I also don't want her to hurt herself or someone else. At this point, this seems like a serious possibility.

I'm wondering how I might go about intervening. I was thinking about offering to take her to see a psychologist, but I'm not sure how that will go down. How does that even work? Do I take her to the ER? Would they do anything for her?

I really do feel stuck here. Do I help, or do I let this process of self-destruction play out?

Can someone share their experience with such situations? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.",12Jul2019,1

26,I have been struggling with depression for the last 4 years. Its been managable but recently it has been getting worse and worse. I've doubled my perscription but its losing its effect. My parents have suggested therapy and I agreed to do it but we haven't set anything up. My girlfriend recently had a talk with me about how she is tired of me not helping myself. We talked and i told her that i will try to get help but i am not enthusiastic about it. I just lack the motivation to get help. This is annoying both my parents and my girlfriend. Does therapy work? Any other advice i can try? Anything helps. Thank you.,12Jul2019,1
27,"-Possible violence warning-on mobile-
So I've had experiences with abuse, whether it be from a parent or a partner, I've been hit before. I thought it was something I've moved on from but I'm lying to myself at this point. Any time I make someone upset, I feel like I deserve to be hit. I used to hit myself in private when it got really bad, but I now catch myself wanting others to hit me. I know I need to seek a therapist for this type of problem, but where I live no longer has a psychiatrist that's within my insurance. Is there any way or mechanism that can help me get over this? How do I stop myself from wanting to be hit? I know logically that I shouldn't be hurting myself, but I just get this feeling like I deserve the pain.

28,"I'm not sure if this is the right forum for this, but I really need help for what to do for my mom. In the past year, my mom has become really depressed because of a medical condition. Despite it not affecting her ability to walk, eat, or move, it does bring her a lot of pain and doctors haven't had answers as to what is causing it, so she hasn't been able to get better. This has caused her mental state to go downhill. She hasn't left the house in over 3 months, she showers every 2 weeks, she doesn't sleep very well, she talks about how our whole family is doomed and how she wants to die, etc.

More recently, it's come to the point where she yells at my family for being stupid, messy, dirty, unstable, and how we deserve to die. She's also started to become more violent. Since she won't leave the house, we can't bring her to a psychiatrist/therapist and she also isn't willing to take any medication. As I see it now, it can only get worse.

31,"It's not what I thought it would be. It's making my anxiety and depression hit me after a long time being well.

1 month is not a long time and I feel very guilty and bad, but I waited to see if things would improve and they didn't.

People aren't toxic or anything, it's just that I didn't fit in there. And I don't know if I want the responsibilities people are giving me there.

Every day when there is a surprise, my anxiety rises and I spend the rest of the day exausted and just wishing I could lay on my bed and do nothing.

I'd like to hear if anyone here had a similar experience, because I feel so alone in this, feels like I'm the only person to quit a job after such a short period.

At the same time, I don't know what to do in the future. I don't know if I should look for another job in the area or change to another area. And I'm also scared of the implications quitting a job like this would cause on my search for a new job.

32,"So I have had autism spectrum disorder (formerly Asperger's Syndrome) and major depression with psychotic features since early childhood and was recently diagnosed with extreme OCD with poor/absent insight. My current psychiatrist can't figure out for sure if I have MDD with psychosis AND OCD with poor/absent insight or if the ""MDD with psychosis"" is actually a symptom of the OCD. Given the lack of effective meds (none of the meds my previous psychiatrist prescribed were trialled correctly but given the side effects I endured my current psychiatrist doesn't want to mess with non-SSRI meds if she doesn't absolutely have to.) and the severity of the OCD, I would have the go inpatient to treat the OCD with exposure therapy and I can't afford that. 

I've tried everything at this point, and I still keep running up against the same vicious cycle that no one IRL knows what to make of: 

1) I have intrusive thoughts that follow the pattern of ""IF I succeed/feel positive emotions/think positive thoughts/have faith in humanity/trust someone/insert good thing here THEN everything bad that can happen will happen, I will get blindsided, knocked on my ass, lose everyone I love, and I will never recover."" 
2) I label and then defuse from the thoughts (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is the only therapy that has given me the tools to talk about what is going in my head)
3) My body and emotions respond to the intrusive thoughts as if they are reality - despite me not only defusing, but knowing full well the risk-assessment part of my ""word machine"" is malfunctioning due to genetics/childhood abuse/intergenerational trauma.
4) I manage to do basic self-care things like shower, eat, wear clean clothes, but nothing else because my body and emotions are not responding to reality. It's nice outside and I want to go on a walk? That means the snakes and bobcats are out, must stay indoors! I need to pull the clover from the front garden? MORMONS AND JEHOVAHS WITNESSES ARE GOING TO SEE ME AND TRY TO CONVERT ME! Oh is that too ridiculous? I'M GOING TO GET BITTEN BY A SNAKE/SPIDER/BOBCAT KITTEN/COYOTE. 
4) report failure to accomplish goals other than very basic self-care to therapist, get told to work harder on defusing.
5) Repeat for months on end with no improvement other than being able to identify thoughts and at least cognitively defuse from them even if my body and emotions refuse to get the memo.

Any ideas on what's going on? Is ACT not working or I am doing something wrong?",12Jul2019,1
33,"I'm 18 years old and weigh a lot. I've always been a heavy set person in all honesty. I've never been slim or skinny and I never felt good about myself. Not sure how it started but I have an extremely unhealthy relationship with food that hinders me from achieving my goals. Its like, I tell myself to stop eating so bad and it's like a part of me is literally ignoring myself and it frustrates the hell out of me.

I've had moments where i stuck to eating only three times a day (it was a lot easier while at school because I don't have access to food all day) and I've done it for a week straight. After dinner,i wouldn't eat anymore. But since I'm on summer break and have more access to food, I catch myself eating even when I'm extremely full. There are times where I'm actually arguing with myself to not get a whole freaking meal at 4am, but I end up doing it. 

I've noticed my desire to eat is stronger when I'm feelimg really bad about myself or stressed. Or maybe I'm feeling a lot of anxiety and I just turn to food. I'll go to my mom's room and grab a lot of snacks and eat so many at once. I'll eat so much ice-cream or eat cereal after I've just had dinner. I know when I'm up late talking to my best friend I'll ask her, ""should I eat this?"" And she'll tell me no, but I do it anyways.

It's to the point where i really feel sad and discouraged from losing weight. I feel like I can't do it because of this unhealthy habit I have. It's hard to feel motivated when I know I'm just going to go pig out on leftovers like an hour later. And it really really makes me just..hate myself so much. 

Sometimes I'll think maybe I should just not eat for a few days and it'll somehow help me. And I know that's such an unhealthy mindset to have but I feel theres no other way. I just don't know what to do.

I can't see a therapist or anything because i don't have insurance as of now unfortunately.  Feel extremely trapped",12Jul2019,2

But I had no success and eventually the feeling went away and I realised I wasn’t dreaming.
And then today for a few minutes I thought maybe I didn’t exist, I don’t know how to explain this but I knew there was a chance I was alive but I was trying to post things on reddit and no one commented anything nor upvoted/downvoted, so after several minutes I deleted my posts. Then my parents got home and were watching a movie, they usually come by room to say hi but they didn’t, and I had this feeling that I wasn’t alive, that maybe this wasn’t even happening. I panicked a little but knew maybe I wasn’t really dead. I waited and wished that someone would come talk to me and then my mom knocked on my door and gave me goodnight and my feeling went away.

Ive been wanting to just write for a while now, i dont know why but i want to catalog my thougts, i guess because its gonna be the closest thing i can have to a conversation. Sometimes when im laying in bed or alone with my thoughts i just start to think and my thoughts drift, sometimes they go to very dark places but im not there right now. I think that it might be because im alone so much and that is why my mind drifts like a tiny floating particle just meandering about brushing against different emotions and trains of thought. what i feel right now is regret. Im thinking about some things i did that disappoint me and why did i do them and more importantly why do i hate myself for doing them. Every train of thought when im alone in my mind comes back to this question, why do i hate myself. I dont know why i do but i think it comes from the fact that im not good at anything. Im incredibly useless but not to everyone around me just to myself. I get this feeling lots when im playing games by myself all my tiny faults and errors are so basic and correctable, it seems like im an eyelash away from doing things right but i never can. No matter how hard i try i can never be good enough there will always be somone better so why try. I would love to be the best at something if i knew definitively that i was good at 1 thing i would have something to pride myself on. The best and only thing i can ever do is strive for mediocratey and i still fail. I dont know why but it makes me feel so useless knowing that im just not good and never will be. Im trying to think of what else i can say to express my emotions but i dont know what to say. I dont know how to express the thoughts in my mind and that brings me to another point, my lonliness.

If i had the balls to kill myself i would have been dead before i got into middle school but the only thing that keeps me from doing it is the thought that my family might love me but im not so sure anymore. I got in a fight with my sister today over nothing she just wanted to bake some cookies and i blew up on her. There wasnt a single person in my family who didnt yell at me tonight other then my brother. I dont know if anybody loves me anymore and im starting to believe nobody does.

Sometimes i try and find a way to talk myself out of it by thinking maybe im autistic or have aspergers but the truth is im no different. Im defective a product of my own failures and nothing i can do will ever change that. Im doomed to be sad lonely and miserable forever and i dont deserve any different. The truth is im a burden to everyone i meet, parasitic. Im going to continue to suck off of everyone around me until the day i die. I wish i could hide all of my troubles behind a diagnosis of autism, what i wouldent give for a dark corner to rot in. All i want is to disappear. Sometimes the only way for me to fall asleep is to say to myself that in my dreams my brain might be good enough to make me mediocre at something, anything. Im going into higschool next year and all i want is to disappear to be able to ride along, but life isnt a spectator sport and one of these days im going to have to take the wheel and stear or im going to drive myself off of the edge this is probably going to be my suicide note someday but maybe not. Im probably going to have to write more of these to keep myself functioning because i think im on the edge of a mental breakdown but i have nothing stressful in my life i have never had a girlfriend and i dont think i ever will because the truth is my social skills are to bad. im never invited to conversations, parties, discussions or anything of the like and im to afraid to try and push my way in because i wouldent be able to handle the rejection. it would literally tear me apart because even my slightest failures make me feel so stupid like im never going to be good enough and i am for lack of a better word retarded. One that comes to mind is that for my 14th birthday i went to new york and while we were up there they had the starry night on display at MOMA, i couldent care less but my dad wanted to get a picture of me standing next to the portrait so i went up and stood next to the painting a respectful distance away. the attendant at the painting told me to move a little further away and i felt like the world stopped like this whole crowd of 30+ people were judging me and in my mind they all thought that i was the most horrible rotten peice of shit who ever lived. All of this was set in to motion by the flick of a wrist. I cant imagine what words could do to me if i ever truely let sombody in and let them see me for me they could twist that and use it against me. Im so terrified of being hurt that i cant go anywhere or meet anyone because im to mentaly fragile. I just want sombody to love me but i am incapable of having those relationships. Everybody in my life thinks that im a happy healthy and fully functioning person but im not. Ive had mental health issues before and it got bad enough to where i almost tried to kill myself not because i wanted to die but because i wanted help.

46,"I've been having anger episodes. At first little things would happen and I'd get really mad, now I start screaming and I have this itchy feeling in my body or my soul. I can't explain what I mean by this but it makes me want to yell louder.

I've also been getting ""jealous"" but I wouldn't call it jealousy. I feel bad for myself when I see others happy. But I also feel happy for them, it's just i look down upon myself.

And my moods have been changing quite easily and it seems for no reason. One minute I'm happy and 30 seconds later I have the biggest attitude and am snobby for no reason.

I don't know if this has correlation, but I have been really nauseous and have been having headaches around the clock. I don't sleep anymore. My bedtime has been around 3am-5am and my body wakes me right up a couple hours later. I keep rolling around in my sleep and I barely feel like I sleep. Like right now it's 1:30am and I dont plan on going to sleep.

Another thing I've noticed was that I'm overall bored with life. Nothing interests me, literally nothing. I lose interest fast and anytime I make an attempt to do something I quit within the same week if not the same day. I'm not good at anything so I'm not surprised.

If it's of any relevance I don't have any friends and I live in the city, I live in the city with my family and with people I don't consider my family whatsoever, but are by blood. It's a long story behind that but I have a deep hatred for them and have no choice but to see them. I don't want to get into thay right now because it triggers me just thinking about them. 

I guess I'm asking if anyone knows ways to cope that doesn't have to do with me trying new hobbies because it's starting to piss me off. My days consist of the same thing—failures and more failure. I just don't know what to do anymore. These days I will sit and stare into space for hours and as melodramatic as it may seem, it's true.

I'm 18 and was supposed to graduate this year but there has been some complications with school (I'm homeschooled) and now I might have to take an extra year of high school. I'm starting to lose interest in college because there's nothing that interests me. Trust me I sat and thought for hours a day about this and I cannot see myself doing anything. These days I feel like I'm just an anomoly in a timeline, like I wasn't supposed to exist because my life is completely screwed up, it's like it's making itself up as it goes, like there was no plan or preparation for me.

49,"hey everyone, i'm posting here because i haven't sought actual help yet but I feel i need some advice or whatever.

Let me tell you guys a background of myself. Growing up, I was apparently the most talkative, extroverted kid my mom has ever seen (she used to work with many kids since she was a psychologist), and she told me stories about how when i was young I would literally start walking away with strangers because I just loved talking to them about everything. Throughout elementary school and middle school, I was as happy as ever and had many friends and would constantly get in trouble for talking too much during class. 

However, once I went to high school, I developed *severe* social anxiety for some reason and I don't know why since I was always so happy, talkative, extroverted, etc. when I was younger. It was so bad that I forced my mom to let me stay in the car while she dropped me off so that I wouldn't have to sit in the courtyard by myself with everyone and their friends before the first class bell rang. Given that my high school was very small (the average class size was around 30 students for each grade), I was able to develop close friendships with a couple of people from my class (my two best friends actually) and it took me the whole 4 years to warm up to everyone there and I begun to see my old talkative, extroverted self again. 

Fast forward to college and I am entering my junior year. I believe I have developed some pretty bad depression. My freshman year was amazing - I had my first real girlfriend, I made lots of friends, did intramural sports, and had a great year. But come second year, I moved to an apartment with 4 of my friends and I found myself slowly isolating myself away from them just playing video games, being on my computer, etc. I started to fail courses badly and have a low 2.0 GPA because of it. I have begun to start having suicidal thoughts as well. I have begun to start distancing myself (not intentionally) from my friends here and I have reason to believe they are starting to hang out without me and everything. I have begun to think that every single person I used to hang out with during freshman year does not enjoy my company anymore and I have distanced myself completely from them. They used to always send me invites to parties, smoke sessions, etc. but I always had an excuse for it. I keep telling myself that I want to improve myself and become a healthier person, mentally. But I find myself digging deeper holes that I cant seem to get out of.

It has gotten to the point where I cancelled a coffee date with a girl I met on tinder because my anxiety has overruled me and I got to the point where I was shaking a bit just thinking about the coffee date that I could not handle it. 

This summer, I decided to stay in my apartment instead of going home. I am here by myself, all my roommates went home. I have had 3 months with nothing but my computer, a minimum wage job, and my thoughts. Im finding my thoughts are getting worse and more harmful to myself. I can't remember the last time I had a positive thought about myself.

I'm not really sure what I'm looking for by posting this, but It helps a little bit to write about it and post it to somewhere where someone might have some advice or has been in a similar situation. 

Thanks I guess.",12Jul2019,1

I am in a demanding job and I cope OK, but people expects more..I think.

I used to self-harm, but haven’t for years. I have a chronic illness but not symptomatic yet. I had a traumatic brain injury last year, but I recovered exceptionally well (still have issues, but considering lots of people die from this, I am doing great). But part of me really want an excuse to be a failure, and kind of sorry that I recovered so well. Weird hey! But when I was recovering from surgery, I really wanted to work, felt soo guilty people have to cover for me. And I don’t tell people these things, I hate attention. I pretend I am fine at work everyday, brush it off when people ask if I am OK. Maybe I want to feel brave “look I am a mess but I am functional”. What the F! Sigh!

68,"I don't really know if this goes here, but I don't know where else I can post it. 

So, this needs some background, and there's a lot to talk about, so this is going to be a very long post. TL;DR at the bottom.

 A few months ago I dated this girl online who I'll call M. We dated for about 6 months in total, and I truly believed I was in love with her. M and I had been friends for a couple years beforehand and she seemed like a genuinely lovely person - though she had a few issues. Throughout our friendship she would constantly break down over seemingly very small things, and would tell me often that she was suicidal and/or about to kill herself. 

When we started dating, I stupidly believed I could fix her. She seemed very depressed, and I wanted to help her - but she would often refuse to listen to me when I gave her advice, or had another breakdown. Some of the things she did include:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Text me saying she was going to kill herself (Often saying she was standing in front of a busy road)

\-Text me saying she was going to kill herself after an argument, usually when I did something she didn't like

\-Text me saying she had cut herself and/or sent me pictures of her self harm 

\-Text me saying she had cut herself because of something I did 

\-Scream, cry, have a panic attack etc whenever I brought up any issues 

\-Scream, cry, have a panic attack etc for absolutely no reason

\-Guilt trip me (E.g say it was her fault over and over and wouldn't calm down until I told her it was my fault)

\-Accuse me of things I didn't do 

\-Would immediately have a panic attack when I suggested any help

\-Make me feel like a horrible person whenever I wouldn't talk to her for small amounts of time (E.g six hours of school)

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the things I did in the relationship: 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Text her saying I was suicidal a few times with the intentions of making her feel guilty 

\-Overreact to a lot of issues I shouldn't have

&amp;#x200B;

I recognize that the things I did were wrong, very wrong in fact, and I often feel awful for ever hurting her. But she would threaten to kill herself so often, and panic so much, that I guess I sort of assumed it was okay. I thought this was normal, in a way, because she would do it so often. I recognize now, though, that I should have known better. It was not okay to guilt trip her like I did, even if I saw my reasons for doing so as 'justified' (etc telling her that her behaviour was making me suicidal after she cut herself). But I feel I can acknowledge that now, whereas after we broke up, she didn't acknowledge anything. 

The break up itself was terrible. First, she lied to me, and made it look like she was about to kill herself. After three horrible days of constant worrying, I asked a mutual friend to check on her. She was alive. And completely fine. I messaged her, telling her I knew she lied, and she proceeded to tell me that I had betrayed her trust. Then she went on to blame everything on me by telling me that me 'constantly telling her to change' was incredibly controlling (I told her she should make healthy changes to herself to improve her mental health and everyone else's) and blamed everything on me, basically saying she was breaking up with me and it was all my fault. The only apology I ever got from her was 'I no I'm no saint either, but'

I still blame myself for a lot. I constantly feel like I could have done better, and helped her more, and I hate myself for being even the slightest bit manipulative towards her. But my friends and my therapist tell me it wasn't my fault, and recently I've started to believe them a little bit. I'm really good friends with another one of her exes, and he tells me that she put him through the same thing, and he considers her very emotionally abusive. Which made me feel a bit better, knowing that since i'm not the only one, I'm probably not in the wrong. 

Any advice or opinions would be very greatly appreciated &lt;3

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My ex girlfriend would constantly threaten suicide, send pics of her self harm etc when I did things wrong. My friends and therapist say she was bordering emotionally abusive towards me. I'm starting to believe it wasn't my fault. Advice is appreciated",12Jul2019,6

72,"Well where do I start? I’m not from the US, immigrated here with mom to here few years ago. Mom and dad got divorced and dad got into some turmoil in china and is sentenced for 6 years in Chinese prison. We used to be a middle class family but our financial situation just worsens (mom have to now work 24/7, 10 hours a day). Because of the divorce, the financial situation, and people picking on me because of my accent and small eyes, my mental health took a nose dive, it was a traumatic experience for both me and my mom. 

I’m now a senior HS student, I never got diagnosed with anything but for all I know is I am a patchwork of mental health issues. 

Here’s the problem, mom says I don’t care enough for the family and I don’t appreciate what she does for me, whilst ironically not appreciate me for what I do. She kept criticizing me for not picking up the chores in the house when in reality I just cannot muster the motivation to do so, and whenever I bring it up in front of her the fact that I feel like I’m mentally ill, she takes it very personally saying people have been through worst things and I’m just being ungrateful, saying the bad times I have means nothing and I’m just selfish. She keeps bringing up examples of how I do not care for the family and when I object saying I did do things, she just dismisses then as “you are supposed to do that anyways”. 

I don’t know what to do, for one I want to stand up for myself and not to let her toxic mentality get to me. But I understand why she is this way, she’s probably having a worse time than me, but at the same time her standards for me just seems insatiable, everything I don’t do is listed as why I am a selfish bad person, and everything I DO is listed as “you’re supposed to do that, it is expected of you”.

It seems to me that I’m having a one person pity party, and don’t want to make problems for others. I’m too old for this shit, and should be “better”.

74,"So I woke up some hours ago with quite a bit of anxiety. But some minutes ago something happened to my understanding of reality, which has happened before. I can't really remember anymore what exactly it was, I only know it gets worse every time. It's like I feel so vulnerable in this concept of life. Like at every given moment reality could collapse in itself and there could be shifts happening that mean the end of being. I know this is impossible, but when it happens it feels like it might very well be true one day. It completely destroys my sense of ""me"" and I'm dissociating a lot. Sometimes it also feels like I'm so far away from home, as if I live now a whole new life in a whole new reality, which I know is not true.

What confuses me is the fact that mindfulness is said to be a great tool against anxiety disorders, when it just fuels these attacks for me. And doctors/therapists also couldn't help me so far... I feel like I'm patient 0 with this condition. They often think I might be psychotic, but always dismiss the idea because I never heard voices, saw things or believed in something, which isn't possible.

I went from high school diploma to social security in five years, mostly because these reality problems fuck with my performance and focus.

I feel as if I’m either some kind of fully insane person who is of enough intelligence to be aware of the fact or if I’m two people in one body and one has lost it already and the other is stuck in the back seat observing while everything happens and it’s like I can watch my own thoughts, but it’s at the same time as I’m thinking them so it’s difficult to think straight because both perspectives are clashing and I am constantly tearing apart myself mentally. I feel exhausted in my head and I don’t want to be in my head anymore. It’s gotten to the point where I really want to hurt myself to make it go away and I don’t know of any other option. 

This issue in particular is making everything else that I’m dealing with in life that much harder and it’s pushing me to a point where along with my personal fanatical beliefs and convictions and the conflicting perspective I have and am living is tearing me down and I have nothing left. I’m tired, I’m sad, I’m stressed, I’ve slept less than an hour each night for the last couple weeks, i have nothing left in the tank and I don’t know what is wrong with us or what I’m supposed to do or what to think.

86,"So my main issue is that I don't know what is wrong with me, my girlfriend says that I guilt trip her sometimes (2 times in the year we have been together), and I hate myself for doing it, but I am an honest man, so I say what I feel when I feel it, I also struggle with social anxiety and I am supposed to get evaluated for schizophrenia once I getback from vacation, but the main thing is that I don't feel like I belong anywhere, I feel outside, I don't understand how to explain my feelings, even tho I can say that I love my girlfriend and wish to do her no harm in ANY way, but feelings, social things and life in general is just so hard, I also struggle with being too jealous and overprotective becsuse everyone is better than me, I take medication aswell, Zyprexa for psychosis that I have (hearing voices and beeing paranoid) and Efexor for depression and anxiety, but I want to smoke weed so bad because I love the feeling and I would give anything if it gets better, even just for a short period of time, I don't care about myself in the long run anymore, even if everything gets worse with weed.",12Jul2019,1

89,"Hello reddits !

It's my first post here and i'm french so correct me if i do something wrong !  


To resume my situations, I'm 21 and i'm having a kind of love/hate relation ship with my loneliness and life problems. And reading/listening to people story i'm starting to think i have some mental illness but i really can't understand what i have and what to do with this...  
So i'm going to list what are my problems and what i have encouters in life that lead me to think i have a problem   
To clarify i don't want to have problems or claiming i have mental issues when other people really suffers and i'm not at all at their level of illness, but time past and i have noticed some strange behaviours and would like a little feedbacks from strangers on the internet :).  


I'm going to make a list of what i think is weird in my behaviours and what i think got me in the situation i'm today.  


\- I'm lonely and i love it because it is quiet and relaxing and i love doing stuff like looking at the stars for hours and just think about life. But loneliness make me depressed because it reminds me that i don't have a friend to watch the stars with..   
I don't see the purpose of having ""friends"" if we don't really connected, help and care for each other so i'm usually nice to people and try to make them laugh, everyone kinda like me and laugh in class with me (during this 2 years i was in 4 different class of 25+ people because i switch every semester so i basically knew almost everyone in my promo).  
But i have 0 close friends that i see after class.   
\- This get us to a second point that i hate party/social events (where you make friends most of the time..) because i really don't like loud noises and i hate the fact that i can't talk to people or hear them in those events.   
I also don't drink alcohol (don't like the taste..) and since after high school 90% of the party include drunk teenagers waving on the music i just don't go to party and people don't bother inviting me.  
I have only one friend that i can talk about everything and i really like him (most of the time we talk until 2 a.m, then smoke some weed and talk until sun rise up). But i know that if i'm in trouble he will not really be there, he have trouble with a girl and i drive 100km to talk with him multiple time and i clearly know that he will never do the same...  
\- I have trouble understaning people (particullary women). I think i'm good at reading people but i really don't know how to interact and responds to them. I have a female friend who was having problem in her life (school stress, family, food related problems etc...). She never talk to me about this, i knew it but i never talk to her about that and i'm feelings shitty because i could and i really want to help her because i care about her but i don't know how to talk to people. I'm just good at basic interactions but i want to do more for people i care about but i'm just really goofy..   


Here comes the weird behaviours,

\- I can get reaaally passionnate by a hobbie and then change completely to a different one (i have go from Leggo (tons of lego/bionicles as a child), to xbox gaming, to fitness, computer gaming, and now computer programming.

When i say really passionnate i mean i can spend multiple day alone (even more now that i'm indepedant). I sometimes stay in my appartment for 2 or 3 days without social interaction just because i found a cool programm/programming language to learn.

I had tons of lego as a child and play alone in my room, when in my xbox period, i have those scuff gaming controller and play during holidays from 10am to 2am in the morning everyday. On one fucking games black ops 2 because my dad past away and my mom doesn't like video games and me staying in front of that screen so she doesn't buy me other games (understandables).. To the point i had mastered almost everything in the games (for the bo2 players that read this it means i was really good at zombies (40+ rounds on every map, killfeed with sniper, league play (1 of the 1 division almost every season) , trickshots (masters every kind of trickshot the games glitches has offer) etc..)

\- When i have learned a lot on a subject and seems to have mastered it i just completely drop it and found a new one, wich is frustating a lot because  i'm good in a lot of things very quickly because i spent day and night training it but after one or two years i have the level of 5-6 years person on this subject but i just stop doing it and found something else. 

In skateboarding (only activites where there is a kind of social interaction)  the first year i was going to the skatepark 6 times a week for 3-4 hours until my body can't take it. So in 1 years i was almost as good as other local with 4 years of skate.  
And even there, i like to skate with people but i don't talk a lot and i just skate, they sometimes think i'm in a bad mood but not at all.  


To resume, from my early age i get hobbies that take 80% of my time and change them like a pair of socks after 1 or two years,  my dad past away when i was 11, my mom has been then in a toxic relationship with a men (who appears to drink a lot),  she get pregnant with him, to protect her and my now little brother i have call the cops and get him out of my house (now it's a past story and my brother his the most enjoyable kids ever).  
During high school broken heart from a 2 years relationship (i realise and have learned now that i was trying to fill the void left by my dad with her and that you don't mix your love for a girl and your family/personnal issues in the same kind of way..). To now 4 years after, doesn't had any relationship with a girl after that, my habilities to make friends is slowly decreasing and it hit me hard.   
I smoke weed (no tabac or cigarettes, just pur weed) to escape my inexistance social life and get my head out of my computer because i can't stop thinking about things to do (for example in two weeks i have past more than 70 hours on it to setup a good backend for my future applications and i always think of new thinks to add, or to correct..).  
But weed tend to increase my problems overall but... \*shrugs\*.  
Sorry to have written so much and sorry it's a real mess.  
Writing this has really help me even if i could write more for hours i try to restrain myself.  
I have never talk to someone about that and how i feel so getting it out instead of just turning it over and over in my head was great, thanks reddit for this :)",12Jul2019,1
90,"For the past year just about i have been having severe losses in memory where large chunks of my time and activities disappear from my mind even though they just happened. It's not that I remember them and then not remember them, its that from my perception they dont exist..  I WAS dating this wonderful girl for multiple years up until this time period mentioned above. I started to notice that alot of times I would wake up (figuratively and literally) to being called crazy and a dick head among 10098 other things. I chalked this up to women being crazy and I would ease her back down.  She then started to quote me during these occasions and I honestly could have taken a polygraph test and passed swearing I never did or said any of these things shes claiming . Until screenshots started to come on multiple occasions and I realized large parts of some days where completely unaccounted for in my memory.  She left me... she had left me despite knowing that's not me , but it was undeniable ... it was me given the evidence.  And when this happened my mind snapped like a pretzel.  And after walking around feeling like I was watching my body on auto pilot through two holes in my head sorta like inner 3rd person I sorta got better. I still didnt believe it. But recently I noticed some odd things that I've been doing. In currently maintaining 3 relationships online with women.... I have never met or spoken to them befor in my life and never have I seen the messages . I'm convinced this is a sick joke but I'm not going to say it is. More often then not I cannot see full conversations. I am in the military and this is seeming dangerous to me that I dont know what I'm doing.  I recently woke up to being in trouble for insubordination for things I have not done. I am worried. I have logs of arguments I get in with friends and family that I dont remember happening and recently when i went home for vacation to unwind i woke to find my home full of random people sleeping, I do not do drugs and I have never. I do drink beer with friends on occasion but never hard alcohol.  I believe most of this discovery is due to the wonder of online interactions and message logs otherwise I would have been oblivious.  It seems more and more I seem to be losing my time and more and more I am ruining my relationships and work place reputation . Did I split in two? Is the me typing the real me or the fake me? Am I the other one ? The violent aggressive rude and terrible one. What is wrong with me. ? I cannot use the resources provided by the military or I will be risking my career .",12Jul2019,2
91,"There have been a few times where I have had mental health blips, first time it was age 14, I wasn't sleeping and starting to see things etc. So I ended up in a kids mental health clinic for a few weeks. I did things such as run off and unfortunately it got spreaded via media by people who it had nothing to do with and I'm not sure how this was aloud. So after I came out of the hospital my dad brought up how he was having a breakdown after blaming me for my state of mind.

Then had a few blips in my early and mid twenties, hypomanic doing odd things, running off had breif delusions and anxiety. It caused problems for my family as I still live with them at the moment but will be moving at some point. On occasion my dad starts going on about it arrogantly saying you caused a lot of shit bla bla as you can expect. Last year I also went through a hypomanic blip and had a misscarrage around the same time which caused a lot of arguments so I had to deal with that by myself. However that's hardly brought up I was 26 when that happened.

Does anyone else have relatives that angrily and or arrogantly bring up problems you've caused in the past in that frame of mind at random? It makes me feel embarrassed when brought up and can't win an argument about it.",12Jul2019,1

93,"My mom was a functioning alcoholic for years, was a full blown alcoholic for four, and currently has been sober for almost 2 now. Her life now consists of lounging around the house and doing nothing. She barely takes care of herself.  She won’t eat food for days. I’ve seen her go more than a week a couple times. Those times she’s so frail and shaky its like her bones rattle. She also doesn’t sleep. This is the weird part. Every other day she’s up for like 36 hours. And when she does that she goes through these very unsettling episodes. Where she can’t hold a basic conversation or form a sentence even. Just total loss of control. One time she came into my room and ask “did the doctor take blood?” just coldly staring at me. These episodes seem to coincide with her lack of sleep. Because as soon as she rests, she’ll go back to normal. I’ll even ask her about the weird episode she had and she always saids she doesn’t remember. This morning is the worst I’ve seen her though. Hospital worthy. She’s walking around talking to herself and profusely shaking. Like she’s about to have a seizure. I’m not sure what to do anymore. I’ve lost so many years just taking care of my mom. I’m done. How can a person take care of someone who doesn’t want to take care of themselves? Also has anyone heard of a condition like this?

94,"So I am in this year-long software development program and I graduate in literally 13 days. I was extremely stressed because I could write a NOVEL about the trauma I've been through before this program (PTSD, anxiety, and OCD as a result of an extremely abusive upbringing where my mother almost tried to kill me, and years of homelessness from 17 to 20), but since getting in, my life has been getting much better. The program is a year long, but they've gotten me REALLY good insurance, and I've also been given an educational stipend the entire time, so I haven't had to work while I study.


The thing is that as soon as we graduate, that stipend stops. And I've been in a PANIC. I remember being on and off jobless for two years, having it kill my relationship and destroy my mental health. The thought of being on the job search again after graduation has been tearing me apart. My school does 4 months of job placement assistance, but I would have to survive off of a very meager savings. I have literally developed an involuntery twitch in my right eye, and on and off headaches. I've gained a little weight because I'm stress eating (this has never happened before -- Yay!), and it's just been an all around bad time...


Until someone on LinkedIn contacted me yesterday about an interview.


And not just ANY interview -- they're trying to fast-track me and have me employed to start a day after my graduation. It's a company my school is partnered with and they need someone FAST. They're even skipping a technical interview. It's all amazing news, and having grown up SUPER poor, the amount of money still kind of has me in shock. **The thing is, every time I go from having an unbelievable amount of stress to very little or none, my body experiences pain...** I'm not sure if this is because I'm physically unclenching? Like my shoulders are USUALLY seized up or tense most of the time. It's like my default state. But today, I feel completely and totally relaxed because my job search and 22-year-struggle is about to be over, and yet my pains are getting a bit worse. The last time something like this happened, my body needed to sleep for 12 hours a day for a good 5 days or so before I got used to being relaxed. I'm going to set a doctor's appointment (I'm constantly having to remind myself I have insurance now!) as soon as possible, but does anyone else experience this?",12Jul2019,1
96,"(Long post warning)

I (23 years old) just wanted to add a little back story for myself here: I currently have severe anxiety/depression— but was able to get it under control with a mixture of therapy and (many) medications. I was on prozac for a little over a year when I realized my main problem was due to my stressful job at the time. Really sad that I had to do this just to stay with my current job. I got myself a new job and stopped taking the medicine cold turkey (not the greatest idea but hey no side effects). I am personally doing quite well and check myself quite often to make sure I am doing okay. No suicidal thoughts in over a year now. 😊

Main topic:
My friend (25 years old) is currently in a not so ideal situation. He is essentially supporting his own family— as in his mother, her boyfriend, father, younger sister (18 years old) &amp; brother (21 years old). His mom and dad are both collect disability and don’t work. His sister refuses to get a job, and his brother works but I’m not sure what he does with his money. His mom’s boyfriend works too I think but he does pay him rent. 

So my friend is forced to work 2 jobs (roughly 60+ hours) per week. Not helping his condition— this is only where it starts. 

A couple of months ago he became infatuated with a guy (19 years old) (my friend is bisexual, but more gay) he worked with. He became friends with him, and then explained how he felt to him but the guy told him he wasn’t gay and had a girlfriend. They hung out a lot— but this person was mainly using him for rides and to use his car. There are A LOT of stories that happened between them but I am unsure what is truthful and what isn’t, because my friend has told me on countless occasions that he lied about this and that. He became obsessed with the idea that he wanted to have sex with him.

He first started to see a therapist at the time, mainly because his mom forced him to. He then got switched to a psychiatrist. I’m not entirely sure what drugs he is all on right now— but I do know he did take prozac (he said she took him off of that), and that he does take adderall. 

It then spread to my boyfriend (22 years old) as well. He wasn’t obsessed with him, but constantly just reminded me that he wanted to have sex with him and talked to me a lot about what he wanted to do to him (then got upset with me when I asked him to not talk about it with me because it was my boyfriend he was talking about). 

This is where this all becomes rocky. I really don’t know when he is telling me the truth. I confronted him about it but all that he does is ignore it, or turn the situation around to attack me instead. I keep explaining that I am just trying to help him but it goes around in a circle. He told me that his psychiatrist put him on xanax, and gave him (needle) tranquilizers to help him sleep. Is that even possible because he’s at high risk to self harm— so why would they allow someone to have needles? He then told me that he snorted an adderall too— and somehow his psychiatrist took away his xanax when he told her that. 

To top this all off, one day we were having a conversation and (he could have been joking, but is this really something to joke about?) he said that 2 things were going to happen by the end of the year— that he was going to have sex with this guy from work and my boyfriend and he didn’t care if he would have to go to jail so that it would happen. 

Then this happened the other night— he was saying that he was just getting closer and closer to killing himself every day. I told him that he obviously didn’t want to do it because he was still here. I keep explaining to him (we are somewhat religious) that God still has him here for a reason, that he just needs to keep getting the help that he needs. I told him that I think spending some time in a psychiatric facility might help him more than he thinks. He says the only thing keeping him here is his mom. I told him that I was also considering to call the suicide hotline and explain his situation and see what they thought. 

He then told me that if I were to do that he would kill himself and his mother and because then he would have nobody to worry about. He told me that it would be my fault that it happened. I told him no it isn’t, and that that would be a very selfish thing to do on his end. I told him he needed to talk to his psychiatrist and tell her everything that he was feeling, because he is beginning to refuse to speak to her (or so he says).

I dropped the conversation and brought it back up yesterday. I asked him how his session went. He told me that he shouldn’t have opened up to someone who isn’t trained to tell the difference between what is real and what is a lie. He said the session went good and a lot of other great sounding things, like that they told him he was proud that he was doing small mental things to help him get through the day. I told him I was proud of him and that I would be devastated if something ever happened to him. I also told him that joking or not, the next time he threatens someone else’s life I am calling the police. 

Everything was fine after that, or so it seemed. My boyfriend and I split up over this period of time (maybe for 2 1/2 weeks) and he obviously tried to sleep with him but my boyfriend again isn’t gay. He lied to me saying my bf sent him nudes, etc, that I know he wouldn’t do. My bf and I have had a rocky relationship and a lot of people don’t support us getting back together— however, it is our choice with what we do and I am leaving that subject there. 

My friend was mad about us getting back together— sending my bf texts like, “So you’ll just go running back to her for support when I was here all along,” “You’ll have sex with her and not me, kind of selfish if you ask me,” “All you want is sex and I tried to give that to you,” and so forth. 

I had a completely normal conversation with him over text yesterday, talking about his newborn kittens. He asked me how our vacation to the beach was going around 12am this morning, and after I woke up this morning I saw that he completely blocked me everywhere. I can’t even call him.

He claims to be my friend but I just don’t know what else to do to keep supporting him when I just keep getting really hurt. I have been his friend since 2006, and to be honest his family feels like it’s a part of my own. I am just really hurting, and just don’t know how to help him.",12Jul2019,3

In the past year I've made some friends and even got myself a girlfriend (ex now but we are buds). The thing is, they know I don't have a good image of myself and understand that I just never feel great. I just wish somebody could say ""I know you don't like yourself, but I like you"". It would just make me feel so much more comfort. I don't know where this thought came from, but the idea that I just feel like shit so often and nobody tries to hell me makes me feel like I'm slowly drowning in despair.",12Jul2019,4
100," 

5 years ago I was an alcoholic, I was 19, and I was ready to die. I chugged my beer, threw the can to the ground, and was prepared to jump. At that moment I was under a campus investigation, didn't have my iphone, and used my little walmart flip phone to call suicide hotline. I cried and explained to them that I shouldn't be bothering them with this shit. That they had other people who were actually worth saving. Month later, i was transferring schools, and was finally admitting i was an alcohlic. well... it actually took waking up after a night of binge drinking, black-out driving, drinking tobasco sauce, and shitting myself in my friends basement to realize that i was an alcoholic. Over the next few weeks I convinced myself a few beers would be fine and wound up drunk driving to my parents and telling them that I had lied to them for almost a full year about how much I drank. I went to my new school, blacked out once more, and called my parents and told them I was too weak to quit. The next week I was in therapy, I was in AA, and I was ready to try out life. Later my girlfriend of 4 years on and off decided to cheat on me 2 hours before I arrived at her campus (a 15 hour bus ride). I found out because i saw over her shoulder she was sending nudes to him while next to me. I stayed sober through this, entered a new abusive relationship with a girl that hit me, told me she would kill me, and often told me i was the abusive one (i never laid a hand on her or even called her a name for that matter... how can i make someone else feel lesser when i was ultimately worthless in my own head). Nonetheless, I got out of that relationship, decided that waking up in physical pain from depression wasn't normal anymore, went on anti-depressants and ADHD medication, and moved on with my life.

Today, I am 5 years sober, I am in a LOVING relationship, I have a good finance job, and I am looking to make a difference in this world for everyone who may be struggling. I use my story to show others that things DO GET BETTER. And I ultimately love everyone and want to improve everyone's life. I started a group, [www.Propositivity.com](https://www.Propositivity.com) You can visit the website of the same name and read my story, read other stories, or just learn about mental illness. If any of you want to share your story and help others with the same issues, just reach out to me or email [propositivityus@gmail.com](mailto:propositivityus@gmail.com) .

My purpose is just to make the world a better place. I have always said I want people to be better off for knowing me. I hope that you are better off for hearing that things get better and this world isn't as bad as our mental illness makes it out to be.

101,"I am lonely, full of trauma and other mental disabilities. I need someone to take care of and to be my best friend. And my best human friends moved states, I need companionship. I need someone to get me out of my bed. I've thought of getting an ESA for a while here and there but I really started considering it recently.

I've been house/dog sitting for my aunt and I had a very emotional experience and connection to one of her dogs. 

I actually cried, I feel like crying a lot but I have a hard time releasing and actually crying so it's like the pain just stayed inside of me. It's a problem, me and my therapist discussed that. But when I started to keep her with me, I connected and I started crying, finally.

It felt like my emotions and pain were transferred to her and disintegrated. I felt comfort, connection, and so much less alone. And I haven't felt that for a long time, or ever.

I feel alone 24/7 no matter who I'm with, but with her it felt like two spirits actually accepting eachother. I was no longer alone.

I feel like I really need this right now. (And yes I do have experience with animals), and I could definitely use some companionship.

&amp;#x200B;

I have always been good at decision making. As life got more complicated and more opaque I have started losing this skill. I reached a point now where I am not able to make the simplest decision. I am mentally paralyzed, which is ironic because I am working in a very analytical role making decisions daily (smart ones).

Root cause maybe that I do not know what really want in life. 

When I was in college, I wanted to graduate. Done.

When I graduated, I want to get the first job. Done.

After the first job, which was not paid well, I wanted to get a well paid job. Done. 

After that I wanted to buy an apartment so I don't waste money on rent. Done.

Then I thought it would be a good idea to pay off my students debt. Done.

After going through this to do list of life I am reaching the end and don't know what to do.

I do not know if that makes sense or if I should wait and how to weigh all the other factors that play a role to make a decision. My girlfriend moved with me (without having a job lined up), so my decision making has a huge impact on her life.

My hair also falls out quite regularly and I’m thinking my hair playing might be contributing to a lot of this as well. 

My psych doc said this along with a few other tics I have are likely a result of ocd, anxiety or my diagnosed add. I take adderall and this only slightly subdues it.

114,"I'm (24f) diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Major Depressive Disorder. I've been sober for over a year. Even though I seem to have the alcoholism under control right now, the depression has been really bad for the past several months. I'm really good at hiding it, though, so most people don't see it or believe it.

Somehow (and I hate myself for how obnoxious this sounds, but I mean it) a great guy has taken interest in me. He doesn't wallow in self-pity and really takes care of himself, which I appreciate a lot, and think could be good for me. The problem is I'm barely functioning but hiding it well. For example, on Monday I slept all day, but whenever I stood up to use the bathroom I was light-headed from not eating, so I eventually ate three pieces of plain white bread. That was all I could stomach, and all I ate all day. I live alone so I can strategically conceal this from people now, but if I end up in this relationship that will be harder. Long-term I'm concerned that I'll be prone to these depressive episodes my whole life, and I don't want to knowingly put him through dealing with me like this for years to come if (best case scenario) we end up together and have a family or other responsibilities.

Does anyone have any advice? I'm concerned he'll think I'm exaggerating about how bad things get and will underestimate how much of a liability I'll be, or he'll (rightfully) get scared and leave. I want to be able to enjoy nice things but don't know how.",12Jul2019,1

116,"2017 was the hardest year of my life, my mother was an acholic and abusive and rarely ever home but when she was I was locked in my room or trying to please her so she wouldnt explode, i did not eat,I heard voices, I was badly bullied at school and called names like Hannah Baker because of a dumb rumor that was being spread around, I barely had any friends and the few I did influenced me to do drugs but made me feel less alone, and my father moved to california with his new family. I was self-harming,depressed,anxious and high all the time. Not to mention the fact I spend almost everyday in the guidance counselor's office talking and pleading about the threats I was getting online and the things that were written on my locker. On june 9th 2017 I was called into the office and once again sat in the guidance counselor's room, he told me that I seemed depressed and that i had lost too much weight and it looked like I haven't showered in days. He was right for the most part. At that point I had tried to kill myself twice but no one besides my “friends” knew. So he called in my mother (my father was visiting from california) so he came too. They were informed to bring me to bellevue hospital for evaluation. After countless hours of interviewing I opened up about my mother and all the things that were going on. They told me I would be in the psych unit for 7-10 days. I was there for 1 month and the day after my 13th birthday I was transferred to another long term hospital 2 hours away and became a CPS kids. In there I still struggled and there was no sign of me getting out to my mother because she refused to sober up. My father stepped in and fought in court to get me out. Built in order to get out I had to move to California with his wife and my half sister (she was like 1) so I accepted the offer. Moving was rough and I did well for a while. I started school and once again met the wrong group of people. I relapsed multiple times and was still in intensive therapy and groups 2 times a week. I started doing drugs again and self-harming. I would have PTSD episodes and severe depressive episodes. I got sent out of school for a few weeks to a mental health focused program instead of school during the day. I was able to pull myself together for a while. Then the summer before highschool I fell back into old habits (again) and my mom was clean at this point. I was visiting her in new york and for once I was the one who was explosive and harming myself. When I came back “home” to sacramento I started highschool and did really well for a long time. Long story short I started dating this crazy guy and he got my back into drugs and shit. School was hard and my parents became relentless about my grades and I felt terrible because of the fights we would have and the fact they took away everything from me including my journals because they “distracted me from my work”. I was in Saturday almost every weekend and became a regular in detention and at one point I got suspended for vandalizing all the bathrooms. So November 16th I overdosed in my bathroom after therapy while my parents were not home. When they arrived I was found on the bethroom floor and I was rushed to the ER and spent what felt like forever there (2 days I think) then I was sent to another psych hospital for 2 weeks. My parents didn't even come to see me and my step mom refused to even talk to me. When my dad picked me up I was overjoyed and when we got home all of my belongings were packed in a suitcase. The next day we had therapy and my step mom informed me that I had to leave and she was kicking my father out with me even though he didn't do anything. I was destroying our family, I was turning into my mother. We agreed that I would have to leave but I would be living in a treatment facility (group home), the first group home they found I would spend the weekends there, I lasted 3 days before I lost my mind completely. I refused to go back. So they sent me to this place (i'm in it right now) and they said if this place did not accept me that I would go to a lockdown facility in Idaho. Long story short I got accepted january 18th 2019 and they said I would only be living here for like 3 months if I stayed on the right track. But the first month I was secretly self harming worse then I had ever done before and eventually got caught. This happened multiple times. After 30 days of living here I was allowed to go home on the weekends to visit my family. In may things started to finally get better after 5 months of being here. Me and my step mom were actually getting along and I felt better, I was on new meds, I gained 20 pounds that I needed and I had been clean for a month. But I relapsed again in mid may when I heard a rumor my mother relapsed. But by June I got everything back together and I felt happy. I started dating a guy that makes me feel like I am not crazy and makes me feel happy, I havent self-harmed in over a month and I will be able to go home in the beginning of august. I never thought I would make it this far.",12Jul2019,1

So, i made this account just to ask for help on what i should do as i think i have bad mental health, im also going to leave out a lot of details due to me not wanting to be identified. sorry for my bad grammar and vocabulary its because im not from an english speaking country and im on phone.   ( im under 17, im not going to reveal my exact age though)

I dont really know how i am supposed to start this thread/post but here we go.

I was bullied from before pre-school... a lot, the worst was from 0 - 3rd grade i would get beat down every break, i wouldn't even try to fight back because i was afraid of breaking rules, i tried to use the rules to get away from some of the bullies, i remember 1 thing very explicitly, it was in year 1 i think in the winter, i accidentally threw a snowball at one of the bullies who were in grade 5 - 7 i dont remember exactly but what i do remember is that as soon as he turned around i knew he and his friends were going to beat me down, so i ran, i ended up being chased into one of the houses on my school, i probably would have gotten away if it wasnt because of how afraid i was of breaking the rules, so i stopped right before i got into the corridors because you werent allowed to wear shoes inside, hoping that they wouldnt break the rule of going inside with shoes.. needless to say, they caught me.

when i was maybe 10 or 9 i tried to kill myself but was stopped by my sister, i later got put into therapy for a long time ( i think all of this really fucked up my mind) and for some reason i am thankful to all my bullies... i have an incredibly high pain tolerance and people cant hurt me with words, but i still have a lot of anger internalized, i some times get urges to kill, i sometimes see possibilities of killing a lot of people... im afraid someday i wont resist, i once jokingly picked up a butcher knife and had to resist the temptation of killing 2 members of my family... please i dont want to contact anyone in real life due to the shame of having to talk about it, it feels like a betrayal even now..

I have paranoia even now, i often suspect to a point of not eating untill after everyone else had finished theirs that the food might be poisoned even if i my mom is the one who cooked it.

Some of my family members especially one of my guardians, is extremely mentally abusive will sometimes after a harsh argument just dissapear in the night.

On some days i have complete self belief, ridiculous amounts of confidence, i literally think i am a god, a genius, a blessing on earth. Other days i feel the complete opposite, i have no self belief, i hate myself, i think im set to fail.

 I feel like i cant talk to my friends- since i got a job in the film industry i've had no time to spend with them. they're not motivated or positive and so it pushes me further away from them. they all smoke weed and waste their time. I have completely gone the other way where if im not working 6-7 days a week, i feel like im wasting my time. but when i do work 6-7 days a week, i feel shit for having no pleasure so i cant win.

 im quite lonely, but im so so so set on my path of being successful that i ignore it. 

since age 17 i've almost conditioned myself to be a filmmaker. refusing any other option at all. This is why i have so much ridiculous confidence, because you have to in order to succeed i believe. But again this confidence is coupled with massive anxiety, fear of failure, self hatred, self deprecation.

129,"Hey there all, not sure where else to go about this, but I figured this would be a good start. As a precursor, I'm on mobile, so I apologize for any poor formatting.

For the past several weeks, I've sensed a change in myself that I feel isn't healthy. I find myself to be apathetic about nearly aspect of my life - even life itself. Some unhealthy tendencies I've noticed recently:

1. I find myself picturing my death more frequently. Usually in the form of a self-inflicted GSW or car crash. To clarify this, I don't desire death, it's more that I'm apathetic to the idea. Whether I live or die, I couldn't be bothered.

2. I lack motivation for most given tasks. Furthermore, social interaction seems like a chore to me. This is not the norm, as I've been a pretty outgoing kid most of my life.

3. I find myself ""faking"" emotional response. In short, it feels as though every exclamation mark, and every other sense of emotion I show (in communicating with friends and family) is forced.

Some background information about me:

I'm a 19-year-old male, I've been through my first year of college, and my grades were not great. I'm physically very fit, but I can barely find the motivation to workout anymore. I have no previous history of depression or suicidal tendencies. However, I broke up with my girlfriend of nearly 3 years last winter. I felt I was pretty much past that, though.

I just don't know what to do. I don't even know what this is. I'm hesitant to call it depression, because it's simply an overwhelming sense of meaninglessness and ambivalence. I've spoken to one or two close friends about it, and I've come to the idea that I need to just live my life until I can find something I'm passionate about, but that's becoming increasingly strenuous, as I no longer have a passion for life itself.

136,"I guess this actually started way back when I just came out of high school and suddenly realized that I might not like the university program I was about to start after summer. Since then I've been dealing with this off and on but it's been reaching an all-time low now. For the record, I've dropped out of uni to 'find myself', failed and started another program I wasn't sure about and here I am questioning the hell out of my life. 

But by questioning what I'd like to do in my life, my mind very quickly shifts to trying to find meaning and reasons for everything. To be real, I feel so lost about my place in the world that I really don't see any real reason to keep living. Ultimate nihilism you could say. I can't focus anymore on any work for school and it's affected my performance greatly. I was really well on track until the last quarter, until I kinda burned out and completely botched the fourth and last of the year. Right now I'm scrambling points to even be allowed to continue after the summer and I'm having such a hard time trying to figure out if I'm doing the right thing with my life.

Questions of what I'm passionate about shifted really quickly to questions of what my purpose on earth is. And from there, with the help of a few vlogs on YouTube and a few documentaries about activism I started questioning everything I believed in. I discovered my views on the way the world works are so ultimately hopeless that I can't do what I truly want to do while doing what I truly believe is good for the world. What I enjoy doing is contradictory to what I think is the right thing to do. And by doing what I believe is truly good for the world, I'd be hurting many other people with a different opinion. 

We're dealing with so many problems as society to which the solutions are direct trade-offs, where one side gets silenced or hurt while the other will win. My belief in putting everyone's well-being first and my problem-solving brain can't handle this. You'll always upset someone else with what you're doing, hurting someone else, contributing to a 'bad' practice or directly damaging the world we leave behind that my mind can't handle it anymore. 

People always say that you can't just please everyone and they're right. Someone will have to bite the bullet at some point. But for some reason I just can't accept that. I always hate trade-offs for this exact reason, even when simply buying something new. I can't accept that there isn't a solution that fixes both problems without creating any new ones.

Right now my mind is just going crazy about this. I can't focus on anything anymore and I'm stressed out about finishing all my work in time. I can't enjoy things anymore because I'll always find a reason why what I'm doing is bad. I've heard about all the advice there is by now and I've just become numb to it. The only thing I'm left wondering is whether this is the cause of a burn-out, depression, anxiety or some other mental disorder that can be fixed or that I just have to accept it and move the fuck on already. I ***wish*** I could blame this on something so that I can have a good reason to talk to a therapist about it without worrying and feeling guilty for wasting their time because it's not their job to handle. It's been fucking up my life for the past few years, making me crazy unhappy at times and even bringing me to frequent thoughts of suicide and the fucked up thing is that I feel like I should just get out there and experience life to solve it. BUT FUCKING HOW when I can't even ask the store clerk for a discount I'm entitled to without feeling nervous the whole day before. I know I have anxiety and I even went to therapy for it but I never felt like I could share this with my therapist because it wasn't the same issue even though it kinda is related but it still has nothing to do with each other.... God fucking damn I feel like I'm losing my mind and I just have no clue what to do anymore.

I should've been referred to a new therapist but I've been waiting for that call for the last three weeks now... I don't want to go to the doctor because I feel like they'd just dismiss it. I feel very nervous about calling back myself asking why the hell I haven't heard anything yet and even if I got an appointment with a new therapist, which, mind you, I'm being referred to because my other one suspected there are deeper problems going on, I have no clue how to even tackle this topic without, again, feeling guilty and manipulative. I'm just stuck in this loop and I have been for the past half year now...

Long story short: I need educational resources on developmentally delayed adults who are acting out violently. What kind of disorders are common, how are they treated, what the family can do to help, and which behaviors require immediate medical intervention (or literally anything you think might be helpful) 
**We live in the greater Bay Area, near San Francisco CA 

Here is my situation: 
My husband and I are both in college and rent a room in his mother’s home. We are young (21 and 22). My husbands sister *Nat lives in the room next to ours and she is turning 19 soon. 
This is a family that communicates very little, they are in denial of the severity of Nat’s problems. However they are very wealthy and have the means to get the best treatment. 
My mother and father in-law are in the middle of a nasty 4 year long divorce. All of the issues you can imagine from bad mouthing the other parent to a lack of any consistency to general neglect of their (3) kids have occurred and continue to. 
I have been offer “employment” from my mother in-law to basically babysit Nat (I am a certified infant caregiver and was a nanny for years but do not have any kind of special needs training) 

So that’s a very quick version just to give some background for anyone. On to the problems..

About Nat (obviously not her real name): 
She was born in Russia and adopted from an orphanage at 9mo. She was dying of malnutrition and so thin that apparently her beating heart was visible through her chest. My information is not perfect because I’ve only been told things second hand from my husband so bear with me. I believe she was diagnosed with development delays but I’m not sure when, by whom, or what treatment plan was followed if any. According to my husband she has always behaved as if she was 8-10 years younger than she actually is. 
Since I have know her for the past 2 years here is what I have noticed in regards to developmental issues
. Major hygiene problems 
. Learning difficulty 
. Slow cognition 
. Child like hobbies, interests, clothing choices etc. 

More importantly she also has severe behavioral problems. My husband has called her bi-polar. She has tried medication but her mother didn’t think it helped and pulled her off. Nat is currently seeing a therapist (not helping, she is more violent both before and after a session) but is no longer seeing a psychiatrist. She is not seeing a psychiatrist  (read: not taking medication) anymore because he 5150’d Nat and that upset the mother. 

As a woman who has struggled with GAD, major depression, OCD and more I have some knowledge about mental health symptoms, but I’m not a doctor. 

Nat’s behavior is erratic, unpredictable, and frankly terrifying. I believe that from her behavior there is clearly a much larger issue than bipolar disorder. She does show signs of going through manic cycles (won’t sleep for days, talking to herself all night long, believes she is a witch and has powers) but her depressive cycles are not super pronounced. I’ll notice some apathy and less energy (she takes naps , and mostly watches tv) but she still becomes extremely violent regardless. 

This violence is verbal and physical. This is my main concern and what I need more education and advice about (also thank you for reading this far). I’m going to break these behavior into two categories for ease

Verbal: 
Name calling (I’m the gold digger, whore, slut, or stupid bitch. My husband is the dumbass, dumb shit, fucker, whore.... everyone gets the same treatment) 
Threats to others (wants to kill us in our sleep, shoot my husband) 
Threats to property ( burning the house down, breaking every object of value) 
Threats to self (wants to kill herself with knives, medication, getting hit by a car, jumping off roof, hanging self) 
Obsession with using hate speech (racial slurs, homophobic statements, “I love hitler” and “I think hitler was awesome” are daily) 

Physical: 
Destroys property 
Throws objects at others 
Hits, kicks, scratches others 
Some self harm (personally I believe Nat’s cutting /scratching is fully attention seeking rather than a form of self punishment, an attempt to numb, or a means to suicide) 
Graffiti (she draws / carves swastikas into everything, leaves notes with death threats or wishes) 

The verbal violence is a constant, the physical is maybe 1-2 times a week 
It’s hard to describe just how angry she seems all the time. She doesn’t seem to feel much empathy for humans so she will purposely does mean things, steals from us, tells me she hopes I die in a car crash every time I leave the house. She has an obsession with God, and seems to be especially fond of saying “God is a piece of shit” and “God can burn in Hell”. She is also constantly (and I mean 20+ times a day) talking about how she wants to kill herself. She talks about her plans to do it, and just generally that her life is terrible, that we are harassing / abusing her, that we hate her. Then she’ll switch to talking about how she hates us, and that we can’t help her. She says she doesn’t want help and that we can’t keep her from hurting herself or us. Then it switches back to the fact that we’re not doing enough to keep her safe because she’s still able to find the knives/meds/ rope etc that we’ve had to lock up. And back and forth for hours. 

Being the in-law I try to ignore the passing comments (ex. I walk in the door after work and hear “oh great you dumb  bitches are here) or tell I her it’s not okay to say “insert phrase here”. If she says something really cruel I will tell her “that’s not an appropriate  thing to say, how would you feel if I said that to you.” I have tried just letting her get it all out, being understanding, trying to make her laugh, I’ve shared my own struggles with her in hopes that she won’t feel so alone. 

I could keep going on and on but basically I’m lost. She’s never had consistent mental health care, and things are getting consistently worse. She just graduated high school and refuses to do a special community college program that her mother found. Of course my mother in-law didn’t fight her on this, she just gives in and then takes her shopping to make Nat feel better. (Read: All negative behavior is rewarded) 

I’ve been trying to put together a document so that I can talk to my husband and eventually the whole family.  So far I have been tracking what I would call her mania, the date and symptoms I see. I have also been recording some of the threats and things she says so I can at least get a somewhat accurate figure on how often and when.  The problem I’m running into is research. I need to have solid medical evidence that the things going on are not normal, dangerous, and are hurting Nat in the long run. She’s miserable and in truth we are not caring for her properly. Her mental health is being neglected and that’s just not right. I’m covered in physical scars and have irreversible liver damage because I have been in a similar kind of darkness. I want to pull her out so badly, I want her to know she’s loved, but we’re not sure if she has the ability to understand that.  

Like I said there is very little communication in the family so any resources or advice on how to even begin approaching this would be so greatly appreciated.  

All the information I have been able to find on her specific behaviors has been about children (under 10 usually). It’s somewhat helpful but the circumstances are different for a grown woman (think periods, the sanitation that comes with that, the possibility of pregnancy, getting involved with manipulative people since she has full internet access and a loaded debit card, just her general strength and ability to actually hurt people) 

  
If anyone has a similar story please share, you can message me too if you like. I just need to know there’s hope.",12Jul2019,2
140,"Hey Reddit 

I don’t know if this the right subreddit, I’m still quite new to this place. 

I wanted to ask about something that’s been on my mind a lot recently. I’m 33, I know that’s still young and in many ways I feel young. I’m a full time jazz musician and I love what I do and I think music keeps you young in a lot of ways. But what I’m here for is that I’ve felt a really strange shift in the last year, maybe more. I don’t feel like I’m funny anymore, when I really did through my twenties. I’ve always had a dry sense of humour but I’ve always been very silly and goofy and made lots of people laugh. But the problem is that I feel like I’ve just lost it this last year or more and I can’t pinpoint why. I’m not depressed, I’m pretty happy. I did go through some trauma over the last 2 years but I don’t really feel that affected by it mentally, I don’t think about it or feel emotional about it so I don’t think it’s that. 

I also listen to a lot of comedy still and try to make sure my mental input isn’t to negative. I do wonder if the world has got a bit darker for everyone the last two years. 

What I’m asking is - is this normal for my age? I know your twenties are meant to be more wild but is this just the same thing? Has anyone else gone through this? Will it come back? Thanks in advance for any replies and I can only apologise if this is a bit of a self-centred  moan fest :)",12Jul2019,2
141,"Ok, so, this is something that I've only ever done twice. Once when my best friend of five years was ignoring me, and I felt I was in competition to get her attention, and now, when I'm on a family trip, my mom has been coddling my sister and practically ignoring the rest of my family, and my sister has made it a competition for my moms attention. (Wow run on sentence). I am also still working on residual separation anxiety from my mom back from early childhood, so this thing has obviously boded well for me. (Can you smell the sarcasm yet?) I could genuinely go on for days about what a pain in the ass my sister has been for the past few months, but that's not what this is about. 
So, as I mentioned, this isnt something that has happened to me often, and it's usually because I'm just overwhelmed by emotions for one reason or another (in this case, my sister causing literal rage, and feeling very, very lonely), and I shut down. 
I like to say that it's when I ""go comatose,"" because that's practically what it is. Around certain people, or combinations thereof (i.e. mom &amp; sister; 'best friend' &amp; her best friend), I become very unresponsive. I get very spacey, quiet (I'm not a talkative person to begin with, so that's saying a lot), and I give short answers to any comments or questions from people. I also stay away from people and try to get as far away from the people causing my comatose as possible. Not easy when you're in a foreign country, and your dad is adamant about grouping up. Only certain people have ever been able to drag me out of my comatose state, and only when bot around the people who are causing it. In the case of my 'best friend,' my two closest guy friends were able to get me to talk and be more myself, and in the case of my family, only my dad and brother have been able to do the same. 
I think it stems from my brain going ""ThEy CaNt IsOlAtE mE if I iSoLaTe MySeLf fIrSt,"" and I cant tell if it's a healthy coping mechanism or not. Does anyone else do it? Am I just extra crazy? What can I do instead?
Cause it's not like I can talk to anyone about it. My mom will just deny that shes been ignoring everyone else in the family because my sister has been throwing bitch fits left right and center, whilst my sister starts to have a meltdown that ""MoM'S bEeN iGnOrInG mE tHiS wHoLe TrIp!!1!!!1!"" and my dad would get mad at me for making my sister upset. 👍",12Jul2019,1
142,"In April after waiting several months my appointment for a psychological evaluation arrived. I went in and from the beginning the psychologist performing the evaluation seemed to be annoyed with me since I self referred myself, when I went back for results two weeks later he concluded that I fit the criteria for ASD. At the end he asked me if I wanted a copy of the written report and I kinda shrugged my shoulders not really caring. I got the answer I was looking for. He then commented something along the lines that I would need it for the county for when I go in there. I love my job, I make decent money, and have better insurance than what medicaid covers. Why would I be going to the county? I was not and am not being a 'disability chaser'. I follow his advice and start searching out a therapist I felt I would be comfortable with, and finally got an appointment made. There was an eight week wait time to get in, and two weeks prior to the first appointment I get a call that the therapist is leaving OP practice in August so I will only be able to get a few appointments with my choice and then he will set me up with someone he feels is a good fit. I have my first appointment and tell him that I believe in a conservative Christian belief on sexuality and am gay so I believe celibacy. Therapist begins mocking the conservative belief and those that believe in it. The next day I get a call from there office asking me to set up appointments with the new therapist. The new therapist is there *LGBT specialist* that he wants to set me up with. The new therapist is also a female which I personally would not feel comfortable with especially talking to on an emotionally raw level. Now I don't even want to continue with the therapist that I chose because he didn't seem to take in consideration what is important to me, just what he *knows* to be the best solution. I'd have been off if I never tried to resolve my mental health issues and just continued to white knuckle it like I have for 20 years. 

Also doing a virtual counseling through betterhelp that I started while waiting for the 8 weeks to pass. That counselor keeps telling me to reframe my thoughts. I'm sorry but like we have found out that doesn't work when the root of the problem is a fact you want me to reframe. Ie lie to myself rather than force the shitty truth onto myself.",12Jul2019,0
