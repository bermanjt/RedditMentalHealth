0,"So I was having a pretty good day. I got to work, got my opening stuff done like normal, got myself a sandwich from the bakery down the hall and a nice maple latte. Later my boss came in to get some things ready for tomorrow. He left me a card and a chocolate bar. The card thanked me for being so helpful and patient with him in the few months he's owned the business. The card had $200 inside. I almost started crying when I saw it. I was feeling very lucky and awestruck at the gesture. Later on, once I finished up at work, I messaged my sister letting her know I was done and ready to come home. She ignored me. Which I understand. She told me if my nephew came over she wouldn't be coming to get me. But she could have at least said something back. I've been sitting on the couch in the lobby of my work feeling drained and miserable while my phone plays an anti-depression playlist. I wanted to just curl up and fall asleep. I didn't let myself. I texted my other sister asking if she was busy, she is. I texted my roommate asking for a ride home when she gets out of work, no answer. I've been sitting here about an hour and my sister just asked if I still need a ride home then asked where I was like I would have anywhere else to go right now. I want to tell her what's going on with me. But she's very much the ""suck it up, buttercup"" type, and that isn't what I need right now. I need a hug and to listen to to my music and just be home.",25Dec2019,1
1,"The fact that you went through traumatic experiences doesn't mean you have mental illnesses. There are no such things as mental disorders. Your worldview and beliefs were so drastically changed that it seems to outside people that you ve gone mad, when in reality you ve just realised the truth of this life. Happy people are ignorant. Happy people don't ask questions. Happy people lie to themselves. Happy people are delusional. Being smart amd aware is both a blessing and a curse. I wish you the best",25Dec2019,1

4,"Hey y'all, just needed advice on a situation. If this post is not supposed to be here, pls lmk where I should post it.

About 6 months ago while I was abroad, one of my closest friends (who I never could have imagined falling apart, being as strong as he is) started having mental health issues, and another friend texted me that he was really struggling. Having been diagnosed with depression/anxiety/bipolar disorder myself,  I reached out to him and asked what was going on. He told me he had been depressed and really anxious, and had a breakdown just the week prior. 

About a month before his breakdown, we had taken a large amounts of drugs (including LSD), and I thought that this had some sort of connection to his breakdown, as he later told me he hadn't quite felt the same afterwards (unrelated note: he used to be quite religious and had an existential crisis a couple years ago too). Anyways, I gave him all the advice that had worked for me in the past, and worked hard to stay in contact with him. A week later, I began waking up to texts from him of pure gibberish, ranging from existential fears to just non-english (english words but not in any order). I got really worried, but again, as I was abroad I felt helpless and could only skype/text with him. Eventually he recovered from this state, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder I (hence his manic episode), and began medication. 

Eventually we reconnected, but I could tell things were just not the same. He looked completely out of it, and I could tell (especially from my own experience) that he was really depressed. He stopped going to the gym, participating in schoolwork, and doing anything that he loved before. He had no interest in life in general, and continuously talked about death. I knew these were early signs of suicide, so my friend and I intervened and had long discussions with him. We learned that his manic episode was much much worse than we knew (he had to be hospitalized for nearly two weeks, during which he said he didn't know who he was and remembers very little of). 

He told us recently that this disconnected state entirely due to his medication, and that he feels depressed as a result (his words ""it's like being bipolar without the highs and only the lows"").  I tried to get him involved in his passions again, and while this helps very slightly, he just seems to have very little interest. I would do anything to help him and get the ""old him"" back. I just feel so helpless, and despite me knowing that what helps one person doesn't necessarily help someone else, I'm really worried that things are never going to improve and that one day he might kill himself. What can I do??

TL;DR: Friend had mental breakdown, got prescribed medication for bipolar I disorder, says medication causes a strong side effect of depression. He feels like it's the only thing keeping him sane, but also said when he's on the medication it causes him to have no interest in life. I have tried to support as much as possible, but need advice on concrete things I can do to help.",25Dec2019,1
5,"Here's my story.

Earlier this month, I met a woman on Tinder. Of course, there will be no names or location or anything. This woman was about 3 years younger than me, and I'm in my mid-late 20's. She was very cute.  
Everyone knows Tinder is mostly for hookups and flings, but I'm not usually ready for those types of things, not right away, and have no experience with them. So when I messaged her, I just tried to be friendly. It turns out, she was into poetry, so it was interesting trading poems we liked and reading her poetry, as well. I thought things were promising, so after we got a little comfortable trading messages, I asked her out. Well, i said, ""Let's hang out"", to take the edge off, but it was basically a date.  
It almost didn't happen, due to work schedules and weather. I had to be persistent, which makes me feel like a huge creep. But apparently, she appreciated that I kept trying to make something happen. Most guys, it turns out, give up quick.  
For some reason, she trusted me enough to give me her address and asked me to pick her up, which I sort of did. It was weird, and totally unexpected. We went to a local sculpture garden, and started talking and walking.  
I'm weird. I made that obvious. I say weird things that are on my mind. And when I said them, she looked at me with these gorgeous brown eyes, and I think, more than anyone I ever knew, she understood me.  
It turns out, she was weird, too, and not ashamed of it. She struggles with mental illness that is really more serious than what I have, but somehow she remains independent, willful, intelligent. I really began to admire her.  
We went to a cafe, which she quickly paid for before I got out my debit card. What kind of girl does that? One who does not give a shit about expectations. She knew she made more money than me, but I could tell she was starting to really like me, and didn't mind at all.  


I eventually drove her home. We went up the steps, and it seemed awkward at first saying goodbye. Then she just dropped it: ""Can I kiss you?"". I think I must have stammered, and said ""Yea! sure"". She kissed me. We made out a little. It was the first kiss I had had in over 7 months, since my last relationship. She tasted like cigarette ash and it all excited me out of my mind. Literally, it was almost an out-of-body experience. I was too unsure to move forward with anything else, but she stilled seemed to like me.  


We finally said goodbye and I went home. I was so, so happy. I was so, so excited. And I was terrified. Since my last relationship, things had been so sad for me. I became extremely depressed, had thought about suicide and hurting myself, and felt totally alone. I had talked with other women, but none of them clicked with me at all. I even got stood up for a date. But now I met someone that I liked, that clearly liked me, and I knew she could hurt me.  


The next morning, to my surprise, she wanted my help shopping and we got coffee. We opened up a lot, about our past relationships, our families, our lives. She was so sassy, so kind at the same time, and so fuckin smart. I knew I was becoming totally taken and infatuated, and wondered if she felt anything close to that for me. I doubt it, but I think she was willing to accept me. We went back to her place, and hung out and talked for a while before she got ready for work.  


The next day, I could tell I was becoming too attached. I kept messaging her and I felt annoying, but I seemed to have trouble stopping myself. I don't have many friends, especially ones that have time for me. Eventually, I think my suffocating and obnoxious comments and jokes got to her. She messaged me, ""I'm busy. Bye"".  


I knew I had screwed it up. I always screw things up. I'm too OCD to leave things alone, they possess my mind and make it impossible to sit still and do nothing. My mind was racing, I started crying. Why did I always find a way to get in the way of my own happiness? Now I had shown myself as boring and stupid, rather than interesting. I sent an apology text, but there was no reply, which filled my brain with obsessive thoughts. Was she tired of me? Were we not going to talk anymore?  


The next morning, still no response, I felt so depressed and anxious. I knew it was over. It always happened, and I always become a distant memory to the people I meet. I didn't want to be forgotten again. I wrote a poem about my feelings, and told myself I would send it to her house if she didn't ever message me back.  
I told myself that, and I sat.  
And then I put it in my pocket and walked halfway to my car, about to hand-deliver it to her place. I said to myself, ""Go back inside and calm down. This is not a big deal. You should send it in the mail, anyway.""  


So I went back inside and sat down and tried to distract myself. I tried, and tried, and tried and tried. My brain felt like it was on fire. My mind was burning and racing with thoughts and it made it impossible to do anything. If I didn't do anything, right now, I would go insane for the anticipation. My OCD and anxiety took over, and I made a bad, bad decision. I can't blame everything on my mental illness. We all make choices, and I chose not to wait it out. I chose not to let it go.  


I drove to her place and dropped the letter off on her front step. Like a maniac. Like a stalker. Like a fuckin loser.  
I went to the gym to try to get my mind off things.  


She messaged me about 2 hours later. ""Did you seriously come to my house unannounced?"" ""You fucking creep. I'm afraid of you."" ""Don't talk to me again. Bye""  


NOW I had screwed it up. I went home, buried my face and cried. How do I keep doing this? With romantic partners, with friends, with strangers even, I somehow, in some way, screw it up. I couldn't believe I had met someone that I thought I connected with so much, and I screwed it up. But even worse, I made someone terrified of me. The thought of her, being afraid of being STALKED now, made me nauseated. I tried to message her and reassure her that I understood, that I would not talk to her again and that I was not a danger. I thought that was the end.  


Things got... weirder. Someone ELSE sent her a letter, containing a poem (not written, a print-out of a Bukowski poem. Why?) and she accused me. I asked her, desperately, to believe me, that I didn't send that letter. I had no idea what was going on. Did a neighbor see my letter and decide to copy me? Was it someone she had shown my letter to? Did SHE do it, to scare me? She insisted it was me, and I got angry. I called her conceited. I told her she didn't care about anyone but herself. She threatened to call a lawyer or the police. That shut me up. I realized that all I was to her was a monster.  


I told my friends, my ex (who I'm friendly with), my new therapist. They've all told me to forgive myself. It's hard to. I didn't just make a mistake. I think I hurt someone. I know I scared someone. And of course, I fucked up a chance at being friends (or more) with someone totally unique and wonderful. And now I was nothing more than a stalker, a creep.  


But I know I have to move on. I can't take back my mistakes, and I can't keep trying to apologize to someone who doesn't trust me and told me to leave them alone. They will eventually recover. I have to try and recover, and look forward to the future. But I need more help. I know I will keep screwing things up if I let my brain sabotage things. I'm getting therapy, and I'm taking it day-by-day.  


If you've destroyed your chances at happiness, for whatever reason, please keep hoping. You will get another chance. Keep working on yourself. And most importantly, forgive yourself, no matter how much pain you're in. You will someday make someone very happy.",25Dec2019,1

7,"I've heard that these people can't change, but I really want hope... I really want to know if it's possible, although I don't even know why. It's not like I have any clue in how to help the person I have in mind. She's my mom, age 46. Maybe 47, idk. Her mental health have been declining throughout my life. I think once my little brother was born, shit really hit the fan. Although she was saying how she sees my dad, who died at the time- aka her husband. She was saying shit to ME, 13 at the time, all smiling and manic, how she had a dream where she cut off my baby brother's fucking penis. She was also having major mood swings prior as well.

But either way, she's really not here, on this planet, anymore. She is in complete denial about her current situation. She thinks I'm a fucking demon, like.. an actual evil spirit. She hears people and sees things, I gave overheard her crying and arguing outside many times to her BF. Everyone knows... She's psychotic.. but I just ... I don't know, I've been thinking things. I've been planning things, I just want to know if there's any hope she can be okay and get rid of any of what she's feeling and seeing and just... Yeah.",25Dec2019,1
8,"I have been really struggling this past year and I dont know what to do. Long story short I upped and moved my mom, bf and pets out to Phoenix from Boston because we were sick of the snow. We bought an amazing house by the lake and I am now 3 months pregnant by all pretence life should be good. But every night I want to cry myself to sleep, I spent a good portion of the year being suicidal and no mental health doctors have been helpful thus far. Everyday I go to work where I sit in an office all alone and have no friends to talk to. I come home by 5 to listen to my mom bitch about whatever OCD complaint she has that day. She is disabled so I care for her. My boyfriend hides in his office till 9pm and I spend the whole night alone bored watching reruns of the same movies HBO airs all year long that I dont even like anymore because I've seen them so many times. I have no friends here and every day is just such a struggle. I used to be military flying of the seat of my pants doing one crazy thing after the next, and now my life is relatively disappointing. I dont know where to start or what to do to help my situation. I want to sell the house and move back home but they refuse. I'm planning to get a gym membership Saturday to atleast get me out of the house. I'm afraid to bring a kid into a world that has me so depressed so I gotta figure out something.

15,"This happened maybe 30 minutes ago, idk I’ve lost track of time. So I work as a bartender in a pretty already busy bar, I’ve been there for six months now so I’m very use to things by now. But this evening when I started my shift we were jammed pack. It was overwhelming, but I was fine and was keeping up with drinks and even had time to talk with customers. But then apparently I messed up this one guys’ drink and he was getting annoyed real fast and from there is where it started. I don’t remember much, it’s all kind of a daze looking back now. From what I do remember I don’t think I felt panic, everything just seemed glazed over. My heart started to beat fast and hurt and everything sounded muffled, like I was hearing everything around me from a separate room. I felt detached maybe? My vision just felt glazed, it seemed fuzzy, and darker. I thought I was going to pass out. Again I don’t remember feeling panicked, but I was worried because I’ve never felt that way before and knew it was not good. I just remember briefly bracing myself on my coworkers shoulder and telling them I had to sit down. I stumbled into the back, nearly tripping over myself and bracing myself on the wall because I was dizzy and my legs felt, I don’t know, barely there and weak. Once I sat down I started to feel better. I just tried to focus on my breathing because my heart was still hurting and I was breathing fast. All this that happened at the bar happened in a matter of maybe a minute at max. After a few more minutes of sitting down I felt normal again, got up and walked around just to double check if I was really okay. Once I was sure I walked back out to go back to work. I apologized to my coworker for bailing when it was busy, but when I walked back up to the bar to get back to it, it immediately all started back over again. I went back and sat down and again, only a few minutes later for me to feel normal again.  I tried to go back out to work, but my boss was worried about me and told me to go home.

18,"I’m really jealous and obsessive over people and it’s causing me so much sadness and depression. If I like someone I become really possessive and if I see them doing anything fun without me I get really sad, angry, and jealous. Even if they’re just simply talking to or hanging out with their family.

I have this friend who I secretly really like, and we used to talk on the phone constantly. As soon as we’d both get home, we’d get on the phone and talk all night until we went to sleep. Now, she never calls me at all. I still talk to her everyday and we’re super close but we don’t talk as much as we used to and it makes me incredibly sad and angry.

I know she isn’t obliged to talk to me every second of the day, but I just feel really sad. It makes me wonder if she’s just bored of me or if she found someone else she likes more to talk to now.

Christmas makes me feel like trash because was in this day that she erased all trace of her in my life I tried to talk to her again but she is so bright and I’m at the real bottom and I think she avoids me she always says “oh sorry I’m busy with the college” even in vacations i know that those day won’t come back but I just wish that for one moment everything goes back to those days

30,"Hi this is my first post on reddit and I decided to make an account because the people here seem really supportive and helpful.

Anyway, I’m a freshman at college and I feel like everything I’ve built over my lifetime is failing apart. When I was in high school I felt like I had everything set up to do well in life - I had a 3.6 gpa, a 36 on the ACT,  played football for the varsity team and was generally liked by most people. Recently, however, I’ve been struggling to keep myself motivated to do much and my gpa for my first semester of college was a 2.2. I know I’m capable of so much better but I just can’t seem to get myself to do the work anymore. I’m also having a hard time making an effort to talk to people and any social situation usually ends up with me zoning out and people leaving cause they think I’m weird or rude. I’ve probably cried more in these last few months than I can remember in the rest of my life and in those times I’m sure that there is something wrong with me, but there are times when I feel good and I feel stupid for even thinking that. So far I haven’t talked to anybody about this but I am at home over winter break and I’m thinking of telling my parents about this but I don’t know if this is just me being lazy or if I actually need to get help. I’m also a little scared of how they will respond because I’ve never confided anything this personal to them before and I know that where they grew up, mental illnesses aren’t always considered “real”.
Any advice from you guys would be helpful.
Also if you need clarification on something I’ll try to respond.

Thanks",25Dec2019,1
31,"So one of my best friends recently broke up with their girlfriend, and she's always been bad mentally but now it's worse than it's ever been. She lives in an abusive household so that's very degrading on her mental health as well. Lately I feel like she's using me as her therapist, since she can't get a real one because of her home situation. She only talks about her own issues, and whenever I even try to talk to her about something in my life, she either turns the conversation to be about herself or just gives half assed responses. I feel like she only cares about me because I'm a vessel for all of her problems. She constantly comes at me with family conflicts and whenever I try to help in any way she always yells at me and makes me feel like I'm not doing the right thing. This has been so draining on my mental health and I can't keep up.",25Dec2019,1
32,"I just got some mail from my therapist's counseling place and it said that my therapist is no longer working with them. They assigned a new therapist for me...

I don't like it. I was trying to work with her on a plan for my loneliness and stuff and now she's gone and I don't have anyone except this new therapist. One of the first things she told me back when I  was having back downs and said I have no one was ""You've got me"".

But now I have no one and it scares me because I don't have anyone else to talk to except a new therapist that I don't know and who might not work with me very well... now my family might have to see me like this.  
They actually emailed me on the 20th apparently, but I didn't see it until today. I've never had a therapist or counselor that was actually good like her. I was thinking about calling a crisis line or using crisis text, but they're probably already overworked and, since I've done it so many times in the past, it seems formulaic and cold now.

I called a ""warm line"" and left my number, but I don't think they'll call me back.  
I almost felt like I didn't need help any more, but now I do... She used to talk about how I had so much to talk about how can I just be transferred over like this when I'm still so lonely and unhappy?",25Dec2019,1

So I have psoriasis on my scalp you can’t see it much unless I show it or pull my hair back but I’m feeling really sad about it cause there’s not much I can do and it hurts and itchy and if just makes me feel gross. I know people can’t see it but it’s taunting like it looks all fine but then I itch my head and it looks like a winter storm on my shoulder. It just makes me feel unattractive and uncomfortable I hate it and people say oh it’ll go away with time but it’s getting worse. I got it some what under control but it’s still bad and it makes me feel bad. It doesn’t help that my boyfriend isn’t here to comfort me like usual idk I just feel so bad and I feel even worse cause it’s Christmas Eve I’m supposed to be happy and feel the magic but after looking at my scalp in the mirror before bed... i feel worse. It’s just a big white Calais on my head and if I don’t scrap it off with a comb it gets even worse but my scalp just always hurts. I just am tired of feeling gross and not attractive.

I'm in the process of moving so I can be away from this situation but like. Everyone I love. Why does this happen with everyone I love? I've been through therapy and I know I have a real big problem with letting people convince me that I'm crazy but like. It hurts less. It hurts so much less if this makes sense and I deserve it. 

My gran is the only person I have left, I can detach myself from abusive parents and step-parents and adoptive parents and be independent, well-adjusted, happy, but why do I need to believe in her good intentions so badly? Why is everyone so casually okay with using me as a coping mechanism?  You should have seen her face. I can't describe it. How on Earth... do I carry on and believe that there's nothing wrong with me? Giving in and believing her would be so much easier. Then I'd still have someone who cares. 

I don't feel this way normally but I feel so worthless and I'm so confused about how much I hate myself for existing right now, it hurts. I'm not planning to do anything I just can't see or feel anything else right now. Why can't she see when I'm in pain? Even when I tell her. There's no empathy in her face. But she acts so sweet.

44,"Just going to drop this in the order I think of it now, sorry if it's chaotic.

In early May was the first time I felt *truly* depressed. This was back in Canada, where I went to visit some of my friends there. It honestly felt like a dream: Ever since my dad passed away back in 2012 I kinda ""lost"" my family with it. I'd like to blame all of that on my family, but I can't say I've been trying too hard to get them back.

A few years later I got into Twitch, and it was a place where I felt truly accepted: I've always been an outsider, but on Twitch, I felt like I could really be me. I've 'travelled' a lot around Twitch but there's a few communities where I've settled. I've grown really close to these people, to the point where I like to call them ""my actual family."" Anyway, earlier this year I decided I'd go visit them, I ""had the money"" and there was a meetup planned where we could all hang out. As I said, it felt like a dream, it had been a long time since I felt *so* at home. Skip to the next day, I wake up, and next thing I know I'm sitting in the shower crying about the fact this is a life I might never have.

The reason I was ""able"" to go to Canada in May was because I didn't have uni. But I was supposed to. I was supposed to fix an internship for that half year, the next thing on my study schedule. However, for the past two years, there's just been a lot of times where I've been sabotaging myself. Looking for this internship was one of those, I kept postponing it until the moment where I was too late. No internship, meaning I can't do anything for the next half year. But hey, I had a fair amount of tests I had to retake because I failed them (guess what, I postponed studying for them, or working on them), so I just told my family ""I had chosen to take this half year to retake those tests I had failed previously,"" not mentioning I had just not searched for an internship.

Anyway, I came to talk with some friends for Canada and they were talking about a Twitch meetup happening in May. At first I was joking I would come, but at some point I was just thinking ""Why not? I don't have uni right now -"" I didn't have to redo my tests until June ""- I have the money, I might as well go."" So I went to Canada, had the meetup, feel completely depressed the next day. I should mention the crying wasn't just the only thing at that point. My feeling depressed is something I would describe as how you feel when you're sick, completely tired, and just feel like crying, except there was no way to get better, because ""I wasn't actually sick"" (physically, I guess).

I managed to get myself better before the flight back, took it, and ""slept the rest off."" At this point I had quit my job: I had a Saturday-job on the side, and quit this in April, because I wasn't feeling it anymore, and it would save me from taking time off for my Canada-trip. I promised myself I would look for a job after I came back, but I never did. I started spending basically all my time on Twitch, because that's where I felt good. Basically all streamers I follow are ET (timezone), 6 hours behind me in CET: Hey, I don't really have a job anyway, why not just adjust my sleep schedule to ET, and be able to watch more streams. So, that's what I did.

Not much really happened then, I was feeling great spending all my time at those streams, and didn't really see a problem. Problems started when uni started again back in September. I had to start retaking my project I did late 2018 (the semester *before* the internship), I had failed it because of not having written a proper ""justification report,"" (you basically write down *what* you did, when, and describe how all these things show you should pass), because (surprise!) I had started on my report way too late. Anyway, the first 7 weeks were fine, I only had 1 class per week, in the afternoons, so it would still work with my ET sleep schedule.

Then, by now almost two months ago. I got sick. Actually sick (question mark?). It was the week *before* I would have to go full-time on the project. (First 8 weeks are preparation). Anyway, I felt terrible stomach cramps and nausea. I went to my General Practitioner to have it checked out. He suggest some nausea-medicine: didn't help. Checked for parasites, found possible ""badly behaving"" bacteria, got antibiotics: didn't help. Tested for gluten allergy through blood tests, stopped consuming dairy to see if I might be lactose intolerant: didn't help. I went to my GP again, and I'm now scheduled for intestinal examination at the hospital, to see if there's something there.

However, I've started to think that this might be a mental thing. Over these past few weeks I've been feeling depressed several times (since May it happened a few times, but at most twice a month, these weeks at least twice a week). I tried to fix my sleep schedule, but I just lie awake with my thoughts at a thousand miles an hour. I kept thinking it would just fix itself, but what if it doesn't?

I think I'm at the point where I might need professional help. However, the way it works here is you have to go to your GP, they can send you through to a mental health professional. But this requires me to go to my GP and talk about all of this. I'm not sure I'm ready to do that: Once I say that, it's *real*, and I don't want it to be.

I've spent way too much typing this out and it might've been one of the hardest things I've done in a long time. I'm pretty sure I need professional help, but as I said, I don't know if I'm ready for it. Does anyone have any advice on how to ""become ready,"" for this.",25Dec2019,1

46,"[NSFW?] This will talk about rape.

Throwaway because mental health concerns are a risk of losing my job.

Hello r/mentalhealth. I know its a longshot but I just want to see if you all can offer me some advice dealing with myself. Im using my phone so sorry if the formatting is poor.

I am a 21 year old male, and have been dealing with large amounts of stress recently and I am in a pretty dark place. I am nervous to go to people for help due to the risk of losing my job and I guess I feel safer using a throwaway on here. I am going to try and tell you all as much as I can without giving too much about me away, and hopefully that doesnt make this hard to understand.

Into the first issue.

When I was 6 I was raped by my teenaged male cousin. Nothing that I know of happened to said cousin, but only my parents, best friend and a therapist know. I did try therapy, but got nothing out of it. I felt better about it by pushing it away and trying to forget it ever happened (unhealthy, I know). It doesnt really affect me too much I dont think, but the fact I had to include it I guess shows it still does.

This whole event really hurt my views on relationships and sex, so I am still a virgin. I have never had a real relationship and it makes me feel like an outsider. I think maybe the whole event stopped me from having a huge sex drive like basically all the other guys ive met growing up and that I know now. I also think it hurt my self esteem, because I never feel “man” enough. Im a straight man, but I feel like im never as good as my friends at talking to women and that im just not ... good enough. I dont really know how to describe it other than I feel like a coward.

Terrible segway into the second issue.

My job requires me to be out to sea for an extended period of time, up to almost a year at a time. All that time doing manual labor, with no days off other than about one weekend a month. I was never supposed to do this job, I guess you could say I got (tricked?) into working here, but im stuck until my contract for this company expires. 

I was supposed to be in the medical field, but got tricked by a supervisor and was forced to change jobs. I was sent to work manual labor in a job section that is disliked by all other work centers for reasons I am unsure of, and the work center I work in is extremely toxic. All I wanted to do was work in the medical field and now I am here, doing something I never imagined myself doing. I am basically wasting my life.

Im terrible at my job. Ive been doing it for about 6 months now, and my stress levels are insane on the boat. I snapped on a senior coworker recently, and really made a fool out of myself and spent the rest of the time contemplating taking off my life vest and jumping overboard. Ive never been subject to suicidal thoughts or actions, and I really caught myself off guard. I hate my job, I hate myself for getting myself in this mess, im on the other side of the country from my friends and family and have no place with these people. I wake up at about 4am every day to go to a job I hate and was never supposed to do, and get yelled at because im terrible at it for 12 hours a day. The only reason im not killing myself is because of my amazing family that I know I will get to see again, and will miss me if I am gone. 

There are resources I can use, but I dont know what could happen to my job if I use them. I dont want to lose this job opportunity because I am very proud to work for this company and later down the road I can hopefully switch back to the medical field like I intended to be in the first place. 

I really dont know what to do. I have no outlets for stress, especially on the boat. Anything helps.

Thank you.",25Dec2019,1
47,"My thoughts on the doomer generation... 

   We don't have a common cause to actually fight for. We need stimulation, we have begun shying away from war, we dont have some massive city to build from scratch. Life isn't exciting anymore.
The only issue now is global warming and perhaps our simple idea of just recycling to help isn't clear enough. I'm talking about getting down in the dirt and using our strength for preserving life, by planting trees or helping construct a sustainable building project, etc. Our vision once was wide and obtuse, now it is narrow and acute. It is in my contrarian view, our need to go through the shit and hardships; on behalf of a righteous cause, to see the self actualized image of yourself. 

Basically... just go and ""fight"" for something you believe to be righteous! But be a good person. For the rest of us pl0x.

This story is about my friend who I'm very worried about and I don't know how to help him. 

So my friend, let's call him Conner, he's depressed. He has been depressed on and off for about 3 years and he has hurt himself several times throughout these past few years. But it's been getting worse. He's been hurting himself a lot more in the past few months and I'm really concerned for him.

This is for some context, sorry for any confusion. We're in highschool btw. Conner and I became friends in May if this year. So not that long right? Yeah, but we've clicked so well that we have become almost inseparable and we like each other so bonus feelings! Yay... Anyways, because we're so close, I was able to get him to promise me that he'll try not to hurt himself and if he does, to tell me. Now that this is over, I can explain what's been going on.

Conner has been hurting himself in small amounts in the past 3-4 months, mostly by punching his wall. I tell him not to, he still does it. But the wall punching has turned into actual cutting and bleeding. He tells me when he does, and when he tells me, I force him to wait until it heals up to do it again. But it's been getting worse. 

Conner has had really bad things happen to him when he was young, causing him to do more bad things. He realized what he did and beats himself up for it. Mixed with the fact that he has very few friends and doesn't really do much in his free time. This has caused him to be a bit obsessive and he tells me I'm the thing that makes him the happiest. Now, I've been on a trip for about a week and during this time, we have been talking almost constantly, but 2 nights ago,he hurt himself more than he has before from what I know. I was asleep when this happened, and because I was asleep, he didn't have anyone to talk to. He was feeling extremely shitty that night and while in the shower, he was depressed because I wasn't there to comfort him. So, he punched himself. In the face. When I heard about this, I went on full panic mode. I was crying and freaking out and texting him but he hadn't waken up yet. When he did, I was so relieved but also terrified. We talked about it a bit but I'm still scared he might do it again.

I am so so sorry for any confusion and miss understandings. If you have questions or want things cleared up, ask in the comments. But I don't know what to do if he does it again and I want to help him but don't know how. Please, please, please tell me of anything that I can do to help him.",25Dec2019,1

So a couple of months ago she texted us about how she felt for the first time and told us that she’s depressed. Went on to say she can’t feel happy etc. We supported her by listening and I would admit that this was maybe the wrong thing to do but we just wanted to help at the time, and we tried to ask her if she wanted help and told her the options available. 

Over the next couple of months she would have random occurrences were she would text us about how she was feeling and again we would try to tell her it’s ok to be ill and the options available, however she’s adamant about wanting to heal herself. In person, she’s quite extroverted and cheerful and constantly wants to go out rather than isolating herself but only discloses her true feelings by text and phone call. 

Flash forward to now, she’s recently said that she feels like killing herself, and from support hotlines I know the best thing to do is to be there to listen and support her, however now she’s also saying that maybe she’s not depressed and she just can’t handle stress, etc. I’ve been there to listen to her when she’s feeling down but I feel helpless, I don’t want to lose my friend but I don’t know how to help her without pushing her away.

55,"I was once a huge advocate for “therapy is great a professional can help you”  like if someone had a problem I would push the whole see a professional thing

After my experiences and “seeing it out” I’ve learned it doesn’t apply to everything / not all therapists are great 

Fair warning this post talks about anxiety and not necessarily abusive but definitely a shitty parent 

I had severe anxiety related to my part time barista job, I couldn’t eat, sleep, or even think at times because the thought of going there worried me so much, I thought maybe it was just because I was new but with time it only grew worse.
I expressed this to my mother repeatedly and told her I wanted to quit, crying and begging at times, after months of this and her refusal and the occasional “you’re an ungrateful bitch I had it worse” she gave me a choice “I can’t deal with you anymore do you want to go to headspace or the adolescent mental health service” I chose the latter, where my mum worked in the same building - I thought that would be great because the therapist would know my mother is a crazy bitch but I was wrong.
The first session rolls around and I am desperate to try and talk about everything happening, I talk to the therapist for twenty minutes, mum talks to her in another room for forty.
From that session onwards the routine was intended to go as follows; get asked how I am, and then be made to listen about what anxiety is and do worksheets.
The third or fourth session was consisted of one worksheet with columns along the lines of issue-how you feel-how it’s not that bad-what can you do about it.
Immediately she went for the kill - how my anxiety about work was completely unwarranted and everything was fine you’re stressing for no reason just breathe. “Exposure therapy” doesn’t work if you leave your problem that is obviously causing a great deal of issues that can be avoided.
I got pissed off, I hadn’t actually gotten to talk at all about what was hurting me and this woman wasn’t listening and was shoving words down my throat, just like my mother who would tell me to fake a smile after crying in the car before every shift, I so desperately wanted to have someone listen to me.
I left that session angry and in tears half an hour early, because I wasn’t being compliant, the therapist decided to cut our sessions in half, I continued going for more sessions , nothing changed except for the amount of worksheets sitting in my room, I expressed how I was done and I was quitting my job, she seemed disappointed but I didn’t care.
The next week I quit and immediately felt the most relief all at once in my life.
A week later my mother found out from a friend of hers who I shouldn’t have trusted with the information of my job status.
Shit hit the fan, I was grounded for the rest of the year and was generally just getting treated like garbage by my mother. The thing that hurts is that I never went out bar maybe two times a year because she was so strict and I stopped trying when I started grade seven, it sent me spiraling into a depressive state for weeks, therapy was canceled five weeks consecutively, when I got back I told her everything that happened and she didn’t even comment, just saying that next session I would be discharged 
For the rest of the working year my sessions were canceled.
I have to go back there next year to talk about strategies she gave me to make a mental health plan despite her being of no help to me, all I did in that time period was quit my job, get really cold/distant/done with my mother/her bullshit, and get really into Queen’s music because it’s all I have to express my anger towards my shitty mother who is great at pretending to be a good parent.

So yeah I didn’t have a good experience at all and my anxiety is only better because it’s been replaced with a feeling of just being so done with my life’s bullshit, I hope I didn’t sound like an entitled brat but I just didn’t get what I needed from therapy and had an altogether low key traumatic experience with being trapped in a room with someone who wasn’t on my side and reinforced my problems rather than helping me",25Dec2019,1

My family hasn’t been any help with anything and it doesn’t help that I’m always afraid to go to them. I try to mention it to them but it’s like they don’t get it. Currently there’s a huge fight going on with my parents (absolute screaming fight) and I’m terrified to even leave my room. I feel like it’s been one after another lately and I’m just... mentally I feel like I’m done. Whenever I go to my family for help, they give some advice but it’s a quick 5 minute discussion and the next topic is brought up. 
The only Person who would help me and understand is my bf..and idk if we’re together at this point. I can’t reach out because we’re even having our own problems and I’m just afraid of something happening where we fall into that cycle again and we argue. And the harder part is is is that we aren’t seeing each other for the holiday and it’s absolutely killing me.. so much so to the point where I had a panic attack and am laying with a picture of us (it was the only thing to calm me down, actually seeing him).All I want to do is talk, vent, and be with him and I’ll just know things will be okay. He would make all of this okay and a little better for me..

It sucks feeling and knowing I can’t go to my family or anyone with anything without the feeling of being yelled at or having something come about where the situation gets worse. 

I don’t know if this even was the correct subreddit to vent and discuss, but I appreciate whoever is reading this...

Merry Christmas everyone.",25Dec2019,1

There's a girl I've been seeing, and she's not doing well. Things were great at first... it started out very casual, just fucking, but we were both on the same page about being very into each other and interested to see where things went. And went they did. And then out of nowhere it was like she started putting up a wall overnight.  
Glossing over the in-between, she's just really not in a good place right now. She was in the military and some of the things she experienced haunt her... doesn't sleep well at all, says she hasn't felt like herself in a long time, etc. I knew about it but didn't know the severity of it until recently.  
The thing is... it's one of my favorite things about her. Not that she's suffering or anything like that, just... her experiences make her relatable, and that's HUGE for me. It isn't something that's easy to find at all.  
I served too, and the things I did... well, I was in a front-line role and went on multiple deployments to some very dark corners of the world at the height of the conflicts there. Finding a partner I can connect with on THAT level is damn near impossible. I mean I was married for 7 fucking years and we NEVER came anywhere close to these subjects or the level of openness I have with her. I could never be open about anything with the ex... which maybe contributed to the failure of that relationship a bit, but that's a topic for another day.  
But I think I fucked up. The first time we spent the night together we lightly touched on the subject, and she'd asked me about my stuff. And I told her that the normal stuff, the death and violence and shit that keeps most people up at night doesn't get to me. Maybe my wires are crossed, maybe it's the TBI, maybe I was just desensitized to it, but I'm good with all that and I'm good with the things we did over there. And I think maybe that made her think that I didn't/couldn't understand her stuff. And that just isn't true. I wasn't lying about that, but I was deflecting... there's other aspects that do stay with me.  
The really fucked thing is that I feel like I'm able to be more open with her about this stuff than anybody else in my life. Even my best friend, who was right there through a lot of that shit... we acknowledge it and know the other ""gets it"" but it's never explicitly discussed between us.  
So now, a few days ago, she's decided she needs a change of scenery. Fresh place with fresh people to help her find her center again. She's quitting her job this week and going to stay with family in another state. Doesn't know when or if she'll be back. And I feel like if I could just explain to her that I DO get it, maybe she'd feel like she doesn't need to leave. But in doing so, in thinking of how to broach that subject and say my piece, I've been forced to confront the demons I thought I'd long since buried. Well... I HAD buried them, but it seems that doesn't really kill them. Dig them up and there they are again. The loss. The meaninglessness of it all. Feeling like nothing in life really fucking matters. Some of the shit I've seen, or done, or caused... it's hard to feel like there's any meaning or purpose to anything when you know you can be wiped off the face of the planet in the blink of an eye and your loved ones will move on and history sure as fuck won't remember you. In general I tend to focus that perspective into an attitide of ""nothing matters so you may as well choose to be happy and enjoy the present"" but... I'm finding it difficult to remember how to do that.  
And now here I am, having unburied all this shit, about to lose the only person I've felt a real emotional connection with in my entire adult life. I haven't felt ANYTHING in a very, very long time until her, and so I don't really know how to cope with the emotions.  

Those demons are making me feel stagnant, and that makes me feel restless. I have a good career, 2 great kids with the ex, a nice house, fun toys, etc.... and I want nothing to do with any of it. It's the same bullshit every fucking day and I'm sick of it. The house and toys are just things, sell them and give the cash to the ex for the kids. And the kids... they'll be fine. They have a lot of positive influences in their lives. I'm not as involved with them as I maybe should be anyway. Part of me wants to chase down a (private military) contracting gig and go off to another dark corner where life is simple and straightforward. I have contacts all over the African continent, middle east, southeast Asia, etc... all it'd really take is a phone call and I could be gone in a week or two. And then, being entirely honest, part of me wants to hop on one of my bikes and ride up to my favorite mountain road... there's a long straight stretch between sections of tight corners where I can get close to 200mph if I pin it... and maybe just not make the turn at the end.  


I was hoping writing all this shit out would help me find a bit of clarity and make shit a little less jumbled in my head. I don't think it did.",25Dec2019,1
58,"Hi all, not sure what I'm struggling with. Since I flunked out of college 2 years ago I've had mostly depression symptoms (feeling empty/a failure/guilt, mood swings/agitated easily, constant fatigue, and severe inability to concentrate, think clearly and make decisions). I've only worked dead end jobs since and recently lost my current job which I have not taken well (felt like a failure, ect.). I haven't been seriously considered suicide since a brief time in high school so I don't think it's a danger. 

&amp;#x200B;

However my marriage is good, she's easily the best thing that's happened to me. I never thought about my mental health until it started effecting her moods which I don't like. I also feel horrible that my professional failure is detrimental to her and our future kids.  The odd thing is the symptoms I mentioned don't happen all the time and I don't feel in control of them as if I will be feeling neutral and something will remind me of failing school/lack of career and I feel ""depressed"" the rest of the day. I also struggle severely with being upset about my mistakes both big (remembering failing school) and small (leaving my coffee mug at home) and they send me into the same ""depressed"" state.

59,"Hey all, It’s come to my attention that I’m not well mentally. I just wanted to know from perhaps someone who is diagnosed, how it is or what it’s like to be bipolar. For a very long time I’ve repressed memories from having an abusive and drug addicted brother and I thought that if I just tried to put things out of my head and accept it it would turn out fine. And for a while it did, and I wouldn’t change those things about my past. Now however, I’m experiencing a lot of emotional outbursts, mood swings, very very low libido, and I’ve gone back to harming myself. I feel like I’m in a constant panic and I feel like nothing in my life is right. I’ve become manipulative and during the times when I get truly frustrated and angry I will do things, but later remember the situation going differently. I bring up bipolar just because my mother has been diagnosed for a very long time. My brother was diagnosed when he was in his mid teens, and is now diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. I don’t know what to do, but I hardly have time to go to a doctor. I absolutely hate the person I feel that I am becoming. If anyone has any advice from coping mechanisms to if I can go to my regular doctor or if I need to see a therapist it would be greatly appreciated. Please help me.",25Dec2019,1
60," It all feels so meaningless. I will be forgotten. Maybe I’ll become famous among men and my legacy will live on until the end of man, then some aliens will discover me, and so on, but still, in the end, the universe dies due to entropy and there’s nothing you can do to stop that. There’s an idea that we have a “soul.” I don’t believe that. I believe what “we” are is about 7 pounds of flesh contained in a skull. Very complex flesh, though, but still, all the emotions and everything makes us “us” is just the manifestation of chemicals and structures in the brain, which were formed due to our environment (which includes genetics the way I think of that). I don’t believe in free will. Try to understand the mechanism behind it and you can’t, is it rational, random, logical, combination of those, etc. When you make a decision you might deliberate, thinking of the pros and cons, and come to rational decision based on that. Or maybe, you “choose” to pick without reasoning. Okay, so you made a choice, but did you really. At that point it was random, or it was because that’s just how the chemicals and structures in your brain acted. Not free will. I think man has a hard time not only understanding but also accepting the idea that we are not metaphysical, that we do not transcend our physical bodies. The idea that our thoughts and emotions are just the result of reactions in the brain seems so wrong to most people, but people can’t say why other than “it feels like it’s more than that”. Due to that, I don’t see the meaning in anything and I’m stuck with this nihilistic dread. I wish I wasn't so nihilistic but I keep going with this kind of thinking and I can't escape it.",25Dec2019,1

[C] But, I’m a college student and I currently don’t have a job due to seasonal hiring (I need more of a permanence job). So obviously it’d be quite stupid of me to go and get pregnant especially from someone I am not with (I am single). 

[C] I have a therapist and she completely disregards this topic even though it’s very important to me. It’s gotten so bad that I sometimes stay up and cry about not having my children here with me. 

[C] So lately, I’ve been pretending that I have children. No, I don’t go and tell people I’m pregnant. I don’t write on medical forms that I have children. I am completely responding in the most realistic and accurate way. 

[C] I know this will get a lot of criticism but I believe this personally helps me with my baby fever and not actually going out and getting pregnant by a stranger. I even considered buying a reborn baby or toddler but they are quite expensive. 

[C] I even received a kitten as a late Mother’s Day gift/early Graduation gift to help deal with my baby fever. I take care of him and love him so much.

62,"I am not sure where to find an answer to this question, so I hope this is the right place. I am introverted and have social anxiety but I am pretty chill with all of my friends. We hang out several times a week and enjoy each others’ company. However, when I move (or travel for a long time) somewhere, or they do, it’s as if the friendship is temporarily over. I cannot find the motivation to text them. I feel like I just don’t care. I can go several months without so much as a “hey, what’s up” to my closest friends. When I go back, we are best friends again and are together all the time. 

This is also how I lost touch with many of my high school friends. We went separate ways and we’d talk periodically at first but once I met new people, it’s as if those friends stopped existing for me. I’ve recently briefly reconnected with a HS friend. He said “bro, let’s not disappear to each other again”. You can guess what happened after that conversation. I’ve never ghosted anyone, so I know that it most definitely goes both ways (they don’t text me either).

My question is, is this social anxiety? If not, what is it? Is it normal? How can I fix it? I do not want to be like this, because I build meaningful relationships only to abandon them when one of us goes a different way.",25Dec2019,1
63,"I post this in r/mentalhealth because I'm bipolar type 2. Plus if I post it anywhere else I'll probably just get crazy bitch replies without anyone reading this properly.

I've had two exes that I had long term relationships with. Both started up as hook up's then turned into relationships, wasn't really a friendship thing that started us off. 

After I broke it off with the first one he got with his now wife and had kids to her, second one my young kids are to and now his with someone who's got younger kids then ours and seems like a definite life partner. I left for the right reasons and it seems from reading so far that I'm in regret. But I'm not. What I'm trying to work out is.. am I that extreme ex that puts someone through so much bullshit that they come out a better person knowing exactly what they do and don't want? That they know how to treat a women properly because I grilled them so badly during our relationship.

Before each of these partners got with me they didnt really have a long term relationship saying their relationships always screw up and mainly for the same reasons. Guy I had kids to was living at his grans playing videogames without a lisence at 22 years old. Never held a proper job. Got locked out of school in year 8. L But when we got together I pushed him to get his lisence and get a job. 

I'm very jealous when it comes to relationships aswell so if something didn't fly well with me they'd definantly know about it. And id explain in every single detail how it upset me. They'd openly express how hot they'd think someone was to me, or if a girl would flirt with them and they did it back id be really pissed off. 

I'd like to think I made them a better person.. but I also realise that I was a cunt at the end of the day. Even if I was the one who left, I was still a massive headache. And then my parents on top of that were hell to deal with. 

So here I am chillin.. feeling empty when I get reminders of how well they're treating another girl, when they were never like that with me. Neither of them were affectionate in public with me.. neither showed me any sort've appreciation of being with me when I was full of compliments for them and would beam when I spoke about them. 

This is all come about today because kids father was telling me today how he dressed up to impress partners family at an outting recently. When he couldn't be bothered making an appearance for anything to do with my family, and when ever my parents offered to help me and him out he'd basically get annoyed. 

I left for the right reasons, I've got no sexual attraction to either of them now. I just feel like I manned these guys up and didn't get the reward out of it. That probably comes across really badly but I don't know how else to word it.",25Dec2019,1

 \- Does it mean that I may have some kind of mental illness?

One night I found out after lying to me about seeing her and calling her psycho saying he is done with her, I found out they slept together and he told her about me cutting myself. I then found out she had stole my phone and smashed it.

It was the most disrespected and pain ever imaginable and I snapped. I ended up destroying his car and keying it and it was so much damage that it was totaled. It was really psycho of me and I regret it every day because it makes me look horrible. I’m scared it is going to follow me forever and I will forever be judged.

67,"I’m 17, and I’d say that I realized I was depressed around 3 years ago. However, up to this day, I still feel uncomfortable with saying that I have depression. The thing is, I know I want to die. I know that I want to kill myself. I know that I don’t have any hopes for myself nor do I look forward to the future. I know that nothing keeps me going anymore. But even with all this, I’ve never actually self-harmed. I guess it’s good that I don’t do it (mostly because I don’t want my family to know), but because I’ve never harmed myself, it kinda feels wrong to call myself depressed? And yeah, this is a complete self-diagnosis. Again, my family doesn’t know as I really don’t want to burden them about this, and therapy is expensive as hell in the Philippines. I’ve tried talking to my guidance counsellor, and he said that as much as he would like to help me, therapy is really the only way to go. I stopped going to him though as he said that my parents would have to know if I wanted to try it out, as I’m still a minor.

The only reason I can willingly say that I’m depressed is because of fucking memory loss. I have a friend that is clinically diagnosed, and even he said that he forgets about a lot of things due to depression. I’ve also seen a lot of threads on Twitter where people shared having the same experience as they are depressed. So yeah, I essentially remember nothing from earlier this morning, to whole weeks and months. The few events I remember, I associate to specific school years.

But really, I knew I was depressed during Christmas in 2016. We were on our way to Church, and I honest to god started crying because I just didn’t want to be there anymore. I cried, thinking about how everyone else was happy while I was stuck in a cycle of self-hatred and complete despair. I cried because I truly realized that life just wasn’t worth living another damn year.

She is so happy and the people around her love her so much, but I can't help but feel bittersweet about it. I can't help but wonder 'for how long? ' and 'why are her parents so naive?'. I had a really hard time in school, in hindsight I'm pretty sure I was depressed for a long time, and I don't feel like my parents could have done much. It feels awful to know that in two to three years they will give her up to that horrible place too. I think in my mind there are only two types of kids, the bullies (who enjoy school but are terrible people) and the bullied (who are good people but miserable). I know that isn't rational but it is how I've felt for a long time and because I think she is a good kid I feel like she'll be miserable too. 
I also worry how I will feel if that isn't the case. Hopefully it would challenge that false dichotomy but what if I end up labeling her as a bully, or resenting her for being good but not having to suffer for it like I did? I think the idea that only bad people are happy in school makes what happened to me feel fair somehow, and if it's proven wrong I would really have to deal with the unfairness.

I am leaning towards either skitsphrena but I’m not sure but I’m going to go ahead and tell you all why

To start I’m going tell you what I’m already dignoised with by a professional: PTSD,Depresion,anxitiy

Alright so everything started when I was in 4th grade. I was a pretty normal kid up until than till the world just became different... like it was me against them. My mother has bi polar and has almost killed me a few times and while living with her I had no electricity water food heat or ac. So I was living like a 3rd world country. I was seeing and hearing things than but it wasn’t that bad so I thought I was just worried with anxitity. Than about 6th grade everything went to utter shit. I was locked down in a room for that whole year with 4 other students and I didn’t talk anyone and my mind just left my body. It’s like I made a new world for myself and I lived in a scary movie. I started seeing things (I’ll tell you what later) and hearing footsteps I wouldn’t shower for days out of fear that they would get me when I did. I thought my brother was a clone switching body’s every time I didn’t see him and that lead to me giving him a test every time I saw him. I was not me I was gone and detached from the world I was once in and it was 24/7 all day and I would often while having this get very excited and start pacing and freaking out screaming yelling or I would do the complete opposite and just not move a muscle out of fear. 

  Fast forward to this year I’m in 9th grade as a freshman and things are a lot better but I still see things and hear things and I’ll rarly thing my brother is a clone but that usually goes away rather soon and isn’t constant I always and parinoid and feeling like I’m being followed though.

I would like to get advice about my mental state. I’m going to see a therapist but I would like to get feedback from the community as well. I’m an athletic male, 30 yo.

95% of the time I’m performing very high. My typical day consists of waking up after ~7.5h of sleep, 20 min of morning exercises, doing a lil bit of home labor, then going to my management work for 8h full of quick and important decisions, next 2h on the gym (weightlifting) every other day, then going back home and doing stuff like cooking, shopping, cleaning etc, and then going back to sleep. I’m busy all the time and feel motivated and energetic. On the weekends I also tend to have a day full of activities - visiting family and friends, visiting museums, I’m rarely able to play on my console. I feel like I never stop and I enjoy this. I feel very self confident and I try to improve myself as much as possible - I’m focused on the target and on the future. I’m also very sociable and outgoing.

There are few things that worry me:

Sometimes I realize that when I have a moment I could spend resting I tend to think up additional activities I can do instead. After some consideration these actions may not look necessary to do at this moment and resting will probably be a better idea, but I can’t resist and I do them. It happens all the time, a few times a day.

Next thing is that I need to check things multiple times. Do I have my keys, wallet, phone and gloves? Let’s pat my pockets ten times in a row. Have I closed the window, turned off the oven and turned off the tap? Let’s do ten laps around the house. I do this despite the fact that I remember that I checked these, and if I don’t I will keep worrying about it. It also happens all the time, a few times a day.

Other thing is that sometimes a random event that pushes me out of balance happens. Usually these are really trivial encounters like MAYBE running a red light in a car when nobody sees it - despite the fact that even if I got caught and needed to pay the fine, it won’t be much for me. After that I’m overthinking, feeling down, sleepy and nauseous, having no motivation and energy. My sociability and self confidence disappears. It happens even though I objectively know that this event is trivial and I should not be worried about it. Other situations like this are worrying that some important person misunderstood me and took my words as rude - even though I made sure that he or she didn’t, etc. That’s this 5% of overall time of my life. After about one week of feeling down everything goes back to my baseline - performing high and feeling great. This happens one time a few months, something about 3-4 months.

Moreover, sometimes the day after drinking I immediately feel like I described in the paragraph above and it also lasts about one week. That’s why I’m drinking less and less, but it seems like the amount of alcohol necessary to provoke this state diminishes with every year of my life. For now the amount that will cause this are six 4cl shots or 4 big beers. In my country it counts as “almost not drinking“. I drink only on the social events, maybe one time a month. This also happens one time a few months, something about 3-4 months. It has become a factor that has a serious influence on my wellbeing and I decided to quit drinking totally.


Does this set of conditions have a name? What can I do to improve my life? As I mentioned above, I'm going to go to the therapy, but should I go to some special type of it? What should I do?",25Dec2019,1
84,Growing up in a Muslim household was just depressing and confusing. I couldn't and still can't wrap the idea of God around my head. I tried to pretend but that led to me keeping myself to myself and being even more depressed and my parents hating me even more. I got tired of keeping the act up and told them how I felt a few months ago. Now I'm in uni with no support from them and my student loan hardly covers for my accommodation. I don't know what I'll do next year since they said they won't be my guarantee for the loan. Merry Christmas everyone.,25Dec2019,1
85,"I wasn't sure where to post this, but it's been bugging me, so I feel like asking a hivemind might help. 

I've recently started being mean, and it is very much out of character. By this I mean, I will impulsively just say rude things, potentially confrontational things, or simply try to get people mad at me. Telling people I dont like them, when I really dont mean it and have no reason to want to hurt their feelings. 
I've only done it a few times that I'm aware of, but I feel awful about it afterward and cannot make any sense of why I did it. I've never been like that before and have always just been naturally nice to everyone unless they were mean to me or a friend first.

So it seems like it may be a manifestation of some internal issue or a psychological distress, and I guess I'm just trying to see if anyone else has experienced anything similar. 
I do have a PTSD diagnosis, but that's it as far as official mental health troubles, but it does come with a lot of serious behavioral and emotional problems. I'm overall very happy and have been steadily making life progress, health progress, and building and maintaining meaningful relationships since the first time I noticed it. However, this is the first time in my life that I have been consistently safe, happy, and comfortable. So maybe it's a mechanism to force conflict, because that's what I'm used to.

Or am I honestly just turning mean? Does that happen?",25Dec2019,1

91,"Hi there,

I was seeing a therapist for five years, but she recently retired.  It was purely for my anxiety and emotional issues, and she really helped me through that, but given how great my luck has been, just as she retired, I began developing other issues.  Or really, older issues began surfacing back.  Massive and chaotic mood swings, and intrusive thoughts, now surrounding largely suicide.  My panic attacks have even come back despite still using the cognitive techniques she taught me.  And my life hasn't gotten worse in any objective sense, if anything it's gotten better.

The fact I have been hospitalized before (I have a thread about it made earlier), and the fact that I have seriously considered committing suicide recently, and I have intrusive thoughts causing it, if I admit this to a new therapist (my old therapist has referred me to another one), what exactly is going to happen?  If I get locked away in a mental hospital, that's basically a jail sentence and I'd lose my job and then I might as well be dead.  So should I just not admit these things, but if I don't, then I don't see how i can get help.",25Dec2019,1

I won't be happy with this life so I've given up on my own identity, goals, job wishes, sexuality, everything. I decided to not come out to my family, to not have relationships, to withdraw and just work. I've tried therapy but it makes everything more complicated. They are so happy.

93,"About a week ago I finished my last appointment of my ""Assessment Period"" as they put it. I have spent 3 months going to see a psychologist and various other staff at the Mental Health Clinic in my city. I originally got referred there by my Doctor who had a suspicion I had Bi Polar (due to various life events and my family history).

We wen't through the assessment process and did various activities such as the symptom cards, a time map and some one on one discussion. Throughout I had my ups and downs with moods etc and various symptoms coming and going. I was always hoping for the best and there was hints from my psychologist to what I may have. They started for looking for Bi Polar then around half way through focused more on BPD. I was always hoping the answer would be no I don't have anything and I am fine. As I went into the last appointment, the psychologist sat me down. Talked me through everything she said to me I have displayed all the symptoms for BPD, I was confused at her long explanation eventually asking does that mean I have BPD? She said yes, 100% sure. She also said in terms of Bi Polar she has a very very high suspicion I have it and alot of the symptoms I have shown are very in-line with Bi Polar. She mentioned that although she has a high suspicion that I both Bi Polar and BPD, she can only diagnose me with BPD for now until they witness me in a Manic state then she said they can diagnose Bi Polar also.  


I have no idea how to deal with this. Ever since that last appointment I have not been the same. Any Advice?",25Dec2019,1

Since im about 12 years old (20 now), im super into games. And ive always tried to become ""the best"", but never really made it all to the top. I play about 1 - 3 hours on a working day, and about 5 - 8 hours on weekends/holidays. And now comes to problem: Even if i play for hours a day, it often is not fun at all for me.

98,"Problems dealing with trauma and stress

[NSFW?] This will talk about rape.

Throwaway because mental health concerns are a risk of losing my job.

Hello r/mentalhealth. I know its a longshot but I just want to see if you all can offer me some advice dealing with myself. Im using my phone so sorry if the formatting is poor.

I am a 21 year old male, and have been dealing with large amounts of stress recently and I am in a pretty dark place. I am nervous to go to people for help due to the risk of losing my job and I guess I feel safer using a throwaway on here. I am going to try and tell you all as much as I can without giving too much about me away, and hopefully that doesnt make this hard to understand.

Into the first issue.

When I was 6 I was raped by my teenaged male cousin. Nothing that I know of happened to said cousin, but only my parents, best friend and a therapist know. I did try therapy, but got nothing out of it. I felt better about it by pushing it away and trying to forget it ever happened (unhealthy, I know). It doesnt really affect me too much I dont think, but the fact I had to include it I guess shows it still does.

This whole event really hurt my views on relationships and sex, so I am still a virgin. I have never had a real relationship and it makes me feel like an outsider. I think maybe the whole event stopped me from having a huge sex drive like basically all the other guys ive met growing up and that I know now. I also think it hurt my self esteem, because I never feel “man” enough. Im a straight man, but I feel like im never as good as my friends at talking to women and that im just not ... good enough. I dont really know how to describe it other than I feel like a coward.

Terrible segway into the second issue.

My job requires me to be out to sea for an extended period of time, up to almost a year at a time. All that time doing manual labor, with no days off other than about one weekend a month. I was never supposed to do this job, I guess you could say I got (tricked?) into working here, but im stuck until my contract for this company expires. 

I was supposed to be in the medical field, but got tricked by a supervisor and was forced to change jobs. I was sent to work manual labor in a job section that is disliked by all other work centers for reasons I am unsure of, and the work center I work in is extremely toxic. All I wanted to do was work in the medical field and now I am here, doing something I never imagined myself doing. I am basically wasting my life.

Im terrible at my job. Ive been doing it for about 6 months now, and my stress levels are insane on the boat. I snapped on a senior coworker recently, and really made a fool out of myself and spent the rest of the time contemplating taking off my life vest and jumping overboard. Ive never been subject to suicidal thoughts or actions, and I really caught myself off guard. I hate my job, I hate myself for getting myself in this mess, im on the other side of the country from my friends and family and have no place with these people. I wake up at about 4am every day to go to a job I hate and was never supposed to do, and get yelled at because im terrible at it for 12 hours a day. The only reason im not killing myself is because of my amazing family that I know I will get to see again, and will miss me if I am gone. 

There are resources I can use, but I dont know what could happen to my job if I use them. I dont want to lose this job opportunity because I am very proud to work for this company and later down the road I can hopefully switch back to the medical field like I intended to be in the first place. 

I really dont know what to do. I have no outlets for stress, especially on the boat. Anything helps.

Thank you.",25Dec2019,1

102,"First of all, English is not my first language, so excuse me if I commit any mistakes.

I dont really know where to start. 

Ive felt different from other people my whole life, and other people have told me that I am ""peculiar"" a few times.
I am too sensitive. Loud noises, crowds, bright colors, squishy food... Those are things that have always bothered me.

I was diagnosed with social anxiety and general anxiety disorder when I was a child, and I left school as a teenager because I couldn't stand being in a classroom with so much stimulus all the time (after that I was home schooled)
Ive always felt like I didn't belong, although I had and still have friends. But most of the time I think I was just masking to fit in.

All this makes me think I could be an autistic person, but Ive never been diagnosed and no one ever told me that I could be one (Ive visited many psychologists and psychiatrists during my life, but Ive only been diagnosed with anxiety and depression)

The idea of being in the spectrum makes me feel at easy and in peace with myself, but I dont want to self diagnose. There are traits that I don't share with other autistic people:
I started speaking and reading quite early, I understand sarcasm and use it ALL the time, I dont find it difficult to understand what other person is feeling or thinking...

Long as hell post. In summary, I just want to know if I am an autistic woman or I'm just overanalyzing myself

In the past few months I gained a bunch of weight, and didn't take much care of myself. In the past few weeks I've been feeling mentally exhausted, down and not been doing much all together- except my job. I've also had relationship problems at home so that didn't help for sure.

I own a company and late hours are a standard, but what confuses me is that I haven't really worked the long hours I'm used to lately. But still, I'm constantly tired. Not physically, mentally.

I'm constantly overwhelmed, in a fog and can't even wash my hair regularly. Which is weird because it's completely out of character for me. At work I'm doing my best and being the usual energized self.

109,"I was searching some advice on Google on what to do when you’re feeling lonely and bored and I came across this magnificent response on Quora written by “Augie Gardner.” It is one of the most beautiful responses I have ever read. It is poetic, meaningful, and touching. It made me feel very positive and gave me some motivation I clearly needed. I wanted to share this with everyone on Reddit, because I think the author did an amazing job and I don’t want this to get lost in the shadows of the internet. I hope all of you find this just as hopeful as I did.

Tl;dr: I found some really well-written advice on Quora about how to overcome depression and loneliness. Written by Augie Gardner:


“You think often about the complexity of life. The abstract implications and ranges of defining success, and the vanity of those that consider themselves so proud. You are haunted by the smiles on the faces of those that have it all, and the smiles on the faces of those who have so little. You understand the inherently hypocritical nature of human judgement; the subconscious nuances that seem to ooze from ""happy"" people. You hate them... You want to be them.

(Edit: since some have asked, the original question provided more thorough question details which have since been removed by Quora, but I reference those details in this answer, still.)

Your depression is less of a submersion - not an underwater suffocation - but more of a compression; a bout between you and the atmospheric pressure of social delusions and the disheartening reality of a past that neither comforts nor impresses you. Is this what life is about?

The gravity of time seems to get the better of you. The resentful recession into unemployment. The holistic recognition of wasted time, and the repetitive burn each night you rest without progression to be proud of.
You live in a country that affords the average person every reasonable opportunity to live a fulfilling life, yet you remain devoid of the spark that some of your peers are so gifted to show. You're used to it. Surrounded by conversations of personal growth and bland careers that the average person salivates just thinking about. Why?

Yet... You are valuable.
You are as valuable as ever. Contemplating such a destructive question with all relative understanding of the potential futures laid before you. You are fragile. But in your fragility you have incredible opportunity. A mind to hold itself accountable, and a canvas so distorted that Picasso might call you competition.

Yes... You are valuable.
You have no family, no friends, no girlfriend. You find these to be weaknesses. They are strengths. You have such opportunity to create a version of yourself the world has never seen, and you know this. You focus on the negatives because that is your rewards system. You consider it a losing battle and so you find comfort in holding the world accountable for a future that is ultimately your responsibility; your choice.
Your value is intrinsic, but even as I glorify you, you question it. Your resume does not drip with seniority. You hold less self-respect than you should. And your past produces a future where each day is almost indistinguishable from the day before. It is a cycle. A comfort.
Change It.

It is a GOOD thing you have no girlfriend. DON'T get one. You don't love yourself, and no one else's love is going to fill that void in a way that breaks what appears to be a cyclic devaluation of self.
Pick up a hobby. Not just any hobby. A difficult one. One that you can put on your resume. Practice it. Continue practicing it. Change the way you look at yourself by acquiring skills that you can speak about with confidence. You lack passion. Don't fill this with women. Fill this with skills. This may seem pompous and trivial, but it is not. It is therapy.

Practice overcoming difficulties, any difficulties, strange difficulties. Run farther than you ever have before. Vomit afterwards. Do a handstand. Fall over. Do it again. Learn how to write loops in Javascript. Learn how to shuffle a deck of cards with one hand. Learn to ice skate. Learn to hit a speed-bag with perfect rhythm. Learn to sew. Learn to solder circuitboards. Learn to cook. Little things. Impressive things. Strange things. All day. Remove TV from your life and commit yourself to productivity.

You're stuck in a spiral. Depression doesn't fix itself if we commit ourselves to focusing on what we lack. To break the cycle, commit yourself to progress by asking yourself what good each activity brings you throughout the day. If it is not explicitly valuable, remove it. No friends? Great. Now is a perfect time to selfishly mold yourself into someone you'd be intrigued to meet.

Every action you take becomes more and more a part of your character. The triumphs and the trials... We learn an exponentially greater deal about ourselves in times of distress. This is not your epilogue, this is your prelude. Your training day. You are 28. You have two arms and two legs, a mind full of aspiration and a past that doesn't quite align with who you wish you were. Start today. Do what I've suggested. Fall asleep in proud progression and wake with every responsible passion to continue the process. Change your focus, smile without hesitation, and begin to love yourself the way your future you is begging for.

I wish you all the best.

❤️ Augie”

All I've ever wanted to do was to be in the military, to get away from home and be my own person. Being in has been some of the best moments of my life I excel at my job, and love my unit. However, I tore 3 ligaments in my knee during training and since then I've basically been immobile. That means I can't attend schools, or take a PT test for the foreseeable year or so. Since then I went from soldier who was considered to be great to someone who is a dead weight. I can't do anything but sit and wait to heal. It doesn't matter how much I pour my heart and soul into work because I'll always be seen as someone who can't PT and someone who in terms of statistics is lacking. It doesn't matter how ""technically proficient"" I am. "" It doesn't matter how good you are at your jobs if you can't take your PT test or shoot.""   


Since then, I feel lost. No work I do has meaning anymore. I feel so utterly helpless that I can't help but get angry at myself. I have to sit and wait, and recover. I am so far behind my peers at this point I'd have to play catch up the rest of my career. Little things irritate me so much more than they have in the past. I monotonously clean my room over and over to the point that the tile is stripped, I constantly think about hurting people when they talk to me for no reason for at all. It feels like I'm always in a high stress situation when I'm doing something mundane like working at a desk. I inflict pain on myself for no reason at all whether it be slamming my kicking the corner of a wall or punching myself in my thighs or arms to the point where I bruise.  


But more than all of this, I wake up feeling sad. I wake up in the middle of the night crying over seemingly nothing then get angry about crying.  There's always a feeling of ""why do anything at all"", ""why wake up anymore?"", ""what am I good for?"". I don't look both ways when crossing the street anymore. Every time I see my window I think about jumping, waiting for a cab comes accompanied by thoughts of, ""you could just jump in front of the next car that comes by"" I never act on any of these but the thought these scare and anger me.  


I won't answer any questions regarding to where I'm stationed, and what my job is. I have had posts I make brought up at my job already. I will say that I'm at a Non-Combat overseas duty station however.

115,"Am i ( 18M) in love or am i just so desperate of affection that i think that i am in love?

So yeah  I am 18 years old about 3 weeks ago i was just messing around dming random girls just sliding but and i ended up talking to one girl that i really liked talking to but she lives in America i live in Belgium so the distance is pretty far. After a few days i noticed how anxious i became like heart beatings i couldn't sleep, i couldn't eat anything, i kept thinking about her i literally have dreams about her, but i tried to ignore since she lives so far away and i thought to my self how am i in love with someone that i have never seen in my life nor have i heard her talk the only form of communication was through dms. After about 2 weeks i told her that i had feelings for her and she she did too but she got back with her boyfriend so she wanted to just be friends and i agreed because i still care about her and now we still regularly dm but i feel weirded out about the fact that i got in love with someone i barely know. Everytime she goes online and doesn't check my message i fall into some sort of depression and overthink even tho she has a boyfriend i still care so much i don't know if this is normal i have called my doctor for an appointment but since its the holidays he couldn't recieve me so i am not sure if i am losing my mind or if it is a normal thing to feel for someone that i have never met in my life.",25Dec2019,1

117,"I know it’s hard to predict the future especially when you don’t know this person but words of affirmation or maybe similar stories of people you know would help. 

Essentially, these past few years have been really hard for my brother who has suffered with mental illness since a young age. Recently it has resulted in a suicide attempt and eventually entered a facility to address these issues. He is doing a lot better than before and seems more like himself again, however, heavily relying on my parents for emotional support (when he has crises/panic attacks/breakdowns) and has intense insecurity/fear that prevents him from moving forward. He has graduated college and has had some part time work but has not ever had a salary paying job or an actual career. 

Is this just a rock bottom for my brother in his life? I am worried he will never be able to live on his own, have his own career/life, and be more independent from my parents. My mom even told me once that I was going to have to take care of him once my parents were both gone which was pretty stressful for me to think I would already have to take care of my older brother...",25Dec2019,1

For days I just stay on bed, with no motivation and no energy even to do such small things like washing my face or brushing my teeth. Worst of all, I even thought of suicide. I contacted my friends so they could help distract me from the idea, but they either didn't take me seriously or thought I was being whiny and overdramatic.

123,"So it's been 13 months since we broke up. I am 24 she is 23.1

We were together for 4 years. Our relationship was toxic and now I'm out if it I could see it.

When struggled with bad anxiety and depression. And I made it one of my priorities for the past 4 years to try and save her from that so we could be fully happy together.

It was my 1st relationship and recognised the red flags but chose to ignore them as I see the best in people.

I would make her music videos for her music. As she wanted to be a singer. And we spent most of our time helping her grow. I felt I was tredding on eggshells.

She would question her life alot and dishearten herself to the point she would worry me and it would keep me awake some nights. I'd always be checking on her.

We were happy. But I think I sacrificed so much getting her out of it. I didn't have any time to myself and she relied on me so heavily. The finally two years together I was in some really tough jobs where I was mistreated.

I developed a hormone imbalance and seratonin deficiency. Which I didn't find out about until this year. But I was visibly struggling and told my ex last year, the year of our break up that I don't feel good.

I went from being happy guy everyone loved to introverted and I could barely function or speak. I suffered from extreme brainfog, anxiety and constant fatigue. It was so confusing and I was so lost.

But I had to be strong and my ex told me it's just work stress as well as my mother. They made me feel as if nothing was wrong so I believed them.

It got worse and worse and I closed away from everyone due to the heavy symptoms. Then my ex left... I begged and begged for months as I didn't want to be alone in that darkness.

Her excuse was I didn't put in the effort or gave her attention. So most of last year she was talking to another dude online. She would post tweets prior to our break up about heart break is coming...

She didn't help me at all. She convinced all her friends I let her down and I look like the bad guy.

I feel hurt. Now she's dating some model. She moved on in about 4 months. And is with him... Funny they met on set of a music video and it was about our break up and he was acting me....

She normally goes from relationship to relationship. And she hates being alone. As as soon as I fell ill and off she messaged another guy and reconnects with all friends.

Then she calls me and tells me she only kept me around so she wouldn't be alone. She always posted about being EMPTY before our relationship and during. 

She told me she loved me and wanted to marry me. But I feel I was just a fix to fill this empty void she carries.

What type of person is this? Is this a personality disorder. Like my friends knew something wasn't right and tried to help me but my ex would tell them I'm fine and lead me off the trail.

Unlike her I have been working on myself and trying to get to the bottom of what took me out last year. I've been on different diets and antidepressants and hormone therapy to sort it all out.

Still not 100% there. But I feel like me again and better. But I still just feel like confused as to how a person could do this. She seemed so nice and sweet.

My mother and friends never trusted her intentions as I have more than she gave me.",25Dec2019,1

128,"So my aunt it schizophrenic and unmedicated. He schizophrenia didn't kick in until she was about 30. She believes she is the messiah. She believes that he schizophrenia is a gift and that medicine is a vector of a socially and mentally blinding agent that keeps people from knowing the ""truth"". She doesn't go to the doctor and she recently adopted a cat that she won't neuter or get vaccinated. She lives with my family because she's been kicked out of every where she's been as she always starts trouble. She even got kicked out of a homeless shelter she believes white people are ALL racist and black people are rapists and that that Mexicans are con artists. She also believes that Puerto rican people re the ""chosen people that speak god's language"". She often speaks to 'other' people through the ""mental process"" (in Spanish, English and tongues) about people that live in the house and it's aggravating in the least. She never cleans anything except her dishes after she cooks (fuck wiping the counters). There's way more but this is all I can think of right now. Despite all this every one tries to keep a level head with her but recently she's been taking things from my room, being rude to my cat, calling me names, and just being an overall bitch. No one can ever say anything to her because when you do she just claims that she is the messiah and therefore she can do no wrong.

Please tell me someone has something to help. I literally downloaded this app and made an account just for this. My parents keep saying she needs to get medicated or they're gonna kick her out but that was 3 months ago. She can't hold a job so she'd be out on the streets again.",25Dec2019,1
129,"I sent this to my bestfriend at 1am, this morning.  


cue rant:

fuck man. i think this insomnia is taking a step further than it has in the past. if i dont get some good sleep tonight, i think i need to address this more seriously. lets talk tomorrow or thursday&lt;3

I just went to a family party and was completely dead/falling asleep the whole first two hours. Seriously, I was completely miserable. I started drinking (probably 7+ drinks total throughout the night and later i had a 60mg edible that was a gift from my cousin) and perked right up.  I mean i got to the point where i felt completely normal. i was not drunk or stoned, i could keep a conversation perfectly. I proceeded to get home at 11pm to have the most clear headed conversation i’ve had with my dad since i can remember. we spoke up until now about US politics in depth. literally for over an hour and a half. 

i guess with sleepless nights, extreme lows are occasionally greeted with extreme highs. i havent felt this happy or clear headed in months and its slightly frightening. why am i feeling this good against the odds? how do i make this my baseline? 

Over the past two days, i have slept no more than 6 hours. The day prior to those days i slept maybe 4-5 hours. id like to add im pretty good about keeping track of how late i stay up. i tend to check the time a lot after a certain point of not being able to fall asleep. i realize this has a negative impact on my ability or chances of falling asleep. this literally hasn’t happened yet. the lack of sleep im facing at the moment, that is. 

I don’t know what needs to change, but i have been thoroughly aware that i am mentally and physically unwell for a while. I want to change this specifically on a day to day basis but i somehow fall short every time i try. I muster the motivation and it dies off within weeks. I’ve been stuck in a cycle for what feels like years. Knowing what i need to change, knowing how i need to change those things, begin changing those habits, and eventually failing, going back to the start. 

God damn i know habits are habits for a reason. But I never could have expected changing toxic habits or an unhealthy lifestyle to be so difficult. 

end rant. i am literally a piece of burnt toast at this point. lets talk get together soon man. 

[just kidding]


If I recall correctly, I had: 4 heinakins, 2 lawsons,  1 lagunitas, and three shots/swigs from a bottle of jack daniels.  

At this point in the night I feel as if I’m probably tired enough to fall asleep.  Who knows i guess, ill probably lay down and toss and turn until 4am anyways.  But whats keeping me awake right now is this wild mental state im in. I feel so clear headed i don’t want to it to end.

This clear headedness is what i crave on a day to day basis. I know i’m capable of this and i know its somewhere within me. I feel so inspired and motivated right now, it’s absolutely insane.  

I spend my days wallowing in myself and accepting every form of self pity. I’m constantly beating down on myself; Criticizing myself for mistakes made. You should have known better. You’ve made that mistake before. Whatever the reason is, somehow its
my fault. This pessimistic, constant blaming of myself is toxic. How do I break this headspace?

Maybe I’m a sociopath, but it feels like I’m hyper aware or hyper sensitive. Maybe this is a form of OCD or just a general manifestation of my anxiety.  

I can’t tell you how good this feels. I feel like I completely hit the nail on the head.  For months I have been so stuck in my head and unable to express how I truly feel. I genuinely hope to wake up in the morning to find out this whole rant makes coherent sense and isn’t some sort of sleep deprived delusion.",25Dec2019,1
130,"A lot of you guys are gonna call me a crackhead but whatever. My boyfriend and I both suffer from Depression and I suffer from anxiety. We've been dating for 2 years and the first year of our relationship was ROCKY. We were both facing our own challenges but in addition to that he was an addict. He did just about anything he could get his hands on, (except crazy shit like heroin meth and crack). So when he came to me with the idea of trying acid I shut him down completely. I thought he was just being an addict. Over time I could see the research he had done on it. Testing it to make sure it's real, sourcing it safely, doing it in the proper setting and the proper people and dosing. I caved in. We first tried it alone separately. Idk what his experience was like but I know that I felt more aware of everything I already knew. Everything became beautiful it was what I imagine seeing color for the first time is like for people who are color blind. That one trip didn't do it for me though. I kinda got emotional embedded in th fact that he didn't want to trip with me the first time and would rather do it with his friends who were also addicts. 6 months later we microdosed together and our relationship got stronger than it ever was. He had always done this thing where he'd get into a really dark mood and just self-depricate the fuck out of himself for days at a time so much that I never knew what to say to him and he would try to avoid me. A year later we tripped together again. We were both in a really dark spot. It was close to the anniversary of his father's death. And he was jobless living in my moms house 3000 miles from his family and friends. I was failing all my college classes, being barked at by work and my mom for my boyfriend not having a job or a High school diploma. Like yeah, I put myself in a really bad situation. While we were tripping about 6 hours in he starts this like monologue where he's just talking about all the saddest shit that has ever happened to him and how he's never gonna be anything more than what he has always been and I just stopped him. I told him to shut the fuck up, and started flailing my arms in the air. He couldn't help but start laughing and so did I. I told him he was a dumbass if he thought that his past dictates his future and that no matter what life is about progressing emotionally, financially, physically and in every other way possible. He just kinda took those words and it eradicated 75% of his depression, well at least it did for me. Over the next few weeks he kept self-deprecating but he just kinda stopped over time and I haven't heard him self-deprecating since. I still have my moments where I'm just fucking down but I learned not to let my self be down all the time. The two things I had to teach myself was 1. An object in motion will stay in motion and an object at rest will stay at rest unless acted on by another force... And 2.  The past is unchanging so there's literally no reason to dwell on it. You can think about being abused 100x a day but it won't change the fact that you got abused :/. The future however is undetermined so you can make of it what you want using the present... cause it's a gift, and your life right now is a gift. If none of that helped change your thinking, then just don't kill yourself cause you'll make me sad k, so don't hurt my feelings. 
I'd also like to mention that our room was a disgusting mess and I intentionally wanted to trip in the dirty room so that we would have to face the reality of how we were carrying ourselves and caring for ourselves. We learned that we weren't caring for ourselves and that's where we started controlling our depression.

131,"I trust some people and I can't speak to them because I'M such a burden. I am 15 and the people I trust are usually female teachers. Not anything weird, it's just who I trust. But I'm also a lesbian so it's usually perceived as crushes. I just trust them. Yesterday I went to a carolling thing with the school. I sang with a group of people, outside of a church. My music teacher was conducting the band and us so that was cool. Already I didn't feel great but instead of telling anyone, I just kind of laughed it off. I mean you should be asking why I went if I didn't feel right, right? It's because singing and music usually distracts me and plus, I really trusted this Music teacher. I trusted her enough to help me if I had a blip. And I did. Once the carolling finished, I walked into the church because I left my stuff in there and I guess I just started talking to God and Jesus. I asked them about the higher power and I was just talking to myself for a bit until my music teacher walked in. I don't know if she sensed if something was off but she stood with me until I finished up and asked me what i was thinking. So I told her and she listened and then told me that we don't know. I think she was a bit wary of what to say as I've had a few breakdowns and heard voices and believed stuff that wasn't true. I can say now that I was believing stuff that wasn't true and I think she recognised it. So I finished and another woman walked in and asked how I was getting home and I said bus, my music teacher seemed a bit worried but I shrugged it off and we walked out side. I had a mini conversation with her but then it sorta clicked that I was telling her stuff the higher power didn't want me to tell her so I kinda pushed past a few people and sprinted away and she called my name and I ignored it. I felt really bad but I needed to calm down. I ran to the bus stop and the higher power and I had a heated discussion. I was waiting there for 10 minutes, probably less but it felt like a lot of time. 

As I was talking to the higher power, a car pulled up on the pavement and I stepped back, confused and scared until I looked into the window and saw my teacher and her husband. They said they were going to drop me home and I was grateful but also sceptical but I got in because I figured maybe this time the higher power was wrong. I stayed silent for most of the journey but I tried to stay a part of it but it's difficult to be part of the 'present' when so many other things are going on. I think they thought I was being rude and I feel so bad, I feel like such a burden. They didn't have to drop me home and I just acted so stupid and rude. They probably hate me now. I got drunk earlier and messaged my teacher on an app for homework and explained it. Honestly, I only explained it because I was drunk. I feel bad, I feel terrible and I can't help but feel like they both hate me because I was off with them. I don't know what to do...",25Dec2019,1

134,"First post on this account but felt I needed to vent anonymously...

2019 has been the single worst year of my life... 
 But I don’t really speak to people about it as I’m 16 and feel that for some reason it makes my problems a little less valid... especially to the older generation. 

Truthfully the start of this year looked really promising for me I had left school at 15 to start a college cookery course I had a girlfriend, great relationships with all my friends and family.

Things went downhill fairly slowly at the start, I suddenly lost all motivation to go to college and as an alternative I would go hang out with friends, this somewhere around March turned into skipping college to go drinking , maybe twice a week. 

Then in may time my girlfriend at the time broke up with me, this hit really hard and I started drinking more (this was by no means heart break induced drinking) it was just a case of the break was a lot to deal with and drinking did make it easier to not spend my time dwelling on it. 

During the course of the break up I started drinking around 3-5 times a week. 
Me and this girl did get back together but my drinking didn’t stop, it seems it became almost habitual if you want to describe it that way. 

During the course of our relationship I drank anytime I could get my hands on a bottle but it never really came between us (there were a few discussions, debates, arguments over the frequency of my drinking but nothing serious) 

Fast-forward to June time
Me and my girlfriend are broken up again and at this point I’m drinking everyday and I’m out of a job as I’ve lost it. 
I don’t see the consequences of my drinking as I’m lying to myself telling myself that it’s not a problem and I’m only 16 and have plenty of time to sort myself out and alcoholism would never be an issue for me.

Since me and this girl have broken up I’m not the same within myself, but I still act like normal me (if that makes sense) 

My drinking continues into getting ruined everyday more or less

Fast-forward to October 
Still drinking everyday, my parents notice I’m coming home drunk a lot, and there’s a total relationship breakdown, the break up between this girl is more or less destroying me at this point I am drinking to cope with feeling lonely and more or less just being sad, I’m no longer drinking for fun or a distraction it’s just becoming something along the lines of self medicating. 

My parents realise they can’t handle seeing what I’m doing to myself anymore and they kick me out. 

I go to the council and they give me a flat in a well known area of my town it’s known for drug addiction and alcohol misuse problems, I have a drug and alcohol councillor.

My friends are starting to notice somethings up with me and also try to get me to gain control of my drinking again. 

I ended up getting in debt with rent . 

In the past few weeks I’ve stopped drinking as much where I can, and have moved home on the condition that the drinking stops. 

For the past 6 months or so I’ve just been either lonely, sad, or feel like I’m no good or there’s no hope for me and I don’t know if I’m depressed. 
The reason for my post is because I don’t know how to really just pinpoint where I’m at in my head.

Side note: I take full responsibility for my actions and the positions I’ve landed myself in 

This post was not I sift blame or to speak bad of anyone

Me and my ex are best friends and meet most days,",25Dec2019,1

136,"To anyone who will listen 

I’m personally killing my mental health. I’m sitting with my family on Christmas and I can’t even fake smile. I know it’s not right but every day that passes I feel more comfortable with the thought of dying. I’ve been to 3 mental health hospitals this year. Blew my 18 months of sobriety. But again this is me hurting myself, I’ve stopped taking meds. I’ve stopped going to outpatient. Being truthfully honest I’ve just stopped and gave up. I can’t make anyone understand how I feel but I wish 90% of the time I wish I didn’t wake up. I cry because I want to die but I can’t do anything. There has been days where I have a razor against my arm or a hand full of sleeping pills. I’m so close to the edge. Everything feels so hard to get passed. I’m using so much energy just trying to make it through the day. 

My life isn’t that bad. Stressful but I have a somewhat good life. I’m just tired of living.

My family and friends love me, I get along with people at school, I get good grades, etc. But I just don't feel right. I don't feel happy. I feel incompetent. I feel like a complete idiot, even though my grades say otherwise. It's difficult to cope with. I have a lot of hobbies, but I'm now losing interest in them for some reason. I don't know what to do.

138,"Last night I made a post on Facebook opening up about my journey with Bipolar type 2. This was it.

""Okay so as many of you know I battled a bit 6-8 years ago and went through a pretty rotten journey and took ALOT of people down with me. Many, to this day still can't bring themselves to talk to me because of what I did and I totally respect and understand why.. for years I apologized and tried to make up for what I did. But I finally come to terms with the fact I can't take back what happened and how much i stuffed up. Each episode was branded as 'drug induced psychosis', put on a course of meds for a year that was that. For years after though I still questioned why the hell do I still feel like I'm not right. Is this just me?

Because of my episodes I had to quit drugs completely.. and just except that drugs screwed me over and that was it.

Years down the track after I had the kids I was battling and had got an appointment with a psychiatrist over Skype.. not drinking at all and no drugs what so ever. and boom. Here I am being told I'm Bipolar type II and needed to be put on meds. I sat in the car crying because the realisation of not being able to breastfeed anymore shattered me. But then it really hit. What people had told me or friends of friends had mentioned and it got back to me that it instantly get offended over.. I was finally told the news I knew since I was a teen.

What you do is not normal and there is nothing wrong with you. Doesn't sound right does it? But it was the most right I'd ever felt in my whole life.

Bipolar is a pretty hefty, easily judged label to have.. and I know certain people in my friends list will be pretty blown out that I'm even bringing up the crazy on my Facebook.

I think what the world needs more of is knowledge. Not on everything around them, but the awareness of ourselves. Awareness leads to better understanding of why we do the things we do and the affect we have on other people. And mainly what we can do to make our own life better which leads to happiness.. for us and everyone around us.""

All I got was positive feedback. This morning I've woken up realising I'm ready to quit smoking. Things are about to get alot better.",25Dec2019,1
139,"First off,let me say,merry christmas and happy 2020.  


And,I won't say sorry for my North Korea bullshit. Because,all things considered,sorry just means jack shit. Instead,let's just forget that ever happened.  


Also,Koreans and Chinese were never the problem...my own damn brain was(I hate mental illness so fucking much,why the everloving hell do I have to have shit like this?)...And,I'm tired of being a little turd about shit.  


Kim Jong can still go eat a fucking dick though...However,I do wish North Korea would just get a damn grip already.  


But anyway,Let me tell you a silly ass story as to why I had such a hate on for Korean folks.  


You see,I wasn't always like this...I never really had a problem with Korean folks at all,in fact,I don't know much(and still dont) about them. But that all changed on two separate occasions during my time in community college in NYC.  


The first occasion was when I tried to chat up this Korean girl who was reading a book(In retrospect,I was wrong for bothering her in the first place. ) And all I was trying to do was to try and see if I could find out about what she was reading and try to make friends with her(and admittedly...I wanted to get in her pants..so sue me,I have yellow fever,what can you do?  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ ) and all the while,I was talking to her in a respectful manner...  


...Until she turned into a total bitch on me...Again,I was wrong for talking to her when she was trying to read in the first place,but at the same time,wanting to tear my throat out doesn't really put her in the right either.  


The second occasion was when I saw another Korean girl(again,yellow fever,what can you do?  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ ) who looked rather hot(let me tell you:Sexual frustration is a fucking bitch -\_-) and she...looked like she was in some distress.  
Again,I was in the wrong here,I should've left her alone,but she was in pain,and I genuinely wanted to help her(despite also wanting to get in her pants.) So,I tried to talk to her,to try and offer her a shoulder to cry on...  


And,as it was in the first occasion:Death penalty.  


(Well,of course not really,but she turned into a bitch on me.)  


And then,later on(like a few minutes later)I saw the woman all smiles with,who I believed was her boyfriend.  


So the end result was that because of these two incidents,I became fully convinced that Korean girls were utterly brutal and I made a particular effort to avoid them. This continued until I went to a 4-year college and had a Japanese professor who was half-korean herself(and honestly,one of the best human beings I have had the pleasure of knowing). The lady was cool. And then there was this cool Korean dude in my AFROTC unit(I was trying to get into the Air Force at the time) and he was a great human being himself(honestly wonder how he's doing now and if he's alright).  


And then I had to leave NYC(Because shitty family) and come to Florida...and then came trump,North Korea's nonsense,and then the rest is sad,ridiculous history.  


So,in short,I hated Koreans...Because I had two Korean girls that turned into bitches on me.  


I denigrated a nation of not only MILLIONS...but Koreans in the damn U.S...because of two girls who would amount to less than 1% of that population.....  


Ok,Ok...don't laugh too hard,ok? My brain was being an asshole to me and Mental illness fucking sucks.  


And the thing is:Koreans,Chinese,they're not even that bad at all! And politically,China did what they could with North Korea,and how North Korea is is practically out of their hands.   


But,at least if North Korea wants to bite the hand that feeds them,then North Korea can get themselves ready to be eaten by a dragon.  


But,I digress.  


Koreans,Chinese,Korea,China...  


They were NEVER the problem...My life was the problem.  


I'm a sexually frustrated black man with anger issues that hates the fuck outta Florida and that my life has not gone nowhere near the way I wanted it to go...and yet here I am using countries as punching bags.  


Such nonsense.  


I've had it with that shit.  


I don't know the future,I won't claim to know the future,and I sure as hell  not gonna fucking predict the future.  


I just want to progress and live life. Enough is enough.  


And besides,I can't hate Koreans and Chinese either..their women are too hot(among other things too.)  


But,this doesn't mean that I won't criticize them if need be. Saying that I don't want them to be exterminated  anymore doesn't mean freedom from criticism. I could go on and on about what's wrong with Korea and China..but now I'm not gonna say oh,""We're gonna die because of them"" or bullshit like that.  


Fuck OCD and depression and anger and the lies and bullshit that they feed you.  


At least,if nothing else,you at least know the reason why I came off as such a insane ,deranged git:I get angry:My brain sends me into this ""autopilot"" where I end up running myself into the ground.  


Damn...and the thing is,how the hell do you resist when these shitty,bullshit thoughts and lies pop up yet again?  


I don't want this ever again.  


I mean,for all the brutality and assholery people on reddit have subjected me to,they are right on one thing:I DO need help.  


I hope my therapist can give me some more effective help...I don't want this shit anymore.  


I want to make things right. I want to live right..I don't want this nonsense and lies that my brain feeds me anymore.  


I want to be a man and not a little bitch(for lack of a better term.)

140,"How do you mentally figure out whether something is actually real or not? One of my rules is that if it's something to due with everyone around me, it's probably just paranoia but sometimes I can't tell.

Usually it's the small paranoid thoughts that get me, the big ones are easily pointed out as not real once I have woken up the next day. But subtle ones like everyone acting strange around me is hard to process to where I accept whether it's real or not.

Also, it's different for everyone but at least for me, even if I tell myself I'm just being paranoid it doesn't matter. Until I have a reason to believe it is, there's no way for me to let it go. Larger delusions are easy to disprove so I can let them go. But yeah these small ones get really tricky and I don't know if it's actually real and not a delusion, or if it's just part of my side effects.


It's pretty personal so I feel weird writing this but, idk I'm hoping someone who's had it much worse or for longer would help out. Also, I have terrible communication for some reason and sound like I'm being mean when I swear I'm not. That's been a huge problem online and in real life",25Dec2019,1

4. I've lost all motviation
5. I don't want to talk to my friends anymore

1. Due to this lack of motivation and caring, I'm failing two classes. My parents have no idea. They'll have to find out soon. This quarter is coming to an end soon. The other part of me says 'eh whatever, they'll get over it'. Still, I feel like I don't deserve anything good right now because of it.
2. Passive suicidal thoughts. I say passive because I have no real intentions to harm myself. There isn't a plan. The thought just crosses my mind at least once a day, usually 2 or 3 times. Still no actual intention though. The thing is, the fact that I'm having these thoughts makes me feel bad. I guess it just sounds like it would be rude to my family. After all they've been through they don't need anything else to happen. Is it rude of me to just not want to be here sometimes?

146,"Dear Reddit, I need someone to talk about my family problem(s).
First of all I (21M) am not a native speaker, so there could be some mistakes. Sorry for that!
Now my story: It all started with the divorce of my parents last year. It was relatively obvious that it would happen sometime, so it didn‘t hit me as hard as my younger siblings because I saw it coming long ago. They was always something that caused my mother to be mad at my dad. This in connection with to much alcohol led to some serious fights. And my dad had to apologize most of the time even if my mom caused everything.
What‘s funny, is that to the outside we looked like the perfect family: Both of my parents are dentists and I was the kid all parents wish for. With perfect grades, not stressing the boundaries (because of a very strict upbringing) and some friends. (I was hiding mental health problems for most of the time because there was no possible way for me to talk about them. I was always just telling them what they wanted to hear.)

This was the reason I moved out directly after school to study, so I could live on my own. My mom called nearly every day which was a „tell her something so she is happy“-show but I did this especially for my dad and my siblings so my mom was satisfied. 

Then, during the divorce last year my dad started to tell me some things about my mother. Some that I already knew and some that were new to me (multiple times of cheating which he ignored because he loved her etc.) which got me even angrier so I started to completely ignore her. I had to ignore many calls and texts of her explaining herself and apologizing. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. 
At new years morning my dad came to me, to tell me that I am most likely not his son and my mom kept this secret for the last 20 years. At this point I decided that I no longer knew the person I once called ‚mom‘ and just wanted to cut her out of my life. 
I also decided to not tell my siblings because they have a much stronger bond to my mother so telling them could cause anything. This is why I kept this secret and told only my best friends about it.
The worst thing about this is that they do not understand why I regret the presents that she gives me regardless of me throwing them away or giving them back to my sister so she can return them to my mother. 
The same thing happened this Christmas where they gave me another unwanted present which I did not open. What’s hurting me most are their thoughts and faces saying :“why is he is he so unforgiving“. 
Also she does not stop calling/texting me even today. The only reason I did not block her is the last bit of respect I have for a person that raised me, so that I could be informed if she is in some serious trouble. I don’t know, maybe I should have blocked her months ago. She even drove to my place (around a 3 hour drive) and knocked whining on my door last month. I wish I had the courage to just close the door but it was like 10 in the morning and I was still half sleeping (long night) so I let her in. She was there the whole day which was horror for me but I (this is where the strict upraising kicks in) was not able to tell the truth so I immediately fell into the „perfect son telling things she wants to hear“ mode and just tried to hide my feelings. I was so relieved when she left but the last month was just bad for me.

After the presents from yesterday and her visit last month I clearly have to do something but I am too weak to do anything.",25Dec2019,1
147,"I(M32) have a long history of severe depression with suicidal thoughts and autodestructive behaviour. 
I was more than few times at psychiatry, periods of few weeks to few months. But it's like ping pong, I have hard time mainting myself stable. 
I was on alot of antidepressants and antipsychotics but had wierd side effects, paranoia, sleep problems, alcohol cravings, feeling like a robot, and total blockage of any social interactions. only thing that mildly helped without much side effects was mirtazapine with sulpiride but it quickly stopped working. 
I had a few traumas in childhood(rape, suicides) but i don't feel like I'm like this because of them, I got over them, they are just part of my past. 
I also have a nice loving wife, 3yo kid, I love them and they are everything to me but I don't feel good around them and they sometimes make me awfuly depressed. I planed my suicide and if I was solo I'd already finish this. but I don't want to be selfish bastard and ruin their lifes, but my problems are agony for my family. 
Probably my biggest problem is that I have hard time keeping any job, I work hard and do my best but people don't like to work with me because I'm quiet and can't get along with strangers. 
I'd go to psychiatry again already but have debts to bank and can't afford free time or they'll take my house and block all my accounts. 
I'm thinking all day about suicide, dream of it, I'd say I kinda romanticize suicide. I wonder, if I comit suicide, my kid is so young so I think it wouldn't affect him, but if I keep living my behaviour would then do to them even more harm. 
I feel totaly traped, last few weeks are rapidly worsening, I lost all sexual desires, I recieve love from my family but it kinda doesn't even reach me, it's like I'm blocked from emotions. Talking to anyone isn't any help, I hate when someone feels pity for me or even speaks like I'm a victim, but thats probably because they can't understand my mental state.
I'm posting here so maybe I can get some advices, and can you tell me would it really be a bad thing to commit suicide? Or if someone was in my situation and found drug that helped? Anything?

Throughout my life I've had some friends, I've had some good times, but they're massively outweighed by the times I've gotten bullied, judged and laughed at. I also walk funny so I avoid people as much as I can and walking on a sidewalk with someone walking towards me brings me insurmountable anxiety to the point where I take out my phone and stop walking. I'm insanely self conscious about everything I do and how I move and I've grown to hate myself because of it. I hate the fact that I sit, stand and walk like an absolute fucking idiot.

149,"So guys and gals. I have made this discovery in my own mental health adventure. Most people will tell you, if you go to them for help, that you dont want to help yourself. Most of us had forgotten how to actually fucking do that! But guys, I can really say its as easy as actually TRYING to be happy. One thing i found very helpful to do was just look in the mirror and tell myself that i was amazing. And tell myself how great i was at the things i love doing. Whether or not other people think im great. Its all about me. Hence you dont help YOURSELF. You help others and you help friends and family and you know how to do that but you cant remember how to ""be happy"" and you forget in this how to try and be happy. This is personal experience, and it doesnt apply to everyone. Dont forget. No one else matters. The only person YOU KNOW for a FACT are real is yourself. So stop trying to get others approval. I 100% can promise you guaranteed results if you look into the mirror, force a smile, and point out all of the qualities that make you beautiful. Depression is a horrible loop that a lot of people dont know how to get out of. This is just my way i would explain it to my past depressed self. Because when you hear that ""you cant help yourself"" or ""you need to fix this"" you dwell on the fact that you need to fix it rather than fixing it.  Like i said, all personal experience.

151,"I constantly repeat things I hear in my head (OCD most likely, but I’ll get to the weird part) but lately, I can’t even hear my own thoughts, the ones repeating things I just heard.

My brain puts everything on instant playback, but as of lately I’ve been unable to hear the playbacks clearly, and my brain has to play them back over and over until I can hear them, exactly right and in the exact same voice of the person who said it.

I also count the syllables of it, and those play in the persons voice (the person who said it) too. 

Each number counting the syllables has to be one syllable too, since each number represents one syllable. 

Example; Seven is shortened to “sev” and eleven is shortened to “lev”.

It’s been going on for so long that I’m used to it, but it still gives me headaches, and while my brain is trying to repeat the stuff said correctly, all of my mental RAM (focus and attention) is occupied by that, so I’ll just stare forward kind of paused, and my brain freaks out if it can’t do this immediately.

152,"26f. I don't even know where to begin, but I will try.

I started having anxiety from a very young age. I was homeschooled so I didn't have any opportunities to branch out of it. When I was 6 years old I developed misophonia. This made me have very low self-esteem and I withdrew a lot from social situations. My family always said I was just shy and that was my excuse I thought I would grow out of, but it never happened.

I started having OCD really bad when I was 14. I would have intense intrusive thoughts that were so disturbing I'd throw myself against things in an attempt to get my mind to think about something else. I would chew and eat my own hair. I would pray endlessly for forgiveness over the intrusive thoughts I thought were mine. It was horrible. 

My family didn't really know a lot about mental illness. I didn't talk about what I was going through with them because I didn't really think it would be met with understanding. They took me to the doctor one time and I was prescribed Paxil and was supposed to see a therapist but I weaseled my way out of it because I was too scared. Looking back now I wish I would have done it and tried therapy.

I'm 26 years old now. Still socially anxious and possibly depressed. My misophonia affects a lot of my life. It is hard for me to work and be around others. I fear people finding out I have misophonia and I seclude myself a lot. Every time I step out of my apartment I feel like I have to go incognito to prevent anyone seeing how messed up I really am. At work I am in fight or flight all day long. And I stutter too so that ruins my self-esteem because I get laughed at and hung up on at work sometimes. It's tiring. 

I never had any friends. When I was eleven I had one best friend but she moved away after a year. I spent my teen years alone spent on the computer and hiding from my family. I was put in dance lessons around that time but it was too late, I didn't really have any social skills and couldn't make friends with the girls in my class. 

As of right now my only social contact outside of Internet is my sister and her family, and my dad sometimes once a week. I am grateful but still feel lonely. I don't have much in common with them and it feels like my main role is that of a babysitter. I want friends who I can go and do stuff with and talk about life with. But I know my social skills are subpar and it is hard for me to start conversations. 

I have plans of trying a church soon, but the very thought of walking into one all by myself scares the crap out of me. But I know I have to do something. Because I don't think my social anxiety is ever going to resolve itself. I want to see a therapist but I don't have good health insurance and I can't really afford it. I have one last Klonopin in my purse that was filled last June by my primary doctor before my health insurance changed over. They are out of my network now. I don't know what to do.",25Dec2019,1

All while this was happening my dad got a cancer diagnosis and I began using drugs to cope. I had every reason to end it. One day I simply had enough and climbed up on the school roof. I wanted to jump, and I would have if it werent for a guy that walked by down on the schoolyard. I locked eyes with him and felt that I couldnt jump in front of someone else. So I climbed back down.
Now my life is a lot better (if you want to know how things got better, just ask me in the comments), but I'm feeling just as miserable as I did back then.

I don't know if I can do it anymore. I don't know if I can make it to college. Living in this house everyday makes me so absurdly sad. I'm almost to the point of attempting suicide. I don't want to fail and end back up in the mental hospital. I don't want to ruin my girlfriend's life. I don't want to disappoint everyone.

Every day it just gets harder for me to move on, wake up, get out of bed. I don't even want to play video games anymore. I'm so scared that I won't be able to control myself  one day and I will do something drastic. I just want to be happy. Adults tell me that family is 'forever' and that you will always be in contact with your parents. I just want an escape. I've never done drugs before in the slightest or anything illegal for that matter but I just don't know where else to go.

I do not feel pleasure from sexual activities anymore. Every time I masturbate I feel instant overwhelming guilt. So many problems are stemming from my toxic family atmosphere and I would so greatly appreciate what people in similar situations have done to progress onwards and make it to the next milestone in their lives regardless of horrible family atmosphere. I'm so lost and afraid of what I might result to doing in an altered state that I will accept all advice and criticism. I'm not looking for an instant fix, I'm not looking for magic, I just really need any piece of advice.",25Dec2019,1
160,"This is probably my need to vent too but I'm honestly curious if there are people out there feeling like this.
I noticed that I have 2 different personalities within me at first I didn't give it much thought I thought it was just a bad day but I've started noticing it more and more and even people told me that from the nice and kind person that I am sometimes I'm very cold.
I'll just call them personality #1 and personality #2.

#1 is the personality that I know for sure I am, a kind, caring person, friendly, honest and very empathic but and when I'm #2 I'm more spontaneous, impulsive, even angry at times, I'm feeling empty and emotionally detached from everything I wouldn't give a damn if I hurt anyone (I don't think to consequences then) I just want to do what I want to do but after a time that #2 is going back to being #1 and I feel regretful for what I've said and done and even hate myself now reading what I've written it sounds like I'm crazy probably but I just wanted to see if there are more people like this and to vent and if someone knows more about this subject they could tell me if it's something that I should worry about.",25Dec2019,1
161,"My dad is married to a woman I absolutely hate and she hates me. When I was a kid she and her children both emotionally abused me. I still haven’t gotten over it even as an adult. I avoid them as much as I can and only see my dad privately but Christmas I can’t avoid it. It always bothers me but this year I’m really upset by it. It just hit me harder this year. I don’t want to tell my dad that I just can’t do this next year, but I don’t know what else to do for my mental health.",25Dec2019,1
162,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I began suspecting myself of Asperger's two years or so ago when I read into the symptoms of Asperger's in girls and watched some videos on YouTube by experts on the topic. My whole life I can only say has been tinged by loneliness - I can hardly say if I was a studious child because I was lonely, or vice versa; they probably played into each other a lot. At my best, I can be loving and witty and get along with everyone, and I love learning and am passionate about science. At my worst, I have episodes where I feel everyone hates me, that I'll always be alone, and that I can have no meaningful conversations with most people. I feel like everyone I talk to secretly wishes I am not there/ that I annoy people/ the people who I love always leave. This is especially exemplified by the first person I ever fell in love with, one day just leaving without a word - and I'll never know why. My current relationship has had so many ups and downs but I feel it's slowly falling apart. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I've gotten into a bad place. I don't know if it's clinical depression - might be just a bout of very low self esteem brought on by dating someone who I think isn't quite right for me, coupled with stress from starting university at a very competitive university (very large workload: I am studying the equivalent of 3 average UK uni courses rolled into one. People who have been here can probably guess which university and course I'm referring to) and the codependence I've built on my boyfriend means that I have barely made any real friends since starting first year - totally my own fault, but it's a common thing for aspies because we so rarely find someone we can wholly love and trust. Can someone give me anything - advice? I'm too scared to go to the GP to get a referral for professional diagnosis and I am not sure how it would help. If I do have Asperger's, I feel like it will doom me for the rest of my life. It's after all, genetic. It is not a behavioural disorder, but how the brain was built to work. The suicide rates for high-functioning autism are (haha ironic adjective use time) depressing to say the least. I do also have SAD so this could be contributing, but I was so much happier during the summer. During the last term of university, I gained 4kg, drank waaaaay too much, slept at whack times, ignored deadlines, skipped lectures, and just generally did not look after myself. My maths supervisor forced me to go to counsellor when one day I turned up to a lesson visibly stressed (this was following a 2 week bout of the worst freshers' flu that wouldn't seem to go away and so I'd missed a few lectures). I traded short term happiness for long term happiness. I thought going to parties and talking to people more would 'fix' my social life, and it did make me feel loved short term, but all it did was stress me out more long term. Deep down, I had given up on myself. I'm a regular exerciser and I used to meditate; I thought I knew how to be happy, but I have lost motivation entirely to meditate and I only exercise out of habit/ because I am genuinely on the road to being a fat shit with all the sugary stuff I ate out of stress and out of sleep deprivation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am waiting to go back to uni to see the college counsellor (my GP at home is really bad) so I can't get professional help right now. Anyone got any informal words of advice?

Also sorry for depressing post on Christmas - hope people are having a good time, whatever religion you celebrate.",25Dec2019,1
163,"Beyond all the usual ""important"" things that are affected my my depression-anxiety combo, the one that I feel takes the biggest toll on me is that I can never bring myself to finish any enjoyable activity I started; if I'm playing a game, I ""take a break"" when I feel the ending nearing up and then never revisit said game. I watch a TV show and rarely if ever watch the last episode. I pause a movie 3/4 of the way through for a break and I never get around to finishing it.

Whenever I try to get myself to finish any of them I get a panic attack comparable to whenever I fuck myself over with an important life action. If I do manage to finish them all I end up feeling is a depressive episode that sometimes takes me days to get out of. 

Searching and reading about the things I feel is helpful to me, it lightens the burden to know that I am not alone, but for years I've either never seen anything related to this (or haven't been able to use the correct keywords in my search). 

This brings me great pain, I end up seeing the endings of things through memes that pop up on my timeline and then justify myself into not finishing them myself, even though I'd love to experience them myself.

I feel like I've achieved some great lengths into coping with my mental problems, but this is a stone wall that keeps blocking my path: how can I force myself to do things that I do not enjoy if I barely have the energy and will to do things I like? I find myself rewatching and replaying the same things over and over and over again because knowing what's going to happen brings me comfort, even then I still find it hard to watch the endings, even though I already experienced them. It feels like if I end anything a part of me that lived through that is going to end as well, a part that felt... different from my usual self. When I immerse myself in something I forget about everything and I think that ending something means getting rid of a place of comfort. I felt comfortable watching/playing that, I don't want it to end.

I'm making this post because sometimes it feels better for me to write something out and maybe this way I'll get some replies from people who perhaps feel the same way. Sorry for the long post and Merry Christmas to all of you!",25Dec2019,1
164,I’m very grateful for my dog. Every morning we wake up early and walk for an hour around town. It’s really nice to have something consistent when everything else feels so out of control. It’s been a rough couple of days and I’ve had a bad cold and haven’t been able to walk her. I’m feeling a bit better so tomorrow we will go for our walk. I’m really looking forward to it.,25Dec2019,1
165,"Let’s say your life sucks badly. You are jobless, physically disabled (or have cancer) and have no support system. Things like that can make anybody depressed and suicidal. Things like that are always confused with clinical depression.’",25Dec2019,1
166,I don't remember the last time I've looked forward to waking up in the morning or afternoon or any time of the day and doing something. I don't remember how it felt like to feel pumped or excited about an event in the near future. I don't know whether it's the environment around me that has changed or it's me. I can't think of anything that would get me excited or happy or motivated. Is this normal?,25Dec2019,1
