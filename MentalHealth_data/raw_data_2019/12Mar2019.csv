0,This is not as serious as most of the posts on this sub but i was wondering if there is any practical things a person can do to relieve stress from prolonged work. I am a college student who is studying computer science and it seems like i have endless work. Even when i have a two day break to do whatever i want it is ruined by the constanant dread of having to get back to doing my endless math work. At the beginning of the semester i had a huge amount of motivation and i was relatively unphased. It is like a marathon and i am starting to run out of air. I was just wondering if there is any practical (legal) ways that anybody knows of to just escape that constant weight on you for a short time in order to feel refreshed and ready to go at it again,12Mar2019,4
2,"People always spoke about the system and how it is not at all equipped for treating mental illness and I recently encountered this for myself and it is incredibly frustrating. Being diagnosed with mdd, ocd, and generalized anxiety they wouldn’t place me on meds until I see my family doctor. Not sure about elsewhere, but in Canada it is growing increasingly difficult to attain/see a family doctor, and while I have one the visits regarding mental illness are limited and put me on a waiting list of almost two months. Just for a prescription for my meds. Does anybody else feel like it’s a never ending battle crying out for help in our health system? Dealing with this is hard enough but being blown off makes it much more difficult. ",12Mar2019,4
3,"This is going to be kind of a long one, and it would mean a lot if I could maybe get a little advice? Sorry if this is the wrong sub for this, if so just let me know. 

A little background:
I have been a wreck lately. I got divorced last year and ever since then I feel like my life has been a slow and steady spiral in DEEP depression. I have to force myself to shower. I can hardly bring myself to get up to eat in the evenings. I know that I am in a hole and I know that I really need therapy. I have been avoiding the therapy thing because I am massively in debt and struggling to make enough money to live.

My job is incredibly stressful and my work hours are 2AM-10AM. My boss is incredibly bad, she is a micromanager that has no idea how to actually do my jo, which means she is very controlling but also rarely is telling me to do things that actually need done. On top of that we have been short staffed for over a year and corporate will not allow her to hire anyone new, which means that i am often doing the work of 2-3 people and typically at least 2 days a week i dont even get to take my days off because there is too much work to be done. 

For my own sanity, and the fact that i have recently started having suicidal thoughts, I know that I need to get out of this toxic work environment ASAP, but I am having a hard time finding another job that would even come close to supporting my financial needs. 

What am I supposed to do? ",12Mar2019,2

5,"Is it normal for what you want to say to just come to you? Not have to consciously think about it? I say this because a few days ago I felt like that, talking felt very natural and smooth, even though the topic was sad I still enjoyed being able to talk easily. I ask this because if it's normal I might start going to therapy more because I never saw the way I think as a problem but apparently when I describe it to other people it is.",12Mar2019,1
6,"I am trying hard to have a positive attitude.

My doctor finally convinced me I should see someone for my depression(I used to be in and out of therapy for years but haven't been in a few years now). So I made an appointment with the counselor she recommended. The receptionist called me the day before my appointment and said they had to cancel and would call me back to reschedule. They never called back.

Today I called the local mental health services group, left a message to make an appointment, called early in the morning. No call back all day.

It is really hard for me to not get discouraged and a little upset at these situations. It is taking a lot of mental effort to get myself help, why do I have to constantly follow up to get something done and get help? I'm having this problem with my regular doctor as well...terrible follow up and follow through. It is exhausting for me to stay on top of when I barely feel like I can get through the day.

11,"During the end of the summer my mom had a complete mental breakdown and psychotic break. I am the oldest sibling and I still can’t get over it all. No one I know knows about what happened with my family and I’m asking for support or advice with what to do given the circumstances.

My dad kept us all closed out from what was really going and and every time one of us asks they provide very vague answers. My whole family has continued on as if nothing has happened at all but it’s not the same anymore. Everything just feels completely off. My mom is definitely not the same and it really bothers me. She recovered well and the episode only lasted a few days and then things went back to “normal” after about a few weeks. I thought I would be able to get over it by now but for some reason it is really still bothering me especially because the family member is different. 

When I ask my one sibling how they feel they definitely just act like nothing has happened and say something like “yea it’s weird” and that’s it.. it really sucks because I know deep down my dad doesn’t feel the same as before and our whole family equilibrium is off I can sense it. 

I feel like I am partly guilty for this for some reason even though I have done nothing wrong but the way my mom acted towards me during the episode seemed like she hated me. I know that wasn’t really her but it still eats away at me.

It really sucks man. Life’s not the same. All interaction seems forced now. I feel like I’m the only one noticing...and this might be a selfish way to act I don’t know. I’ve really retreated from my friends because I feel guilty or in a fog.

19,"I'm currently 16 female.

Before I get into this, I'd struggled with suicidal thoughts, self harm, attempts of suicide, and prolonged sadness and gloominess for around 8 years before this situation. It had dialed down for a year or so before this as well. ""ended"" at the start of 2017 (January).

Sorry this is long. 

Last year from April to late July/Early August I was extremely extroverted and energized. I was frequently inspired, taking initiative, didn't need more than 2 hours of sleep a night to still be energized, felt like I was on top of the world all the time, honestly.. I felt like the world was amazing and beautiful and I simply was just incredibly happy. There were rare random weeks during these euphoric months that I felt utterly empty and constantly sad though, but then it'd be away and I'd be back to feeling like I was high, almost, and I'd be really hyper, etc. I liked who I was back then, nonetheless. I loved socializing and I would drop everything I was doing to run upstairs and call my friend(s), etc. It was amazing to say the least (excluding my down weeks but the up weeks made up for it and overall I felt happy). Before April, I had been overcoming a wave of despair. It started in mid-to-late November of 2017 and I was constantly tired, sleeping 10-12 hours over the weekend, but during the weekdays I usually could not get more than 2 hours of sleep a night as I'd wake up in increments of 10-30 minutes after falling asleep and take a while to fall asleep (only to wake up soon after as I described). I wore the same clothes to school everyday and spent most of my day pulling my hair out, which, along with my face and the rest of my body, was very much greasy and my hair releasing a musty smell, even I could tell, but my peers often pointed it out. I didn't have enough energy to really do anything. I probably didn't shower for a few months, or several weeks. I didn't try in school so my grades were not up to their potential (had all A's and one B though). I cried nearly every night and would rest my head on my desk or close my eyes on the bus rides to and from school. I tried confiding in my best friend but he did not take me seriously. Once April 2018 came around, I began to experience that energized happiness I previously described. In August of 2018, it went away and it only worsened as each day went by. At this point in time, I've become more introverted and prefer to finish a YouTube video over talking to a friend immediately. I feel as though I've lost myself and who I was. I feel tired most of the time and have been doing horribly in school, bouncing between Cs and Bs in a couple of classes as I cannot get myself to do any work, or I will procrastinate and lead to myself receiving an hour or so of sleep from working on an assignment too late. I used to start projects the second I got home.. I've also been experiencing what I believe to be anxiety but I'm not entirely sure because I've never endured such things before and I'm not trying to self-diagnose anything but I panic often. This happened today too simply because I am supposed to engage in a group call tomorrow morning (which was my idea, so it's stupid of me to be panicking) but anyway, when I start to panic (some worse than others, my first panic being in October) I cannot breathe/struggle to breathe, my chest pounds quickly and feels as though it is being clenched, I start sweating, my head pounds, I feel dizzy, may struggle to walk, and my face gets really hot, etc. I think about suicide most days, every day, rather, but this certainly wasn't as bad as those years prior to 2016. This feeling low has heavily affected me in all areas of my life and I spoke to my school counselor (the first time I've sought help from a counselor or anything) a few weeks ago to which she got my into a support group on campus, so I should hopefully be getting better, but it just seems that I cannot escape this cycle of feeling terrible for several months and then happy for another few months and down again. It's weird because it had been constant sadness for the majority of my life and then it randomly began to alter. Is this abnormal? ",12Mar2019,2
20,"I don't know if this question is going to make sense.  I'm asking particularly in the context of romantic relationships, but I think this is an important thing to think about in all kinds of relationships.  Apologies if this isn't the most appropriate place to post this either.

How do you know when you're drawing too many boundaries?  Like at what point do you come to the conclusion that if you need all these boundaries the relationship just isn't working and you should let it go.

Every time I talk to someone about this I feel like I'm not getting my point across well, but I don't know how to state it better.  Like I feel like there's a certain point where you've set so many boundaries that it's turned into something that feels like ""punishing"" (again, I feel like that's not the word I want, but I can't think of a better one) the other person, or it just doesn't make sense to continue the relationship.

21,"Just for some background, im a 17F in her junior high year.  I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, but the psychologist who did so wasn’t quite reliable (Christian, church funded and basically told me to pray everything away) so I’m not quite sure about the accuracy of that.  I do see a counselor at my school now though.

(Some parts of this might fit the drumcorps subreddit better but I wasn’t sure if it was okay to kinda spew all my feelings on there, so I’m sorry about the whole corps related paragraph!)

I’ve been dealing with a lot of stuff as of late.  I auditioned for a corps drumline, got cut for not having enough chops yet and put on auxiliary 2, so the parts I play are much easier and just...not the same.

Rehearsals are emotionally draining and leave me feeling empty.  I feel like I’m not a real part of the ensemble, and like I’m not half as good of a drummer as I thought I was.  I feel really isolated from the pit too because of some negative people, but there are some great ones as well of course.  I try to make up for everything by just practicing my ass off on drums at home.
I also feel guilty for feeling  this way because I got cut, and I chose to take up that offer to play rack so I shouldn’t feel upset about anything.  But both rehearsals this weekend I just went home and cried afterwards.  I’m genuinely considering quitting but the people I’ve talked to tell me I should try and wait it out and see if things improve, or to talk to my caption head.  The idea of bringing everything up with him is terrifying though, because I feel guilty and like I’m just whining.

I’ve also been super stressed about school, band practice, and colleges.  I feel like I burden people by talking about these, so I try to just keep it to myself, but sometimes I open up and it feels like it doesn’t help at all.  I’ll talk to my boyfriend or my friends and it feels just so damn difficult to explain to them how I’m feeling because they’ll pretty much tell me to tough it out or that it’s not that bad and it just frustrates me even more to the point where I’ll just stop talking about it and try and deal with it on my own again.  I know I sound cringe, but I genuinely do feel alone even though I’m surrounded by people and like I have to handle everything by myself. ",12Mar2019,1
22," Hey everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hoping someone could give me some insights on what’s going on with me— need some advice— 

So I had this office job that i’ve been working at for a year and a half. I started to experience this weird thing from the beginning of this year and until the end of my time there (last month).

it’s starting to become really hard for me to focus and stay on task— and I feel like I don’t have the mental energy to focus on the tasks that I need to do. When I do try and focus on my tasks that I have to do on the computer— my brain starts to hurt— I feel it in my frontal cortex area and I just have to look away from my screen. It even got to a point where my brain felt like it was vibrating . it was a little scary. It’s hard to explain but I felt that if I continued to focus my brain would break. 

I thought that I was burning out and it was the job and because of my boss that I hate— so my thinking at the time was to find another job. It was not as easy as I'm making it sound but I was able to interview and  find a new job under the mental exhaustion and distress I was in. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is— now I’m at my new job and I’m starting to experience the same symptoms all over again! I felt the two weeks that I had in between these jobs were going to give me the break that I needed but I am starting to feel the same things all over again.

My brain is hurting when I focus on things, and I feel the exact same feelings of mental exhaustion . and it’s starting to hurt to focus. 

It’s also sort of affected my conversations with people as well. Like it’s hard for me to talk to someone because I can’t focus on the thread of what they are trying to say sometimes. Or sometimes I don’t get the nuances in their communication right away— like sarcasm for example. I’m still able to catch these things, but I’ve honestly felt like I’m slower overall. I don't feel on point as I used to, and I feel like I feel anxious about doing little things right. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

23,"I’ll try to be brief. My wife has begged me for 2 years to see a therapist. I finally cracked in December and have been going about 2 times a month. Its very difficult for me to open up to anyone about anything, including my wife. Things have been very slow going, I guess mostly my fault, but so far therapy has been nothing but a long series of questions with few “revelations” or whatever. 

Anyway, I went in today and got into another long series of questions. I let slip that I’m a cutter. My therapist asked to see me twice a week. She’s not charging me more so I don’t think she’s trying to scam me or anything like that. I don’t know what to do. I hate going to therapy. I find it extremely difficult, frustrating, and emasculating. The only reason I went in the first place is because my wife begged me. I’m so lost at this point I’m asking strangers on the internet for advice. What do I do? Why does she want me to go more? Am I mentally deranged and I can’t see it, or am I “broken” somehow?

24,"Im sorry if this is long but i really would like to just kill myself and be done with this life and need to see if there are any logical options that i can pull my life back together. I am a 21 year old college student majoring in graphic design. Ive dealt with depression my whole life but due to a big mental breakdown where police were called last week, ive noticed how crazy i really have become. Leading up to that event i had found my girlfriend for two years had been cheating on me which was the last thing tieing me to this world. On the early morning in question i had blacked, out went to the closest CVS to buy the highest alcohol content wine so that i could jump off a building in the city i live in. I drank a lot and dont remember much besides blasting Nirvana in my ears, crying, laughing, ranting/yelling, and updating social media of my final thoughts and words all at 3 a.m. in the lonely streets. For some reason i came back to my dorm and woke up to campus police, 50 missed calls from my mom, a crying roommate, and my very upset ex girlfriend who said i called her saying how i wanted to kill myself. Of course my mother came and got me to get me evaluated and from what i described to the psychologist sounded like schizophrenia (runs in my family but maybe a little unlikely) or major depression with psychotic features. Either with social anxiety regardless. I do have to go back in a day to get evaluated for medication and schedule private counseling sessions but im unsure i want to deal anymore.

I had scheduled a class trip to go visit a print shop and see some design studios in Nashville this weekend and i figured i would go and just take a break from school, responsibility, and conversations about my freak out. I told some of the people i was going with about my breakdown before hand and the diagnoses and they seemed okay and supportive. Little did i know that i was going to have another freak out sunday night. Im not going to lie i did have a lot of drinks so i could be myself around this group i was with but i kinda ruined the trip for everyone. After the little clique i was with tried to get rid of me at a weird club i had a big anxiety attack. Blurry vision, fast heartbeat, sweating etc. I stayed for 10 min in this club alone and i had to get out of there because i was convinced someone had given me a drug. I saw these patterns and ravens kept flying by the corner of my eyes which i now believe was me hallucinating. Now somehow i made it back to our hostel after peeing myself, falling around in the streets, and asking them if they wanted LSD in our group chat (thats what i thought i was on). I made it back BEFORE they even did and they all proceeded to get very annoyed with me in that moment. Avoiding eye contact, refusing to talk to me, etc. When they went to sleep i walked outside in the streets at 4 a.m. and sat by the river listening to Radiohead trying not to jump in the water so i could drown and stop runing everyones time. The next day i helped everyone pack up and things went back to kinda normal but i know that they know now that i am insane and not okay.

Long story short to top all this off. My major is difficult and requires a lot of time. Apart from two people in my life i dont really have people id consider close friends and im tired of always going to them to complain about my life because i can tell they are also tired. The break up fucked with me but i cant let her go because shes one of those two people. Im expected to graduate in two months and somehow i have to get my life together between now and then. Im stressed out all the time yet i have no motivation to do anything anymore. And i realized how easy it would be to just off myself before i ruin more peoples lives. I dont believe people genuinely would care that long besides my mom if i were to die. im breaking so much now idk if im living in a dream or if any of this is real. I see no other options anymore so now im here to ask i guess if this life is really worth all the pain that comes with it? Is life worth living knowing that one day we have to meet our ends?

27,"TLDR - having major anxiety/depression since starting new job. Last week, had a particularly difficult work event. Fearful about losing employment but seeking help from psychiatrist tomorrow. Hoping to hear from others with similar experiences who have words of wisdom or are open to share their treatment plans. Thx! 

Hey - have never posted before but need support. Have recently moved to a new city for my work. Husband is with me and definitely my major support. Our living situation is a little stressful because the condo we bought is new construction and delayed. We’re just living in a guest house of a friend with no laundry or kitchen and no end in sight. I’ve had a history of depression diagnosis’s but haven’t been on meds for quite some time (Zoloft and occasional Xanax was my last successful treatment.)

The new job I have is my dream job. The company is incredibly prestigious and I am making more money than I ever thought possible. I come from a pretty poor background and I still get comfort seeing extra cans of food in pantry because I know it means I’m not going to go hungry. I make in the 6 figures so you would assume this would bring me comfort. Unfortunately, it’s like the opposite is at play and I am constantly terrified of doing something wrong that would lead to me being fired. 

Since beginning new job, my depression has returned although now I think there is more to it. I have always tended to be a perfectionist (something I have strived to achieve since anything less during childhood resulted in a beating from my mom, or worse, coming home from school to find my belongings in trash bags in the driveway. The first time I had to find my own place to live, I was 12.) I feel like every time I get feedback on small items from my work partners my world crumbles. I know this isn’t “right” so I booked a psychiatrist appointment a few weeks ago (it’s tomorrow morning.) 

The days leading up to this appointment have have been some of the most difficult I’ve experienced. I had a very tough case last week that I closed with fantastic resolution (for my company) but it was a monumental lift on my part requiring lots of 12 hour days and some tough conversations along the way. 

During one of the final meetings, I cracked. I did not totally lose my composure but I welled up and tears fell from my eyes while speaking to my legal partner in front of my manager and a peer. I recovered quickly but apparently this did not sit well with those who witnessed. I should also say I shouldn’t have been on that call as I’d actually called in sick (migraine which was making me throw up) but, the nature of my work, meant time was of the essence and I needed to be on this call. All in all if I knew a coworker was going through something similar, my first inclination would have been to let a little time pass (for them to recover) and then follow up to see if they were ok. This didn’t happen and that’s ok - I was still back to normal Monday morning once the case closed. 

I was having a pretty great week where I got a bunch of praise from my partners for the “monumental lift” from the week before (had multiple cases resolve, only one that was rocky.)  On Thursday, during what I thought was my regular weekly one on one with my manager, I learned that “feedback” had been received from various partners saying I lack confidence, often pivot directions with no explanation and that I made a joke to a partner that I might “get fired” which was inappropriate. There was no detail to back these claims up and, while I would say my first few weeks might have been a little less confident, I have been pretty damn strong since (BTW, today is my 3 month with the company so I am still ramping although seems like the expectation was I would just assimilate automatically and know everything from day one.) 

I could go on forever but the short is I had 2 hours of my manager giving me this feedback but, because there was no detail, I had to answer a series of questions like “tell me about a time you weren’t confident in front of your partners.” It was incredibly demoralizing, I felt like I was being interrogated, and I’m pretty happy I didn’t drive my car right into a lamp post on the way home. At the end of the call, she casually mentions that she sought this feedback out because I cried in that meeting the week before. So, because we’re a “culture of feedback” I gave her some saying that felt a little strange and made me feel like I couldn’t be anything less than perfect in front of her going forward. She was defensive and said it was her right as a manager to seek feedback on my performance - not something I disagree with just feel like maybe a call to see if I was ok would have come before a “seeking feedback” mission. 

She followed up with two of the three partners the next day, called me, and said they had back-peddled saying nothing they shared was too egregious or had caused problems which is why they’d never addressed with me. I mean that changes everything right? I’m not even 3 months in at this point so of course there are things I can do better and, same feedback but delivered with this context, it makes much more sense. Then she preps me for another call with my legal partner who “also gave some negative feedback.” I seriously prepared for that partner to tell me they question my judgement, think I’m irrational, have absolutely no business being in my role.

So, I meet with legal partner and say “let’s debrief from last week, I heard there was some feedback for me and I want to make sure we get that out in the open.” He says he didn’t provide any feedback but went to manager to say what a good job I did getting a positive outcome for the company BUT said he knew the lift was huge and encouraged my manager to check in with me to make sure I was ok coming off of such an intense week. Said the one thing he would say is that I don’t seem to understand HOW GOOD I AM in my role (like I’m too hard on myself.) This I can get onboard with and know is part of my anxiety issues. 

Happily I go the entire weekend wondering what’s next, not sleeping, and feeing absolute hopelessness. Sunday night, around dinner time, I start to feel agitated thinking about going to work the next day. I feel faint and on the verge of passing out. Oh and I haven’t been able to eat since the feedback on Thursday (I have had something to eat because my husband is forcing it but I have absolutely no desire to eat however I am constantly needing water.) Monday comes and I contemplate driving off the bridge to avoid work. I don’t, and it’s a good thing because there is more feedback waiting for me.

Honestly, was it an ideal time to get feedback, no, but my skip level manager leveled with me and now I get it. She told me my manager was privately upset with the partners who back-peddled but did her best to support both sides (this was a bad experience for me but I understand it now and appreciate the efforts she made vs feeing like she is evil and working against me.) It still feels shitty to get feedback about my confidence levels but I understand better now that I know it was tied to the one incident from the week before (remember, it was presented to me as “in general you don’t show confidence” because she didn’t have details to share.) I can say I wasn’t totally confident with this case, it was a shitty situation, that I advised against, and it was my first “closure” at this company. There was room for learning and growing and even my legal partner said it was a tough one to “cut my teeth on.”

So, what else did I learn? Well.. apparently my legal partner DID give a bunch of negative feedback, directly to my skip level. When I told my skip level what legal partner told me in my “clear the air meeting,” she was flabbergasted. So, shit... apparently he was much more upset than he let on. And that sucks but it is so incredibly nice to hear something definitive from someone. The fact that my skip level was like “um listen, I heard this first hand and it’s not being represented to you accurately” made me feel tons better than “I have Nooo idea why you heard I had feedback.” And wondering if there is conspiracy at work behind my back.

So, I’m home now and I gave my husband the download. He agrees that today is the first helpful feedback I’ve received (at least from what I tell him) so we have a step in the right direction. Tomorrow morning is my appointment and I hope to god this doctor sees the absolute, crippling aniexty, depression, etc etc that is happening here and helps me with some meds and a plan for therapy. 

Thanks for reading. Looking for anything at this point but would love to hear from anyone who may have experienced something similar with work. Wondering, if you’re on the other side, what worked, any suggestions for me. ",12Mar2019,1
28,"So, long story short I met my best friend in a psych ward. We quickly clicked and became super close. We've been friends for around 2 years now. It was OK at first, because we were in the same boat. Super fragile and not really well enough to physically socialise with each other. As time went on, I began to recover and she has stayed in the same sort of place, maybe even worse now. That's a story in itself - I won't get into it.

&amp;#x200B;

The last six months have been hard. I have done everything in my power to try and help her. She lives about 4 hours away from me, I have spent many hours visiting and staying with her. The last 5 times we have tried to hang out she bails on me, literally in the last hours leading up to us hanging out. The worst part is they are plans we've made in advance for big events, concerts etc. She'll be texting me leading up to the event, I always say to her, you know let me know if you're not feeling up to it because there's no judgement/pressure. Bear in mind, these events have been where she lives - so I'm in the car almost there or there already 3/4 hours away from home.

&amp;#x200B;

The first few times I was really understanding, I didn't expect an apology. The fourth time I was a little mad... it was for New Years Eve and she cancelled a few days before. I ended up staying home for NYE, alone,  as all my other friends had already made plans which involved sold out tickets for events. I had offered to come up to her, and we could just hang at her house low-key but she insisted to come down to me. That sucked. The next time was for a concert we had brought tickets for back in October for February. I was literally in her city, texting and chatting about how excited we were, for her to bail on me because she was too anxious and stressed out about it a few hours before. I had booked a hotel big enough for both of us including my mum who came (she was my plan B incase my friend bailed, which luckily I had). It cost $140 more than a hotel big enough just to accomodate my mother and I - the total was $350. I booked this one specifically because it was right by where the concert was, hence it was a little more expensive, but I wanted to make it as painless as possible for her. We had booked seated tickets, so she wouldn't get anxious in the crowd (I was dying to stand because this particular band are my absolute favourite), but I was happy to compromise if it meant hanging with her. She didn't even tell me herself.. she was literally texting me 10 minutes before HER MOTHER called my mother to tell her she wouldn't be coming... bear in mind we are in our early 20s. I haven't heard from her since... no apology... nothing. The thought of attending a seated concert was too much for her, yet a month earlier she bombarded me with photos of her swimming with sharks... that was the first time I had heard from her since she had bailed on me for NYE. There's a hell of a lot more to the story and all the other times she's bailed on me, but it's too much to get into.

&amp;#x200B;

My whole dilemma is... am I being selfish and ignorant expecting a little more from a friend who's battling mental illness? Not a lot more... just a little more. I feel, and hope, I am super empathetic and sympathetic with people who have mental illnesses, but where do you draw the line? Do you let a friend treat you like a disposable piece of shit because they have a mental illness? Am I wrong to slowly abandon the friendship? Obviously, I won't be horrible... just kinda slowly fade. And lastly, how do you help someone battling mental illness who doesn't seem interested in putting the effort in to get better... is there any way? I feel like it's so wrong to abandon her over that - but I have supported her many many times, going to respite retreats with her driving the 4 hours up only for her mum to tell me she's not well enough anymore... How do you help people who don't want to help themselves? I know the simple answer is, you can't. However, I am extremely hopeful theres another way.

32,"Hi all,

This is my first reddit post so hopefully I get some help, because I need it badly.

I’m a 23 year old guy who befriended a guy who is about 7/8 years older than who worked at a movie theater with me when I was in high school, I was 18.

5 years later, I find myself in this “friendship” that has taken an unhealthy turn. 

It started out as work buddies and shooting the shit at work and nothing crazy. Growing up without a big brother he seemed to be pretty chill, hooked it up with weed and other fun stuff and showed me a lot of new things like quality movies and music. So naturally he became like a brother figure to me.

After that we stayed in contact as I went to college, he’d invite me to concerts when I was home and grabbed food to catch up, still nothing too crazy. But through this time, I always felt like he was a bit too obsessed with me. 

Today, he has been diagnosed bipolar disorder and he has begun to harass me. Throughout our friendship, I would give him advice on how to deal with certain things and essentially became a younger brother to him. 

But it has gotten very bad. In the last couple days, after he stopped talking to me for about 2 months, he reached out and wanted to talk and hangout again. I’m a full time employed guy, I have a girlfriend and I’m focusing on my own stuff now. The 2 months period that he stopped talking to me was great because I had thought he had moved on and out grown me. Unfortunately not. He repeatedly texts me saying he can’t live with out me and he needs me in his life to be sane. He has even gone to the extent of contacting my older sister and telling her everything he has felt towards me. 

She has become very concerned as have I. She has said that he is obsessed with me in an unhealthy way and even hinted that when people make the decision to stop talking to someone with bipolar, the person with bipolar tends to get suicidal. 

Now, I’ve tried not responding but he is the kind of guy that will drive to my house and show up unexpected. I am scared that if I block him completely, that will happen and I’m not sure what he is capable of. I’m fearful for my family and myself. 

I don’t know if I should reach out to his parents or what. I’m honestly lost and begging for some advice. I’m 23 years old and have dated someone with mental illness and i felt trapped then and was finally able to get out. I feel trapped again in this situation, it is not my responsibility to keep him sane, I have my own life to live. At this point I just want this whole thing to end with him. Please help if you can, anything goes a long way. 

If you need any more context please let me know, I am more than willing to tell if it means it’ll help me.

Thanks ",12Mar2019,2

35,"We are like sisters, I love her so much and we have known each other since we were babies. We are adults now (in our 20s) and living together and this is so difficult...

In the past few weeks she has been bringing up random occurrences from her past, bringing up people or occasions where she remembers people making fun of her. She starts crying when she tells me some of these things. I often see her up late at night, listening to music loudly and pacing around. She tells me stories from her childhood when her aunt came over and made fun of her, one when she once went over to her friends house and her friends mother made fun of her. I reached out to her mother and she doesn’t remember any of these things happening, so she could possibly be making them up. 

I just don’t understand why these random things from the past are putting her in so much distress right now. True or not, they all seem to be revolving around people making fun of her.

I find myself losing sleep over it, staring at the ceiling at night because I know if I go to sleep I will wake up in the morning and have to go to school and actually face it head on. I told my parents today I wasn’t feeling well so I wouldn’t have to go, but I know I have to go tomorrow. I just feel completely hopeless. I can’t do this anymore. I can’t do any of this anymore.

37,"We all crave understanding from others. We want someone else to understand how we feel, what we feel, why we feel it, our past experiences, our goals for the future, our values, morals, principles, ideas, everything about ourselves. I don't think it ever truly happens, sure we can get close, but I don't think we can ever find the understanding we so deeply crave. Most people reply to this logic with ""Come to understand yourself and find solace in it"", that's bullshit. Humans are social creatures, we feel rewarded by being social, we desire being social to some extent. For many people it becomes impossible to live in such isolation, you find understanding of yourself but then you're all alone in your understanding, how can you become content in loneliness? Few do and few desire too. 

Depression, it's a double edged sword. My depression has brought about a lot of sadness for me, feelings of failure, suicide and loss of self. My depression has also come to bring a lot of clarity about myself, who I wish to be, what my values, principles and ideas are. An endless cycle, you feel lonely and lost in your disease and your own mind, filled with ideas about the world and yourself. Many of these ideas are ultimately true. The cycle goes quite simply; Depression -&gt; Introspection -&gt; Depression. I would put a good analogy here, but those have never been my strong suit. The depression gives me the clarity to see the world around me, the blindness that people have, not just blindness to world events, blindness to themselves. 

Few people come to truly question themselves. I feel such a sense of isolation from feeling like I see that much more. From the fake social interactions, to the news, to media, and all the way to the individual. Mental illness, dare I say, comes with a gift for us all, a clarity of the world around us. We see the acts people put up, to be liked, to be polite, to maintain social prowess. It's all bullshit, all of it. Here I am, trying to describe a feeling, my views on the world, how my depression affects me. I imagine it isn't nearly as clear as it is in my head, I imagine many people will struggle to understand what I mean, my personal values leave it to the individual to find the ""truth"", ""Clarity"" and ""understanding"" I've come to find myself, it's not my place to ""enlighten"" others, ignorance is bliss and everyday I wish to go back to feeling ""normal"", ""human"" and to stop envying the people I view as blind to the realities around them.

Consider this a call for understanding from me and others like me. I'm going to write everything I've come to see in the world below and I beg anyone out there who reads this and understands what little sense it might make to respond with their own story, don't message me, I pray there are others like me out there, searching for this exact post, a post which they can relate too. I want them to know they aren't alone, no that WE aren't alone on this blue and green dot in the sky, surrounded by darkness and empty eyes, roaming the streets, shrouded in ignorance, unaware of the meaningless world around them.

This is what I've learned:

**Social situations.** 

Social situations are like watching the summer blockbusters, you know full well all the possible outcomes and where the story is going. Before I enter any social situation, I recall what I know of the person and past interactions, I don't do it consciously, I do it without even realizing it.

 I manipulate and control these situations like puppets, I use my past knowledge of this person to sway the conversation in my favor. For example, I know a friend who's really needy and tries really really hard to fit in and appeal to everyone. I saw this within the first 10 minutes of meeting him, I hadn't said anything more than ""Hi"" before I had categorized him and used my past knowledge of people like him to ensure I made a good impression. I made it seem like I went out of my way to do him a favor, I listened to him talk about cars for 20 minutes and every time he said a big number I made sure to smile and say ""Wow, that's crazy"" or something along those lines. Not the best example but one that shows the shallowness in social interactions. My mind blanks in finding good examples where I've worked to manipulate situations in my favor, I offer another underwhelming example; My friend gave me some shit for something I did, which I fully take blame for, I apologized to him, I knew he was just giving me trouble for what I did but I felt he deserved an apology none the less. He now tries quite hard to maintain my favor in our friend group, he always says stuff like, ""niny6 is my homie"" and ""come over and tell these people about this one story"", even if the story was trash. I don't particularly favor him, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed and lacks confidence in who he is. I still manipulate his emotions to make him feel better, I still say hi to him when I see him and act all happy to see him, I still give him a high five to make him feel good, I still say the stupid story to give the impression we're closer friends that we truly are. 

Do I think I'm a bad person for what I do? Not at all. I only toy with his emotions to stop him from feeling bad, to make sure that when I need something from him, I will get it. I like to think I do it for the better.

Many people have this skill of being able to read and control outcomes of social interactions without realizing it, I've seen it happen dozens of times in my short life. It's the people who know they're doing it that I'm writing this for, I want you to know that you're not alone and that others see this too.

**Principles and Values.**

I hold myself to extremely high moral principles. Without morals, what are we as humans. I try my best to make people feel happy and to give when I can. I'm going to make this simple and list my values.

Being a decent human being, giving to others, going out of your way to be nice to others, respecting others views, treating others the way you wish to be treated (To it's fullest extent), investing in relationships the same you would expect back, offering help whenever you can. I find my values are core to who I am, I will always value them above my own well being. I don't like violence, I despise it. I'm likely one of the few people you'll see willingly take the first few punches and not hit back, I view violence as beneath what people are and should be capable of. Money holds little value to me, I will willingly spend hundreds of dollars a month on my friends and family before myself, whether it be convenience for others or a gift for something someone else did for me.

 I believe that what one is given, one should return equally. If I got to ride shotgun on the way to the store, I offer the spot to the person who sat in the back, it's only fair and I why should I care where I sit? If someone buys me lunch, I offer to buy them lunch next time we're out. If I can't repay you with something equal in value, hopefully the exact same thing you gave me, I will return the favor another way, I'll run out in -40C and grab your vape from your car, run upstairs to grab a blanket for you, grab you a drink when I get up. If others don't return my small favors, I could care less, my values differ from theirs and I find solace in knowing I did something kind, regardless of it being returned. 

I value my relationships far too much, if others continually fail to invest the same amount I do in a relationship, I willingly push them away to arms length, I don't ghost them or cut them off, that's pathetic. I treat them with respect and as friends but I don't go out of my way to offer my company to them, they were given a chance to be a close friend and failed. For example, a friend of mine is horrible to our group. He never goes out of his way to meet up with us, he never offers anything to us, whether it be gifts or favors, he focuses on himself and his interests, he constantly hits on girls who are interested in us, he's a narcissist through and through. I gave him a chance to redeem his months of selfishness, I told him I'd pick him up at the train station if he wanted to hangout since he lived so far away, it was a 10 minute train ride, he refused, multiple times. 

This showed me that he didn't want to go out of his way to have my company so I refused to go out of my way to get his company. He was part of my friend group long before I joined and I very directly told our mutual friend that there was only two ways this would turn out, confront our selfish friend and give him a chance to change or ignore it and live with knowing that you didn't put forth all your effort into maintaining the friendship. 

**Introspection**

I spend a lot of my time trying to figure out why I think the way I do and how this affects. This clarity and understanding of myself, how I act and how it influences others gives me that sense of isolation mentioned at the beginning. I like to think I've found who I am but I also realize that I'm constantly changing who I am. 6 years ago I was a vastly different person than who I am, 3 years ago I was vastly different from 6 years ago and from now, 1 year ago I was even more different than who I am today. Humans are dynamic, who I am is dynamic and constantly changing and I don't know who I will be in 10 years or who I will be in 1 year. In simplistic terms, I feel different than everyone else, superior isn't the right word, ""lost"" or ""aware"" is more like it. I think the clarity and awareness I have of the world makes me different, sometimes I see it as a gift, I'm more aware of who I am, who others are, what the world is. Other times I feel lonely and lost, unsure of who I am, what I want in my future, why no one else seems to see what I see, why everyone seems so utterly ignorant to the world, they go about meaningless tasks, never talking to each other, never understanding each other, they enter relationships for good looks and shallow personalities, they seek approval from others, they make themselves look good not for themselves but for others, they care so deeply about what others think of them that they let life pass them by. 

Even more scary, I've come to try to understand regret, how life's ultimate goals are regret and death. No matter how we live out lives, we'll always have regret. No matter how nice I act, how kind I am, the actions I take and don't, I will always come to regret them. Ask that girl out and get rejected, at least you won't regret not doing it, except you'll come to regret having done it, having been placed in such an embarrassing situation, having been vulnerable and being brushed off for it. Go on that trip to Europe that you've always wanted to do, you come to regret not being at home with your friends and the experiences you could've had, you come to regret not being at work and missing that opportunity to get promoted or make a good impression, you regret stuff that could have or couldn't have happened. You can never truly know. Each decision you make is one with regret, buying the black coffee instead of the one with milk, not going to class that day and coming to regret not going but if you had gone you would've come to regret going, seeing how much time you feel was wasted. Life is regret, you can't escape it, you can't come to accept it, accepting decisions is a falsehood. How can you accept a decision when you can never come to understand where that path could've taken you. The solution to regret isn't accepting it, it's coping with it and understanding how each decision you make is one you'll come to regret at some point, the feeling doesn't go away, it's overridden and forgotten until it comes back with a different decision.

Death is the light at the end of the tunnel of life. As cheesy and over explored the idea of death as life's ultimate goal is, it's true. We are all working towards death. There will be a time after your death when a friend has one final memory of you, one last thought about who you were, what you did together and then you'll be forgotten for who you were, nothing more than a photo in an album. Your great grandparents had that moment, a friend thought about them, the life they lived, the experiences they had and then suddenly, they were lost to time. A final thought for the dead, only to be lived on in photos and stories, never known for who they truly were, what they believed, how they acted, the way they talked, those car rides they loved so dearly and told so few, lost behind videos and images of when they were at their best or times they barely remembered. I recently read that people on their death beds come to regret not living true to themselves, can we ever truly live true to ourselves? The world doesn't work that way. You need to go to school, get a good job, find love, have kids, go on vacations, celebrate holidays, you do all this to find that ""true self"" and many come to believe that this is it. I imagine that on these people's deathbeds they come to regret not doing something differently, what would've happened if they ignored it all, ran away in high school and lived a life somewhere else.

 I guess the question is: What is living your life to your true self and is it ever attainable? Or are we just doomed to regret our lives no matter what we do? Doomed to be forgotten to time, lost to death regretful of all the decisions we made in our lives?

One might wonder why I wrote this on a mental health subreddit, I think it's as I stated in the beginning; Mental illness gives one a sense of understanding, clarity and introspection that many people never find themselves. I suffer from anxiety and depression, many days I don't feel it, mainly because many days the depression has me void inside, feeling nothing and seeing nothing. Many days I do feel it, it lingers as sadness and loneliness, a time to come to understand why the world has fucked us all so bad, why we were blessed with the absolutely wonderful gift of mental illness.

I speak out to the void of the internet; if anyone feels this way, write it below, help that lonely soul out there who feels the way you and I do. Help us find solace in knowing we're not alone and that some shared experience might bring a connection. If only I could yell this out in person, if only I could say something in person to each and everyone on this blue speck and get to know each of you for the person you are beyond the persona you put on for the world. I feel a sense of sorrow for all us, we're all doomed to never be truly understood. I offer an opportunity for the reader of this to take the sense of understanding I'm offering, the chance for you to know that I understand each and every aspect of you and all I ask for in return is to try to understand me and offer me the same comfort I hope to offer you, one of reaching that deeper understanding we all crave.",12Mar2019,1

My intrusive thoughts insist that I have cheated on my husband (we were together for 4 years and got married 2 months ago). I know I haven't cheated but for the past 2 months, my OCD has been convincing me otherwise.  I'm doing awful and quite frankly I don't want to get cognitive behavioral therapy or go on medication because in the past, I went for therapy for 3 years and took meds and it never helped. I want to go for a new kind of solution. I want to get some kind of solution that will erase these thoughts I'm having. I know select memory/thought erasure isn't possible... but is there any kind of therapy to help me forget that I've ever had cheating OCD? I want these thoughts out of my head for good and gradually forget they were ever there. Can a therapist do that for me? I've also heard of ECT but it sounds way too extreme. Any similar solutions?

44,"Most recently, a very subtle fear I had of driving over and under bridges has gotten out of hand. I work 20 minutes away and I leave more than an hour sooner than I should to take an extremely long route so I only have to go over one bridge. And even thinking of driving over that bridge makes me tense up and hyperventilate. And there's tons of other things that make my life much harder and I'm constantly on edge. 
I can't leave the house after dark by myself, even to run to the corner store. Now convincing myself to leave the house at all is a struggle. I'm worried it will make me agoraphobic. I cant even look at a picture of the ocean or anything underwater, I hyperventilate, I used to be able to swim in lakes (never the ocean), then my anxiety ruined that, but I could still go into pools, but now that's even too much for me. Underwater documentaries freak me out and I can't even play some of the games I loved because even swimming in a video game makes me hyperventilate and tense up. I can't have a normal conversation with the person at the cash register like I used to. Or anyone I don't know. I'm always wondering what they want from me or what they're trying to take from me. I used to be able to reason with myself and call myself out when my fear and anxiety would take over but I can't even talk myself down anymore. I physically can't make myself do these things. I will literally start shaking and freeze. I've done it in front of strangers and it is mortifying and embarrassing, which ruins me for a few days and leaving the house is an even bigger struggle again because what if I leave and it happens again?
 It's gotten so bad I'm thinking of just ending my life in a real way. Why live when you can't even ""live""
I can't visit any doctors about this because I can't afford insurance or any of the meds they'll probably try to subscribe to me. I'm hoping someone has some advice or ways to bring myself back because I'm not even me anymore. ",12Mar2019,5

I went through pain, emotional and physical, that I thought would be the end of me. I had hallucinations, I went blind, I broke bones and I missed my entire highschool experience. I gained weight, went on anti-psychotics, I attempted suicide. I have no formal qualifications for anything and yet my future is bright. 

No matter what you’re going through now, I believe you can find your way and make it work. The suffering builds you as a person and I wouldn’t change who I am or what I’ve went through.

Only recently got a job. I work mainly with the public. It's stressful and I mostly deal with upset customers. I have to just stand there and smile while I get verbally abused and there's not much I can do about it.

I'm mentally exhausted and super stressed. Apart from my own work, my manager and supervisors just pile on constantly. 

At work I mainly try to just repress the feelings, which is probably not healthy. I haven't eaten in 2 days, I do have lunch breaks at work, which I just don't take as I have a ton of stuff to do and I feel like I'm letting down the public I'm supposed to be assisting when I do take a break, I get home at 5/6pm, I feed the dog, then just go to bed. 

I feel like I need a break, but I cannot relax. Hobbies I love (training dogs for example) is just a chore at this point. 

I almost cried at work yesterday. I feel like I cannot handle things anymore. I'm overwhelmed. 

I'm ashamed to say that, yesterday, after what felt like my millionth angry customer, I wanted to go lock myself in the bathroom and self harm, which I haven't done in months.

51,"sorry for the formatting, I'm on mobile.
This is a long post so sorry in advance and thank you for reading.

Some info to give context, I am currently 19 and I am trans mtf and open about it to my family and friends (who are all very supportive). A few years ago before I came out to people, I was dating this girl that I was head over heels for. She was my everything and I wanted to spend my life with her, I was young and blinded by love, I didn't see all the red flags until afterword. 

Our relationship started out alright, we became good friends before we started dating, however once we started dating things started to go bad. It was like every other week she had some new person that she claimed was ""trying to take her away"" from me, and she would demand that I do what she wanted or else she would go with them. being the dumb and love sick kid I was, I would listen to her. I had to respond to all her messages immediately, I was never allowed to say no or to argue with her, I was not allowed to interrupt her when she was with friends, I was not allowed to make plans  with friendsbecause she might need me for something, etc etc. We dated three years and as I was learning more about myself I came to her and told her that I think I might be transgender. She did not like that, she got very angry with me and told me that if I am trans then I can never be with her, she then kept making threats to leave me for someone else so I took back what I said. finally I had enough one day and broke it off with her after some family members died.

fast forward a few years and I have come out to people and I have started dating my current boyfriend. He is really sweet and caring, but he has commented recently on my behavior that makes me worry. He talkes to me about how it seems like I'm afraid to say no to him and that whenever he messages me I drop whatever I'm doing to message back. He is worried about my mental health and he asks me all the time if I'm ok. I always say yes even when something is wrong. He knows a little about my ex but not everything and I think it might be hurting our relationship. I don't know what to do.",12Mar2019,1

53,"I know they're not, but I always keep thinking, what if? And that has been there for years together. It has affected me in such subtle but deep ways and I've just come to realise how often I do it. It might seem like nothing, but it changes the way I am, even when I'm completely alone. I think I should act a certain way and do certain things that wouldn't make me look stupid. In addition, I have this unhealthy obsession with being perceived as 'cool'. The thought of not being cool is always bothering me and I always second guess my thought and what I just said. So all of this combined, I feel like I've lost the ability to just be myself. I change around stuff even in my journal just because I think it's not cool. Basically 'what if someone reads it' thought is always hovering over my head. It is my journal, who tf is going to read it anyway? The rational part in my brain always checks in and reassures me that I'm being dumb but I am not able to help it. 

It feels almost freeing to say this because it's been hidden inside my head for so long even from myself. And I would just like to know if it's normal or not, because if it is, I can stop worrying and if it's not, what can I even do to help it",12Mar2019,1
54,"I'll try to make this as short as I can.  

If you're trigger by cheating in relationships, do not read this.  I deal with this guilt already.  I'm looking for help, not for hatred.

Basically, I feel comfortable getting into relationships that have the potential to last a long time.  I don't ever feel afraid of long-term relationships, at least I don't think so :)

BUT...

In every single one of my relationships, I have completely stopped having sex with them after about 3 months.  Sometimes, even less time than that.  

I couldn't and still can't quite figure out why.  One huge problem is that I DO want to have sex but with other people.  I have always felt awful because I just stop seeing my SO as someone I want to have sex with.  But I certainly don't feel ""in love"" with other people that I have had sex with just to get off.

After some time, I started to realize that, the more I felt closer and comfortable with my partner, the more I cared for and fell in love with them, the less I felt sexually attracted.  It's as if my brain does NOT want sex associated with someone I love, which isn't how it should be.  And while my partners have varied in their reactions -- from ""You don't love me"" to just not approaching me for sex anymore and just carrying on as normal -- they nearly always decide to stay because we still have care about each other.  One of them left because he developed a sexual attraction for someone else, but once that faded for him, he still called me and told me how much he missed me... despite the fact that our relationship was pretty much sexless.

I'm sorry if this is confusing or nonsensical, but I've never really been able to share it with many people.  I try talking about it with some friends, but they have never experienced this.  It obviously interferes with my life because I'm at worst a cheater.

Has anyone else had this problem?  Is this common?  Is it some sort of psychological issue?  How do I fix it?  It's not as easy as...""You need to make the effort to initiate sex"" because my feeling just isn't there.

55,"I've never had the chance to love anyone, and i'm the type of person who feels like they were put on the planet to love someone. 

I'm gay and was in a severely abusive het relationship, so I dont count it. But that some how makes the loneliness worse. I havent been with a girl yet and for the past year and a half, not a day goes by where I dont spend at least 2 hours of the day thinking about how lonely I am and how much I want company. You'd think I'd stop thinking about this every day by now, but I have not. You'd think I'd be able to go a couple weeks concerned over other things- even just a day- but I cannot. Though it gets a teeny tiny bit better as the months pass, it is still a concious thought in my mind that I cannot let go.

I feel like every moment I am not loving someone is a moment I am wasting. And I cant shake the feeling of impending doom that tells me I will be sad and lonely forever. I mainly just want to be allowed to focus my loving energy on someone because that is when I'm the happiest, but I feel as though no one will allow me.

I liked one girl for a while and sent her some poetry and all the sappy shit. She appreciated it but was not interested in me and throughout her rejection, she was telling me ""I am not as whimsical as you see me."" Though I acknowledge her humanity and know she is HUMAN with flaws, am I not allowed to appreciate someones existence that way? Is it wrong of me to love that hard? Why am I not allowed to love someones existence? Why is it so wrong? Also poetry is whimsical and that's just my style of poetry, really. Anything i write about is whimsical. It just hurt so much because I put so much love into it, and my love was wrong.

When I was in an abusive relationship, I wrote him a poem that was mainly an apology for being a bad person to him. In reality, I was being abused and gaslighted. When I went to bring him the poem, he rolled his eyes and got angry at me and refused to read anything I wrote him. That hurt because I put thought and feeling into something but the love was lacking and the person was just an asshole.

But THIS? I worked up so much courage to bury my fears and allow myself to love again, and then i'm told I am not allowed to love that way. And I dont know how to feel other than sadness and self loathing.

It just made the impending doom of loneliness so much worse and all I see are years of me wanting to love and not being allowed to, and it scares me so much. I feel like i'm such a bad, delusional person for appreciating the existence of someone as much as I do. I feel like it's just messed up or something and I hate myself so much.

So my friend struggles with depression. This has been the case for the past few years. Recently they've gotten much worse. It could be because our latest project was due in last week but I don't want to jump to conclusions. We're also starting a new project which basically involves speaking to strangers, something she's really not comfortable with.

They've had a suicide attempt before, they've been in counseling but no longer are as it didn't help. They're on antidepressants atm. I've offered to speak to someone at college for them or contact one of the many mental health services for them, but they didn't want to and of course I shouldn't force them to.

Last week was particularly bad. We're in college Monday to wednesday only. Tuesday and Wednesday she ended up just completely blanking out. She wasn't in yesterday and probably won't be in today. If she's missing this much time it would be important to tell someond, as getting under 90% attendance stops us going through to the next year. She's also spoke about wanting to just ""give up"" I don't know what to do in situations like these. I want to help but if I push her I know it will just make things worse. If I speak to someone I know she won't be happy about it. It just makes me feel completely useless in situations like this.

63,"Hey, 

sorry about anything that might be ignorant in this post I don't know much about what is happening and want to know what would help, 

&amp;#x200B;

This person has been struggling for a long time and they have been getting better (seemingly) for a long time. This is a younger sibling, and has learned that, through going to therapy, most of their pent up anxiety and anger is against me. I was a 3 sport athlete that was honor roll and earned an athletic scholarship in the same high school as them and in a very athletic/ academic driven family. I followed an older sibling who earned academic  scholarship and went to Ivy League while also being an athlete in high school. We have one more very young sibling who is the last person in the house. (this is all background sorry if it doesn't help but the concerned sibling is the 3rd child in the family of 4)

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't really always gotten along with this sibling. They would consistently not do homework and nor turning in assignments and quit sports in the later years of high school which lead to stress with our parents but while also testing high in standardized tests along with the SAT. They almost didn't apply/go to college and once they decided to go it was a great relief to the entire family even though they would have found work without school because they are smart enough.  We have always fought with it ending with the the sibling attacking me with really insensitive comments that go in every category of insult. I have always just laughed at them and insulted back because I can't just fight them like I would a person at the bar or in the street. They are family so I could never hurt them. This went away with very personal conversations about my own demons once I left for college and would regularly continue almost always, with certain exceptions/ outbursts/ fights like childhood, it was pretty solid at home and with the relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

So after them going to therapy over anxiety issues and several years of me being in college and them being a first year there was just another scary explosion. This is one that started over a videogame where we were trash talking one another (which we have always done, and usually they win). It turned into more once I said ""you are arguing like Trump does"" (because from my perspective he was just talking over me and ignoring whatever I was saying but he took offense because in our liberal town that would be considered a very deep insult \[our parents are very republican and he might be also\]).  This lead to the regular fights that we had when we were younger;  he called me fat (I struggle with my weight), calls me a drug addict that will die in 10 years (because of my weed usage in the past), tells me I peaked in high school, sexual activity, etc. Either way, he was saying this to me in the late hours of the night while a room away and a family sleeping. I felt that we needed to talk about it face to face, but it only made things far worse because I would continue argue my point (which I shouldn't of done in retrospect of how he reacted) and he would get angrier and angrier. That is when he would start telling me to commit suicide and how I will die soon anyway and how I am a waste of a human and further devastating things to hear from a sibling. Im not going to sit here and say  that  this was his fault because it wasn't, there was an argument that I probably made worse and and i've learned that our relationship growing up has caused some of his issues. I can't change these things that happened in the past even though I wish I could, but I really don't know how we can move on with him almost violently exploding on me. I have been thinking of not returning home anymore and just moving in with friends instead of coming home on break or just staying at school instead of coming home at all. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just want help from this community to understand what is happening with my sibling and try and learn what they are going through. I know I will never actually understand what is happening, but if I can learn was to help them and even myself be comfortable around each other after this recent fight that would possibly help save this relationship and also my family. Any advice would be appreciated or comments on what I should or should not do moving forward.

64,"I can’t really find a place to vent and it seemed like a good idea to put it in here and possibly give some advise to inpatients and others who aren’t treated properly

(My mental health has improved a lot since I was last in hospital so that’s a good thing atleast idk)

So a few months ago I was admitted into a local hospital for I think the fourth or fifth time. Keep in mind that this was a children’s hospital, with colourful things, game stations and even a whole floor dedicated to having fun. 

So the entire vibe of the hospital is okay, the colours and children are kind of overwhelming but I can deal with it on my way up to the top floor. Not only is this floor packed up to the top, essentially shoving us up out of sight and out of mind. 

So after I’m admitted I settle into a room and unpack my things. I say goodbye to my mum and try to have a nap as I was extremely exhausted. A nurse a few minutes later is banging on my door telling me to come “socialise” and “stop being moody”

Big red flags here, I haven’t ever had a nurse tell my depressed little sad bean self thins like that. I had previously spoken to nurses about this and that if I couldn’t come out that it was ok and they wouldn’t push it 

So eventually I get up, sobbing because I’m a bit of a wreck and the same nurse tells me I’m behaving worse than her 6 year old (wtf)?


(Thought I’d mention that the same nurse last time I was there have my roommate my medication by accident. I take 150mg of quetipine, the regular dose for others there was 12.5mg. Needless to say when I was given my right meds I couldn’t sleep because I was afraid she would die from an overdose)



Fast forward to the next morning and I’m feeling just as horrible, and the nurse came in twice to tell me breakfast was there. I couldn’t even think straight and just couldn’t reply to her.

I wrapped the blankets over my head and she literally tried ripping it off me, after tugging for a while I let the blanket go and just layed there having a full on panic attack

We had phones in the nurses station that we could use to call our parents so I asked for the phone. Instead of bringing one for me she literally makes me come to the nurses station or she’s refuse.

After calming down I went to get the phone and called my mum, I was sobbing again and I ran to my room. She was two hours away but legit drove all the way to come and see me and we had a full on meeting with the nurse with her and my brother and I ended up getting aggressive and lashing out at her (I had to be moved to a new pod with more “high risk” patients)

Idek what to say I’m just so angry that she treated me like that and is treating other kids the same way today. Please don’t take people’s bs and just nail down ur blankets my dudes",12Mar2019,1

66,"So it first started when I was very young, because my neck was the place that most tickled me. My friends knew that I wasn't responding to their tickles in any body part except my neck so they would always target my neck when they want to annoy me.

Anyway, gradually, my neck has become more and more sensitive. I always feel the urge to pull the fabric of the top I'm wearing to cover it, and/or to surround it with my hand so that it is totally covered. I first need to note that I'm wearing a headscarf (hijab) which normally covers the neck so when I'm outdoors it is fine  because my neck is not exposed. But when my  headscarf is off indoors is when the problem shows. This urge increases specially in three cases: 
1- When there are people around. So if I'm alone like taking a shower or something, most of the time I'm not annoyed (unless cases no. 2 or 3 happen). So it mostly annoys me when there are people around me.
2- When my hands are busy. So if I'm washing the dishes or cooking or anything that makes my hand busy, the urge increases. And I can't resist it and just use my dirty/wet hands to pull my top to cover it multiple times during my cooking/washing.
3- When I think/talk about my neck. Like the whole time I'm writing this post, I'm more conscious about the existence of my neck and my need to protect/cover it. Also if I see a picture of a spider or an insect for example, as an unconscious reflex I just cover my neck with my hands because I guess I imagine it attacking my neck or crawling on it.

Any time I have been to a hairdresser or so on, and I take off my hijab, I use it as a neck scarf to cover my neck so that I can act normally. I also remember an incident that happened about a year ago. I was with my friends at a friend's house so my headscarf was off, and then a friend was about to tickle my neck and as a reflex I punched her in the face. She was shocked, and me too actually because I didn't realize it until I hit her.

So anyway, I just want to know if that counts as an OCD, and if someone has something similar because I searched but in vain. I also want to know how such OCDs are normally treated.

But how am I going to get through the rest of this year?

I’m applying to new schools for sure because I am hesitant about even staying in education, but I’ve only ever worked at my current school so I feel like I need to try another setting before completely giving up on it. I’m just tired, drained, discouraged, and overly sad and anxious because of my job. I still have to stick it out for at least 3 more months. Maybe more if I don’t find a job in another school. 

Those of you with anxiety and depression, how do you get by when it’s at its worst? How do you even get up in the morning to go to a job that makes you physically ill? ",12Mar2019,1
68,"Starting at a very young age my brother bullied me excessively, and is a very manipulative person. Because of this, I grew up hating myself resulting in all kinds of self image problems and other various issues as I entered my teens. All of these went untreated, but I feel I just ultimately treated the issues on my own. Im 21 with a good head on my shoulders, but cant seem to shake the feeling that maybe I should look into therapy now while these memories seem to be weighing me. 

How do you know when its actually time to go to therapy? Or will I just get over this feeling of all my issues nagging at me at once? I’ve never had a single thought of going to therapy over any of my issues separately until recently, as they're all resurfacing at once. I feel at a loss and cant figure out why so many past experiences are bothering me all over again. Has anyone else experienced this?

There are upwards of a dozen reasons that I think I need professional help, but the reasons vary wildly in *type* of problem and severity.

71,"Just wanted to share my story. I’m so happy because i already see lots of improvement!!

I have been suffering from bad panic attacks for years now. They happen when i have a big fight with my partner. I feel powerless and locked up, and this feeling is so strong it drives me towards a panic attack where i hyperventilate, shake, get really dizzy and sometimes pass out.

Since a while i’m seeing a therapist, mainly because i had my second (unexpected) surgery on cancer in my spinal canal with some complications i have to deal with. But during the therapy the subject of my panic attacks came up. 

With help from my therapist i realized that my panic attacks are a result of unprocessed trauma. My first panic attack ever was when my ex was physically and mentally abusing me and he locked me up after beating me up and yelling and manipulating me. I have always been ashamed for this abuse, so i haven’t told many people. 

Since i realized where my panic comes from, i am able to deal with this much better than before. I told my partner about it and he was very supportive. I had been keeping the complete truth for him for a long time, but i told him. This puts everything more in perspective for him, too. 

Last week we had a big fight where i felt powerless and locked up, and i felt the panic rushing into my body and mind. I quickly realized that this was happening and told myself ‘this is not the same situation. I am not locked up, no one is going to hurt me now. I am free.’ By telling myself this, i was able to calm down a lot. I’m so happy with this improvement and very hopeful that my panic attacks will disappear for good! 

Tl:dr: have been suffering from panic attacks for years, finally found the cause and now working through this. Seeing improvement so quickly and i’m very happy about it!",12Mar2019,6

The term STD or [Sexually Transmitted Disease](https://www.drroysclinic.com/disease-details/sexually-transmitted-disesase) refers to a medical condition that passed from one person to another person through any kind of sexual contact. You can be affected by STD via having an unprotected vaginal, anal or oral sex with someone who has the STD.

STD is also known as Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) or Venereal Disease (VD).

It is not always necessary that STD will be transmitted via sexual contact. In this era many children are affected by STD. It can be transferred via breastfeeding and sharing same needle.

We are sharing the symptoms &amp; types of STD in men and women specifically in this article. Have a look! ([Click to know more](https://www.drroysclinic.com/blog-details/everything-you-should-know-about-common-symptoms-types-of-std))",12Mar2019,1
73,"It's started happening a lot recently. I look at my hand and I can see it but my brain tells me my hand is a bit to the right of where I see it. My vision gets blurred and it feels like my whole body is shifted to the right from where it actually is. If I'm holding my phone I feel like I wouldn't be able to put it up to my ear for example, because the phone is not in my hand and my head is not where my head is, but I haven't tried. It's hard to explain. It's very scary when it happens. It lasts for maybe a minute at a time. What is this?

When I move my hand it feels very weird, the hand I see is not ""my hand"", it's like my real hand is invisible and the hand that I can see is only mimicking my movement.  
There are other things that has been going on too but I'm not sure if they are connected. I hear a dog or a cat, or some animal of some sort running around the house every night but the house is empty, I live alone and I don't have animals. Sometimes I hear loud banging on doors but there's no one there.

TLDR: does anyone have any experience with HPD and know the best course for diagnosis?

Some MH context: I'm 22, I am diagnosed with depression, anxiety and emotional dysregulation but have always felt like something is not quite right with my diagnoses. A few months ago I was researching BPD so I could understand my friend's mental illness a little more, and stumbled upon histrionic personality disorder (HPD). And I fit every.single.description.

I would honestly kill myself over a lack of attention and people thinking negatively of me. I lie and exaggerate all the time if I think it's going to make people like me more (plot twist: it doesn't). I use both physical and mental illnesses to get attention from others, often talking about them in huge levels of detail to make people feel sorry for me. That's a big thing too, oversharing every single detail of my life to anyone and everyone. It's like, letting people into my life makes me feel like I have lots of people who love and support me. I'm addicted to weed (ya it's truly possible), initially starting as a coping mechanism for my anxiety but now I could smoke a q in a week and not even blink. My eating habits are non existent and I've dropped 15 pounds in the last few months simply from not eating. You can now see my ribs and instead of being concerned I cannot wait to show this off. I sleep around a lot, even if I'm in a relationship, have had an STI and more than 10 failed relationships. I've lost countless friends and my relationship with my family - especially my mother who definitely has undiagnosed something - is so strained. I get very easily bored and distracted and often get in trouble for doing just straight up dumb shit. I simultaneously feel completely and utterly worthless (thank u depression) while also thinking I am straight up the greatest human on the planet. I think I'm dumb hot and just assume that most people want to have sex with me, but then my crippling self doubt kicks in and I'm so fat and gross that I can't even believe my boyfriend loves me. I consider myself to be the smartest person I know and am intimidated by people who are smarter than me. I demand the centre of attention in public and private, and have had to teach myself how to engage in normal conversation that isn't all about me.

This is so long, classic me, but I would just appreciate it if anyone had any similar thoughts/feelings/experiences. Or maybe you know/are someone with HPD who can offer some advice or tell me that I'm just crazy.

78,"So long story shot, I have been battling depression and anxiety for a little over 3 years and OCD for about 10 or 11 years. And now I'm just running out of steam. I have been seeing a few therapists over the past 2 years and feel like I'm not making any progress on that front. I feel like my life is falling apart and got no reason to continue, yes I'm aware that it's not the answer what so ever I'm just very tired of being the person who is always in the wrong, getting made fun on, getting screwed over and getting told that I'm ugly. I am aware that good stuff happens to me like getting a 83% in college or having a nice car. But in the inside I'm withering away. This feeling was becoming very prevalent about 2 years ago when my dog passed. I was devastated as she was in my life for my entire childhood into my mid teens. It seemed like everyone had someone to comfort them and my Girlfriend (at the time) refused to come and see me because she couldn't understand what to do. About 2 weeks later we made plans to hangout after she was done work, she finished at 11pm and we spending the night and we were going to leave in the morning. Well turns out she was invited to a party after work and she decided to ditch me without letting me know. So at 12am I was getting worried as I didn't hear from here. 1am rolls around nothing 2am nothing.. finally at 3am I get ahold of her and she explains that I'm never there for here and she will be at my place at 4am just to wait for her. So at this point I'm beyond upset, but still waited (for some reason ) around 5am I call her again... she says she is going to crash at the guys house who was hosting the party. At this point I was way beyond pissed that after all this time I was waiting it was just a big fuck you. And it didn't help that we were supposed to leave at 7am. I decided to go by myself and she came and got her stuff from my place and broke up with me about three days after through a text while I was at work. But it didn't end there. About once a week she would contact me explaining that I was the only one for her and she wanted me back. This caused even more stress for me as I just wanted to get things back on track. We have been broken up for about 2 years and she finally stop texting me about 3 months ago. Not to long after this my friend was looking for a car. Now I should mention that I'm in the Automotive industry and I fix cars for a living. So they asked me to inspect a car for them. I took time off work to help them out and the only thing they had to say was. I couldn't get ahold of my other friend so you'll do. About 6 months later the car started showing issues that were not present at the time and now it's my fault because... it is I guess. Flash forward 1 year later I was getting ready for college. Things were starting to go well I was feeling good and ready to get things started.  Well in college alot of people would go out their way to point of my appearance, and not in a good way. You can bet this took its toll on me and by the time college was done I was a wreck. Right after college I had to go back to work to get more on the job training.  And I have been treated like shit by one  of the counter persons calling me a ""low level person"" or a ""unpolished mess"" now I'm just feeling like complete and utter garbage. And just a few nights ago I got into a confrontation with my friend. He has been consistently making fun of my appearance every chance he gets. At first it was funny then it just got annoying. I have asked him a few times to stop but it just doesn't seem to help. Now I should have responded in a better way than what I did rather than provoking the fight. Should have been an adult about it, but I just cant think anymore. I feel lost, confused, angry, tired, ugly, lonely and a fuck ton of other emotions. Like I said in the start I have been seeing a therapist also on anti depressants. My parents and grandparents have been nothing but supportive but they have a bit of a hard time to understand what's going on and I can't blame them whatsoever. I don't know any more just really stressed. Well if you made it this far congratulations. Thanks for reading ",12Mar2019,2

84,"I'm currently 15 female.

Before I get into this, I'd struggled with suicidal thoughts, self harm, attempts of suicide, and prolonged sadness and gloominess for around 8 years before this situation. It had dialed down for a year or so before this as well. ""ended"" at the start of 2017 (January).

Sorry this is long. 

Last year from April to late July/Early August I was extremely extroverted and energized. I was frequently inspired, taking initiative, didn't need more than 2 hours of sleep a night to still be energized, felt like I was on top of the world all the time, honestly.. I felt like the world was amazing and beautiful and I simply was just incredibly happy. 

There were rare random weeks during these euphoric months that I felt utterly empty and constantly sad though, but then it'd be away and I'd be back to feeling like I was high, almost, and I'd be really hyper, etc. I liked who I was back then, nonetheless. I loved socializing and I would drop everything I was doing to run upstairs and call my friend(s), etc. It was amazing to say the least (excluding my down weeks but the up weeks made up for it and overall I felt super happy). 

Before April, I had been overcoming a wave of despair. It started in mid-to-late November of 2017 and I was constantly tired, sleeping 10-12 hours over the weekend, but during the weekdays I usually could not get more than 2 hours of sleep a night as I'd wake up in increments of 10-30 minutes after falling asleep and take a while to fall asleep (only to wake up soon after as I described). I wore the same clothes to school everyday and spent most of my day pulling my hair out, which, along with my face and the rest of my body, was very much greasy and my hair releasing a musty smell, even I could tell, but my peers often pointed it out. I didn't have enough energy to really do anything. I probably didn't shower for a few months, or several weeks. I didn't try in school so my grades were not up to their potential (had all A's and one B though). I cried nearly every night and would rest my head on my desk or close my eyes on the bus rides to and from school.

Once April 2018 came around, I began to experience that energized happiness I previously described. In August of 2018, it went away and it only worsened as each day went by. At this point in time, I've become more introverted and prefer to finish a YouTube video over talking to a friend immediately. I feel as though I've lost myself and who I was. I feel tired most of the time and have been doing horribly in school, bouncing between Cs and Bs in a couple of classes as I cannot get myself to do any work, or I will procrastinate and lead to myself receiving an hour or so of sleep from working on an assignment too late. I used to start projects the second I got home.. I've also been experiencing what I believe to be anxiety but I'm not entirely sure because I've never endured such things before and I'm not trying to self-diagnose anything but I panic often. This happened today, too, simply because I am supposed to engage in a group call tomorrow morning (which was my idea, so it's stupid of me to be panicking) but anyway, when I start to panic (some worse than others, my first panic being in October) I cannot breathe/struggle to breathe, my chest pounds quickly and feels as though it is being clenched, I start sweating, my head pounds, I feel dizzy, may struggle to walk, and my face gets really hot, etc. I think about suicide most days, every day, rather, but this certainly wasn't as bad as those years prior to 2016. 

This feeling low has heavily affected me in all areas of my life and I spoke to my school counselor (the first time I've sought help from a counselor or anything) a few weeks ago to which she got my into a support group on campus, so I should hopefully be getting better, but it just seems that I cannot escape this cycle of feeling terrible for several months and then happy for another few months and down again. It's weird because it had been constant sadness for the majority of my life and then it randomly began to alter. 

I miss the person I used to be so much. It tears me apart and I feel worse simply thinking about who I was. I've lost myself.

92,"Hi everyone. 

So I’m not sure why I’m writing this post. I think I’m looking for advice.

Currently, I’m struggling mentally. A lot. My mental health has never been great but I think up until the past year I was in denial about it, or at least thought it was normal so just got on with things as best as I could. 
Over the past few months, I think I’ve spiralled into depression. I have no motivation to do anything, I’m behind at lectures, failed to hand in my assignments, even just getting out of bed is a serious struggle. My sleeping and eating patterns are irregular. 

I put on, what I can only describe, a show to everyone around me that I’m fine and come across as a happy, bubbly person. Even this drains me mentally which in return means that when I’m alone with my boyfriend (he’s aware of  how my mental health is) I’m irritated, shut in and confrontational. This leaves him feeling confused and annoyed that I’m communicate fine with others but when it’s just us two, a lot of the interactions are negative. We live with 4 girls and although 3 of them are okay, the 4th is very manipulative and a leader and can passive aggressively ostracise you if you don’t behave how they like (they made a separate group chat for the house that I’m not in, which is used to discuss things I do &amp; make plans without me)  . As they have a much better relationship with the other housemates, to speak out would probably result in everyone distancing themselves further. 

I’ve suffered with drug and alcohol abuse since I was 15. Most weekends up till now I regularly get black out drunk where I remember very little of the night, behave seriously out of character and feel shame and embarrassment for days after. But as at university I’m surrounded by drinking behaviour and I do it enjoy it so it’s hard to refrain from getting involved. 

When it comes to life in general I feel almost bored of it. Nothing excites me anymore and I don’t have any realistic goals or aims that I want to work for and would be settled with. So I just feel trapped, with life continuously moving forward and I’m going nowhere. 

I had some traumatic things happen to me when I was younger that I never told anyone or dealt properly with but I’m not sure if that would make me feel like this now and so lifeless. 

Thanks anyone who read this and any responses or advice would be great. 
Hope everyone is having a good day",12Mar2019,4

This subreddit definitely deserves more attention and if anyone here has suggestions where else to turn, please let me know. 

Onto the issue at hand.
I have this close bunch of mates. We went through high school together and 10 years on, we are still close, despite not being able to see each other nearly as often. Some moved for work, some studying, some married with kids. Some single. Some shift workers some 9-5ers. 
Diverse bunch. 

One of these mates, seems to be going through a perpetually hard time. And we are at the end of our rope trying to work out how to look after him. 

It got worse over a year ago. He went through a break up with a girl he had been dating for 6 months. We recently had a get together as one of the guys who had moved away was visiting. In the space of an evening, he brought up this girl 17 times! Completely unprompted. They dated for 6 months over a year ago. Immediately after the breakup we made sure we saw him lots. But it wasn’t sustainable over a long term. We have lives to live. 

[some side context: this girl is the best friend of one of the crew’s roommate. We get along with the roommate and the girl but make sure not to not have her around when there is the chance of him being there]

He accuses us of being bad friends. 
That he doesn’t feel like part of the group. That we are excluding him. Which isn’t true at all. All catch ups are organised through a communal  FB chat. Nearly constantly people offer to give him lifts as he doesn’t drive. [He will actually say to us that no one offered him a lift when we have the text trail to prove him otherwise, and he sees them because he replies. Not sure if he is lying or genuinely believes it] When we mention this he says he often muted the conversation because it’s too busy. 

He sometimes tries to organise something. Usually the night of, and we can’t rearrange our schedules for him. And it is always dependant on someone else to actually make the plans as he can’t host due to still living with parents and younger siblings. He will sometimes ask if people are free on a particular day and after people respond not follow up. 
His twin brother who hangs is one of the crew tries to help out and host, but has his own child to look after. 

Earlier in the year he showed one of us a Snapchat of a cut a comment saying serrated knives are not good to cut yourself with. We are not equipped to deal with that. The recipient instantly offered to go with him to go see a psychologist, which resulted in him being ignored for the next two weeks. 

Back to this party recently he was alluding to the scars he had given himself saying it was a hard year. The one he said it too suggested that he needed to see someone to which he brushed it off as not having done it for months. He also seems to have a habit of trying to tear down the others when chatting with someone one on one and making you promise not to tell anyone. But we don’t play that game, neither keeping secrets or tearing down our buddies. He talks down about his ex insultingly, but that night goes and loves a bunch of her fb photos. 

We really want him to get help. But we can’t tell if he just tries to downplay things. He is working the same job he has since high school. And keeps getting passed over for promotion. He blames upper management for keeping him down which he tells us that local management is going to open the doors for him because they acknowledge he has been treated unfairly. But our person on the inside there tells us a completely different story. We can’t tell if he is telling stories to increase status in our eyes or if he genuinely believes it. Do we respond differently in each of these cases?

We feel if he could get a new job and get out of his parents house things could improve. His brother had pretty much secured him a new job at his place of work, all he needed to do was submit a cv, but he didn’t. 

We are quite certain of depression, but it feels like there is something more going on. And we just don’t know how to help. It is hard to do one on one catch ups with him because he seems to always be complaining/attacking someone. He seems to think everyone is against him. We really aren’t against him. We want to help him, but we are running out of ideas how. And out of emotional energy to help. 

I honestly don’t know what to do.

94,I’ve taken a lot of quizzes online about my mental health and each one told me i had severe depression and some sorta anxiety disorder. i told my mom a long time ago but she didn’t care much for it. idk what to do and i really want to die. help?,12Mar2019,1
95,"I know i need to wean myself off of it, I'll be seeing my doctor tomorrow to talk it out and figure out the next step. after that i need to find a new doctor.

My current doctor doesnt really listen, ex: after telling her i struggle with sleeping because of night terrors  she prescribed a medication that i later found out commonly causes night terrors, when i explained i was not confortable taking it my sleep problems were just put on the back burner and never adressed again.

There have been a few situations like this and i dont trust her to actually help me when considering a replacement for Zoloft. I need to go to a new doctor but my usual doctor is the only person i could get an apt. with soon enough to get the zoloft i need to wean off of it.

Zoloft has been the first medication to really help my depression and social anxiety but there are some side effects that are having too big of an impact on my life and I would rather try other medications instead of settling for the first thing i tried.

has anyone had great success with zoloft and then chose to move onto something else? what worked for you? im so worried about this transition but i need it.",12Mar2019,1

I gave a friend my sharps, poured any alcohol I had down the drain, have flushed the pills I had stockpiled: because I know last night would have been THE night...

98,"Hello to start off I am 24 M and I have pretty bad anxiety and depression.

To give a little background, I started being depressed in 7-8th grade and that is when thoughts of suicide started to creep in. (Also, I feel really bad that I feel this way because I shouldn’t. I have had a really good life with a great family and great, supportive SO, which upsets me as to why i feel like this.) 

Anyway from then I had deep dives into a really deep depression that led to a few attempts on my life and I have also had peaks where I feel great (mainly when I am distracted and not thinking about it). 

I have also had anxiety/panic attacks for little reasons. Nothing ever big, but always caused a snowball effect that led to panic attacks. 

Anyways with all this being said, I looked for help my sophomore year of college after a suicide attempt. I went to therapy for a bit and was put on sertraline (Zoloft). I hated it, because it made me feel so empty and although I wasn’t as depressed I really didn’t feel much. I stopped receiving professional help for a while but recently realized I needed help again. I tried duloxetine when I went for help this time, but it caused severe migraines. My dr. Asked if I had any suggestions of what I would like to be on and said she would have suggestions for me too, but I need some advice. 

Do any of y’all have any suggestions for antidepressants that i should take or any medicines I should avoid? 

Any help is greatly appreciated! ",12Mar2019,1
99,"So where should I start. Well, lets say my little brothers name is Tom.
 Tom is 12 years old and Im 5 years older than him (17), big boy for hes age.
 Tom and I have lost our parents when we were just little bit younger. Dad went when he was 4-5years old, and I think he knows why. Drug related debts. Mom just 3years ago, so he was 6 then. She was addicted to bubrenorphine. I knew this before she told us this but Tom didnt.
 One day it got too much and she told this for us and went to rehab, before this we saw lot of Mom nodding in different places and lot of side effects from the drug(s). We just laughed at her cuz we were young as fuck and didnt know what was going on. I started to smoke weed when I was 11yr old and it got to daily stuff when I was like 13 and lasted for almost 3years and I think my brother have known about this. 
When our parents passed away, we went to foster family in 2015 and its pretty nice. Pretty normal family overall. 

Just small backround info to understand the past.

So last year october I went to Child caring institution cause I was skipping school alot, and now Im here and Tom is at the same Family where we went then.
They moved to different city and he dosent really have friends there, so he have been playing video games for long time straight from morning to 2-3am and sometimes skips the school. 

Here is the thing we are worried about. 

Video games 24/7 and BAD social anxiety. 

Tom barrely can go buy stuff from the grocery store cause the anxiety. And I am really the only person he can talk with, so therapist wont really help and doctors probably start giving him some benzos or some like that.  What the fuck should I do. Tbh, im like father to him, from what I have noticed.

He get only A's and B's from the school and is over all a fucking Ainstein and Elon musk combined. 

Tldr; Little brother just only plays video games and has really bad anxiety from very traumatazing Child hood, what should we do. ",12Mar2019,0

I’ve been crying for what feels like 2 months and I’m starting to develop red splotches under both my eyes. I do get these at times from whipping my eyes a lot but usually they go away. Theses however are not, and there’s small bumps starting now. It’s hasn’t really bothered me till yesterday when my roommate asked me if my face hurt bc of how they looked. I hadn’t even cried that day and they are still “flaring up”. Sometimes they feel hot or tingly, but that’s rare. Maybe it has nothing to do with crying but I have a feeling I’m not the only cryer in the sub.

101,"I, unfortunately, have a bad tendency of focusing on the negative aspects of myself and my life and this leads me to be constantly worried and unhappy about several aspects of my life. I have always thought that by analyzing and repeatedly thinking about the problems, I was actually finding solutions to help me ""get better"". Well, apparently, I was wrong...

I recently learned, from my therapist, that negative and unhappy people (usually with lower energy or lower vibration) tend to focus most of their attention and thinking (about 80% or more) on their problems and the ""why me?"" and ""victim"" mentality. Successful, happy and positive people (usually with higher energy or vibration), on the other hand, spend only about 20% of their focus on the problem and 80% on the solutions and how to move on (the 3 g's- growth, giving, gratitude). My therapist mentioned that these findings have been backed by several studies which tracked the daily journals of both happy/successful people and unhappy/unsuccessful people.

This gives me mixed emotions. I feel inspired and hopeful that perhaps I can change my thinking habits to become a happy positive person some day. But, I also feel discouraged that perhaps I am just wired this way through my genetics and experiences and doomed to to remain a negative person forever because that's just who I am and how I think. I am also in my 30s so I know that change gets harder with age...

My question is: do you think it's possible to change from being a negative person (especially if you have been like that the majority of your life)  into a positive person? Have you or someone you know successfully transformed from a ""low vibration"" to a ""higher vibration"" and, if so, how?

102,"Disclaimer: not asking for relationship advice. This relationship is dead to me. 

A friend of mine keeps telling me that a guy I was with gaslighted me. I’ve read the signs and he could fall into those categories, some of them are very on point. Others are a stretch. For a while, I defended this person, but I’m starting to think that maybe he did gaslight me.

Backstory: I had a lot of blatant red flags in my face, but I ignored because he told me that I either trust him or I don’t when I would try to ask questions about it. My therapist told me it seemed like he had NPD (Narcissistic Personality Disorder) and warned me to be careful of him, but I disregarded his warning because this guy had told me that I often misspeak and miscommunicate information. So I thought that surely I did that again. A lot of people warned me about him, but he convinced me that all of them were just out to get him and that they were jealous or that they were in love with me. 

I do feel like this guy did use me in ways. I bought him a lot of things that I knew he would like or what he wanted (idk if that was my love language or what). I even bought him a gift for our anniversary/ Valentine’s Day which I later learned he had a real girlfriend at this time, but he still accepted my gift and did not tell me that he had moved on. He even continued to be with me romantically and such until a few days before I discovered his girlfriend existed, months after they started dating. He told me that the reason he was still with me was to “be sure that he really loved this girl.” I stupidly still forgave him because he told me he was really confused and I believed him. and was always there for him when he had no one else.

He pursued my best friend. She told me about it and he told me that she was coming onto him and that he could “ruin her.” He never showed me proof, but it was something that I believed until I reached out to her to apologize for choosing a boy over her this week. She told me that he kept coming onto her and that it made her uncomfortable and even offered me proof of this. 

He would go through phases of having no other friends and he would tell me that people were just jealous of him and would start drama. It was always everyone else’s fault, never his own. 

While we were together, he was talking to other girls, but would tell me that if he had to choose a “life partner,” he would have chosen me. He always told me he loved me and thought I was beautiful, a fact that he now denies. He told me that maybe one day we would be together and that he didn’t believe in LDR, something I understood. We were never bf/gf for this reason, but he assured me that I was special and that he loved me deeply.  His relationship with his new gf is a LDR so him not believing in that ended up being a lie. I forgave him and attempted to give him a chance at just being my friend after learning about his gf, but for a good month or two after, he would screenshot my Snapchat selfies and would tell me that I was so beautiful and it got to be too confusing and too much with everything.

We’ve had a stalker-type guy harassing us for a few months now (probably 8 months or more) about all of the other girls that the guy I was with has been with since having a girlfriend and since he was with me. Apparently other people, not just me, were contacted by this stalker. I don’t know too much information about those messages, but I know that pictures of me were leaked that I only sent to the guy I was with, but he denies having leaked them. 

This week, I’ve been reviewing old messages involving the stalker because I’m trying to see if any of this would hold up in a police case since both he and the stalker are international. I don’t know my options for prosecution yet, but reviewing everything is making me realize a few things that I originally didn’t see as suspicious. 

Rereading the messages after reading the signs of gaslighting, I am starting to think like “definitely, maybe.” At one point, we were in a group message together, me, him, and his new gf (courtesy of this stalker) and his gf told me that he had said he had been “rejecting me for years” and that I was obviously “delusional” because of him constantly rejecting me, which was not true even a little bit true. He had been flirting with me prior to that. My ex (whatever you want to call him) had come to me in a private message after the spat with his gf telling me to not talk about our relationship in front of them because it was giving fuel to the stalker and that his gf was just confused about dates and so his story changed to “she and I weren’t dating when I was messaging you all of those things” then eventually he denied sending me messages like that at all and from what I’ve heard now is that he has been saying that I was sending him explicit messages and he was not reciprocating at all. Obviously not the truth. 

The ex has gone as far as to tell me that a lot of things that have happened are my fault, including this guy stalking us. A few months ago, I had a complete mental breakdown because he told me more or less that I caused him so much grief and that I hurt him and it made me feel really bad. I fell into a huge toxic self deprecation cycle, but thankfully I got out of it. When he told me a week or so ago that this stalker was my fault, I sat here thinking, “maybe I am this terrible”, but I am also starting to think “maybe he just wants me to feel bad for him and to place blame on me.” I find myself often conflicted between “am I overreacting / playing victim?” and “this guy played with my head” 

How do I know if this is actually gaslighting? Also, if it is how do you move on from being gaslighted? ",12Mar2019,1

When I read history and see the massive lands and empires that people controlled and held it just seems impossible to me. If I try and think about what my friends are doing right now I can't believe that they're real unless I'm talking to them. If my friend is on FaceTime I can't believe that there is actually a person in their homes miles away speaking and interacting with them through their phone. Other nations and far away lands don't seem real. I'm a physics major here at school, taking some space exploration classes, I can't believe that there are currently rovers on Mars as we speak... when I see people in class it's as if Im watching them on TV, they're not actually there. I look at my snapchat memories from 2016/2017 and can't grasp the fact that these things actually happened and I actually observed them, simply because it's not right now and it's not right in front of me.

106,"My husband has major depressive disorder, and I have bipolar disorder I (with psychotic episodes and anxiety presenting symptoms). My husband was telling me last night about how really good times make him sad because he thinks about death and how that moment will be lost forever. He told me that after he'd burst into tears when I was singing and laughing at something stupid on YouTube. Usually he doesn't want me to ""have to"" think about his depression since he is the one who is ""supposed to be"" taking care of me (I currently don't even work). When I'm on my depressed side of bipolar I think about the same exact thing, so I know where he's coming from. He has been my support for years now, but I think it's really breaking him down and I feel like it's my fault. On the flip side of it, I want to be supportive of his feelings, but I just can't handle hearing them. I listen to them, and say what I'd want to be said to me.. basically I do everything I'd want him to do if it were me talking, but on the inside I feel like I'm going a little crazy. My psychotic episodes have been getting more frequent, and it literally feels like they correlate with times his depression is at its worst. (I've seen a couple of weird things, I've heard voices such as a lady yelling at me, and I've done a couple of weird things without the slightest memory of doing it, such as hiding our razer blades in our cupboard, or pulling out the tubing to our dryer. Those types of psychotic episodes).

Any advice on helping a spouse with a mental illness when you're mentally ill yourself? I want to be there for him the same way he's there for me, but it's really hard. We already go to therapy together, but it would be nice to hear from people who might be going through something similar, because our therapists never seem particularly helpful. Also, I've never seen a therapist who actually wants to work with someone with psychosis, because they don't know how to deal with that aspect of my mental illness.

108,"Last month my dad died from brain cancer. It all happened so fast. About 4-5 months ago we got the diagnosis that my dad had Glioblastoma Multiforme. Immediately my priorities switched into making sure my dad was as comfortable as possible and that my mom was taken care of. one of my brothers and my sister also have mental health issues, so it's been a rough situation for them too so I was trying my best to be available for everyone, and I'm lucky enough to be in a job where I can work from home (occasionally, so long as I'm not taking the piss) and my boss is really understanding and always let me take time out of work for appointments and other things relating to the situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm the youngest of 4 kids. My sister (the oldest) and my middle brother both suffer from mental health issues (I'm not sure exactly what they suffer with, but i know that they take the same medication) so I was always trying to make sure that they were okay. I never stopped to think about how I felt about the whole situation. I don't know whether it was just out of being so busy that I didn't have time to think, or whether I was just distracting myself. Possibly both I suppose?

&amp;#x200B;

We buried my dad on Friday. He is the only person I have ever known to die, and I thought that once it was all over I'd be able to take some time to myself to grieve. I felt like during that time I needed to be strong for my family and put on a brave face. make sure everything was organised and that I was there for them if they needed it, but now that it's all over, and now that I've spent the last 4-5 months suppressing everything it's almost as if none of it can come out. At the funeral i was the only one in my immediate family who wasn't visibly upset. Even my girlfriend of 3 years was sobbing and getting it all out. I felt everything, but i couldn't express any of it. I couldn't get the thought that I need to look after them first out of my head and I can't help but feel a small amount of resentment and jealousy. I hate myself for that.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried talking to my family about this, hoping to get some advice (albeit, not in as much detail) All they seem to come up with is ""Everyone deals with things in different ways"" - But I don't feel like I've dealt with anything at all. Even now I still feel everything. I've been getting headaches/migrains which I usually get when I feel stressed.

I recently wrote an article about our experience with mental health. This is a reality we live through on a daily basis and I'm sure there's many out there going through the same stuff. We took the decision to write this article during a moment of feeling helpless in the face of this condition.

When I met her we just clicked, when things were good it was amazing, when things were tough I put in the work because I believe in loyalty and in trying your hardest. Fights happen in relationships, good or bad, people make mistakes, and it's important to be able to forgive, forget, and work on your issues as a team (at least that's what I believe). She doesn't respect me, or love me, that much is plain from the things she did towards the end of our relationship, and at some moments throughout it. Regardless of us having some issues, I genuinely thought she'd be the woman I married someday. A life goal of mine is just to be a good husband and a good father, I grew up in a broken home and I want to have and give a life to/with someone that's better than my experiences have been thus far. 

I feel like a bitch for not being able to say ""I fucking deserve better"" and just banishing her from my head and my heart. I hate myself for missing someone who could do this to me. I'm not perfect, don't let this make you think I'm a saint or I don't make mistakes, the only thing I can say with confidence is that I always try to learn, improve, and not repeat them. I just don't know what the fuck to do anymore, or how to feel, and I'm really just not ok.

120,"Hey Reddit,
I’m a 17 year old male in high school and these past two days have really been wild. On Friday, I noticed that some people who I used to have a decent relationship didn’t really seem to reciprocate the same energy and didn’t seem as enthusiastic to see me today or talk to me when I tried to start a conversation. I wasnt able to tell if someone said something about me which was untrue, and tried to ask a few of my friends if it was anything personal and they said no, but still proceeded to ignore me for the rest of the day when I thought there wasn’t any hard feelings. Suspicious, but I can’t remember if I did anything and neither can any of the friends who did still talk to me. This week though, I decided to forget about those who I lost and who won’t respond when I try to talk to them and cherish those who were still my friends. But I can’t tell if I’ve developed anxiety or not, because these past two days I’ve been having a good day until about 11am-1 pm, then all of a sudden I become uncontrollably pessimistic and can’t even catch my breath with how anxious I become. I start feeling like I can’t be the same funny joyous person I used to be and Im becoming more distant from my friends or people who aren’t unclear with me. I tried talking to my friends about how I’ve been feeling today but I felt like I was being ignored or they didn’t really care. But I can’t tell if my newfound anxiety has been making this worse than it actually is and I just have a hard time projecting myself and being clear. I’ll start wanting to bawl my eyes out, but then after a while no tears will come out and I’ll come back to my senses and be happy and everything will seem fine again. after I stopped feeling that way today and I looked back on it I was wondering why I was feeling so pessimistic over it when it didn’t seem like it was worth getting myself down over. I don’t think it’s bipolar since it’s only been this week and I haven’t had any manic highs I just get anxious and pessimistic then I’m fine. How do I make this stop? I’m afraid this kind of thing will keep happening and I just want to go back to how things were before.  ",12Mar2019,3

124,"I am a 16 year old male and I am a sociopath. Until the past noveber I had severe depression and also I was suicidal. All that changed thanks to a girl I met at school. After we met we quickly warmed up to eachother and started to date soon. We've been dating for almost 4 mounths now. At our first date I told her that I was a sociopath and that I never understand anybody because I don't feel empathy and that how I manipulated everybody around me mostly because I simply can. I also told her that nothing made sense to me and that in my eyes everything was meaningless. I told her that last year I almost slit my wrists because of severe depression caused by my arrogant, ignorant and non-caring parents and also my new high school in which I knew nobody and where everybody was simply an idiot. 

The only reason my parents are not divorced is that they have us, their two ""beloved"" kids. I have been isolated from nearly all kinds of social interraction for my entire life because of my overprotective mother. I have never visited any of my friends outside school until 6th grade and I have never stayed over at a friends house up to this age. My dad is so unrelated to the ""family"" that sometimes he wouldn't even bother to come home. I have no idea about anything going on in his personal life. I don't even know what his job is.  

Until 7th grade I was a totally different person, I used to laugh and enjoy the life, even though I had such ""caring"" parents. In 7th grade my friends used to call me ""hallow"" because I never laughed. I was a charming, funny and popular kid though, I made everybody laugh. 

Fast forward to today, I know that the antisocial personality disorder is without a cure because it is not a disease, it is a different way that one's brain works. I don't understand even my gf who means the worlds to me and probably is the only one worths anything to me. She has her needs such as to feel loved or cared or so on which is her total right to get. But I aimply can't understand the things she says most of the time and whenever I fully Open myself to her she feels miserable and depressed.

127,"I’m 15 years old and male and I have GAD as well as ADHD. I’m a swimmer and a runner. I’ve been swimming competitively for roughly 7 years and doing distance running in track for 3 years and did cross country for one season.

Now is swimming season and I feel my anxiety is intefrering with my performance at practice. This is my first time doing it for my school team btw. When it came to running I was always extremely fast and pretty good at it  and for swimming I didn’t try to go fast as much so I wasn’t very fast for a while till around 1-2 years ago.

However, now I’ve slowed down in swimming. And I think I know why. I almost feel afraid of going fast because I’m worried about losing my breath and getting hurt or maybe it’s something else.

But now when I swim I worry about things I’ve never worried about before. I can actually notice during freestyle when I’m not breathing and I feel the pain in my chest. I’m also worried about keeping up with the other boys at practice and I feel really uncomfortable when I don’t sprint. I get this really uncomfortable adrenaline rush where I feel it in my chest and stomach and it gets super uncomfortable. It gets so annoying to the point where I slow down and do some weird breaststroke kick and sometimes I even skip laps for some reason because I feel I can’t do it. This mostly happens during freestyle, or so I’ve noticed. But I’m not making the intervals which means I constantly have to swim.

I keep focusing on all of the pain when I used to not. I tried to revert my focus from it but I’m having a hard time.

I noticed I did the same during cross country and it caused me to not be as fast as I used to be. Even during my best race of the cross country season(it was a 5k) I got roughly 23 minutes. It was because I kept feeling that same adrenaline rush and kept walking but I know a aas because of my fear of getting hurt.

I don’t know if this swimming thing is the same or different but yeah. Last time I swam for club I was absolutely fine, now I’m not. I’m in constant stress and anxiety when I’m in the water. Why is this? 

I also sometimes get negative thoughts when in the pool. 

And even during this time I have felt awful even outside the pool.

I’m also at the side of the pool where faster people are during practice and since varsity has different practice hours, they’re just finishing when we start to do dry land workouts and one day, all of us in the faster lanes when into he lanes in the middle of the pool while varsity was finishing. I swam normally for a while. I started difficult but for a while I swam normal. Till we went back to the fast side of the pool. The thing is, it was all the same people.

I’m just so confused because this is also affecting my levels of anxiety when not in the pool and idk what to do.

Any support or advice is much appreciated and if you’re a swimmer who has gone through the same or similar experience and overcome it, I’d really love to hear your experience as it’d be a big help to me. ",12Mar2019,1

130,"Hi all, I hope this post doesn’t go against any rules and please let me know if it does. 

I’m 31, and something that’s been on my mind a lot the past while, but much more as of recently, is that I don’t remember a lot of my youth, mainly between the ages of 10-16 (to the best I can think of). 

My main connection to this is that recently I was talking to my mom, and we were having a pretty big heart to heart and life talk. My parents separated when I was about 17, and the last few years of their marriage was *bad*. No one ever hit anyone, but there was a lot of yelling, slamming doors, arguing, tense dinners, and naturally some of this landed on me. 

After my parents divorced, this long healing process began and it actually brought us closer together. I had some addiction and mental health issues of my own that were mainly resolved by the time I was 24, and it’s almost like as a family we got a lifetime of drama settled by then. Since around then, we’ve generally all been wonderful to each other, with an air of “we’ve already put each other through so much shit let’s just be good to each other ok?”  

However, I’ve been having some trouble recently with work and money and it’s been spiking my stress. While talking to my mom about it, she more or less apologized (again) for how hard my middle school and high school years were in terms of my home life, and how this helped set me up for a hard time in college (which I wasn’t really ready for at the time). 

But when I think back to that period of time, I really really can’t remember a lot of my home life. I can recall funny stories with my friends, concerts, big events at school, but it feels like there’s this big black spot over my life at home. 

I don’t know if this is a complex, but I’ve always felt like my interests were stupid or silly or not what I should be focused on. My parents *never* propagated that, and were always very supportive. But still, I can remember a really strong impulse to hide things, not even bad things (although that happened to for its own reasons). 

I sometimes wonder if this “black spot of memory” is my subconscious way of not allowing my *adult self* to see the things I liked and the way I felt. I’m not sure if this is my brains way of not thinking about how hard those years were. I don’t even *remember* recognizing that my parents’ relationship was deteriorating that much. My mom and I are both recovered alcoholics, and she’s frequently talked to me about how messed up alcohol made her as a mom during those years. But I don’t *remember* any of that. 

It feels scary. 

Is this in fact normal, and I’m conflating it? Is there anyone else who might be able to shed some light on this? Is this something that other people go through? Did I just smoke a lot of weed through my life? (I have, but i never figured it would seemingly do that sort of memory wipe). 

With that said, these days my parents and I are wonderful to each other, and there’s a lot of love there. 

I appreciate any and all feedback, and I wish you well with whatever is going on in your world. ",12Mar2019,1

137,The psychiatrist prescribed me Seroquel yesterday to help with insomnia and mood. I do not have bipolar but he thought that it would help with my sleep and possibly help decrease anxiety and irritability. He gave me 25mg to take at night and every few nights gradually increase to 100mg and if it works we could add 25mg in the morning to help with anxiety and mood. I have a terrible fear of weight gain. He told me that it typically only causes weight gain in people who take high doses (when prescribed for schizophrenia or bipolar). I also take Wellbutrin which he said suppresses appetite (I take adderall xr too) so I shouldn’t worry about that. But obviously I’m still worried. I’ve lost 7lbs last month and I don’t want to gain it back + more. If anyone has experience with 75-100mg dose please share with me.

138,"I am 26 and have only been in one relationship. It was when I was 22 and it was't that conventional. When I look back at all the guys I've dated, nothing ever seems to work out. I also seem to constantly go for the *wrong* guy. Whether it's someone who literally warns me he's an arsehole before we date (newsflash - he was right), a drug addict or someone who lives on the other side of the world... it's never someone who is good for me - I am a catch, but I must subconsciously not give myself that credit. Now moving on to my crushes, it's adds to the fire. Best friends, guys with girlfriends (I do **not** go after them though), guys of a different culture that only see girls of that same culture as ""dateable"".

I had bad, emotionally traumatic things happen to me in my teenage years. I find it hard to think of these without tearing up even over a decade later. I think this has left me with the cliché ""daddy issues"" too. Disclaimer: there was no form of abuse involved, it was emotional trauma. I used drink myself as an escapism, aided by the binge-drinking culture in my country. I probably still do a bit. Despite this, I have somehow managed to do great things with my life and am very fulfilled... except when it comes to relationships. I have been happy single as I love the freedom and prioritising friendship but I'm getting to the stage where I want someone to share things with. As well as the previously mentioned ""bad boy syndrome"" or just terrible taste I seem to have, I also struggle with intimacy and being vulnerable and honest with my feelings.

The good guys, nice guys, *successful* guys that would be more appropriate for me... that like me, I never reciprocate. It's like the fact they like me is offputting. I look for every single detail that I find wrong with them and it's a massive turn off. I never do this with the ""bad"" guys.

139,"I've recently stumbled upon the term ""aphantasia"" which is pretty much when a person can't imagine things visually. Such as if someone tells them to imagine a big rock for example, they can't see it as a visual image but instead they just think of words that would describe a big rock.

When I first stumbled upon this term I knew I didn't have it. I was like ""wow, people actually can't imagine things visually?"" and I started reading into it. I related to very few posts but nevertheless my diagnosed health anxiety made me question myself (constantly think there is something wrong with me and if I see a new condition I tend to convince myself I have that particular condition).

I started imagining things like crazy, constantly thinking of a tree, an apple, me holding an apple etc. I can ""see"" all of those things but not as if I'm seeing them with my own eyes. More or less like a vague dream. If I imagine a bird for example a particular bird comes to mind visually and its sitting on a tree branch. But it's not like I'm seeing the bird, it's like I'm seeing it with my ""mind"".

But as I can't access others thoughts and know how they think I don't know how normal my visualization is and it has sparked up a little panic for me. How vivid are you supposed to be able to imagine things? Feel like they're directly in front of you and you're seeing them with your eyes? Or is it like a dream state but not exactly so vivid like in my case?

I also noticed that I can imagine objects very easily but sometimes have difficulty recalling ones face accurately. I can recall visually what they look like, but not with 100% accuracy. The more I focus on trying to remember the face in absolute detail the less detail I actually get. I don't know how to describe that really.

So I'm still 95% sure I don't have aphantasia since I can imagine things ""visually"" without having to put words in my brain to describe the thing I'm thinking of. But my mind is making me focus on those 5%. I can't access how others imagine so how will I know if how I imagine is normal?",12Mar2019,1

So I'm only 16 (afew days off 17) so I wanted to know because of that is what a therapist, can/would/must tell my parents different then if I was 18+? I have some stuff that, less then healthy/sane

151,"17 y/o here, been in the mental health system since about 10, diagnosed over time with OCD and major depression/anxiety. Been working on that over time, consistently taking a multitude of different antidepressants, until things came to a climax and I was admitted to a psych ward.

After consultation for a few weeks the psychiatrist diagnosed me with Bipolar type II and put me on both mood stabilisers and minor tranquillisers that definitely helped, but due to other unpleasant side effects I stopped taking the medication, and now take none altogether. After seeing my regular psych again they didn’t believe I was bipolar II, and I would be inclined to believe them, if not for the fact that my symptoms match up exactly as described, I have a family history of such, and the medication centred around bipolar helped tremendously.

I’m sorry if this is a shit show to read and a bit of a vent, I’m extremely ignorant to how things work and I’m just confused about my next step, how do I help myself I I don’t know what’s going on?

Thankyou.",12Mar2019,1
152,"My brother has recently started heroin and he has been thinking drones has been following him around, and back in the day my brother also said he ""was in control"" of everything at a party. ( he was not one drugs) I dont know exactly if its psychosis but I do think the drugs induced or triggered the psychosis. ",12Mar2019,1
153,"Hi,  thank you for taking the time to read this. I will start off with a bit  about myself. I am currently in a very intense academic training that  is extremely stressful and time consuming. I have a history of  depression and self-mutilation. I have been to therapy before and I am  currently waiting to see another therapist through my university. I am  on some sort of waitlist and I don’t know when I will be able to get in  to see someone and I feel helpless right now.

My  partner already has their career established, done with school and is  working and is making good money. I, on the other hand, am living off  student loans and feeling overworked and honestly starting to become a  bit burnt out. I know this is all a means to an end but I think it is  pertinent information to my current mental health status.

I  have had some recent fights with my significant other in regards to my  reaction when they decided to leave town for a couple of days. We don’t  get to spend very much time together and I was actually going to have a  little free time and was hoping to be able to spend some quality time  with them before finals week. We do live together and see each other  every day but I am often so busy studying so it really isn’t quality  time. The way I reacted was inappropriate. I didn’t want them to leave  and was acting foolishly and we got in a fight. I did this the last time  they decided to leave town to visit with friends as well. It isn’t fair  of me to do react this way and I know that. I don’t know what is wrong  with me and why I can’t control it but I get upset. I feel ridiculous  and foolish because of it. I am making my partner feel restricted in  what they are “allowed” to do.  This is unhealthy and I don’t want to  make them feel this way. It is not fair.

In  addition to this, any time my partner has a problem with something they  have trouble bringing any issues up with me because every time they do I  become this self-loathing black hole of despair and depression that is  just unreasonable. It makes it very difficult for them to talk about  problems in our relationship because of these extremely unhealthy coping  mechanisms that I have. I am at a loss for how to control this  irrational behavior. I understand that this is going to take a lot of  therapy to work through and I am trying to get in for therapy but I  don’t know when I will be seen. I feel really alone right now and like I  don’t have anyone to talk to.

Any time  my SO brings something up I immediately fall into the thought cycle of  how terrible of a person I am and don’t even understand what they see in  me. This obviously makes it difficult for any constructive solutions to  whatever the problem might be. My partner and I are very much in love  and want to work through this together. They know I am struggling with a  lot and that I am trying to work on things. We both want this  relationship to work but my behavior and my depression is taking a toll  on the health of our relationship. Please help. Thank you in advance.",12Mar2019,2
