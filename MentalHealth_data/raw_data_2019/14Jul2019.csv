0,"Sorry if those questions are inappropriate for this sub. I just ask for a bit of help, since I haven't found anything before

A brief introduction. I was very emotionally bleak (like, everything is too weak except fury) and bad at empathy (I know what others feel, but really am not able to feel ot for myself, like, when my froend got leukemia recidive, I thought that is is absolutely horrible and tried to help, but felt absolutely nothing) for all my life. Three years ago, I've met some friends that are the vice-versa, extremelly emotional and really good at getting other's feelings. Since then my lack of emotionality and empathy began to be a problem. A massive one. 

So, two questions. Is the lack of those two normal by any means? And is it possible for them to be manually developed?",14Jul2019,1
1,"Ok so for the past few nights strange things have been happening to me. Just at night i woke up at 2:40am for no reason so i tried going back to sleep but then at 2:45am i hear things outside my window and they seem to be cartoon voices and not actual human voices. The night before i heard strange laughing coming from outside and the night before that i heard my room mate making weird sounds outside at night through my window. My room mate tends to stay awake during these hours so i asked him if he also heard them which he replied to as ""no thats weird"" I don't know if this is just me or if someone is out there messing with me and it only seems to happen at night.",14Jul2019,1

I am in a much better place as of now, and my schizophrenia isn’t as bad as it was, I had a very bad flare up. How can I tell my parents without making them freak out or overreact, and I know it’s a very serious thing, however my parents are very uncomfortable with the subject of my mental health and they might try to nerf my world, to make it easiest even though that’s not what I need.

4,"TL;DR: Brother is suffering intense vomiting due to what we think could be anxiety. They last for DAYS. This is clearly self harm, but he refuses to consider help. Is there anything I can do without being an asshole? 

My brother has been struggling with severe anxiety for a large part of his life. More recently, has caused physical consequences such as intense vomiting, and this is having a very profound effect on his daily life. 

When he is in the midst of an episode (as my mother has taken to calling it), he is vomiting every 10 minutes, cannot even keep water down, and is showering incessantly. He says that he does not know what else to do... the obvious answer would be to contact a professional, but I am not allowed to say this (mom babies him and refuses to let anyone say anything that will not comfort him). This pattern is clearly self harm, but she refuses to see that in her precious baby, and he needs help.

I'm here because I have no idea what else to do. I too have dealt with a lot of depression and anxiety, but have taken numerous steps to ensure that I can do the things that need to be done in my daily life. He is doing no such thing, and lies or dodges the subject when asked. I don't want to be an asshole about this, but it is clear to me that something must be done.",14Jul2019,1
5,"Bit complicated to explain. I've noticed a pattern of behavior in myself that results in me freaking out/lashing out at people verbally (never physically). I'm trying to understand the inner workings of my mind to understand where the glitch in thinking/reasoning is occurring. I'm making false assumptions about other people's subjective experience and intentions towards me. And then I run with it, perceive them as a threat, and treat them as such. When in reality, they weren't really a threat to me, or they were a very minor threat.

I have a history of being abused. Mostly psychological/mental abuse, some physical abuse too. I think whatever error in thinking that I'm doing--resulting in my negative and unwanted behavior--is somehow linked to my history of abuse.

An example: I had sex with someone about a month ago, and we did it in such a way that I got injured badly. However, it was an accident. But when the injury occurred, we didn't acknowledge it or talk about it... and when the guy texted me the next day to show that he cared, it honestly seemed like he was mocking me. I saw red. My anger engulfed me. I freaked out at him until 3AM via text. I didn't curse him out or insult him. But I definitely freaked out and it snowballed into something else.

The next day after I calmed down and reflected, I realized that I misperceived him and his intentions completely. He wasn't mocking me, he was demonstrating empathy the way he knew how. I keep doing this freak out thing over and over whenever there is a perceived or real threat to me.

Does anybody have insight into this? What is the name for this psychological process happening in my mind? It's like I go into fight or flight mode and it becomes really hard to think rationally when I get into that mode. I don't want to repeat this cycle",14Jul2019,1
6,"It seems to be contagious because my brother is going through the same thing.

While i am a Extroverted personality lately i have been acting very Introverted, i do not think it is a flaring of my current mental illness (OCD) as i currently take medication for that which is working well, but in the past (say) 2-3 months i have been bombarded by negative self talk and obsessing over it. I had a terrible 21st birthday when i went out, the whole time i was just self aware of myself and thinking ''Am i creepy, am i ugly, see those people they don't like you'' and after i had those thoughts i just got a feeling of anxiety in my stomach and just told myself ''This was a shit idea, let's just go home into your shell and do nothing besides Netflix''. 

This negative self talk seems to be directly tied to Self Esteem, i think i have been secluded for such a long time that i have lost my natural extroversion. It seems to be some existential phase where i need to get to know myself more, where i need to act on something and change something in order to be happy with me again and go out like i used to",14Jul2019,9
7,"Hi. 
I'm really struggling and I don't know what this post is going to be. I'll probably end up deleting it as always because I get panicked about posting or opening up. 

I don't know what to do and I don't know how to get out of this. I'm struggling a lot with feelings of depression and anxiety, but mainly depression. I was diagnosed 4-5 years ago and have been to therapy but it wasn't working well for me and I was overwhelmed so I stopped. 

Recently...  I say recently but really it's just been ongoing for a while. I don't feel like there's any point to doing anything. I spend most of my time that I'm at home lazily browsing YouTube or reddit just because it's something to do. I don't do any of my hobbies anymore. I go to Uni and work part time, and somehow I've always been able to go to do those things. But it's all exhausting. And while once long ago I was really excited to be studying what I am, I just don't feel any sort of happiness or excitement or desire to do anything. 
I think it's a combination of stress and whatnot, rather than the actual study. 

Anyway I'm on break currently and it is such a struggle to get myself to do anything and I've been having horrible feelings and thoughts rather constantly. Usually the school break would be playing games with friends, visiting friends, doing my own stuff for fun, and doing school work that I need to get done. But now I actually don't have any friends other than my boyfriend, and he's struggling with things too, and I don't know how to help him let alone help myself, and I'm afraid to open up to tell him because I know he's also struggling and I don't know what will help either of us. 

I try to look forward to things. The future could be great and maybe I'll stop feeling like this. But I can't handle being like this every day, doing nothing, being moody and emotional or feeling nothing at all, wasting my time doing nothing of use when I used to find so much fun in things. It's like before I even start doing something I'm convinced that I won't enjoy it, and then if I get myself to do something I'm constantly thinking about how I don't want to do it. 

I don't see the point in continuing with how things are. I'm struggling to get my schoolwork done because of my anxiety and depression, then I'm stressing about it because I haven't gotten anything done. And when I have done something I don't feel any satisfaction anymore telling me 'hey good job on doing that'. 
I just feel like giving up because I don't see this ending. I don't feel like I have people to talk to because I'm afraid to put more stress on the only person I'm comfortable with. I don't feel like there's a reason to continue. I was like this throughout high school and thought ""when I get out of highschool everything will be so much better and I can start new and make friends!"". And none of that happened, because I hadn't changed. Some things have been better, other things haven't. And I'm constantly just feeling like it'd be better to just give up. What am I fighting for? Nothing ever changes and I'm only going to continue to push others away or make them miserable. 

The only time I felt happy was when I was with my boyfriend but I don't want to be dependent on him to be able to live normally and be okay. It's a lot of pressure for him and he has his own difficulties. And once we have to go back home it just starts again and I'm in a bad mood the next day. 
I don't know how to get myself out of it anymore, I don't know how to get myself back to doing things I should enjoy, I don't know how to talk to people more. I always just panic and stop responding or push them away. I don't know what to do to get better and I don't know if I can be bothered to even try anymore. 

I'm probably very lucky and fortunate. I have a family that says they care about me and would be there for me. I have education and have had the opportunity to get into a field I want to study. I work and earn an income (even though it's not much at the moment). I have someone who is there for me and who wants to help me. 
But I still feel how I feel and for a long time have struggled with these feelings of unnecessary and irrational fears and thoughts, and loneliness and depression, especially as I lost friends and became unable to talk to my family about things bothering me. 

But I just don't feel happy, or even okay, or fine. I'm just getting through each day because I have to. I don't feel like there's a point to continuing and I feel like these feelings are going to last forever. 
I don't want to continue pushing if things are going to be like this, and I don't want things to stay like this it's horrible. I don't know what to do. Sorry for being a bother I'll probably delete this.",14Jul2019,2

My question is in the title, but more specifically I have been struggling with my wife leaving me for the last three years. I loved my wife and in some ways I still do. I'd like to avoid any major details because I do not know if my ex wife uses reddit and I would be mortified if she saw this. I'll try to keep this short though.  


After the divorce, I spoke with my mom about the marriage. What went on behind the scenes, etc.  I told her my version of the events and my mom told me the way I was treated was not normal and actually she felt like it was quite an abusive relationship. (I obviously take her opinion as slightly biased because she's my mom) The problem is, I have a history of mental illness, depression, bipolar disorder, at one point (before I was with my wife) I was hospitalized. I had been on and off medication throughout our relationship and during our marriage How do I know that the things I remember really happened?

10,"Hello, I've posted here before saying that things in my life weren't going well and I was feeling down. Most people suggesting seeing a therapist but I don't have the time or money for it. I feel suffocated by life and it's responsibilities. Every day I go to work, class, back to work, study and then bed. My life feels monotonous and I'm not really enjoying things. But I need the money and I need to get my classes done so I have no choice. During the regular school term, my life was all structured around work, academic responsibilities, and my family. I didn't have time for anything else.   


I don't have people in my personal life to turn to. My parents are frequently stressed about money and their failing relationships so I feel burdensome talking to them. my parents also don't understand how I feel, they tend to think it's a product of me overreacting or believe it's a mindset issue. I have plenty of friends but I don't have any close friends. I also know that I am the least exciting friend that turns group hangouts down for work so my friends have stopped inviting me out.  


I also struggle to tell my friends because life just seems so much easier for them. And I know that's dumb to say and I know that I will never entirely understand what they're going through but it all seems easier. They all have more money and parents that will support them even if they're not working. School comes easy to them and when they barely put in any effort, they get the same grades as me even though I'm constantly studying. I don't think they'd understand because their lives are just different.  


Anyway, on a much more serious note, I have been thinking about suicide daily. I have always thought about it in some shape or form but for the last year, I feel like every time things seem like they're getting slightly better I get slapped in the face with another difficult obstacle. I don't even get excited when things start to look better because I know something new is going to appear and ruin things again. I know life is just a series of ups and downs but I feel helpless knowing I'm always going to feel this miserable the thought that I'm going to keep feeling this way for the rest of my life just makes me want to disappear. I constantly wonder whether life is worth continuing if it's all just one big let down. the only thing that keeps me from killing myself is knowing that I might make my family sad or put them through unnecessary medical/burial costs. I don't have any current plans to kill myself but it's beginning to feel like more or an option every day. I'm tired of feeling so helpless all the time.

TW: Sexual Assault and Suicidal Thoughts

i’ve always been prone to rather extreme bouts of depression. My first suicide attempts was when I was 16 and it wasn’t till I got to college that I started therapy and medication. Eventually I was taken off medication and started going to group therapy sessions rather than one on one. I’m including this because i’d like to acknowledge that there was once a time when my mental health issues didn’t need extreme interventions. 

But that all that changed about 3 months ago. I was dating someone and he was the first person i’d ever been in a relationship with. I’m 24 now and he was my first real boyfriend. He raped me multiple times. The first few times involved drugs and alcohol but one assault was especially violent. It was so loud that the police were called and they were knocking on the door not long after he finished. I didn’t go with the police that day but I did quietly break up with him.

But the pain didn’t stop. I was angry at him and angry at myself. Soon that anger just turned into sadness. I felt nothing but grief and frustration. Nothing felt good anymore and every little thing bothered me. And there were times when I could still feel my ex. I keep reliving the things he said to me and hearing the sound of his voice. One night he told me what a good job I was doing. Another night, the last night, he yelled at me and banged my head on the floor the entire time he was inside me. I also had genital tearing and a bruised rib and bladder after. So there was a lot of physical pain that constantly reminded me of what happened. I accidentally peed in my car.

I hated being alive because living was just so painful. And I felt like i didn’t even deserve to be alive. I felt like a bad person. Every negative thing that was happening in my life was a consequence of me being a terrible, awful person. Every emotion i felt was wrong, and so were all my opinions and beliefs. It really stopped being about the assault and more about how I just didn’t want to be alive. I was a bad person and I was sad just for the sake of being sad. My brain was foggy and I didn’t see myself living for much longer.

So I set a date and time to kill my self. I made preparations and everything. It seems silly now, but I cleaned out my apartment and put things in boxes. I even finished up a few projects at work so my team wouldn’t be too far behind. I’d planned to kill my self on a friday and made an appointment with my therapist on a thursday. 

The therapy appointment was a last ditch effort but I’d pretty much made my mind. I arrived at my appointment and I filled out the survey. Looking back, my brain was in a very intense fog but I did admit in the survey bubbles that I was considering suicide and had experienced a sexual assault. What did I have to lose? I finally meet with my therapist and he asks me about the survey and whether or not I was in a crisis? I told him I didn’t know but that I did have my journal.

When I go to therapy, I have trouble articulating my thoughts. I always have. So my therapist and I have kept up a journal. When i’m feeling things, I write them down stream of consciousness style. Then I read my entries and we talk about how to work through them. I had a lot of entries and I kept reading and reading them. I was waiting for him to give me a pause. We usually stop and talk about what was written but this time he just sat there and I kept reading. Our hour was ending but be told me to stay and keep reading.

Here are a few entries:

""there’s so much inside of me that i’m shaking. I deserve this.""

""I WANT TO KILL MYSELF""

""sometimes i look at my selfies to remember what I look like. Am i a real person? *XXX*? that’s my name. It seems so real when it’s written down. But I don’t feel real at all.""

""i didn’t find any trees big enough and all the bridges have very high/thick walls. i don’t think I can use my car. All the tall buildings are hotels in very public areas. Only 3 are tall enough to get the job done. Pills would work but i don’t have any money. i don’t want to use a weapon either because i want my family to have a body. i’ll look again tomorrow night.""

And I’d re-written the rape but with my ex killing me instead of telling me to go to bed. 

I didn’t plan on reading as much as I did; but I was so foggy and honestly, I was probably high on my own anxiety. I don’t even know if I was speaking English. He finally takes a deep breath, after saying nothing. And he’s like, “When you began therapy, we talked about emergency crisis intervention and hospitalization. Remember?” I did remember. He says that the mental health hospital has the resources to help me and that that was the place I needed to be. He asks if I’d be willing to check myself in to the psych ward. I told him “yea.” “Great,” he says. But then he says that he’d really rather me not go alone. He says that there are police officers and staff outside, they’d take me to the emergency room. I freaked out a little bit. I wasn’t ready to go anywhere. But I calmed down and he said he wouldn’t open the door till I was ready.

So he eventually opens the door and I get into a vehicle. I work for a university and this is a university clinic. The car was driven by police but the SUV itself was just a university labeled one. We arrive at the emergency room and they hook me up to an IV. They ask a few questions and put my wrists into slings attached to the bed. I think they gave me some medication but i’m not sure. Anyway an hour later, the wrist things are taken off. 

Sidenote: When you are taken to the emergency room, your emergency contact is notified. I did not know that but my mom shows up. I swear she came out of nowhere. 

I see a psychiatrist and he asks me a few questions. I also saw a general practioner which is how I found out about my bruised rib and bladder and the tearing. Once my mom arrives, im sighed over to her. She doesn’t know about the assault, i don’t think, but she hasn’t asked why I was sent to a hospital. This isn’t my first suicide attempt so maybe she wasn’t surprised. I hated making her upset but she wouldn’t leave. She oversaw all the paperwork from that point forward. When the psychiatrist returns he says that he’d like to treat me for major depression and anxiety, symptoms of depersonalization, and PTSD. 

He prescribed Electroconvulsive therapy and for treatments to be delivered in 6 installments, all at the psych ward where i’d be for the next 2 weeks. I spent the weekend at the hospital and left for the psych ward on a monday morning. 

At 8am another car drove me to the ward and my mom had packed my bags. 

*** End of TW

The Building/Room

The hospital just looked like a giant school. It was big but not many people were there. This is a university town. It’s summer and a good portion of the population has gone. There were maybe 20 patients. I had a roommate but she checked out the day i arrived. No one else came. The rooms look like dorm rooms. And not the cool buzzfeed kind but the kind that looks like a public school classroom with beds instead of white boards. The bricks and wall were gray but there was brown padded fluff on the corners where the beds were. the bathroom had no door and the toilet and sink were automatic. The co ed showers were down the hall. The dining area looked like a high school cafeteria. Just think of your stereotypical school but with medical equipment, nurses, and insane people.

The Rules:
No shoes. Only slip ons and socks. Nothing with shoe strings.

No cell phones. But laptops, books and note pads are allowed. 

If you want to use Wi-Fi you have to wait till visiting hours or recreation time.

Patients wear blue or white scrubs. It doesn’t matter if it’s too big for them. 

You have to attend each meal and event.

You can pack toiletries but the nurse brings them to you each morning. Your toiletries and morning items are in a box and the nurse watches you use them each morning before taking the box back out.

General schedule:

6:30am: Wake Up Time

8:00am: Breakfast and medication 

9am: Group Therapy

10:30: Recreation and Group Activities (Painting, Yoga, book club, Cardio, etc. Group activities vary and all are pretty optional. It's best if you go though)

12:00: Lunch

1:00 - 5:00 Recreation Time, Group Activities, Optional Group Therapy and One on One Therapy if prescribed 

5:00 Dinner and medication 

6:00: Visiting Hour

7:30 Group Tv Time

9:00 lights out and medication 

My experience 
(finally)
So with ECT my schedule was a little different 3 days out of the week. You cannot eat before the treatment so I usually missed breakfast. Instead of being herded to the cafeteria, I had one on one with a nurse. She just followed me around. While everyone was at breakfast, I spent the mornings in the empty shower and had the sessions at 9am. I was put on anasthesia and I usually woke up in the recovery room. I stayed in the recovery room for about an hour. After the session, I was put in a wheel chair and taken to breakfast at 11am. The nurse stayed, watched me eat, and gave me medication. And since it was so late, once I was finished with breakfast, she'd take my breakfast tray and bring me a lunch one. 

(The first two days there was no food for me. They couldn't ""find my plate.""Physically, I was fine. It was like 11:30. I wasn’t hungry and even if I was, Lunch was coming. But I was a bit annoyed at being forgotten. Still, my nurse was incredibly nice and helpful.) 

After lunch, I'd write in my journal for recreation time. (None of the other patients talked to me when the nurse was around. But to be fair, she was nice but VERY chatty.)

At 2:00 I went to therapy and my nurse would leave for the day. The therapist's questions were always very general. He'd ask how I was feeling, how ECT was going, and how the medication they were giving was working. We talked about what things helped with anxiety and what didn't. Things like that.

At 3:00 I'd go to yoga. 

4:00 Group therapy

5:00 lunch

6:00 Visiting hours. Honestly, I was SO SICK of my mom. She came to visiting hours everyday. She was also in the waiting room for each morning for each electro convulsion session though she was never in the room. She lives 9 hours away and has just been staying in my apartment for the past two weeks. I know she was just worried but this is all pretty embarrassing. We don't talk about mental health in my family at. all. So she'd come to visiting hours and we'd talk about things like work, my brothers, and Sephora. We pretended that we weren't literally in a mental hospital. The closest we got to talking about it was when she was talking about how she cleaned up my apartment for me and got rid of all my packed boxes.

7:00 Movie and Snacks with everyone else

""Incidents"" 
I witnessed one ""outburst."" The person was escorted out of the cafeteria screaming about salt.

As for me, I didn't want to go to therapy one day. 8 days in, I didn't want to do it anymore. I spent recreation time laying down in my room. When it was time for therapy, I just didn't want to go. I didn't want to get in that wheel chair or get out of bed. I was so agitated and panicky. I told the nurse to leave me alone and I lamented about how no one would leave me the heck alone. I'm an introvert and that day I felt like my social battery was drained. But the exhaustion was multiplied times 1000. The frustration was searing and I don't know how long I was there before the therapist was in my room. He asked if we could talk in my room. I didn't want too. ""Why?"" ""I've already told y'all why!"" I said. 

He said that he was giving me a sedative. I really did not want to be touched but they hooked me up to an IV and gave me a shot. I was woken up a few hours later when my therapist had returned. He asked how I was feeling but I doubt, I actually said any words. I remember him saying ""OK! Everything seems fine. Let's get you some dinner."" I couldn't see and went blind for some reason. But I could feel a wheel chair. I was in the cafeteria before I realized that I had just closed my eyes and forgot how to open them. I don't remember much after that but the next day was normal. My therapist asked questions about my episode and wrote notes. 

But I was released Friday. It feels so good to have the internet again.

But looking back, the psych ward didn't cure me or help me with my long term mental health issues. I don't think it was supposed to. For me, it was as if the mental hospital was just a holding cell. It's like everyone was just waiting my crisis out and keeping me heavily sedated and medicated while doing so. The psych ward, in my experience, was just meant to stabilize me and give me an intensive treatment. I'm still relatively suicidal and sad but my brain feels way less foggy. I think the point of the hospital stay was to wait out the worst part of my mental breakdown and make me more receptive to regular therapy, real recovery, and long term care. I feel less intense, but in a good way. 

This post is all over the place but I'd like to end it by saying that psych wards are not that scary. They are helpful and necessary. But they also aren't a quick fix or a replacement for treatment. Psychiatric hospitals are designed to disarm you when you are a danger to yourself and others but only via sedation and observation. They don't provide support or emotional labor, just a vigilant eye and, at times, tough love. It's likely that you will leave the psych ward feeling the same way you did going in. But this time you are no longer on an emotional high and holding a literal and/or figurative gun to your head. The Psych Ward helps you unload the gun but sometimes you're still holding the weapon and it will take a lot more introspection, therapy, and healing before you're ready to put it down completely. 

I will be starting therapy with my real therapist soon and maybe one day I'll be healthier and happier.",14Jul2019,3

I don't think I'm a psycho/sociopath because I'm very empathetic, people say I'm emotional. Thing is, I don't say rude things, I don't act in a rude manner. I think honestly people don't like that I seem to not really care about them, they feel like I'm using them in some way because I hear that people think I just act nice.

28,"(I'm so sorry for how long this is, I tried to make it as concise as possible. It's just every detail of this is really important to me as it may help me recover.)

If you do read this, please tell me your thoughts. I really would love to have another's insight! (And maybe some reassurance my thoughts are actually valid and sane)

A little background: I have some pretty severe emotional, behavioral and social issues. I am also pretty good (I like to think and what proves considerable evidence proves) at understanding people and potentially guiding them down better paths through my understanding and I like doing it. Although it is often pretty uncomfortable to do so because of how socially awkward I truly am. So I am currently majoring in psychology to help my self and help others. So I do a lot of introspection on my own behavior. And sometimes when I reach an important realization I type it down, so I don't forget and can potentially show a psychotherapist, so they can better understand and help me. 

I also hope this can help someone reading this to come to their own realizations and begin healing.

Disclaimer: This may not be totally coherent because of how excited I was to come to this realization.

Here it goes: I put all of another persons feelings and problems ahead of my own. So I shift all my focus, time and effort on them to make sure theyre stable (and partially so I can shift focus away from my own ""uncomfortable"" emotions). Although it is completely my own fault for not doing it, I do this I still resent the person, life, everything for the fact im not able to address my own feelings. I guess like ""Even though I will do everything for everyone, I still get no chance to talk about my beliefs or my problems! What the fuck?? Fuck this shit!"" Even though, without my realizing, it's an internal cause (my unwillingness to stop focusing on the words of another, and to share my own thoughts and feelings), I'm blaming an external factor (other people). 

TL;DR: I cannot stop putting people's feelings in front of my own. And it causes a lot of dysfunctional behavior and negative emotions.

Now that I realize this I feel relieved I know, but also feel totally incapable of changing it. And for some reason.. apathetic. But I believe the apathy is just a coping mechanism for depression. My reasoning and belief for this is: Not caring at all about anything let's me just "" go with the flow semi blissfully"" and not constantly get hurt by negative feelings by brushing them off as unimportant and saying ""Who Cares?""

29,"I feel bad. I genuinely do. My friends ask to hang out and I just...Can't get myself to hang out with them. I want to hang out with them...in theory. But when the day actually comes, I just don't feel it anymore. I'm scared of not having fun. I'm scared of it being awkward. I don't think I'll enjoy it. I know I'll get mentally exhausted after a few hours and then have to leave early. I love my friends, I really do, but between my fear of people not liking me and therefore leaving me and not being my friend anymore and the lovely thing that schizoaffective disorder does to me that makes me so isolative, I just can't manage to do it.   


I stick to calling one person every day, and I love him to literal death, but on the days he isn't home or the days where I'm just itching to get out of the house but don't have any social capacity, I feel so lonely, bored, and just...I dont have fun. This has been a problem for me for over a year now. It started during my rock-bottom point of my schizoaffective disorder, and then I got hospitalized for 7 months, and then I got out and it just continued. I thought it'd be better when I got out, but I guess I didnt assimilate myself back into the world properly and just never addressed it.

32,"During my time trying to get help for issues regarding sadism and sadistic traits, I've discovered that the way pop culture and media frames sadism is doing a lot more harm than I imagined. 

It seems that the word ""sadism"" is being thrown around for attention in online articles, even from sites that claim to be mental health related. Sadism has been reduced to another boogeyman just like psychopathy and narcissism. ""sadistic"" is seemingly being used interchangeably with ""evil"" and ""wicked"" and it just isn't getting the kind of treatment a mental health issue deserves. Mental health issues ought to be approached with some degree of sensitivity. Framing any mental health issue as something from a horror film is only going to cause a wave of ignorance on all fronts. 

I don't feel particularly attacked by these narratives, but I do see how it can be very problematic for some people. Not only are these articles making it harder for people trying to understand sadism to find the resources they need, but it's reinforcing this belief in people with sadistic tendencies that they are inherently bad and evil. If there's one thing we don't need, it's everyday people walking around thinking they're born criminal masterminds because they are sick. If the emotional turmoil isn't bad enough, just think about how it would be to internalise those thoughts and act out accordingly. 

The media often frames people with sadistic tendencies as being happy with their situation. I can guarantee you, that is not the case a lot of the time. It can be stressful, and even agonising to live with an obsession that becomes so severe that it takes over everyday life. Do note that this has nothing to do with sadism as a kink either, even sexual sadism is not inherently related to BDSM. BDSM can be 100% under control and healthy. It becomes a mental health issue once it harms the individual to a strong degree. That's something all mental health issues have in common, and this shouldn't be forgotten no matter what issue we are discussing.",14Jul2019,2

34,"I recently have moved back home after living in a city far away from home. I left college (I had good grades) and moved out at 18 because I had no interest in living with my parents (not that i dindt have a good household), let alone with other people. I am now 21. I loved the city life, except I never cared to meet people. I preferred staying inside, or keeping to myself people watching. I always stay up late at night until 2 or 3am and either wake up at 4-6am or 1pm, with no in betweens. After a year or so living there, I met a girl, well actually she came to me, and we ended up being a couple. She was my second real ""girlfriend"" since I have really high standards and usually dont talk to girls unless they're very attractive and fun and usually get girls way out of my league (Im a good looking guy, and in great physical shape). It was one of those situations where I just did the things I know I was supposed to do in attempting to get a girl, almost like I acted it all out and played my ""role"" perfectly as she fell very in love. And I enjoyed knowing that what I was doing was working, but not because I actually cared if she loved me or not but because it was entertaining and exciting for me in a way.  Except... I didnt love her. Like, at all. She always said during arguments that she could see in my eyes that I didnt actually care, or I couldnt emotionally understand where she was coming from. I agree too, everything I do or say is from a strict logical standpoint and I rarely make emotional decisions or let emotions get in the way of things and often found it difficult to even know what we were truly arguing about and why. Anyway, we broke up. Its not that I dont have emotions, I definitely had emotions for the first girlfriend, but Im very selective with them and can easily take them out of my mind. 

Now that Im home, my parents are in a rough spot financially, and Im just doing whatever it is I feel like doing with my life. I couldnt care less my parents are struggling and working hard, and I couldnt care less what my siblings are doing. I just dont feel the need to care, I was on my own for a the last few years and I just dont feel obligated to care. But its not in an egotistical, edgy way like my mom thinks (shes always on me telling me im not who shes raised etc etc) but i just simply and genuinely dont care.

I have a few friends that I have told I moved home, but not everyone knows. They're all doing their own things and are both prospering and struggling in their lives and when we hang out and they talk about their lives and problems, I in a way try and pretend to care more than I do with my facial expressions and reactions. Its not that I dont care, because I do, but i see problems more of what they are for its face value and not how they impact others. 

I also never have anxiety, or fear of anything really. I approach things straight up despite consequences or ulterior endings that many anxious people conjure in their minds. 

Thats really all I have, but I do want to add this. When I meet new people, I always try and read them and modify my initial engagements with them as i see fit. I do this sorta unintentionally but I think its fun to see if I was right or wrong with reading who they are. One of my best friends told me that I usually am a verbally passive aggressive person with new people, but I never do it in a way that makes that person not like me as I typically leave a very positive first impression on people and they always remember who I am. Not sure if passive aggressive is the appropriate term to use but dont want to replace it with my own words.",14Jul2019,2

This is literally my second day taking the medication and I’ve noticed my emotions are all over the place. I have never really experienced anything like this before. I was thinking that maybe this is a form of an emotional purge and the rapid change in emotions is due to some form of emotional repression that is starting to unravel and, as a result, my body is trying to keep up with this overload of emotion which is why the feelings are not very constant. I know it takes at least a week to really start making an impact in terms of helping with depression, but I was wondering if the drug could possibly be contributing to this or if this was just a new way my depression is manifesting itself.

But I need to improve my grades to get accepted in the college of my choice. Since last year I've been trying to focus on my studies and improve myself but it's nearly impossible. I've tried everything from waking up early to study, staying up late, during the day, meditating and even some drugs (legal). But I simply can't bring myself to focus. I can't concentrate on anything and the maximum attention span I recorded was about 5 minutes. And even then I don't seem to comprehend what I've studied. In the class, when paying attention I have no problem grasping concepts and such. And I've recently started to notice that I misspell a lot of rather common words. I don't know what I'm going to do and it scares me out of my wits. It's like almost everyday I make up my mind to study and every single day I go to sleep disappointed. I don't really communicate with anybody about this as it makes me uncomfortable. The only person I've talked to is my best friend and I don't think that he can really do anything. What can I do to change this ? Any reply will be immensely appreciated.",14Jul2019,1
54,"Back History: Mentally and physically abused as a child. Like “I don’t know if I will be alive to make it into adulthood.” kind of abuse. Abuse stopped around the age of fourteen because the abuser was ordered to separate from us. Moved out at sixteen with a friend who was 10 years older. We started a relationship at my age of seventeen. She had 2 kids and I was the stepfather role. Lasted for 2 years and during that time I had zero contact with most of my family. Few years later I met my first wife and shortly after starting to date found out she was pregnant by her last boyfriend. I was with her through the entire pregnancy and cut the cord. In my eyes at the time I was the father. Marriage didn’t last and I joined the military. Tried to make it work during but we divorced and I haven’t seen her child since. Out of the military and met my wife. I have a good job, house, and son. We are in love and happy as ever.",14Jul2019,18

56,"I have literally made a reddit to vent. 
I don’t want any advice as I feel as if I’ve heard it all. Unless it’s something that has actually WORKED for you. 
My brother who was always the intelligent ‘golden boy’ growing up ended up with anxiety and depression during sixth form. (Probably due to the pressures he faced living up to that title) He wouldn’t turn up to classes and had teachers come round to pick him up to basically force him to school, (which isn’t at all helpful).  
It has now been 6/7 years and he never leaves the house. He is unbelievably skinny and pale with extremely long hair. He looks sick, because he is. He just sits on his computer all day. He doesn’t receive money or anything, it’s like he’d rather just not exist. 
I always look for advice on the internet of what to do and how to help. It’s the same old shit- “patience, treat it as an illness, try not to blame, say that you understand” and while I understand all of this and have been doing all of this, it’s just extremely frustrating, because a) it hasn’t actually produced any positive results and b) it is basically walking around on egg shells and not saying what’s truly on my mind. 
I’m starting to think tough love is perhaps the way forward. 
Maybe it will be a wake up call if my mum says “you aren’t contributing to paying for internet so you aren’t allowed your computer.” Or “you don’t pay your phone bill so you don’t get to have a phone.” 
It’s so annoying that I am working and giving my mum keep money, paying my own way and buying the larger appliances for the house and the one responsibility the boy has is to wash the dishes!!! And that’s only because I basically fought with my mum on several occasions to give him some responsibility around the house and she eventually caved. And credit where credits due he does do this everyday. Although I once had to work myself up to say to him, “can you please just do the washing up. It’s the one thing your asked to do.” And since then he has done it religiously. He also used to eat his dinner upstairs and not with the family and I told my mum it’s the one interaction he has with physical humans he should be down here. She said she had a word however he continued to take his food to his room until I told him that what he was doing was rude. The first night he ate his dinner pissed off but after that has eat with us and we all enjoy this time together. My brother has also said in conversation that he feels when his siblings say things it’s like a wake up call. These are the only two times in the 6/7 years I have confronted him about his behaviour and he has actually acted upon them. Perhaps I need to open my mouth a little more rather than follow the internets advice of sitting back and accepting. 
Because it was such a battle before I am in two minds whether to suggest to my mum (who doesn’t really want my advice) to give him more. Like the laundry or cooking meals. (These are more of my responsibilities.) I remember leaving a job (after saving lots of money to still give keep) because I was so unhappy and what was said to me was “well if you aren’t working this house better be spic and span”. Maybe that was said because I am a female lol. 
Anyway that unemployment period lasted all of 2 weeks. 
My mum never speaks about it, and I have had conversations with my brother where he has cried and opened up, and while I think this is good I don’t want him to end up upset after every conversation we have. We are 2 years apart in age so have always naturally been quite close. My mother is a big old pushover who buries her head in books rather than deals with situations. She never has meaningful conversations with any of us (5 in total) and turns a blind eye, she is one of those people who is quick to judge everybody else forgetting she lives in a big old glass house. 
I have recently been in two minds whether to give a brother a piece of my mind but I am becoming upset and angry because I am tired of constantly worrying and fearing about his life. I am tired of my feelings not being heard and believe it or not I’m one of those people who don’t open up, hence why I am here. I just want to TALK about my situation with people who can understand where I am coming from. I need to stop trying to deal with him or ‘fix’ him. I need to start to put myself first and start truly accepting the situation and for me, speaking about how it affects me is the first step.",14Jul2019,7

59,"I was diagnosed with bipolar at the beginning of this year after experiencing debilitating anxiety and depression since I was 14 (I'm now 23). I was studying psychology at a really good university and just started failing all my subjects despite having been a high distinction student so I got my doctor to write me a note and took a semester off. I started volunteering with kids and ended up getting a great job as a behavioural therapist with children, but now uni is about to start again and I just feel overwhelmed again. I'm so scared.

60,"I just sent a small letter to my mother asking her to not make me hug my abuser when they ask for a hug and I decline, this occurs on a daily basis, then she says “Just hug him so he’ll be quiet.” further enabling his entitled views towards me, someone he sees as his property. I still live with my mother and my abuser and I try to avoid him as much as possible and try to just pretend he is not there most of the time. My mother tries to force me to interact with him and “mend” our relationship. But to be quite honest, it’s irreparable, he’s got bipolar disorder, is a narcissist and is still coping from abuse he endured as a child. My childhood has been something straight out of a nightmare or horror story and I am still very much damaged from it, and being forced to hug my abuser everyday is just a reminder that my feeling towards my person do not matter as long as I am in this house. She claims she’d always pick me over him, but actions speak louder than fucking words and i am very close to just living on the street in order to be away from these people. When I tell her she’s an enabler, she gaslights me and treats me like i’m insane, they both do, i can’t stand it anymore really. She knows about my depression and suicidal thoughts/actions so does he and the first time he saw my self harm scars he put on the most fake hysterical crying it made me sick how forced and faked it was. He does not give one f*ck about anyone but himself and what he wants. He has flat out told me that as a woman my place is to be quiet and below the man. I don’t know if I can do it anymore he is just the worst person I have ever met, he’s a monster, the things he did to me are horrendous and I suffer from PTSD and severe anxiety. which my mother thinks she can cure by yelling at me.

62,"TW: Suicidal ideation 

I have been struggling with mental health issues since I was a child. My father was emotionally and physically abusive and my mom scrambled to provide for my two sisters and me in my father’s frequent absences. The pain and worthlessness my father made me feel followed me into my teen and early adult years when I entered unhealthy friendships and relationships, which always seemed to end chaotically. 

Recently, I was diagnosed with bipolar depression. Even though I’m mentally ill, I understand that I’m accountable for my actions. I try to recover by seeing a doctor for medications and a counselor. I’m grateful that both of these services are made available at a cheaper cost because I do not have and cannot afford health insurance, like many other Americans. 

However, it seems like no matter what I do to try and build a life for myself and become a stable, kind person, I always fail. I’m tired of trying medications to stabilize my mood that don’t work. I’m exhausted by constantly being haunted by traumatic incidents that happened a few years ago. I talk to my counselor but nothing seems to get better. 

After multiple attempts, I finally finished college at the age of 27 a few months ago. I live alone and have to work two jobs, seven days a week to make end’s meet. I’m worn out and feel hopeless. I don’t regret finishing my degree but it’s extremely difficult to find a job in my field, or perhaps I’m approaching the job search incorrectly. 

I can’t sleep at night anymore, even with medication. I’m lonely and long for friends and a significant other who do not need weed or alcohol to have fun. I feel like a failure for struggling to work 7 days a week and my family and friends don’t understand when I try to articulate my pain to them. My pain is always overshadowed by their issues and it becomes a competition to see who has it worse when I just wish someone would tell me that my struggle is valid and offer to take a walk and talk. 

The emotional pain is becoming unbearable and I physically hurt. Working in customer service doesn’t help when customer jabs feel ten times more personal than they should be. I wish I had the courage to take my life because my chest  hurts and I can’t get through an hour without tearing up. The thought of what taking my life would do to my mother and pet cat (who depends on me) keeps me physically going. 

All I really want in life is to find a stable career where I can acquire benefits and a livable wage or salary, work 40 hour work weeks and then volunteer on weekends, find a healthy life partner, and maybe move to the mountains from the Midwest where I currently live. I want to find purpose and help others, but find it difficult when I’m having trouble helping myself. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve been committed to psych units in the past and they don’t help. I feel incurable and damaged when I try so hard to try to make life better. Just want to the pain to stop.",14Jul2019,2

Of course I was not moving from my bed, but when waking up I'd have these extremely vivid hallucinations in which I was in a totally different room, and they would take quite a while to fade.

67,"hey friends! had a pretty frustrating morning that i wanted to vent about; figured it may be relatable for some of y'all.

&amp;#x200B;

my counselor retired, and recommended another counselor to me. i'd heard of some other counseling options, including one specifically for the LGBTQ community, of which i am a member, as well as another offered by my insurance. i figured this might be a good opportunity to give them a try!

&amp;#x200B;

spoiler alert: it didn't work out

&amp;#x200B;

first, i tried the service offered thru my insurance. there was some sort of glitch that literally would not let me schedule an appointment, despite spending a good bit of time making a profile, filling out questionnaires, etc. pretty frustrating, but not the end of the world! sent them a bug report &amp; moved on to the next opportunity.

&amp;#x200B;

the LGBTQ option got off to a great start-- i've really struggled to find counselors familiar with the LGBTQ community, so i was very hopeful-- but then at the very end i discovered that it was prohibitively expensive. they even offered me financial aid, but it wasn't enough to make it affordable for me. so close, but so far.

&amp;#x200B;

good thing my counselor gave me a recommendation, because my other options dried up real fast! 🙃 at least by going that route i know i can get an appointment and afford the services!

68,"Tonight, on Discord, I was relentlessly tormented for a bunch of different things. Some of my 'friends' told me I was always complaining and using my anxiety as an excuse and told me I was just as manipulative as my abusive ex. They told me my depression wasn't valid because they had suffered more than me, and more things like that, like how my self deprecating jokes were begging for attention and sympathy.

I went crying to my mum who then told me this was serious, and she was thinking of calling the police. I went back to my room and she came in, told me in an extremely angry tone that she had work tomorrow and needed to sleep. I started crying again because I didn't know what to do and she sat down, held my hands and said really firmly 'You're being manipulative like (My ex's name)' - She said it twice.

I want to kill myself. I don't know what else to do. Nobody cares about me and I feel like such a piece of shit. I am manipulative and I kept trying to change it but I can't, It's who I am.

72,"So the worst thing imaginable happened last night in my apartment. We found a roach. Even just typing this, my skin is crawling. 

I’ll also say this, my bf and I are pretty clean people. Things around the apartment get a bit messy from time to time, but we aren’t dirty (food, crumbs,we have a shoes off at the door policy). What has been happening recently is the duct from our portable AC has been popping out at night and will be that way for hours while we are sleeping so it’s just like having an open window. We are working on a solution for this, but our neighbors in the building have very questionable AC set ups that definitely let bugs in all the time.

So basically I feel myself going crazy after this. I don’t know what to do. I’m seeing things that aren’t there or perceiving things in a distorted way. We have some scuffs on the wall from moving in last fall (we aren’t allowed to paint) and from the corner of my eyes they look like bugs and are moving. I’m always on edge. Last night, I had to rely on pure exhaustion to pass out and go to sleep. I’m afraid to use the bathroom, organize things as it will involve moving things around and I’m afraid I’ll find another that way, go to sleep, etc. I feel physically sick. To top everything off, I’m having a nightmare finding a therapist who will accept my insurance (I’ve been searching for the last month before all I this). 

My bf is already sick of this and by this is I mean my constant anxiety. He says if we find another well worry then, but by then I’m worried it will spiral out of control. I came from a house that had an ant infestation and that was hell, but this is worse! 

To make matters worse, my bf is going away on a trip this weekend and I’m going to be alone. When I see a big bug like that I completely freeze and break down. I don’t want to get close enough to it to kill it. I don’t know what I’m going to do. Any advice on how to deal with this phobia is super appreciated.",14Jul2019,1

The smallest of inconveniences to me feel like then end of the world and could set me off to an extreme.

80,"tl;dr My friend shows increasing signs of distress but is either not aware of it or doesn't want to talk. How can I help him?

I have known my friend Chris for only 4 years, but we have a strong friendship. In all these years he was a bastion of calm. He is an optimistic, relaxed, down-to-earth kinda guy, nothing could shatter him. 

Half a year ago he started to become noticeably more attached and clingy. He wants to see me every day, keeps telling me what a good friend I am, insists on hugging me very often. I happily do this for him, I was actually the more affective one in our friendship. But this clinginess is something I had when I was in a very bad place.

Two weeks ago he started talking to himself. E.g., he sits at my side, we drink coffee and when there is a break in conversation, he has a very distant look on his face (looking into nowhere), his head is turned downwards and he moves his lips and nods like he is talking but he doesn't make a sound. He does this so often by now, that I am really worried.

I told him my observation and he said it is just stress at work. It can't be just that. We work together. His stress symptoms appeared much earlier than his new job responsibilities.

Maybe it has to do with his former best friend Tom. He doesn't like to talk much about him, though. Half a year ago Chris broke his friendship of 14 years with Tom. Yesterday we met Tom at a party and as long as Tom was there, Chris was talking to himself again. He stopped, when Tom left the party. I asked Chris if he was okay but he wasn't even aware of it. The timing fits. But Chris is either not aware that this is taking a toll on him or he doesn't want to talk about it.

I am very worried. Is there anything I can do to help him?",14Jul2019,3
81,"**tl;dr: Had a persecutory delusion where an imaginary stalker named Charlotte was out to get me. What might cause this? Not trying to self-diagnose, I just want to make sense of things.**

&amp;#x200B;

Let me start out by saying that I have never been to therapy or talked to a mental health professional. However, I have dealt with issues (which I will expand upon) regarding mental health, but have been unable to seek treatment.

&amp;#x200B;

So, about a year ago, I dealt with mood swings where I would switch between being really happy and really sad for no reason. I also dealt with a persecutory delusion. A year later, though, these symptoms have not returned. Though I still have mood swings, they're not as strong and are caused by external stimuli. Plus, I don't experience that extreme ""happiness"" anymore, I'm mostly just neutral or sad.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where things get weird. I believed that I was being stalked by a girl named Charlotte. I had never met anyone who closely resembled her, or even had the same name. I couldn't actually see or hear her, except I believed she was real. She even appeared in my nightmares, and I knew exactly what she looked like. During these dreams, she even talked to me. It was as if she were a real person, except I never actually saw her in real life. 

&amp;#x200B;

To clarify, I had the delusion that I was being stalked by a mysterious person before I ""met"" Charlotte. It was in my dreams that she finally ""revealed herself"" as my stalker.

83,"Long story short, I moved from CA to NM back in 2012 due to a work related episode. Long waiting times as a trucker then, coupled with no pay for waiting caused me to explode on shipping personnel. Cops were called and I was hauled into a psych facility, possibly in lieu of the local jail, for a 72. This occurred in Nov 2011. It immediately followed myself getting fired from that trucking job and subsequently bouncing from trucking outfit, to trucking outfit between Nov and February.

I got out of the truck and went back into security between Feb 2012 and July 2012. My dad was getting tired of me living at his house, so I perused for local trucking gigs in other states and subsequently took on a gig in eastern NM. 

Between moving here in 2012 and up to today, I never experienced any serious outbreaks of anger like the one in CA. But this afternoon, I was told to move my truck back from the line after waiting for several hours parked behind an outbuilding. I blew up on this young truck pusher (people who drive trucks into receiving bays and around the yard), and felt about as angry as I did during that incident that had the cop's called on me back in 2011. 

But, instead of escalating, cooler heads prevailed and I was kind of moved up front. No one else heard our exchange and didn't see anything too menacing due to our distance from the main building. I apologized to the guy and he seemed reasonable about it. I mean, he was following the rules and I was getting impatient. 

All that said, I thought I was over that level of petty anger. But it just reared it's ugly head again. I don't know if it's the low pay from the job and bills getting too me. Or if I'm just getting burned out. All in all, I'm bothered by the whole thing and wouldn't want it to happen again. I just can't ""up and move"" like I did the first time.

I tend to over think things a little whilst I feel like this too so I thought it'd be good to read what other people have to say about the topic. 

We've already spoke about making future plans and staying in contact and I'm certain they'll happen, but yeah, I just can't knock this weird feeling of being a little empty.",14Jul2019,1

I just started therapy after I have been suffering from (not yet formally diagnosed, but I’m literally the textbook case for these things) PTSD, either depression or some other kind of mood disorder, and anxiety/panic disorder.

After dealing with these things for as long as I can remember due to a traumatic upbringing, and never getting help for it before, I almost feel like seeing a therapist at this point is moot.
I’ve only had a consultation with my new therapist so far, where I talked about a basic outline of my life/my past/why I am the way I am/what I want to do about it, and my first real appointment is in a couple days.

I guess I feel pretty overwhelmed because I don’t even know where to begin. Do I talk about my current problems? Do I talk about my past problems, because my past problems are the reason why I’m having my current problems? Do I talk about the way that I feel that day, or do I talk about the way I usually feel? Do I talk about my current most pressing problem, or do I talk about the all the things in the past that have piled up over the years which directly caused me to have my current problems? There’s just so much to go over, and it’s such a huge mess of issues and negativity that I feel hopeless. I don’t see how anybody except me could understand my full situation, because I’ve been dealing with all of it for my entire life. My problems didn’t recently “develop”, I’ve been fucked up since day one. I feel like there’s no hope for me.

Mental illness can leave you feeling isolated and alone, thinking that few people understand and that everyone is judging you. We internalize stigma, and there is a tremendous stigma around dealing with mental health. We are afraid to talk about it. But that doesn’t have to be the case.

A few years ago, I broke my neck and back in a suicide attempt. It came after years of frustration with my own mental illness, and several previous suicide attempts. I’ve always been outspoken about my mental health, and I decided, as I was in recovery, that all I wanted to do was use my personal experience to give back to others so that they could avoid the hardships and struggles that I went through. At least then I will feel like it all meant something. I spent years in and out of hospitals, up and down with episodes, and pulled out of school, unable to work. Many of those hospitalizations were traumatic, and have left me with a lingering fear of being hospitalized. But I’ve done a number of different types of therapy, including electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and my life has improved significantly from the state I was in a few years ago as a result. My medication is finally steady, though I’ve tried basically everything out there. I have been around.

When I was younger, I found solace in chatrooms and on forums dedicated to mental health. Today, now that chat platforms like Discord are making a comeback, I wanted to incorporate this technology into our outreach, catering to people struggling with emotional issues or mental illness. Having an understanding community can be very powerful, so a community full of people with common experiences can help people feel less isolated and lonely. Learning from others can also lessen the anxiety of the situation when going through something new and scary. My idea was to create a space in which like-minded individuals could share experiences with one another without fear of stigma or judgement. Who better to seek advice from than someone who has been there themselves and come out the other side?

The Haven is a mental health support Discord server that I started July 15, 2017 in an attempt to tackle some of these issues. Since then we have become a nonprofit (501c3) organization, with the long term goal of funding mental healthcare for members in need. The server is run by a team of volunteers who spend from 20-60+ hours a week moderating. All support, which is offered in private channels in either a one to one or group setting, is offered by volunteers; any member of the server can offer support. When I started The Haven my intention was to lean on the power of peer support. I think talking to professionals is wonderful and can be very helpful, but not everyone has access to a professional or wants to talk to one, so only us citizens of the internet. Identifying with someone else, finding another person dealing with similar issues, has always made me feel less crazy, so I hoped that introducing people to one another would help as well.

After almost two years The Haven has reached 5200 members and has a lively, kind, and supportive community of folks. I always said that if everything I went through could help just one person that I would be satisfied. Well, I achieved that goal but there's so much more to do. This is a start.

97,"Since the past year my life has gone downhill. I lost friends, went off antidepressants to go back on stimulants for my ADHD and started self-medicating with benzos as I was increasingly stressed out and depressed during a stressful time. I was kindling the benzos and my emotions were all over the place once I quit, I had bursts of severe anxiety and possibly hypomania. 

I don't want to get into too much detail, but in the past in childhood I had some symptoms that could possibly indicate to schizophrenia and I feel like my family pointed that out when my therapist when they saw me struggling. But now many months later I started realizing that I don't feel right. I've been very anhedonic and internally restless, as if I'm on antipsychotic medication (tried them once). Drugs don't affect me anymore, I've been struggling hard to keep myself entertained and I just feel like the opposite of what my ADHD meds should do.

The realization that I do not know myself creeps up on me a lot and I feel like I just do everyday things just because I have to. I have very little feeling when I do things, I lack motivation, and I’m still able to enjoy certain things but not for an extended time before I go back in this weird headspace where I kind of just think that I’m here but not really here. Like I feel as if I have no purpose in life other than taking up the Earth’s resources (but not in a suicidal way, more of in a philosophical way) and I just can’t see a true identity for myself. Sometimes I’ll randomly be doing schoolwork and just get so frustrated and overwhelmed that I break down and cry. I’ll be in the shower and get mild anxiety attacks when I think back to how I used to be younger and I could actually feel present in a moment. I tend to start bickering with my boyfriend a lot and feel absolutely nothing. I get irritated at little things like my roommate asking me to do something (but I don’t show it; I tend to be a very kind person to people but am irritated on the inside and just want to scream). Is this just anxiety/depression or something more? I feel like it has to be more, I can’t stop feeling like I’m not myself and I often do things where I feel completely unpresent in the moment, and in life.

Problem is, they never ever ever tidy or clean. Which sounds stupid to get annoyed over. My mental health has been so good lately because I’ve been in a clean and tidy space. My mind feels so much clearer and I can think straight when things are organised. And that’s how I’ve been stable for so long (depression and acute generalised anxiety) so I’m really struggling  to have clear thoughts and to  feel organised and motivated.

104,"Hey just need an opinion. For some background I have been going to therapy for a year now for an array of problems and family issues. One of them being the relationship with my mother which hasn't been the best to put it that way but a recent illness in the family has really got everyone on edge. I have had a really hard time showing and sharing my feelings about it to the people I'm most comfortable (not family but mental health professionals and friends )because of the impact it has had, especially on my mother. 

So now to get to the question am I  over reacting by getting emotional when my mom remarks on like "" well im sorry that so and so is ill"" while we are having a small argument. Im used to arguments a lot and the argument it self doesn't get me emotional, it's the way she says the remarks on the illness that makes me feel like I'm not aware of the impact it has had on her and the pressure she is under. The remarking while arguing makes me feel like shit. I'm used to her jumping to conclusions in arguments but remarking on the illness is really hurting me.
 
English isn't my first language but I have tried my best to get the message across and I'm not sure if the illness remarks make any sense but putting it simply the bringing of the illness in to an argument that has nothing to do with it really makes me emotional. Am I over reacting by getting emotional?",14Jul2019,1
105,"Sometimes I think about death and free will. It disturbs me that all I have known will end and it also disturbs me that everything I do is probably just a result of microscopic cellular interactions. I feel like I am making choices but really my mind has already supplied me the thoughts I will have and is probably the cause of what I am writing now. I believe that everything I do is just a reaction to stimuli that I had nothing to do with. Every thought I have is supplied to me by cellular interactions. Every feeling and reaction I have determined by my genetics. Every decision I make FEELS like a deliberation but since every part of my thought process is determined for me, I have to conclude that the final choice to make a decision is outside of my control as well 

Whether you believe that or not, I can't shake it. I don't want to die and I don't want to believe that everything I do is determined for me. But I know I will die and I believe that I don't have free will (in the sense of not actually making decisions). 

I don't know what you all believe but this thinking has put a dark cloud over my life. I have struggled with chronic depression since I was in middle school and am not almost 27. But this kind of thinking has caused me to feel this sense of disassociation that is really awful. When I talk with my partner, my brain keeps fixating on the fact that I will lose her someday whether I die or she dies first. I hate both of those thoughts and they make me sick. I also look at people and think about myself and I can't shake the feeling that we are all just robots, albeit with programming that resulted more from a series of genetic accidents than because some conscious entity programmed us. 

I just hate feeling this way. I hate thinking about this stuff. I don't want to burden people I know because I don't want them to peak behind the curtain and potentially suffer the same existential horror I am suffering. So I am asking if any of you have any words of encouragement or advice. Anything is welcome. 

Another note: part of my depression may be particularly bad now because of my medication. I have been taking Wellbutrin for about 2.5 weeks and it sometimes makes me feel okay, sometimes makes me feel nothing, and sometimes makes me feel really depressed. It is hard to know whether these thoughts would have made me feel this way regardless or if these thoughts wouldn't have affected me as severely if the medication was working better or if I wasn't on it.

Last note: I have been trying to practice mindfulness when my mind starts to loop and obsess over something painful. It seems to help me to not try to ""solve"" thoughts that are temporarily unsolvable. Sometimes going from a ""doing"" mode, where you try to solve a problem, to a ""being"" mode, where you merely try to observe what is happening in the present without judgement, can help stop repetitive, racing thoughts. Even so, I still appreciate any help you all are willing to give me.",14Jul2019,2

I'm about to start my second year of university. I've wanted to go to med school for as long as I can remember - my ultimate goal is to join Doctors Without Borders, in addition to working/volunteering at clinics in low-income/high-risk communities (especially on a reserve). I was diagnosed with depression a few years ago after a suicide attempt but I was still high-functioning and able to balance a 95% average and a series of extracurriculars throughout high school. However, in my first year of uni I'm not sure what happened but suddenly I was getting hit with extreme depressive episodes once every few weeks. I'd literally spend two weeks in bed, lucky if I showered, brushed my teeth, or ate non-junk food. My worst episode happened at the end of last November and caused me to miss all of my final exams, driving me to a few suicide attempts. This pushed me into getting medication and going into therapy, but though the episodes have gotten slightly better and less frequent (ie. I can brush my teeth regularly but can't shower or leave) they're still very much negatively impacting my life. I've had to drop all my extracurriculars because I couldn't be relied upon to attend meetings and meet deadlines, but I was still able to maintain a 4.0 GPA although my numerical average has dropped. 

I'm just wondering if there's anyone else who's been in a similar situation - I really don't see how I can ever hold down a job, let alone get into med school, if I'm this unreliable. My therapist says that the episodes may not ever go away, and honestly that fucking terrifies me. I hate that my depression can so easily take away everything I've worked for - it's like a constant ""reset"" button gets hit and I'm back where I started, only worse, while everyone else keeps moving ahead. Is there anything more I can do? My medication is already maximized for my situation, I've been putting a shit-ton of effort into therapy, I'm eating healthy and engaging in daily light exercise. I really don't want to give up my dream because then I'd be both letting myself down and giving in to my mental illness, but I really don't see how this situation is tenable long-term.

Terribly sorry if this is confusing. It's confusing for me too.

Has anyone ever felt like they make others feel uncomfortable? like there presence alone was overwhelming? its hard to explain but its like invisible tension that only comes when you're around others? Doesn't matter if they're family, friends or strangers but you still feel it. 


When I'm alone I barely feel the tension but when I'm in a coffee shop doing my thing I feel the tension. I look around and I locate where I feel it's coming from. It's usually from the people closest to me. When I look in that direction/person I feel like my vision has weight and actually causes a tic/jerk in that person. This has been going on for the past 10 years and I need thoughts/ideas.

I always see others sitting beside other people comfortably (coffee shops, theaters..etc) but it's so uncomfortable for me to be around others.

I was the epitome of hyperactive ADHD and born into a generation that was heavily diagnosed and treated, but no one had ever suggested that I had ADHD. I was just punished for being myself.

  Recently, I've encountered a strange issue.  My b/f's friend, ""R"" is a constant one - upper, interrupter, and has recently added mental illness to the list of topics that they ""own"".  A group of us were talking about medications we were on, stuff we weren't on any more etc.  It was nice conversation - everyone was sharing.  Then ""R"", starts talking over everyone.  She then says that she ""remembers when (my dose)"" used to work for them.  But that their trauma is so severe that they need all of these high doses.  This person knows nothing about my history - however, they always seem to think that they are the worse off of everyone in the room.  I find it maddening and my other friends are also annoyed by it.

I've tried to talk to R about it before, but haven't had success - they do not seem to catch cues.  I am not interested in offending this person, however, I am not interested in having my experiences dismissed whenever she happens to be around.

Even now at 18 nothing’s changed and I’ve accepted that this is essentially it for me. Nothing will make me happy nothing will interest me. I’m completely numb inside and out. I’m planning on killing myself by the time I’m 19. I just need a place where no one will find me. The only time I’ve felt euphoric was a few years back when I was on a carnival ride and I felt like I was gonna die. That’s what made me happy. It’s weird, when people don’t want to die they’re always worried everything will kill them. But when you do want to die it feels like death takes too long because nothing will kill you but time. I’ve felt done with my life since I was ten but now I’m more sure of it.",14Jul2019,56
