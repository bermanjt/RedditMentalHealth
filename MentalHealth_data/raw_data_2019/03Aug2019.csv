0,"I have been for a while. I can't remember a time where I wasn't. 

Currently, I'm attending college and have to work part-time (full time in the summers) to pay for it. I've been exhausted ever since I started, and have found recently that my depression started to get worse again due to feeling like I am overloaded with stuff to do. I've been binge eating to deal with the stress for the past 3 years, and have probably gained around 50lbs since starting school. I don't know how to stop, and I feel like I'm no longer in control of this aspect in my life. I have no clue where to start in order to return back to my 'normal', where I can find the energy to go to the gym, eat right, have happier thoughts, etc.",03Aug2019,1
1,"First post here. Not gonna write a book here so keeping it short. Been depressed for a long ass time, some events led to a couple of emotions dying off. I still have empathy for people and would feel sad if for instance and old man fell and hurt himself. But sometimes I enjoy someone getting killed that I don't like, I enjoy them being tortured and molested. And with women, I love to watch some women getting beaten, the ones that pull a tough ego centric behavior and some in general. But I really have deep emotions for people and even romantic or platonic love sometimes. I know I have been physically and mentally abused but I don't think it's coming from there since I consider myself a strong person and I am glad I went through some shit that made me tougher. Mostly I fucking hate people, but when something bad happens to elderly or kids I feel some remorse. What is my problem?",03Aug2019,0
2,"Ok so get the title, I feel like a teenager, I lack things that make me a better person, not just those, strictness, discipline, communication, being a bro, you see, I have no Hook so to say, I just try to be who I am not, and in return get fucked, i've been fucked more times then a broad in an allyway, im talking bigtime, fucks that fuck your life up, damn, you see, I got lied to by my \*friends, and they tried to kill me afterwards that fucked with my brain abit, so my logic is a bit off, nahh my logic is like a fukin anvil-bring in the metal for me to hammer, you know Im a fucking sissy about it, so what it happened, alot of shit happened because of it, and i still cling on to it fuck me, i let that shit go, and ofcourse now i need experience to be me everywheeere, cause damn i feel like a bro, but never show it what the fuck kind of logic is that :D fuck that",03Aug2019,1
3,"Does anyone else experience this?

Lately I've been having this issue where I can't tell my dreams apart from reality.. it could be something major or something incredibly small such as this:
I gave my two week notice in at work recently and sent an email to my boss asking what she would like for me to do with the keys. I don't remember dreaming about work but I clearly remember getting an email back from her that was uncharacteristically rude and short but when I checked in the emails there was nothing from her.
The same thing happened with thinking me we had someone over to cut the grass in our front yard though we never talked about it and I don't remember dreaming of it, I just went outside to walk the dog and saw the grass and was confused and disoriented for a little while..
It's happening more and more frequently now and I'm not sure what to do with it..",03Aug2019,1
4,"I'm about two sessions from the end of this round of therapy, it's been no help what-so-ever - I was very clear about wanting CBT but I feel I've not had this at all, despite changing therapist half way through to try to get appropriate care, it's always just been small talk which is no help! 

Once this round is over it's a 6 month wait until I can re-refer, then the waiting list to be seen once you refer yourself is around 9 months - it may be longer for me as options in therapists are more limited, removing those who I've already seen.

I can't take antidepressants. 

To me this feels like I have absolutely no mental health care for over a year - I'm severely depress and suicidal, this doesn't feel right at all and surely there just be something else available? 

I rarely see my GP, since switching to the surgery I think I've only seen a doctor there once and that was over a year ago. I'm anxious about going to them over this because I suspect they will just shrug their shoulders and say there's no other help for me, they won't understand that I can't take antidepressants, or last time they called crisis team but just couldn't seem to grasp that they were not useful to me (I've no way to contact crisis team, I also have no idea what they do but suspect they'd be of little use to be anyway). 

I'd like to approach my GP with ideas, if there's anything else via the NHS I could raise with them. Does anyone have any ideas?",03Aug2019,3
5,"I feel so lost. Idk who I am anymore. I don't know what I stand for, who my friends are. I've been feeling this way since I started uni, and after breaking with my gf last September I'm just not the same person. I miss who I was then. I was happy, I was in love and was just so happy being. But it's been nearly a year and I still feel empty. One of the main factors is I became a Christian in order to be with this girl. I tricked myself into believing it to be with her, but the fact is I changed who I was completely. My friends commented saying your not this why are you doing this. I stopped going to church after we broke up. But who am I if I can change my Morales so quickly. I stand for nothing. I will sell my soul for the next best thing it seems... idk why I wrote this..

9,"So, a few months ago, I had a pretty awful experience with a hospital close to my college.

Here’s the full story. My friend called the EMTs on my campus one night because I appeared severely intoxicated to the point of not being able to move/speak/see. Once they came, they decided my vitals weren’t good enough and that I wasn’t responsive enough, so they had an ambulance take me to the default hospital my college sends students.

There, the hospital left me in a bed for the whole stay and did nothing. No vital checks. No blood tests. No questions about what happened that night. I left a few hours later still pretty disoriented.

Flash forward to the next day. There were reports that date rape drugs were used against multiple women on my campus the past 2 weekends. I find out the one guy I talked to while I had my last drink of the night has a rape record, and that his brother has drugged girls before.

I go back to the hospital I had been sent to and ask for a drug test for Ketamine, since I was told that that was the drug other women on my campus had been tested positive for.

The nurse who “took care of me” was rude and said she didn’t understand why I was getting a drug test because “it doesn’t change what happened that night.” She yelled at me some more, I started crying. Regardless, though, I told her I wanted my urine sample to be tested for Ketamine, and she assured me it would be.

The hospital, however, did not ever test my urine for Ketamine. Even though my records at the hospital state otherwise. They said over the phone it was never sent to the lab they were supposed to send it to - the lab that could test for Ketamine (their facility can only run a standard drug test that does not include Ketamine or any other date rape drug).

By now, it had been more than a week later since the incident and when I gave my urine sample. They said they would retest it again for Ketamine, but, because there was so little urine left, it was likely to come back negative.

It has been several months since this happened, and I still am dealing with feelings of guilt, insecurity, anger, and sadness about all of this. I still wonder if I had been overreacting this whole time. I still blame myself by saying I was just too drunk.

I know that that night was suspicious: the symptoms match eerily, I even managed to say “I can’t breathe” before I collapsed for the third time. The guy I talked to went out of his way to sit next to me, converse for a very short time while I had my drink out in the open, and immediately stop talking once people he knew came over. He has raped people before. His brother has drugged and raped girls before.

But, I will never know. And, it kills me.

I guess I’m just looking for some support, some advice, some validation that it is ok to feel this way. I think about it so much, despite how more and more time has passed, and it haunts me with guilt.",03Aug2019,1
10,I was recently diagnosed and am attending therapy. What should I expect?,03Aug2019,5
11,"I don’t know if this is the right place for this kinda thing, but I have to start somewhere I suppose 

Me and my current girlfriend had a good, positive, healthy sex life for a good long time until suddenly one day I found myself suddenly deeply deeply uncomfortable with anything sexually. Panicky, almost. Repulsed ... reviled, like me skin is gonna start crawling. And it all kinda clicked out of nowhere, with nothing obvious being a trigger. (Note, the repulsion is about me and my personal image, I feel a similar way when I am complimented physically as well which started around the same time). 

I have struggled, and continue to struggle, with depression and anxiety, and have an interesting history to explain which I will get to ... 

But basically it causes some issues for how i feel and how we interact. The relationship aspect is significant but I am looking more for advice on how I myself can get over this as opposed to relationship advice per se. 

I associate part of it with weight gain, which makes me feel incredibly uncomfortable with myself. I’m not massive, but I put on about 15, maybe 20kg, which I tend to end up doing when going through periods of stress. It kinda ends up spiralling to a point where I’m going out in big jackets in the summer 25-30 degree heat, but the horrendous discomfort of the heat is preferable to how i feel without the ... ‘shield’ of these extra layers I guess). I cannot let my girlfriend see me like this, I have considered trying to make myself but I just get ... well I can’t. 

I want to get a way past it, but unfortunately things between Us don’t make it much easier. My inability to comfortably partake in sex makes her feel unwanted and rejected, which I can understand. Unfortunately the dynamic leads to me feeling like I have a responsibility to push through it for her, which is in no way her doing, but it is something we have discussed and she has a huge deal of difficulty understanding. The result is that I intentionally, if not willingly, partake in certain things even though I really don’t want to because I hate to see how she feels if she thinks she is unwanted etc. It’s terribly unhealthy of me, I know, and it makes me feel a whole lot worse about it all too. Which is why I am trying to do something about it, in part anyway. 

I had a partner in the past that had spiralled into an abusive relationship, and I was pressured into having sex with her even though I didn’t want to. It was a mutually negative situation, I think - I was a bit of an arsehole too, in hindsight, though not in a sexual nature. It was around this time that I first put on weight, actually, and then lost it again. So there’s kinda a link there. 

The other possibly relevant information is my younger brothers’ father, my ex-step father. He was psychologically  abusive and, after my mum finally managed to get rid of him and he was seeing my brothers at his house once or twice a week, the youngest of them all told me that his father had been touching him inappropriately and doing certain things to him - he was 3 at the time, and not old enough to understand this properly. It later turned out he had done the same thing to the other two, when they were a similar age. The thing is, I’m fairly sure nothing of this sort ever happened to me - I was 6 when my mum met him and I have absolutely no memory of any such events. I still feel it is probably relevant, so I’m mentioning it just in case. 


I don’t really know what I am asking here - I suppose I am hoping someone else may understand what’s going on, have some kind of knowledge on what causes these things and how to get over them. I’ve tried seeing a therapist but this is not a topic I can really make myself broach, even though I have tried. 

Again, not sure if this is the right place. So if not, well, apologies for laying this all out here, and if there is a more suitable subreddit for such things, I would really appreciate it if you could point me that way. Thanks",03Aug2019,2
12,"I have bipolar disorder and huge anxiety, and now recently overthinking. 
I always thought my overthinking was a part of my anxiety but for the past week it's been so amplified that I can't do anything without getting frustrated.
I am on treatment for all of it but I don't have a therapist, since they don't exist like that in my country. In here they just give you your medicine and send you away. 


Honestly, the thing I love to do the most in life is sleeping but now I'm scared of going to bed and not doing anything because I keep dwelling into the past and the present, having arguments with myself. It does not stop. I just can't have silence.
I talk to myself and talk talk talk and ask myself why I am talking to myself then I realize I'm still doing it so I get mad at myself then I go into all the other stuff.

Ive talked to my psychiatrist and she increased my doses and gave me sleeping pills that should make me calm and relaxed and sleepy.

It's still not working. I just stay up all night reading books or watching stuff so that my mind is busy with something other than itself. Even when I'm dying for sleep. Then I just pass out.

13,"Hey everyone! I don’t want to get overly detailed in order to protect the anonymity of my friend, but I need a little feedback on whether or not I handled this situation correctly.

A good friend of mine (who I didn’t know had any serious mental health considerations, but does see a therapist) recently went away on a work trip, and something happened which triggered him. I spoke with him for much of the day, hearing him out and being compassionate. However, at a certain point he relayed that was feeling like he had “a mental break,” and I was a bit alarmed because of other things that were said. I asked if he had any phone numbers of recent / new mental health professionals, and this shut him down completely. Something to the extent of, “I get what you’re getting at. Have a great night!” - basically implying that it seemed like I was trying to say I wasn’t interested or available to have this talk with him. I honestly just wanted him to have access to someone who knew how to help, rather than myself, who isn’t educated about these things. Since then we haven’t spoken. 

Now I’m really worried that it was tactless for me to suggest that. Was I out of line?

And if something like this happens in the future (with anyone, not just him) what should I do?

16,"First time poster here. 
The driving instructor inquired my age. When I responded with ""30"", they assumed I was from another country. I laughed it off and said ""No, this...has just been a long time coming.""
I didn't want to get into the truth RIGHT before this person was going to be riding with me. That when I was 18, I nearly lost my life after being struck by a car. I was walking back to my college dorm with a friend and we were both struck by an intoxicated driver (friend's injuries were minor thankfully). I was a freshman in college and already dealing with GAD, OCD, and MDD. I spent my Thanksgiving break alone in the hospital. I was terrified. 
I went through 3 learner's permits over the years to get where I am. Each of them expiring before I was ready to take a road test. I learned the basics and then would get caught up in my anxiety and put lessons on the back burner. This final permit, as I was approaching 30, I REALLY wanted this one to stick. Years of therapy and self-work got me further and further than I had ever been before. Further distances, more complicated routes, even learning parallel (shout out to my awesome and patient husband as my teacher). I mustered the courage to schedule a road test this time. I wasn't going to let yet another permit expire. 
My anxiety was at its peak all morning until my test...but I passed. On the first try. I've spent YEARS catering my life to other people's schedules so they can shuttle me around and/or having to rely on public transit. I've spent YEARS absolutely terrified of being behind the wheel...of possibly being responsible for injuring someone else. The immense pressure and responsibility that comes with driving was always too much to bear without flashing back to what I experienced. My experience has made me a very cautious driver and for that I'm grateful. 
Don't worry 18-year-old me, it's gonna be a long road but...we'll get there.

17,"Recently I was talking to my mom about something and she said something about my brother's ankle injury that happened 2-3 months ago. 
At the time, I couldn't remember it. At all. 
I thought long about it because it was really bothering me and after a while remembered that I was driving him around the whole time, which is pretty unusual for me since I dislike driving a lot and he loves it. Plus, we go to the same college so it was something I did every day for months. 

I started thinking more about this and realised that there was something else that happened a few years ago (2-3). At least, according to my mother. I don't remember it at all, so everything I remember is from my dad apologizing to me and my mom venting to me about it and being concerned about it. My brother and I had a disagreement with out father and he became violent. He apparently grabbed me by the neck/collar (I don't remember) and choked me a bit. He has hit me before but it has never gone that far before. Yet I don't remember a thing. I don't even remember the events that led to it, nor all the fights that happened afterwards fro months. 

Another thing I forgot and that I feel really guilty about is a friend. I don't have many friends and never had, so it shouldn't happen, no matter how inconsiderate and cold I might be. I just didn't remember them. It was at a time where I only accepted Facebook friend requests from close friends, and he was one of them. All my close friends spoke of thing we (including him) did as a group. But I don't remember at all. At the time, I didn't even remember his name. 

One thing I have noticed is that every time this has happened, it happened at a very difficult time of life. I was either depressed or very anxious and stressed.

18,"I was diagnosed with major depression and severe anxiety after attempting to kill myself and ending up in a mental hospital for two weeks.

I have moved away from my lone parent due to his deployment, and now I live alone with my barely living grandparents, who live ten hours away from my old home + college. 

I'm supposed to move to college in two weeks, and I don't know if I'm going to make it through tonight. I have my first year of college completely paid for off scholarships, but I'm still so scared to go, and I don't know what to do. I can't handle social interactions anymore, I have complete breakdowns when put in new situations. I turn 18 in four months, and then that's it, I'm all alone.

I picked up 5 new clients this week (for reference, we have trainers at the gym who have been there for months and haven’t picked up 3 new clients) worked at the gym from 4:30-10am and 4-10pm almost every day this week aside from today, and have been smashing the goals in front of me.

I decided it would be good to take some time relax tonight since I’ve only been getting roughly 3-4 hours of sleep a night for all the nights this week. 2.5 hours into relaxation and I feel like I’m starting to slack on myself. That I need to get back out there and start working again.

For reference, getting myself to the point I am now was by no means easy. It has required me to go go go nonstop. I get off at 10 at night, in bed at 11-11:30, then back up at 3:40 to repeat the process again. There were periods over the past few months where I’ve gone 4-5 days without eating so I could pay my bills. This is no longer an issue and money is no longer tight.

I am wondering if he has some sort of mental condition. Perhaps on the Autism spectrum? Here is the quirks that bother me:

I am a people person. I enjoy talking to others and am respectful. Whenever I try to call my cousin up he either hangs up or ignores the call completely. On the otherhand, he is much more open to texting me but still has some sort of avoidant personality. When I text him he seems to ignore anything I say about myself but goes on and tells me about himself. The conversation then turns into all about him and no real back and forth dialogue. He also has infatuations I would say with particular topics. He can go on about those but whenever something remotely else is brought up he wants to drop the conversation on phone or pretty much ignores me on text. Now him and I get along very well. We consider each other brothers. Whenever I am back in my hometown all he wants to do is hang out with me at any opportunity.

As part of my Masters of Psychology thesis for the University of Queensland (Australia) I am recruiting participants to complete an online questionnaire! The study aims to develop a greater understanding of the relationship  between sleep disturbances and mental health, and to examine how compassion may influence that relationship. The questionnaire takes approximately 15 minutes to complete, and the only requirements are that you are 17 years of age or older and able to read English. The survey is open to anyone world-wide and asks questions relating to sleep perceptions, sleep quality, compassionate traits, mental health symptoms and overall well-being. To our knowledge, there are no significant risks for participating in this research beyond that of everyday living.

If you are interested in participating, click on the link below to access the survey or contact me for further information.

I always feel his presence behind me when I'm walking and I care deeply about him, and prefer to be around him more than real people. Is that weird?

30,"I’m 16 and I’ve been on antidepressants for quite some time now. I was on Zoloft and now I’m on Effexor. Without going into much detail, on the antidepressants I feel zero emotion whatsoever. I can’t feel happiness, sadness, anger, literally nothing. I also lost most of my empathy. I feel like a zombie. If I ween off the medication and eventually stop, will I start feeling emotion again? Or is this just how I’m going to be for the rest of my life.",03Aug2019,4
31,"I've never posted anything like this so bear with me, please. 

I feel like I am an emotional, mentally insane mess. I honestly don't know where to even start. I am not even quite sure if I came to the right place to vent. 

My mental health is not good. I can never be continuously one emotion. I feel bipolar, I feel depressed, I feel suicidal, I feel like I am everything but ""good, happy, content"". I don't know if I'm just beating myself up too much or if I'm trying to recognize my wrongs and try to make them right. I'm in between trying to figure myself out or just going along with life's crazy ride of adulthood. 

Why do I feel like I need a doctor to figure me out? Is it because I'm not capable of pulling myself out of this shithole as I have before? There are no words to describe the number of depressive thoughts I have go through my head. It feels like I have to squeeze the positivity out of everything I do.

32,"I'm scared to tell my therapist all that goes on in my head. I don't know why? I'm seeing him to get help. But I've told him the basics. I was sexually abused at 6, I've been bullied my whole life by my sister and brothers, I let people use me because I don't want them to get mad at me, Ext. And he has said he thinks I have dissociation. Idk it usually only happens when I have sex, or when something stressful happens. But I start to space out. My limbs get weak, my face and finger tips gets numb. And my vision gets blurred/just weird looking. lately it's been happening for no reason though! I know when it starts to happen but after it stops my memory of what happened during slowly starts to fade. Not all the way though I remember like fragments of parts. And that scares me! I guess the reason why I'm hesitant to tell him, is because all my life I've been told that ""oh stop, your just looking for attention"". I'm afraid he's not gonna believe me. I guess I'm also afraid to know what's wrong. Idk, I also get these weird feelings towards my boyfriend. Like I'll love him one day. Then the next I don't really feel anything for him? It's really confusing! I hate it! I hate me!  I can just feel everything getting worse. I'm really scared because even if it is what I think it is. I don't want it to be! I don't wanna be crazy! I don't want all these different opinions/feeling going through me!",03Aug2019,1

Anyway, I just feel really stupid nowadays. It all keeps adding up. And I think that people keep really disliking me because of my slowness - it's a pain to work around, and I feel like I literally never can just have a good time with people because I'm always struggling to keep up in conversations or whatever we're doing. Today I even spoke without thinking and ruined this surprise party thing and I'm so embarrassed, I just wished I had never joined because I feel like it all would have been better without me.

I don't know how to deal with feeling so down on myself so much. I live in a pretty well-educated area, so it's hard to see how my quality of life is comparing to people who just function better. I literally at this point can ""feel"" how my brain is so dull and quiet compared to others - like it just usually feels kind of silent and empty and meanwhile others talk about of racing thoughts and how they can't fall asleep because they're thinking so much but I fall asleep like a log and can't wake up...",03Aug2019,2
34,"My name is Karizma and I'm 17. There's so much bad things in my head and so much wrong with me and I just want to know what it is that's wrong with me, but I know if I tell any professional they'll just send me to some mental hospital. I don't want to go there I just want to know what's going on with me so I suppose I'll tell you a little bit about what's going on to give you guys an idea. To start off I can't really talk well I've tried to tell my parents about what's going on before but because I can't really talk well they never understand and blow it off like it's nothing. I can think of what I want to say in my head no problem and it sounds perfect but it's like only a few words actually make it to my mouth and none of it comes out right. I can text and write letters explaining just fine but when I tried that my parent wouldn't listen and just wanted me to speak to them even when I told them I can't use my voice and I can write or text better. Also it's like I have a constant war going on in my head I'm constantly talking to myself in my head going back and forth arguing about really bad things. Sometimes it's me fighting the voice with him trying to get me to kill myself or someone else but I keep telling him no and it's 24/7 wether it's that or something else he's just always in there telling me to do bad things or thinking terrible things. Sometimes it gets so bad where I can't do anything but lay in bed hitting my own head just trying to get him to stop talking. Another thing is sometimes I don't have control over my body. When I'm in the car at times my body will try to take off my seatbelt and throw myself out of the car so I have to physically hold myself back. Other times it's grabbing something to just stab someone or just hurt someone. Something else that goes on in my head is I find pleasure in these thoughts I enjoy the thought of me torturing other people killing them I enjoy other people's pain when people die it makes me happy. No matter how close they may be to me their death doesn't phase me I just laugh at it. The final thing I want to mention is my memory. I can't really remember anything ever happening and I mean everything. Even typing any of this I can't remember any of it. I know I typed it but I have zero recollection of me ever doing it. Constantly I wonder how I got somewhere it's almost like waking up somewhere and having no idea how you got there. A good way of have of explaining it is when I mow the lawn and I look back at all that I have mowed I don't understand how it's all mowed down because I can't remember me doing that I know I mowed it because there's no other explanation but I can't remember ever doing it. It's like that with everything I can't remember doing anything.

36,"trigger warning, mentioning suicide. self harm, all that fun stuff. 

My sister is 16, and has been in and out of hospitals since she was around 12. In July she got hospitalized for her 6th time. My dad (who she lives with) does not set boundaries for her. She’s allowed to skip school if she wants, she can hang out with friends unsupervised (which is normally fine, but she was 2 days out of the hospital, left unsupervised), he buys her razors and doesn’t watch her with them (the hospital said her self harm was the worst they’ve ever seen). He doesn’t see the OBVIOUS signs of an eating disorder, and doesn’t make her go to therapy or take her meds. She had psychosis symptoms a couple years back. And she didn’t even recognize me. So she NEEDS those meds. It’s not that he doesn’t care, it’s that he’s convinced she’s trying to get better (every time you ask him, he says her will to get better is so strong and better than anything else) And I don’t think he knows how to handle her. He literally buys her whatever she wants. Which leaves him with no money for the debt he’s in, and for school or whatever for me (that’s another story). But he’s just enabling her to get worse. She doesn’t want to live with my mom because she knows my mom will make her go to school, tell her no sometimes etc. She literally kicked a crack in my moms windshield because my mom told her no to something she wanted. 

My dad literally won’t listen to doctors or the other members in my family. And I hate to say it, but she’s gonna die. Unless things magically turn around, she will. My cousins, and I still invite her to things but that’s not going to fix everything. I have my own issues so I can’t do my parents job for them. I need to focus on myself. But I’m very worried. Does anyone have any suggestions? ): My aunt and I have been talking about having an intervention type thing for my dad and just tell him bluntly to get it together. But I have little hope in that working. We’ve all tried to say stuff in the past. So yeahhh. Ofc if she were to say anything to me that was worrisome, I’d immediately report it. But what if she doesn’t? 

TLDR; my sister is very mentally ill and my dad is enabling her poor behaviour and making her health worse. And I think she’s going to commit suicide at some point as a result.",03Aug2019,4
37,"I think I have trauma that stems from the death of my father when I was 6. He had a stroke when I was younger and then had lung cancer. Before he died, he attempted to commit suicided in front if me my brother, sister, cousin, aunt, and mother. I vividly remember him writing in want to die on the wall with an eraser. I remember me and my siblings and cousin watching him write a suicide note. He tried to stab himself in the stomach and I remember hiding the silverware with my sister and brother. 
I still cry over his death but not over the sad memories only the happy ones, I miss them so much. 

I’m 16 now and my mother never lets me leave the house. Unless it’s for something school related.  I desperately want to talk to someone about what I’m going through. I’ve taken dozens of mental health “test” most of them say I have chronic loneliness and other test list  bipolar depression.  I want a mental heath screening. But I don’t know how to ask my mother.

40,"After a suicide attempt last year which landed me in a psych ward, I was put on risperidone and Prozac. It worked. I haven't felt depressed for the past year and I rarely feel anxious anymore. I can actually talk to people easily now. My brain and heart are no longer obscured by a black fog. I don't feel empty anymore. 

Then I noticed how blank I was feeling all the time. I felt nothing and I started to miss having emotions. It wasn't the emptiness of depression, because I do feel whole... I just feel FLAT, textureless. Boring. No creativity. And as frustrating as that was, I couldn't even FEEL frustrated about it, because I can't feel anything at all. I started wanting to come off my meds just so I could feel again, even though I knew what a gamble that would be.

Then I looked back, closely, at my behaviour over the past year. As an example, I used to be an irritable person and would respond coldly and snappishly when I was irritated by something. I always despised that about myself. I want to be a chill, calm person and that is not what my behaviour reflected. I realised, with disappointment, that even though I do not experience irritation anymore, I *still respond the same way to things that I know I ""should"" find annoying*. That behaviour is still present. What's most disturbing is that that behaviour is SO ingrained in me that not even the all-encompassing numbness from meds has gotten rid of it. Something that I thought was a symptom of depression was really just... me. 

For some reason I had thought that meds were going to magically fix me and make me a better person. But that's not what they're for. I am still the same person as before - I'm just not depressed anymore. I still don't like a lot of things about myself. 

I realised that in the past year I have not done ANY work on myself. I was so entranced by the lack of depression that had plagued me for years that I didn't even stop to think that there is still much more work to be done. It made me complacent, thinking that now the suffering has been solved, everything has been solved. But that's not true. 

There was always an entire human being underneath the pain, and now that the pain is gone, I can safely and objectively sift through all the shit. I have no choice now but to confront it. I was blinded to it, but now I can see everything that was always there, everything I don't like about myself that needs to be dealt with. 

So yeah... just a reminder for those who may be struggling right now. The work doesn't stop. Meds just make it easier to sort all that underlying stuff out. But it's GOOD to have that work to do! Working on yourself and learning to understand who you really are - and *accept* and love yourself - is a noble task.",03Aug2019,1

42,"Those are the words of my 9 year old son. Words he spoke the other day because he misses his 17 year old cousin who died by suicide 16 months ago. He wants to see her. Words I now carry with me every moment of every day. 

I was there that morning. I arrived right after the police. It was like a scene in a movie. Emergency lights flashed from every direction. I left my car in the middle of the road, door open, pushed past all the police in the street, and ran into the house. 

Looking back on that day I can see myself as if I was watching from above. My sister and her husband were inconsolable.  Police everywhere. The screams, and tears. All the phone calls. It’s such a blur. But what is clear are the moments I was able to sit with her before she was taken away. The quiet in her room was deafening. I wanted it all to stop. I wanted to turn back the clock. To have one more chance. As I sat there the realization hit me like wave. Everything had changed. I couldn’t stop it. Nothing would ever be the same again. My niece... she was gone. 

It’s been sixteen months and no one has “moved on”.  It’s something we carry with us every day. It’s part of all of us. That loss, the grief, the anger and disbelief. It makes every step harder to make and every breath harder to take. 

My niece was in pain. Blinding pain. I sat on the front steps that morning and read the note she left. 10 pages of writing as the drugs took effect. She was more afraid of waking up then dying. Those were her exact words!  She was only two months shy of 18, yet she couldn’t see the light her future held. Any hope she had gathered over time had slipped through her fingers. She couldn’t hold on any longer. 

I’m grateful that her pain has stopped but I wish she could have seen or felt the love she was leaving behind. The devastation that has ripped through our family is the result of the tremendous love we all felt for her.  She was our light. She brought so much joy to us all. Yet she struggled to feel any herself. 

Life will never be the same. People tell you that things will get better in time. A big part of me wants to scream that I don’t want everything to be ok because it’s not.  We’re not and never will be. We’re all a mess. My kids still struggle every day.  She was a regular part of their life. She loved them unconditionally and them her. How do you explain why this disease could take her away and why we couldn’t help her.  They are too young to have to deal with anxiety and depression, and loss. 

What I wouldn’t give for another chance to reach her. Knowing the pain she was in crushed my soul. She had the most beautiful heart. If only she could have felt how loved she was. 

If you are struggling with depression or thinking about suicide, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE reach out for help. You are not alone. You deserve to feel love and happiness. You might not feel it or see it right now but there are people who care, who see your worth, who understand your pain, and want to help.  You can even confidentially call or text counselors who can help. I posted the link below.

43,"Last Tuesday my therapist at the end of our session said;
""Well, I think we have sort of reached all that we can.. I think it's a better idea we stop meeting."" It wasn't exactly that but worded very close. She didn't ask how I felt and I'm fucking unstable as hell and she just sorta in my mind threw me out. I have absolutely no medication, or any support and I don't know what to do now. I'm expected to go back to school in less then a few months and I got pretty close to killing myself. I really want to fucking kill myself, it's getting worse. Homicidal urges too. Close to fucking killing off my entire family and myself. I don't know what to do. I'm lost now. Not having those weekly sessions did not help but I had someone to talk to that at first I didn't have any thoughts of killing, I don't know what I'd be doing in therapy anyways. I don't have any goals. I don't want to be happy. I don't. If I'm happy it'll soon become sadness again, nothing lasts. I feel empty.

44,"I've been on an anti-depressant for about a year and a half after a traumatic work experience. After some balancing around, I found a type and a dosage that seemed to work for me.

The last several weeks, however, I've gradually been feeling low again, particularly at night. I've always taken my anti-depressant at night, and it hasn't been an issue until now. Apart from it being hard to fall asleep, I tend to end up in tears suddenly. This sudden alertness leads to falling asleep way too late, sleeping in far too long, feeling guilty about sleeping half the day away, and thus the same spiral continues.

In the last year I've gained about 20 lbs, despite working out three times a week, hiking nearly every weekend, and cutting fast food out of my diet. I understand weight gain happens with some anti-depressants, but I find it incredibly frustrating, especially now that I'm working harder than ever before in my life to lose weight. This, plus the idea of looking for a job in my new field after my horrible experience, are the main factors to my depression at the moment. While worrying about these two issues, I also tend to get worried that my boyfriend is going to leave me, which I fully acknowledge is absurd because we're mutually crazy about each other, but my brain seems to think this is something I need to consider.

I'm seeing my GP in two weeks, and my therapist in one, but in the meantime I wanted to get this off my chest. I'd appreciate any similar anecdotes you all have.

tl;dr -- 

1) Have any of you been on an anti-depressant that no longer seems to be helping as much, or at all?

2) Have any of you taken an anti-depressant that suddenly keeps you awake at night (or makes you drowsy) when it didn't before?

Thank you in advance. Truly.",03Aug2019,1
45,"The answer seems a clear 'yes' just as i typed the title but i'm specifically talking about trying to 'fix' what was broken at home and past behaviour manifesting themselves in current relationships?


I'll give a bit of context to better explain my question. 

I just went through a break-up with my ex-girlfriend a month ago, we were living together and i pretty much saw myself being with her for the rest of my life (buying a house, having kids, etc) but as time went on she started feeling neglected and that i'm not that attracted to her sexually, this led to bickering and fights untill one day she just packed her things and moved back in with her parents. 


Setting the details of the break-up and the relationship story aside, i've done a lot of thinking and reading books this past month trying to figure out what went on. I'm fully aware she is 100% correct in the fact that i've been avoiding her, staying up late to watch video games when she was in bed in the mood to have sex, watching porn instead of having fun with her, etc. It wasn't totally dysfunctional as we did have sex once two or three days on average but overall i have come to realize she was rightfully pissed off and felt something was wrong. 


I stumbled upon a passage in a book that talked about a situation just like this and apparently this happens when you had a bad relationship with your mother (as i did, she was emotionally abusive and used me as a shrink/emotional sponge to unload her drama on me after fighting/getting beat up by my dad. This happened when i was between the ages of 6-12.) and you seek that love and validation from your adult partner to make up for what you missed as a child. 


Sadly as a side-effect to this, just as being attracted to your mother is and feels wrong, you also have a hard time viewing your current partner as a woman, with everything that it entails. So it basically feels like a nailhead for my situation, the better i got along with my girlfriend, the less i could approach her sexually as an adult, i guess i viewed her as an image of my mother i finally got along with.



Looking back at my other relationships/flings, the more crazy/unfit for anything stable the partner felt, the more open sexually i was and felt free and everything was great. Inversely, when i met someone down to earth and with potential for a long-term commitment, i immediately felt put off by them sexually and had to fight an uphill battle sex-wise. I'm astounded i just now see this.


Basically this is pretty powerful stuff, could it be possible and true? I'm scared i have a lot of things to fix now. I've seen a therapist a few years ago and she wasn't really helpful. Aside from trying therapy now with a more capable therapist, does anyone know any books on the subject about things like these? I'm very eager to try and fix myself so as not to let this happen again.",03Aug2019,2
46,Just wondering if anyone ever found a difference between repression and depression? I think I might be transgendered and thinking maybe repression is more my problem then depression is. As far back as middle school I cross dressed but never heard of  transitioning or transgendered back then.

47,"FYI to preface: 31/F, diagnosed bipolar II and BPD, currently taking lithium, Seroquel, Effexor and on a fortnightly rTMS regime. 

I have been under a fair amount of stress lately and working very long hours which I know would be a contributing factor. The first thing to go for me when I’m stressed is my personal hygiene, and it wouldn’t be unusual for me to go 5 days without showering (I work remotely). 

More recently, I’ve been having increasing difficulty in maintaining contact with friends and family. I sometimes joke that I have an agoraphobia centric personality and try to keep an eye on these behaviours as I feel I could easily slip past the point of no return. Especially since the technical age has meant I can have everything I need delivered right to my door, so leaving the house has become increasingly rare. 

When someone messages or calls me, I feel a degree of what I think I would describe as anxiety, which sort of prevents me from or compels me not to answer. I’ve sent out messages trying to justify the reduced engagement, saying things like ‘I need to switch off’ and ‘I need a break from the world’. I’ve gotten to the stage of thinking that I would be perfectly happy here on my own and not having to interact with another human again. 

So I want to understand the psychology behind this newly found aversion to keeping in contact with the people in my life, and what is causing me to want to hide away in my house alone. 

Is it depression that would cause this? Are there are risk factors I should be aware of? Would love some suggestions of things I can read up on, I find it very therapeutic to analyse my behaviours and reactions and really understand the specific thought processes I go through. Only then, can I feel in control.

Ketamine has time and time again been proven to be one of the most powerful cures of treatment resistant depression.  
Many people are beginning to realise how much potential this drug has in terms of the long term curative impacts on depression and PTSD. Clinics are beginning to pop up all around the world, we can accelerate this process.

Many of us have experienced 'down's in our life. We understand how incredibly difficult it is to endure despite not showing any physical signs.  
There are so many people in the world that are trapped in this 'down' spiral and see the only way to escape is through death.

Once I get enough supporters, I am going to write a formal letter to the Black Dog Institute, pushing for Ketamine treatments to begin.  
If anyone knows any other Institution who has been trialling/considering Ketamine treatment for Depression and PTSD, please let me know and I will write a letter to them.

Lets make a change and fight for all of those around us who are suffering silently.

50,"Recently I noticed I have a self esteem problem. I'm really awkard at social situations. I'm only comfortable around my small group of friends and my boyfriend. Talking to other people is a huge problem for me. 
Also the problem is in my looks. I don't think I'm not pretty. In my opiniom I'm average looking person. But the problem is in my weight. I'm really skinny so my body is not curvy like other girls. It may sound pretty shallow but I wish I was looking more girly.
This problem affects my relationahip. I have a carring and loving boyfriend. He's really supportive in everything I do. He often tells me I'm beautiful, but I'm always afraid I'm not enough... He tells me that it is far from the truth, but I can't stop thinking of myself as not good enough. When we talk about this he blames it on him. He says he should tell me more nice things. Of course that is not the truth, this is not his fault.    I'm afraid he will become tired of helping me. He says he won't, that I shouldn't be worried about him but only about myself. But he doesn't know what will happen in the future.

He didn’t give himself enough time between breaking up with his ex to being with me to heal from his last relationship, so we both really need to work on ourselves so we can be better partners to each other. We’ve decided to drop all titles and just be friends until we are ready to come back to each other. 

It’s so scary and strange to me because he was my boyfriend for so long and now we’re just friends. I don’t know how to be his friend, I didn’t even know how to be a girlfriend because he’s my first real relationship (I’m 21 btw) in my whole life, so when it comes to getting to know somebody and being in a relationship I had no knowledge of how this was supposed to go. It makes me sad that I can’t kiss him or hold him or be all lovey dovey with him anymore; we’re setting boundaries when it comes to that type of stuff and it’s just a scary transition for me.

If anyone’s ever been in situation before, what did you do? How did you get through it?

I’ve always been paranoid but it’s been worse lately. When I sleep at home I obviously lock both doors, set my alarm, but then I also sleep with these alarmed door stoppers on my room’s door. It’s gotten to the point though where I’m nervous to be in my own room without the door stoppers locking me in. 

I’m at my grandpa’s tonight (just got out of the hospital, since I’m still sick the hospital recommended I stay with family) and I know it’s probably the safest place to be (many alarms, loud stairs so impossible to sneak, in a gated community).  I’m still up and scared, all the “what if’s” run through my mind and no matter how exhausted I am I can’t go back to sleep. 

I just feel ridiculous that I’m so scared of leaving my room that I can’t even get up to pee. I don’t know what’s causing it but my anxiety and paranoia have escalated in the last few months.",03Aug2019,1

54,"Ive just spent half the year on antidepression meds they did nothing. So i thought it must be anxiety thats making me feel bored of pretty much everything. 
There has only been a few things ive found intresting and there random but interesting information about random subjects. 
Yet i continuously feel like doing something normal like drawing. Some thing i actually want to do i get ready and everything and than quit and go lay down bored even though there is something i want to do. 
Do note its not like i say im not depressed like who isnt? 
What im saying is im bored unless its something fast that gets my mind racing. 
Its like my brains hocked on an adrenalin rush that it needs to actually operate.
Otherwise it makes my anxiety (thinking) go into overdrive. 

While im driving aslong as im not behind anyone going below the speed limit i feel fine but the moment they start going slow for no reason i get angry at them
It feels like my brain has to go slower just to operate in there world

I originally thought i had adhd going of the symptoms yet looking into people with adhd i dont feel like i fit in there. 

Ive always had a difficulty learning when i was in school as nothing after learning the basics intrigued me 

Im 24. 
My job does involve moving around alot but when im having to sit or work in a slow pace i feel like just quitting my job

The only thing ive found that helps me is music can be just about any type aslong as my brain feels like following the sounds.


So if anyone has any idea what it could be id appreciate the help",03Aug2019,1
55,"I’m under treatment with a community mental health team based in Australia NSW, it’s essentially free. I’m 23 if that is needed. 

I don’t really know what I have, the team I am with have off handedly mentioned schizophrenia and cluster A personality disorder (either schizoid or schizotypal) and they are certain I have major depression and “some type of psychotic illness”. But my psychiatrist has said there is “no consensus” on my exact diagnosis at the moment. It’s been 3 years and it’s still at this point.

I’m just wondering if it is any point continuing treatment, it’s become really tedious, to say the least, I have cut back the visits I have with the psychologist/case manager, but I’m leaning towards cutting it back even further. 

When I do attempt to cut back the appointments the case manager tries to guilt trip me, saying “why are you pushing us away?”, I haven’t replied to that question as it’s unfounded and in my opinion a really stupid question to ask, in the context of mental health (especially considering I have an assumed psychotic illness and cluster A PD). 

I’m definitely getting worse, symptom-wise, mostly psychotic negative symptoms, imo, but it is getting to the point that I can’t exactly function properly. Extreme anhedonia and apathy, among other things. If it is negative symptoms, I’ve read pretty much nothing can be done to help it, other than some types of therapy, but reliable therapy is almost certainly out of my pay range. 

I’m just asking here, just in case any of you guys have been in a similar position, in terms of weighing up continuing treatment or not.",03Aug2019,2

I dunno, I've never felt very normal. I was around drunks as a kid especially my dad. Growing up there was weird sexual shit based around my dads house, even now.

Ive read some stuff online about how to beat anxiety and fear and alot of it is to just face it because i have done that before also with my eating disorder and thats how i overcame it. Ive read about writting down your thoughts a few times but ive never really done it. Today i decided to do that, i wrote down exactly the thoughts and what triggered the fear. I also wrote down how none of it is real and the fear is made up and other things to read when the thoughts come back. As i kept reading through them, it became easier for me and it kinda calmed down my nerves. I slowly started to think how the fears arent worth it and that i have pretty much nothing to worry about because it is all in my head. Im glad i did this today.",03Aug2019,4
59,"For some fucking reason, regardless of where I am and if my past is involved or not, I’m treated like I shouldn’t be dealt with. Even if I transfer to a new school, nobody is interested. I’m the big fuck up, mommy’s boy, 1st gen of foreigners,  nerd, fatass, computer guy. I can’t feel happy at all around people because of how evil they are. They all treat me like I’m left to be ignored. I can’t say my word, I can’t open my mouth, because I’m never heard. I don’t feel suicidal, I rather feel like I need to punish and destroy my fucking body because nobody needs me around to be happy, Even with a Girlfriend, I still feel this way. I just wish I wasn’t in love with technology either, because even striving to do things such as reach out to others in social media ruins me. I just want to fucking rip myself apart seeing higher followers of my best friends and girlfriend at around 100 or 150, yet I’m around at 20 with bots of promotional bullshit because who really gives a shit about me. The worse part is, you know that feature where you can Double Tap to like a post on Instagram? From the people that follow me, they scroll and double tap every post they see, but if they see a post from me, they freak out and unlike. Imagine how shitty it feels to post a picture of yourself to get 2 or 5 likes, yet when you post a picture of your lover you get 20.

I’m sorry I’m such a wreck, I hope somebody knows my pain out there. I wish I can be an entirely different person so that nobody looks down on me like scum. I wish I can fit in. At least let me experience what my girlfriend or friends can. I wish I’m not who I am. Nobody whats to see this “I,” so if I just be someone completely new, maybe I won’t be the fucking disaster I am now. Who am I kidding, nobody’s going to see this, nobody’s going to care.

Lately I've been having this issue where I can't tell my dreams apart from reality.. it could be something major or something incredibly small such as this
I gave my two week notice in at work last week and sent an email to my boss asking what she would like for me to do with the keys. I don't remember dreaming about work but I clearly remember getting an email back from her that was uncharacteristically rude and short but when I checked in the emails there was nothing from her.
The same thing happened with thinking me we had someone over to cut the grass in our front yard though we never talked about it and I don't remember dreaming of it, I just went outside to walk the dog and saw the grass and was confused and disoriented for a little while..

In the process of trying to fix the situation I asked for advice and told how the person hates me and what I believed was the situation, I showed the person I wronged what was posted and they claimed it was me being the victim and I dont understand how. But it's not the first time I've heard it so it must be true. 

The second part is I have a habit of comparing and always find myself asking how is this okay but not that or why is it okay when you do x but a problem when I do it, or how is this different than y?

Interactions are minimal with others, like if my daughter starts drolling on about something, I can process what she said minimally enough to know what it was she said but responses are ""mmmhmmm"" or ""yep"".  It happens in stressful situations most of the time, and I really feel like I have no control over pulling myself out of it. I almost feel like it is a coping mechanism my body has produced in order to deal with stress, as before in those stressful situations I would burst out in anger. Anyone else experience this?

Totally just venting as my consciouses being and neurotransmitters have a civil war...I would have never gone on meds if I were informed I’d be put through a year of suffering and social isolation. They never *really* helped that much, took the edge off and I thought ‘okay this is how normal people process, guess I need to be on these things’...turns out it’s more or less a big pharma endorsed lie, these meds rarely ever work out in the long term...and I’ve only been on them for 4 years.

It’s common knowledge that psychiatric medications are prone to sexual side effects. Since most people living with mental illness want to be both happy *and* have a satisfying sex life, this creates a bit of a quandary. Are the two things mutually exclusive? What does a person on psychiatric medications do when the cure seems worse than the illness? Listen in to find out now!

74,"Last week I went to my first session with a psychologist for talk therapy. Before I could see a therapist, the office rules required that I have an ""intake"" where I told this person that I travel every other month and that six months ago I had a trauma where my hair was fried off by a beautician after growing it 24 inches long, and I had to cut it to 2 inches because of damage. This intake person also wanted me to fill out a childhood development form of when I first started talking and walking, and if I was abnormal in my growth and wanted me to organize different colored objects to see if I was capable of this. First, I am a middle aged women with a college degree, and this seemed demeaning.

Next, I get to the office for my first talk therapy session (with a different women) and on my notes, it says that I ""travel the world, but am unsure of how she is able to afford world travel"" and that ""unsure of how (my) hair was friend off, and if this was accurate"". Then to finish the session, the therapist says that during the session I had ""loose associations"" (def.    
a manifestation of a thought disorder whereby the patient's responses do not relate to the interviewer's questions, orone paragraph, sentence, or phrase is not logically connected to those that occur before or after) and that I am exceptional ""harsh"" about myself.

75," 

My backyard is an absolute nightmare right now. 

When I open the sliding glass door to let the dogs outside I feel ashamed. My yard is full of weeds. The tarp I used to use to cover my compost pile is strewn between the lilac tree and our grandma tree - the thornless honey locust. My wheelbarrow is on its side on top of the tarp. It’s amazing what kind of laziness it takes to put something on top of something else so it doesn’t blow away. There are weeds throughout, some taller than me, though I’m only 5’7”. 

This yard has gone through a lot. When we moved in 10 years ago it was a nice green lawn. The previous owner took pride in his yard. I admire people who take pride in the presentation of their homes, I wish I was like that, I strive to be like that. I had the goal of getting rid of some of the grass to make space for a vegetable garden. For a few years we had a good thing going. We grew tomatoes, peppers, onions, we even had a carrot once (damn dog ate it). Living in a desert, the concept of a lawn doesn’t makes sense to me. I wanted to xeriscape my yard. It’s essentially planting area-specific vegetation that is drought tolerant while incorporating designs with rocks and mulch. That’s a terrible description but good enough for the purposes of this rant.

The inside of the house is better. Most rooms are cleaned regularly, but there are “projects” like cleaning the mess of a garage, shampooing carpets, painting the walls, and a whole host of other ideas that I’d like to do to the house. My room is one of the worst, as I keep my bed only clean on the side I sleep on. Having a king sized bed with only me and a 15 lb terrier bitch allows me to be lazy with the other side. I’ve got a seemingly endless sock situation and a basket at the end of my bed that sometimes holds dirty clothes but could just as easily be full of clean clothes I should folding. I keep the floor vacuumed and the bathroom decently clean. The main living areas are in good shape except for the project stuff that they could use.

I know I should clean more. There are other things I need to do more of as well like cooking a decent meal for my kids and me. I should call and visit my last remaining grandparent and my aging aunts and uncles. I have an unfinished bachelor’s degree that I should probably finish. My dogs should be brushed more frequently as well. My job is killing me and I should really be looking for something new and getting my resume out there. There seem to be so many things I could and should be doing you’d think I wouldn’t have time to think about how shitty I feel, but therein lies the reason I’m writing this instead of doing...anything else. 

On a daily basis I live with depression, anxiety, and ADHD. I am newly single after a 10 year marriage. I’ll save you the sob story but suffice it to say I have had an extremely difficult year emotionally. I often find myself thinking about death, about how my passing would alleviate my pain. Yes I understand it would take my pain and transfer it to my loved ones, but I still think about it. I think about how I would do it, to whom I would write and what the letters would contain, and I think about the aftermath too and that keeps me from doing anything. But I do think about it far more frequently than I’d like to admit. Though it’s far too frequent, it’s still much less common than it was even just a few months ago. 

I have a hard time turning my brain off. I overthink everything. When I’m planning a project the anxiety makes me second guess every decision I make. When meeting new people I’m constantly wondering if they are only talking to me because they want to be nice. I’m even like this with my friends which I know is hogwash but it still happens. When I know of a stressful situation ahead of time I will think about any potential scenario over and over again.

I also find it difficult to follow a train of thought from beginning to end. I will go into the kitchen to get my dog some water then notice someone spilled something on the counter. I grab the rag to wipe that up and see that someone had left some clean dishes on another counter. I go put those away and come back to the rag but I see someone left the milk out, so I put that in the fridge. I go back to the rag and wipe the counter and go on about my day, several hours later realizing I never gave the dog water. This exact situation happened recently, and it’s just one example of my brainly chaos.

After meandering through these different thought threads I bring it back to the motivation for writing this, my backyard is a mess because I’m exhausted all the time. The energy it takes to keep from crying/thinking of death, to stop myself from ruminating over some conversation I had with a woman at the bar I’ll likely never see,  or to try and complete a task from start to finish is absurd. I have kids I have to take care of and a house to tend to alone, I have a job that has been a major stress point, and I have this mental state that keeps me in a constant state of flux. I’ve come a long way, and I have a long way to go. Please forgive me if I don’t seem friendly, or if I seem lazy because of my yard, I don’t like it and I know I should do better, but please understand that if you peek under the skin you’ll see there’s more going on than what you see.",03Aug2019,0

77,"I have recently started to realize that the opinions I have, or how i would like things to be/how i think others would like things to be... is not how most people feel at all, and in fact may be a very minority position/view.

It's really made me start questioning just how different or ""not-normal"" (or sane, socially functional, etc) I really am.

And I don't mean different in, like, ""this car is nicely styled"", or extremist political views... more like I just barely feel functional in social situations, like I'm just an observer who can see why I'm doing the things I'm doing but other people dont think this same way.

""Oh, you keep wiping your nose because your nervous"".  ""You're playing your music loud because you want people to hear it"".  ""You're only dressing nicely to try and impress strangers"".  Its like being fully cognizant of how vane, petty, and pointless so many aspects of social interaction are, and I just cant bring myself to participate because I think it's stupid and unnatural.  And that has alienated me into a mindset that isnt shared by many others and continues to compound how ostracized i feel.  

The only place I am fully comfortable, and free to be who I am... is when I am alone.  And that, I think I'm right on this one, is NOT how most people operate.

And I just feel like I need him, but I also feel that it would be selfish to tell him that. Maybe I need to deal with this on my own. But I've just never been this scared",03Aug2019,2
82,"I (28F) have been aware of my death wish since around the time it showed itself explicitly, which was soon after I underwent an abortion alone when I was 20. I cut myself every night for months, but never fatally: I consciously, intentionally lived for my family. Eight years later, I feel defeated by many more things. The most recent blow is my very intimate relationship ending days before the wedding. Unlike my last deep pit (the incident eight years ago), this time, I am aware my family does not exactly ""need"" me anymore (not doubting their wanting me), which means this time, I don't have anything to hope/live for, which means even though I am aware of my issues, I have absolutely zero interest in resolving them.

Is there any way to get myself out of this?

Adding: I can actually think of a few things to live for, but none of them is in my hands for various reasons, so I have pretty much counted them out.",03Aug2019,4

84," 

So me and this girl has been talking for a few months. We both liked eachother but we havent really hung out much since the start of the summer. We hung out once about two weeks ago and she seemed to be intrested then, she really wanted to meet up afterwards aswell. We was supposed to hang out one day but she cancelled because she had a depressive period, which was all ok with me.

But then she became distant and didnt respond to my messages. She had previously told me that she had been suicidal. So I was naturally worried. But she responded and said she was alright.

Then a few days ago she told me she didnt have feelings for me anymore and didnt want to meet me anymore. I was shocked and tried to convince her otherwise. I then gave up on that and tried to be supportive of her instead of trying to convince her to meet me while she was down.

Im trying to convince myself that this is all a consequence of her depression and that she still wants to meet me. But when I talk to her i start to doubt that.

Am I doing the right thing? Should I just give her up or is she still interested in me?

EDIT: Might be worth noting that she recently changed her anti-depressants, she told me thats why shes feeling down.",03Aug2019,1

My mom is the only one not earning minimum wage and is holding the family together. She lately got diagnosed with an infection (I still don't know what) about 3 days ago I heard her talking on the phone talking about how she might get brain tumors. I asked her about it and she told me a bit about it. About how she might get sick and lose her memory I don't know if she might die or not. But she won't answer any more questions. I've always been depressed and suicidal from my dad's death but I've always held it together until now. I'm not ready for my mom to leave me. I'm still young enough not to get a job. I don't want to be put into foster care. I've heard multiple stories about how it is. The government provides therapists which help you in dark times. But I wouldn't be able to stand that even just 1 person outside my family knows about this. I don't have any friends or someone I can talk to. I don't know what to do simply.

She’s brought multiple older muslim people to do basically a islamic exorcism to remove the evil jinn or shaytan. I love my religion and believe in it fully but I honestly don’t believe that the reason why I have psychosis and PTSD is because of shaytan or jinn.

95,"My therapist lent me her Anxiety &amp; Phobias Workbook. In it, it discusses minor and major symptoms of feeling anxious to full blown panic attacks. It also has TONS of coping strategies.

Its hard though. My anxiety had gone ignored since I was a toddler (I would pick my skin without noticing everywhere I went and it was put off as just a gross habit). I also have had Social Anxiety from about age 10. It was put off as me being shy. To this day I am deathly afraid of my future unless someone makes the decisions for me.

I am posting this to maybe be validated on being overwhelmed after learning to notice a variety of symptoms.

I don't know how to relax and when I try deep breathing and other calming techniques, they don't always work and when they don't work, I get slightly more anxious. I'm not lying when I say that I have several symptoms that NEVER go away.

Such as:

muscle tension, shaky and sweaty hands, shallow breaths, body feeling hot and sweating, and the painful tension headache that might go away for several hours only to return again. I was born with a mitral valve prolapse and arrhythmia and developed asthma at very young.

So If I am anxious all of the time with so many persistent symptoms, how do I relax enough to focus on getting better. I'm even on medications. Could I just be magnesium-deficient? Is this even anxiety or something worse?

Please respond if you have a similar experience. The fat book my therapist gave me says nothing about persistent/chronic/uncontrollable symptoms.",03Aug2019,137
96,"This is for anyone that isn’t already familiar with what the abbreviation stands for, but it stands for Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder.

I’m 17 and I’ve been struggling with OCPD since I was eleven. Now I’ve never been diagnosed with it or anything for that matter because my parents are strictly against me seeking any kind of external help but desperate times call for desperate measures.

I didn’t understand my obsession with needing things to be a certain way. It’s crazy the amount of times I’ve changed my handwriting just because it didn’t seem aesthetically pleasing to me, but everyone else thought it was neat enough. It started with small and irrelevant things like that, but now it’s gotten worse in the last two years or so.

I’ve wasted a lot of stuff just over the last few months because they’ve either gotten a scratch or a dent and I couldn’t stand it not being in perfect condition anymore so I’d throw it out.

I’ve even wasted time during a test because I made a mistake so I decided to rewrite the essay during the remaining time.

But I only do these things to help deal with the anxiety I feel when these “mistakes” do occur.

Anyways it’s gotten pretty ridiculous and frankly enough, reading about OCPD and its symptoms, it perfectly describes the way I behave.

I want to seek professional advice but that just isn’t an option right now, so I thought I’d post something about it here.

If there’s anyone who understands what I’m talking about or is going through the same thing, please just talk to me.

97," I am taking medication to treat depression, which is a tricyclic antidepressant. I switched over to this around 1.5y ago. Some weird shit is happening, and I believe this drug is the cause.   
 

\- I see things when I wake up, around 6 nights a week. They are mostly subtile and not scary, like city skylines projected on my curtains, my name scribbled on my walls, bugs on my retina, little stains turning into moving sceneries. Sometimes they are more disturbing as I turn my head and suddenly see something very close to my face and scream. They usually fade within minutes. I am definitely awake and moving my head in these instances btw, sometimes even moved to the other side of the room to turn the light switch. That’s why I feel like it’s different than sleep paralysis because it lingers longer.   
 \- I see geometrical shapes when I close my eyes and on solid walls, like mandelas of diamond and hexagons, they appear when the after images fade out. Pretty much all the time, but especially clearly in the afternoon. Recently though black shapes are projected in front of the mandelas, human eyes, and human figures that are moving/walking in or out of the frame or turning their heads around. Which is kind of scary.   
 

I don’t really know what to do. These things sound very tame, but I have a feeling that they are slowly escalating. Anyone else have these weird ocular things happening due to taking antidepressants? Or does everyone see patterns in the dark and I just took notice of them now?",03Aug2019,1
98,"So while having multiple mental disorders and going to therapy, I realize that, from a very young age, I had been showing possible symptoms of something that might have gone under the radar of being part of my disturbed mind.

I went through this thing that I would hear the rhythm of something someone had said and it would replay in my mind and I would tap it out with my right hand fingers over and over again, and if the rhythm didn't fit with the symmetry of my 5 fingers in a pleasing pattern it would leave me mildly irritated. I still do this today but in elementary school is was CONSTANT. (im doing it now actually! ill list the pattern as 1-5 starting with the right hand thumb as 1... {212134354321})

Another thing is when I was in Pre-k and Kindergarten and maybe even before that, I would be laying in bed trying to fall asleep but the speed of the fan was slow but kind of fast at the same time and the tempo of it made me hold my breath and my heart beat hard. My mind couldn't help but follow the pattern (eyes closed) and it would eventually leave me dizzy and very uncomfortable.

Another less troubling one was when floor tiles had checkered patterns or sometimes no pattern at all, just individual squares of the same color. I would make sure every step fit in the square and if I stepped out, my chest would tighten for  a moment. As for the checkered floor or any tiled floor with a pattern is avoiding the other colored tiles and if my legs could not reach the next right tile I would feel stuck and only moved when my parents got too far away.

Sometimes, he needs to take breaks from me, because he says that I’m a great person and he likes me more than he likes himself and he can’t stand it. His bouts of envy last for hours at a time.

100,"**Warning:** Discusses self harm, suicidal behavior

Recently I spent the night over at my close friend's house to chill out. At one point, I reached under her nightstand to grab something, and found a hidden note from her ex-friend. In it, the ex-friend described how this close friend was a pathological liar that liked to pretend she was abused \[and suicidal, that part is true\], but that she was ""getting better"". It hit me that the same afternoon, she denied ever pathologically lying. Later that night, we were searching for her lost phone, when I lifted up a pillow on her bed. Under it I found at least 30 tissues, all of them blotted with dried blood. I just shuddered, said, ""Oh god"", and resumed looking for her phone. This could have been passed off as bloody nose tissues or something, except that earlier I found a box with some tissues exactly like those, and she told me the tissues were used to clean up the cuts on her from self harm. Keeping that in mind, this close friend claimed she hadn't cut in months. I couldn't see any new injuries, even as she walked around wearing basically nothing. In other places, she had multiple writings about self harm, suicide, ex-friends, and obsessive fanfics about a badly influential friend (Weirdly enough, she read some of these things aloud to me). She later held broken glass to her neck jokingly, and cut her hand with it, maybe unintentionally. She takes depression medication and claims that she's happy now, but I'm not sure what to believe. Even when I was self-harming, I got rid of the evidence. Can anyone help me figure out what's going on?

106,"I'm a 17M if that matters. Late last night I texted the girl I've been very close with and asked if she truly loved me, and if I should even waste time going after her. This morning she responded, and it broke me. She said she didn't want to go any further with me, that her fear of commitment and fear of physical affection wouldn't let her. She said it was a result of her bad childhood. 

Everything I have done since falling in love with this woman I've done for her. When times would get rough, when I'd be in the darkest spots, the very thought of her would help me out of it. It was our friendship that helped me out of my pit of drug abuse and brutal self harm. I feel the scars on my arms and legs and know the reason there aren't more is because of her. This woman is everything to me, and the worst part is she's under no obligation to feel the same. 

I feel so lost right now. Where do I even go from here? I am so mentally ill, I'm bipolar, have borderline/dependant personality traits, and I too had a truly horrible childhood that haunts me daily. The difference between us though is that her childhood made her afraid to be loved, afraid of affection and physical touch, believing she is worthless and undeserving of love. 

My childhood, however, left me with crippling abandonment issues, a tendency to fall way too in love (infatuation?), and just horribly intense emotions. I know I should let her go, but I can't. I don't want to be abandoned like I always fucking am. I want to be there to see her improve and get better and heal from her old wounds so we can be together. 

And yet, I want to cut myself, deeply, end all contact with her, and die. I want her to look at what's happened to me and know that this was her fault. Like the horrible manipulative fucked up person I am. 

I feel that in giving up everything for her I have begun to live *for* her. My life has no meaning without her, and without meaning I have no reason to live. I always hoped things between us would work out, that she'd magically overcome her fears and we'd be together, happy. I wanted to make memories with her that I could look back upon and remember as the good ol' days. I was an idiot for hoping. 

I really don't know what to do. I am genuinely just so sick of being alive because the world has just fucked me over and over and I'm not even an adult yet. There's no point in thinking of ""all I have to live for"" because I am so seriously sick and this kind of sickness won't improve with time.

I've just been putting talcum powder in it to help it look less neglected. I've also been using a two-in-one shampoo/conditioner when I do wash my hair, though my hair gets greasy quickly after using it compared to using seperate shampoo and conditioners. I've also been not washing my face as much as I should, just using face wipes but the clean feeling doesn't last long after using them. 

Though tonight I had the sudden urge to put a face mask on, put coconut oil in my hair (Had them on/in for about 40mins, maybe a little more) and have a nice shower. I washed myself head to toe using my nice body wash, washed my hair using some expensive shampoo and conditioner I treated myself to just before my wedding (At £9 a bottle I'm making it last!). And I feel sooooo good! I also washed my face properly(ish) though had to use the hubbies face and beard wash as my face wash was empty haha! Though it has left my face feeling really nice.

112,"This happened yesterday. Everything was fine and then BAM! I started getting panicky. For me panic attacks always feel like I'm choking and/or like I might throw up. I have a phobia of throwing up, so feeling like I might get sick intensifies the panic, and it goes on and on in a vicious cycle. I also felt clammy and lightheaded and slightly dizzy.

My mind went blank and I had a really hard time concentrating on what we were talking about. I was super fidgety and kept touching my hair. I'm pretty sure my therapist knew something was up.

I don't know why I didn't tell her that I was having a panic attack? I think part of me couldn't believe that it was happening, it was so ironic. We weren't talking about anything particularly upsetting or triggering. It came out of nowhere, like it always does.

I felt better after the session, and was even able to manage a trip to the grocery store.

Next week I might tell her what happened, but I feel embarrassed about it. I know that's kinda silly, she's my therapist after all, but I'm worried she'll think it was something she did or said that caused it because it definitely wasn't- just my nervous system being idiotic and overreactive.

I'm young but I'm old enough to where people are pressuring me into different career paths/universities. I don't even know what I want, who I am. I want to go with what I love but what is that anymore? But I know if I'm forced to do something I didn't choose then I'll be angry at myself and even more depressed. 

I don't know what to do.",03Aug2019,2
115,"Is there such a guide? 

I need some simple way of trying to work through my emotions/feelings - figure out why I'm thinking that way and trying to challenge those ideas somehow. But it needs to be simple as I've ADHD so can't read through a load of books.

FYI I've had therapy multiple times but haven't had anything like this (despite asking for this and/or for CBT), therapy has been zero help at all.

I'm just kind of sick of the same thoughts going around and around and around and around. I'm pretty well aware of a lot of my mental health issues, triggers, why I feel how I do generally, but I've no idea how to work through these things. 

Hopefully this makes sense to someone.",03Aug2019,0
116,"Warning: like everithing I do, this will waste your time, I just want to vent. I feel like absolute shit since over one and a half years. I have everything I need: a very good apprenticeship, a nice and loving girlfriend, nice parents (which don't know about my problems), nice friends, but I'm still not happy at all. I feel such an emptyness. I'm pretty shy when not drugged. I just hate myself all the time. I don't have any bodily problems. I still feel like I'm absolutely unworthy and useless. I probably am. Since the last few weeks my inner voice started saying that I should just end myself. Fuck this world, we all are worthless in this gigantic emptiness aka. the universe. I should be happy but I ain't. I feel absolutely sorry for my gf which had mental problems before me. I am such a weight for everyone. The world would be better without me. Fuck this shit. Fuck all of it. Everything is useless. Just as I am.",03Aug2019,1
