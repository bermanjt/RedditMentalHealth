0,Someone I know that has schizophrenia stopped taking their medicine because they felt they didn't have schizophrenia and that it went away and for the past couple of months they haven't been in the best condition I want to help them but I can't convince them to get help no matter what I say what should I do for them?,27May2019,1
1,"Okay so basically, every single day I’m so paranoid about timings. I worry constantly about what the time is, and if I make plans with other people I get extremely frustrated if they are late or don’t agree on an exact time to meet up. It’s getting to the point where I can’t relax bc I’m constantly worried about what time it is and what I should be doing, but I’m so anxious that I don’t get anything done bc all I focus on is the time. I never used to be like this, it seems to have started throughout the last few months and I don’t know why. I have no idea if this is anxiety or OCD related? It would be helpful to know if anyone has any advice or has experienced a similar thing.",27May2019,1

Even worse I have reached out for help soo many times and people don't want to know they just want to run the other way.

4,"Being Ugly and Feeling Ugly. When I look at myself in the mirror, I don’t like what I see. I am ugly. I have an ugly face that’s only getting worse because of bad sleep, an ugly body and ugly style. I am ugly to myself and I am ugly to others, there’s no other way around it. It devalues the rest of me in the eyes of others. I don’t like living while being ugly. It only holds me back from things. Because I’m this way, I’m super limited for romance on top of being short/small framed. It makes me not desirable romantically ever ( knowing and thinking about that makes me feel bad) and it makes me inferior in the eyes of others. I’ll never have the luxury of relationships, dates, anything. I’ve never been loved and never will be loved (even on a family sense - my entire upbringing being another issue altogether that won’t be the main focus of this piece). I dont have the luxury of being confident because by default I've been cursed with something that is forever lasting. Forever. From now until I die. This is the only life I have and I’m stuck with this.  This is a part of my identity I’m stuck with! I get depressed every time I thoroughly think about how I’m stuck like this. I always want to cry. I can’t feel cool no matter what I become because of this piece of me. There are so many disadvantages that come with being short, ugly and brown, I couldn’t list them all. To sum all of those things up, more people want less to do with you than they would an average looking or attractive person and see you as beneath those other people. Anything that involves being face to face with another person affects ugly people. “Be confident” doesn't mean a thing to me. It's an imaginary idea. I have too many problems and insecurities and circumstances that make my life miserable. I don’t like being associated with this ugly. I don’t like being reminded by myself that I look this way. It’s like going outside with your shirt inside out... but with a shirt you can fix it, but being ugly is something that is forever. The only way I can go outside is by forgetting that I’m ugly somehow or by forcing myself by adopting a nihilistic mindset before leaving the house. I’m tired of being beneath others and not good enough. And I can’t do anything about this pain. On top of enduring this pain, I have to suppress it so that I don’t hurt myself or become a danger to society. Being ugly isn’t just something that holds you back. It’s something that eats away at you. I can’t do a thing about it. There are times when I don’t even want to go outside because of the way I look. It’s painful. Sometimes, I have to remind myself that I have to live my life and can’t let being ugly take over. There’s no solution to this. I just have to deal with it and the sadness that comes with it. Many people don’t have to deal with this at all, so they don’t have the solution for it or need a solution. No matter how much I explain how this feels, no one who isn’t like me will ever understand what it’s like. I’m tired of my therapists sugar coating things for example telling me I’m not ugly. They only say that because there’s nothing else they can do or say to people when they’re ugly. And I envy the attractive population so much for it. Wanting to experience what it would be like to be with an attractive person and feeling love leads to viewing of pornography and the viewing of pornography leads to more envy and frustration (on top of all of the other bad things about pornography which is another problem I’m dealing with - health problems). Being reminded of my looks by seeing myself, by seeing someone with better looks or with generally normal or good looks and by seeing people who are intimate irates me so much the same way the other things I'll say do. I wish I could take out all the feelings of anger and envy and inferiority on something. Before, I even wanted to take those feelings out on others but I suppressed those feelings by remembering that doing something unfairly doesn't solve the unfairness I've been dealt.

I envy all the attractive and tall white beautiful people out there. To them, I'm just a pile of shit. I have brown skin which is fitting. I cant be them, I cant be good enough for them and they look down on me. And theres nothing I can do about it.  I'm never going to let this go. Life isnt fair. And I'm always going to be frustrated about it. And the most I can do is just rant about it. How pathetic.",27May2019,2
5,"*The full conversation is at the bottom, under the TL;DR*

So, I contacted the Suicide Prevention Lifeline through their online chat system. I couldn't speak over the phone because my mom was in the house and she'll respond negatively if I reveal how deeply rooted my issues are.

I had to wait for hours and did it twice due to initial technical difficulties, which was frustrating but ultimately I got through it. However, the conversation felt as hollow as a greeting from a store clerk. (I admittedly wasn't the nicest at the end of the conversation either, though.) I know these people aren't therapists and most are volunteers, but this has left me pretty distraught over getting help for my continuous mental issues. I don't think I'll ever have the money to get a licensed therapist, especially with my mind in shambles, so this might be the best I can get. 

My friend strongly recommended that I go to people that can really understand what I'm going through, so maybe I just got unlucky, but I've heard similar failures amidst all the positivity around suicide hotlines. If I had wanted to kill myself, this lack of care would have made me finally do it.

I'm never going to do anything with my life, and now I don't know how I'm going to get out of that mindset and this spiral of underachievement and constant coping. My parents and surroundings are horrible, and now it's summer. I really don't have hope. I plan to throw myself at projects and volunteering over the summer, but I always succumb to lethargy either after an initial burst of accomplishment or before I even start.

I don't know what to do anymore other than ask for help that I can't seem to receive from anyone now.

**TL;DR:** A bad conversation on the suicide hotline has left me questioning any prospects for bettering my mental health. If I wanted to kill myself, this would have made me do it. I don't know what others get out of this hotline, but I'm not feeling it. I really don't know how I'm going to get help now.

Welcome to [Local Hotline], [Operator] will be right with you.

[Operator]
Thank you for contacting lifeline chat, my name is [Operator], how are you feeling, today?

[Me]
I'm feeling kinda upset, like my life is always worsening--partly due to my actions/inactions and partly due to past and current adversities. Yeah, I know that's a lot to take in.

[Operator]
I hear that you're feeling upset. Would you mind sharing your name?

[Me]
I'm [Name McNamerson]

[Operator]
Hi [Name], tell me more about those adversities and inactions that cause you to feel upset.

[Me]
Well, most recently I got two Ds, a C on in fourth quarter, and while I might be able to raise them up, it's doubtful because it's practically the end of the school year--only two more days that are just to make up tests...

[Operator]
It sounds like you're in school

[Me]
Yep. As for adversity, I have had a long streak of mental illness, never diagnosed due to backlash from parents, since fifth grade, and it has sagged down my academic achievement ever since.

[Me]
I fully believe I could be valedictorian and go off to MIT or something if it weren't for my mind holding me back. Of course, I have full responsibility for my mind, but I feel like I'm coping day in and day out without rest, just to live a pitiful life without socialization, excelling like I know I can, routine happiness, etc.

[Operator]
It seems like your activities at school hold you from socializing. There is nothing wrong by coping everyday to keep things going on.

[Me]
I haven't been doing much at school other than talking and sitting at desks. I do work, but at home I'm coping and can't focus on homework. Also, sorry for miscommunicating, when I complained about socialization, I meant outside of school. People seem to think I'm quite amicable and funny at school.

[Operator]
it sounds like you're having fun at school. Share with me about an activity that you will do tonight, to feel relax.

[Me]
Honestly, nighttime is when I feel the worst. I tend to just watch YouTube until I fall asleep, but I will jump up and down randomly and those exhausting ""fits"" are not relaxing to say the least. I don't know how to cope currently other than YouTube or texting my friend, but he'll be asleep.

[Operator]
Ok, hope you enjoy. You may always contact back , anytime later, we are 24/7. I wish you a wonderful night!

[Me]
Sure. You too. You really sound like a robot, but oh well maybe that's just the way these things go. Bye, I wish the best for the real you, and the worst to this conversation.

[Operator]
Ok, bye, good night!

[Me]
Goodnight!",27May2019,3

9,"As I sit here reading all this medical mumbo-jumbo from Google, I find my self wondering what the future will bring. More crying than laughter? The dead silence between us because neither understand what is happening?
Today was not necessarily a bad day but more of a sadly enlightening one. My husband of 10 yrs had been different the past few months. It began with him telling me of experiences that never occurred, became worry/anger and eventually, spiraled into paranoia and panic attacks. Its has been 8 months since this all began and we got a diagnosis today, psychosis.
These past 8 months have taken both of us for a ride and I'm wondering when it will stop. Now that I can finally put a word to this and do research to try to understand, I'm not sure I can do this. Don't get me wrong, I love my husband to death but the past few months have really taken a toll on my mental and emotional state. I just want to know that it does get better, for both of us.

I'm incredibly superficial. Of course when I'm feeling suicidal I will be more needy and really need a listening ear. I'm not about the simple life, simple pleasures. I feel like that will hinder my walk with Christianity and stuff. Also, of course, general mental health. Its incredibly isolating. I don't have the bpd part which is to crave close intimate relationships and enmeshment, maybe only when I am unwell. I love superficial relationships though I am kind of socially awkward.

12,"Hello everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

 Thanks in advance for taking the time to read this. I don't know what the end result will be but I need some help or some answers or anything and since I cant find anything maybe the community can help me. I guess I'll start with some tid-bits  about myself to get us going. 26 years old, Caucasian background (not that it matters; but mostly Irish and a mutt of everywhere else in Europe). Did really well in school all the way up to 7th or 8th grade but I cant remember, what I do know is that's when I started showing signs of ADHD and mood swings in certain environments and situations. Got kicked out sophomore year for fighting (all over a female) and received my GED. From there I got in more trouble, mostly stealing and fighting. Parents were great but as I got older my step dad started to snuff me out in favor of my brother. As an emotional and physically abusive alcoholic I don't care much for him and I've already made peace with any ""daddy issues"" what little there were. My Mom is one of my favorite people and has been through leagues more of life's bullshit than I'll ever experience in my lifetime. But she's always been there for me even though these days were pretty distant. In reality all I have to do is call but that is my laziness (scold me if you will). 

&amp;#x200B;

I kind of always knew something was off with me. But doctors and my folks easily explained it away and because I was kept naive and in the dark. But now things are different. MORE different. Constant thoughts of suicide and even though I've given up on actually trying I'm always begging any higher powers to just end it. I've tried connecting with God by any means but its hard to know anything since **NO ONE ANSWERS BACK!.** I'm constantly back and forth on this because I want to believe in God, it's how I was raised, but then I jump the wagon and curse Him and tell myself its not worth it to waste my time and sanity. It's a bit selfish I know, to constantly shout and curse the skies when stuff goes wrong or I have a bad day. But then a good day comes along and it turns me around. Maybe He is there and maybe I just need to have faith and things will turn around in the end. I don't want ""rewards"" or to barter doing good decent normal human being things for access to whatever Heaven might be. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know anymore. I've already forgotten why I was doing this. Why I thought anything was wrong in the first place. It could all just be bad luck. I just want it all to end. Whether or not by killing myself in some way, meds or therapy, I need...something. I'm so fucking god damn angry all the time! ***I HATE EVERYONE*** and there is no possible way on this earth to describe the level of hatred I have for mankind. I love my family and friends but if everyone, every single stupid waste of space person on this fucking rock, were to just disappear I would most likely go fully insane and probably kill myself. But I suck it up and do my best to remain calm at all times because I need to be smarter than myself. Otherwise I would be back in trouble and most likely get hardcore humbled by somebody and then lose everything. I don't understand why I think life is so bad because from the outside looking in it really isn't. I have a gf of almost 8 years, a house, a car, 3 dogs ( Oso, Leo and Bebe), a great and for the most part a really easy job. So what's the issue? Why the constant suicidal and homicidal thoughts followed bouts of aggression and abuse towards myself? 

&amp;#x200B;

What am I doing? Just wasting your time and I apologize for that. I'm just acting crazy don't feel sorry for him. I'll be a whole new self soon anyway. It's coming fast and its going to happen whether you like it or not. You want to die because you're scared of me. A new me is waiting and I couldn't be happier. help me. The next day will come and then the next and then the next and you will **ALWAYS** be miserable and unhappy and you will sit and watch on the back burner as he changes. Into what?  What will I become...?

So let's start off in the summer of 2018. I meet a girl and we start talking. We talk about a lot of things, and she brings up she has autism. So yeah I don't think much of it and she tells me about her abusive mom.  She confides in me and says that her mom beats her and starves her, among other things. Eventually we call CPS and tell the people at the summer camp. The people at the summer camp handled it (and did not tell the girls mom. This is important later.) Also, we started dating around that time because we had a lot in common. But it was the end of summer, so as I kissed her goodbye she gave me her phone number, and said that her mom took her phone until school started. So the day school starts I try calling her. It is the wrong number. Basically the number was off by 1 digit. But her friend found me on Instagram and she texted me. So months go by, and due to her strict mom she was never allowed to see me. It's important to mention that I started taking antidepressants at around this time, for reasons, and missing her was one of them. Anyways later I text her that I can't take missing her anymore and that I want to break up. She said ok and asked if we could still be friends. I eventually said fuck it and decided to take her back. Next week her mom finally let's us hang out.  And then later, we try to make plans for the movies. I couldn't buy the tickets in time and my stepmom was coordinating with my girlfriends mom. But my stepmom, told me a very surprising piece of information.

She's a pathological lier.


Now I brushed this accusation off quickly and assumed her mom was making stuff up. Until the next morning, my girlfriend send me very weird texts about my parents and me and her mom. They made literally no sense to me at the time. Then later she said she had to tell me something. She was lying about her mom. SHE WAS LYING ABOUT HAVING ABUSIVE PARENTS FOR LITERALLY NO REASON!! She said ""please don't be mad"" and I responded ""I'm just confused"" even though I was kinda mad. Then she says something about how she wants to break up. I've never seen this side of her before so I just blocked her because I didn't know what to do. Then the next day. I get an email from her friend that I forced her to kiss me and hold my hand. I was like, ""WHAT THE SHIT!"" and I had to explain to her friend that she was lying. Now it's been weeks since this has happened. And I still can't get over it.


Every time she texted me ""I love you"" or ""I miss you it couldve been a lie. I feel so hurt and broken. Any advice on how to get over her or just feel better in general??",27May2019,1

21,"have a whole lot of things that have happened to me. I want to package them into a neat box that I can name, because if I can name them I can deal with them better. Or at least know what the hell I'm dealing with.

I was a bubbly, energetic kid who made friends incredibly easily. 

I had an emotionally and physically abusive adolescent-hood. Because of that I deal with chronic low self-esteem, along with crazy performance anxiety that affects me daily. I'm 28 now. Been in long-term therapy for over 5 years.

When I was a teenager I became addicted to alcohol. I was assaulted while black out drunk more times than I can count. I had very high energy and would go out every night, but would cry and cry into the arms of a kind soul while blacked out and tell them of the terrible things I had to endure growing up. I've been sober for 8 years now. Not one drink. A psychiatrist diagnosed me as bipolar back then, when I was being hospitalized for my alcoholism.

Fast forward... I don't make or keep friends easily. My head tells me its because I'm not interesting or normal enough to have normal relationships. However, I have hundreds of acquaintances who all have a kind word to say about me.

I have no energy at home. I can't keep up with housework. I do not have the energy to keep building my relationship with my husband, even though I so desperately want to. I cannot take care of my pets the way I'd like. I dread going to work, even though it is just part-time while I wait for grad school to start. Which is the only thing I look forward to. I cannot force myself to exercise, although I used to be able to.

Some days I can push through the low energy. I'm guessing that most people wouldn't believe I'm depressed. When I go to work I can pretend very easily. I can goof off and talk about how great it is that I'm going to grad school in a few short months. Little do they know...

I had to put off grad school for a year, after a suicide attempt last year due to not performing well at work, which triggered some kind of episode. I was diagnosed with severe depression. They even put borderline as a possible diagnosis, which made me sad because I don't identify with it. I put my husband through the ringer. 

I've gained some weight. The other day I had a ""revelation"" about losing it. I felt like my whole body was bursting with energy just thinking about improving myself. I could accomplish anything. I could probably do it in three months if I wanted to. I was going to be the wife my husband deserved, the best therapist in-training. I was going to become everything I thought everyone else already was. Not so crazy, level, calm, not over-reactive in my interactions.

I feel kind of crazy with other people (other than family). Like I said above, it's like I am over-reactive with my words. Too full of energy, almost childlike. Even though that's not the way i feel on the inside. I hate acting this way. I don't WANT to act this way. It just happens. It feels like people look down on me because of it. I can't put words together very well, and sometimes say things that make sense in my own head but don't make sense to anyone else.

I cannot perform well enough at a job to keep it for more than a few months. There have been times where I called in more than I should, or HAD to take hour-long naps in my car during lunch because I was so tired, even after 10 hours sleep. Oh, but guess what. That could also be attributed to some sort of sleep apnea. Its always something else, something other than the package I want to neatly put all of this in. Which is so frustrating, because diagnosing mental illness means putting a bunch of symptoms into a package (DSM5), but it takes a really skilled professional to connect the dots correctly.

23,"34 years in, and I hear from my therapist and wife that I need to improve my self esteem constantly. I get it. The reason I’m tired of hearing it is because I find it impossible. Positive affirmations do not work for me, CBT doesn’t seem to work, being mindful is so hard with the constant physical feeling of anxiety. It’s hard to gain self esteem when your own body and mind betray you in times of need. Nothing seems to help, and I’m so exhausted that working on it feels like putting in hours that my mind isn’t capable of.",27May2019,1
24,"Over the course of the past month I've started seriously considering that I may be depressed. The thought has crossed my mind many times before, which I will get into more detail later, but I have been thinking about the possibility more than ever the past few weeks. This is going to be a very long and rambly post, apologies in advance and I really appreciate anyone taking the time to go through it and try and understand it.

First let me get out of the way why I'm not sure if I am depressed. Basically, when I am feeling down, I usually never insecure about myself or as anxious as when people describe depression and I'm as severely depressed I don't think either, which also makes me consider the possibility of dysthymia. I know that the only way for me to truly know is to talk to a doctor, but I want some second opinions before I take any action. For information about myself, I am a 17 year old guy in Grade 11 living in Canada.

My first experiences start in around February - April of last year. I started to feel very detached from my friendships and from myself, and where I used to be able to have natural conversations with others I started to have trouble getting my words to replicate what I thought. I started to become a lot more nervous socially overall and barely talked to my friends outside of school anymore. Most of the time I felt not depressed, but just slightly melancholic or just empty. The one thing that actually made me happy was hanging out with my best friends and not much else, I lost interest in things like playing games, reading, and watching TV. I spent a lot of time sitting around not really sure how to spend my free time and I also started to slip in school, I almost never did any homework and I barely passed math because I didn't study until the exam.

This feeling stayed and went sporadically leading me to believe that there wasn't anything really wrong, and events at the time led me to believe I was sad because of them. Those events were a close member having cancer, and me wanting to ask out a close friend which I could not bring myself to do. The close family member having cancer meant I spent a few months driving into Toronto from my nearby town of Georgina (I no longer live there) once every week or two. As for the crush, it's a bit of a stupid teen thing, but it genuinely made me feel bad because I wasn't able to get myself to take action no matter how much I realized that inaction was bad. I saw how I was finding it harder to relate and keep conversations going with her, or just get myself to talk to her.

The family member with Cancer had died in mid spring that year. It didn't affect me too much outside of the few days for the funeral processions, they were a non-blood relative and had married my Grandpa 30-odd years ago. Then, on the last day of school, my Grandpa died, and I found out my crush was moving away. This completely ruined me for the summer and I felt for the first time in my life like I was truly depressed. My end of June was filled with weeks of visiting family and setting up the funeral for my Grandpa and the entire 3 weeks is just a blur at this point, but again, it was event based so I never considered I was ""depressed"" depressed. For the rest of the summer I continued not having any real interest in my hobbies and only hung out with my friends maybe 5 times total. 

In late August - Early September I went on Vacation to Newfoundland, which is where my parents are from. While summer was ongoing, I saw the vacation as the beacon of light for getting me out of my summer which was obviously not going very well and that it would pick me up. That was true, I felt more happy than I think I ever had and I enjoyed my time so much, but during the down time I would feel melancholic and longing, not depressed but just slightly sad. This is when I started to question my mental state. I was in the place I wanted to be and having a great time with my family and I was enjoying everything so much but I still just felt slightly off when I was alone. 

After my vacation, I had trouble socializing at school again. I developed a slight stutter when I talked to people and I had trouble getting myself to respond when I was spoken too. I got myself hyped up over the summer that I would motivate myself and make this year better than last year, and actually try in school, but it immediately fell flat and by the end of September I already realized that my feeling of renewal from vacation had subsided and I was back to not really caring about school again. My parents brought up the idea of moving to Newfoundland in September since we all enjoyed it so much. I was completely on board. I only had one friend that I cared about and I felt like school was terrible, but I loved my time in Newfoundland and it made me feel happy. October was a limbo period of trying to get our house sold. I failed 2 math tests and had no real care about school anymore at all since I was leaving. My house sold in late October, and I spend all November home from school by myself.

I obviously felt very strange in this period because of the process of moving so I won't detail it because during this time I never once considered being depressed, just feeling this way because of the move. In November I cried a lot thinking about all my past friends and the memories I had of my town and all that, normal for moving after living somewhere for 16 years I would assume. We left in late November and I've been in Newfoundland since then.

Over the past 5 months, I have considered a lot more about being depressed. I love it here, my house is amazing and everything here is so beautiful, I made friends very quickly and I was living life like I wanted to be. It still all felt like a blur, and I felt very longing about Ontario and the past. Late at night I would be thinking about my old friends and it would make me cry every now and then, but I think that was normal because of the circumstances. I've had an on and off interest in my hobbies, sometimes being very interested in something for a short period and then not caring at all for longer periods after.

Now time for recent history. Many times since I've moved I have had a few weeks where I had constant non-stop headaches, I stayed home from school for those entire weeks and stayed in bed. Over the course of the past few months I have spend more time on my couch watching TV whereas in the past I would prefer to be on my computer playing games. I've been getting home feeling tired every single day and needing to go on the couch. The headaches and fatigue are what started around 3+ months ago and I didn't think too much of it, but the fact that my feelings of melancholy and longing were not going away were a red flag to me and by this point I am yet to be studying and doing homework in school, it isn't because I dislike school, I just can't get myself to care for some reason.

The past two months is when things have being very noticeable to me. I found a new group of friends and I've been hanging out with them a lot. They are the best people I've ever met and I've never felt happier hanging around with others before and I really relate to them. So when I take the angle of looking at how great my life is right now and how everything worked out so well after moving, I wonder why I'm not happier about it. When I don't have plans with my friends I spend most of my time lying down on my couch because I'm too tired to even sit up at my computer chair and especially not do any homework. This sometime improves and I'll use my computer more often for short periods. I quickly get drained of energy at school and I come home tired. Homework makes me tired and I find it extremely difficult to concentrate and completing any. I've also been finding it more difficult to socialize and be in tune with my own mind than in the past. I was better at holding conversations and talking to my friends and now I find it difficult to stay focused on a thought to fully sort it out. A few of my friends have described me as a boring person. 

I have frequent mild headaches or just haziness which has been on and off for the past year, and most of the time I don't feel sad or happy, just empty, like bored or tired. I don't have a hard workload at school or feel particularly stressed but I still get easily tired by the small amount of work, I don't get tired out when I do physical things like long walks or hiking so it's a mental thing. 

And here is the most major thing that has been happening to me that has never happened before, I'm not an emotional person and like I said usually more empty. While at home, I've been spontaneously crying for no reason. It usually happens at night time in my room, but one time I was walking up the stairs to my living room and I just instantly broke out into a huge feeling of sadness for a couple of seconds and then I pulled myself together, nothing like that had ever taken place in my life before. Yesterday, I laid down on my couch listening to a record and I cried 3 separate times for no reason, as well as another time during the day. This sort of thing happens at least once a week in the past 2 months, with a few weeks near the end of April being fine but then picking up in early May. It's been consistent and happening more often that not all month. When I took online tests about depression two months ago they said I was mildly to moderately depressed, for the past two weeks they say moderate to severe.

And I guess when you read of all of this it should be blatantly obvious but I'm still not sure what to think. I never feel insecure about myself really, never worthless and I'm usually quite optimistic about life overall. I've never been suicidal or thought of self-harming. I don't feel anxious in public and with those a lot of big things of depression that I never identified with I'm not sure. I know some people who have depression around me and when I think about how severe it is for them it seems that I am not that bad, because they've self-harmed, had thoughts of suicide and even one an attempt and anxiety and they have periods of being really detached socially and not wanting to be around others, where with me I never avoid my friends and I want to be around them a lot more, and I haven't heard anything about depression while still wanting to stay social simultaneously.

My Mother has depression and has told me that if I ever notice anything that I should talk to her because I could have it genetically. The past two months have made me very seriously consider the possibility and I know that I have to bring it up to her first, but I'm not sure what to say and how to bring it up. So I guess my questions after all of this jumbled ramble is based off what I've said are my feelings normal or marks of depression, and should I talk to my mother, if so, how and what do I say. Again thanks for reading through all of this it dragged out longer than I was expecting",27May2019,5
25,"So recently I found out that I’m very prone to hallucinations the hard way. I’m not in any way schizophrenic (thankfully) but I see things while trying to sleep when I’m under pressure or I’m exhausted even if my body funcions normally during the day.. And ever since I found out what it really is I’ve been jumpy when seeing anything similar to the things I see, seeing my friend in a funny filter that messes up the face that I should find funny and have found funny before triggered the feeling and I couldn’t look at it for longer than a second.

27,"When I was around 11, I had a sexual experience with a good friend of mine of the same gender. I don’t remember much except for having obliged quite readily and feeling extremely confused afterwards. Ever since, I have had issues with trying to start heterosexual relationships because nothing seems to feel as real. I think I suffered some trauma from that initial experience because I now have anxiety issues that surfaces whenever I don’t numb myself with something productive or drugs.

As I write, I am still friends with this person but plan to talk about this. I think it is the scariest thing I’ll ever do.

Hopefully that experience will bring catharsis, but I know -in a way- things will be harder from then on out.

30,"I'm alone in a very real sense of the word. My family and I don't have a good relationship that I can lean on. I have two friends that are only my friends because we live together. Everyone else is a friend of mine through my boyfriend which makes it hard to have serious and real friendships with them. My boyfriend is great and I love him to bits but a lot of the time he has to work through his own things and can't always be there to talk to me. I have my cats but they don't talk to me so its like me being in my own head still. I can't afford therapyx not that I have a real grasp on how I'm feeling anyways. 

I want to be able to talk to someone but I haven't had that in so long and my anxiety and depression is getting worse. I won't let it get as bad as it was before, but I'm scared I can't keep that promise for myself.

Because of my depression I haven't been eating well and I know that it just skips my mind. I'm either not eating enough or eating way to much. It's been one week and I'm tired. I don't want to spiral down again but I'm loosing my will to fight. Can someone send advice?",27May2019,2

33,"Doubt anyone would read all of this but oh well.. Im almost 19 years old and have been suffering from mental issues for as long as I remember. In 3rd grade, my elementary school assigned me a social worker to try to help me out. Everyone wondered why I never talked to anyone and always looked sad. I didn't like going to the social worker and used to complain to my parents about it. I think it was because I was shy or because I didn't want to be treated differently than mostly everyone else. After about a year or so I  told my parents that I didn't want to see a social worker anymore and they told her that I dont want that type of help anymore. I stopped seeing one ever since and whenever I used to see  the social worker in the hallways I used to purposely try to make myself look happy although I wasn't. My parents to this day and age still think that my emotional problems at the time were because of my discomfort seeing a social worker. Its partly true, but I indeed needed that help. Things may have been different for me today. I could have made friends (which I still don't have to this day). 

Also, something that bugged me is the special help I used to recieve. In elementary school and early middle school, I had to take special types of classes to help me improve on subjects like math and English. The tests were even ones that are seem as easier than the regular ones (they had 3 choices instead of 4). I remember a time in 5th grade when my teacher told me along with a couple of other studemts that I can use my textbook with my test. I immediately told her that I want to take the test like everyone else and pretty much made her speechless. She wondered why I declined an opportunity like that. Luckily in highschool I had am extreme improvement. humble brag but I managed to get a 3.94 GPA. Even in highschool I was given some of the ""easier"" version tests , but they stopped after realizing I don't need them anymore. I felt embarrassed whenever me and a few other people were given the special version tests. It was obvious, so most of the class knew. 

I see myself as a minority in this world that is unable to do what everyone else does in their daily lives. To this day I have anxiety for multiple things that are stealing away my life. Plus it has gotten way worse these past 2 years. 
I could write way more, but I'll stop here.

34,"I’ve been dealing with mental issues since jh, and I'm finally just ready to give up. I went to a therapist but lied the whole time to not become medicated, and i don't want medication because i’m scared its going to make me stupid or just ruin my way of thinking and persevering reality. I don't want that, but at the same time not getting help can cause brain damage. I would ask friends for advice on what to do but i ruined my friendship with the one person i call a friend, and could get help from.

37,"I’ve been trying really hard to open up about myself and my struggles and the more I do the more I realize how much I’ve just repressed and pushed away. 

I do this thing where if I start to feel something intense or think of shit I went through I get a song or a phrase hopelessly stuck in my head until I can’t think of anything or focus on whatever I was thinking about. It just happens and I don’t even notice until Im distracted enough that I avoid having emotions about whatever I was thinking about. It sounds stupid but it distracts me from feeling intensely. 

I really worry about what would happen if I stopped doing that - I’ve done it as long as I can remember. I don’t think I’d be able to handle whatever I’ve been repressing (or suppressing? Idk the difference). 

When I try to push through it, I just ‘shut down’ - I stop being able to follow thoughts and it feels like I can’t push thoughts into speech. My hands instinctively cover my eyes and I feel like I’m sinking into whatever I’m sitting/lying on. 

Tl;dr: I’m great at distracting myself and minimizing whatever I go though and am scared about trying to stop doing that.",27May2019,17
38,"Bear with me.

My english and my grammar ain't good, so I apologize in advance.

I'm gonna start by saying this; my family is fucked up. Way fucked up. Parents got divorced a few years ago, but I don't really remember them being close as a marriage.  and now my dad (who is borderline)  lives with his new wife. 
Sister (she's borderline, too) left us, 10 years ago. She still visits, in holidays. She has a son, but she doesn't really take care of him. 

That leaves mom and me. I do love her, just like I love my dad. They're my parents, after all. But in the past few years I've come to, probably not hate her, but just being uncomfortable and annoyed by her. She's 50, and has a lot of issues. Says she can't work, because anxiety, panic attacks and other stuff. She's been taking Alprazolam ever since I remember. 

I'm 24 years old, and for the past 3 years I've been paying the rents and some other stuff. I spend up to 70% of my income doing it. Now, I wouldn't mind doing this, supporting her (even if I remember her being distant) because I know it is hard living like that. I suffer from anxiety and depression myself, as well as derealization and depersonalization back in highschool. 
 
But living with her is awful. She think she's always right and knows better; she always victimize herself, and disregards other people's feelings or needs (except for my nephew's) to the point that she doesn't really asks favors, but demands. I could come home from work, and she'd ask for me to go to the mall or do something else. Should I refuse, she'd insult me, get mad and say I'm a shit and im worthless like my dad. She'd be mad and not talking to me for a day or two, and then she'd talk to me again, like nothing happened. 

Now, I know Im not a worthless shit, nor a kid, I can leave whenever I feel like. And that's what all my friends are telling me to do. Truth is, I'm not living my life. I'm stuck there, living stressed all the time. And the only reason I'm still here, is because I hold hope she can change (but if she hasn't changed in 25 years, I doubt she ever will) and because I think it's the right thing to do. But lately I've been thinking I should pack my things and move to another city, worry more about my health and my life- what little there is. 

And sometimes I think there's no point, that I'd be better off dead. 

I've been dealing with all of this and more, thanks to martial arts and football. But can't afford martial arts anymore, and practice happens while I'm at work, so Im left with neither.

42,"\[WARNING OF A LONG POST\]

Hello there guys. My name is Parker and I live in Romania. Eastern Europe, perhaps, if none of you heard of the name of the country, till' now.

I am 20 years old and I've been struggling my whole life. Well, you might wonder how or why.

Well, let me take you a while back.

I was a kid, about 4 or 5 years, I can remember to this day my parents got divorced, but just that. I vaguely remember anything from my childhood. My memory is quite good when it comes to useless stuff but I feel like life has passed without me noticing it. I didn't make any days matter. I didn't enjoy life perhaps?

My dad left with another women(her student, lmao) and didn't look back for about 7 years. I didn't see him. I did ask for him, of course, my mom had no response or some kind of lie, I was too young to understand.

I am giving this much information because I am yet wondering to this day if I have been traumatized by this incident, if this is the beginning of it all. If this is what made me feel, act and think this way.

To summarize and add a little more to it. My dad was using dumb females for sexual pleasures even though my mom was okay with it, this was too much. He left, my mom begged of him to leave the house we were living in at the time to us. But no.

He sold it and he gave like 30% to my mom. We were homeless for a few weeks before my grandma took us in.

I had a good childhood on the other hand. My mom was a teacher for about 20 years, I lived in a small village. I did not have a brother but my cousin. My cousin was my little brother. I lived with him, I almost lived for him. I enjoyed our time together and I'll always cry when we got separated.

We went to kindergarden, elementary school and highschool together. We played the same games, the same sports, everything. Although we were a lot different and we had lots of disagreements, we were always there one for another.

 I love him to this day, a lot.(He is currently in Germany with his family working his ass off as a courier).

&amp;#x200B;

So..I got to highschool. I moved from the small village where I knew everyone and I was socially comfortable with mostly everyone. I was a very fat and yet athletic type of guy. I didn't eat much. I was fat but and always had over the standard physical capabilities and that's why I joined the Rugby team of this school. I would have easy and short hours but 1 to 2 training sessions a day but...this wasn't the problem. The problem is that how aggressive and dumb(?) people were in that school. My cousin integrated very fast and I got left out for quite some time. I was scared, I was alone and most importantly I started questioning my depression at the time.

3 years passed and I got addicted to sport. I lived for it. It was why I woke up at 5 in the morning, go for a jogging session before training started. Was the first one at the stadium. Opening it up and training 30 minutes for strength before everyone arrived. 

I was dedicated. I fell in love with it. I got used to the people and 2/3 coaches were extremely interested and talented into our team.

I lost 18kg total because of how addicted to my body I was. I neglected myself and I have failed to enter the national competition to get a chance at a senior team to start off with a budget.

That was so far the hardest time in my life. Not any love/friendship relationship, which was quite unusual, for the people around me, at least.

I took a 1 year break because that's what the doctor told me to do so. Of course I kept training in my rhythm in the meantime because I would have felt guilt just eating and gaming all day.

I came back, finally. But the main coach refused to take me in again and give me a shot. In that moment, I have lost all the hope I had for a few years. Everything that kept me going.

Shortly after that I was still boiling inside and bad thoughts started happening over and over.

I ended up failing my highschool exams and with 2 suicide attempts.

I had friends throught the whole experience but I've never felt any kind of good emotion ever since.

I have a girlfriend to this day and I freshly moved in with her. I feel a little less depressed when I keep myself occupied.

But I still feel like I'm lost.

Gaming was always a passion above sport for me, but in the highschool years it has overtaken it.

I have lost interest for everything. I don't practice sport that much nowadays although I had periods of time since when I went to the gym quite constantly, it didn't help. Approximately 8 months.

If you are thinking about any ""specialist"" help. I  went to a psychologist for about 3 months and she didn't tell me anything I didn't knew.

I feel emotionless most of the time and I have begun to think it has something to do with my physical condition(?).

I feel tired, I feel uninterested, bored but yes. I have moments when I laugh with my friends. My mood can change although I have this constant dread mood 99% of the time.

I have tried to rekindle my passion  with gaming as well and tried livestreaming on Twitch, it turned out okay. I enjoy it quite a lot to do it but being realistic about it, I will never have an audience, I don't feel worthy enough. And I am disoriented where to start in the first place on making myself feel better and improve myself.

I have a job but I lack the funds to give a shot on studying anything for now. I can't really afford to pay something that I am not even sure I will give a shit in over 1 month. The universities here usually have an entrance exam and they put you to pay upfront most of the time. 2000/3000 euros are the one I looked onto, programming and art.

&amp;#x200B;

I am lost. I am not motivated enough to move 1 finger, almost as I feel comfortable in this mood. I simply can't bring myself to care enough. And I  have such mixed feelings about this because I blame myself for not caring and yet I haven't found a way to care more. About me, about family and about anything, in general.

&amp;#x200B;

So my questions resume to some kind strangers on the internet who thought reading all of this crap was a good idea. 

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? Where should I start? Why can't I be more emotional and I feel like I'm doomed onto this emotionless stage of my life?",27May2019,1
43,"I just recently terminated a five year close friendship for very good reasons. Lets just call him ""Jake"" to protect his identity. Jake is emotionally unstable and I believe he suffers from narcissistic personality disorder. I'm pretty confident in my claim because I've known him for five years, but I'm no professional and he refuses to get help so I terminated the friendship. I did this because he has lost his mind over the last five years and I see him as a very dangerous person. Unfortunately, I do not have any proof to back up these claims. He is also a closeted homosexual who is extremely insecure about it and has tried to make advances towards me (part of the reason why I terminated the friendship). Anyway, I'm nervous he will try and come back for retribution in acts of violence against me and my family. This person is armed and has a screw loose. Is there anything I can do other than nothing?",27May2019,1
44,"I have to apologize in advance for what is about to be a longer post. I just feel it is important to tell the full story if I want to get some help and prevent something that may have serious consequences. I also apologize for posting here, as I did not know who else to turn to. Since the question is regarding my girlfriend, I will try to explain her and our background in order for you to get a whole picture, since I myself am really worried I might do something horrible.  


To give you some background before starting the story, we met through tinder some 8 months ago and started dating about 6 months ago. I am 25 and she is 22. We had lots of insecurities about our bodies, with her weighing 130 kilos at some point of her life, and me weighing 120 through my high school years. We both lost a lot of weight by the time we met, but the insecurities still remained, so I wasn't that much surprised to find out I was her first boyfriend, and she was, although not the first girl I was in a relationship with, the first one I had sex to. This probably led to both me and her feeling strong affection towards each other. However, some 2 months ago, I left my home country to study abroad in Japan, while she remained in an small country in Europe. This is where problems started manifesting.  


Because the post ended up being above 15 paragraphs, I have included a short TLDR. Again, I apologize for the length, but I don't know to who else should I talk, as I am isolated in a foreign country. It would mean a lot to me if you read this through and give me some advice or opinion. I realize I have issues too, and that the whole situation is mostly my fault. You can also point my mistakes or suggest some help for me also, but I would like this to be mostly about finding a way to help my girlfriend and stop her from ruining or taking away her own life. Thank you very much for any amount of time you put into reading this.  


TLDR: Me travelling to study abroad has driven my girlfriend unhappy. She had some history of mental issues and this, combined with the pressure she feels from her studies, has led her to be more and more suicidal. She hurt me at some point, but I forgave her, after which we progressively started acting like we are together again. Now she sees me as the only good thing in life, and talks about killing herself it I am not around. She also physically hurt herself while on video call with me, and I was unable to stop her. I want her to consider her future and get some professional help, but she doesn't see the benefit and won't listen. All she cares is spending time physically with me. I need some help on what to say in order for her to get help and to avoid me hurting her or causing her to hurt herself.  


\-------------    THE STORY    -------------   


Before I describe the period of being far away, there is one more thing that is worth mentioning. That is our first trip for a vacation together. Some time before I left for Japan, we agreed to travel together. It was on this trip that I first saw her experience panic attack and act hysterically. Although I tried to calm her down, we ended up having a 2 hour long fight, after which we said sorry to each other and she opened up about some of her childhood issues. How her father used to beat her mother in front of her, and how that led her to not being able to believe anyone. She also told me that she used to go to psychotherapy before meeting me, and that she had suicidal ideas. Regardless, I still liked her very much, and wanted to help her as much as I could. Deciding to spend most of my remaining days in my home country with her. Some time before I left we agreed to see other people, as I wasn't sure when I will return, and didn't want her to waste her life waiting for me, but we also agreed to keep in touch.  


After I left, some 10 days passed where we would talk for hours, first through messages, and then voice and video calls. It was during this period she told me she loved me, and that she felt if it was only a year I am staying here, she would be able to wait for me. I also felt the same way about her. However, she also told me it is best we stop talking to each other, as she was feeling she is unable to see anyone else while we do so. That it would feel like she was cheating on me. I agreed as I did not want her to feel sad or trapped with me, as I am not sure how long I will be staying here after just 10 days.  


It was some 5 days after that that I called her and proposed we kept in touch, as I don't feel so good here if I knew someone who I very much care about is on the other side of the world, and that I might lose her. That opportunity is not worth sacrificing our mutual feelings for it. She was rightfully concerned about about the future of it if I decided to stay here. If I found the life here better, and somehow our relations deteriorated over time. Although I assured her that would not happen, she told me she was thinking of abandoning school (She is a first year undergraduate student currently) and that it might not be that unthinkable she moved in with me here, where we could have a fresh life. The idea I at first accepted, but after giving some thought on it, grew to see some problems with.  


Day after that I called her and we discussed her plans of abandoning school. I told her that I don't think that is a good idea, how people in a relationship fight even after years of dating and when they even live in the same home, let alone two persons who are dating for 5 months and are some 9000 kilometers apart. How, if she moved here, I would be the only person she has in the whole country, how there would no friends to talk to at first, and how life will take a lot of time to adapt. I told her I think she should reconsider her plans at least until I come for the summer vacation, and after that we would be able to see how we both felt about the whole situation. She wasn't to happy about it, ended up being mad and told me she wished I never called her suggesting we should continue our relationship. How I ruined her, and how she wished she can take back the time before the phone call. We didn't speak for the next two days.  


After the two days passed, she called me telling me she is seeing psychotherapist again. How she reconsidered her decision, and decided to stay in school. How she doesn't think that moving in with me is that good of an idea. Those were the things I was really happy to hear. However, she also mentioned how she slept with another guy before I called her suggesting we should talk, and how she slept with him again the night she told me I ruined her. I didn't feel so good about hearing that, but since she ended up crying and telling me she is worried she forever stained our relationship. I told her it is OK, and that she should not worry. How I still feel strong affection for her and that I somewhat understand it. When we finished the conversation, I started feeling inadequate and abandoned, unable to shake of the feeling.  


I talked to some friends about the whole situation as I felt all alone in that situation, and a bit used due to the fact that our last phone call finished on the note of me forgiving her for telling me I ruined her, and then turning to the other guy. How I felt like my feelings didn't matter in the whole situation. I spent the rest of the day thinking on it, and ended up calling her, telling her I do not want us to talk anymore. How I can't just sit there wondering if she is OK and being the one to help her with her problems when I know she is after that with some other guy. How I felt really hurt about what she said, and then, how I felt even worse knowing that after she said that instead of discussing it she turned to some other guy she, during that conversation, mentioned to be completely irrelevant. She ended up crying, begging for forgiveness and threatening she would kill herself. I spent the next 9 hours on the phone with her, just talking and trying to make her feel better, but in the end didn't really manage to achieve that. We agreed never to speak after that.  


After some 5 days I called her again. The period we did not talk I was worried and had trouble sleeping because of the way she felt. I ate nothing for 2 days, and found out that I have lost, due to all of the things that happened, 10 kilos in weight since I got here. I told her that I am over it, she shouldn't feel bad about it and that if she has some serious problem that she feels only I can help her with, she may call me. Mutual friend of ours called her to talk with her about some things, during which they discussed what happened. The friend mentioned she doesn't really feel any remorse for what she did, but for the way it made me feel. After that I called her again and we talked for another 2 hours about it and after that some usual casual stuff. After that, golden week started in Japan and I went on a road trip with some friends.  


When I returned, she messaged me and we started talking. I was a bit reluctant to respond as I was busy with some other stuff. She got mad about it as she thought of it as if I don't really care whether or not we talk. I called her to calm her down. For the next 6 days or so, we talked every day for some 4-6 hours per day, where I would stay up late, or get up really early to talk to her before she goes to sleep. She was lacking motivation to finish Faculty and I was trying to help her. After this period she mentioned she loves me very much, that she feels bad I can't really trust her because of everything that happened and that she will wait for me to come back. I was having mixed feelings about it, as I already got hurt, and didn't think us talking would lead to us being together. She cried due to my hesitation, so I talked the things over with her and decided I will put some trust in her. She was overjoyed to hear that.  


However, she didn't study much in the following days. She mentioned she feels miserable studying and lacks motivation. She mentioned also she stopped seeing psychotherapist and she easily broke down when I tried to motivate her to study more, saying I am putting a lot of pressure. Next 2 weeks were mostly filled with her lacking motivation and then calling me to tell her something that will get her to see the point in it. I wouldn't be able to do so, after which she would break down and talk about killing herself again, and then after 2-3 hours of conversation she would agree to try to study. During this period I suggested she should talk to some friend or family, but she mentioned the family doesn't understand her, and that she doesn't feel the need to talk to friends. How I am the only one she needs to talk to.  


Some following days she also had anxiety attacks and fear of abandonment. I had to promise not to turn out to be like her father, how I will not betray her trust. One day it even got bad she took Clonazepam to help her with anxiety, as I was unable to help her myself. She mentioned her roommate having also anxiety attacks, and, even though she is taking antidepressants, how due to the all the casual sex and going out, her roommate constantly feels lack of will to live and lack of purpose. She told me that talking with her roommate and trying to help her out drains her own and energy, and leads to her feeling worse by the day. She also mentioned how I am the only good thing in her life, and that without me she would probably just spend days thinking of ways to kill herself. How the only thing she cares about is me coming back in Summer, and how great the time will be that we will spend together.  


The last thing happened this morning for me, which is night time in Europe. I've spent the previous 3 days in another city where my best friend is studying. He himself is experiencing homesickness and lack of purpose here, so I spent those days trying to cheer him up and make them fun. That, combined with the 5 hours of travelling left me really tired the night before today. She mentioned that I seem tired, which I said is true, but that it will get better once I recharge my batteries. She also mentioned that she is sure about quitting Faculty, although she has no idea what she wants to do with her life. As our previous arguments on the topic always ended up with her crying, I told her I just want her to be happy, whatever she chooses to do in life, and that if it is the way she feels, I support her.  


Early in the morning when I got up, I found out one of the guys staying at my dormitory killed himself that night. That shook me up a bit. After that I got a call from my girlfriend who was a bit drunk. We talked casually, after switching to topic of me being tired last night. She told me how she thinks I got tired of listening to her. How I am losing interest, and that I am supporting her for the sake of supporting, even though I think that getting formal education is a good thing for her. I told her I am just a bit shaken by some external things that happened to me. How it is not her fault. And how I will never get tired of trying to help her, although at some moments I may feel discouraged, as it sometimes it seems to me that I am doing her more harm than help.  


She got worked up due to me feeling that way and mentioned that if it weren't for me, she would by now kill herself. How I am the only good thing that happened to her, and that she is afraid she is going to lose me because of the way I act, and how she is going to eventually destroy me with all the worries she has. I tried to make things better by arguing about the whole Faculty thing, where I mentioned that she can be happy without it, but she will probably have more opportunities if she finishes it. How bigger salary shouldn't be the motive, but more possibilities in life. She got so worked up and ended up having a panic attack, telling me I shouldn't be saying that, since she was finally at peace about dropping out of Faculty. When I mentioned that that is what I meant by when I said I sometimes do her more harm than help, she dug her nails in her thighs until they started bleeding. And then refused to listen while repeating how she is sick, human garbage, and how she is going to kill herself.  


I contacted one of her best friends after that, but since it was 2 in the morning back home, she didn't respond. Some minutes after girlfriend mentioned I shouldn't really tell that to anyone, and that she doesn't want me to worry about anything. I was really scared during that video call she might harm herself further, and I felt like I was living through hell. Thankfully, her roommate returned from a date some minutes after and managed to calm her down. She called me some 45 minutes later, after they talked it over, she called me to apologize, and to tell me how she loves me. When I told her I actually already told her friend what she did, she got really angry and we fought a bit over it. She said that she doesn't one none of her friends to know about the things that happen between us, and how I shouldn't tell anyone anything. When I suggested she should start seeing psychotherapist again, she argued that she would go if she saw any purpose in it, and how she sees no purpose in it since the two of us talk. She mentioned how I am her whole life again before going to sleep.  


I don't know if you managed to read this, but thank you if you did. I can't talk to my friends, because I hadn't talked to any of them about us talking again, since they were strongly against me ever talking to her after what happened. I can't get any professional advice here, since I don't know the language, and I am afraid that if I talk it over with her in a wrong way, she might hurt herself further, potentially even taking her own life. I do care for her, but I feel like the things that happened have somewhat steered me further from her, and that inability to express it clearly without the fear of hurting her just drives me further away from her. Also, I am not sure I am quite able to handle the responsibility of her life solely depending on me. The fact that when I am in a bad mood just worsens her state if I try to talk with her, instead of her trying to help me, makes it harder and harder for me to actually open up. I want her to get better and I want to avoid hurting her, or her hurting herself, in any way, but I don't think this can wait until I return home and talk with her in person, making sure she doesn't do any physical harm to her.  


If you can give any advice or your opinion on the topic, please, I need it. I realize my choices have led to her being in this state, and that I am mostly to blame for what is going on with her, but I want to stop the things from getting worse for her. She should be happy, and I don't want her to feel miserable or to feel like ending it all.  


Please, help me find a way to help her. Because I don't know what else to do.",27May2019,1
45,I will just be chilling watching tv or something and I’ll get up to do something like wash the dishes or cook etc but suddenly I get some weird feeling like everything zooms out and goes slow motion for just a moment then nothing feels real. Like I’m just watching a movie but I know I have full control I’m starting to get really uncomfortable about it  and the longest this has lasted is around a week,27May2019,4
46,"Okay, so I'm not sure how to properly format this or where to post it. I might be doing this completely wrong by posting it 'without his consent' I may post this on r/mentalillness subreddit,  r/teenagers and/or r/relationships cause I really want help with this and idk how to.
Also on mobile, so please forgive format, and a burner account because he knows my real account. 

Anyway, so me (M, 17) and my friend ""Sam"" [Not real name] (M, 17) have been close for a long time. Grew up togeather. But recently he's been really quiet, tired and withdrawn. He's stopped caring about appearance and now has a half-stubble and bags under his eyes. He just says it's Year 12 killing him slowly but he'll manage, and that I dont need to worry. 

Anyway, that's not my main serious concern. (though I'm really worried about that as well.) My real concern is he's stopped eating. Not entirely but he never eats at school and forgets most nights as well... His parents force him to have dinner with them but he ""doesn't eat much"" and/or ""doesn't feel hungry.""

He's been wasting away, he goes to a physiologist because of a bad breakup he had, but says he feels better, just that ""his body sometimes just decides he doesn't need certain things, like sleep or food for days or even months.""

He's had 'this' before with sleep and went 60-ish hours without sleep but that was cause he wanted to see how long he could function without sleep.

We're Australian, so school started for us a couple weeks ago and I haven't seen him eat at school once in the time we've been back. I'm really scared that it's anorexia or a food-related mental illness, but he says it's not, because 'he's not throwing it up' and not trying to starve himself to a certain weight/figure. 

But he is really skinny and pale, always tired and really quiet. We're in a big school, so no one else has really noticed. I don't wanna involve teachers cause then apparently he'll be hassled into eating constantly and he hates that idea of pressure. (I asked a understanding teacher, without directly telling him the problem.) Apparently, at least in Australia, they jump really hard on stuff like this, especially stuff like starving yourself. 

I don't want to involve his parents cause they're fiercely Christian and would just Bible bash him to help, which would prolly be worse. I'm at a loss, please Reddit. Any help will be greatly appreciated. Please. 

TL;DR friend doesn't eat barely ever anymore, am worried its anorexia or something similar.",27May2019,1
48,"I have a decent job working 50+ hours a week and I have been there for 15 years. I’ve been married for 9 years and we have a 6 year old son. Whenever my wife is around things seem to always work out. I believe she has to prompt me quite often to get things done around the house, but I have no problem doing these things. 

My wife is visiting family in another state this weekend so it’s just me and the little guy. I have a list of things to get done throughout the weekend. The weekend is over and it seems I haven’t gotten most of the work done. I could make excuses like it’s hard to get things done with my son demanding my attention all the time, or I’m just getting over a cold. But the truth is I just procrastinated and when I tried to start to do things I would quickly get distracted.

I’ve even failed at the basic things, like making sure my son and I are eating properly and showering. The house has become a mess of dishes and clothes and toys everywhere.

This is not the first time this has happened. Any time she leaves it’s like I forget how to function on a basic human level. Even now, it’s 2:00am and I should be asleep but instead I’ve been just mindlessly staring at my phone for the last 6 hours.",27May2019,2
49,"The memories are usually nothing too bad, usually just something stupid that I did or said. However, for whatever reason this has been going on for years and it affects my mood enough to make me go from feeling pretty happy to legitimately sad. In fact it happened while I was writing this post. It affects both my mood and self esteem a lot and I really want it to stop. Anyone have any tips?",27May2019,2
50,"The situation is very complex, so sit down, take a deep breath and follow me. Tl;dr at the bottom

I know this friend for about 3 years and as soon as we gained intimacy he showed up  some strange behaviours - such isolating himself, strongly hinting at suicide with a straight face. 

I believed him and i actively helped him through it even though we both lost many of our common friends in the process because of that. 

Our relationship has grown deeper (absolutely not romantic, but we now know about each other's dark sides, or so i think). He told me about how he suffer a severe deprivation of sleep and that he often has crisis (convulsions) that often require ER interventions. He claims to take any sort of pills (by medical prescriptions) for it and also claims they do nothing.

He also told me about how, in the past, having being bullied and experienced the death of his first gf, he had learnt to ""reset"" himself and ""produce a new version of himself"". Given that, he ""stores"" the other versions in the back of his mind and he is terrified they might escape. He also told me about how sometimes he dissociates from reality and experiences things with me or other people that eventually reveal false.

With all that in mind, i developed the idea he might suffer from a form of schizophrenia and a type of bpd, but being no expert i don't push myself further from that nor i propose him anything to treat it. I usually express him my concern and invite him to seek the help of a professionist. I finally always encourage him to not repress anything and come vent/talk to me whenever he feels the urge. 

Now i tell you why i sound so uncertain. 
1. He thanks me, he relies on me, but when i ask him if there are any updates with any therapy, he claims no therapist of sort can help him. He tried many, he said, and none of them have proven capable of help him. He says he continues the medical treatment for his crisis and for the sleep deprivation but everything is useless. 
I started long ago to doubt he actually looked for any help in the first place and i think he stopped taking pills long time ago.

2. I never experienced first-hand nor in person any manifestation of these episodes. I recently ended up talking with a personality of his but it all happened through text - no voice message, no ft, just plain words. 

3. It all seems built up. Remember the first episode? It didn't unroll quietly: he bursted in our chat group announcing what it seemed to us a final note. We then went straight to his house several times until there was no-one left but me - and he was there, unharmed, but insisting in declaring his purpose, in pushing us away, and then drop everything. I thought that was a progress. 

Now, about the second episode: i already mentioned i didn't see any of that, nor the slightest change in his behaviour, so i was informed directly by him (in person) about his state. He explained to me how it worked and what it calms him in case something went wrong in my presence. He also said that the other personalities reach out for him sometimes, leaving scrap of paper or other hints. Since we know each other, i know of two episodes in which that has occurred - one of them i already mentioned. In both, it seemed off to me that he highlighted strongly and in a lucid manner how oblivious he was of what happened. In the last one, what makes me suspicious is that the moment of the shift between his ""main"" and one of this personalities is so articulated and gradual it almost seems it's meant to be seen to validate the presence of the other. 

4. Although he brag he has some weapons that go from knives to synthetic substances, not only i've (luckly) never seen them, but the fact that he brings them up at random in the most innocent conversations concernes me. He also indulge in heavy violent threaths when he feels angry or someone does him wrong. It seems that some of them trigger a violent personality (that was the last case). 

Now you know everything. 
I now live in another city to continue my studies and since he has a few closer friends (all of them moved in other cities) we keep in touch but there's so much i can do for now. 
I've done my research and talked to a suicide line once (waste of time and money, the operator panicked more than me), hence i now am in the situation where i consider that everything he says and does might actually be true, but some details are strange and it might actually be a mind game he likes to play (he indulges in that with strangers sometimes). 

So far i acted like i was in the middle: he might lie, but it might be all true, so the best thing for me to do is to be supportive and watch. But the last episode rang a bell to me. Reddit is my ""last shore"", i don't know where to turn and what to do. I want to know if i should prepare myself to a big fight or to a scenario where someone end up killed (me, him or someone else). 

I'd like to hear what people that have actually experienced one of the two illnesses mentioned think, because i am extremely confused.

Thanks to have read all of this.

TL;DR: friend has told me of some behaviours of his that make me think he has schizophrenia and bpd. I am supportive and have encouraged him to actively seek help. Nonetheless, some things feel off and i am confused on whether believe him or not. People that have experienced/know someone with one of the two illnesses, what should i do?",27May2019,1

When I was 16(2010?) me, my mum, my sister and my dad(they hadn’t been together for 12 years) moves up too Great Yarmouth, whisky being up there I did leave the house for over a year and a half then we got evicted from our property and me and my dad went to live in a tent with the dogs whilst my mum and sister were in temporary accommodation. Not long after my mum got a new place and I went back there whilst my dad rented his own place during that time with my Mum I stayed in constantly and got my first every eating disorder from my addiction to gaming.

When I was 18 my mum came out as a lesbian and that’s never bothered me in the slightest, she ended up getting with a women called Kaye and a few months after she physically assaulted me whilst she was drunk and I always felt like my mum chose her over me. That was my first emotional breakdown.

The months after that I never left my room, I just spoke to girls online and that’s when I realised that I have a weird tick where if people don’t reply fast enough/don’t want to talk/stops talking after a while I’d feel really low and get very persistent. It always felt like I was obsessive or stalkerish even though I never wanted to do those things.

The older I got the more I noticed little triggers or impulses that I can’t stop, I always had an interest in my head I’ve always known I’m not wired like everyone else.

My mum always questioned why I’d always repeat the same things over and over again in an argument and not be able to stop, I always stated that if she thinks it’s bad listening to it she should try being in my head and I’ve always gone through life feeling content, never happy, never sad, just content and I’m very open about all this to my friends and family.

When I was 23 my ex misses was pregnant with my first child, a few months into the pregnancy I found out she was cheating on me from a month into our relationship and not long after that she aborted the baby. That’s when I had my second emotional breakdown.

I’m now with my current misses, she knows all my triggers and I’ve found workarounds for every habit I do that’s out of my control and the relationship is good bar the little breakdowns I do have.

I’ve got brandings all up my right forearm, I’ve suffered from eating disorders ever since I was 17 and I’m currently dealing with one now, I had a stage of sleeping with 31 women before my misses all within 3 years and none were with protection, I’ve always acted life my life isn’t a priority even though I know it is! I’ve thrown away relationships just because i could and I can have a breakdown that will last less than two minutes where I’ll hit myself several times in the head, burst into tears out of shame(because my misses witnesses it) and then snap out of it in a dazed like manner and I’ve always done stupid things on impulse(tattoos(you’d understand if you seen it) Saying/doing things that get me in trouble).

I feel happier in the darker side of my head but I know I’m a nicer person in the clear side of my head, I am currently going to the doctors for help to see what the hell is wrong and I’m hoping they can find the cause.

I’m a chill guy who doesn’t want to die, I don’t hate life and I want to experience everything I possibly can in my life but as my head gets worse I’m starting to believe that one day it might not be me who makes that choice and it’s starting to scare me.

There are things I’ve missed but this is kind of explains some key points of me and my life.",27May2019,3
53,"I don't even know what normal sleep is now, ever since I had a bit of a crisis a few years back I do not sleep naturally, I was prescribed sleep benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazapines to help following the separation of my partner and didn't use them correctly, because I was so low I was sleeping all through and staying awake at night, and sometimes just would bother sleeping at all (led to a psychotic moment that put me in hospital)

I lost my flat and was kicked out my family place because the drug abuse hot so bad so I ended up sleeping in my car for a few months, didn't have much problem sleeping in it because I was always on pills, eventually I got some help and moved into somewhere

Some of this stuff that I'm about to say might seem really awful to some people, but please try and see where I'm coming from with this. Using a throwaway because I don't want this attached to my main account. 

So , to get right into it, the first thing I've noticed is that I strangely find myself.. almost envious of mental disorders that other's have? But it's a strange sort of thing, because I realize that I probably wouldn't actually enjoy said disorder if I had it. For example, right now, someone I know has a disorder and for some reason I find myself wanting it, too. Outside of this, there are a few other disorders here and there that I've looked at, and for some reason every time I read about one I always get this weird feeling, almost as if I'm thinking a few things at once. 'I wish I had this,' 'I probably do have this,' and 'I definitely don't have this,' all at the same time, things like that.

And, in a similar way for some reason I keep finding myself wishing I were abused. For some reason I wish that I were abused when I was younger, and I also find myself hoping to get into an abusive relationship, for some reason. These feelings that I've mentioned have come up recently for me, I think because I've been talking about mental health related stuff with my friend, mentioned earlier, a lot. I feel like if we didn't talk about those things I never would feel this way. Hearing about disorders/trauma sets off these feelings inside me, possibly. 

I also just want to go out of my way to say that I would never pretend to have a mental illness. I suspect that there are some things that I could be actually diagnosed with, but for some reason it's almost like I want more. I don't know why. I'm not a horrible person, and I don't even really wish pain on myself. It's just a weird form of thinking that I have. I also want to say that I've thought about it for a while, and it's not because I attach some kind of value to those things that I for some reason desire. I don't think illness is cool, or anything like that. It isn't something that I can easily explain. 

I don't know why I actually posted this here. I just really, really want to feel better. And I think I just want to feel better about these feelings that I'm having. Maybe posting it here will be sort of like getting it off my chest. I don't know.

So I decided to make an Instagram group. The group was for people who were going through something or if they wanted to get closure or if they just wanted friends. 
The group was going very well and it became full. So now a buddy of mine and I run 4 groups on Instagram which have people who talk about their problems, help each other. I still get messages from people who wanna be in the groups.

So to start off it may probably be really awkward or cringe if i don't know what i'm talking about or just guessing, but anyways i have to ask. So its been like an year or half an year since i started just stressing about stuff who aren't on their place or it doesn't go the way i want. For example i ALWAYS have to put stuff that aren't staying where they should or else i get really stressed, another example is: i was in the shower and the shower head had water drops falling from it when i stopped it and i just wouldn't get out until i don't hit them at least 5 times which i actually succeeded in doing lol or sometimes i get uncomfortable when i write with uncapitalised letters like it would be really uncomfortable for me if i left the information up there for me in uncapitalised letter, 4th example is when i clean my desk, i won't stop until i dont see any dirt, 5th example is when im writing something and the letter turns out bad i would go over it with my pen until it becomes the way i want it to look (this happens with every single letter i make a mistake in).

The reason I'm writing this is that I often find myself repeatedly spelling out words or sentences in my head.

73,"Hey everyone,

I’m new to reddit so forgive me if I’m posting in the wrong place. Anyways as the title reads I am a 19 year old male who has never had a relationship. Over the past few months I’ve been going through a sort of depressed state. I graduated high school last year and took a gap year before college to complete BCT and AIT for the Army Reserves. I start college this fall now. Now that I am home and all of my buddies are home from school I’ve been sinking into a really dark place in my life. I’ve been diagnosed with depression in the past and used to take anti-depressants when I was a Freshman when my parents got divorced, but I got through that phase over the next few years. I’m a 19 year old who has fun with friends, does dumb teenager-coming-on-20 stuff, plays video games, works out and messes around with my car. 


But there is one thing that I don’t dare to let anyone find out about me, even my own parents is that I’m a virgin. (Even though I’m sure it’s extremely fuckin obvious) I haven’t even kissed a girl let alone touched one that was in any sort of romantic way. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I can talk and socialize with my guy friends all of the time and have a lot of fun with life, but add a girl to the mix and I lock up. I’m boring and depressing and drain the life out of every encounter I have with a female. I feel like no one ever taught me how to talk to girls. Everyone I know either has a girlfriend or is hooking up every weekend with a new girl. But then there’s me. I know it’s not that uncommon to be a virgin at 19, but it is definitley not normal to be THIS uptight and confused about having a simple conversation. 


This has been the main reason I’ve been thinking so dark lately. My life is going so well, but I feel like a void has been growing inside me that I cannot fill, and it’s causing me to think things about myself and other people that I never thought I would again. Being in the military I cannot have counseling sessions or a therapist. My parents are too busy now and I don’t want to bother them. I need some sort of advice but none of the “be yourself” stuff. I’ve tried that... I don’t even understand what that truly means. I feel like such a whiny bitch doing this, but it’s really the only way I feel like I can get some advice from some honest people who give a damn. I just need help to start talking to girls, I don’t need to get laid, I just want to be able to talk to one with confidence. I know this is why I’m feeling this way. It’s the only thing that could be making this happen. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

Recently I've been under more stress at work, and my anxiety has spiked as a result. That's happened before on sertraline and I've been able to manage it and not spiral out because the anti-depressant helps me not to go to those extreme places anymore.

I lie about everything at the moment.

The question may seem childish, but I am scared to death not knowing if what I am doing is right or wrong. Faced by different opinions everywhere, I am really lost in 99.99% of the things I do. Am I doing the right thing, making the right choice, behaving the right way? Is my response to a situation too much? Too little?  


Everyone tells me I am influenced too easy, but I am not really sure I have my own opinions anymore. I really don't know how to build my own opinions, views and morals because ultimately aren't all our morals inherited? Passed on by our parents brainwashing us since birth. Isn't that all what morals are? Lies that we tell ourselves and our children about what is right.

How do I know if the people I believed in all my life, people I idolized, whom I tried to be were right? How do I know if they are not flawed? Or their ideologies twisted? I did not feel it was wrong only until someone else did not put the idea in my mind and now I cannot get it out of my mind.

I've made a lot of strides in coping with triggers, taking care of myself, and gaining more control over myself and my life. The problem is that I still have extreme depressive episodes which can last days or weeks, and even with all the tools available to me (supportive friends, exercise, skills learned from CBT &amp; DBT, and now an amazing therapist) I am still plagued by these episodes. 

I have had no success in the past with SSRIs for treating these depressive episodes, but my therapist thinks the episodes are due to a chemical imbalance in my brain and therefore I need medication. She suggested trying mood stabilizers to help alleviate the depressive symptoms I struggle with, but I am seriously freaked out by the idea of taking them. A lot of them require frequent blood testing, which is awful for me because I'm a hard stick and have a serious phobia of getting blood drawn. The list of side effects for some of these drugs is pretty scary as well. 

Basically where I'm at is this: I know what it's like to cope with the depressive episodes as they are now. It's a familiar if deeply upsetting and sometimes self-destructive routine. Trying mood stabilizers will at least give me a chance to see what it's like to live without these extreme depressive episodes, but there's a chance they could make things worse (through side effects, me being upset that they don't work, or increased stress due to fear of my next blood test).

82,"Why do people ignore this framework when advising people to apply for jobs they've had, or live it rough like they did?

Is it possible that employers scrutinize resumes much more thoroughly than we realize?

No one mentions cultural fit or earmarks on a resume or in the person's demeanor that reveal social class.

A person can fall from grace a few rungs down. The cause can be anything beyond what traditional non-profits and shelter services see (and treat).

In that instance, a one size approach to problem solving will not work.

Employers look at the person's disposition, their demeanor, schools, where they live, how they carry themselves, and even their hobbies.

If the person used to go sailing and notices the picture on the person's desk or uses an example of it in an interview question that may reveal an expanded cultural background.

If they talk about traffic, or raising younger siblings when a parent worked, to explain their organization skills, that shows something 

Not everyone ""fits"" into the same work environment or job title.

But people minimize a person's accomplishments, income needs as though they dont even exist.

H.R. and hiring managers can turn people away who show desperation. A formerly high paid person who lost everything from (divorce, health issue, long term job loss, death in family), and is groveling at a temp agency or low retail job is going to be scrutinized.

Maybe that person has more knowledge than the hiring manager and the hiring manager feels insecure.

Maybe their H.R. sees the person will keep looking or for obvious reasons, the applicant cant support themselves on the low pay and cant afford the healthcare deductions.

Most people dont look at that.

i'm 26 year old female and i have recently been confronted with my exhaustingly low self esteem. i ended a LTR about 6 months ago, and I had spent the past couple of years in that relationship working on myself - 4 stone weight loss, and becoming overall more comfortable in my own skin.

what i have realised since being single though is the only joy i can find is in the affirmation from guys, and then particularly through sex. i can only seem to measure my success and value as a person against how many guys i can get to sleep with me. 

it's a terrible cycle because due to my attitude i am also initiating these conversations and meet ups on the premise of sex and the guys are then quite rightly not interested in pursuing any further which then makes me think what the hell is wrong with me?! i must not be pretty enough etc.

i went on one actual date with a guy, thought it went well, but after a bit of texting afterwards he stopped replying. so my theory that it was due to how sexual i was is now dead in the water and it must just be me there is something wrong with.

the problem is i don't find joy in anything but guys at the moment, can't enjoy being alone or being with friends.

it might be worth nothing that alongside ending my relationship i am also in the process of selling our joint house, had to rehome my cat, currently staying in my friends single bed spare room, just quit my job, will be moving countries in a month, and hopefully going back to school, there is a lot going on but i am fed up of being so fundamentally unhappy aside from the few hours here and there where i get attention.

A few days later my mom (who was there for the whole shebang) looked up the symptoms and that's when we found out it was a manic episode. Immediately scheduled an appointment for the doctor, who referred me to a psychiatrist. So I go to the psychiatrist and we talk for a bit and she asks me a boat load of questions. She asked me if I smoked weed, I told the truth, and she told me I needed to be able to pass a drug test to keep seeing her after that. Me, being the dumbass that I am, wasn't willing to give up weed at the time and never went back.

Flash forward to today and I'm 22, been fully sober for about 3 or 4 months, and haven't had an episode since.

But since I’ve been out the voices have been yelling at me to jump out of the car. Every time I get in. I know it’s not to run away again or to kill myself. But I don’t know why they want me to do it. Maybe to hurt myself? I don’t know but I find it so hard and terrifying to get into the car at the moment because I can just feel their anticipation (the voices) every time they realise we are getting in the car.

87,"Ive been to psychiatric hospitals/facilities about 7 or 8 times (i honestly cant completely remember) once as an adolescent, the rest as an adult. Let me tell you, if you dont go to the right hospital/facility its an absolute nightmare. 

My first time i went was hell. I was 17 and didnt actually need to be there, i was just stressed and being bullied and so i didnt want to keep living the life i was living and they took that to mean i was suicidal and put me on lockdown. I spent 8 days in that hellhole. They put me on about 10-15 different psych meds i didnt need, i was about 110 pounds when i went in and about 130-135 pounds when i got out, i was supposed to see a doctor every day but i only saw my doctor ONCE for FIVE FUCKING MINUTES, i was only allowed to have contact with the outside world by phone for 10 minutes each night, they put 7 year olds and 17 year olds in the same bedrooms with each other, they didnt give a shit about sexual harassment, they were cruel to us, i got in trouble for farting by accident (they wouldnt let me go to the rec room or lunch because of it), as soon as i got there they had to strip search me but the person to strip search me was a man (i was a 17 year old female), and the only way they would releasemy from the ""hospital"" was when i threatened to cancel my insurance so they wouldnt be getting any more money (as soon as i told them i was going to drop my insurance they immediatelystarted my discharge). All of that was just my first hospital stay.

The rest of my hospital stays (except 2) were short stays, about 5 days or less, and let me tell you DO NOT SIGN ANY FORMS WITHOUT THOROUGHLY READING THEM AND ASKING WHAT THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY DO!!!!! 3 of my stays were voluntary admits for non serious things and because of some loopholes in some forms they were allowed to hold me there against my will until the doctor said i was allowed to leave, the last time i went i had to literally threaten to sue the doctor and the facility in order for her to sign off on letting me leave. Warning number 2: DO NOT TRUST PICTURES YOU SEE ONLINE THAT MAKE THE PLACE LOOK AMAZING! My last visit i looked at pictures online and the place looked absolutely beautiful and an amazing place to get help with my issues but it was ALL LIES! The real facility looked NOTHING like the pictures AT ALL and it was a shitty tiny bungalow we were forced to stay in the entire stay. We werent allowed outside, we werent even allowed to go to the fucking cafeteria, they brought all our meals to us. It was horrible. Warning number 3: if you are concidering going to a short stay facility, DON'T! Short term stay facilities very rarely actually help in the long term, because 99%of the time you see your doctor and therapist maybe once or twice your whole stay and they do maybe two 15-30 minute group therapy sessions a day then just stick you in front of a tv the rest of the day. Instead consider going to whats called a residential facility (a month long stay or longer, my favorite is The Oaks At La Paloma in Memphis Tennessee (#notspon) theyre fantastic), they typically have you see your doctors and therapist frequently for longer periods of time, its typically on a campus where youre free to roam and not confined to a ward, you actually have access to the outside world, theres therapy and activities all the time so youre not just sat in front of a tv all day, and also the rooms are much better and you have an actual bed and real pillows and blankets. 

Trust me, its worth it to go to a residential facility if your insurance allows it or you can afford to pay for it yourself. I understand that its a longer time away from work and family and whatnot, but they really do help you there and you really will get something out of it. Ive had so many bad experiences at short term facilities but ive never had any problems with residential ones.",27May2019,1

90,"Hello, so I've been awfully curious and worried about this certain individual that I know very closely. He isn't really a harmful or rude individual, quite the opposite actually. He is known for being an introvert who is quite mild-mannered and polite in real life. He doesn't talk unless spoken to, so he overall is a very private person. How does this in anyway trigger this suspicion you may ask? Well how he thinks internally and acts in closed doors is different. What I state is based on what he has said to be and how he views things, if you were to examine it at surface value, I'd appreciate it.

Early Life:

He seems to struggle with being whether bored, irritated, or depressed. He constantly tells me life is boring and lacks any excitement. He used to be incredibly agressive and hostile in his later years in high school despite being bullied severely in elementary and having a rather chaotic household. Despite being incredibly intelligent, his teacher failed him because he lashed out at one of his teachers during class. 

He always told me he hates those around him and wished for their death. He has had traumatic moments that made him feel weak and vulnerable, and he despises it. He absolutely seems to hate and be disgusted by the idea of being empathetic towards others. That they all deserve to be used or killed in a way. He is not really machiavellian by any means, but he certainly has a very horrible mentality.

The emotions he explained he feels:
-Irritated (he feels that his life is directionless and wants control over it)
-Bored
-Depressed (he said he can cry about things, but he has to actually push it out, and it rarely ever happens genuinely)
-Minimal guilt when it comes to only those he values
-Angry/frustrated (he can let his temper out when he believes that others are attempting to control/hurt him, whether true or not.

He believes currently in his life that he has no direction to go really, and that since he is isolated from doing anything interesting or harmful towards others, he now lacks that admiration and sense of pride that his close group of friends would give him. Once again, he is mild-mannered, but nevertheless constantly having a chip on his shoulder.

The only time he has gotten in trouble with the law was when he dated an ex who dumped him and he decided to send death threats and actually attempted to plan to hurt/kill her until she told her family and he was investigated. Nothing happened to him from what he told me, but he simply felt like she was throwing him under the bus and that she didn't deserve to live.

I wish I could write more, but overall I'd prefer answering questions based on what I've seen about him and what he has told me. My question is if he exhibits traits that are anti-social in general?",27May2019,1

The person I thought I loved, has blocked on every social media site and removed me out of their lives because I felt they didn’t care about me, never defended me and was never there when I needed them but I was always there for them when they needed me.

I prefer to keep my social life and my friends etc. Away from my family. I feel they’re the only people left in my life who actually love me and care for me.

I hate to bring my problems up because I’m not that person, I love making people happy and I would hate to upset a person. I just feel so broken and upset and I can’t speak to anyone about it. I literally pour myself a glass vodka because I think it’ll make me feel better and sit crying to myself 

I play video games as a way to comfort myself and relax but I would always play them with my bf and now that he’s gone I just can’t enjoy myself anymore,  I know he’s playing  with his friends and probably his new gf too and I literally just play by myself with some music and no one to talk to.

But this schoolyear I was trying extra hard to get a 6.0 average (In my country we grade people 1-6 with 6 being the best.) and it was going good. I was studying so hard, and had an average of 5,79 by the end of the semester and was optimistic about getting a 6.0 this semester. But it got even harder, too many things to learn too fast and I am probably going to be left with a 5,23 average. And it's killing me. I keep getting 5's and my averages go down and down. And I feel so disappointed. I feel like I'm a piece of shit, and should die. A piece of garbage with no hope for the future. I was trying so hard, but still wasn't good enough. What else am I not good enough for? Maybe I'm not even good enough to live? I feel so shitty, lost and overwhelmed, but I can't talk about it to anyone. I tried, but my friends said not to 'fucking piss her off' and told me how she would want to have these grades and how about we exchange. People keep saying how it's probably all easy for me. But I've been staying up night after night studying and beating myself up for getting a 5 instead of a 6.

And I'm trying my best to maybe just get a 5,79 again, so I don't embarrass myself at the very least, but I don't know if I can. I feel so out of control. And I slowly stop caring and start to think to just kill myself because I won't do anything important in life anyway.",27May2019,1

97,"
I’ve already posted this to another subreddit, but I’m trying to find someone who can relate. 
Perhaps my issue is too abstract. Idk. 
———

I’m very unsatisfied with existence. And I don’t believe I can rid myself of these feelings. I don’t believe I am depressed. I think I’ve just analyzed life to an unhealthy extent. At least unhealthy for me. Perhaps I don’t have the mental fortitude to... dismiss the inherent issues within conscious existence. Im either in distress, or I’m distracted. Those are the two states in which I experience my reality. Distraction. Distress. I’m filled with hate and sadness. Both always accompanying each other. I hate myself, primarily. I hate humans. I hate human nature. I hate instinct. I hate that I hate. I have a short fuse. I need to keep it away from a flame. I think I’ve been doing fine with that. Well. When interacting with external factors, that is. Such as people. Other people. My thoughts, however, continuously light the fuse. My actions. My desires. A bombardment of shrapnel endlessly fragments my psychology. My fingertips sting in angst. I need a release. I can’t communicate my problems with anyone. I don’t like to talk. I can’t talk like I think. At least not to other people. I’m not comfortable with anyone. I’m not comfortable with myself. I’m not comfortable. 
I can’t share myself with anyone. I’ve done too many foul things. I don’t like the person that I am. No one else would either. The real me. Or at least the... consequential me. The me that has its hands on the wheel. I’m too fragmented to identify a “me”. I have good qualities. Qualities that define a ‘good person’. I have bad qualities. Qualities that define a ‘bad person’. So am I good or am I bad. I am neither. I am compromised; I indulge in it. Then I carry the weight of its consequences. Im in a very deep hole. I don’t know if I can get out. It just keeps getting deeper. Distress. Distraction. My fingertips sting in angst. I’m uncertain. I’m distant. From everyone. From everything.  Nothing has significance to me. Nothing feels real. Genuine. From the instinctual compulsion to reproduce to the dopamine-derived feelings of temporary happiness. I feel like a puppet.",27May2019,2
98,"I have bipolar II and it seems to be rapid cycling, but am not sure. I experience bouts of derealization nearly once a day and have learned to role with it. I can only liken it to going through a period of being in a fugue state. It happens all of the time and can often be distressing when it occurs during periods where I require serious focus (i.e. during an exam, while driving, etc). It happens when I play music pretty frequently and often when I am interacting with people. I feel like I am looking at myself playing or having a conversation with a girl I like or something. 

I was emotionally and sexually abused as a child and I think that has a lot to do with it. I can recall being touched a way I didn't like and going completely numb. I have been largely unable to talk about it outside of therapy, so it is particularly heavy in my mind. My parents are both narcissists and they neglected me emotionally and physically at times. I have a strained relationship with both of them and can barely help from simply checking out when I talk to them. My brain feels like it is floating about my head and I just speak often giving too much detail about my life. I have a hard time maintaining boundaries.

102,"My brother (25 yrs old), was a charming kid with just some social anxiety until late in high school he went into a phase where he starting smoking, dyed his hair and would steal money from our parents in his Junior to Senior year. He began isolating himself and started having phobias like a fear of chemical cleaning products, sunlight (he would hide in the bathroom covered in sunscreen), and many processed foods. He attempted suicide with pills and was committed on suicide watch. Not long after, he got out and went to college. He made some friends, and even lived with one over the summer until he became too much for his friend and friend's wife and was asked to leave. He now says he doesn't like them and stopped talking to them. He switched colleges 3 times after that, ending up doing online courses in an isolated house alone for about 6 months. He completed his courses but refused to get a job as a cashier, courier, waiter, or person that helped set up events because ""they were all beneath him."" After that, he lived in an apartment for a year, isolated, paid for by my parents. He has refused any visits but occasionally has come by for dinner. 

&amp;#x200B;

He now wears the same clothes every dad, thick corduroy pants and shirt with a strong odor of lanolin(a nasty smelling oil from sheep for hydrating skin apparently). He never makes eye contact, he looks at the floor. He's very thin as he is very health-conscience about what NOT to eat, so he only eats sun butter sandwiches and blueberries. He slouches to an absurd degree. He still has a phobia of the sun so he covers his face thickly in zinc-oxide(white &amp;shiny substance). I frequently get surprised by him just sitting in a dark room doing nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

He frequently tells people about his life plans which often change. Some include a walnut farm in Vermont, fish poop farm, just buying land with no further plans, and buying gold. He has taken all the extra money from his college fund and money from my parents and put it into buying gold because he thinks the price will increase and thinks its safer. He consistently urges younger siblings to not go to college because its a waste of time and its just what ""society is telling you to do."" He is resentful of my parents because they wasted all of ""his money"" on college, which is all their money in reality. If a movie or tv-show is on, he will say something like "" really is this what we do now? We just let ourselves be distracted and watch crap?"" He says he doesn't read books, he reads from thousands of people on the internet and that's how he learns. And he says he has ""discernment, and that's what wisdom is man, that's what it is, being able to see what's true and what's wrong and I'm able to do that."" (I'm not embellishing) At a moment like this, when he is further questioned, he'll become loud and angry and will say without fail ""you're all just brainwashed, you're just sheep, you don't have the courage to go against society like me,"" and then run away. If left in our house alone for a few days, everything is a creepy mess when we return.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, and most concerning, he has been displaying possible pedophilic behavior(not definitely, it might just be him not understanding social conventions). I have a younger sister(9 yrs old), who he sits extremely close to and wrapped his arm around sitting next to her. He picked her up when she asked him not to. At one point he started talking about sex. I don't allow them to be alone in the same room anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

His lack of coherence is insane. He can't form a thought that spans more than a few sentences. (I'm not making fun of him, this is true and deeply concerning.) I don't think we could ever commit him to a mental institution because he would truly believe they are trying to brainwash him. He refuses to go to psychiatrists. He's still living alone in an apartment and his lease is about to run out but he won't cooperate with my dad to renew. He has no current drug problems that I know of, he doesn't drink alcohol, and he used to be a pretty smart kid. I just keep trying to tell myself its not his fault.

103,"I was the kid that always cried in elementary school and each time my teacher was irritated because I couldn't help the tears streaming down my face. Yeah, I cried for the smallest of reasons but I was afraid that someone was angry at me. The other kids would look at me confused. I was the misfit in my class and had no friends for the most part of elementary school life.

At home, he'd hit us and I still recall that one time she said ""you can't show him that you're in pain"" because I had cried again. I tried to do what she told me but I couldn't always stop the tears. 

Now I'm older and I cry alone and in silence. The trust is broken and I envy happy and seemingly perfect families and understanding parents. I was sitting in a train once and there was a family sitting next to me. Father, mother, daughter and I was soooo envious because they seemed to have a strong loving bond. In that moment, I felt like I had missed out on something (to that family: I truly wish you all well, wherever you are).

So long story short - someone very close to me is severely bipolar/schizophrenic/borderline personality (no drug problems.. Just severely unstable naturally.) She lives in a type of group home. Its not EXACTLY a group home though. Its just a random house where ""they"" place psychiatrist patient's and drug addicts. They pretty much each will get a room and have completely free range living. They all live there for free off of state and federal funding/programs. A individual lady who, from my understand, is not affiliated with the programs directly owns this home, and a few others in the area used for the same person. She collects the funding amd pays the utilities and such. They tell the residences that rent is 600 a month - but no one has SSI, SSD or even medicaid for that matter. They all have case workers who ""are working to get them the benefits""... But nobody ever seems to actually get it. The patients/ residences have no curfews or supervision what so ever. My big issue is that certain individuals who live there... Who have serious drug problems... move random people into the home and ACTUALLY charge them $600 a month and they of course pocket this money.. And these people end up doing things like cooking crack in the kitchen. It leaves people with serious mental problems in a very uncomfortable situation, and they are often beat up. Of course the people who beat them up are arrested and all... But its a never ending cycle. They tell their counslers and social workers about the problem but it is never resolved. I dont know if its because the social workers are dismissive of the ""crazy"" people OR if they all really do know and this is kinda a huge fraudulent scam the police/ providers are complicit in.

Having children is a deeply personal choice and one that should not be taken lightly. Ensuring that you are financially able, emotionally stable, and mature enough to withstand the rigors of parenting is something that every person must do. All that said, how does one factor their own mental illness concerns into the decision?

Should people like Gabe and Michelle – one who lives with bipolar and the other, schizophrenia – have children? Is the risk of passing on the burdens of mental illness too great of a risk? Does having mental illness mean you can’t be a good parent? Where is the line?

On Friday and Today there was a fire truck. Again, no other vehicles with it. It stopped outside my house for about 3 minutes before I opened the window and looked at them. They then quickly drove around the neighborhood (it’s a loop) and stopped in the driveway leading out of the neighborhood. There was no fire and they went around far too quick to be helping someone. They were in the driveway for about 6 minutes, again, until I made it noticeable I was looking at them.

I sometimes notice cop cars following my car and policemen starting at me. It’s a cold, disgusted stare, not like how they look at most civilians. The cars follow us from point A which is 2 miles from the house to point B which is usually 7 miles from point A. Once we park they’ll drive off, they follow us into the lot. 

Did I do something wrong? Did I break the law?

114,"Lately I've been having a lot more energy and doing more things than usual. It's not like a ton of big stuff, mainly life things I havent gotten to like renewing my license, renewing my debit card, getting a credit card, finding new doctors/clinics, making appointments, making tattoo designs and make an appointment for that, getting piercings, going hiking, going shopping. That pretty much all I've done over the last week as well as a few shifts at my part time job. I know its not a ton, but normally all I do is sleep and work. I've been sleeping less, I dont count how many hours but its not like a super small amount, just less than I normally do, and I dont get tired in the day like I usually do either. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just worried because also I have major breakdowns too. The last one was last tuesday, where I purposely overdosed on a med that I knew would really harm me so that I could go to the ER and maybe be hospitalized. I did that because I felt like there was no other way to get help. But I'm fine now, happier than normal. 

I'm sure Im missing some major things, but in general everything ive been doing and feeling just doenst seem normal to me. Maybe its because I'm just not used to being happy, or something else might be happening. Like, Im happy and I love it, but Im just suspicious becuse this isnt really normal for me",27May2019,1

116,"I have a history of experiencing problems obliviously for very long periods before having revelations, I've recently come to the conclusion that the problems I've been dealing with for almost all of my teen years are due to me having bipolar disorder.

\- I'm sometimes very creative and could put out very good work, especially writing and poetry, but most of the time I'm unable to satisfyingly generate my own material. I spend hours reading about and watching videos on worldbuilding, but when I try to start doing it myself, I never enjoy it, even though I love thinking about it and contemplating the idea of it. My Google Docs is a graveyard of barely-started documents.

\- I generally find it difficult to study school subjects or practice instruments.

\- Whenever I try to analyse myself (even for things like this; for example, trying to recall whether I experience clear shifts between mania and depression), I often hit a mental block. It's like I can remember events, but I can't really track my feelings or mental developments? I often feel like I can't solve moral problems at the moment, and I very often doubt myself, especially when I'm arguing with someone.

\- I never get hateful, and rarely angry, but I often feel needlessly irritated by things people say and do, and that feeling can stick with me for a few hours.

\- I find it very difficult to think of people, sometimes even things, negatively (though this might just be my personality)

\- I find that the people I have the most intimate friendships and discussions with also have mental disorders (bipolar disorder, major anxiety issues, etc.)

\- I sometimes think much more sexually than usual.

\- I can be extremely forgetful and oblivious.

\- I sometimes have difficulty focusing in class.

Sorry, this turned out much less cohesive than I wanted. I'm seeing my GP on Friday, but I just wanted to try and get some opinions. Does it seem like I might have some sort of mental disorder?",27May2019,2
117,"When I was younger I used to play the Sims for hours and hours. Today I listened to an episode of the podcast Reply All called Autumn (#129) (or same story in episode Saving Grace by podcast The Nod). This woman used to not have emotional support at home or at school and would feel very alone when she was a child. Creating loving families and making loved ones alive again in the Sims made her be able to feel loved and like she belonged.

My own Sims addiction back then has probably got to do with similar feelings and made it possible for me to make everyone happy and living perfect lives, fulfilling all their dreams. When I talk with friends about Sims they don't seem to get it. They used it to decorate perfect houses or just kill their Sims in pools.. so I have not found very relatable experiences untill I found that particular podcast episode.

I am very curious to hear if other people used the Sims in similar ways or if anyone has any other content that discusses the Sims as somewhat therapeutic/coping mechanism.",27May2019,152
118,"Let me introduce you to the most ridiculous country in Europe when it comes to the flawed school system - Slovakia. To begin my story I need to give you some background about me; I have dyscalculia and despite having normal intelligence I am hardly able to count 8+9 and it takes me forever. Simple math tasks are impossible for me and I lack logic when it comes to numbers I just don't get it no matter what. This has been an issue my entire life; getting the best grade from all subjects and barely managing to pass math at the gymnasium, being embarrassed because I was the worst among the worst despite studying math a lot and practicing. I just memorized everything related to math basically.  I used to have really big complexes about my ""math skills"" but I know it's not my fault, I was simply born like this. Anyways time has progressed and I managed to get a bachelor's degree in psychology and went for master's but my mum suddenly died and I could not go to the finals. So basically we are here in my situation right now - I retook the final year for only state exams. 

There is the thing- except writing a bachelor/master thesis in Slovakia you have to also have to do not just normal finals after semester, but also bachelor state exams from the same subjects you had over years (same goes for master exams). It's an insane amount of theory (always over 500 pages of bullshit) with no practical use and I had already taken those exams from these subjects but yeah, Slovakia...

Now to explain the flawed system more - you have to present your Master's thesis in front of the commission of 5 professors and all your classmates; state exam is hardcore and they don't even go according to syllabus and pick random themes from previous years even though we should not have studied them in the first place. You go into the room with 3 more people and whilst they are talking you are preparing after you draw the question (yeah imagine the focus when your classmate is actually orally answering in front of commission). 

I had studied vigorously past three months and was self-confident about all subjects. I managed to revise around 4 times too. I had always had good grades (until now). I made some preparation after I drew the questions from all three subjects and then after 20 minutes I had to take an oral exam. 

The first thing was that I failed to answer one subquestion out of three for one subject and they did not try to help me at all or lead me; at least one word associated with it would be enough. Nothing. I was like, hmm, kay, I mean I answered 2 subquestions out of 3.

After that, I actually answered pretty well questions about personality disorders but they did not want me to describe them or anything even though I wanted to. They basically were like ""thank you next"" (not polite just Ari reference). 

Then the incident happened- we came to the question about intelligence tests and I knew every single test there detailed and even subtests for them and even mentioned history about first measuring mental age and then intelligence quotient. And here we go- one professor started asking me about the formula on how to get IQ from mental age or something like that. Me being absolutely dreadful, unable to think about numbers or calculating anything started panicking. He kept asking and asking, said it was easy (that was THE ONLY thing I did not know by the way from the intelligence tests questions) and I started feeling bad and said that I have dyscalculia. They are all psychologists, some of them even clinical ones or counselors. Anyways he kept trying to make me CALCULATE what is 8x4 to actually calculate IQ according to the mental age of the child after I clearly said I have dyscalculia and can not grasp this. I knew that such formula exists but I just could not logically find out even though it might seem elementary (in that situation being so stressed and pressured I had total brain fog and it wasn't in the notes). I started crying and being emotional because he kept pressuring and asking me to say what is 8x4 and 4x8 (like four times). I finally manage to say the number (he kept asking me this through me crying and saying how I can't count because of my disability). All math operation I have ever known were learned through memorizing, even the simplest ones. I can not do normal math operation like 8+9-7-2 or it's so delayed compared to the norm that it's insane and it has been decreasing my self-esteem for quite a while. They basically asked only about two intelligence tests and I put a detailed description and then they basically sent me away (despite me perfectly saying tests).

I was crying afterward for 2 hours because I remembered how I was ""the dumbest"" kid at high school in math, even people who weren't good at anything had better grades etc. I always took extra classes and tried to get help with math but to no avail, it was all futile. I just could not do the math. A few weeks ago I said to my bf that I can't count, how can I ever work anywhere with this severe math disability so it's really ironic. Anyways it really hurt me, it seemed like these people feel no empathy whatsoever despite knowing really well my condition because he even talked about ""kids like me not being well integrated"" and of course they are PSYCHOLOGISTS. 

Anyways they called all my classmates in and read the results after everyone was done; of course, they did not let me pass from the subject where I knew 2 out of 3 questions and barely let me pass the last two despite knowing the majority information there. Now I have to retake this exam in August and I absolutely lost confidence in myself. I had been studying so much past months and trying to integrate my knowledge deeply before I took this exam. I went there prepared and ready, confident. I came out from there completely broken with lowered self-esteem and like a victim of unfair treatment and injustice. 

I don't know what to do.  I lost all my confidence and I'm completely traumatized because of that math incident; I am thinking about starting cognitive behavioral psychotherapy because I feel like I won't be able to go there in August to retake this exam.",27May2019,1
119,"So I’ve been getting counseling for “low mood” and put on anti depressants for “low mood”. The doctor keeps telling my mom that these things will help with depression but Nobody is saying if I actually have depression.

The doctors keep mentioning depression but I’m stressed out not knowing what I’m taking prozac for and what the hell it means when the doctor does air quotes and says low mood. 

If they don’t know if I have depression why am I being given medication? Or are they just not telling me.

Right now, it feels like physical pain is the only way to take my mind off of it. I've been hitting my head against desks, books, and literally anything that doesn't feel like it's damaging my skull. Today I lightly cut myself (I don't mean to make a habit of doing it, don't worry) and I keep imagining myself stabbing my arm with a screwdriver (I know that sounds weird but it's true). Even while I'm writing this now, I just feel stressed and completely done with everything. I think a portion of this feeling of utter-shittiness can be attributed to the fact that I have some major feelings for this girl (which is also weird as shit because I despise relationships) I feel breathless and tense when I think about her or see her, but tomorrow I'm just speak to her about it and get it off my chest. Hopefully that'll be *some* weight lifted off my shoulders.

long story short I accused my girlfriend and one of my friends of being a bit too close if you get me she obviously didn't like this so we ended up arguing, leaving and missing the rest of the festival, now I've lost trust recently with said friend for a few reasons most recent being him cheating on then breaking up with his ex then moving on within a week so I felt uncomfortable with him around her but she's never given me reason to think she would cheat which is where the guilt comes from.

127,"Okay to start with, I have had some trauma in my past. I have also done pretty shady things in my past so I’m not a saint either. But I have put myself on the right track until last year when I took a job that skyrocketed my anxiety. I then had to come to the realization that working out and working hard (literally) doesn’t solve all the issues of abuse and trauma. 

I opened up to my mother and she wasn’t exactly supportive but that’s fine, I expected that. 

But here’s the thing, my own mother has said some pretty shitty things to me all my life. Basically, I’d never amount to anything...she’d be fine if my life was fucked because she had two other daughters and the world wouldn’t judge her and a whole bunch of other things. That said, she is by all standards a good mother. She raised three kids as a single parent. 

I took all my experiences and everything that’s been said to me and channeled it into improving my life. Anyway I was invited to Memorial Day brunch with the entire family including my oldest sister, her husband and two kids. I do not like the husband but who cares, they’re married. 

But I just couldn’t stand how I have been treated my whole life. I am pretty much the black sheep. For some reason I couldn’t stand for the fakeness anymore and brought up everything that’s been said to me after my sister made a snarky comment. 

I confronted her in front of my mother and tried to explain the whole situation. At this point, I was already livid and hyperventilating. My mother basically said I had paranoia. That one hurt and while she may not have meant it, it directly referred to the issues I told her about.

They are my family. I can’t divorce them. Actually I can but what the fuck. I don’t want to do that. At this point it seems like I’m the one causing problems in the family. I am working on my own issues but that woman has said some ungodly things to me. And while she may think she was saying it to motivate or wake me up, those things cut like a fucking knife. In some ways, it’s made me who I am. 

TLDR:

Am I wrong for trying to get them to acknowledge how those things have affected me or just let them be and continue my therapy. But it’s so fucking annoying that they all want to be proud of me now when they all thought I was down and out and those years.",27May2019,1

I'm 19 and I can't seem to find a job  and my mom dead two years ago so I'm stuck with my father this wouldn't be a problem

But my dad is not mentally well
There's a listen of things i think he might have but I'm not 100% if he has some of them

He is also mentally abusive towards me, and just generally wants me to force me to be with him since i have no money and no one will hure me for a job I'm stuck with him

Since i was young he would show signs of narcissistic

He'll get mad over me not learning quicker then i can
He get jealous of me being with friends enjoy to make he ruin my friendships
His gaslighted me several times
He has serious lack of empathy
And even now his relying on me to pay bills even though i don't got a job and I'm having horrible luck getting one

And if that wasn't enough i am also to believe he has paranoia personality disorder

His always had a lack of trust i remember when i was a kid i didn't even want to go out of my room cause he would find reasons to blame me and punish me for things i wouldn't even do

He would constantly say how he does trust family members even if they where trying to help us

He would get mad if you suggested he needed to go to get help because he had mental problems and would snap at you for it

He constantly doubts people's loyalty and trys to find fake proof to call them untrustworthy (his been doing that a lot with my boyfriend and other friends) 

He always blames others on situations that he caused

His extremely stubborn like to the point of risking his life 
(what happened was he was in the kitchen and he fainted when i went to check on him he woke up he said he didn't need to go to the hospital even though i was practically begging him to go the next day he didn't feel good and he finally went to the doctor and they told him his heart stopped for a moment)

His been getting worse lately 
And I've even seen him do things 

Like some nights he would be alone in his room and i would hear him speaking like he was talking to someone and i know his wide awake 

He would offend uses sweet voices or even irritated and angry voices

About our past well
My mom used be mentally and physically abusive towards both me and my dad she was a bipolar narcissist   

She would try and hit me make up stories about how horrible i was and even said she wishes she could give me away or never had me

She would boss my dad around to the point where he had anger management problems and would take it out by yelling at me 

And don't get me wrong i wasn't too horrible of a child i had really bad issues learn cause they didn't want to take the time to teach me or would get mad if I didn't learn quick enough so i had to do it all on my own 

But other than that i did dishes and every chore in the house basically their sleave and in my free time i would draw or play video games or even relax on the computer 

No one really bother me or even try spreading time with me unless it was forcing me to do things like chores or getting mad at me for something i didn't do

My dad would rely on my mother's pay check and my mom soon stay home cause she was getting paid for disability  she died 2 years ago and since then we've been poor 

My dad survived death more than once 
And he is now extremely depressed by my mother's death but again he doesn't get much help for it

Now he just sits around in his bed room watching YouTube and looking at Facebook all day 

I want to get a job and move out cause I'm extremely mentally exhausted of how he treats me but at the moment i can't find one and I don't have many friends thanks to my dad so no one to really live with and he pushed all my other family members away 

How on earth could i deal with this situation? 
I don't have hardly any education i was homeschooled 

My main issue with getting a job is no experience 

And my dad i don't even know what to do about him",27May2019,3
143,"I don't know how my condition is named in english. i have a mental age that doesn't match my biological age, it used to be troublesome but now I have accepted it.

this is post is not an AMA but a vent, im smart so many people don't believe me when i tell them what I have. For example Im 23 but i still like watching pokemon cartoons. Maybe anime is socially accepted,but I like stuff kids like.

that's just it, I wanted to vent off. any support is welcome. I tried to die once but survived.",27May2019,1
144,"I just really need to talk about this because I'm freaking out right now.

So for a long time now, I've lived sort of halfway between reality and fantasy. I always imagine fictional characters as if they're real and spend a long time talking to them. Admittedly, this started mostly because I didn't have anyone I wanted to talk to about personal issues, but it's become sort of a daily thing that isn't really there for me to vent anymore. I constantly have to refrain from turning to these characters and commenting things when in public/with people. I know there's no one there and they're not real, so it's not that I'm confused because of that. It's more like... The reality I'm living in doesn't seem real to me so I forget that everyone else isn't privy to my daydreams. My friend who has an anxiety spoke to me one time about things not seeming real to her and having an almsot out of body experience (it hadn't happened to her before at that point and hasn't happened again). It kinda reminded me then that this isn't actually a normal thing that people experience every day. She was just experiencing that then, but it's like that every day for me. 

To be honest, I often feel like life isn't really real? Like I really genuinely question sometimes if the people around me actually have autonomy or whether they're all just figments of my imagination. Sometimes I feel like I'm the only person that's actually real, but even then I don't really feel real myself. It's like I don't really have control over my physical self. I'm more living within my headspace, halfway between reality and daydreams. I also don't really have any connection with my identity. Not even my name seems to fit me. When asked to describe who I am as a person, I really genuinely don't know. Because of that, it's difficult to connect with people. If I don't even know who I am, how can people get to know me? Is there even someone to know? Like that, it's become even more difficult to communicate with other people, even those I've known for years. I feel lost a lot of the time. I never used to have any problems with speaking either, but now it's as if I can't get the words out anymore. I don't just struggle to speak to people anymore, I also struggle just to speak in general.

But I digress. I kinda... Broke down today because of this. I was playing a game and a character did something that really annoyed me and so I kinda had a rant about it. I pretended I was speaking to that character and trying to explain to them why i took issue with their actions. But this led to me talking about my own past in order to better explain and I ended up breaking down crying for a long time. I haven't cried out loud in ages. I usually cry pretty silently as in just tears and no loud sobbing (unless I'm actively trying to talk to someone whilst crying, which is rare and usually over non-real things like a character dying in a film). I don't know what it was, but I was really... I just couldn't control my crying. It was like I just broke or something. I haven't thought about that time in depth for years and I'm mostly over it now. It wasn't even that serious, but for some reason I reacted like that. Apparently, I'm not really over it... Or maybe I am but the reminder just got to me. That wasn't the thing I really freaked out about though. 

Even though I was crying and breaking down, it didn't feel like it was me doing it. I had been imagining the conversation so even my reaction felt imagined, as if I was just reacting within the confines of the story. Even though I was breaking down in real time, in real life, my mind was still preoccupied with the fantasy. I found... It was difficult for me to separate myself from it even though it was really me being affected and not the character I was playing.

I just... I don't really know what to do. Part of me thinks this can't be healthy, but I also just don't really have the capacity to care. It's not really a big deal, and I'll be over it soon, but that really threw me... I didn't expect to react so intensely as that. Even now, I'm not really present anymore although I vaguely was before. Idk maybe I should just sleep ;;; I just kinda needed to rant for a bit because I'm not really sure how to react after that. Like... Is this something that should be distressing to me? Who knows, I guess.",27May2019,2
145,I relapsed today after staying clean since December. I finally caved n didn't stop until the blade was dull. I feel so fuckin weak and alone. I don't know what to do anymore.

146,"3 days ago i started the process of tapering off of effexor 75mg.

I was on it for about 5 months, it made me no longer depressed but i still had no motivation, no appetite, constantly tired yet unable to sleep, and in the end the benefits didnt outweigh the side effects im having so the dr and i decided its time to taper off.

I was put down to 37.5mg for a week this week, then every other day for a week and then i’ll be off of it.

I’m just having a really hard time already tapering off, its only been 3 days and i’ve had the worst sleep, i’m so foggy, full of confusion, tired, and i cant stop having crying attacks. I’m so over this already and all i want is this to end sooner than later. I feel like i’m just going to feel like this forever now. Its terrible. 

It just feels like its never going to end :( 

I know i have to suck it up but god damn, medication sucks sometimes :(",27May2019,1
147,"I haven't been feeling mentally well recently. My confidence is close to an all time low,my work is very stressful and demanding and my social life is almost non-existent.

I either remain in this or move to a place that makes me feel better in general and where I have close friends. I need to decide as soon as possible while I'm at my new job for less than 3 months so I can quit at any time. Afterwards, I will need to give 2 months notice. 

It would require a lot of paper work, moving, flat searching, job searching and adapting back to that town. And I'm not sure I can do that now. But if I don't, next good opportunity like this will be in a year.

I'm not happy and I'm not content in any part of my life but I'm worried moving would make everything worse. But just being in that town for a weekend has filled me with hope and calmness I haven't felt in a long time.",27May2019,1

NO, ugly people DO EXIST it isn't only something ""subjective"", BEAUTY is subjective, ugliness most of the time isn't. I know that I'm ugly and really dumb and as much as it hurts me, I accept it. What I can't tolerate is people lying straight to my face saying ""oh you're not that ugly"" or ""you're not dumb at all"" just please stop with the fucking lies it makes things WAY worse for people like me, WE KNOW, you lying hurts more than you being brutally honest...",27May2019,3

Interacted with family/ friends today for a few hours but am just tired and need to chill and rest but I feel like sometimes I spend too much time by myself.

151,"Hello, hope you are all doing well. I'm trying to find some leads for a different type of work than what I'm doing. I figured that asking three very relevant boards would be a good place to take back up the research, since you all have heard of a great many services, professionals, and programs in your life and regions. Basic web searching has not been yielding much.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The main thing I'm trying to understand right now is what sort of jobs exist in the ""helping field"" that are  seasonal, short term contractual-type working positions. What comes to mind right off are summer camps for people with disabilities. I'll look into that area in general, but camps can't be the only option in America for this. It doesn't matter to me where this job would be at, I'd even love to hear of things outside of the ConUS. Like I said I just need to hear examples. Any sort of interesting self employment you've seen would also be great to hear.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My info to consider, with experience in order:

26yo male with bachelor's in psychology.

entry level retail work experiences

a few volunteering and organizational experiences

6 mo. residential tech at facility for dual diagnosis teens

6 mo. and counting on the mobile crisis response team for suicide hotline - working with licensed clinicians

Some certifications and trainings relevant to those last two positions.

I'd like to get 2 years experience on the crisis team, especially since the previous stuff is so spotty.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to learn about the possibility of a seasonal job still in this field because I want to be able to travel for weeks or months at a time. I figure with my experiences and skills it's worth looking into this first before considering seasonal or self-employed ventures outside of the psych field. But ultimately anything that's a good fit is on the table.

152,"starting to notice an influx of people using this subreddit to whine about their jobs and life, when that is actually okay... in a sense. the difference is this... this subreddit is for mental health.

&amp;#x200B;

being tired of your 9-5 job is not the same thing as depression for a traumatic event. 

being tired of your parents is not the same as depression

&amp;#x200B;

on the other hand... if you were injured at work and are scared of going to work because of PTSD-like flashbacks, that belongs here

if your parents abused you and you suffer from one of many mental health related problems, that belongs here

&amp;#x200B;

i just wanted to clarify this because this is my favorite subreddit, many people get help here that cant get it anywhere else and this subreddit must be used properly and not spammed full of whining

&amp;#x200B;

i come here talking about mental health related issues i suffer from like schizophrenia, schizoid personality disorder, PTSD, depression, generalized anxiety disorder, medications, hallucinations, ect., but i have never made a post about what ""stressed"" me out today",27May2019,0
