2,"I have the appointment tab open and all I have to do is click the ""book now"" button, but my hands are literally shaking. The only options for appointments are tomorrow or next Monday, and I have the one for tomorrow selected.

My mind is just racing. I've never talked to anyone about my mental health before. Will the doctor believe me? Will they think I'm being dramatic? Will they think it's just because of the new medication I'm on (unrelated to mental health). Will they think it isn't that bad since I never mentioned it in any of the other appointments? Will they not be able t help? Will I chicken out and not be able to discuss things properly? 

I really want to go and finally begin to address the decline in my mental health over the past few years which is impacting me a lot, but I'm so nervous and anxious about it all.

Sorry, this is basically just a vent.",13Aug2019,2

4,"Hello! im a 17 year old hailing from the USA, and i have a very odd issue ive been dealing with recently. 

I want to be insane.

Now, I dont exactly know how to explain that. Just, the idea of it is appealing to me. Reading about these episodes people go through just pulls me in. I often wonder what its like to be like that. To hear voices and see things that arent real. I have to urge to be like that. (as if its something I could just do aha) 

I did read somewhere that it leads back to an internal need to be nurtured and find love i must have been missing growing up? Could anybody confirm that? I have a sketchy past that i am willing to talk about it if someone deems needed for further analysis. 

I am not medically diagnosed with any mental illnesses, Ive never been tested for any. I have reasons to believe that I do struggle with episodes of depression ranging from an unwillingness to communicate to suicidal thoughts. I have acted on those thoughts in the past, but have gotten past them. I'm no longer suicidal as a was, just very..sad. 

Sorry if that has nothing to do with it. felt good to vent for a second there. 

back on topic. here is the big question. Does anybody know why I would wish to be in such a state? Its obviously not an ideal state to be in as a human, but nevertheless i wish to one day just be..insane.",13Aug2019,5
5,"I’m condescended to in my family because I don’t have “responsibilities.” I don’t have kids. I don’t have a job. I am a full time student trying to finish my degree and get the hell out of here. It was their choices that led them to have kids and not go to college out of high school and not get out of this town. 


It’s like they don’t want me around anymore. I’m more trouble than I’m worth. I don’t stay up when I wake up because I’m constantly waking up with headaches. My sister said today, “Let me guess, you don’t ‘feel’ good” when I told her no to running an errand for her this morning. She only ever talks to me when she wants something—watch the boys, help with her Spanish, ect.


They know I have depression. But they don’t know that I also have anxiety and PTSD from being raped by my boyfriend when I was 16. They don’t know that I have random panic attacks and write goodbye letters to them because I don’t think I can survive the night. Or that I have frequent panic attacks at night. But do I ever run to my mom’s room in tears? No. Because I don’t want them to think I’m more of a burden than I already am. It’s like they’re just waiting for me to end it already.

7,"TL;DR: Sad and scared 20something struggles with finding a new counselor for themself and their anxiety and needs someone to tell them to keep trucking 
I've struggled with depression and severe social anxiety since I was in high school. At the start of college, I started seeing an excellent counselor who showed me that I wasn't a monster and tried some meds that got me back on track
My self image took a seemingly irreparable hit from years of despising myself, and in the past few years that I've lived in a new city that I love and gotten back into school I've struggled to get my anxiety back under control. 
I panic at work, I panic at home, I panic while shopping if I so much as see my reflection. 
I was seeing a therapist 2 years ago but after several sessions I could tell her methods... weren't for me. I recently mustered up the courage to find a new one and went to one pretty good session, and she blew me off the several times that I attempted to set up a new appointment after this (I'm sure I'm not the only one, but making phone calls and reaching out for help is VERY hard for me, and these feel like rejection). 
I contacted another doctor near me and found that she isn't taking new patients at the moment, she was very kind but I can't wait for 2 months to see if I can maybe get an appointment. 
I guess it's starting to feel a little hopeless. My work is suffering, my social life is suffering, my art is suffering and I havent been so anxious since I was a teenager. I was trying to wean off of my antidepressants -because my insurance is changing and I hate relying on a prescription that can ruin my week if it doesn't get filled- but now I feel that I'll need to go back to my full dose.
Advice? Words of wisdom? I have trouble sharing these feelings with friends, many of them refuse to see therapists or don't believe that medication is a good decision, and I guess I'm looking for any sign that I should keep trying.",13Aug2019,2

I recently found a career in something I've always wanted since I was a kid, however dealing with my off mental health is making it rough, I found myself many times today wanting to burst in tears and quit because I felt it was just too much.

11,"I'm sad. All the time. It's getting worse. Some days I can't get out of bed sad. I don't know why.

I have friends who love me. I set goals and accomplish them. I workout 7x per week. I'm at a regional competition level in a certain athletic realm, which is something to be proud about. My job is good. I'm not struggling financially. I have cut out toxic people (family) in my life. I eat well. I'm good at tertiary skills, not out of natural born talent, but I worked so hard to, say, be good enough at art to sell it. I have things to fall on that are supposed to help my self esteem.

Doesn't seem to matter, the sad always wins. It's getting worse, now suicidal plans have come across my mind, and I know it's bad because I haven't told anyone. I haven't told anyone because I'm afraid if I do, I know that they would feel responsible if I go through with it. I don't want to put that feeling on anyone. I'm not immediate or immanent risk, but I can't seem to win against the depression.

12,"I’ve been having extremely suicidal thoughts for about a week. It’s terrible and mentally exhausting. Literally all I can think about all day is “should I take my own life?” I can’t sleep at night because I i can think about is “maybe I should just do it already. I could make it quick and easy.” I’ve thought about the whole process already and made a plan, I was going to write a note for my mom telling her she’s a piece of shit and it’s all her fault (which it would be) then I would go to the train tracks by my house and let it hit me. That story is all I can think about. I have a feeling if my mom disappeared from my life completely I would be the happiest man alive but that’s not going to happen. It’s literal hell even being in the same house as her and I can’t do it anymore. There are no other alternatives.",13Aug2019,2

14,"Hey everyone. Just thought I’d share my mental health story as inspiration to anyone out there who’s currently fighting. You are not alone. 

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder almost 2 years ago now, while suffering from these disorders for 3 years. It started out with mild panic attacks and that occasional empty feeling. I tried my best to ignore it and pass it off as the nerves of starting high school. Eventually, I started missing some classes, I didn’t write any of my exams in my grade 11 year, ending up in hospital from anxiety attacks on the week of my finals. I was afraid to talk to new people, I wouldn’t go out in public, I lost all my friends, I stayed in my bed and cried for days on end. My lowest point came almost a year ago. After I had failed grade 11 I felt like a complete disappointment. I felt like I didn’t fit in, like I didn’t belong in the world. There was no place for me. I dropped out of school in October, and developed several addictions (alcohol, marijuana, anxiety meds, nicotine.) I spent all my days at home, in my bed, alone. I cut off contact with everyone, I quit skateboarding, playing hockey, among other hobbies and lost my job at the local rink. I began self harming and considering suicide. My life was spiralling out of control, I felt lost. I still remember sitting down with my parents, crying and telling them that I just wanted to die. I ran away from home during a snowstorm, wearing nothing but pyjama pants and a sweater. My family found me, lips purple, fingers blue, on the verge of hypothermia in a dugout at the local baseball field. I almost died that day, and at the time, I wanted it. On December 18th, 2018, my life turned around. I was high on marijuana and anxiety medication, when I suffered a full blown mental breakdown and anxiety attack. I freaked out, crying, screaming, shaking, confessing everything to my family. I was an absolute mess. I woke up the next day and made a promise to turn myself around. I worked to stop abusing my medication and took the doses I was supposed to. I quit alcohol, marijuana and nicotine cold turkey. I’ve been sober for almost 8 months now. I began seeing doctors and therapists to help me. I slowly built a new, supportive friend group. I picked up the old hobbies I dropped and even found some new ones, I make/collect shoes and clothing now, I would love to get involved with fashion someday. I even began dating my girlfriend of 8 months, to whom I owe my life. She’s the reason I’m still alive. Just recently, I started looking for a new job too, and while I never made it back to school, I would like to work towards my high school diploma some day. I never thought I’d live to see 18, now I’m looking forward to my 19th birthday next year! It does get better my friends, trust me. Just keep fighting!

They're are many times I'm actually telling the truth. 

My older brother often ""hit"" me because he accused me of either lying or just disagreed. This infuriates me when he gets physically abusive.

17,"In high school I was very depressed and suicidal, at the end of my junior year it took everything in me to express this to my parents (old fashioned brown parents). I knew that I was getting to the point that I was going to do it, I had already written a letter and decided how I wanted too. I thought I had nothing to lose at this point anymore. I told them I felt like I weighed an extra 300lbs, that my heart dropped from my chest to my feet, that I saw the world in greyscale and I just couldn’t shake it. I told them that I wanted help. I was immediately greeted with anger. My dad lashed out at my ungratefulness of what they provided for me given that they moved to this country for me and the opportunities it brought us, that I should feel lucky for what I have and that everything wrong with this generation is that we have it too good so we create problems for ourselves. I thought, it’s such a shame, that they’d believe me if I was dead. So I told him ok, went upstairs, sat on the floor and stared at the bottle of sleeping pills. I did this everyday for a year. Some months later my brother gets into some trouble which threatened his college acceptances, he tells my mom he didn’t see a point in living. She becomes his biggest advocate,his number one supporter, his shoulder to cry on and number one support. Cut to a few weeks ago. My dad calls me on the edge of tears, explaining a problem I can’t understand, it was childish and I told him just that, he needs to suck it up. He told me later he was thinking of killing him self. I told him his problem was juvenile and  to suck it up, that could’ve been the last thing I told him. Part of me was scared, for many reasons, the toughest man alive in the eyes of any daughter is admitting he’s broken. And also because I became the worst enemy of my high school self. I’m angry, as a 16y/o I pulled myself back from the edge whilst the rest of them drove me to it, and here they are at the edge themselves.",13Aug2019,2
18,"I often think about the most philosophical questions possible, the ones that cannot be answered and they sometimes scare me. For instance, I will think about Descartes and wonder “how do I KNOW I’m not the only conscious being?”  I recognize my thought as irrational, but at the same time since I cannot PROVE the thought wrong, I become anxious. 

I also deal with some episodes of depersonalization where basically I’ll just be chilling at work and become hyper aware of my existence? Can anyone relate to that? Like I’ll just all the sudden be like “holy shit I’m actually a brain controlling a body who’s living in this world right now”.

24,"I have never told anyone in person, through talk or text, the full story that I am going to attempt to tell now. I've never had the heart, or the courage, or whatever it is, to speak on my behalf. However, lately, I feel as if it's come to a point where if anything continues to build from within, I'll do something that I never imagined myself doing. I don't want it to come to that.

I've always struggled with confidence. I've always had a head on my shoulders when it comes to booksmarts and oddly-acquited wisdom, but I never had the social skills to feel capable around groups of people. Physically, I don't think I'm bad looking, but I think I could be better if I tried. The biggest thing that gets me is my left eye. I was born with what everyone thought was a normal set of eyes. However, around the time of Kindergarden, my left eye began to turn in. It turned that it was, for lack of an overcomplicated term, lazy. I began to wear glasses to correct it, and being a child, I didn't care much. However, moving into middle school, discovering public image and girls, it started to really get to me. I didn't always see it this way, but I believe I thought that looking directly into someone's eyes was the best way to see who they really were. I felt that I was physically incapable of doing so. I can't focus on both eyes at once, it's just... not there. I began to develop a tendency to never look people in the eyes, or the face, when speaking to them. I believe this severely hampered my ability to project confidence or to allow people to take me seriously. It still sticks with me today. 

To bridge my eyes into a sort of beginning for my adventure through the mental state, some day around the time of middle school, I started to notice this little thing floating around in my vision. This thing turned into several things. Come to find out, they were floaters. I didn't know it at the time, and being the clueless kid that I was, scared to speak, I just assumed that it would pass. It never did. They stayed, my vision stayed the same, but I began to look into what it could be on the internet. A torn retina? How do they treat that? Blah blah blah... a needle... directly in the eye? My middle school self was terrified. I didn't want to go through that. For days and weeks, I would be anxious because I thought I was losing my vision but I was too scared to do anything about it. I already thought my eyes were broken, I didn't want them to be removed or something, but I didn't know any better. These floaters served as a staging for the anxiety that was to come. 

I was in the band in middle school. I played the trumpet, and I took pride in being first chair. It was always fun to boast in front of the new band kids coming in from the lower grades. It was fun, until one day, I saw this girl. Looking back, this was the first girl I had ever seen that actually took my breath away. She played trombone. I was always finding a way to look at this girl, without seeming like a weird middle school stalker, without much success. Time went by, a summer came along, and I got braces. Now, playing a trumpet with braces is just a tad painful, and little hard to get used to. I needed to switch instruments, for the band's sake and for mine, and I needed to switch to a larger mouthpiece. How about a trombone? I switched to trombone, and I got to sit by this girl, call her Jane. We became great friends, shared plenty of laughs, plenty of stories, and a number of moments. I liked her, a whole lot. Another summer comes, and band camp comes along, and there's a new girl on the dance team that I've never noticed before. She had noticed me though, and in a shocking turn of middle school events, we were dating in two weeks. Now, I still liked Jane. A lot. This became apparent, even more so when we were accused of flirting all the time in school. One day, over a Google Doc (yeah really) I found out, through the guessing game, that Jane liked me. A lot. I broke up with that other girl, and Jane and I became an item. My eyes were still bothering me. 

When we got together, everything changed. We barely talked, even in school. We were cautious, maybe even scared, of people knowing. I don't remember why. We would go days without speaking to each other. Eventually, after a couple of months, I decided that it wasn't what I thought it was, and I broke up with her. She was obviously distraught, she didn't know what she did. I had convinced myself that she didn't think a thing of me, and that's why I needed to do it. Now, Jan's was an A student. Top of her class, smart as all get out, played multiple instruments, always working on funky project. That stopped after I broke up with her. I blame myself for it. 

After Jane, high school had started, and I was in with a new girl, call her Barb. Barb liked me a whole lot, but the feeling wasn't very mutual. For myself, regrettably, my thoughts were still with Jane, as I realized after the fact.",13Aug2019,1

That after 21 years of major depressive disorder and anxiety, I’m tired of fighting within myself. 

I can’t tell anyone that. Cuz they’ll call the police or think I’m looking for attention or just not take it seriously.

I am a notoriously moody person but my lows normally never last this long (2+ weeks). I'm worried. I almost feel like something awful HAS to happen soon to humble me and make me appreciate what I have again. And that gives me anxiety.

28,"oh gosh, where do i start.. 
(i hope this isn’t a mess of a story, i’m not a good writer)
when i was 14 i had my first heartbreak, it was awful...

it messed with with my head so bad, i got depression which has honestly ruined my whole life (atleast that’s how i feel)! it got so bad they put me on Zoloft, which was supposed to help but... it made my life a living hell and worse than it was before the Zoloft.

from taking the Zoloft, it took away my depression but gave me nightmares, i was really monotone and not myself, and worst of all; it put a voice in my head. which was so so bad.. 
some nights it still haunts me like if it was real, i don’t know how to explain it.

the nightmares were not different ones, it was the same nightmare, over and over...
i was in my room laying down and i couldn’t move. i would look into the corner of my room and i saw a tall man in all black. his face was rough with no eye holes like slender man. he has a long smile though from one ear to another (use jeff the killer as reference) with sharp razor teeth, blood dripping out of his mouth. my room would catch fire &amp; i couldn’t move. i would wake up sweating and crying like if i was really in my dream. 

i was super monotone compared to my normal self, i was never the super loud happy, go lucky guy but.. the person i was was no longer there. no smiles, no emotions, or no expressions. i wasn’t “noah” anymore.

then the voice, the awful awful voice. a deep voice it was, haunting at the same time. it wouldn’t say much that i can remember, it said four main phrases though! 
“you’re good for nothing.”
“you’re worthless, no one loves you”
“c*nt c*nt c*nt c*nt....”
“burn” with a, oh so terrifying laugh.

so after that started i got an addiction to cutting myself and my parents walked in one day i was doing so. my parents then tried to get me a councilor so we could make sense of all of this chaos happening in a damn 14 year olds life!!
it took 8 months to find me a councilor and it took to long.. 

i attempted suicide for my first time at 15 because i couldn’t get help , i took a whole bunch of random pills and after i took all of the pills i started crying and started panicking because i thought, life is crap but i DO NOT want to die.. so i ran to my parents and they took me to Adena hospital and i had my stomach pumped.. 

after that i had to goto a crisis center so i could talk to someone and it helped so much, i was finally taking off of Zoloft, i was no longer hearing the voices, finally got my emotions back, finally got free of that nightmare but, i now have a permanent fear of the dark because i’m afraid the man in my dreams would be there. to this day i cannot stand the dark!

16 years old..
i finally got a real councilor to talk to! life was good other than the anxiety i have formed that took an impact in my life. 

i got a new girlfriend named let’s just say... “Sunny” ( i started dating her 2 months before i was 16) which NOW i regret. but back then, i was happy.
she was amazing! i could talk to her about everything and everything! she was so beautiful, she took my virginity, she was my first with so much things in my life. which hurt me in the end.  oh, how abusive she started to become. controlling my life, telling me i was worthless and stupid because i couldn’t pay for stuff all the time like “i was supposed to.” i dated her for a year and a half.

if you could guess, me and her broke up. it was the hardest thing i had to do.. but finally i broke off of the abuse she had on me. once again stirring up these awful awful feelings of self hate, wanting to cut, and wanting to DIE. 

there it was, my second and final attempt i did. i cut my legs so deep that i was bleeding so bad that i couldn’t get them to stop. it was terrifying and once again, i regretted it as soon as i did it, so i yelled for my mom. (which to this day i feel so bad that she had to see these awful scenes that i was doing to myself.)
after a lot of counciling and healing!
i made another stupid mistake.. 

17 years old...
i got back with Sunny in january. to this day i wonder why.. she used me for her own self pleasure, she once again ruined me once i was healing. it messed me up once again after 2 months i broke up with her because it wasn’t a good idea and i saw it. 

two months after the break up... 
i got back with the girl who originally broke my heart at 14 years old. i don’t know why i did but, i know i missed her and i feel like could be why i came back. if you can think about how that went.. you should know, it was AWFUL! she used me like how everyone does in life, i had sex with her and 3 days later, she left me. it hurt my heart so so bad. :( 

one more month goes by after that break up...
i get with my most recent ex, we can call her Liza. she has been the best thing that has ever happened to me, i don’t ever regret dating her or anything. we dated for a 13 months, well actually 12 months and 29 days to be exact. 

i don’t want to fully explain about her life and our relationship because it’s going to hurt me.. 
(unless people ask me to post our relationship stuff.) 

but long story short! she lived with me &amp; my parents. she healed me, she fixed me, she loved me, she did everything and anything for me. but... i never noticed till after she broke up
with me but.. she changed me, completely. i never saw how controlling she was !
- i wasn’t allowed watching the shows i liked
- i wasn’t allowed to dress how i wanted
- i wasn’t allowed to talk to females (even in my family)
- i wasn’t allowed to listen to my music
- i wasn’t allowed to have many friends, so i only had one. 
- i wasn’t allowed to have social media
- i has to have sex with her every night

18 years old...

well last month Liza broke up with me :) it was so cool.. just found out a few days ago actually the real reason she did. (i attempted to get closure for her but Liza refused, and still refuses to tell me to this day) but! the real reason was because she was with my only friend i had 

i found out, she started dating my best friend, AKA my only friend. so now we’re up to date..

to where i feel worthless &amp; i feel betrayed.. 
i lost trust in all my old friends because i dropped them for a girl, i lost trust of some family members for that same reason as well. 

life has been so rough since then.. my anxiety has been so high, i have lost 20 pounds. ( i was 135 when me and Liza broke up.. now i am 115)
i’m so depressed and i’m so hurt, i have no motivation for anything because all i ever do it, lay down and watch anime when i’m not working. i have been just a great ball of sadness and hurt. 

so i guess, this is my scream for help..
i have given up trying to get help on this by myself..

i’m sorry for the long story, i tried to give as much description as i could. thank you.",13Aug2019,3
29,A young family member just told me that they feel many objects around them (especially doorknobs) give off negativity directed at them. They said the objects don't have faces or personalities but had a difficult time describing it beyond that. They said they've felt this way for at least a year. They also said it's particularly bad right now which happens to be the night before a big life event. Our family will be requesting a professional opinion about this.

33,"Hi I'm a 23 yr old female (this is a throwaway account).  Sorry if this post isn't allowed here, just looking for some insight or similar experiences, not a diagnosis.

Ever since I can remember my parents have joked I have ADD.  This is mostly due to the fact I get lost during stories I tell and zone out during conversations.  When I was a kid (around 7 and then again around 10-12rs) I suffered from extreme anxiety where I often had thoughts of suicide.  When I was around 10 I pulled out so much of my hair I had bald patches all over my head and I had to wear a bandana for months.  I didn't see a doctor but my parents bought a book on childhood anxiety and learned exercises to cope with anxiety. 

Ever since then I have had different BFRBs I've dealt with including on and off pulling out hair.  I also can never sit still and have troubles relaxing or focusing. In post secondary I did well but either had to be drawing, on my phone or sleeping in class.  It was impossible to focus. When i try and relax or in I'm sitting down for lunch or in my car i constantly need to be picking at myself.  In the past year it has gotten pretty bad where I have scabs on my scalp and hairline, I pull at hang nails until they bleed, pull out my hair and chew my nails.  Otherwise I function pretty well in normal day to day other than social anxiety.  

I am just not sure if this is worth going to see a doctor or if anyone else has similar symptoms.  No matter what I've tried I cannot stop picking at myself and I feel people are starting to notice when I'm talking to them but also picking at my scalp or hangnails/cuticles.",13Aug2019,2

35,"So I’m physically in tears right now feeling like I’m about to vomit because all this time I thought I was better. I have been formerly abusive to some past partners and another person. In 2017 I swore off all abuse, quit drugs, and went to therapy and am still in therapy now doing really well, so I thought.

 I have a “friend” who I thought has been, for lack of a better term, toxic for me, and I recently acted in a way that I thought I was doing the right thing until I found this post right here: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DytmQ7lV4AIDCkz?format=jpg&amp;name=large

And I realized I was doing pretty much all of it.

This “friend” has been in an on again off again relationship with me for several years, we were never solid on whether we were a thing or not (first bullet on the post list) Over the course of knowing this person they did things such as: act generally extremely immature for attention, blatantly ignore me seemingly on purpose to go on their phone to type/giggle at roleplay chats with other people even while physically hanging out with me, is a pathological liar who has told me, among other things, that I was not allowed to go to a party with them since their ex was there and was planning to beat me up (not true, ex WAS there but had absolutely no intention to hurt me), refused to be seen within ten feet of me me at one point in public because “I looked too much like a man” (I AM a man...) and has also told me they have done things like build robots, climb mountains, swim across rivers, etc that they obviously haven’t done, and they also turn around and claim multiple disabilities which they may or may not actually have, but that would prevent them from doing all the other things they brag about (fifth bullet on this list, for me not respecting to these things they tell) they have frightened my dog by making loud noises on purpose and proceeding to do it even louder after I told them to stop. They fake-laugh and scream overly showy in public to gain attention from anyone, humiliating me in the process. I had been forgiving them and continuing to spend time and affection with them every time they did something toxic to me because I had no one else to talk to and I thought I “loved” them. (sixth bullet on this list!) the last straw was when I hosted a small gathering for my birthday two months ago and this person made it the personal show of them, where they spent the entire time telling long stories of miraculous feats they’d “accomplished” that had obviously never happened, and showing everyone anime clips that none of the others including me knew anything about or cared about. (Fourth bullet on this list, me not caring about the things they were passionate about) I think this person would fit the criteria of some of the narcissistic people on raisedbynarcissists.

So what I decided to do was cut off contact with them until they apologized, since they obviously knew what they’d done was wrong (second and third bullet on the post list) The problem is, they apparently did not. After roughly a month they finally called (yes, we were apparently best friends/more? and yet they ignored me for a month...) acting like we were still buddy-buddy, and they were very shocked when I didn’t want to talk (once again withholding affection as a punishment). They then began freaking out about “what did I do” and I had to explain, and they basically said they had no idea any of that was wrong and they will “try to let me have the spotlight instead”. 


My fucked up abuser brain thinks I was in the right and they were toxic and I did what I should have done to distance myself from them.

I’m so fucked up I can’t even fully realize what I did was wrong. And if you say what I did was okay because the other person was toxic, that’s simply not true, that’s like saying it’s okay to abuse someone just because they are flawed. It’s not okay to abuse anyone. Period.

38,"TW gun usage

Okay so I just need to know if I'm overthinking this. I tend to be impulsive in the way that I'll instantly respond to things with empty threats of or dark humor related to violence. I however have no intention of actually hurting anyone ever in fact I feel extremely guilty if I so much as verbally insult someone. Anyway my family owns a few guns and it has always been seared into our brains the golden rule to treat all guns as loaded even if they aren't. So my cousin and I had the guns out and after we both quadruple checked that none of them were loaded and mutually understood there was no danger.  I decided it would be funny to pretend to shoot him with one. Now we've often pretended to hurt each other with random objects including toy guns or things we used as toy guns however it's always been this unspoken thing to not do so with real weapons. Despite having always been strict about following gun safety rules at that moment I just kind of impulsively acted and now I am concerned about getting near weapons. I've been considering going to a counselor to discuss my problems with self esteem and impulsiveness and this kind of confirmed it for me that I should do that since I went from strict safety principles to really bad joke really fast. I have been struggling with depression and anxiety related to self hate and the fact that I make seemingly small bad decisions (like bad or offensive jokes for instance) that I obsess over because I can't stop myself from thinking it is a bigger deal than it really is. Just wondering if I am overthinking this or not please don't comment about idiotic firearm usage because I am very aware that this was stupid.",13Aug2019,1

Started in the middle of summer break were at later times in the day i'd start to contemplate everything iv done. I saw it as nothing considering we've all done that. But it kept getting worse as days went on. Soon i'd question relationships between friends or my gf and what exactly my plan for life is. I'd always compare myself to other because all my friends seem to know what they're doing, they know their dream job and are working towards it academically, with most being in AP classes. Didn't take long before it felt like I wasn't going to do anything with my life (yay! so cliche). I liked to approach things realistically  and after writing down my thoughts and reading them I brushed of the fact I didn't know what I was doing, or comparing/questioning everything. It seemed like something everyone does. So why make a big deal out of it? Time passes and now somehow suicidal thoughts crawled back and I honestly don't know how. Nothing in my life is hard, i'm honestly spoiled as a teenager, but i'm somehow feeling stressed about ""something"" and suicide becomes a valid option somehow. I didn't want to reach out to people because there is no reason why I should feel this way, I feel as if it's not justified to feel depressed almost, as many have it much worse and can find value in life, and its a repeating cycle of, feeling depressed, suicidal, realize it's not justified, tell myself to toughen up, breakdown mental, repeat but 5x worse. in till I am at the point were I just wanna sleep everyday away in till this mental ""thing"" does away. And I know that within a few weeks, or months time it will be fine again, and give it another few weeks or months, and I am going to feel like shit again. It's cycle that I caught on in 5-6th grade, and recall other periods of severe down time, one point cutting, and another putting a gun to my head and staring blankly into a mirror at myself in till I came to my senses.  And I am pretty sure my mom was bipolar, and I am assuming that's is. But I hate assuming, and I held back on talking to my gf who's diagnosed bipolar about this because I don't want to assume stuff, it would be hella rude and I don't wanna act like I am just trying to find a sick way to relate to her when it's been a concern after 7th grade.

They’d talked about how their relationship (which they’ve repeatedly said is just casual) has been an absolute emotional roller coaster and they were glad they’d be visiting family  for a while to get their head on straight about it all. I expressed (as we have done for each other for years) that I felt the relationship was causing more distress and anxiety than it was a positive experience.

with one question, every supportive, encouraging, uplifting, reaffirming statement that my friends and S.O have told me over the years are gone. the one thing that gave me comfort in social situations, that gave me a tiny bit of confidence in myself, is no longer valid to me. I can no longer believe it's true.

every single one of my flaws that I've ignored, downplayed, or tried to accept, are now constantly at the front of my mind. I see myself through the eyes of others and not the way I see myself when I look in the mirror or through a lens. 

I feel like it's just all been a lie, a rose-colored delusion. I know my friends and family love me and obviously want me to love myself, but I can't. any progress I made is gone. I'm second guessing everything. it makes me so sad that all their efforts have been wasted. there will be moments when I feel that confidence or comfort, and instantly I'm reminding myself that it's false, unreal.

I know I should be stronger and more resilient, just blow it off. I shouldn't care what others think, it should only matter how I feel. easier said than done. I feel so dumb thinking back and acting like I was something special when I really know I'm not.

59,"Hi everyone, I want to just open with the fact I know millions of others are struggling much more than me and have it much harder. It's took a lot for me to post this, and maybe it's taken me much longer in terms of time to say something, because I (perhaps fooling myself) don't believe I have any mental health problems nor have been diagnosed. Although some members of my family have struggled quite bad, I'm not totally sure how related the two are.

I've had no real trauma to speak of and generally I've always been happy and positive, full of confidence etc but as the years have gone on, and I approach 30 life just hasn't worked out how I thought/believed it would and I just seem to struggle with the monotony and everyday so much more than everyone else. I really believed I would make something of myself but it seems every time I've started something or been excited about it I fail or it just doesn't seem to work out (or I don't even try, for what reason I don't know - lack of self belief maybe). 

Anyway recently I'm doing a similar job to what I did early in life and I'm making good money and there are prospects there to make more money, be my own boss etc but the work and the long hours will always be there. I hate the hours and the work is largely uninteresting to me. I feel I need to be interested, challenged and the like. 

Anyway I've got other things going on but at the minute it feels like the professional side of my life is really weighing me down. I don't enjoy it, I feel I've let myself down and wasted my talents/potential, I struggle to get out of bed in the morning (not physically, I'm actually an early riser, it's just knowing I'm going to do another 12 hour day just to get home barely keeping my eyes open on the drive home, to shower, eat and sleep then do it all again). On top of this pretty much all my family and friends joke that I'm just lazy, with some even getting very annoyed at me that ""everyone else can do it why can't you?"" 

So really that's my key question. Why can everyone else just get on with it, with jobs and to some degree lives, that they are bored with or find no interest or enjoyment in. It seems like everyone else, despite how much they complain about what they do, just has this ability to get on with it and I can't. In the back of my head I've always had this thing of if you're not happy change something, you only get one life why spend the majority of it miserable etc but obviously I know you have to go out sometimes and do things you don't want to so you can provide. I just don't want to be miserable in what I do, and it really affects my home life and relationships too when I'm spending 12 hour days doing this work. This, coupled with trying to figure out what I want to do and constantly having a ton of ""life admin"" to do (dealing with agencies, going in and out the bank, filling in applications, sorting insurance, those kind of things), family life etc means I'm just getting so bogged down I'm not eating, I'm having anger and frustration issues, I find myself crying for no reason, headaches and my body is physically aching. It just feels like I'm a ticking time bomb at the moment and the most minor thing can set me off. I just want it all to stop. 

I have to add to that that I'm not suicidal at all. I could never do that to the people I love. I just wish sometimes they knew how I felt and would try and support me rather than make me feel guilty for how I feel. As I said I would never end my life, I just wish I could pause it sometimes. Or go away for a while and come back with a clearer head, or start from scratch I dunno. Starting over seems easier than untangling this mess. 

Anyway I am sorry I had no idea this post would go on to be so long. It feels like all of this has just fell out of me. I'm not sure if anything I think or feel comes under anxiety or depression or just everyday stress, all I know that inside my head right now isn't a very pretty place and I need to do something about it because it's affecting everything I do.

I'm 22f and live with my boyfriend who could not better and my best friend is over right now asleep in the living room and all I can think about is hurting myself. I haven't self harmed in over a year and not severally since I was 16. But it's just pushing on my brain how much I want to die and how much I know it's never going to change. I'm not going to hurt myself most likely but fuck I don't understand why I feel this way. I hate being so sick. When stuff like this happens I feel like it's just a cycle and no matter what happens it comes back to this awful place. And that'd how it must be. Of course part of me says that's not true and the other part is completely convinced I'm going to die by killing myself eventually. I don't believe this but it feels so intense and I do get help. I see a psychiatrist once a month and a therapist every two weeks and I feel like I'm really trying and there's a point where it's just out of my control and it's terrifying. Thanks for listening to me rant random reader. I felt like I had to get it out somewhere. I don't feel like I can wake up my boyfriend or friend at this hour. They're perfect and beyond supportive but I have a hard time bringing stuff up like this without voices telling me anyone I tell will get hurt. Oh what fun. Anyway, thank you. I want things to be different tommorow.",13Aug2019,7

65,"Does anyone have any advice or recommended resources on how to cope with anxiety and OCD at work?

I have a really hard time with forgiving myself after making mistakes, and in my job I have to be extremely careful and accurate. Basically, it revolves around numbers, and fairly often the numbers are handed to and interpreted by the media. Which means that I sometimes have to answer calls and questions from the press. 

I'm noticing that this is in conflict with my social anxiety and OCD tendencies. I worry a lot about whether everything is correct, wanting to double check everything several times. I also get very anxious about handling journalists who are looking for a headline, since I'm so scared of anything being wrong and bringing bad public attention to the firm I work at by failing to understand or communicate something. 

I've only been working here for a few months, and I know have to power through it and get to the other side of this. I can be very good at this job if I don't let my issues get the best of me. But I'm struggling with the process of getting there. 

Any advice would be most appreciated.",13Aug2019,1

We weren't married so I have no legal rights and she knows I cant come up with the $1000+ dollars to for an attorney. I have no family or friends that can help. My son is my best friend and best thing to happen to me. Shes told me outright shes doing this to hurt me, but she fails to understand how this can effect my son.

67,"So, I have wondered if anyone else feels this or of I'm just fucking crazy

I often feel like a bug is crawling on me or biting me, but when I look for the bug there's usually nothing there. My ears, nose, and scalp sometimes crawl and feel like there are bugs in them or under them. I usually have a hand in my hair to feel around my scalp for bugs that I know are not there. 

When I was about 14, I picked at the back of my neck because I was convinced that there was a bug burrowing in my skin. About two weeks later, my mom found a huge scab about an inch big at the back of my neck, under my hair, from me picking at it. 

It's also noteworthy that I often hear people talk about me or laugh at me behind my back and I wonder if it's because they notice me messing with my scalp or fidgeting from the bug-skin feeling. I get a lot of weird looks and I avoid going out in public these days because people will watch me. 

can anyone else see or feel this bug-skin thing?",13Aug2019,3
68,"Does anyone else have issues with chaotic choices? A councilor I was seeing said it seemed my mind ""has been wired to seek out chaos"" and it could explain why even when i spend tons of time and energy trying to mske the right decision it can and usually does inevitably end in something that blows up in my face because apparently my mind gets off on the idea of chaos around me instead of peace and it sees peace as total chaos. It has become a real problem. It goes way beyond self destructive behavior at this point and is destroying my life. I cant focus on anything that used to make me happy and every time i seem to find some semblance of peace, the moment i start to relax, things just going wrong and i can backtrack them to something i chose that i thought was a gold idea at the time.",13Aug2019,1

He does snore alot, even sometimes while he's awake which bothers me alot. However in the past few weeks ive found myself quite litterally screaming ""Ah!"" and leaving the room as fast as I can, I get very angry and overwhelmed. Recently my stress levels have risen alot, which is when I first started noticing this, I cant even have tea with my friend because of she slurps her tea. Im scared itll get worse and ill push everyone away, I avoid being around people eating and drinking just so I dont hear them make these noises.

71,"I(45m) was bullied for a few years in grade school by a few different groups- a mixed age group from my immediate neighborhood and a like-aged group from across town, my classmates. This wasn't taunting, this was being physically punched by multiple people most days. I was in the hospital for concussion once. My parents talked with teachers and principals but no change ever happened until I changed schools. That was decades ago. Late 70's early 80's. I don't think about it at all anymore. But I think it formed my permanent world-view, my thoughts on authority's intentions/effectiveness and my opinion on what human nature is. 

When I walk around, everyone I see or talk to, I am certain they have the capacity to turn cruel and vicious for as little reason as that they have nothing better to do. There's no compassion or empathy keeping people civil, its just a system of consequences and punishment that keeps people from stabbing each other. Okay that's a bit of an exaggeration, but only a bit. THIS piss poor view of humanity is what I'm preoccupied by most of the time. Feeling like I'm treading carefully through a world of monsters. I often attribute this view to different things, but this is probably where it all started, and now its just how it feels like the world is.

74,"My boyfriend is a trauma victim and has struggled heavily with depression for a few years now but when the incident that caused his trauma happened, it made his depression spiral out of control. He’s been going to therapy, is on meds and has switched them for not working about 4 times. He forgot to take them yesterday and got in a really bad headspace and ended up having a really bad depression episode. 

I’ve seen him have them time to time but this one was different, I knew something serious was up from the way he was acting, then he said “I sometimes wish I had no family, that I had never met you and that it was just me on my own, I wouldn’t feel guilty if I tried to KMS then” and it broke my heart, I’ve never been in a situation like this. He kept making comments like that and saying he wasn’t sure if he would hurt himself or not, saying it was his fault I was crying and that he just wanted to stop existing. I tried to reassure him of how much we all cared and how much he mattered and meant to everyone. I managed to talk him into taking some melatonin to try and get to sleep (he usually does this when he starts to have a bad episode so that it doesn’t get out of hand) which worked and I stayed up all night making sure he slept and that I woke up and he was still in bed beside me. 

I messaged his best friend who’s the only person aside from me and family who knows what his depression can get like and he didn’t reply to me until this morning, but please if anyone knows of anything I could do to help in a situation like this if it arrives again, please please let me know.

76,"I love my husband more than anything, but lately I am disappointing him and it’s really hurting me. TLDR: looking for techniques to put on a happy face for my spouse or to make him feel more appreciated and less exhausted by me.

My mental health has been quite bad lately. I’m trying to find providers to see but have been running into lots of waitlists. At this rate, I’m not sure that I’ll be seen before October or November.

My spouse is generally supportive but this has been wearing on him. I’m down in the dumps, cry at the drop of a hat, and lately ruminate nonstop. I’m miserable, to be honest. I “fake it” at work but by the time I’m home, I’m exhausted so it’s much harder to put on a fake smile at home.

But my spouse misses me being normal (I get that, I do too). Lately, if I’m quiet or sad, he’ll just look at me and sigh then tell me to stop being a pessimist and look on the bright side. Last night he told me that he’s stressed with work too but he can come home from work and be normal, so why can’t I?

I want to preserve our relationship, so I promised to him that going forward I will either put on a happy face or basically hide in our guest room and stay away from him if I can’t fake it. But sometimes when I’m at my absolutely lowest, being near him keeps me above water. I’m worried the isolation will make me worse. 

Any common experiences? Any coping mechanisms? I’m using CBT and journaling apps but constant nonstop ruminating is making life really unpleasant right now. I’d love to get in with a therapist and psychiatrist tomorrow, but so far I can’t find a practice who can see me before 6-8 weeks.",13Aug2019,2
77,"I have a long history with mental illness, but I was never formally diagnosed. I’ve been told by two psychiatrists that I have bipolar tendencies, but it was never certain. I’ve experienced many depressive episodes throughout teenage years, even now. I also have a history of suicide attempt and I’ve self-harmed by cutting my wrist with sharp objects. 

I’ve been battling with a toxic relationship and it has been making me an emotional wreck. After a huge fight two days ago, I blocked him because I couldn’t stand the idea of communicating with constant fights. Ever since that, I’ve been so overwhelmed with sadness and it has caused me to have anxiety everyday. I would proceed my day as usual, but my heart would race like a horse unexpectedly. My palms and feet are cold and sweaty. I have difficulty breathing, don’t have an appetite for food, I also cannot concentrate at work but I have to present next week, so it doesn’t help. I feel so depressed and I even began having thoughts of deaths. I imagined myself cutting again and to relief the pain I am experiencing mentally.

I recently began my psychotherapy session (it’s been two weeks), but I don’t think medication would be prescribed there (I live in Germany).

I was in treatment for 5 years-basically my whole teenage life. I just recently started at a regular high school but I am finding it really hard to adjust back to life at home.

I could go into detail about why I feel the way I feel and why I hate my life and why my life is terrible, but I'll spare you the details. I am an incredibly hateful person. Everything bothers me. I cannot stand stupidity, nearly every opinion I disagree with gets on my nerves, I despise my family because they're all complete and utter morons (once again, I don't want to get into detail but you'll have to take my word and believe I'm not one of those people my age that love to overexaggerate how bad their problems are) and my whole life really isn't going my way at all right now. The last time I was happy was November to December of 2017 - I had just gotten into a relationship which pulled me out of a major depressive episode that had been going on months prior, and that miraculously made me feel incredible, just that one relationship I got into completely changed my perspective on life. It then ended in January after we decided to meet for the first time (it was long distance) and my anxiety decided to give me a major panic attack to then get completely ghosted after it. So yeah, that's nice but anyway my point is I've reverted to my old way of thinking and I don't know how to change my perspective; I don't know how to be happy.

81,"Hi everyone,

I just set up a reddit account specifically for making this post, because I am unsure of who else to vent about, as it's quite a shameful problem for me and don't feel comfortable discussing it even with friends and family. I even feel guilty writing this in case people I know come across it and find out who I am.

I'm a 22 year old female from Ireland who is currently in college doing my masters. Although I have a wonderful life which I'm incredibly grateful for, I have always been very anxious and have had my fair share of mental health issues. There is one issue though that has hung over me for practically my whole life that I hope you can help me with.

I have an older brother who has autism. He's two and a half years older than me and was diagnosed when I was a few months old. It was really hard for my parents, especially my mam, and growing up I always knew he was different from the other kids in my school and our neighbourhood. But I love him so much and would do anything for him, and I often feel guilty that he won't have the same kind of life or opportunities as me. But we do do our best for him; we all used to go on holidays together when I was younger, and we bring him for days out in town doing fun activities every now and then, just so he's not stuck in the house all the time.

Now, I know what I'm about to say will piss off a lot of people, but please, stay with me. He was diagnosed at around the mid-90s, when the whole MMR vaccine-causes-autism scare was going around, and so my parents suspected that the MMR caused my brother's autism.

I personally don't buy the whole 'vaccines cause autism' thing - I feel like autism is so complex and people who have it have so many different qualities and traits. For instance, my brother is very particular about things - he wakes up at the exact same time every day, and has all his meals at the exact same time, and keeps his routine religiously. He's also really obsessed with cars and knows nearly every car model out there. And I just think to myself 'how the fuck does a vaccine cause all of that?'

Anyway, this scare about vaccines/autism has taken a serious toll on my mental health. My parents didn't have me or my younger brother vaccinated after my older bro was diagnosed because of the pain they experienced when he got the diagnosis. I know autism is absolutely not the worst thing in the world to be diagnosed with - some of the greatest and most forward-thinking people in the world have it! - but I feel like the emotional and mental pain my parents experienced at around that time definitely passed on to me.

I will say, please don't assume my parents are bad people because of they actions they took after the diagnosis. I know there's a lot of anger towards anti-vax people, which is totally understandable, but my parents aren't the kind of people who would believe dumb conspiracy theories or believe everything they see. And that's mainly what causes me so much upset; they've done so much for me and my siblings and everyone who knows them says that they're lovely people. They raised us to be kind and caring to others and be grateful for what we have. But this whole vaccines/autism thing just really leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Whenever I try and talk to them about it it just ends up bringing back all those painful memories they've experienced of bringing my brother to see doctor after doctor, therapist after therapist, not to mention the nasty words they've gotten sometimes.

The reason why I'm posting this is because I want to change. I grew up scared of vaccines and don't want people to think that me or my family are terrible people. I've cried so many tears over this and have self-harmed in the past as well. I've never been suicidal or have attempted to take my own life over this but it just gets so dark and overwhelming in my head sometimes. I'm scared of what my brain is capable of making me do, and I don't ever every want to reach that point of thinking everyone would be better off if I was gone. If I have kids some day I am going to immunise them and don't ever want them to grow up scared of vaccines like I was. I only decided to post this today because I was diagnosed with mumps at the doctors this morning and nearly broke down when they asked me if I'd ever gotten the MMR. I was mortified telling them 'no'. They were really nice about it and didn't get angry at me, but it still brought up all those awful feelings and memories again.

I have a great life, great friends, a loving family, and have had amazing opportunities. I do a lot of creative work and am hoping to be a writer some day. Overall I'm a really happy and bubbly person but this issue has given me so much grief and I just want it to stop.

Sorry for the very long post, and please no abusive/hateful comments. I've experienced so much mental and emotional turmoil because of this and don't need anymore.

Any words of advise or just nice words of support would be enormously appreciated.

82,"Honestly, I'm really frustrated and need a little rant. 

My father's side has a very long history of Bipolar Disorder and I have some very obvious symptoms. 

*I forget to eat and drink (dehydration is a REAL issue for me)
* I rarely wash, not due to lack of free time, I just don't really register that I need to. 
* I have serious money issues. I overspend and it has led to some relationship breaking issues. 
* I go through manic periods where I clean until I'm over exhausted and become bed bound. 
*Sleeping is either I fall asleep every 20 minutes or I won't sleep at all (depending on what mood cycle I'm in). 
*I get irritable over the slightest things. I can be fine and then I'm like demon spawn and I'm not sure why. I'm not able to rationalize my response. 
*Concentration is non existent during my depressive periods. I have immense difficulty concentrating on Facebook messages let alone a TV show or book. 
*I can get pretty talkative with people when I'm hyper. I've told strangers my entire life story and then come away from the conversation and been confused why I just told them all of it. Also, I can speak for an hour straight when I'm over stressed. My partner gets really frustrated. 


So, based on those symptoms, I thought I had a pretty strong case for at least being assessed for Bipolar by the NHS. My GP said she suspected it too and that it was essential I got help as I have a toddler (2yo boy). I 100% agree as I want to be the best parent.
However, I went for a mental health assessment today. And from that assessment I know that I won't get help. The woman labelled me as simply 'depressed'. Due to waiting lists, those who haven't been given a more specific diagnosis are told that there's no point going on the list for help as it's a 3-year wait. 
I feel like my symptoms have been overlooked as I share the symptoms as my father who was diagnosed as Bipolar Type 2 in his 40's. Like, the exact same. 

Am I being unreasonable? I've suffered from intense depressive lows and most of the above symptoms since I was 10. I spent my youth in areas where mental health clinics for children were unheard of, and when I was old enough for adult clinics either my referrals were 'lost' or appointments were cancelled. 

I'm just frustrated as I'm trying to get help for my mental health so I can be a better parent.",13Aug2019,1
83,"I was in year 8, I became paranoid and started having irrational thoughts. I would have constant panic attacks where I felt like I couldn’t breathe. This was before Christmas, so when Christmas came, I cried the whole day while my mum tried to comfort me. She has arthritis so had to have a rest in the afternoon, where I continued to cry while watching TV to clear my panic and make me forget about my worries. When I came back to school, I would have panic attacks in my lessons and my grades dropped. My mum eventually pulled me from school to send me to a mental health clinic. I had to go every few days as I was in terrible condition. I was diagnosed with psychosis, I didn’t know what it was at the time (I was 12 years old) but it scared me. I was also diagnosed with anxiety. They put me on multiple medications after my condition worsened, I would have panic attacks when being given a new medication as I thought I would be allergic to it. My weight plummeted as I was scared to drink or eat anything in fear of choking or becoming allergic to it. I was already pretty thin due to genetics, so I looked deathly thin. After blood test results for my medication, I was found to have a vitamin D deficiency. I was diagnosed with OCD after refusing to touch any surfaces and obsessively washing my hands every five minutes. I was hospitalised after not eating for a while. The hospital didn’t care for my condition and would ignore me whenever I had a panic attack and my twin had to go to school and my mum had to go to work, so I wouldn’t see my family until the afternoon. It was my second day there and a family member of another patient told me to shut up when I was panicking, so the nurse just threw me in another room. I eventually was discharged and put down as an outpatient. I eventually got better but had to be arranged for school, so it took a while for me to go back to school, and was given time out passes. My classmates started bombarding me with questions of why I was off for so long and I would take half days in school to get back into the routine.

89,I'm officially diagnosed with a whole ensemble of mental illnesses and some part of me is immensely scared to actually get better.

I guess I'm a bit confused because I've always read/heard from different sources that you don't actually NEED a reason to see a therapist, but it's good for anyone to go if they can afford to. Hopefully that makes sense.

Anyway, I have not been making any progress with my therapist so far. I am also on medication and nothing is working. My therapist says I have untreatable depression. Is this a thing? Is the getting better in 6-8 appointments a thing? Should I just look for a new therapist?

In this scenario, once they reply, i calm down a lot.

93,"Hi all! I finally started seeing a therapist about 2 months ago. I've been about 4 times so far. At the first appointment, she told me that normally it takes 6-8 appointments for patients to get better and that if I am not better by that time, I should start seeking other help.

I guess I'm a bit confused because I've always read/heard from different sources that you don't actually NEED a reason to see a therapist, but it's good for anyone to go if they can afford to. Hopefully that makes sense.

Anyway, I have not been making any progress with my therapist so far. I am also on medication and nothing is working. My therapist says I have untreatable depression. Is this a thing? Is the getting better in 6-8 appointments a thing? Should I just look for a new therapist?

Thank you!",13Aug2019,3
94,"First case - One person said Friendships are temporary. He's a 50+ guy, who added that friends come and go. He's only concerned with how friends add value to his life. Friends might return. it's up to his mood and state of mind.

Second case - Another said that friends will always be friends. His idea is that there can be one day suddenly no more contact or communication, probably by way of his strange view that there is an unspoken understanding that the moment a friend contacts you they want something (often sinister) or there is an emergency. He thinks normal friends who go on separate routes should not keep in contact or meet up.

Third case - Another has no concept of lasting friendship. Her friends come and go on a more frequent basis than the first case. She believes in affinity. Once affinity between 2 people are up, there are NO longer friends. It terminates.

So what do you think of these? Are they wrong? Are they right? Does it depend on the personality of these 3 people? Or are the ideas of the concept of friendship bonds universal?",13Aug2019,1

98,"I’ve been seeing quite a few posts about people having trouble getting and/or keeping a job. So, I thought I’d share a resource that I’ve recently discovered. It’s called Clubhouse International, and it’s a non-profit organization. It’s a network of local community centers around the world that provide (non-medical) services for people living with a diagnosed mental illness. Membership is free, and being a member entitles you to help finding employment, education, and housing, as well as wellness programs and social opportunities. To find a clubhouse near you, click [here](https://clubhouse-intl.org/what-we-do/international-directory/).

Each clubhouse offers 3 types of employment assistance. Transitional Employment is part time and temporary, usually 6-9 months in length. No formal interview is required, and the clubhouse staff maintains a relationship with the employer, allowing them to provide onsite training, support, and coverage during member absence. Supported 
Employment can be part or full time, and isn’t time limited. An interview may be required, and while the clubhouse doesn’t provide absence coverage, they can still assist with training and support. Independent Employment is usually secured by the member, and support is provided offsite, if needed. They can also help with job applications, resumes/cover letters, and interview preparation.

For those who may not be ready to work yet, the clubhouse is run side by side with staff and members. This is called the “Work-Ordered Day”, and it’s totally voluntary. Members can stop by whenever they want, whether it’s for a few minutes, a few hours, or the whole day. There are different units, all essential to keeping the clubhouse running, and tasks include greeting visitors, preparing lunch, cleaning, data entry, etc. It’s a great way to learn new skills, gain confidence, and feel like a productive member of society.

Anyway, I hope that this post helps someone out there. I’ve only been a member for less than a month, but I wish I had known that a place like this existed years ago. Once you find a clubhouse near you, just print out a referral form, and have it completed by a medical professional who is familiar with your mental health history. Cheers!",13Aug2019,1
99,"The thing about having mental health problems and issues is that people around you also get tired. 
Tired of asking how you are. Tired of inviting you to events. Tired of saying “it’ll be okay” “you can do this”. Tired of waiting for you to be okay. 

I wish I could be okay as soon as they ask me how I was, am I okay. 
But I can’t. I can’t even explain to them all the thoughts going on in my head, all the pain I feel. 

As much as I want them to stay, I can’t make them. Because they get tired. And I don’t want to drag anyone else into my mess.

My mother goes to the grocery store once every two weeks, and buy enough food to get us through two days. For awhile, I was going to the supermarket with my father, who bought enough food to get me through one week. But my mother found out, and put an end to it, claiming the food was unhealthy. I typically am eating one meal a day at this point, which is dinner. I usually am not able to finish my food at dinner, as I personally find the recipes unappealing. I’ve even offered to cook myself, but my parents will not buy the ingredients. My mother will only buy healthy foods. Her shopping list consists of berries, nuts, and plain yogurt. I’m trying to put on weight, as I’m only around 105 lbs, but doing so is difficult on this diet. (Im 5’9). I’m 100% open to other choices of meals, and (unfortunately) just stopped my vegetarian diet, as I was not getting enough nutrients to maintain this diet. Either way, having your choices of meals being dictated by others, and going days without eating is terrible. This is especially frustrating, as my mother only cooks the meals she sees fit. Occasionally my father will pick up snacks for us to eat, but that is only once in a great while. I think getting a job is the best idea at this point, although I wanted to improve my mental health before doing so. (My parents refuse to buy me medication to help improve my anxiety or depression.)

106,"This probably isn't the right place to go for this but I seriously couldn't think of anywhere else, so here goes:

I just really want to find someone who can relate to or explain my experiences. Basically, I am constantly counting things. Like, for example, while I'm writing this post, if I make a typo and have to delete a letter, I have to press backspace exactly five or a multiple of five times, and if I don't do that straight away, the moment I remember I can't help sorting it out. It's not like I get anxious or particularly stressed, I just can't physically stop myself. (Most of the stress comes from wondering what's wrong with me.)

In addition, I'm constantly adding up numbers, looking for ones that add up to the number 25, feeling mildly uncomfortable when I see the letter 7, and never doing 2 of something in case I do 5 of something else and it adds up to 7. I have to do everything with both hands and I have really specific rituals that don't provide any peace of mind or stress me out but I also cannot help doing.

My mother has similar experiences that were particularly bad when she was a teen - I am a teen right now but, unlike her, I've dealt with this since I was little - but faded away once she got older. There is family history of synesthesia, though I don't have it, and I've previously been to a therapist for stress and prolonged low mood (though these were unrelated to what I'm describing here).

If anybody has any clue what I'm going through (and I'm pretty sure it's not OCD as there's no anxiety aspect to it), I would be eternally grateful for your input. I just want to work out what' going on and how I can deal with the irritation it causes me.

Thanks so much,

109,"I just got done with a summer transition to college program. About two weeks in, I found myself seriously contemplating suicide. One bout was caused by an academic failure and one was caused by intense gender dysphoria (I’m a trans woman).

I have a long history with suicidal thoughts but it’s been a long time since I’ve seriously contemplated suicide. The first suicidal thoughts I can remember were in 4th grade and they were surprisingly serious, even to the point of having a serious plan and time frame in mind. Since then I’ve dealt with suicidal ideation at various times in my life, but it never felt like a problem until now.

I’ve consistently checked myself for depression for the past four years and I really don’t think I’m depressed.

111,"I've been on here a short amount of time, but feel I can share my experiences with others. I hope to connect with others who have followed similar paths as well. Just to be clear I was diagnosed and treated for Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia (the latter after voluntarily being committed into a psychiatric unit). 

I must have been 19-20 when I stopped taking my medication and going to therapy (outpatient treatment after being discharged from the psychiatric unit). When I stopped taking my medication I was unable to sleep for almost a week (I was completely wake for 6 days), I was hallucinating and extremely violent up until I finally fell asleep on day 7. After that I just had withdrawal symptoms for 1-2 months (and violent outbursts that started to happen less and less after 1 year). It's been almost 10 years that I've been medication free and have not received treatment and counting. So why am I telling you this? 

* I went through a string of psychiatrists (and therapists) that believed I would never get off medication or refused any input from me about negative reactions to the medications I was prescribed (ex: I was on one particular medication that had me sleeping 18 hours a day, I could not stay awake and felt absolutely nothing, the dosage was high too and I was barely able to do simple tasks like feed myself). 
* I was and still am completely aware about how irrational I can get and either have no control over it or can rein it in about 80% of the time. Often times my therapists refused to believe I could do this or insulted me by telling me that I was being delusional about having or learning to control myself. 
* I believed without a doubt that I could treat myself (by treat I mean live in peace with it, not cure it like others believe they can do by getting treated) and I did. I stopped taking my medication and I stopped going to my clinic, I did this knowing that something could go wrong and I might not be able to handle the withdrawal. 
* I also did it because I had absolutely no support from my family, they thought I was being dramatic or doing it for attention because my sister is also diagnosed and in treatment (hers is a strange case, she started seeing a specialist by the time she was 10, has been in and out of hospitals up until she was maybe 23-24 and if she doesn't take her medication for more than 3 days she'll lose her sh\*t and her withdrawals take a physical toll on her body). I felt like I was already a burden to them and to myself, so I made the choice of no longer being that. 
* I used to self harm, had a drinking problem and had overdosed so many times that I almost died on several occasions. 
* I honestly just wanted to see if I could do it, I had no back up plan if it blew in my face and I'd be in a deeper hole than I was at the start. 

I've lived with depression from the time I was 5 up until now, there's no moment in my life where there was no depression, it's always been either mild enough that I can still get things done or high enough where I couldn't do anything. These days it stays on mild, I do have high levels of depression but on those occasions I'm able to get out of work by taking time off to take care of it. I'm at a constant battle with my depression, if I try to do ""A""  it will tell me: *you can't do it, you only ever do things half-way, you're worthless, this is why no one can stand you, what do you gain from this? you're never going to do it, give up now it's easier, there's no point in doing it, who cares if you do it? we'll do it later.*

Then there are moments when I get violent or think violently: *I'm hurt so now I have to hurt them, break and arm and break a leg, stab them, beat them with a hammer, break all their fingers, cut their tongue, slit their throat etc.* I'll be like ""woah, where did that come from? no, we're not doing that, we don't solve problems like that, take that shit back to 0 and think for a minute. It's one thing to think it and another to do it, the most violent I've ever gotten was breaking property or injuring someone by giving them a concussion or almost breaking their arm (I was 14, I've learned from those experiences). The only time I do get violent and will act on it is if people disrespect my personal space and feel entitled to touch me in any way, I refuse to interact physically and those who know me know to ask first or wait for me to initiate it. 

I feel like I need to have as much control over my emotions as I do with everything else in my life. I organize everything: my home, my finances, my job, my day to day needs. Everything has ""order"" even when it's clearly a mess, I know it, you know it, so leave it where it is. I've had meltdowns from someone cleaning my room or ""organizing"" my papers, even after I fixed it the violation of it being done stays with me; a normal person wouldn't react like that I would think.

The voices didn't stop talking until 4 years after no treatment, they do pop up on occasion but I block them out or ignore them (makes me sound crazy even to me). I do get upset or become so emotionally drained that I just take a break from everything and everyone, I don't keep people around that don't understand or haven't accepted the way I am, I prefer no one question why I've been gone a whole month after I come back ""refreshed"". If I was in any danger, I would have reached out. 

I want to help others out there, I sit down and listen to friends and family when they're going through something, I take everything they tell me and give them a rational explanation, a logical decision. Sometimes we don't want to make decisions we know we must, sometimes we need to hear our answers from someone else. I don't let my disorders define me, nothing is impossible because everything has a solution, the only solution you can't find for is after you've died. I'd like to say something cheesy like ""I woke up one day with this realization"" but that would be a lie. I looked around me, saw that I wasn't getting better, realized I didn't want to admit to myself what outcome I wanted from all this and decided I would start making my own choices, with or without anyone's support. Instead of complaining that I ""carry the burdens of my family over my shoulders"" I thank them, because I know I can manage the weight and I know that despite all the bumps, I can get it done. Even when I have bad days, bad weeks, bad months where I feel like I can't move forward, that I'd rather go back to where I was comfortable, I push myself to get up and keep moving because no one will do it for me. 

It's strange sometimes though, living with disorders is like having two people on your shoulders, knowing they're there and they impact your life, but then you keep going despite the fact. It's kinda hard to explain it sometimes, people around me feel like I have it together or that I have a cold mind (not sure how it would be said in English, it means that someone can stay calm in situations that would normally cause others to act recklessly or become distressed) when I don't. Sometimes when others are in bad shape, those things in me really quiet down and I find the strength to reason with them, whether I get them to do it or not. I could be having a crying spell and I think for hours about all the sacrifices my grandfather made (he's no longer with us) and I get angry at myself for falling, for making myself believe that I could stay deep in that hole knowing I could get out.

To end things, I just want to say that I chose to remain untreated and live my life simply through will and I know that I'll sometimes fall and remain there for periods of time but I will get back up, I'll go back to where I left off. I had no support (still don't), I did it for myself (when I used to not care about my life) and when I see other people trying to follow the same path, I tell them the path is long and might never end, the path might feel impossible and you might have obstacles for a while or for a long time, the path might not be the right one for you and the path has consequences. It ""doesn't get better"", throw that sh\*t in the trash because it's not true; it becomes ""bearable"", ""livable"", ""manageable"", take your pick.",13Aug2019,1
112,"For context, I’m a sophomore in New York City. I’m ace and also a furry. I’ve told only one person about my asexuality and I’ve told nobody I know (I’ve got second social media’s and stuff) about me being a furry. Not even my family. Living in the city means I get limited freedom in terms of distance from my family. I can’t really travel around without my mother and father wanting to know where I’m going and why which means that I’ve kept a very secretive profile when it comes to family and even friends. Having started high school only last year I don’t want to tell any friend about myself worrying that their perception of me will change or that they will tell others and they will look at me in a worse way. 

For the last month or so I’ve been on vacation in Long Island with my mom and sister, only issue is my sister is constantly harassing me verbally and occasionally physically. It’s nothing serious but the terms of our relationship has really left a dent in my mental state. On top of this my sister is younger and isn’t as capable with chores as me. This means that with my mom telling me do stuff constantly, my sister harassing me, and no way to travel alone (it’s the country side and I can’t drive), I’ve fallen back into a depressed state.

I can picture my happiness, the issue with it is that it usually contains me living alone either in college or past that in some other state far away from my family. This idea is nothing short of a dream though, it’ll be years until some situation like this occurs and my mom and dad say I need to go to college somewhere close (like within a 3-4 hour drive). 

How do I tie myself over until I can achieve this goal? How do I improve my mental in this situation? How do I deal with hate from being a furry and an asexual?

113,"(I live in Ontario, Canada)

Apologies for any disorganized/confusing post structure, and long post. I've gone back and forth through the post many times so I might accidentally cut off somewhere in an incomplete thought, and if I do, please let me know so I can fix it. That's how my brain is dealing with this right now lol but my main goal here is to get out what I'm thinking, so if you have any further questions, please ask. Will TLDR at end of post but I feel like details are important.

So, to give some background information, I'm currently diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, and ADHD. I have no addiction issues, am strictly straight edge (no drinking/smoking/weed/drugs) to keep myself as mentally healthy as possible, and do not struggle with potentially addictive medication.

I'm currently on Vyvanse 40mg (not taken regularly), Bupropion 300mg, Prozac 20mg(?), Clonazepam (0.5mg per pill, taken as needed, infrequently, sometimes 2mg to sleep), Quetiapine 100mg (at night occasionally for sleep, helps my insomnia by keeping me asleep but usually for 12h straight which has cons and pros lol), and Lorazepam 1mg (for emergency anxiety situations/when clonazepam isn't doing its job). Typically (if I remember) in the morning I'll take my prozac, bupropion, vyvanse, and clonazepam (one pill although my prescription is 2 pills twice a day; I prefer to take as needed so my tolerance doesn't rise too much).

I've asked my doctor (and at times, when I needed to see them, emergency doctors/a psychologist (or psychiatrist? I don't know, she had the ability to alter/prescribe medications though) about many different possibilities. I don't *want* more illnesses or something that could be perceived as ""worse"" than what I'm already dealing with. I don't want the illnesses I already have, so there's no situation of wanting to. But what I'm worried about is that something could be misdiagnosed, or that something more is going on. I've felt this way for a while just because idk. Something feels wrong, it feels like ""it can't just be this"".

Now, like I said in the title, I wonder if I experience mania to some degree.

I'm wondering this because I'll go through periods (of indeterminate length) where I feel extreme elevated levels of happiness in certain moments (perhaps when momentarily everything in my life feels okay). This often leads to me making long-winded posts online. But within those short periods, dread starts to creep in, and I often end up spiralling immediately into yet another sense of dread and misery. That feeling then becomes almost inescapable and I have to try to find some way to distract myself.

It just happened now (I haven't quite reached the dread yet but took clonazepam to try to offset that/prevent it entirely). I was up on top of the moon suddenly, blabbing away, when I could feel that inkling of ""bad"" trying to creep in. I only realized now because I was like ah man, I think this is a pattern (it happened last week). Whenever I talk positively about the good, especially if I go on and on, it sinks down Very quickly into bad.

Could this be mania? Like I said I don't usually know the timeline of this kind of stuff, how long it lasts for me etc. The only thing I can think of that lasted a particular period of time was when I met a cherished celebrity I look up to a lot (this was a couple of month ago, I saw him again after meeting him 8 years previously as a weird shaky teenager) and had an AMAZING experience. It was the night of my dreams. I was on an obsessive high about the situation for almost a week, and then crashed SUPER hard, to the point of feeling physically ill, but I just attributed that to ""too much of a good thing is a bad thing"".

I want to know that my illnesses are still accurate and that I'm receiving the proper treatment (that I can afford; I'm in Canada and have medical coverage through both OHIP+ and ODSP, but cannot afford therapy).

TLDR: Diagnosed with MDD, GAD, SAD, ADHD. No addiction issues or substance use outside of prescriptions. Meds listed above in third paragraph. I experience periods of near extreme euphoria at moments (in which I become VERY talkative/post a lot) that very quickly crash into depressive episodes, crushing anxiety, deep sadness and hopelessness. Timeline of this feeling is unknown, I haven't noted when/how long it happens (but I should). Sometimes these period last longer but I'm unsure on how long/how frequently. Could this be mania to some degree? Is mania common with any of what I'm diagnosed with, or should I investigate this further with my doctor? I can't afford therapy but have access to medication, and am on waitlists for cost-reduced counselling and OHIP covered therapy, with no time in sight. I did a few sessions of counselling at CAMH but I don't know how much it helped exactly because I compartmentalize and it ended up being very tip-of-the-iceberg stuff (which sadly, we only realized on the last session). 

TIA for your help. My ultimate goal in life is to live as well as I can with my illnesses - which I've come to accept most likely won't go away, but can be managed kinda through medication + effort + situational change (such as working less because of disability support) - but I want to make sure I'm treating the right things in the right ways. Blah.

I hope everyone reading this is doing well. Please give me your honest opinion (and any resources you may have that could help me lol) because if this *isn't* a form of mania, I'll be glad. But I will need a way to manage those moments when they come up hahaha.",13Aug2019,1

Not an excuse but he was good at hiding it, he didn’t live at home and we were also raising a young son on the Autism spectrum and a daughter while both working full time so he was struggling and we weren’t aware.He was diagnosed with testicular cancer about 12 years ago and that’s how the opioids started. He began to shop doctors and went to hospitals seeking drugs. He has ongoing nerve pain from the surgery and is currently talking medical marijuana. 

He married and has a son, she split when the baby was one year old, due to her own drug issues. My son and grandson lived with me and my husband for three months or so, leaving to stay at an extended stay hotel because we weren’t getting along because of the drinking. My son  then left to visit the mom in another state, left his son with his mom and went to seek treatment in Florida. my grandson’s mom drove my grandson back to us and my grandson then lived with us for four months. My son got out of rehab and found a good job in New York. When my son came back he rented a townhouse and lived with my grandson and my sons girlfriend at the time. During all of this my son was diagnosed as bipolar and more recently diagnosed with schizo-affective disorder.

Sorry this is so long! Fast forward to today: son and grandson are living in a townhouse we bought and he has been “renting” from us for the last five years (the last rent check was almost a year ago and stopped when he lost his good paying IT job). He’s working part time at a Holiday gas station now and can’t really afford the monthly association fees, heating and water bills plus food.

During this time my son overdosed on opioids and almost died. My grandson found his dad breathing but unresponsive we called 911 and went together to be with our grandson. Needless to say, my grandson has behavioral issues at school and at home.

I just had a conversation with my son over an issue with his son and it went off the rails with him ending up crying and feeling bad. He takes offense so easily and holds a grudge forever. Maybe it’s just his personality. He doesn’t take ownership of his behavior and asked why he should apologize to others when they don’t apologize to him for slights. I know I could have handled this differently and wish I knew what to do. He’s so sad and lonely.",13Aug2019,1
117,"23/M. Today I was visiting my family Doctor for some minor physiological issues. I was planning on telling her that I needed psychiatric attention, because in my country you need a family doctor to suggest you for psychiatrists, that insurance covers the costs. She made the physiological examinations and found some minor issues. She's asked me during the exams why I was shaking all the time. From then on I just found excuses as to why. She asked me why I was nervous and I knew the answer but I couldn't tell her. I left without telling her why I was trembling. Now I'm too scared to go back and tell her why. Can anyone suggest me how to deal with this? I finally made the progress to admit I need help. But I've failed on the last step. Now I feel even worse.",13Aug2019,2

119,"I have some strange mental issues, so i guess I'll explain everything here since i can't go to Therapy. 
I watched a ton of porn when i was younger, I'd stay up all night watching it, then middle school came around and i ended up masturbating for the first time, i felt great but then depression followed shortly after, i didn't tell my parents for months what happened, i barely ate, and i cried a lot, after about 6 or 8 months, i figured i better tell my parents, even though they're pretty strick Christians, i ended up opening to my dad and he told me i was evil for looking at it and masturbating and that the devil was inside me, i never went to therapy, shortly after, i started developing strange anxieties, every strange thought that popped into my head caused me much distress, i would think about strange things like colors and the concept of them i guess just really bothered me a lot, i then thought about being in a big doll house, and everyone had puppet string's attached to them, i couldn't stop thinking about these things and it got worse and worse, i would hyperventilate and get extremely dizzy, still, my parents refused to take me to therapy, also, every time i looked at anything remotely sexual i would get depressed and cry, so everything bothered me, everyday was torment, i wanted to die, my paparents finally took me to the doctor after a year and i went to therapy, though, i never told them anything due to my dad telling me I'd get locked up, so i was put on generic anxiety medicine, which didn't seem to ever help much, i still would occasionally have breakdowns and just feel like dieing.

I'm 23 now, living in the united states, Oregon, isolated on a mountain, living in the south with my dad, and i have gotten more control over these issue's, i consider therapy all the time still, because some issues still remain, for example, i have difficulties reading, my brain focuses intensely on the words when i read so i end up going slow, but then i feel like i need to loosen up and read more freely i guess? So i try that sometimes and it helps, but then that sometimes triggers me to have thoughts i can't control, like there's a second voice in my head that won't stop talking and giving me anxiety.

I also had a intense fear of being gay when i was younger dealing with this, and to this day, it still kind of remains, i say kind of, because it doesn't bother me as much, but is still a issue, if i look at a guy on a picture or something for too long, i get all tense, my hands get sweaty and i get anxious, so i need to look away.

I can't sit up anymore or eat foods i like without worrying about getting a increased heart rate and bad head throbbing (feels like my brain is being pushed against my skull) 

The back problem is very bad, my back has been tense ever since this issue started, so sitting up  becomes such a pain, i just lay down all day now watching Anime and ordering figures and games off Amazon with the money i get from my dad (games give me some anxiety so its difficult even trying to play them sometimes, even though i enjoy them)

I have a porn addiction again, i managed to quit for a long time when i thought it was evil, but now I've had a change of heart thanks to close friends, but porn still bothers me alot for some reason? I still get kinda depressed, and my entire body tenses up for days after i masturbate.

I'm on some new medicine, buspirone 10mg, it helps to a extent with calming me and making me feel like i have some control, but everyone has been telling me this is a placebo effect do to 10mg not being enough, especially since i take it once every night before bed (instructed by doctor due to the intense dizzy feelings i get from it) 

But yea, now that I'm older, life feels difficult, I'm kinda scared, my parents are divorced now, i live with my jesus obsessed father, and i don't know what to do, my social skills are so bad that i have troubles connecting with people these days, i have a few good online friends, but they know nothing about my issues, they only know i have ""anxiety"" and struggle with it.

There's things i want to do with my life, i want to enjoy things more but i feel like i have no feelings anymore, i have to make myself feel things if i want any sort of feeling, i want to sit up for hours and game like other people do, i want to draw, i want to go to college, i want to get a good job (had one once but quit, manager was a ass) but i can't, everything is so damn difficult for me.

So please, this is my LAST chance to reach out to anyone about this, if anyone has any idea what the hell I'm dealing with, please let me know, i feel like I'm insane, i shouldn't have all these strange feelings in my head, i know its NOT normal, I don't want to die, but i don't want to live like this anymore either.",13Aug2019,1

I (f/19) have been in and out of psych wards for about a year now because of various reasons( severe trauma,suicidal tendencies and a few attempts, borderline-personalitydisorder, depression, selfharm, and social anxiety) and lately I've been missing the time there. the therapy didnt help me much and I didn't like the time there,but still I feel like it's the only safe place in the world for me. If I can't be there, I shouldn't live at all and that thought really scares me and it's pushing me more and more. that's all thats on mind lately, go back or run away and kill myself. it's getting too much.

126,"Let me elaborate on this a bit more: if you’ve had a problem that you’ve overcome and you want to share it to give advice or show this person that they’re not alone, that’s perfectly fine. However, it does NOT give you the right to go “Oh yeah, my life sucks too. Did I ever tell you about the time that I....”. If you need to talk about your problems, that moment is not the time. You should be trying to give that person the support they deserve. Saying “hey I’ve got problems too” does not help anyone. 

I don’t really see this problem in this sub particularly but I do online and real life quite often.

131,"For a few years now, I've had periods of severe anxiety and the mild anxiety, as well as periods of extreme depression and just feeling like nothing. It used to be very uncommon, but now it's definitely a very prevalent part of my life. It's not all the time, it's hardly even half of the time but I still feel it, and when it happens its just the worst thing ever. But im torn. 

If it isn't most of the time then it doesnt always impact me, so do I really need to talk to someone or would I just be wasting their time? And, if I do go, do i go during one of these periods or when I feel great? I've been advised by a number of people who have... surface level knowledge of my anxiety that I should see a GP straight away, but if I'm not feeling like that at the time then is it really... necessary? To go? 

I was planning on going down tomorrow to my doctors surgery to book an appointment but because I feel absolutely fine for now I kept thinking that I'm not going to be able to convey how I feel. Theres also the part of my mind that goes - it isn't all the time, this is probably just teenagerisms and hormones and all that crap 

And so if it is just hormones, is seeing someone necessary?

132,"Hey folks, new guy here,

I hope this is the right sub to post this stuff.

Here it goes;

I had broken up with a girl with whom we just dated for like 2 weeks, then out of the blue she said she was in love with her ex bf and bla bla. She got back to him. It was new enough that I didn't care so much but it did bug me a bit. So, I decided to help this girl, one of my best friends' roommate, with her project that was due the next day. At some point, she just said, should we have sex? I was surprised, both at the proposal and how quickly I said ""okay"". Anyway, so the girl is nice and all and we get along. I never liked her physically so much but it was okay, she implied that the thing was casual anyway. Everything was fine until she called me and said she had herpes but taking her meds so it shouldn't be transmissible, no lesions and stuff. I still did not enjoy the news at all and went straight to get tested. 

&amp;#x200B;

She specifically said she did not have any diseases and lied about the type of herpes she's got, so my doctor got suspicious and ordered a battery of tests for most STDs, including HIV and lots of other things. My results were due to be up on Saturday but she called me on Thursday to say that I am HIV-positive. This news... Told no one about it, lied to my friends for a while but it broke me from the inside. Fears and weird shit of which I wasn't even remotely aware surfaced. Normally, I am known to be resolute and confident but this shit is weird. I got called up on Saturday to tell me my results came and I got confused. Long story short, they said they mixed up the results on the website, sorry, bla bla, you don't have HIV. I was happy, everything was fine, didn't even have herpes. Well, everything should have been fine at least... Even though I know I don't have it, I got this big fear of just not existing anymore, not being able to have children and just a lot of weird shit that comes with it remains. It's been 3 weeks now, still there, son of a bitch. I'm not dying of misery perhaps but I guess I wrote this just to see if this was weird enough that I was the only one. Not knowing what I need is new to me.

Today someone who trained me and I've always had friendly chats with for a couple of years complained about something I was doing to the boss. It wasn't even a proper mistake and the boss just forwarded me the email. I asked the complainer to just tell me next time so I could correct myself.

And i kinda dulled down a lot of the stuff I said because it was my first time having an assessment and I was scared of course.

I go back for my next appointment in two weeks.

It’s what I think I need (after maybe, a holiday. but that’s just as less likely to happen) but.. my relationship with my parents, who I live with is really bad. They don’t think anything’s wrong with me, don’t know I’ve started getting help. And they got super angry when I was like 13 and they found out I was self harming and suicidal from my school, so i’ve learned to keep it away from them. It’s what works best.

I have been dating this chick for about 2 months and she has shown me her biggest weakness.  It is her drinking.  She knows she needs rehab, is willing to go, but is afraid cause her primary(poly relationship) has told her to wait.  

If you have dealt with addicts(I am a former one, hence the strength to keep up and help her...too many times I have pulled myself out that pit)  you know they can change their mind on the drop of a hat.

Its killing me cause she is so over whelmed with anxiety she is returning to behaviors she had with her abusive ex in seeking reassurance and needing permission to do anything.

Mind you I have my own issues.  And before you go off on me and say that only a healthy person can help a broken one, I understand this concept, but also I have learned that sometimes a broken person is the only one who can understand another broken person.

She is so ready for help.  She is tired of the shakes, she is tired of needing to drink, and she is upset with herself cause she turns emotionally manipulative cause of her past trauma when she gets black out drunk.

I k ow it is not healthy for me, but I can read the desperation on her.  She has been screaming tor years for help ans no one listened.  I heard it, but almost too late.  I feel so bad and hurt cause I didnt hear the calls.  I didnt see the signs.  

But I can do this, even if it tears me down and I have to just drag myself by an arm, I will do it.  Cause I never had anyone and it was the worst, coming off addiction and having no support.

When she is sober she is the greatest.  And I hope I can do this.  Someone please give me hope...cause I know I dont have anymore.  I am at home taking a break.  36 hours straight is hard...and I still have prolly another 24-48 before the worst of the stress is over.  At least I know a time frame.  At least I know it will end.  

I just, I want someone to hear me like I heard her.  She kinda hears my plea's for help, but the drinking gets in her way and stops her from helping me more.  

Someone please tell me that this is all not for naught...someone tell me I am doing right, cause lord knows i dont...i feel like collapsing into a heap and just crying till i am passed out.  I see the hurt in her eyes, I hear it on her voice.  I see how tired she is, and as much as she wants to quit she drinks enough to the point that she cant quit at home and needs rehab.

I am tired...but this old soldier has put his broken armor back together, grabbed my pited and rusty sword, and my gouged and and chipped shield and hold the line once more.  The guardian of broken souls and broken addicts rises to the call once more.  His back bends with pain, his head heavy with lack of sleep, but alas he knows he has to continue so he takes a deep breath and stands tall, a thousand yard stare facing down the road and leading the charge.",13Aug2019,1

Sometimes my heart pounds fast and I lose my breath. I don’t think it’s anxiety or panic attacks because I am not sad or panicked, I just feel “off”.

149,"Excuse me if this has been posted before, I honestly could just use someone to listen. 

I struggle with depression and anxiety with a history of disordered eating. I’m not doing well lately. I’ve had thoughts of suicide and self harm  for the past few weeks and while I have a great support system in my friends/family, I need to see a professional. I’ve spent hours on the phone and online with my insurance company and countless offices leaving feeling defeated each time. Don’t get me wrong, I am so grateful to have a home, a job that offers healthcare, and family/friends but I can’t get past how expensive it is to be seen by a professional. I do what I can to support myself and realistically each session starting around $200 bucks is insane to me. Insurance doesn’t cover the specialty providers and CareCredit is also not supported. It’s just just daunting knowing I’m going to have to save each dime to set aside to get mental health help when I feel like I’m barely hanging on. Hearing “sorry we have a waitlist 90 days out” and “we don’t accept most insurances” just leaves you with a yucky feeling you know?

I work for a healthcare company and I see so many each day that don’t receive their medication because they simply can not afford it. High copays or simply the procedure/medication isn’t covered. It’s so disheartening. Anywho, thanks for reading a complete stranger bitch to the internet. I’m thankful for this community and do not mean to complain, just could use some kind words so I don’t lose complete hope.",13Aug2019,1

The last few months ive been gettibg more and more anxious, and for some reason I feel like my dad is a big part in this. When hes having a good day hes fine, a pretty normal person. But whenever hes frustrated he likes to swear, yell and hit things. Its gotten to the point where whenever hes doing anything even closely related to work I feel extremely anxious and hide in my room, blocking all sound so I dont hear him become frustrated. Just today, my sisters son was staying the day and he started crying, so instead of my daf resolving the issue normally he slammed his hand on the coffee table like a toddler and yelled at him to stop. Hes 2 by the way, the child he was yelling at. Then I told him to calm down, because theres no way that yelling at an upset child would do anything and he said something along the lines of, ""mind your own business"". I felt like I was in a fight or flight mode and I told him to just shut up, because honestly Im just sick of him acting like a 2 year old. Then he yelled, ""Excuse me?"" and tried to follow he down the hall. My mom stopped him, but Im pretty sure he would have hurt me. Im 17 and I don't know what to do about his behaviour because its really destroying my sanity, but I dont want to set him off. I really dont know what to do.

153,"I've never truly managed to live alone... Successfully. I suffer from depression, anxiety and potentially some other mental health issues (asd assessment coming up soon) but that still doesn't cover everything I have issues with.

Anyway, I moved to university at 18, after about 2 weeks my friends were feeding me and making sure I look after myself since I was doing a terrible job alone. That's when my to-be partner came along. She made sure I ate and looked after myself the most out of all my friends and we soon started dating.

It's been going really well and I'd say it's pretty healthy. I have massive seperation issues, I struggle a lot more with my mental health when she goes away from more than a few hours. I either usually go along to most places or I go somewhere else and hang out with some other people (still really difficult). She may be moving away to contimue her studies in a different city and I'm really worried.

Another thing I struggle with is... Hanging out with other people, I really wish I didn't get so upset. I don't really have many friends locally and no one really invites me places (in their defence, I don't really invite people anywhere either) so in a way it really hurts when she goes and hangs out with people without me.

It's kinda hard because as much as I tell her that I really shouldn't mind and she's free to do whatever she pleases and I'm not her responsibility or anything, it's clear that I'm still incredibly upset.",13Aug2019,1
154,"I wont give too much or go on in this post,but basically I knew out relationship had got rough,I'm currently going through custody issues with my son and it's all been really stressful on us both. 
We started to neglect each other as of course my mind was elsewhere with different things. I have bpd,ptsd as well as depression and anxiety,now I'm 30 I feel I've managed the self harming (barely exists anymore) but when the melt downs are bad they're bad. First 8 months with this man was perfect,I let my walls down and he made promises to me that he would never hurt or abandon me,he would be disgusted in exs behaviour,we adored each other. 
Things got more and more stressful with our personal lives bit we always told each other if we stuck together it would all be okay. 

With my mental health I've never harmed anyone,I've always taken it out on myself and never others,but one thing thats happened since the breakdown of a real bad emotionally abusive relationship over 2 years ago,I've started throwing things,now this doesn't happen untill it's full on,backed into a corner and breaking point,I need to really be pushed and pushed for it to happen. 
Unfortunately that happened on a night where my partner and myself had a difficult night,we weren't communicating and I was having a pretty bad bpd day. He vanished for a drive and I worried,he then came back near 10pm (uk) and I was in bed pretty much ready to sleep and he told me his parents were here. I politely declined to see them due to well,I was in bed and it was late and I was getting my kids the next morning. He also knows my mental health hates unexpected guests and visitors,it sets off my anxiety.
He walks off then the next knock on my bedroom door was his step mum. She tries and tries to get me to open the door and at this point I start to even feel stupid that I can't just open it,but my anxiety is off the scale at this point,it gets more nasty at the door,she blames me for causing this situation,my partner comes in and at this point it's me in the corner of the room him at the side and his step mum and I feel so helpless and i start screaming for them to get out...they just stare at me...for ages and i lost it. I threw a lamp that caught his MacBook and I was absolutely mortified. I collapsed in a heap and felt disgusted but at this point him and his parents are packing up his things and leaving. I begged him to stay,not for a relationship bit not to leave me this way and he still walked. 
He hates me,he left me with nothing to provide for my children,so I've had to turn to sex work again,something he spent a year telling me I was too good for and I should finally turn my back on it and build a life. He knew I would go back if he left me with nothing yet still laughed at me when he had asked. 
His parents hate me when I did so much for them and their son,hs did alot for me we changed each other for the better and now because he dragged them over they saw me at my worst. 
I sent apologies,he came and got the rest of his things from my flat that i had let him move into and he was just nasty. 


Yeh.
He had spent a year loving me,learning about my bpd and yet how he thought all of that was okay I don't know. 
I have my faults I'm not innocent,but I'm heartbroken that the man I loved has left me and not only that,in this way. 
It's been 2 weeks now,since he walked out. I miss him,I do but maybe he really didn't know me or love me after all?",13Aug2019,3
155,"With all the mass shootings lately I feel awkward. So many people keep saying ""Mentally ill people don't hurt others! That's just stigma!"" And I'm just here feeling like I'm some kind of monster lol because as a result of my mental illness, yes, I want to hurt people. And yes, I have expressed this to mental health professionals, who look at me like I'm joking. In my default state I don't want to hurt anyone but if I'm really angry or lose control or hell even suicidal then suddenly I'm not so concerned about my impact on other people, and it scares me and makes me ashamed. The neurotypicals don't like me and neither does my own community apparently, instead of acknowledging that mental illness *can make some people violent*, it's just easier to say we're not mentally ill, we're just monsters.

Now I'm not saying all mass shooters are mentally ill or suggesting anything political. I'm pretty much just venting and hoping I'm not alone. I'm starting to feel really alone and I've been more suicidal lately and all this talk hasn't helped. I'm not a mentally ill person that can be treated, I'm just a monster that can snap at any time. That's the message I'm getting.

157,"Strange, but (I think) true.

Hear me out: I have developed some type of social phobia in certain situations at work (conference calls and meetings mainly) where I get super nervous to introduce myself as well as speak and chime in.

This manifests itself into feelings of fight or flight (panic). The drug Propranolol is a godsend and is incredibly helpful to me.

That said, it’s probably also the thing stopping me from truly getting *better*. If I always resort to the drug to stop these feelings, then I’m giving the anxiety power and not truly exposing myself to get used to the feelings enough so that they eventually subside.

I’m perpetuating a potentially never ending cycle and it’s so damn hard to stop due to the fact that my actual livelihood is on the line.

158,"This feeling of disorganization and 'falling behind' keeps creeping up on me like an itch. I often make to do lists and day plans to cope when I feel this way, but I've been so sapped of energy today that I'm finding it difficult to even stay awake. A little bit of tidying up isn't enough. I feel like the world is slowly burying me in dirt and brushing some of it off my face won't make me clean.

My symptoms have always been all over the place, never quite fitting neatly into one box or another. The labels don't really matter to me, but if it helps I think my most recent diagnosis is schizotypal personality disorder, maybe also bipolar? I'm unmedicated right now but my illness has never been too consistently debilitating.

I was hoping to hear suggestions from people who have experienced the same thing and found ways to cope, or anyone who might want to throw their two cents in anyway.

160,"This text is probably going to be messy and all over the place because English isn’t my native language. For about 3 years I’ve had social anxiety, possibly some sort of bipolar and I not a single friend other than my family. I’ve tried improving my life multiple times but it never worked. Usually I think I’ve figured out what it is I need I get extremely energized and optimistic but after a while I just realized it doesn’t work. Now I don’t believe there’s anything more to try or at least that’s worth trying. When I became depressed last time I tried deluding myself into thinking everything is actually great and I’m going to fix every problem in the world by spreading www.thevenusproject.com . I was so scared to face the thought that there might just not be any purpose to anything that I convinced myself I’m going to solve every problem in the world. I wrote for hours in iPhone notes about how we need to make it illegal to lie and build robots that create the means of production and give it out to all humans equally. Back in my head I knew it was crazy but I just told myself that was my anxiety and not the real me trying to stop me. I knew even then that there was no purpose of living in today’s world but I tried tricking myself into ignoring that by telling myself all problems could be solved. But they obviously can’t. Humans are the gods of their own universe. They’re the ones that directly and indirectly cause everything that happens in the world but despite that they’ve created 2 world wars, poverty and a culture that judges people based on tribally rather than objective facts. How the fuck would it be possible to make a species like that unite behind all working to achieve something like the Venus Project? It isn’t. Life is always going to be the constant torture where everything everyone does indirectly leads to death. The one small thing I can do about it is donating all my money to charity and then killing myself. 

I get that my family will be sad when I go but that just doesn’t matter because nothing matters. Even if every problem in the world was solved so what? That would just mean humanity no longer has anything to strive towards. That would just make things even worse than it already is. I can’t say this is a fact because then I’d be banned for promoting suicide but I’m completely convinced everyone knows that everything is pointless and everyone should just kill themselves but they’re just scared to face it. I mean just ask yourself what the point of anything is. You can’t answer that. It’s like a broken car. It has all the things in it, all aligned perfectly but it never goes anywhere. Maybe we will eventually figure out a meaning to life, but definitely not in any of our lifetimes. So what’s the point then? If there is a life after death why don’t just kill ourself now instead of painfully waiting for decades for an answer we know we won’t see? And if there is no afterlife then at least that’s better than this torture.",13Aug2019,2
161,"I’ve had a long history with OCD, and lately I’ve been keeping it at a fairly low-level (it has never truly gone away from me but I can manage it). Lately I have forgotten the natural way to read somehow - for instance, when reading do you look at the first letter? Or do you look around about the second or third and let your peripheral vision analyse the first letter? I found myself asking that one day for some reason, and now I don’t know where to look at while reading - whenever I look at the first letter I find it hard to take in the full word because my brain focuses on that letter and skims past the rest, forcing me to read the word again and try to comprehend all the letters. This process takes some time, and if I mess up once, it happens again shortly after. Then I forget what I read in the sentence before and have to go back, then I might mess that up and read that again. Sometimes I accidentally skip words - but still comprehend them because my eyes still just about read it while they move - my OCD gets me to re-read them, because it says unwanted things will happen related to the subject matter will occur - for instance I was reading about directing and writing your own films (something I’m interested in pursuing), and messed up quite a few times. I ended up reading this one paragraph and the lines before it a lot of times, and now that I’ve stopped myself from reading it, my OCD is just stressing me out. I’ve comprehended the information, just messily read and going back and forth between fighting it and just reading, and going back and reading stuff again. I don’t know how I can get back on track - I don’t want to go back to therapy for this one thing, and feel if I get some support or something I may be able to break the loops of reading and just realise that none of the things it says can happen, and that I don’t have to worry about my future being affected because of some article I didn’t read correctly in OCD’s eyes, even after many attempts in trying. I am very aware of how OCD works and that it is a cognitive disorder, but for some reason this still stresses me out. I came here because it makes me feel better talking about what’s happening and spelling it out so I can see that it is OCD and that it cannot affect anything about my life because of this.

162,"Trigger warnings: self harm, sexual assault

I know that reddit isn’t the place for proper diagnosis or counselling however I need some sort of comfort that I’m not completely crazy and the feelings I have and my behaviour are somewhat valid. 

Basically I’ve been struggling for many years as what I can only describe as an incredibly intense impulses. Whether these impulses are merely emotional, academic, creative or social, it seems as though I have a horrible talent of running into things like a headless chicken. I find these impulses to be especially present in relationships, however, and I find myself becoming easily infatuated with people, obsessing over them, then ruining any sort of chance I have at a trustworthy relationship with them. My relationships are often situated around sex, either a lack of or an intense presence of it, and I feel as though many people view me as a sexualised person. Although, it’s somewhat odd as I struggled after being raped and sexually assaulted by a boyfriend as a young teenager- something that seemingly sparked all of these problems. When these relationships break down at my own doing I immaturely over defend myself and fly off the handle to the point where I feel not only like my partner’s enemy but my own. And yet I can’t not destroy everything and dig myself into the ground. 

When a partner has done something wrong, however, I quickly succumb to whatever negative thing they say about me and feel incredibly embarrassed due to my emotions just in case they thought my response was “crazy”. 

I thought that I had gotten over my more violent tendencies toward myself but recently I’ve been thinking more and more about suicide and desiring to go back to self harm. I feel strong enough right now to avoid it but sometimes I get frightened that I won’t be able to control myself like I can’t my anger sometimes.

To add to these quite horrific thoughts I often convince myself that something awful is going to happen to me, particularly when I’m trying to sleep, resulting in awful insomnia, anxiety and incessant routine in terms of checking the corners of my room and under my bed. Everything is overblown and unnecessary. 

I’m completely fed up of going through such uncontrollable mood swings and discarding people, ideas and interests to try to satisfy my impossible needs. I’m also fed up of feeling scared of myself and the world all the time, and people viewing me as some immature little girl because I can’t properly handle my emotions. I’m 18 and I’m still acting much like a frightened child.",13Aug2019,4
163,"I am sick as fuck of feeling so empty. It comes in waves, I’ll feel great for a week or two, and then I feel like someone is constantly just standing on my chest for a week, and then it goes away. I can never pinpoint exactly what my problem is, my girlfriend asks me what’s wrong and the only explanation is “I’m having a bad day”. I’ve never been suicidal, I’ve had intrusive thoughts as long as I can remember, but who doesn’t? I distance myself from everyone and build a wall around myself for periods of time with no good explanation as to why I’m doing it. 

I’ve been a terrible friend for the last year, mainly because I feel like I have nobody to talk to. I don’t want to go out, I don’t want to see anyone. I want to come home from work, and just stare at the wall in silence. My girlfriend really does try her hardest to help me, or to talk through these depressive episodes with me, but there’s no words to describe why I’m feeling the way I’m feeling. One person can only take so much, and it’s ridiculously unfair for me to put her into this position. She’s not my caretaker, I’m a grown man. She’s a grown woman, she doesn’t need this along with her own problems on her shoulders.

I’ve had the hardest time just coming to grips with who I’m turning into. It’s easy enough to put on a front at work, act fine, go through the motions and go home. But when I get home, that’s the end of it. I can rarely keep it together. I’ve always been the type of guy who doesn’t need any support, I’ve never needed someone to push me to reach any sort of potential. I’ve been carefree for as long as I can remember, up until this past year. I have no desire to push myself at work, I’m having a hard time getting up in the morning anymore. I haven’t been to the gym in months.

I’m working on myself every day. It doesn’t seem like much, it’s probably not even noticeable to anyone else. But I know that at the end of the day I’m still hanging in there, and I guess that’s what matters most.",13Aug2019,4
