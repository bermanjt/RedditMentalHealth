I asked her if it was true that even for people who stopped the Lamictal, there acne never goes away and she said it is possible that may be the case, only time will tell.  I hate, hate myself right now, I hate looking at myself and washing my body and it makes me cry almost every day. I wish I would have never taken it knowing this could possible be irreversible.

4,"Even though I'm still 16, in total I've worked at 4 different jobs, including the one family business. I've notice there's always the same trend for each of these places: I would start off adequate,great even, but slowly as the mistakes pile up,the anxiety overtakes me, and my performance deteriorate. 

I would over analyzing instructions to the point where I don't follow my instincts, which otherwise would allow me to do the tasks correctly. This is partly why I'm settling for the job I have right now, because each shift is 3 hours total, 2 days of the week and the work is objectively easy. I chose this job, specifically so I won't get stressed out like I did before,like that one time I was so stressed out about working the next day at this other place, I started hyperventilating and couldn't sleep. Downside is the pay is not good. If I feel like I'm failing at a job like this, how can I find another one?

So far I've been alright, but the these last 2 weeks, I notice the cycle is back. I'm anxious, slow on my feet, and not retaining information. It started off with just me learning normally, then I was a bit slow, and now I'm failing. My instructors are becoming frustrated. It's starting to freak me out because I don't wanna end up dreading to go to work or quitting due to anxiety. It makes me feel even shittier, because any teen can get this job. It's a tutoring center for little kids for christ sakes, and I shouldn't be stressing out like this;it should be easy. I could try just sucking it up, but that's just me hiding my anxiety while I continue to be faulter.

I've always been a bit slow though, but I don't if that's causing my anxiety or vise versa. I just want to perform well and not be like this when I do find a better job or when I go live on my own. I feel like a scared child, and I'm not prepared for the real world even though I'm about to be a senior soon.",06Jun2019,1

7,"Psychiatrist dropped me off all my meds cold turkey

So I moved last month, I'm still on the waiting list for mental health services 

I've been off all of my medication for days (gabapentin, vyvanse, fluoxentine) and I just got a voicemail today saying my old perscriber isn't comfortable prescribing long distance and I have no idea what to do. The pharmacy filled a request yesterday morning and they haven't got a response. I have a strong feeling they're going to have me wait till i get in with services. 

This is the first time I've ever been off any of them since I've been perscribed. Is there anything at all I can do??? Everyone is saying to go to the hospital but I've done that before and they weren't able to perscribe

To make things even more confusing I was told by the front desk at my old place that they were having issues sending scripts through, but that she sent them, but that was yesterday. According to the pharmacy there's been no response to the requests

I'm willing to go into the hospital if it'll bear results but the last time I did that I got stuck in a locked unit for a couple days which made me feel even worse. Really unsure what to do and everyone I could possibly ask for help irl is already throwing their arms up and getting on my case for asking

* 

That was earlier. I've since called crisis and they said to go to the hospital to make sure it's not something else but I know for a fact it's withdrawal. My anxiety is getting worse to the point where nothing makes any sense, im having hot flashes and i feel completely sick, I'm pale and I'm shaking. I have literally no way oc getting to the hospital and this isn't something I can just power through",06Jun2019,1
9,"Hey all, my uncle has struggled with some form or another of mental illness his whole life. My great grandfather was a diagnosed schizophrenic, and my uncle had many of the same struggles and fears but was never diagnosed. About 5 years ago he lost his cld and could no longer work as a truck driver. He wasn’t great with people so he went from job to job. Most of my family had a hard time recognizing this as part of his illness until he got sick about two years ago with a horrible lung infection due to his living conditions. From then on my dad (oldest of the 6 ) and my aunt (2nd oldest) realized the help that he needed they tried to get him in therapy, counseling, jobs or anything that could lead to success. Nothing ever seemed to work they paid for his living expenses as a way to help out. Well today my dad realized he hadn’t heard from him about rent so he went to check and found his baby brother dead. Just devastating. My goal from now on is to raise awareness for all types of mental health. At a loss on how to go about this and make a difference, does anyone have any suggestions ?",06Jun2019,1

Recently I’ve been doing fairly well mentally, as far as emotions and moods go. I recently ended a fairly traumatic relationship, if that matters at all. For some reason, I live with persistent thoughts that everyone around me is not as they seem or malicious in some way. I guess it could be slight paranoia, but for example I’ll be talking to someone in normal conversation and my mind will be telling me they have evil intentions or are taking what I’m saying to use against me in some way, or that people around me are talking in some type of insulting way towards me without me knowing. To the point to where I don’t go around friends much anymore or anyone besides family because within minutes of talking to them I start to panic thinking they have bad motives or are against me in some way I’m not sure of.

23,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

It's hard for me to even organize my thoughts here. I feel utterly lost and ""alone"". Alone in the sense that, yes, I have very few friends. But more so, I feel alone in the way my mind works. Reddit is a majority male platform. Specifically, a majority male/gamer/white/educated platform. I am the opposite in every way besides educated (I am almost finished with my degree). I carry a certain amount of shame that I use this website as my main source of ""social media"". I'm ashamed I rely on it for help with my mental struggles. Can't say I've ever met another female that uses it to the degree I do. Shouldn't girls have a group? A group of solid women to rely on? I feel completely left out of that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, I know I struggle anxiety, depression, and some other unnamed...thing. It's hard to say what that thing is. I know that a switch clicked in my brain around 7th grade. I went from a carefree, energetic young kid to an absolute shell of a person. I started acting out, getting bad grades, and in high school, I began experimenting with drugs/sneaking out/boys etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mood has been in the absolute toilet since middle school. I get spikes of happiness, but am generally anxious, sad, and irritable. Oh god it doesn't take much for me to snap, but I've been working on it. In the last couple of years, the most pervasive mental health issue for me has been the inability to interact socially. **I am CONSTANTLY analyzing other people for the slightest hint of judgement**. Do they think I'm a phony? Mean? Socially awkward? Weird? The decline in my social and romantic life would prove that yes, they are thinking that. I care a lot because I want to connect, I want to be likable, I want to feel included. I never had problems attracting guys or friends until a couple years ago. I am now a complete recluse.

&amp;#x200B;

I worry constantly that I'm in the prodrome of schizophrenia. That something is literally about to burst. I've even convinced myself I have: borderline personality disorder, Asperger's, schizotypal disorder, bipolar type 2 you name it, I've self-diagnosed it. Upon reflection of my childhood and social interactions throughout my life, it's become hard to deny that I could potentially be on the autism spectrum. And as pro-mental health and pro-be-who-you-are as I am, it CRUSHES me to know that I might have that, because I know how ostracizing it is. How hard it is to have a sense of normalcy. Sorry if that's brash, this is just comping straight from my thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

For school, I had to do a clinical rotation in a mental health facility and felt like I was ""with it"" enough to not identify with them, but *just* crazy enough to empathize and understand. 

&amp;#x200B;

I always swore I'd never get involved with SSRI's, and my education in pharmacology has confirmed I made the right choice, but man is it tempting to think about popping a pill and feeling ""changed"". 

&amp;#x200B;

None of you have the time or interest in hearing the whole shabang. That should be reserved for a therapist. I know there are underlying issues at play, but I wish I could cope better. Fuck, I spent a semester learning about coping mechanisms. A girl my age should be thriving, and I am!--only in my studies and job, I am doing great in both realms. Socially, though? Holy fuck it could not be worse. And you know what? People NEED people to survive. I NEED other people to survive. Not to define my self-worth, but to feel connected to others. To feel love and belonging. Doesn't everyone?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have a drinking problem but it depresses me to know I only had this burst of ""creativity"" and willingness to make a damn reddit post about this because I'm a couple beers deep.

25,"My apologies if this is the wrong place to ask about this but I didn’t know where else. 

Lately I have been more and more obsessed with perceived “injustices” that are happening to me. 

A couple examples. 

Someone cut me off in traffic the other day. Not bad. I tried to catch up and do I don’t know what. I think I was going to get in front just to go slow. Luckily they were too fast. 

Someone walked in front of me while I was waiting to talk to a clerk and  I felt like I was insulted and insignificant. I didn’t want to make a scene but it annoyed me all day. Part that they thought they could just figuratively push me aside and part that I didn’t stand up for myself. 

Today I came in to work an hour late and someone parked in my assigned spot. Didn’t know who it was. I must have looked out the window 10 times before noon to see if they had gone. The moment I saw someone walk to that car I was off. Not to confront them but to move my car into my spot before someone else took it. 

This can’t be normal. I don’t know what it’s called. Obsessive obviously but something else going on? Am I at the need for counseling stage it any self help advise?  The diesel for revenge is very troubling after I settle down. I have not acted on it but I’m concerned it’s heading that way. For now I am too non-confrontational to speak up for myself.

27,"I have this strange superstition almost, that there is in invisible entity which constantly judges, harasses, and degrades every action I do, no matter how minor it is. I don’t think of it in a religious or supernatural sense. And it’s not an audible voice I can hear with my years, but it is constantly speaking. When I make even the most minor or error, something only I would see, or it’s something that can be easily forgiven, this entity judges it and gives its input on it. I’m not sure why I refer to it as an entity, I wanna say I have a specific image for it, but it’s like an alternate version of me almost. But as I said, it constantly berates and degrades me. Any minor misstep I do, no matter how insignificant, it speaks its mind on the matter. It’s like it observes me constantly, watching for every intricate mistake I make. Even now typing this it feels like it is angry with me or against it. 

But anyway, to sum it all up, I just feel constantly judged by some external or internal force, (not religious, not supernatural).

For a while I've thought I have had some kind of personality disorder. It might just be my paranoia/anxiety but I've always felt like I couldn't be like everyone else, at least to a social level despite me being as social as the average teenager.

Sometimes my brain makes random situations like someone jumping in front of my car and for a bit It fills me with mixed emotions and sometimes depression. I also have an extreme fear of myself becoming abusive. A few years ago I suffered from extreme anger issues, I've broke things and said things I regret. I'm really good at masking my true self other than with my grades but I've found hobbies like video games to keep me sane. I never told anyone about my issues. I have shared some details with some buddies but not enough to the point where they really know something is wrong with me. I won't seek help due to my paranoia of people finding out I'm tired of all the ridicule. My family makes me feel like shit because they make fun of my decisions and grades.

39,I could be lying in bed all alone watching a movie on my phone or tv when something really subtle will bring back memories. I tend to remember every detail from really painful memories but with good memories it’s more hazy and emotional. In real life I tend to associate the smallest little thing with those terrible moments. However with movies it’s more of a mixed bag. They still trigger bad memories but not too long after they’ll go back to triggering happy emotions. The movies aren’t always necessarily positive or negative either. For instance I’ve recently experienced this with the movies ‘Filth’ and ‘Shazam’. They have very different vibes but both affected me in this way.,06Jun2019,1
40,"It’s so easy to tell a depressed person to just think happy thoughts, or tell a schizophrenic to just take their meds, or berate an addict for relapsing, or tell someone with ocd to ‘just stop.’ Society makes us think we’re bad people when we don’t take care of ourselves properly, that we’re lazy or we don’t care.

If we could just stop relapsing, if we could just turn it off and be happy, then there wouldn’t be a reason to call us mentally ill and addicts. We wouldn’t have to take meds or go to therapy or meetings. We wouldnt be hospitalized and medicated once every few years. I don’t have an answer for why I am the way I am anymore than anyone else. I don’t want to be this way yet I’m constantly blamed for my failures. Even with a community like this, sometimes you just feel so lonely, because it seems like everyone else is doing fine.",06Jun2019,65
41,"I have been just thinking to myself and especially imagining conversations between myself and celebrities and authors and such all day and I even spent about an hour pacing around my room and just thinking like this and I came up with realizations about what my nightmares mean and such but I was involved enough in these thoughts that I would rather be pacing around my room for an hour rather than doing anything else and I think they were distracting enough that I wouldn’t have been able to concentrate one anything else 

And even tho i spent an hour imagining myself talking to an author, I repeated myself and clarified so much in my thoughts that if I had just said it straightforward it probably would have taken up 5 minutes or less. 

I have been able to concentrate on watching some tv but not much else and I only concentrated on tv by browsing reddit at the same time 

It is 1:20 am here rn and even tho I am kinda tired I am looking forward to just being able to lay still and think for a while instead of sleeping. The thoughts aren’t particularly unpleasant or bothersome, other than it keeps me from doing all that much productive, and I want to stop whatever I am doing just to think. 

Also this all has the soundtrack of about 30seconds of music on repeat. Is this racing thoughts?",06Jun2019,2
42,"so I just basically flipped out on another thread because someone basically told me I needed to seek professional help in what was originally a very trite conversation. I'm instantly banned cause I decided to retort. 

How do we deal with these things? I definitely went off a little bit on guy and probably deserve the ban, but in no way shape or form was him telling me I needed to get checked out proper. I have a history of depression. Telling me I'm angry and needing treatment is the equivalent of calling someone a slur.

Should I give up? Start a petition? Where do I start it and who should I hand it to? I need you guys. I don't care about being banned or getting unbanned- that's not the point. My sole purpose is to make mental health blasts have some semblance of insults, because they are. 

In private messages he (the mod) completely did not see my point. As a matter of fact, he tried to argue that bringing someone's mental health into a conversation is 'nothing.'

Is there a way we can push Reddit to make blasè comments about mental health as bad as 'fuck you motherfucker'? Because to me it is. Thanks.

I'd love to hear if this happened to anyone else in or off Reddit. I'd also love to hear who I could talk to about this because I don't know anything about the power hierarchy on Reddit. I don't really want to be the face of this thing but I'm just getting tired of people throwing mental health slurs and insults around because they're WIDELY accepted.

43,"Would love some practical advice. Lately my thinking patterns are borderline neurotic, and when I'm triggered by stress I ruminate, lose focus/multitask to the point of confusion, and get stuck in negativity and self victimizing. Most of this is inwards and not expressed...I like to get these feelings OUT!  I have an organized mind so I'm pretty good at taking the time to break ideas/tasks/etc. into manageable pieces, but sometimes the stress levels get so high that I struggle with this. Once I learned how to apply logic and ""chunk"" my thinking, my outer life got more manageable mostly, but when stressed it's almost too much calculation and I feel like I get close to a point where I'll snap and have a mental health breakdown; my thoughts seem to hang right around the tipping point between max productivity and just complete chaotic neuroses.  I just don't process stress well and it's also my biggest trigger for substance abuse. Really, I just want to learn how to process stress better.

45,"I’m prefacing this by saying I don’t want to come off as some overly entitled or privileged resident who wants to “clean their streets” so to speak. Like the title says I am located in the Bay Area, California (not SF). 

There is a woman who lives on the streets and in parks in my neighborhood with a severe psychological condition that appears to render her incapable of normal interaction. Out of respect for her and privacy for me I will not go into the details of her behavior, which is highly patterned, but the phrases she repeats are either completely unintelligible or very explicitly violent. She also frequently approaches people on the streets during her episodes and aggressively shouts at them . On more than one occasion I have seen her exhibit this behavior towards children (and myself, frequently as I live near a park she lives in) and she has even appeared to try and follow me into my home. For the few years that I’ve lived here I have observed this behavior from her all over the city, which has a very large homeless population, and by far her mental state is the most troubling I have witnessed. 

I am in no way an expert but I suspect she is past the point of rehabilitation. I am frightened that she may be at risk of harming others or herself. If it were not for the large amount of children in my neighborhood maybe I would not be so concerned, but to be clear: I have never witnessed her perform a violent act, only approach others shouting in an aggressive manner. I would like to put in an effort to help get her under professional psychiatric care. I am hoping that somebody on this sub might be aware of national or local (Bay Area) resources, such as a nonprofit, that work to obtain care for severely disabled persons.",06Jun2019,1
46,"I’ve had depression and chronic anxiety since puberty. I started medication when I was 15 and have been on them regularly since (now 19). I still live at home for college. 
My dad doesn’t do anything. He’s like a child with the freedoms of an adult. My mom didnt divorce him bc cultural norms (were Pakistani but live in America). My moms a doctor, and she works, so we’ve been fine financially. But she also does all the housework. Won’t hire a maid either. So my whole life my mothers been miserable, constantly either complaining about my dad (which I think is rightfully so) or me/my sister or no specifically everyone, says she’s abused by us, works like a servant, etc. basically it’s been hammered into me that my sister, my dad, and I are bad and she is a saint. 
I’ve tried my whole life and I’ve been trying to help: do dishes, laundry, etc. but it’s like she races me to it. I would do it if she asked me to, but she just does it herself. If she tells me/would tell me to do something I will get to it, although it may not be immediately. 
Dad: is sick now. Getting to the point where he needs help going to the bathroom at night. Is fine home alone though. 
Me: I’m in college on a full ride, I have a 4.0, I’m going to med school soon and looking at top 20s, which is what she wanted me to do. I don’t disrespect her or raise my voice at her. I genuinely try to be (and pretty sure am) pleasant (bc she’ll laugh when she’s in a good mood)
How I do/have helped her consistently : she ran a private practice while I was in high school. I worked there while not in school as nurse/receptionist. I took care of all the IT stuff. Now I pick my sister up from school. I help my sister with homework. If she asks, I will do the laundry/dishes/clean the cat litter when she does. I don’t do it regularly bc my she always beats me to it. 
Lately it just feels like it’s amping up. Everything I say she finds a way to attack me. Example: we were making a casserole together. Some of it didn’t fit in the tray. I said we can eat the left over ground meat as is instead of making another casserole. She says but you’re always holding your stomach (I’m currently trying to lose a little weight). “How are you going to lose weight if you sleep all day?” 
I don’t sleep all day every day. On weekends, yes, till the afternoon. I’ve had 12 hour days at school this past year. Even now I have research and volunteering on weekdays pretty much 9-5. She constantly complains of being in pain from working too much, but doesn’t even lie down?? Will keep doing chores in ridiculous hours like waking up early to wash dishes or staying up late. Also threatens with her imminent death/going crazy from all this work. 
I try to help out where I can, and she is my world. It just feels like she wants me to be a full time homemaker/fill in for my dad but I can’t do that with school.

47,"Once, I was a social butterfly, an extrovert, the life of the party, considered always happy, and I had a huge number of friends. Fast forward 5 years to now, where I have just recently cut myself off from my only remaining friends. (I had about 5 close ones, my D&amp;D group basically.) 

It would be very difficult and complicated to explain why I have done this, but basically my options were change who I am as a person or lose my friends, and I was just not able to change who I am as a person. 

Anyway, so I’ve found myself for the first time in my life without any close friends - I am (was? I don’t even know now) a very intimacy based person and now I have no friends at all other than some online gaming friends who I’m not intimately close with. 

I feel so angry at the friends I cut off from, and so angry at the world, and I feel like my only option now is to turn all my emotions off and be a callous, cruel, and cold hearted person for the rest of my life who doesn’t do intimacy or love or affection. The other option involves a lot of emotional pain that I can’t  really handle and wouldn’t really achieve anything anyway. 

This is such a sad way to turn out, and I feel like I’m just going to spend the rest of my life existing unhappily. I can’t kill myself because I could never do that to my mum. Maybe when she dies later on in my life I will kill myself. I also researched what prison was really like in the U.K. because I considered just getting myself arrested so I don’t have to worry about my future, but again I couldn’t do that to my mum. 

I can’t afford therapy and I am too afraid of medication, I really want a brain scan because I have lots of sociopathic tendencies and a lot of trouble with things and concepts that most find natural. But again that’s money. I am poor, lonely, unfit, depressed, I have extreme motivational issues, and I just have no idea what to do. I can’t see there being any way out. I am only posting on here because I have no friends left to say this stuff to, but I would feel guilty saying this to friends anyway because they are not therapists.

48,"Hi guys,

I have this mental block that won't go away.

I believe it's there because I didn't help a friend, when she was in need, and now I can't forget about it.

I talked to my friend and she forgave me, even though she didn't expect too much from me, and said that she would never want me to be in this position I am in now, but it hasn't helped with the mental block.

I tried meditation and taught myself the state of the art techniques for handling anxiety and ocd. But they don't work.

When i try to think deep to solve, say, a hard maths problem, I kind of lose my train of thought.

When you solve math problems, you have to meditate, you have to let go so that you can grab the answer from the universe. But i can't let go.

Accessing my subconscious mind is hopeless because I don't have a gut feeling right now. I dunno why, it's blocked.

I want to see if i can get deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus.

Do you think that would help? Or, is there any procedure or anything that would work?

I need my brain to finish my work on Human Protothecosis and E. Coli, which is basically my purpose.

Your help is much appreciated.

Thanks,

50,"Hey there...

I am struggling at the moment, so please forgive any miscommunication or rambling I give.

It's hard to know where to begin, as everything is so confusing to me at the time.

I am a thirty year old woman.

I suffer from unipolar depression, and have since I was eleven. Not wanting to give too many details, I had quite a rough upbringing. Suffice to say, it was physically and mentally abusive, leaving me somewhat broken in spirit.

Over the years, I have tried to kill myself several times, but my last attempt was at eighteen. I have since found a reason to live every day, hyping up my joy in things, with hopes it will outweigh the negative.

Suffering with pressure, I began to self mutilate at a young age. For many years, it carried on, every cut and burn forever a reminder of my hurtful heart. It was a mixture of feelings, and no feelings. A dark place in my life that I absolutely despise. Though, that improved as well, as I fought my way through it.

Eventually, I met my husband. We were young adults then, fresh from highschool. It always seemed a distant relationship, even from the start.

Perhaps I was desperate for a connection, or perhaps I felt something more in potential for what we had...

In any case, we dated for many years, with ups and downs. Going through young adulthood together was a strange experience. I began to feel isolated, until I had no friends except his, or those connected to his. 

It did not seem intentional on his part... Just kind of ended up that way.

Because of my issues, I do not drive. Another thing I am chastised for, because of constant misunderstanding. 

Anyway, this isolates me further, as I mostly stay at home. I found solice in my joy of online gaming, and writing, as I could still express myself to others without the pressures of nervousness that presence brings.

This works for a while, until I begin to feel pressure from my husband about how much I enjoy talking to others, or how much time I spend alleviating myself with the enchantment of a seperate reality. Keep in mind, this is a shared hobby, as he also enjoys games equal amount to me. 

In any case, this was my first indicator something didn't feel right. I always achieved what I needed to before indulging in gaming, though he always treated my hobbies as if they were an irritant.

Fast forward.

Many years pass, many things happen.

Though, the most important is our marriage, and ultimately, the birth of my twins. 

Granted, it is difficult for anyone to raise kids. Though, I have been having particularly rough times lately, combating myself. Becoming a stay at home mother was my decision, but it can be extremely overwhelming for me.

I have expressed this to my husband many times, in many different ways, over the course of many months. With little to no response, mostly him making me feel dumb for expressing to begin with.

Now, I want it to be clear my husband is a good man, and a good father. It's just impossible to relate my mind to him.

Maybe we all feel that way... That it is so difficult to connect to another human being. But, it was told from a very young age to him, what my past was and who I am, what I had to offer. I guess I just didn't expect the pressures from the one person who had saved me.

It's so painful to think that I can't rely on anyone to help with my issues, not even the man I married. Not that I expect him to help, but perhaps not encourage the horrible negativity that overwhelms me.

In the past two weeks, I have had two nervous breakdowns. One was alone, in front of my children, making me feel so useless as a parent.

When mentioned, all I receive is 'calm down's and 'it is fine' statements. More often than that, things are completely ignored or passed off. 

I have mentioned I'd like to see a psychologist again, as I had stopped seeing one at age sixteen. I saw my old one for two days. My husband drilled me on what we talked about, and then proceeded to tell me my psychologist talked about himself too much. We then moved away, and I have since mentioned again perhaps I should see someone, even if someone else. It is mostly met with apprehension, as if 'I don't need it.'

Then again, when I try to express myself to him, I am often accused of being too focused on myself and not him. Though, not to be spiteful, but he never wants to talk about his own feelings until my feelings are about to explode and I begin to unload.

A few days ago, after a heated argument over me having an anxiety attack in public, I gave a vague threat of suicide in my panicked, closed argument with him.

To which I was responded with, 'fuck you.'

I understand, it was an arguement and we all say things we don't mean, but I honestly didn't expect that. It is not something I have even brought up in many years, despite the waning thought.

Honestly, it was a cry for help. For understanding, for love even.

The rest of the night, he completely avoided me, leaving me in the stirring of my dark thoughts.

A few uncomfortable days later, we discuss the incident, me trying my hardest to calmly rationalize my feelings, while being talked at rather than to. It's hurtful, as I really took a patient tone with every word, and was only met with a raised voice telling me I wasn't listening to him when he told me I was 'too sensitive.'

We eventually came to a sort of understanding, where I asked of him that we could talk of things before they came to a boiling point, as I truly despise raised voices and arguments. I felt satisfied that he understood.

Yet.

Tonight, I sit here in the dark, typing this out of pure frustration feeling completely and utterly lost.

It's been only a few days, and aleady he had returned to old ways. I'm not asking for a hero, I just wish he would talk to me, instead of leaving me alone when I clearly need some consolation.

It's hard to imgaine a world without him, but also, he seems to have little interest working with me on anything.

When I express myself he comes across quite ignorant to these complex feelings, even when I beg him to just try, he never knows what to say.

I don't know, maybe we are just a bad match, but I feel like at this point there is no turning back. I love him so much, it just really hurts and confuses me when he disregards me after I specifically tell him on days I am vulnerable... And the preceding guilt I receive for mentioning it just seems wrong.

To be clear, I do not want to kill myself. I just hate to think that when I am circulating on the thought and trying my best to avoid it... He refuses to aid in any way.

Maybe I am asking too much. Perhaps the wires of my brain are just misfiring, and looking for problems.

But if someone you loved threatened suicide, would you completely ignore them?",06Jun2019,6
51," There is no timetable for how long grief lasts, or how you should feel after a particular time. After twelve months it may still feel as if everything happened yesterday, or it may feel like it all happened a lifetime ago. These are some of the feelings you might have when you are coping with grief longer-term.  
Learning to live with the loss of someone you love can take a long time, and just as everyone’s grief is different, so each person feels differently as time passes.  


It generally takes about a year to realise how much has changed in your life, both emotionally and practically. Some things only come up once a year, like celebrating a birthday, or doing something the person who has died used to do, like renewing the car insurance. Each time one of these things happens, you are reminded of your loss, and your feelings of grief may come to the surface.  


It may feel as if you are on emotional roller coaster, where one minute you are coping and the next you feel overwhelmed by grief. You are likely to find you have some good days and some bad days.  


As time passes, the balance between good days and bad days shifts and gradually you will find you have more good days and fewer bad days. But these changes are gradual, and each person is different, so the balance for you may not be the same as someone else after the same length of time.  


Some of the physical symptoms of grief, such as having trouble sleeping and losing your appetite, also lessen over time. Taking care of yourself by eating well, getting some exercise and sleeping will help you to feel better in yourself and to cope.  
Although the intensity of your feelings may lessen over time, there is no timetable for how long you will grieve. The length of time is different for each person. For most people, it is a long process and it can take years. After about two years you are likely to know the places, events, and occasions that trigger your emotions. As you start to know these, you will also learn what helps you to cope with them. After a while people around you – family, friends, and colleagues at work – may forget what you have been through, or may encourage you to move on. You yourself may even feel that you ought to have moved on. But the goal is not to move on. Your grief is not something that can or should be ‘fixed’. The goal is to find a way to live with and cope with your feelings.  
You may eventually come to a point where your feelings of grief are a reminder of the person, and that in itself can be a source of comfort. Coping with grief longer-term We have described below some of the feelings people have told us they experience over time. You may feel some or all of these and many other feelings too.  


Some Common Frustrating Symptoms :  


1. I thought I was doing fine, but now I feel worse: There are lots of reasons why you might find that over time you feel your grief more rather than less. In the early stages, you may be caught up in a whirlwind of things that you need to do and sort out.  


Friends, relatives and even work colleagues, are likely to be very conscious of what has happened and make time and effort to support you. But gradually things settle down and support from friends and relatives wanes. Only then do you have the time and space to understand how different your life is without the person you loved and to grieve for that loss.  


You may find that you aren’t able to grieve at first because you have caring responsibilities. For example, if you have young children or perhaps an elderly relative that you need to look after, your initial focus may be on supporting them. Your own feelings of grief might be delayed. It may only be later that it feels real that the person has died, as you are able to make space for your own sense of grief. You may feel very angry at first. Feeling angry is very common, for example, if your friend or relative was diagnosed late, but might have lived if they were diagnosed earlier, or if there were issues with their treatment.  


2. Little things take me by surprise and suddenly I feel overwhelmed by grief : Over time, you will find a way to live with some of the more day-to-day reminders of the person you love. It is some of the unpredictable things, like a song on the radio, or finding one of their belongings in a drawer, that can trigger unexpected feelings. It can be particularly hard when this happens in public, for example, if you see someone’s favorite cake in the supermarket.  


Although it is completely normal to be upset, you might feel uncomfortable with being emotional in public. Unfortunately, it may make it harder than other people often don’t know how to respond when this happens.  


Although other people may not know how to handle it if this happens to you, and may pretend that they haven’t noticed, it is not wrong for you to feel or act like this. In fact it is completely understandable. Although it is hard, you shouldn’t feel embarrassed.  
3. I can’t face socialising or meeting up with friends

  
4. People think I should move on, but I can’t : It is common for other people, perhaps because they find it hard to cope with your grief, to encourage you to move on. People may even say that the person you loved would not have wanted you to still be grieving.

  
5. I want to talk about my partner, but others don’t : Don't hide it. Others will take their lead from you. If talking about them make you comfortable, go ahead.

  
6. People don’t think I should be grieving at all: We all don't have the same level of relationship with the deceased. People may feel based on the relationship that exists between you both, there isn't a need to grieve. I would say go ahead and grieve if that would make you feel better.  
   
Finally, it is important to state here that no one can tell you how long to grieve but you can heal if and end it faster with the help of a grief counselor or therapist.

52,"Copied + pasted from my post in a dating advice subreddit; it got no attention there except from my best friend the automod, so here’s hoping.


I've been feeling lately like I over-romanticize relationships, tend to commit heavily early on and then drop off suddenly, and tie my happiness too closely to whether or not I'm seeing somebody. I'm finally recognizing that this isn't healthy behavior, and that it's been going on for a while.

I'm relatively sure (though not completely) that a lot of it stems from coming from divorced parents, one with an anger problem and the other with drug addiction. I've got absolutely no idea what a healthy relationship looks like, and I think I've just taken all my cues thus far from rom-coms and sci-fi novels. In the past year and a half of dating/college, I’ve flip-flopped between stretches of one night stands and crazy intense relationships that are “fine on paper” but that I feel little to nothing for. Then, as soon as I’m out of them, it hits. No matter what I do, I find my heart hurting over things it shouldn’t; I feel like a middle-schooler who’s just found out their crush is dating someone else, *all the time when I’m not seeing someone*. 

Where can I learn what a good relationship is? How do I stop feeling this way?

I am afraid to make another appointment with her just to be let down and have to reschedule. I'm losing trust in her and I'm not making progress as I've had only two sessions in six weeks.

58,My cat hates me. She taunts me all the time. The other day I heard her say that In a useless weak human being.   I try to be nice to her but she only loves me for the food I feed her. The other day we were sitting on the couch and acid was coming out of her mouth onto my leg. I had to go to the hospital to have the burns treated. I don’t know what to do. I think she is possessed and is currently under the name Damien. Please help I’m a simple woman with limited means. Is there anything on the internet on how to perform an exorcism? Thanks in advance.

59,"- Excessive daydreaming and placing myself in random and at often unrealistic scenarios. This has been going on since as far as I can remember. I can recall distinct instances and daydreams from when I attended the first school I went to, which I moved on from in the second grade. 
- I love to learn. I love to read. I love to create and write. However, under one circumstance. It has to be under my terms and under what I enjoy. I often skip school to sleep in and procrastinate and it’s caused me to even failing two classes in high school. Despite this, my test scores are one of the highest in my classes. I enjoy the classes too. I just can’t seem to find the motivation to do the work in said classes if I don’t feel like it. It’s weird too. If I read, and I don’t like the book for feel ‘forced’ to do so, I could read an entire book and not even remember reading it.
- Talking too much or adding unnecessary or awkward comments, then regretting or overthinking the comments made by me after making them. 
- I’m prescribed a sleeping medication, which is fifty milligrams of Serequel before bedtime. If I don’t take the medication, I don’t sleep. It’s as simple as that. I don’t need it, it seems. 
- It seems as if I constantly fidget or feel the need. I just constantly need to move. I move. I sometimes walk around daydream and play music, for hours, while literally just walking in a circle. I sometimes drive just to think more and move at the same time. I always need to move and think. 
- I can’t live without stimulation. This worries me as I feel like this could potentially hurt me it terms of taking substances to achieve this stimulation. I feel over sexual sometimes, I constantly need to check and be on my phone, I constantly need to listen to my music, like constantly too. As in I listen to music maybe five to seven hours a day. This isn’t an exaggeration. 

I’ve been on Depakote and Zoloft for what they’ve diagnosed as Bipolar 2. Despite this. These are the issues I still have. Mood seems to be stable while on these medicines, and I do feel happier since taking them (I’ve been on them for four months, and this is my second time on them), but at the time I started these medicines, I was in a much darker place in terms of my life quality. Life has improved tremendously, so I don’t know how much I accredit the medicine to me being happier, or just life being better. 

I stopped taking my medicines for a couple of months once, which was the the first time I was on them. I tried Adderall XR 30mg for 4 days straight, and stopped because my heart rate was starting to scare me as it’d be in the mid 130s randomly by the 4th day, as well as the medicine just feeling unusual by then. 

I did make two notes back then when I took them. Here is how I felt on the adderall.

It’s hard to explain how I feel on the current medications because of their long lasting effects rather than being instant.

I’m 18 by the way, and despite my counselor somewhat hinting at a possible adhd diagnosis, her as well as my physiatrist (who’s insanely strict), won’t diagnose me with adhd due to them “not diagnosing adults” with the disease. Even though these issues have been occurring throughout life and are not a new thing. And yes, my counselor knows I’ve tried adhd and that it seemed to help, my psychiatrist does not and I don’t believe I’ll ever tell him due to the fact he’d most likely drop me as a client. He almost dropped me as a client once for being on my phone during an appointment. 

Anyways, thank you for reading. I’ll try to answer any questions. Sorry if this feel poorly structured or wrote wrong. It’s very late and I’m just nervous because I have an appointment coming up soon in which they may review me for adhd, although I doubt they’ll actually make the diagnosis due to my age. Thank you.",06Jun2019,1
60,"My therapist wants me to practice getting more in touch my feelings since i'm pretty numb and unintentionally hold them back, but i'm sceptical... I haven't had an apropriate amount of emotions in probably 10 years, so i don't really remember what it's like but i don't remember it as being very fun. His main argument was that it takes a lot of energy to push them back but for the most part i don't feel like i am pushing them back, just as if they just aren't there. I'm also kind of worried about, if i will change as a person, mainly if my sense of humor (which is pretty fucked up) will change and i won't find things very funny anymore. And if i'm going to start ""opening up"" to people lol, because that seems horrible. Also doesn't it feel a bit pretention to have fully functioning emotions, like seeing someone drive a nice, but loud, car and you get a bit jealous but then you realize that they probably suck and have a fucked up sense of reality because life has never fucked them and they think that they are invincible and has the biggest dicks on the planet but they are just massive bitch narcissists? essentially what i mean is that being dead inside feels more down to earth and humble to me, more like the kind of person i'd like to be around.

I tell my gf that I'm feeling way out of my depth, and try to be honest with her so she doesn't feel like she's a problem. It's the furthest I have got in a relationship with anyone and I am in uncharted waters, she is also the same. So we are both working it out. I honestly didn't think it would be this hard. I've moved to places by myself and it's been manageable but I honestly think it's the depression which is totally kicking my ass.

Disclaimer: I don't really know why I'm typing out my life story right now but I just hope maybe if I give enough details about my upcoming somebody will relate in a specific way and be able to help me out of my rut.  


Pretty much as long as I can remember, there's always been something ""off"" about me I guess. I grew up in a pretty mentally abusive household, where the only person who wasn't terrible to me told me that the best thing to do was just ignore it. So right away, the only coping mechanism I was taught was to bottle up my emotions. I'd get yelled at basically everyday for doing nothing, by someone I thought was supposed to love me. Throughout Elementary school I was too timid to learn how to be social and I have high functioning aspergers so I kinda just lashed out autistically at other kids causing me to get bullied to shit, ngl I kinda deserved it for how much of an annoying little shit I was but some of these kids were brutal. Grade 4 I got pulled out of the year early cause of how much the other kids were treating confused me like shit. Some kid in grade 6 or something tried choked me a couple times, thought that dude was gonna kill me lol. I would cry everyday at school, then cry myself to sleep that night, all because I didn't understand really anything about why the world was kinda shit. Around middle school I guess I got tired of being inept at everything and I got a lot better at socializing and shit, still kinda sucked and I was really really emotionless during this time, probably just recovering from bullying or some shit idrk. Most of middle school was pretty uneventful apart from that. When I got to highschool is when my brain really started to fuck with me for some reason, I thought I was just doing normal teenager stuff yknow, getting really intense mood swings several times a day, beating the shit out of myself sometimes for it, making really fucking irrational decisions and saying a lot of really fucking stupid shit to some people. It's a pretty difficult time to think about because I have a lot of regrets from it, as I didn't have the self control I taught myself. After a year I got a bit better, highschool life, made some friends, girlfriend, etc. Suddenly, I get hit with super super fucking bad insecurity and absolutely demolish my entire life. I'm back to having basically no one, never leaving my room, failing class, and I spent almost all of last year doing that. Over the course of this year, I have learned to understand a lot more things about myself, I have gained a lot of confidence, a lot of intelligence, and a lot of popularity. None of this matters to me. No matter what I have done in my life, I cannot bring myself to give a shit. Every action I see from everyone seems so empty, everything I do feels pointless. My mood swings have persisted since they began, and almost went away for a while, then came back worse than ever before. I started doing drugs because everything was so boring and empty to me and after a few months, drugs started feeling empty too. I genuinely feel like I have run out of life, is this how it feels to burn out young? Am I just simply an edgy, angsty teen? I've seen counselors about this but I've never been able to see a real therapist due to where I live, they say I'm quite clearly depressed but they can't diagnose me properly. I've studied into a lot of psychology for a while and, luckily, I'm past the self diagnosing phase. I've tried to make some educated guesses, but my brain works in such an abstract way. When I say ""Nobody understands"" I don't mean it in a ripped black skinny jeans sitting on a swingset in the rain yelling at the sky type of way, I mean I genuinely have never met a person that understands my though processes. I hope someone here can provide me with some kind of answer, thank you for reading this far if you did, and I hope I didn't come off as completely crazy.",06Jun2019,1

67,"I was prescribed Seroquel when I was 21 and after eight years(!) I've recently decided to quit. 

My therapist stands by my decision to slowly tapering off the meds, and I'm really grateful that I've finally met a professional who has a progressive perspective on mental illness and recovery.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the years I feel like the meds have robbed me of my feelings, personality and desire to spend time with other people. This is, of course, not how I intend to spend the rest of my life.   
However, I can't help but being a bit apprehensive about life after Seroquel. I'm not particularly afraid of relapsing, but rather the thought of returing to the 'real' world and dealing with moods and feelings again - it seems potentially overwhelming.

68,"Hi all,

I'm hoping someone will be able to give me a bit of guidance on how to help my new partner, who is having a severe depressive episode.  

For context, I have had severe, suicidal depression several times in the past and I am now (mostly) managing my mood with the help of medication that I have now been taking for over 4 years. Over that time I've been stable enough to learn that my depression is mostly a symptom of anxiety, and that my anxiety is mostly triggered by overthinking interactions with other people.  

My partner's depression is very different to mine - he is amazingly driven and motivated in his career (running his own business) but sometimes takes on too much and completely breaks down with the stress of getting everything done on his own. He experiences things I completely recognise - hopelessness, despair, being completely consumed by negative thoughts to the point of being unable to do anything else - but I am worried that the very different roots of our depression will cause me to make incorrect assumptions about how to help him.  

He has been amazing when I have had anxious periods and I want to be able to support him as well as he has supported me. When he comes out the other side of this episode I will definitely speak to him about what he feels would help, but at the moment I really don't want him to feel like teaching me how to support him is another thing he needs to stress over while he's already very low.  

Can anyone with experience of anything similar offer any advice on what to do right now to help him if he is struggling to tell me what he needs?  

Thank you so much in advance for your help.",06Jun2019,2
69,"Im in grade 11. I was moved to an independent study school (pretty much like homeschooling but I go to school once a week to turn in assignments) since I was absent for 3 weeks at my old public school. Before those 3 weeks, I was already skipping school once or twice a week bcuz I just absolutely have no motivation at all for school and yet... I still worry and care about my assignments but I don’t do them. So at my new school all work is done at home and I have one week to finish all my hw. I did well the first week and turned it in on time surprisingly. But I slowly began to not turning them in on time. And in this school, its unacceptable to turn in late hw and if I kept doing that, I’ll eventually be removed from the school. I got worse... and I ended up not finishing 3 weeks of assignments. They gave me alot of chances to turn them in on another day but I hated that, it made me feel guilty for some reason. Right now, tomorrow, I have to turn in 2 hw packets which were both due a couple days ago. But the thing is.. I never even started and finished those packets and theyre all due tomorrow morning. Idek why I’m even stressing out about my hw when I clearly don’t even do them. Honestly, my lack of motivation is insane.. even back when I was still doing regular schooling, i did ok on tests/quizes, but not doing hw and essays was what made all my grades drop to Fs.. I completely never did hw unless if I finished them in class. I’ve always had this problem since kindergarten and I’m shocked that I was able to make it to middle school, heck, even high school. Well... 7th grade was a bad depressing year for me, I stopped going to school for most the year and I honestly wanted to die. Locked myself in my room and played video games and draw art to escape from my own problems. And now its somewhat happening again, in 11th grade. I’m literally just a recluse, i never go outside, I just draw, play video games, eat, sleep. I feel very distant from my family which is really sad to me bcuz we used to be very goofy and loud during my childhood until some bad things happen which Im not gonna get into. Most days it feels like I’m the only one living in the house, just me and my drawings. But yeah, even homeschooling isnt working out for me. I thought it would be better but I guess not. I feel like I’ve been given way to many chances that I don’t deserve because I end up not doing the work anyway. I’d be surprised if I even graduate from high school bcuz I really feel like dropping out right about now. I really want to become an animator or something with an art related career. I’ve had that dream since I was 4. But the ways my life has been going on right now, with myself, how will that even happen?

70,"I have NEVER raised my voice at my parents. As a child i swallowed my tears and thought about something else whenever they shouted about me being worthless and lazy and stupid

Today was different. I usually wake up to my dad screaming and it doesn't really affect me that much. But now It was 8am and i had only slept 4 hours. School began in 30mins but it was the last day of school, so no one really went. 

So i go downstairs and i say ""dad, i'm gonna be really late and it's the last day, i don't think i should go today"". I said this especially because i had a concert coming up and i wanted to practise. Big mistake

I was litterally half asleep and didn't know what the fuck was going on, he started screaming the usual shit, how he lets me do whatever i want and he never beats me and i'm lazy blah blah. I get the idea, so i'm trying to get dressed for school but he starts escalating and escalating. 

He started asking me 100 questions per second which i couldn't procces atm. I became scared because i couldn't understand a word and i didn't want him to come into my room. He starts threatening me, asking things i don't remember, and i couldn't even hear my own thoughts so i shouted. I said ""I GET IT! I'LL GO TO FUCKING SCHOOL! I JUST WOKE UP, LET ME GET DRESSED"" 

I have never yelled in my entire life, i think that was the loudest thing to ever come out of my mouth. I realised what i had just did and started to cry. I apologised immediately, my voice was suuper raspy. I was so panicked. 

You know the calm before the storm? That's how it felt like. The silence scared me so much. Apparently he left the house while i was getting dressed. I said ok. I shamefully went downstairs and attempted to say bye to my mom, only for her to yell that i was so disrespectful. Which, i knew that. 

I was so fucking drowsy i was still wearing my pijama shirt and forgot where the bus was. I had cash on me so i called a taxi. The taxi arrived in 1 minute and i'm trying to cross the street an get in the car when i see my dad coming from the other side, Yelling for me to get the fuck back inside. He shouts at the driver to cancel and go away. 

As i mentioned, i was still half aleep, so all my defense mechanisms were shut down completely. There was nothing left that could make me act rational, or ignore him. I was psychologically defensless. I was so fucking scared. He never beat me but i was convinced i was gonna get it. I couldn't control myself. I started bawling and saying i'm sorry over and over. I sounded like a child and it felt weird.

He dragged me in the house yelling ""you're not going anywhere like that, why the fuck are you crying"" etc

He basically threw me in the hallway and my legs gave away so i sat on the floor. He continued yelling and yelling for no apparent reason (i couldn't decipher what it was about). I apparently had a full mental collapse or something because i've never cried in front of ANYONE EVER. But i was bawling so damn loud. I think he was freaked out too. Which made him more angry. 

He stomped upstairs and told me to come too, so i did. My mom was making coffee while he continued to do his thing. I was trying to get something to eat. He kept closing the fridge and saying all i eat is shit and that's why i'm a lunatic who cries at nothing all the time (i've never cried before but ok dad) 

My mom left and he basically cornered me in the kitchen saying i was crying because i'm guilty and i'm trying to get away with being a horrible person by gathering sympathy. I sat there trying to get my defense mechanisms to work but i just shouted again and said ""i'm sorry for being such a shitty child, can i just go now please"" 

I went upstairs and listened to George Carlin talk about corruption and whatever so i wouldn't hear the two arguing downstairs. It didn't work and i started crying at jokes so that's nice. 

I'm fully woked up now and i'm SO embarassed. And alse freaked out. I've never let myself go like that. Not even as a lonely scared kid, my defenses never let me down.... What happened? Is it just that i was sleep deprived? I kinda hate myself for habing a fucking breakdown in front of MY DAD but. Shit happens

Sorry if i'm on the wrong sub, just neet to get this off my chest. I can't just tell my friends i cried like a little baby because my dad yelled

Very small moments like these completely shift my mood in all aspects of my day - now I don’t want to apply, don’t want to get out of bed, don’t want to do anything.

Didn’t know if this was normal to feel or not (and why I avoid watching news in the first place).

76,"I’m at a lost here. I told my parents that I needed counselling and a psychiatric evaluation years ago. A week ago, I got it. I was finally, finally diagnosed with severe depression, anxiety and stress. The psychiatrist told me that it’s not normal to be so scared about a lot of things and gave me two choice, either I get medication or psychotherapy and medication. I didn’t know which one to choose so he got my mom in. 

When my mom came in, she looked bored out of her mind and she looked like she didn’t believe a single word he said. He even told her that “it’s not something she dreamt up” and that “she can’t deal with this alone. She needs help” but she hasn’t done a single thing to help me get better. She refuses to believe that I have these problems because I smile and laugh a lot. I do those in front of her because it’s better than to explain to them my problems only to have them say “You’re overthinking. Stop overthinking and you won’t have these problems”. 

She was adamant on me not getting medication because she says that it’ll fuck up my body badly in the long run. I’ve discussed this with my friends and came to a conclusion that I need help, I don’t care what kind of help but I need help. I decide to compromise and went for only psychotherapy instead. 

I kept asking her how it’s going because I’m at my wits end and my work and studies are being affected by this. She told me that she’s worried that this will affect my chances of getting work in the psychiatry field and to think properly before jumping to conclusions. I was crushed because this is her way of saying “No. you’re not getting help”. 

I had a panic attack a few days ago and it scared me so badly I went to sleep at 5am. I was lucky enough to have friends awake at 3am to help me through them. Then, yesterday, I had a big mental breakdown where I cried on and off for a whole 4 hours. 

I don’t know what else to do. My mom is convinced this is just a phase and that I’ll get over this with the power of positive thinking. My dad refuses to acknowledge I have problems and need help. He stays out of anything that has to do with my mental health and it’s driving me insane.

That being said, I would say I'm more interested in the worlds my mind conjures up, than anything the world currently has to offer myself. Maybe that doesn't sound that weird. Lots of people create fantasy worlds, and a lot of people use them to create the finest art.

If I could label myself, I believe the most fitting term I could come up with to describe myself is an escapist by any and all means.

This means I distract myself with an over abundance of media and art just so my mind can laser focus on one thing. These issues have also evolved into struggles with addiction, and an obsession with mind altering substances from time to time. It's the only way I know how to shut off the thoughts. This problem is so bad, and so tied with my conflicting traits of low self esteem and my prideful need to accomplish goals on my own, that the world around me falls apart. My surroundings become filth and garbage, not out of ""laziness,"" but out of a crippling fear that I will fuck up even the most minute task, and an overwhelming sense of hopelessness in regards to developing good habits such as cleaning, hygiene, and maintaining health. I don't defend my actions in almost any circumstance because I know I am to blame, however I vehemently reject the numerous accusations that I'm lazy because I can guarantee I have thought over the task in a minute probably more than a regular person would in a lifetime. Throughout childhood and into my adult life, any task given to me from, say my parents, like cleaning my room, or mowing the lawn, even tasks that would take upwards of ten minutes of my day could literally send me spiralling. I would become lethargic, need to mentally prepare myself before doing these tasks, experience a spectrum of emotions while doing the tasks, and would likely need to spend the rest of the day ""shutting my brain off."" These over abundance of thoughts lead to sometimes dangerous fantasies where I dream of having everything from Cancer, dreaming of becoming crippled, hospitalized indefinitely, being labelled handicapped in any capacity by society and opting out of the grind called life. Not suicide per se, but living like a vegetable. These fantasies have lead to unhealthy jealousy of those who have been robbed of the ability to live the lives they themselves wished they had, or did have and can no longer return to. It creates a never ending cycle of depression and disgust of myself. Especially when comparing myself to my saints of parents, who both have physical and mental handicaps from physical traumas and health scares such as my Mother's stroke. I have been privileged to have been given clean slates in the past, and while I do attest that starting from scratch does shrink the thoughts, it does not eliminate them, and shortly after, I will find myself in a new hole. After years of job hopping to find the least stressful career for someone like me, and enduring challenges that life threw my way that legitimately weren't my fault, I spiralled and eventually stopped working all together, but even with collecting unemployment, the lack of purpose, the increasing depression, and the compulsion to blow all my money, I managed to spend all the money I was making on new and exciting, often expensive distractions, and eventually I started becoming more and more late with rent each month. I was forced back into the working world, but my habits lead me to still be evicted, alienating my roommates who used to be best friends of mine, but who have now chosen to not include me in their lives. My social skills feel like they are nose diving too, as I haven't felt like my true self in almost four years, starting with a tragic year of death, the dissolution of my family as a unit, being let go from a lucrative job (which I hated to begin with, but it fed my escapism with enough left over to live a life) and being forced into finding my own living arrangements for the truly first time. I now live with my Dad, rent free, working an under the table job, which while suits my needs, is far from a stable career, as I watch my childhood dog slowly deteriorate in health. I have about 10k worth of debt at this point, but my habits have prevented me in chipping away at this debt and my credit score is plummeting. I am lonely, and with a lot of free time on my hands, which has lead to some positive activity, but I cannot consistently maintain these activities either. I have had Panic Attacks sporadically over the past four years, and in my youth, and my most recent one sent me to the hospital. This most recent Panic Attack was fueled on by a mega dose of marijuana, and created an entirely vivid hallucination that combined real childhood memories with my disgusting subconscious desire to be pitied and spared, into what I believed was a repressed memory of me being molested by my Sister's Father. It was horrible, and I spent over 30 hours awake and was taken to the hospital by my Father. I believed it for weeks, but at this point, as the false memory has been over and over analyzed, I 100% believe my mind fabricated it as a way to ""compete"" with my parents and their ailments and it disgusts me to my very fibre. I unfortunately communicated this hallucination to my parents, who thankfully thought it wise to not tell my sister and further damage the reputation of a man who was truly kind to me my whole life. Despite all of this, I still think I have further to go, before hitting rock bottom. I still have people who care about me, despite my baggage. I don't want to lose them. I do have goals in my life still. I want to create art in all it's many forms, I want to be financially stable, I want to love and be loved by a woman, I want to be a father, and a good one at that. I want to teach and inspire others, and be a true role model. I am aware that I am not just a husk and that I have some legitimate intelligence and can empathize with damn near everybody, but the intelligence has yet to be a match for my chaotic emotions. I am in the process of seeking mental help, but of course I have been the cause of delay for that for years. I am truly my own worst enemy. There is a girl in my life now, and we are playing it casual in the meantime, but I have burgeoning feelings for her, and it would mean the world to me if I can find a way to hold myself together to not drive her away. She deserves better. I have little time left with my best friend and dog, and I want to be able to truly send him off from this world with him knowing I'll be alright, as silly as that might sound. I want my parents to be proud of me, just like anyone would. I want to find the right career path. I love the life that's around me, and my mental fantasies aren't cutting it any more. They are a crutch, but I got two working legs. This is me, playing my full hand, baring my soul, pleading that I don't spiral into obscurity, that I don't need to resort to harming myself or delaying my pain with substances (other than the prescribed kind atleast). This is me admitting that I need help badly. Help me find the strength I need so that I can be the man the people in my life can depend on. Help me give a shit about my own self.",06Jun2019,3

I've been crying nonstop all day and I can't stop thinking about ways to kill myself. How do I stop this. How can I force myself to do things I hate without wanting to die? I don't understand how other people are capable of living like this. It's been so long since the last time I considered suicide and I thought I was getting better but apparently this is all it takes for it to come back. I've tried so many different types of antidepressants and nothing ever works. Talking to therapists never helped either. I really don't know what to do.... I can't even go back to school because studying had the same effect on me, I even attempted killing myself last semester so I dropped out.

86,"I've been in a less than ideal mental state for the last few years. During high school I was mostly meh about it because I didn't have to care about much, I just had to go to school and that was it. Every year was the same, every day pretty much the same. It was boring while I've always wanted adventure but at least it gave me less to worry about. It was only in the last year of high school that I even started noticing stuff I was missing out on. Never went to parties because I didn't like the idea, even though I never tried it. Had little friends and I didn't know how to approach people I wanted to be friends with. Again, I didn't even try. In the coming years I had to choose a bachelor's program that turned out to be not my thing, I took a year off school, and now I started again. But the existential dread never truly left me alone. I've gotten much better at being social by now but I still don't feel okay enough.

There are many things I don't like about who I am. I often feel separate from other people, like I'm not really the person they really want to hang with. I often keep to myself and stay pretty silent in conversations. People often say this about me in a way that it's just who I am, but I don't want to be that way. I find it hard to tell them that. Anyway, past summer some pretty crazy and exciting stuff happened, but it really made me realize just how much I was missing out on by isolating myself. I went to a doctor with the idea to finally get therapy, now with evidence that I might have social anxiety. It was also the prospect of winter coming again that drove me to this, as my winters have been rough the last three years. 

Anyway, I got referred to a generic mental health place, we call it 'basic mental healthcare.' They offer treatments for simple problems, and it's usually talk therapy that consists of 12 sessions max. I'm now at the end of this, with only one more session to go. I feel like I haven't been helped much. That's in part also on my end, because I failed to find enough motivation to do the things my therapist told me to try. It has certainly not been a waste because I've learned many things in the process but I don't feel much better. In fact, I may actually be feeling worse than last year. Last time I discussed this with her and she offered to refer me to what we call specialized mental healthcare. This is essentially therapy in the classic sense: an indefinite number of sessions that focus on more complex problems. She also thinks I might be suffering from a personality disorder, specifically avoidant. 

Here's the thing. I feel like it's way too much. Sure, I don't feel great all the time. But I can still find some enjoyment. I can still have contact with people, hang out *without* feeling unworthy, get my work done and live a pretty normal life. The existential dread, for lack of a better description, isn't always front and center. I can go whole periods of feeling pretty nice or even really great. It's just sometimes that I feel like shit but when I do it's really bad. In the winter it's often, in the summer it's sometimes. But mental breakdowns happen and they're still the same, if not worse, than three years ago. It hurts, they cause lack of sleep, increased anxiety, more isolation, lack of focus and concentration... I just feel like it's part of life and I should just deal with it, not go to therapy with a petty problem like this. I feel like I'm strongly exaggerating for idk, attention? I'm not doing it on purpose though, but it would make sense. I just want help figuring myself out, but I feel like I can't profit from insured healthcare for that. It's super hard to explain my dilemma about this, but it's only causing more stress for me. So much even that I sort of want therapy to help with this. It's super complicated for me even though it should be pretty simple... Is there anyone who can help me?",06Jun2019,1

I've battled with my mental health for as long as I can remember, probably from being age 13. My emotions were so volatile from one extreme to one other. I decided at one point that it wasn't healthy to feel like this because I was then left feeling burnt out so I seeked help. I went to my GP and told me not to worry it's just puberty.. inbetween that time and being 16 I was engaging in self destructive behaviour, self harming, drinking etc. Don't get me wrong I wasn't always feeling bad I felt great inbetween the rough times but what comes up must always come down and when I came down it hit me hard. I turned 18 and again I was at a point where I was struggling to keep myself together I was angry, irritable and highly anxious and others began to see this and make comments, someone had even put an anger management leaflet in my pigeon box at work. I was given sertraline and my dose gradually increased until I was taking 150mg. I didn't feel good but I didn't feel bad either I was just constantly in a daze. I was on them for two years and I'd gained alot of weight and lost my sex drive plus not even being able to achieve an orgasm without being at it for a very very long time (think friction burns lol). At 21 I started experiencing paranoia, I was being poisoned at work or my colleagues were attempting to poison me and that my phone was bugged by the government and they were tracking everything I was doing. This would persist for a few weeks, in those weeks I wouldn't sleep much and I was just a mess in general. In between then and now I've been up and down more times than a seesaw generally what I can only describe as volatile. I just about manage to keep my job and thankfully I think my employer and colleagues cut me some slack although I do understand it's probably becoming tedious. What's concerning me and what's pushed me to open up on here, I guess, is because I'm slowly heading down that self destruction route. Now a days its not drinking but its partaking in drugs, sexual encounters which in the right frame of my mind I wouldn't ever do these things. I like to think of myself as sensible. I'm not sleeping because my mind is racing so much, literally going through my entire day over and over again and songs just don't stop going round my head and I'm having extremely graphic instrusive thoughts. These thoughts consist of me stabbing myself on my thighs many times and slashing my self all over my body and then there's also the thought of beheading close ones to me and walking around with their heads in my hands. I would never in a million years even consider acting on these thoughts but they're there and they won't leave.. how do I make it all stop and feel normal again?",06Jun2019,1

91,"A little background: I am the oldest of 4: 2 step siblings and one biological. A year before my mom met my step-dad, my biological father had Lou Gehrig’s disease for 4 years. My mother took care of him with little to no human contact. She grew up in an abusive household with one alcoholic mother and a loving father (who enabled her Mother’s drinking). My mother and step father got divorced about 2 years ago. Their relationship was hot and cold for 8 years - especially the last 3 years. There was a lot of screaming, slamming, blaming, packing his clothes and such because of their different parenting styles. My step dad was apparently too hard on my brother (which i will admit, it was fairly hard. He raised my brother exactly how he was raised &amp; got to him at the age of 8 so it left a lasting impression on him) so she will never forgive him for the emotional abuse he put them through. The relationship ended on decent-ish terms, maybe a break at most (from what i was told) then my step dad bought a house 5 minutes from my mom. They refused to talk civilly and my step dad met a new woman with 3 kids who is also going through a nasty divorce. My mom is now sitting in our house constantly replaying the events she perceived, from manipulation to just ugliness for about 6 years. She also spent all her money on him (?). Through this 8 years I have constantly been vented to from both sides, and now that I’m in college, I keep fucking up I feel like. This is the time of my life where i feel it’s okay to make a few mistakes and she guilts me about not trying and always assumes the worst when it comes from me. My mother is now talking about how she’s been suicidal since I’ve been gone, how I’ve changed so much, how we aren’t twin flames, how she’s so broke, how she tries so hard but gets nothing in return. She has been in this house for a year and a half, stopped seeing her therapist, has no job, freaked out on my brother enough to where he sees her mental illness as her fault, and can be triggered at any second.

92,"I noticed that my entire life I’ve had this strange habit… When something bad happened or if my life was stressful, I’d so badly wish to go back in time. In retrospect, I realize this was my obsession. My compulsion is one of two things:

1.	Looking at the dates of old posts from Instagram, facebook, twitter etc. and wishing I could go back in time to them.
2.	Passing by places in town and wishing I could back in time to the last time I was in those places.

Very recently, I was diagnosed with OCD. My therapist says it’s mild. But it can feel really debilitating when I’m stressed.

Two years ago, I got a root canal. A year ago, another. I will spare you the details, but in the past year, I’ve had some fillings redone and they all feel sensitive. I also have two more teeth that might need root canals.

I’m a huge perfectionist. I feel like since my teeth can’t be perfect anymore, why bother…? Of course, the perfectionist in me keeps me going and I do keep up with my dental health by brushing twice daily, flossing once a day at night, and cutting out sugar. I am still stuck in the middle of all of my dental work. I still need to get work done, and my mouth is constantly aching from my teeth. Because of this, my wishful thinking has really taken over my life… All I can think about is life before my teeth gave me problems. All I can do is look back at old dates and wish I was back there. I tell myself what I would do differently. I tell myself if I could go back in time to that date and take better care of my teeth, I would be so happy presently. It is what I think about the moment I wake up. Some days are better than others. But some mornings I wake up crying and hopeless.

I literally don’t look forward to anything anymore. I consider doing anything a burden. It’s really scary as I’ve never felt like this in my life… Simple things I used to look forward to, like watching youtube videos after work or playing video games with friends or going out to dinner with my family, I just, don’t find joy in. I actually just sit and do nothing more often than not… Or I look up things about teeth online compulsively. That’s it.

I am seeing a therapist. She is wonderful. So smart and understanding. We are working on habituating my core fears: fear of not having a good life, fear of making mistakes. I do not know how I will be able to habituate my current thoughts and compulsions. Is there anyone else out there who’s had thoughts like these?

94,"(Warning: long rant)

When I was younger I’d deny there was ever anything wrong with me. By the end of middle school, after constantly hating myself and knowing everyone around me just wanted to make fun of me, I finally admitted to myself and one friend that I wasn’t okay. I just didn’t know what it was because I didn’t know about any disorders back then. I just told her that whenever I smile, it wasn’t from happiness, but instead to try to cope with whatever i was feeling. When I saw her face drop I should have realised talking about things like this just ruins people’s moods.

By high school I thought it would all magically improve now I was away from middle school but instead I was trying to run away from my problems and didn’t talk about it. Me and my friend both forgot about the previous conversation we had. Even though it looked like I was living a happy life, I was haunted by my experiences of school and bullying. I was terrified of interacting with most the people in my year who treated me badly but I would tell  myself it’s not bad and other people have much worse than I’ve ever experienced, so for a while I just felt ok. Then finally after a while when someone would do anything that reminded me of how I was treated my mind would catch up with me and I’d be flooded by my memories, sadness and anger. It’d repeat like this over and over.

By year 11 (15-16) my mind was severely affecting me. Even though I was surrounded by nice funny people and they’d make me so happy, some days I’d feel so down and hateful of myself, telling myself non of them ever liked me anyway, they’d leave me or never talk to me if my 2 true friends weren’t around. It was as though the happier people made me the more sad I got alone. Just walking past people in the corridors would stir so much anxiety in me. I was terrified they’d try to interact with me or say something about how ugly I was.

I had quite a few classmates with mental health problems, a friend with depression and a (not so) friend with a panic disorder. I opened up to one thinking they could understand me or help me out in the summer but by the next academic year they were ignoring me. I enjoyed the summer so much because even though my mind was the lowest it had been I felt like someone cared, but now I can hardly hold a conversation with them.

By now I can’t get anything done to do with focusing on work. I feel okay for a while, no real feelings, I mostly try to blank out most my surroundings but sometimes I feel very happy. However more recently as it comes to surface that I’ve got to get my life sorted and prepare for uni or an apprenticeship, I’ve been getting down and I just want to get drunk. I get angry and annoyed at simple things like trying to make the bed or not remembering something. But also the simplest things make me happy like a funny joke, good food or a nice day out. Then I get these random feelings of anxiety that I try to avoid at all costs. It annoys me how I feel about myself and how it’s constantly changing.

Sometimes I get scared that I’m going to end up with ocd as well because more and more often I’m finding the slightest things to bother me which I can’t explain. I know when something (or me) touches something dirty and it sticks in my mind with this kind of aura around it. Even months later when I come back to something, I remember that it touched something dirty even if I don’t remember what it is. I can’t sit on my bed with my day clothes on because I went outside in them and I hate when my hair touches my bed because it touched my coat that I wore on the bus. I didn’t like touching the dirty pans that I had to wash and put in the dishwasher and immediately had to wash my hands. I also hate touching coins or leaning my elbows on tables in public.

For a while after I read through some disorders back in high school I thought I had bpd because of how often my state of mind would change, however most the time I’d just feel numb. I get up, carry through my routine, eat, sleep. I’m scared of showing my feelings after opening up so I’ve only cried 3 times this year, and hate myself for doing so. I want to be able to just appear to be emotionally strong and confident. After the third time I realised how much I’ve been neglecting my feelings but I don’t know what’s wrong and I can’t get help because I know no one would ever listen and truly care. ‘Clinical psychologists just do it for the money anyway right?’. I can’t even bring myself to talk to my friends or family either.

I just want to be able to carry on my life and be able to get up, shower daily and do my work like I’m supposed to. I want to make friends and be able to talk to the people who are (I guess) friends with me. I always fumble over my words when talking to others and cringe when I remember what I said to people during the day. I want to be confident and carefree, feel secure in making new friends without alcohol by my side. I want to tell my parents and friends that somethings not right with me but at the same time I don’t even know what or if there’s anything wrong with me. What if they think I’m overreacting or don’t care or I scare them. Im scared that I’ll never be cared for by anyone and the people I like will leave me. 

I don’t want people to pity me like all the others did when I told them, and I don’t want to cry in front of anyone anymore, so I’m saying this all here. I just want to meet people who feel the same and understand me for who I am so we can talk as equals, not as if I’m being talked down to, being pitied or scrutinised, and mostly I wish I knew what was wrong with me.",06Jun2019,1
95," Crosspost from r/mentalillness, since this is a bigger sub and I might get and answer :)   


My therapist thinks I have some compulsive tendencies, but we have yet to be able to look into it. So I would love some input if others live with something similar what their experiences are.

I have AvPD (anxious avoidant personality disorder), some depression, and rather severe anxiety. Basically it's a puzzle that is hard to figure out.

What my therapist knows of is that I need to sit down in complete silence, or do certain things (like listening to a specific song on youtube) before I can do something else, like going to the toilet or make food. Not all the time, but at least a few times a week. I also get some overwhelming feeling of dread, and walk in circles or bite my hand (gently) for it to stop. She knows of the circles, but not the biting. I am also thinking that someone is spying on me with hidden or hacked cameras, or looking into my windows when I sleep (my logical part knows that is not true, but it still bothers me/I still take steps to avoid it)

What I have not told her, is that easily 10-15 times a day I remember something and instantly respond by saying a negative thing about myself. It's not even terrible memories, but something slightly embarrassing and I'll whisper/say/yell ""fucking idiot""/just go away, fucking whore/just die. Etc to myself, I do not plan them, but I am able to control it a bit when with other people as I am very focused on them not hearing me. (I do occasionally slip up if I zone out though)

It's embarrassing, and I hate that I do it, but I can't stop, and I've done it since I was probably 15 or so (28 now).

I also have thoughts where I am sure I am into kids, or animals, which is absurd as I am asexual. But my brain say that I am just thinking I am ace because I haven't tried it yet (which I refuse to try). My brain also said I think I am ace because I haven't tried a specific kink, or a certain setting etc, but having done pretty much all that is legal and morally ok, and hated all of it, I am 100% that I am not going to change no matter what I try, and even if it turns out I am into kids or animals, then why would I want to find out when I am happily content as an ace.

Reason why we have not worked on it yet is because my Avpd have been the focus, and I am improving. Just realized last year that people actually love each other and it's not all play pretend, so that was an eye-opener lol.

I am also convinced I am lying about my own health? That I am saying things that aren't true and over-exaggurating just to get attention kinda, but I also know that isn't true

Basically, I want to be able to talk about it to my therapist, and for her to understand the whole picture, but as of now I am confused as to what is real and worth talking about, what is ""normal"" for everyone. And to know I am not 100% alone.",06Jun2019,1
97,"I' currently struggling with depression and feel trapped and alone. When I try to discuss it with any else they worry for me, which makes me feel like nothing but a burden. I recently got an idea, but need confirmation if it is the right thing to do. My idea is to use a Tumblr blog as a depression journal. Everyday I would document how I did. I could finally talk about my depression without forcing the burden on other people, or at least that's what I hope. I know I need help but I refuse to if it hurts others.",06Jun2019,4
98,"Hi everyone, I just wanted to know what causes this to happen. I used to have a big 'phobia' of falling asleep 'cause I was scared I would die in my sleep. I past that one now. A few months ago I had severe anxiety that I was gonna get killed and I had that bad sense of impending doom and my chest hurt. A few weeks ago at work I had to call the police for something but the phone didn't work, but it ended up getting through, then the people who were causing a fight ended up leaving and we didn't need the police no more and they had rang the store and I told team the story. I don't think they minded but I was anxious af. I thought OMG I called them for nothing now I'm gonna get arrested, since then I have had intense paranoia of being arrested for absoloutely no reason. I know it sounds silly but I get extremely stressed, my chest was hurting before. I don't know what causes me to have such an intense paranoia over things that aren't even a problem, my brain just makes it up and believes it and stresses me out. Every day I am on the verge of shaking. Once I get over this stupid thing it will be something else. It's like I am constantly stressed and there isn't a relief. 

Does anyone know what this is called? Is it just anxiety? How to calm it please, I see my Dr in 3 weeks Idk how to cope until then lol",06Jun2019,1
99,"Since I was about primary school age, I've mimicked the people around me in an attempt to fit in. It's not necessarily me faking who I am, but it's me showing select traits and mannerisms to different groups of people. I've basically always observed different people and then acted in a way that I thought they'd find acceptable. Along with this, I've always been a bit of a lonely soul. I've had friends on and off, but I always felt a sense of loneliness..in what I think was/is a way for me to deal with this, I've had the tendency to become overly attached to fictional worlds and characters..I've had hyper fixations all my life.   


That's just some context. I've been struggling with my mental health since I was about 13. It's been on and off, I've had good years during that time. I have never been diagnosed with anything, but I am starting to think that there is something wrong with me. Since late 2017, my mind has felt foggy..yet again, this fluctuates in severity, but overall I have felt a detachment from myself. When I try to explain it to those close to me, I describe it as my brain floating outside of my body high in the clouds..attached to my head by a piece of ribbon. I am easily agitated, I experience mood swings, I lash out, and I self sabotage. I have a boyfriend and I'm overly suspicious and not very trusting of him..even though he has done nothing to deserve those feelings. If I argue with him over the internet, I sometimes feel quite detached from the argument and I will say things that I don't truly mean and I won't think about the consequences.   


Anyways, I have finally decided to go to the doctors and seek some help (this weekend hopefully). This is where the first paragraph comes in..I feel like any mental disorders that I research or are bought up to me, I find myself relating to. But I feel like that could just be due to my ""chameleon"" traits. I don't trust my own judgement on the situation, I don't trust that I am not making things up or at least exaggerating them.   


I just want to know if anyone can relate or give me some comfort..I'm starting to feel kind of crazy. I hate myself for the things that I do but it's almost as if I zone out and do them without thinking. I'm not saying I'm not in control, I take full responsibility..but it's like I don't realise that this is all real and there are consequences. I can't act like this with no repercussions.",06Jun2019,2
100,"So I don't know where to start from, but anyway, I'm 22 and I've been having the following:

- Social Anxiety (even phone calls leave me tired afterwards)

- Extreme tiredness (lethargy) (Adderall Improved it)

- Crappy short-term memory (worsens if I'm doing something boring like work) (nothing improves this for some reason)

- I don't like to socialize or going out, it kind of feels like a waste of time since I don't enjoy it (sincerely) even when drunk

- Fear of making important decisions (like moving from an expensive apartment to cheap one just because of the work it will take)

- I'm 100% disorganized but I usually throw stuff away (Adderall Improved it)

- I day dream a fuck ton(Adderall didn't remove this)

- I wake up in the morning and get so angry (no reason), I usually punch stuff (yes that crazy angry, I feel shame, but I feel like a rabid dog, can't control it)

 This has been affecting me my whole life but only 1 year ago I went to the doctor because it really started to affect me since I was living by myself and taking care of myself, my doctor diagnosed me with ADHD, I took Adderall but it only made me want to move physically and do things but I still had social anxiety, the fear of making important decisions, and crappy memory, my doctor upped the dose and all but it just scaled the effects (I was on it for a month), then I tried phenibut, it helped with the social anxiety but I still felt anxiety of doing things, tried xanax too

So you might be thinking depression right? well,I don't feel extreme low levels of confidence, it's pretty normal, I worked on that on my teen years and it's way better, I'm on keto diet, and it eased the social anxiety a bit but that's all it did. 

Things I did to improve it (but only helped slightly)

- Exercise (note: I feel extremely tired afterwards but kind of good (brain), but still tired)

- I take magnesium citrate, sodium(salt), potassium, and a centrum all-nutrients supplement

- I sleep at 10PM and wake up at 7AM (I tried sleeping more but I get even more fatigued)

- I eat healthy, and keep it very keto, MCT oils, avocado, salads, beef, chicken. 

Note: I found out that sugar (especially refined makes me way more anxious and I get dandruff like crazy even on my face which I have had my whole life and keto really got rid of it)

I also didn't drink caffeine growing up (but still had all those issues) but now I take it so it gives me an extra oomph, but far from motivating, I tried so many things but the problem now is that these issues took a toll on my job and now I have a shittier job and no insurance, I tried all types of rhodiola-ashwaghanda-[insert your nootropic here] but they are either really subtle or don't even work altogether(btw I took them for at least a week before giving up on them).

TL;DR: So my question is, what steps should I take in this situation? should I go get blood work or should I see a psychiatrist? problem is, I'm poor but I can't apply for medicaid, what options do I have? 

By the way, I'm sorry for it being a long post, and quite all over the place, that's kind of how my brain works",06Jun2019,1

104,"My(f16) best friend (m16) has been suffering with depression for a while and although he seemed to be getting better yesterday he said something that really worried me. 

I went to our school counselor and reported it. I’d rather him hate me and be alive then dead.

But today he won’t look at me. Won’t speak to me. I can’t say I didn’t expect it but it still hurts. I love him with all my heart and I couldn’t know what was happening.

I wrote a letter the school counselor will give him and knew I should just wait.

But I couldn’t. I saw him and messaged a mutual friend of ours. I just asked if my best friend was alright. I should have kept my mouth shut but I was too worried.

My best friend saw the text and bought on. He apparently dismissed himself to the restroom. 

I’m worried he’s not in the restroom. I’m worried I pissed him of and he ran of somewhere. I’m scared. I went to the office, I’m headed home because I know I’m only going to cause problems at the school.

I told the office I didn’t know where he was. I don’t know what’s going to happen. I don’t want to message our friend to check on him again. I can’t message my best friend and I KNOW that won’t do anything good. I know I need to leave it alone. Let it go, it’s out of my hands.

But I’m so scared. He might hate me now but I still love him. I don’t know what to do.

TLDR: I reported my best friend because I was worried about his mental/physical health, he won’t look at me and he’s told a friend of ours he’s gone to the bathroom but I don’t think he’s there. Should I do nothing? I don’t want to make things worse.",06Jun2019,1

110,"So, I missed a year of school a few years back due to anxiety and depression. I am now back in school and am disgusted with my parents. 

An IEP which I have not used once has been put in place for me. The teachers treat me differently and so do my peers. My mother requested that the bus stop be closer to the house, as well, so everyone on my bus sees my differently. My parents hold meetings with my teachers/counselors, yet never tell me what has been said. They email my teachers each week, asking for my progress. They refuse to get rid of the IEP, and even my counselor tried to encourage them it was for the best. The IEP has not benefited me whatsoever, as my anxiety or depression does not affect my schoolwork. If anything the IEP makes my social anxiety worse, as I’m fearful of what others will think. My parents refuse to let me see a psychiatrist or therapist, as they believe the underlying issue is Lyme disease. My mother has some deep-rooted psychological issues, as she constantly confides in our family, complaining about her coworkers. She has been unable to keep a job for more than a year, and is constantly applying for jobs. I believe she is mentally unstable, as she goes out of her way to insult members in our family, for no reason, and continues to do so, until they reach a breaking point. My father is emotionally absent and has been my whole life. He goes along with anything my mother says or does. He has no opinions of his own.

I started freaking out over it yesterday because I was supposed to be working, and I had a panic attack. Long story short, I dragged myself to the doctor, they gave me a Diazepam, but when I tried to explain to the doctor that the panic attack was a separate issue, and the other symptoms were related to the alcohol incident, he wasn’t having any of it. He just said it was all caused by anxiety and I should see a psychiatrist. To me, that sounded like “I don’t know what’s going on with this guy, but I can’t be dealing with him, so I’m getting him to go away.”

I’m getting pretty desperate at this point. I just want this to stop. I don’t know what to do. I could go back to the doctor, but what am I going to say? “You’re wrong and I demand another diagnosis?” I’m not sure the symptoms I’m experiencing are anxiety-related, but they sure are stressing the fuck out of me and I narrowly avoided having another panic attack this afternoon.

By 2013 my mom had went through heart surgery to get this machine which was basically her life. If she didn’t mix her medicine for the machine could pump the medicine to her heart she would die in minutes and I remember my mom used to cry and be sad because she used to say that she wanted to be normal and not want to live anymore. As months went on I was in the 8th grade already and in that school to play volleyball, football, and basketball you had to ask the P.E. teacher to get the ball you wanted and I had went to play basketball and at the school so during that day there was a substitute teacher and I had ask the sub if I can get a basketball and instead of telling me if I could get the basketball the substitute told me I sucked at basketball, I was the worse basketball player, and that I should never play basketball again which really hurt my confidence playing basketball and made me think still to this day that I am horrible at basketball. Then in 2013 my freshmen year of high school my mom had went to the hospital in Santa Barbara and at 2:15pm I had seen my mom laying down in her hospital bed in a seriously bad condition and seconds later the machines in the room start going off and doctors start rushing in because my mom was dying and next thing you know it I had seen my mom passed away in front of my very own eyes. After that I didn’t go to school and I was failing bad in school like bad. I didn’t want to do anything I just wanted to be in my room. I was super depressed. I didn’t eat or do anything. Then a few months later after my mother passed I had experienced my first anxiety attack I was very scared and thought I was going to die. Then 2 years later in 2015 my junior of high school I had asked out this girl I really liked and everything went good, me and her had a great relationship and I wasn’t really experiencing any anxiety. But then my dad all of sudden kicked me out of the house because he turned into a major alcoholic after my mom passed away so I asked my girlfriend if I can move in with her family which is a pretty big situation. They said yes I could move in with them and I live there for about 3 years which is basically all of my high school experience and I hadn’t experienced any anxiety living with them not once and after high school I attended my local community college and me and girlfriend still had a very healthy relationship just some arguments about college. Then one day I had went to her the mall with her and her family and I had seen her phone while she was trying on shoes that another guy was texting and the text said “I love you to babe” and i told her that very moment that is that real and she just laughed and tried deleting the message and I just left the mall crying. So I had then had to move in my grandma’s oblivious I couldn’t still live there after what had happened. So when I moved into my grandma’s house it was okay then about 6 months ago I had one of the biggest anxiety attacks ever. Late at night like around I was awake at 3am my stomach hurt, my face went numb, and I felt “shaky” so I thought I was having a stroke so I was scaring myself bad my heart was racing and I was very scared and nervous. I never like going to the hospital because after what happened to my mom. So I stuck it through but ever since I haven’t been myself or good at all. Literally I have anxiety attacks more often now. I have pain in my body that travels. I feel chest pain like around my pecks, sometimes I feel like my eyes go blurry, also I feel like just falling down like light headedness, also the feeling of throwing up and sometimes even throwing up, loosing my appetite, along with a slight cough with mucus that doesn’t want to leave the back of my throat, and having diarrhea, and also I feel like there is this sudden drop in heart it’s like this weird feeling that feels scary. After all of that I immediately went to the Emergency room and told them how I was feeling and so they did a EKG on me and they said I had a perfect heart and so they then did took blood from me and the result were perfect all they said it was Heart Palpitations. So they then prescribed me Xanax. I took them and I felt normal and I haven’t took them in about week already but I do feel like the something is wrong with me still and that something is wrong with my heart. Even though Emergency room lab test are accurate so nothing is wrong with me. I don’t know the reason why my anxiety got this bad. If it’s because of what I went through I just don’t know. My anxiety is causing my mental health to go severely bad. Also with every I look up it just scares me even more because I am absolutely scared of dying. I just wanted to ask what is your story? Thank you for for listening appreciate it.",06Jun2019,1

132,"TRIGGER WARNING: eating disorder, self-harm, suicidal ideation (not mine)

&amp;#x200B;

I have a sister whose response to our (mostly) shared trauma, depression, and anxiety was the opposite of mine: I turned to food and social outings for comfort, she turned to cutting and restricting her diet (among other things) therefore developing anorexia nervosa. My overeating only just grazed the binge eating disorder criteria (feeling out of control when consuming what I would consider large volumes of food), whereas my sister has voluntarily admitted herself into treatment for her ED, anxiety, and depression nearly ten times in the last three years.

As you can imagine, weight loss and restriction are EXTREMELY touchy subjects in my family. Not only have members of my family suffered PTSD symptoms from the situations they've been in surrounding my sister, they are scared as all get-out to discuss nutrition/weight-loss/health/whatever else in regard to one's body.

Where you guys come in: how do I help educate my family in showing them that my making efforts to lose weight is indeed a good thing? When I bring it up, I'm shut down immediately and told that what is and isn't healthy is entirely debatable. 

And because I feel like it needs to be said: 1. the weight-loss is indeed necessary as I am experiencing the negative side effects of being 50 lbs over the healthy weight range for my height and age. And 2. I don't EVER discuss this with or in front of my sister, for obvious reasons. It's just that other family members' understanding would be nice to have.

Has anyone else gone through something like this? What did you do/say? I've kept my current weight loss basically a secret (easily kept as the 20 lbs haven't made a huge difference yet but it will obviously begin to show with the more I lose), but I want to be proud of taking care of my body and mind and feel like I just can't be when someone in my family is hurting due to their relationship with their body, control, food, etc. 

Please be gentle if you decide to respond. TIA!",06Jun2019,5

134,"There's this on-going idea - primarily espoused by people who seek to abuse others - that depression clouds your mind. If you feel hated and alone, it must mean you're not hated and alone.

&amp;#x200B;

That's straight-up bullshit. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE FOR THIS. No one has ever proved depression is somehow involved with irrationality. Just because you feel something, doesn't mean it's necessarily untrue. I feel ugly, but it's not just that I feel ugly but I AM ugly. It is a part of my being. So is my loneliness. I am utterly alone. It's not a feeling, it's a way of being.

Once you realize these things are part of your reality, not just 'feelings', you can start to work on them. If you feel alone, and people tell you you're not alone, THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO KEEP YOU ALONE. I was astonished how it's always those who seeks to de-stigmatize mental health end up enforcing such a rough stigma.",06Jun2019,0

136,"Hi there. I have recurring severe depression, anxiety, and other things. In the past few days I've been dipping into depression, and as with the past few episodes I've had, I'm getting weird urges to do stuff like drive out of town and just drive, or walk as far as I possibly can, or stand outside in the rain (it's winter here), stay awake all night, etc, and this quickly turns into self-destructive urges. I'm looking for suggestions of any kind of activities I could do that would have a slightly similar effect. I'm in recovery from an ED, addiction and self harm, so I can't go and exercise for a ridiculously long time etc. The only thing I've thought of is having a cold shower, because that's like an unexpected rush. I have cut my hair a few times but right now there isn't much to cut. Have got some piercings and don't have money to get more right now. I don't know, just need some way to channel the impulses that aren't as pedestrian as journalling or drawing or whatever.

137,"You are correct. Women are more emotional and NEUROTIC than men,

&amp;#x200B;

As a whole women do score higher on trait neuroticism in the Big 5 Personality traits, a test that is used by many in the mental health field to assess individuals personalities. 

&amp;#x200B;

Neuroticism being the person's emotional reactivity to negative (or perceived negative) life events.

&amp;#x200B;

When compared to men, women on average score higher on neuroticism. This means when they experience an event that is negative or could be negative the majority of women will find it more emotionally triggering than the majority of men. I emphasize majority because not all women are high in trait neuroticism and some men ARE high in trait neuroticism.

&amp;#x200B;

So when a woman hurt, let's say ghosted after a date, it is in her DNA, her gender, her very personality to react stronger than the average man would. She might agonize what she could have done differently, feel crushed at his rejection, react with obsessively reaching out to him to try to fix what went wrong, or a host of other behaviors one commits when in pain.

&amp;#x200B;

An man very low in neuroticism might not even notice that he is being ghosted and he just thinks, ""huh, I wonder what happened to her.""  This isn't all men and all women, this is what is statistically normal.

&amp;#x200B;

Hence men being generally confused, frustrated, alarmed, or any other emotion they get when the women reacts more than the would. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just because it is different than how we would react doesn't make it irrational. It is hard to relate to people who are different in neuroticism than we are and no wonder, how can you understand something if you've never been through it.

&amp;#x200B;

Try to think about a time when you felt hurt by someone. Really hurt by someone. A time when you were genuinely betrayed, insulted, rejected, or abandoned. First the initial shock that left you breathless, your chest unable to move let alone suck in air, the anger that burned its way up your chest, threatening to choke you in heat, and the emptiness in your chest from the loss momentary or permanent disconnection with the person who hurt you.  

&amp;#x200B;

What causes these emotions in people depends on personal triggers (people have their different proclivities) and personality traits.

&amp;#x200B;

So the point of all this is that women are labeled as crazy simply because they react more strongly to negative emotions than others. If we all understand that this is not insanity, it is their physiological make up causing their nervous system to be sensitive to the negative events around them. Which is great in times when they are caring for others, sensitivity to the pain, anger, frustration, depression, etc. They make great caretakers for infants who cannot tell you when they are hurting, hungry, scared, or angry. You definitely want someone who will react strongly, and immediately to the negative events around them.

&amp;#x200B;

In dating, especially, it becomes a point of disconnect. You often hear men calling women crazy for various reasons and perhaps there is no reason a woman gets called crazy as much as when she gets upset over something he perceives as minor. 

&amp;#x200B;

The way to bridge the gap would ideally come from self-awareness from both sides. First women, realize that it is likely that you score high in neuroticism and are likely to perceive things to be worse than they are. Meditation, exercise, journalling, therapy, medication are all ways of dealing with it. Talk to your partner and calmly explain what you are feeling, what caused you to feel it, and what will help you feel better. 

&amp;#x200B;

And men if you are confused by women who react in ways that you think are exaggerated, she is likely feeling what you would feel times ten. Realize that as a man you are in general both less inflicted and able to feel negative emotions. Which might be a blessing, but it does leave the majority of men scratching their head as to why women get so worked up over certain things. Talk to your partner and explain what YOU are feeling, what is your perception of the event, and what will make YOU feel better.

&amp;#x200B;

This is written by a psychology student. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR  According to psychologists the majority of women react stronger to negative events than men and it isn't because they are crazy.",06Jun2019,0

140,"So I'll try to sum up the story, basically almost a month ago my dad had an argument with the neighbors across the street, a few hours afterward the neighbor he was fighting with shot a BB gun towards him (didn't hit him and police were called, but didn't do much) and ever since then I could see he wasn't the same guy 

After a while he started acting strange, he got paranoid that they were plotting to hurt him or something, even as far as ""spying and bugging"" the house and phone (not true at all) he has made so many lies up and so many stories about these people and about everyone else, I couldn't even go into full detail because there is so much to cover

Anyways, hes been, talking to himself, talking to us in really quiet tones, locking and closing every window and door in the house, takes us on ""rides"" so that he can't be ""followed"" and overall just completely ignoring his actual life and financial situation (not very good btw) 

I already know nothing's true of what he said, but he refused to listen to reason anymore, and has just become a very paranoid and disturbed person. I just need to pinpoint what he's going through and how I can help. If anyone can assist I will be glad to provide some more clear details. 

Thanks.",06Jun2019,1
141,"Been on the journey to a healthier state of mind for the entirety of my adult life, which began 6 years ago. I have seen therapists, psychiatrists and the like on and off for years, getting prescriptions then falling off of prescriptions, getting back on them just to stop taking them all together and feeling completely untrusting of the entire process.

I told myself I didn’t want to take my SSRIs anymore and wrote off my former psychiatrist once I moved back to my home town. I began seeing my therapist again and after some new revelations, have been on a two month hunt for a new psych for some testing to be done. That process has been an extremely frustrating one, and the idea of the time and financial investment into ruling in/out this possible diagnosis already is a huge burden to me. I’ve been calling places around me and they do not make me feel any better about the process as a whole and now I’m left defeated. I’m set for the time being on not reaching out to any psychs or anyone that could help me because the process of it all sucks for those who need help. I feel like they all make it so much harder than it needs to be....

Which brings me to now. I’ve spent the majority of my day in bed, debating whether or not to go get a huge bottle of wine and drink it all tonight in an effort to feel not so fucking bored of the time I spend awake. I’ve asked myself that question so often recently and after a brief hiatus from drinking and smoking, I started up again and I definitely don’t feel anything either way. I don’t want to buy the wine because I know I can’t afford it and it’s not necessary but life is so damn dull that I cannot stand to be awake/present for any of it. 

So instead of wine, I will OD on melatonin tablets and go to sleep for the next 16 hours. Nothing gets as close to happiness for me as sleep does.",06Jun2019,1
142,"Hey everyone, 

Does anyone have any experience with meds and weight gain? When I stop taking a med that's causing weight gain, will I automatically lose the weight, or will I have to diet to return to my previous weight?

Long story short, I just went to the doctor for a yearly check-up and found out that over 8 months, I gained about 40 pounds. I've never been prone to gaining much weight and I eat healthily, so the doctors have chalked it up to a drug called Abilify, an anti-psychotic medicine that I'm taking. One of the known side effects is weight gain, with a study finding children (I just turned 18) gained 1 pound per week, sometimes more.

Anyways, I'm really done with this. I'm a pretty active person, and I hate the idea that I'm just randomly gaining weight with no control over it. I'm going to get off the med in about a week, which I'm pumped about. Any answers to this question would be much appreciated.

Also, just something that I feel like I need to say: I understand that everyone of all different weights can be healthy and active, and different people have different weights that are right for them. For me personally, though, gaining 40 pounds in a span of 8 months is not normal, and I feel healthier and more like myself at my previous weight.

Thanks in advance!",06Jun2019,1
143,"I started taking zoloft when I was 15 years old because I had social anxiety and would avoid trying to make friends or talk to people because I felt like I was annoying them. I’m now 22 years old and I don’t feel that way anymore but I do feel like I’ve lost all my emotions completely. I’ve stayed on the zoloft because it feels better than how I felt before and I have a much better social life now.

But I don’t feel anything. I’ve never really dated because I just don’t really have feelings for people. When something bad happens I don’t get upset I just joke about it (if it was something really serious I would be upset). When something bad happens to other people I don’t feel anything for them. I do my best to make the situation better because I still have morals, ya know.

I’m just not very motivated and I don’t really feel emotions. I don’t feel sad or anything. Is it possible the zoloft is muting my emotions? I’m afraid to go off it because I’m afraid it will go back to what it was like before. My psychiatrist suggested I might have avoidant personality disorder. I told him that I don’t have feelings and he was pretty much like “pssh yeah you do you just don’t express them” but I genuinely just... don’t feel.

Of course, there's my current DnD group, but I don't feel very connected with them.

Honestly I guess DnD doesn't do much for that usually. All they do is talk about their characters and stuff. They're not like my old group.

I just want to feel comfortable and accepted, but I don't even feel like I care when people talk to me. I don't care about most conversations. U feel like I'm just trying to be social and then nothing happens.

I know I've brought this separation upon myself.

I've also been experiencing a lot more anxiety than usual. In class i'll constantly start to shake a little, and almost cry over the smallest things that pop into my mind.  I also experience thoughts of self harm multiple times a day. My family has a long history of mental illness. My father has BPD, and my great grandmother was in a mental hospital for long periods of time. I've researched the illness a bunch, and found it can be hereditary, and noticed that I experience some of the symptoms. These include outbursts of anger (although I never express it outwardly, just try to bottle it up until it goes away), quick changes in mood, impulsiveness, and that big ol' feeling of emptiness . I live with my mom, who I am very afraid to open up to. From what I understand, she divorced my father because she couldn't handle his BPD. All the times I've tried to open up to her in the past, she brushes it off as PMS.

At a certain point I was so tired, scared and extremely unsure of myself that I just spilled all my insecurities to whoever was listening. i didn’t even notice myself doing it.. After one too many mental breakdowns after going out, I decided I needed to stop and seek a shrink. 

Just like that I stopped going out, doing drugs and even drinking alcohol. I’m also seeing a shrink now after waiting for 6 weeks. Which I am super relieved about. 

But now, I see all my old colleagues posting mental health stuff, the club posted a picture of me (the meaning is nice) etc.. like.. ? Awkward. And worse, there is even someone who now for the third time is posting a selfie with mean description referred to me. (Only I see that it’s obviously about me)

I Just don’t know how to deal. It makes me more insecure about how I have acted when I was clearly not doing well.
