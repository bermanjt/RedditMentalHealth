0,"Throwaway account because I don't regularly use reddit anyway. Also this could be the wrong place to post this, please let me know if it is and I'll remove this post.

I've been to therapy, it didn't work out and I don't have the resources to go back.

Life is going poorly, been depressed and on antidepressants for years, nothing has worked so far, have attempted suicide in the past, yadda yadda yadda.

I'm so far at the end of my rope that I'm turning to the internet for any form of guidance.

Basically, I'm a senior in an American high school, and I have no friends and have had no friends since 7th grade. I have however had a girlfriend for the past 9 months, but she has started ignoring me and spending time with only her friends, basic high school romance stuff. I haven't actually seen her for more than a few minutes a day in about three weeks. Anyhow, this has really taken a huge toll on my mental health as we grow more distant, especially as it coincides with my being taken off of antidepressants (trintellix was only the most recent in a lot of meds). But, this isn't a relationship advice post, theres nothing that will save my relationship anyhow; we've tried talking about it but she just ignores me and doesn't want to talk about it. 

I've been getting home and crying for hours, except now I think I'm having a full psychotic breakdown. Every time I cry I transition between  laughing hysterically and sobbing, and I keep talking to myself just to have something to distract from my life crumbling and no one to talk to. Iv'e been hitting myself with my fists too almost to the point of actually giving myself a concussion; it helps distract me. I think I've been doing all of this recently maybe as a result of antidepressant withdrawal, and as it happens I've been conscious that I'm trying to subdue my emotions and gain control over myself. Honestly, I don't know what's wrong with me.

I guess I just wanted to vent. If anyone ever sees this, I'll answer comments if anyone has advice or similar experiences.",28Sep2019,1
1,"In my 30s and have been working on unpacking my mental health issues for many years. My current doctor referred me to a specialist to be assessed for mood disorders. 

The initial appointment is over $200, due at the time of the appointment. This may be nothing to some, but I live paycheck to paycheck and very modestly. The appointment would mean skipping another bill. 

I'm now faced with the choice of budgeting differently to afford one appointment that may or may not give me more answers, or to continue with how I am now - high functioning, but not necessarily healthy. 

Why is this a decision that even has to be made? I have pretty good insurance through my job and I just don't see how I can afford to care for myself properly.",28Sep2019,1
2,"I just want it all to end. I’ve been through a LOT and still am going through it. It’s nearly been 9years since it all started. I’ve had counselling sessions for it CBT for it etc. I had PTSD. I live under the same conditions of my ptsd and there’s no way I can escape it either, because I’m not self sufficient yet. I wallow in my own depression, sometimes unable to get up from my bed to even clean myself or eat or go to the toilet. I have no more will to live any more. I push them away in hopes of not getting hurt again but them accepting and pulling back hurts even more. Them and they being my family. They were the cause and are still the stimuli...how do you get away from the people you still care about. Like small things around the house still remind me. The way they speak or say things to me remind me. My parents can say some of the most hurtful things too and try to apologise after. Like I used to accept their apology but these apologies no longer hold weight because it’s a reoccurring thing now. I can’t even afford to live by myself yet like I am capable of earning money but it’s too expensive to live out. I go uni but my student finance doesn’t even cover my rent let alone help me live. I tried getting a job near uni only to be rejected. On top of this all I have come to dislike men so working with them makes me really uncomfortable. There are several reasons for this dislike too. I don’t think this pain will ever end and I don’t know how to efficiently end it without causing trouble for others. I need help. I really really need help. Why do people give birth to life when they can’t look after it. I can only sit and cry in my room. I have uni to go to tomorrow but I don’t even have the energy to pack for it or even know how I’ll take myself there. For a fact I know I won’t concentrate on uni for a while. Then there’s my rent issue too. Asking for money from my parents further makes them belittle me because I’m using their money to live. I always feel like I’m begging them for it. I feel ashamed. I’ve been at home for 3 months but I earned my own money to feed myself. Only using the water and the bathroom and my room. I don’t turn on the lights to minimise my spending too. Because they provide it for me. I’ve always felt like an outsider and I’m slowly becoming an outsider as I grow up. I have barely any friends and no family I can rely on. I barely have friends because I’m not allowed to socialise. I think I might as well soon because I can’t take the emotional guilt tripping from them either. When I tell them how I feel and how they make me feel they emotionally guilt trip me. Like for example today my mum ate a lot of sugar which made her blood sugar level increase. She’s diabetic. Because I told her (well screamed) that they make me feel shit and I can no longer even eat the food at home. And asked them why they even gave birth to me to make me feel this way. To be honest she even told me she wished she’s never birthed me. Then apologised after saying she said it in anger. But this was the second time she said it. And always on my birthdays too. I actually don’t have the will anymore",28Sep2019,1
3,Ok so I turned 40 yesterday :) but have been single for 10 years. I'm really not quite sure why I'm fit own a profitably business and have a good sense of humour. Maybe it's because I have complete ease when taking to woman but that's it never anything more. Feel like crap :(,28Sep2019,2
4,I met this person a while ago i was kinda scared to talk to them because i’m not very good at making friends but after a while they conversation just flowed. no awkward small talk no forced conversations just everything flowed and still does flow good! it’s been about 2 months into the friendship and we have so many similar interests and the same type of humor. i haven’t had a good friend like this in a while who has been there for me through everything including my stupid rants and supported me even if they didn’t agree with me. They also will either try to talk to me or take my mind of stuff when i’m feeling like nothing is going right. i just am really happy to have found a friend like this because i think they’re pretty rare to come by.,28Sep2019,4
5,If anyone would be willing to just hear me out about all the problems I'm facing and hopefully just try and calm me down or give me some hope and advice I really need it because I really feel I am going crazy with everything I'm facing.,28Sep2019,1
6,"Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

I have recently realized that it is time for me to start talking to a therapist/mental health professional.  Below has a little more detail but it's also a bit of a negative rant so the TL:DR is first.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR

How did you find your therapist and do you have any advice for someone looking?

&amp;#x200B;

Rant:

&amp;#x200B;

I have recently started looking for a therapist and I'm concerned about what I've seen.  To give some context I am roughly 30 years old and I've recently come to the understanding that most of my life I have been coping and suppressing, I have not really been processing.  I believe there is a strong disconnect between who I perceive myself to be and who I am in practice and everyday life. I want to understand more about those thoughts and here is my rant.

&amp;#x200B;

When I started looking for a therapist I used what I believe the majority of people would do initially, I searched online.  I used a search engine for ""Therapists in 'my location'"" and the first 4 things that came up were ads. The ads were for Therapists in my area so they were not completely unrelated, but why monetize mental health? Every day people make the decision to better themselves and to find help and why should I trust someone more because they are the highest bidder? Fuck that noise. Oh and since the mental health industry is now a profit industry there are countless other blogs and review sites which use the same monetary highest bidder = higher result model of business. Sometimes making the decision that you are not completely in control and you need help is not an easy realization.  If you capitalize on people who are in a vulnerable state, just fuck you.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm asking how can someone find a professional that you can trust?",28Sep2019,1
7,"I have finally decided that the best for me and my health would be to finally go to see a specialist. Still, Im beyond nervous about it and have no idea what to expect or how to prepare for it.

9,"I dont know if this belongs here but I need help. I'm a dude, 19 if that matters. And I am in a relationship and we have been together for about 4 months now. Before this I was in a relationship for almost 2 years. After the last relationship and this relationship I know I have a lot of problems but dont know how to change them. I can get controlling. Like she'll say something about hanging out with some friends and I'll get mad and not want her to for no reason. Shes going to homecoming tomorrow and I'm not because their not my thing but I cant seem to be okay with her going. I just have this constant idea in my mind that shes gonna cheat or do something I wouldn't like. She says I'm insecure but I really dont feel insecure about myself or my ability in a relationship. I just feel everyone would cheat given the right circumstance. Sorry if this is long but any advice would be great. Thank you.",28Sep2019,1
10,"I am as broke as I've ever been, and the past couple weeks my life has been seemingly falling apart (as much as a 20 yo's who still lives with their mother can). I tried my best today and to find some place that can help. But ether they weren't taking new patients/appointments were weeks out. Or they were too expensive and couldn't/wouldn't work with my budget. I tried looking at online based stuff even though face to face works works 100% better for me. All I was really able to find was better help. What I've heard about them specifically lack of vetting was less than ideal, but I figured I might as well try. Then I saw that on a separate part of the site I could find a therapist and they worded like it would help you locate an IRL location/therapist. Then they did the thing that alot of scam sites do where they let you finish all the questionnaires and then Surprise you that that's a paid feature and asked you for payment info. The really shitty thing they did later was emailed me saying they matched with a therapist. And sent a link to where I could chat with then. So I typed out my response expecting them to just try and push me into joining as a paid member, but no the moment you hit enter it pops up asking for payment to send the message. 

Anyways sorry about that rant. I just need someone to talk to I guess. I'm not in ""crisis"" or atleast I'm not going to hurt myself or others. Im just kinda lost and at a loss. I have tried reaching out to some friends but it's basically just talking in circles and them telling me things that I already know. Then I get frustrated and shut back down.

I don't really know where I'm going with this but I'm a mess and I need help and I can't figure out how to get it.",28Sep2019,2
11,I’m 14 and my brother is 16. He’s been smoking weed for about a year now and for the last few months he’s been feeling like everyone is keeping a secret from him. He can’t think of what the secret is but he’s been feeling like there’s been an “Illuminati” formed against him and our dad told everyone in our community to keep it a secret and not to make fun of him. He feels like everyone’s been making fun of him behind his back. He thinks everyone in the community agreed to not make fun of him but some people still do it behind his back. Non of this is true but sometimes it makes sense in his head. Is there an solution to his paranoia like therapy or counselling?,28Sep2019,1

13,I think I’m gonna get screened for a mental illness. I’m pretty positive I have some form of depression and anxiety. But it’s not even that. I feel like I could hurt someone and be ok with it. I’m not empathy challenged though. I care about people a lot. It’s just sometimes I guess I think I could just kill sometime and nothing would happen idk about someone. But a animal one time I slowly pulled the limbs off a garden lizard. So I took a look at my mental state and I think it’s getting a little better.

15,"I'm an RN, currently back at school to get my psychiatric NP. I work in a large ED that sees a TON of patients with mental illness. Where I work (and I imagine it's similar to most Emergency Depts), when anyone comes in with a possible psych diagnosis, they have to take all clothes off and change into gown. All possessions given to family or security. Can only watch TV and eat while waiting for social worker to see you. I usually let my patients read a book they brought, although technically this isn't allowed at my hospital. Sometimes patients sit in their rooms for hours or days. 

What is the worst part of being seen in the emergency department? What are some ideas/solutions to make the process easier for you? I know how stressful this process can be.
I would love to implement some ways in which to make the process more comfortable for my patients with mental illness. 
Keeping in mind that safety is the #1 priority. 

I appreciate any insights or feedback. Thank you.",28Sep2019,1
16,"25 year old male. I have health anxiety issues. A month ago I started to feel out of it and like I’m in a daze, tunnel vision, and like nothing is 100% real. I was calm for the first couple days until 5 days in I noticed it wasn’t going away. I went to doctor and he gave me ant-anxiety meds. It’s been a month now and I went back to him cause symptoms have t gotten worse but nothing’s gotten better. I’m freaked out by CJD from Chronic Wasting Disease from infected deer cause I hunt in Wisconsin in an area where there are deer who have it even though it’s a low percentage.

I went to doctor last week and got MRI on head and he gave me alprazolam. I’ve been taking it for a week now and taking about four to five 0.5mg pills a day. 

I now am worried more cause when I wake up I don’t know if my altered state of mind is from something going on actually in my head or if it’s the constant use and hangover effect from the drug? And then i get anxious and take more pills again an hour after I wake up. 

I saw my doctor today to go over my results and this is the report. 

“1. Nonspecific T2 hyperintense foci within the supratentorial white matter. Differential considerations include migraine associated vasculopathy, demyelinating disease, early onset chronic microvascular ischemic changes, the sequela of prior trauma, among others. This finding is of unclear clinical significance.

2. Cystic lesion in the pineal region without significant mass effect. This is incompletely characterized but may reflect a benign pineal cyst. Consider postcontrast imaging for definitive characterization as benign.” 

I have to go see a neurologist now but that could take weeks for me to see him. I did play tackle football from 5th grade and into college and always played offense and defensive line which give repeated blows to my head. Could that explain the white matter? Also could a benign cyst cause this visual perception problem. 

It’s been a month and I have not got worse or declined. Just on an anxiety rollercoaster and not n owing if I’m having symptoms or if I’m having hangover effects from the Xanax he gave me. Could this be a neurological disease and I’m screwed?",28Sep2019,2

20,"Okay. Before we start, let me just tell you that this is a throwaway account. I'll probably delete this in a week or two.   


Short story time: I suffer from agoraphobia. I can't leave the house. Haven't been outside for about 2-3 years, and before that maybe 2 years. Let's just say that during the last 10 years I've been outside maybe 5 times.   
Obviously, this causes some other problems. Depression, panic attacks, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, so on and so on. I'm on every medication they are willing to subscribe, I have a therapist come over once every month, I have helpers when it comes to delivering food and so on.   
My life is fairly good. But as you can imagine, it gets a bit lonely sometimes and I do get a bit of cabin fever every now and then, so it's nice to have some company over or just talk to people on the phone.   


HOWEVER. I see a lot of people talking on the internet about how they have friends who have long term mental illnesses and they want to know how to help. And here is the secret: Food. Emotional support, having somebody to talk with, having somebody that actually cares are important things. All of that helps, but the basic need for a human being is food and shelter.   


When the depressions hits really hard, I can barely function. Making dinner is beyond my energy levels. I have a stash of microwave food, some protein shakes and other ready-to-eat meals. And here is where you can really help.   
If you are wondering what to do for your friend/family. Cook some food, and bring it over. It doesn't matter what it is, it doesn't matter when it is. If I don't eat it now, I can save it for later. Either way, I have food.   


Most people who have a long term illness usually have a pretty strained economic situation. And I see a lot of people wanting to donate money online or somehow support, but honestly, bring me some outside food. I haven't had barbecue in 8 years. I haven't had Asian food in 11. I can't even remember the taste of other peoples food. All I eat is the same boring shit I make every week.   
Next time you are throwing something on the grill, add a burger for me and bring it over in a piece of tin foil. That way, I don't have to do the dishes, I get free food, and a friendly face.   
Honestly. That's worth more than money.",28Sep2019,3

I have become completely careless and not interested in anything at all. I’m ruining my own life and i can’t do anything to stop it .. i was very active during high school i used to hang out with my friends all day i enjoyed listening to music or watching movies. Then i started college.  bit by bit i enjoyed staying home i enjoyed being alone i sleep by day and wake up by night completely isolated. my friends used to force me to go out they regularly visit me at home and drag me outside to go hang with them and i did for couple of weeks then all of a sudden i start losing interest in hanging with them and go back to my own bubble. After a while it became a normal thing to everyone my friends my family that i’m always isolated like that. Don’t get me wrong its not that i’m unable to communicate with people. I’m very talkative and can talk for hours about a lot of stuff. Its just i always wanted to be alone i felt some kind of pleasure in that. I used to research stuff for hours, read about various things, look for new music and movies and i enjoyed it a lot. 
I go out for couple of weeks with my friends and stay completely isolated for couple of weeks bit by bit i started shutting down my phone and staying home longer 1 month. 2 months.  I stayed home once for 7 months. My phone is shut i sleep by day and wake up by night.  I’m unemployed. I don’t have a girlfriend. My friends barely call me anymore. My family are trying to help me but i get defensive and just tell them to leave me alone i know what i’m doing. But in all honesty i have know idea what is happening to me why am i like that. I feel like i’m living the life of a drug addict without doing drugs. Everyone i know has done something with their life.got a decent job.  got married, had children or traveled somewhere. I see their activities on social media  and i get instantly jealous and depressed i feel bad for myself. I don’t enjoy being alone anymore i hate it. I’m doing absolutely nothing. I can’t find anything that interest me anymore. But i can’t escape the prison that i built. Whenever i go outside i just feel like i need to go back home i feel safe at home. I feel comfortable.

* **Check locks:** Even when I know that my locker/door is secure, I sometimes triple check because i just have the feeling that I have to
* **Reread letters/messages:** I feel like everyone does this but I always check for spelling errors and grammar in my text messages even when they aren't meant to be formal
* **Worry about family:** When I send somebody to grab something for me from the grocery store I have this thought in the back of my mind that they may get into a car accident/get shot  and die and I will have to live with the guilt for the rest of my life
* **Urges:** When seeing a knife this senseless urge comes over to stab by hand or just harm myself. I am not suicidal so that is not the cause 
* **Religious Thoughts:** Occasionally I get diabolic images that cause me to pray ""I love God, Amen"" five times to try and get rid of them. I am not religious in anyway but i think this may be a result of the way my parents raised me

24,"(i felt this is okay to post here because it is triggering my mental health issues as i mention later in the post)

&amp;#x200B;

i stumbled across a post in the r/offmychest sub last week that really fucked me up. i don't think the person will see this, so i will just explain what they said. OP claims to be a 14 year old girl who was raped by her brother, got pregnant, no one found out she was pregnant until she gave birth in the garage, she is too afraid to tell on him and lied saying she was raped by someone else, she is now unwillingly in a secret relationship with her brother but has decided to accept it, he still rapes her pretty much nightly.

i commented on said post (now deleted comments) trying to encourage her to tell on her rapist brother (who is 18). she said she's not ready to tell on him. she started privately messaging me, 'cause my idiot ass said ""youre not alone and you can PM me if you need to"" to be nice as people were calling her a liar and making fun of her, first saying ""thanks for your comments"" but it escalated into her messaging me several times a day telling me WAY too much information about her situation. she tells me how she ""doesn't mind"" having sex nightly with her brother, and that ""he really loves her"" so she won't tell on him. she goes into way too much detail about it on an almost daily basis (she messaged me exactly a week ago today for the first time but didn't start messaging me several times a day until about 4 days ago). if i don't answer right away, she sends more messages. she flat out refuses to tell on him and almost gets defensive when i say she NEEDS to tell on his psychopathic ass.

i am a 19 year old girl. i am not a psychologist. i feel EXTREMELY uncomfortable, first of all, having this literal child messaging me all of these details. i feel bad for her, but part of me is starting to doubt the credibility of this entire scenario and several people in my life have told me to stop messaging this person because they think this is actually some psycho getting off on saying the most disgusting shit you can think of to strangers, but i don't know. (will also note she is apparently 14 and suffers from aphasia but writes EXTREMELY WELL)

if she isn't lying, this is where i feel guilty, but i literally do not have the mental strength to listen to these horror stories. i have CPTSD. i also have OCD. she is triggering me. the things shes saying are HAUNTING me and i'm losing the ability to function normally because my brain just keeps thinking about how fucking disgusting and horrendous this entire situation is and i literally feel sick and am getting intrusive thoughts over and over and over all throughout the day. if i see a baby, i think of her. if i hear the word ""brother"" or ""sister"" i think of her. i literally cannot even watch porn at this point

i feel guilty if i just ghost her. but i don't know what else to do. i feel on one hand i HAVE to take care of myself, because A- i have to and B- she doesn't even listen to me so it's fucking pointless for me to keep reading this shit and saying ""tell on him"" when she refuses to (maybe she does actually enjoy it??? i don't fucking know, i wanna say shes brainwashed, my best friend who is a rape victim certainly didn't enjoy it when her dad raped her nightly, nor did i enjoy the abuse my dad put me through). but on the other hand i am afraid of making her life worse by just not answering anymore. she says her friends all abandoned her and i fear giving her more issues.

i feel terrible either way. would i be a fucking bitch if i ghosted this person or do you think i should ghost them?

26,"About six months ago I became suicidal. It all happened to quickly: my exboyfriend broke up with me, I became completely broke, and was having no luck finding a job for after college, I felt I had no hope left for living. I almost ended it.

All my family and friends know that at one point I was suicidal. I was almost taken to hospital on many occasions and attended counselling for several months that was free with my college tuition. Once college was over i wasn’t able to pay for any therapy to help me anymore. So i used cutting myself as an escape for a while, and now I have scars that will never go away.

But, Thankfully things did start to look up, i became part of a musical production that honestly saved my life. I met the most amazing people who brought me out of my suicidal thoughts and were there for me all the time. At the same time I was able to find a job and start making money. I also reunited with my childhood best friend after 4 years and we decided to start dating. 

So fast forward to right now. The musical production is finished and everyone has went their separate ways again. I live with my boyfriend and we never spend any time together. We’ve been together 5 months but there’s no chemistry. I also do love my job, but struggle with connecting with my coworkers and doing the job right all the time. 

Life is still okay, but I have the want to end it again. I’m not even sad, I’m just numb. It doesn’t feel like life will ever really get better than it is now. I go to bed really early every night to escape life, and dread waking up in the mornings. I still can’t afford counselling, but at the same time if I did I would dread bringing back old memories that may cause me to break down. 

But here’s the issue: if I tell my friends and family again, they will say I shouldn’t be suicidal. They would say that I have everything I need, and I don’t look sad or depressed. They won’t take it seriously. They’d say I won’t do it (which honestly, I won’t, but nonetheless the feeling to
do it is still there). And ultimately they’d just tell me to be happy. 

Every day I put on the brave face and sometimes I do feel happy for a while, but in the last month or so, it’s only very temporary. I just wish I could somehow tell them that these thoughts are back again. 

Has anyone else ever struggled with something similar? What’s the best way to go about telling them? 

Thanks :)",28Sep2019,1

32,"Let me give a brief backstory then cut to the chase. Ever since I began dealing with various issues, Metallica, more specifically James Hetfield and his lyrics have been a TREMENDOUS help. Knowing what James has been through makes me feel less alone.

Today, coincidentally on the 33rd anniversary of Cliff Burton’s death, Metallica announced James’ return to rehab. This has taken a huge toll on me.

James has always been my prime example of strength by showing that there is light at the end of the tunnel. His ability to turn his life around made him godlike to me. Seeing that even James isn’t immune to being pulled back into the trap has made my head spin. Over the last year or two I dove far deeper into Metallica’s than ever before. The relatability of songs such as “Fixxxer”, “Until It Sleeps” and “Fade To Black” (to name a small few) has given me strength in times I felt I had none left. His interviews have given me a different outlook on life that I strive to see everyday. James has been like an unofficial therapist to me. For that, I am forever grateful.

On the contrary, it makes me feel like I owe a personal thank you. To know one of my heroes is going the something similar to myself at the same time is amazing, sad and confusing all at once. It makes me realize that it’s okay to get help and that the best of us need it just as much as anyone else. I’ll definitely be thinking about this for a while. It’s just been a freakin’ whirlwind of a day and I needed somewhere to get this off my chest. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this splurge.

I want to wish James a speedy recovery.",28Sep2019,0
33,"Going through high school, I (22F) was always very thin. I didn’t care back then, my metabolism was really high and I ate whatever I wanted. Around graduation, I weighed no more than 115, and was/still am around 5’7. After high school, I gained about 30 lbs in “adult weight”. I looked hot. My ass and thighs came in, I had that thick girl look. 

I started as an exotic dancer earlier last year, which made my confidence soar. I made money from my body and my self esteem was so high.

34,"It's been years since this happened, and it feels like it's been building up inside me.. i'm not looking for anything, but I feel like I don't have anywhere else to talk about this except online anonymously. No one else knows except for a close friend I told years ago and his family. It's been affecting my mental health recently, and no matter how I try to ignore it it finds a way to catch back up to me and hit me.

For context.. when I was younger my family and I moved from our stepdad's apartment to the house we're still living in today. I've just started highschool, but he still comes by sometimes now that he's grown up and moved out of the house to visit my stepdad.. and I know he's changed, and it's been many years but in a way I still hate him. It feels wrong to hate him, because for so long my family engraved it into my brain that it wasn't his fault and that he was young and that I've exaggerated it because I was a young kid at the time. He is my stepbrother. And he is around 8 years older than me.

I was little.. elementary school I think. I'm not sure how old he was at the time, I can't really remember. But it was not long after we moved into the house, so it had to be past 2nd grade. I only remember my older stepbrother, who mainly lived with his birth mom, leading me to our parents bedroom and trying to convince me to do sexual stuff I didn't want to do. He didn't touch me physically, but he kept going on about how ""it wouldn't hurt"" and that he'd ""buy be anything at the store I wanted"" if I did that favor for him. I didn't follow along with this because still even as a kid there was a pit in my stomach saying that something wasn't right, and I kept saying no and ended up getting out of my parents bedroom. Again I don't remember him trying to force himself on me or do anything to be physically, but he undid his jeans..

I later told my mom when I was younger, and she ended up getting pissed and driving to his mom's house to confront the parents in that home. I remember sitting on the rock outside of his mom's house confused as each of our parents kept saying stuff to eachother, and I'm not sure if he apologised but later on they told me that he ended up getting help. I think they only kept it between them, but I never ended up getting a counselor to talk to about it or any help and I feel like I'm not allowed to tell anyone; it keeps building up even though it was so long ago. I've tried taking to my mom about it about a year ago and she said it was ok for me to feel that way, but I feel like she brushed it off saying that he was a young and stupid teenager and I feel like she was trying to defend him, like she didn't want any trouble involving the family. 

Recently, the older brother that had done this has been struggling with an injury involving an important part of him that helps him control sense of movement. I feel like I can't say anything to a counselor in case they would try to take legal action, because I feel like my family would hate me and that it would ruin his life that he has been trying to rebuild, as he is trying to be normal again after the injury and the injury could strike back again any moment. It has made tasks harder for him to do, and he has had to have a few surgeries to help him try to temporarily help this problem. I feel like it is wrong for me to hate him for what he did, because I feel like it's selfish because of his injury. No one talks about it and it feels like a nightmare, but I know it's real because my mom had remembered it too. My stepbrother just goes on like it never happened, and tries to act like the cool older brother and I hate it so much. I don't know what to do except accept what happened and move on myself.. but I don't know what to do. I can't talk to anyone because I'm scared they'll think I'm lying like my family did, and I don't want people to see me differently. I can't talk to my stepdad either because he views him as his perfect son and kind of worships him because he doesn't see him much.. I'm afraid it doesn't count as child assault because technically he didn't touch me or anything, but my stomach drops and I feel sick when I think about it. I feel like it doesn't count in a way because people have had it a lot worse, but I really don't know what to and I feel really lost. I dont want any legal action or confronting, I just want to find a way to cope and move on so it doesnt affect my life as an adult. I'm sorry for the rant.. But if anyone has advice, please help. It means a lot to me.",28Sep2019,1

36,"recently, i’ve been sort of psyching myself out of telling people things. it’s like there’s this mental tape over my mouth or something. it’s quite scary. about a week ago i was eating dinner and my mum was on the couch and i silently almost choked on my food, i went to grab water and calmed down a bit, i really wanted to tell my mum what happened but i just couldn’t. i don’t know why.

2019 has been the worst year of my life. i have the best family ever and my life was great until may of this year when my younger sister attempted suicide. it’s something i could have never seen coming as my younger sister was considered the most active kid in my family as she had lots of friends and a nice job and stuff. i think i was in shock at first as i felt nothing, but  i’ve developed a sort of really dark depressive mindset and i feel like i’m going crazy, i feel physically nauseous and anxious and scared.
this has gone on for about 3 months and then it took a break where i felt ok for a bit but then it has come back again.
i really want to ask for help or tell my mum about it but i keep psyching myself out of it too which i feel is more damaging and serious.

I lost myself years ago to mental illnesses. 

I used to feel like a person. I /was/ a person! I talked to people, even if it was just via text. I had friends! Friends. I can't imagine having those now. 

I was never home on the weekends. I could go outside without crippling fear. I didn't cry every single day. I could get out bed. I showered regularly. I took care of myself. 

I laughed. Oh, how I miss laughing. Most days I laughed until I cried and my stomach hurt. But the better part is, I used to make people laugh! Laugh until they almost peed themselves. People would tell me I'm funny. I haven't made someone laugh in a long time. I can't even fathom it now. 

I do try to be someone again. Even if it's not my old self. But I fear the scars of losing who I am/was (and so much more) has hindered me forever. I wonder if I'll forever be lost. Just a shell of human.

49,"Hi... So this is gonna get ranty. I apologize in advance. I'm also on mobile, so forgive my formatting. I hope this all makes sense. I'm happy to share more details so feel free to ask.

(Tiny bit of info for anyone wanting to help. In case it is somehow relevant, I am 25/F turning 26 in November. Since I am seeking local services, I will say that I live in Utah, USA.)

So... I'm not entirely sure what exactly I'm dealing with in terms of diagnosis. I have been officially diagnosed with Epilepsy, Clinical Depression, and General Anxiety Disorder. I've been told by professionals, though not officially diagnosed, that I may have PTSD, Panic Disorder, Schizoprehnia, or Bipolar Mood Disorder. Though I don't quite think those last two are the case.

I'm just gonna leave a list of crap that is messing me up right now. I don't really know how to say all of this properly in any other way. Sorry if it's strange. I'm doing my best to explain while making sense and not going into a full rant and getting sidetracked.

-I only have internet friends. I mean this genuinely. I have no friends irl. My family hates me because I refuse to join their church amd therefore I am a terrible person and an incarnation of the devil himself, metaphorically speaking. I am alone. My online friends all have their hands tied here. I have nowhere to go, physically.

-I have Tinnitus. I always have this rumbling sound happening in my ears. This is relevant because the rumbling noise sometimes triggers my Panic Attacks. My Panic Attacks appear to be at least partially due to some sort of sound.

-Due to the same inner ear damage that causes my Tinnitus, I have Vertigo. The world will randomly start spinning and I have trouble standing or walking during these episodes. My brain also loves to jump to the conclusion that it is an Earthquake whenever I have these episodes. So there's another big trigger.

-Storms are my worst trigger. We got hit by a tornado a few years ago. I live in a very mountainous area so they're pretty unusual here. It wasn't too big (F2) but it did throw 2 trees onto my neighbor's house and the cracking noise it made caused me to collapse, screaming. I stayed like that for the duration of the Tornado and a whole lot of s**t happened afterwards. Ever since then, if it even rains a little then I get anxious. This has been getting slowly worse over the years. When it gets windy or a thunderstorm hits, all I can do is crouch under my desk and plug my ears while I cry.

-The panic attacks only last through the storm, but the anxiety and anticipation of the next attack is constantly present. I obsessively check my weather radar, even when it's absolutely beautiful out. I can never get completely calm and am always stressed beyond belief. I feel like this will never end and the entirety of my life from now on will be lived in fear of nothing.

-During the attacks, I lose control of myself. I have thrown things and hit things and even smashed my head into a wall once when I got so frustrated that nothing was working to calm me. I'm unaware of what I'm doing and as a result I'll take an anxiety pill to help it stop... Then a second... Then a third... Then a tenth... Then I'm in the hospital for an overdose. This has happened 3 times and I'm terrified that the next time, I won't be found in time...

-I am NOT suicidal... Do I feel hopeless? Yes. Do I hate myself? Yes. Do I want all of this to end? Yes... But..... I want to live... I want to find that reason to keep going... I want to get better and overcome this... But during these episodes, I'm not all there... I lose that will to keep up and as I said before, I worry that one of these days, I'll go through with it...

-I've tried so hard... I meditate (or try to) and I've tried burning incense and exercising and eating as properly as I can manage and keeping certain scents of candles. I've done breathing exercises and used essential oils and put rocks with ""special energy"" around my room. I could go on, but you get the point. My medication is doing nothing and all the usual calming methods have been useless for me. So please don't say ""Have you tried ____?"" because chances are I have.

-My mother is... I don't even know anymore. She has intercepted all of my attempts to get a job. I am financially and mentally dependant on her. I can't pay for Therapy myself and despite my begging, she refuses to spend any time with me... I get yelled at when I leave my room to do anything more than eat or go out for one of my walks... I can't sit in a room with her and I can't have a conversation with her without it developing into an argument or screaming match... She is all I have. I need her now more than ever and for whatever stupid effing reason, she vehemently refuses to be there in any way and stops all of my attempts to get help or get out of here...

-Why have I not just left to go stay in a shelter? Well... It's dumber than you may think. Aside from my fears of everythinf stopping me from putting myself into a homeless situation... I have this cat, you see. I hand raised him and due to his mother disappearing, bottle fed him and the whole nine yards there. He is like my baby. He is the world to me. Eff anyone who says its just a cat. He was there for me when my fiancee died in 2013. He stayed right by my side through the Tornado and did his best to help ground me. And over my past 2 years of being friendless and alone, he has always been there... I can't part with him. Not now. Not ever. There is nothing that can be done to change my mind. He's not licensed, but he has unintentionally become my Support Animal. I. Will. Not. Leave. Him. I would sooner die. On that note, I have stopped myself from committing suicide many times thinking only of how heart broken he would be and how he wouldn't understand what had happened and think that I have abandoned him. He's just a cat, but he is my reason to keep living.

-All of that being said, I really don't know where to go other than a homeless shelter. I'm open to ideas and have also been largely interested in looking into an in-patient mental health facility, but my search for one even remotely close to me has come up empty.

-I have searched for support groups that could help me. If there are any in my area, I can't find them from Google searching.

-I've been told I could look into government assistance, but I don't even know where to start there and again, my anxiety overwhelms me and prevents me from really going anywhere outside of my house or my walk route.

-Another tidbit about my Panic Attacks. When I leave my comfort zone, things get both weird and scary. The world starts spinning, I start feeling and hearing things that aren't there. Not voices, but I often hear wind or thunder when there is none. Loud places extremely overwhelm me. The grocery store for instance. All of the people taling and the kids screaming. Those big platform carts they drag around the store when they're restocking and such cause me to plug my ears and try to get away in a small moment of blind panic. I usually manage to get it done, but not before running out of the store in a panic a few times. Thankfully, the employees there know that I can't really help it and they're pretty helpful when it happens.

Those are the major things I can think of. I don't know what to do or where to go or how to make it stop. I'm making this post because I'm beyond desperate. I need help. I need something. It's getting worse and I know it's only a matter of time before I either snap or kill myself... I don't want that... I don't want to be that crazy person screaming at random people on the street. I don't want to die. I have dreams to live out... I feel so helpless and just... empty... What do I do?",28Sep2019,1
50,"It is often the case when we aren't well and it seems that nobody around us can help. Our situation seems permanent and it feels it will never come to pass. All seems lost. There are no ways of comforting yourself.

51,"I’ve never really understood what the world around me was. It’s always seemed so distant and unclear in a way that feels un describable. The humans around me seem un natural and scary, the walls surrounding me feel like a box I’m trapped in. My mind is blurry, and trying to understand my memories is like having 7 different puzzle sets while trying to make one giant puzzle. Nothing makes sense and it feels as if the voice in my head is the only trustworthy thing in this world. I have talked to my therapist about depersonalization/derealization and it seems like a label that will stick, but I don’t think I believe it. Perhaps it’s an illusion trying to trick me into trying to be brainwashed by reality, or maybe it’s just something my mind has come up with to try to understand the things around me. I don’t know. I feel as if trying in anything is pointless and I don’t understand why all these “people” keep on telling me to work on my life when this life is completely meaningless and misleading. I don’t know if I’m going insane or if I’m just understanding something that others can’t see, but it’s scary and I just wanna stop feeling like the only person I know.

I don’t even know if I can trust my own self anymore. If I can’t prove anyone else exists, how would I prove I exist? I want to know where and who I am but it seems like my questions will never be answered. To be honest the only way I feel I can escape this is if I die. Perhaps than I will understand what and who I am instead of drifting in this nothingness.

Everything is falling apart now, and the rest of my family has basically checked out, each in their own ways. I don't feel strong, just like a good procrastinator. Not sure where to turn now, or what I expect out of this post, I just miss them all so much.

56,"In June my family doctor diagnosed me with severe depression. He referred me to the mental health unit in the local hospital and prescribed me antidepressants for the mean time. After not receiving a call for 2 months I assumed that either the doctor had forgotten to send the referral. So I went to see him and he checked if he had sent it and he did in June. He told me that it might be because I’m under 18 and they don’t usually take patients of that age. I was told to come back if I didn’t hear anything for a month. 

Last week I get a phone call from the hospital asking if I was able to come in for an assessment today.

I go in for the assessment and she notices that my file says that I’m 17, she said that because I’m 17 the hospital won’t let me see a psychiatrist there and that I would have to go to children’s services. She did the assessment anyways and put me on the wait list (1 year average wait time) and then the computer gave out some score that showed my vulnerability. I think it was a score out of 8 or something like that. I scored a 6, which meant that they should consider hospitalization, but yet again, I can’t because I’m 17.

She apologizes profusely and gives me the number for children services. I call them and they tell me that they won’t take me either because I’m over 16.

????? 

So essentially anyone in my region that is suffering from mental health issues and is 16 or 17 literally have 0 options for help.


The final thing that I tried was the Canadian Mental Health Association, i went there and begged them to find literally any psychiatrist. They told me that there are no private psychiatrists in the region and that they only had two. For one of them I needed to have a “case” with them (idk what that means) and the other one flies in from Ottawa once every 3 months, but he only stays for 2 days so it’s unlikely that they can fit me in.


I don’t know what to do anymore. There’s no hope for finding any help. Over the past weeks my depression and suicidal thoughts have ramped up significantly for some reason. I honestly just don’t know what to do.",28Sep2019,2
57,"I have Anxiety (GAD) as far as I know. Ive seen about 3 counselors (all through free college access). Ive talked to a doctor. Ive been on Prozac (I was allergic, had to quit cold turkey after breaking into a full body rash/hives that itched terribly. Had to be on steroids.) Ive tried Lexapro and it was horrible. On both I had horrific vivid nightmares and would wake up freezing cold and shivering but soaked in sweat at-least 5 times every night. 
I tried meditation and yoga. 
Benzos scare me really badly even though they have been recommended, I have not tried them. 
Every professional I see tells me the only way to get over my almost constant fears and avoidance behaviors is to just do it. “The only way to solve that is to just do it!” 
I dont understand. I CANNOT. I have thrown up at the THOUGHT of doing some of these things. Its never “easier than I thought” or “less scary than I thought”. Anytime Ive ever pushed myself I end up falling into a really bad low where I lay in bed all day and cant eat and cant sleep. I just lay there. 
I know its probably the only solution. Just do it. But i just dont understand how im supposed to and nobody has ever clarified it for me. 
Just needed to rant because im thinking about delving back into getting treatment, but its funny that anxiety is preventing me from getting help for anxiety.  Its exhausting being on edge 24/7.",28Sep2019,2
58,I've come across this thing in my life where my thoughts or things I've experienced seem so second nature to me that people have to often remind me that they aren't normal. I've told people stories of things that happened to me that feel nonplussed about but they look at me with shock or horror or deep concern. I've also said things and people's response is always that I need to see a therapist but when I think about it in the moment I didn't feel like anything I was saying or what I was doing was indicitave of needing help. Does anyone else do this? Does anyone else forget that they're not normal and that they need to be reminded that they have mental issues?,28Sep2019,281
59,"Watch this video for 1 minute starting at [55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROzPFGpRSqk&amp;t=3321)

Also a couple minutes starting at [39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROzPFGpRSqk&amp;t=2384)

The guy on the right in the white T-shirt, Ori Shapira, is a family member who I care about.

Symptoms:

1. He talks very slowly and carefully, yet he's rambling and barely coherent
2. He makes weird jerky facial expressions
3. You can't tell this from the video, but in conversations, he sits on the edge and observes but almost never participates

He used to have normal social skills and I've seen these symptoms steadily get worse in the last 5 years. There's consensus about this among many people who know him.

For more context, he is a few years out of college and never had a full-time job. He just does odd jobs like getting paid by this video producer supposedly to help produce these videos. I don't understand what he is getting paid to do as he doesn't have any video production skills and isn't even needed to hold the camera.

He seems to not be a functioning adult due to his lack of social skills, lack of financial independence, and inability to give a good explanation to account for these deficits which seem to be getting worse over time.

I'm wondering: What kind of issue might he have, and how do we start getting him help? I feel like a qualified expert might prescribe medication to help him.

I figure that part of his issue is anxiety. On one hand, he knows this video is public. On the other hand, the other person in this video, Allen Saakyan, is his roommate and someone he is very comfortable with, even though he's also his boss... but I've observed that this is also how he acts with everyone when off-camera.

I've brought up the idea with him of getting therapy in the past, but not for a few years. He doesn't think that anything is wrong with him, and is stubborn that he can ""hold space"" and have deep insights that other people can't.",28Sep2019,2

In 2016 I quit my job, was self harming everyday, attempted suicide, was in and out of the psych wards and just generally a fucking mess. It was a really hard year, not just for me but for my (now) husband and my parents. I hurt them a lot and I know they really struggled seeing me that way. Towards the start of 2017 I started to really make an effort to not be such a wreck. I felt so awful for what I had put everyone through, not just in the past year but throughout my whole life. The problem is that I didn’t really get any better. I just got better at hiding what was really going on with me. Im still self harming, still hearing voices, having delusions and feeling depressed and suicidal. I mean sure, ever now and then they see me not doing so well but that’s very rarely and everyone just assumes I’m having an off day. 

I’m no longer under a care team, as last time I saw them they pretty much just said they didn’t know how to help me anymore and discharged me. So I’m on my own. 

Right now I feel like I’m breaking. I’ve been holding everything in for so long I feel like I’m going to snap. 
I just can’t take it anymore. I don’t know what to do. I just want to die. Disappear into nothingness. I mean, I know I said all of this was to stop me hurting them and me dying would hurt them, but surely one last time would be better than a lifetime of me hurting them.

Divorced father, sister up and left, a plane flight from any relatives. My little sisters too young, and my mother is not easy to talk to. She's got her own problems and last time I tried to share what's wrong I got kicked out on the side of the road.


Fourth of all don't comment ""talk to a therapist"" because they're expensive, a lot of work and hard to find. I'm getting one but from the sounds of it they aren't much help for any of problems.

I am still young, and because of that, my friends and many people around me are like- crazy for love, want to have girlfriend/boyfriend/crush. I've seen how much they want to be in love, and I've seen how their stories went, how their relationships ended. I read and watch a lot, sometimes I feel the happiness and the pain that the love stories/films brought. 
I have never experienced, but I know, in real life, it's gonna be much better and much worse. So, I don't want that kind of love, I don't want any romantic relationship. 

As I said, I've been so sad with all my dead dreams. So it is not surprised if I said I very want to kill myself, to be dead. I usually have suicidal thoughts, but I bring me back to reality from those by thinking what is left in this world that I may miss. And I think about ""love"" (by ""love"" in this post I mean that kind of romantic love). My idols have been writing so many songs about love, how love can destroy us and how love can- idk, let us live. The magic of love. So I wonder how I feel if I can be in love. Again, I think that I could be devastated, so- I don't want that. 
And I keep on thinking that I will miss that feeling to be in love if I kill myself. But I still don't want love.

And y'all know what? I know that nobody is gonna love me. I'm not their type. 

Just so you know, I really love myself. I love my soul, I mean, I think I have pretty mind, beautiful soul. But I really hate myself, too. I hate my body. 

I'm fat. I don't do makeup. It sounds like tiny things or something if you come from another country, another culture. I think I'm not that ugly but people ain't gonna love me. 

I think somebody will love my soul. But not with my body, so ain't nobody gonna love me. 

I'm not sad about it, I'm just saying, for you to like- understand my story.

It is not that I feel lonely, I swear, I know my feeling. 

I want to be in love to explore. 
I want to be in love to have that strange feeling.
I want to be in love to feel loved. Feel the magic of love. 

And I want to be in love to have my heart broken. To feel the benefits of heartbreak. 
I want to be in love so nothing was left that I'm gonna miss, gonna regret if I haven't done. 
I want to be in love to be broken, to be destroy, to feel the pain. 
The pain that I won't forget in the day I count all of my pain. Then left that behind me. The day I die. 

I just wanna finish my life.

Eventually I went over and asked her what was wrong, and after awhile she yelled at me that she was OK and not to be worried. I sat with her for the next few minutes until we all left. She wasn’t speaking at all aside from that, just nodding and shaking her head. She looked very withdrawn. What was this? Some kind of depressive episode? I want to know what this is and how to support her in the future, as we hang out all the time. Have any of you experienced this? She said a long time ago she tends to let things build and then she kind of just blows up sometimes. I’ve never seen Betty like this before. All I know is that she has depression.

Ever feel like there's something important missing or in the way, that keeps you from fully understanding what others say and also being able to articulate or express yourself to avoid being misunderstood? A break in the circuit?  
I have these thoughts and feelings and, in my head, they make sense. Perhaps not completely, but they are the beginnings of something bigger, more beautiful... You try to show them, and... it's 'gone'. You don't know the words. You don't even know the images anymore, as if trying to process them into a form others can understand erases it immediately. In a similar way to when you wake from a dream only to feel it spilling out of your head and evaporating, like a taste of dementia. You know you had the dream, but something stole it from your head.

I've been diagnosed with Asperger's since I was 17, as well as Depression and Generalised Anxiety later on. I'm 38 now, and I've grown steadily unhappier and unsure about how and where I fit in society. I keep wondering about what I just tried to describe, and if there's something else wrong with me. Finding it harder to know what to believe, and everything feels like it's just getting more convoluted and manipulative. It's as if the world is doing this on purpose, and all I want is for things to make sense so I can live my life properly.  
I'm pretty sure there must be others feel like this as well, but nobody ever seems to want to talk about it.",28Sep2019,1

73,"This is something that I struggle to remember constantly. Whenever someone passionately tells me their problems, I take it on and feel at fault for their emotions.

It is difficult to distinguish if they are upset at you, or just upset and letting it out. And it is so draining to go through this so much. Most of the time, they are just expressing themselves. But when you are the receiver of these words, it's hard not feel like you caused it since they are telling you about it. 

I just went through this with my partner a few minutes ago. I started crying because it felt like they were mad at me, but they were just mad in general. I wasn't a part of the problem. 

All in all, I think a lot of the time these situations can be misinterpreted. This is a reminder that it's not all your fault when people open up this way. Yes, taking their emotions on is draining, but at least they are getting some relief. 

If it is too much, try to let them know you can't be there to hear them right now. 
If you are the one expressing emotions, I would try to ask if it's a good time to talk, or just give a heads up at some point that this isn't about them, or that you just need to get stuff out.

I’m sexually assaulting/harassing her, and I can’t do anything to control or stop myself. I have no agency over my body, I’m just watching myself in first person as it all happens. I try and try to stop myself but I have no control, i can only watch. I soon wake up and jump up in my bed while shouting. 

Other times, the dreams involve me seeing my friend, seeing the damage I’ve done to her. Some of my old best friends who don’t talk to me anymore. Talking to me, I can never remember what is said, but I know I wake up the same way in the middle of the night.

lol these pat few days have been the worst for me, my self esteem is at an all time low, I tend to overthink many things and mostly on the negative side. One little change in the way you text me can set off a my feelings of being annoying or people not wanting me around... they tell me they do but deep down in my head i truly believe its all bullshit. No one like me, Ill never be the “first choice” ill never be good enough. I really hate the way I look but i Can hardly ever say anything becuase all i get “what is there to be mad about, youre skinny” you have to understand some people dont see “skinny” and a compliment, I see myself as scrawny, weak, worthless, pathetic, stupid, annoying me. I gave a heads up to someone saying I wouldnt be able to attend his birthday dinner becuase ive been feeling under the weather he said it was ok but he wouldve really enjoyed it if i went.. so i went... and it wasnt okay for him. I already knew i was gonna ruin it, cause what dont i fucking ruin? Im just so fucking stupid, always giving advice but never taking it. and having the girl you really like, she says she likes me back but she talks about other guys she thinks are cute or finds attractive to me, im not sure if its because she feels comfortable telling me, or just maybe she doesn’t actually like me ? why ? probably cause im not good enough. I dont blame her tho, what is there to like ? but man just the thought of her with someone else breaks my heart sometimes but its not like i can do anything becuase at the end of the day shes still my friend. and im pretty sure thats all we will ever be... friends. Its really hard waking up in the mornings and not having any motivation or not looking forward to doing anything, just wishing the day was over as soon as you open your eyes. Ive said this a billion times and I will say it again, If i had the choice to not exist, I would take it without thinking twice. And i dont mean to sound ungrateful, because i really  am grateful, its just really hard. i just want it to be over. I want to be genuinely happy again, but by the looks of it, its not anywhere near.

Depression is not cancer. It’s a completely different disease. Yet when I look back on my husband’s depression and death by suicide three years ago, it sure looks a lot like cancer to me.

As an adolescent medicine physician in Los Angeles, I have cared for many patients with depression and mental illness, and as a pediatric resident in training, I also cared for many children with cancer. But the difference in how people view these illnesses is astounding.

Before we met, my husband’s first marriage had ended, and his ex-wife told him that he did not deserve love. Primed by genetics and an abusive childhood, he was convinced he would always be alone. He attempted suicide with an overdose of pills.

When he unexpectedly woke up in the morning, he drove to U.C.L.A. and was checked into the psychiatric unit. He was treated, started on medication and improved. Six months later we met, and soon felt that we were soul mates. He realized he did deserve love. We never took the suicide attempt lightly and always had professional support and treatment.

We were married for nearly 20 years. We had two children, purchased a home and negotiated our marriage as best we could. We communicated well, and had the support of a couples’ therapist.

It seemed his horrible disease was cured — until it wasn’t. He wasn’t cured; as with some cancers, his disease was simply in remission. And while his first suicide attempt was about the fear of never finding love, his second fear, equally unwarranted, was that he was a complete failure as a provider.

My husband’s father was not trained in any skill or profession. He was laid off in his 50s, and never worked again. When he died in his 60s, he left behind a financial mess.

He had always told my husband not to make the same mistakes, so my husband became both an electrical engineer and a lawyer. If one didn’t work out, he always had a fall back.

Even as two professionals, the challenges in our marriage mostly centered on money. We had the typical spending differences, but we worked through the issues well, learned to compromise and were able to save for retirement. We were not in danger financially, yet my husband still worried it was not enough.

During his final two years, his anxiety about work increased. He slept more than usual and lost weight. He also lost his spark and joy. We saw our couples’ therapist more often, and she helped us navigate our issues and helped us better understand how to manage his disease. I cut expenses to help alleviate his worry.

The weekend before he died, he couldn’t get out of bed. I asked if I needed to take him to the hospital, and he said no. On Saturday I called his psychiatrist, who spoke with him and made an appointment for Tuesday. He died on Monday. I found out afterward that one of the last things he told his psychiatrist was that he felt his intellect was going, and that he was a failure, just like his dad.

When I compare photos from our son’s bar mitzvah in 2012 and our daughter’s bat mitzvah in 2015, I can see the change in my husband’s eyes and in his thin frame. His face lacked color, his smile was forced, and he didn’t look as if he were all there; he looked like someone dying. That was nearly a year before his suicide. My rabbi said that my husband, like a dying cancer patient, had been in hospice care. We just didn’t realize it.

When he died, my husband was still in treatment, as he had been for 20 years. After his first suicide attempt, he successfully went through intensive treatment of his disease — comparable to the radiation and chemotherapy phase of cancer treatment — and his disease went into remission. He did everything a cancer patient would have done to prevent a recurrence: He faithfully checked for the earliest signs of the disease returning, and minimized his risk factors. His psychiatrist adjusted his medications as needed and provided excellent medical care, support and counseling. But in the end, everything my husband was doing somehow couldn’t help anymore. He was still on the medication that had worked for so many years, but now it was failing.

Just as cancer may go into remission but still kill in the end, depression is a chronic disease that may ultimately prove fatal even with state-of-the-art care and resources. Not all cancers can be cured. Nor can all depressions. With the strong foundation of our love and his excellent care, my husband had almost 20 years of remission before succumbing to his disease.

I know that depression is not cancer, but both diseases can be insidious. With cancer we see uncontrolled cellular division and the spread of cancer cells throughout the body, and in depression we see the workings of neurotransmitters and how molecules affect mood. Researchers believe each is the result of genetic and environmental factors, and with my husband’s family background of mental illness and an abusive childhood, it’s not hard to see why he was sick.

Suicide is how my husband died, but depression was what killed him. His suicide was not a rational, intentional act, but a complication and fatal outcome of a very complex and difficult disease. Just as cancer invades the body, depression invades the psyche. And just as the surviving family members of patients with incurable cancers know that they were powerless to stop the progression of the disease, so are the survivors of a person with depression who dies by suicide.

I so miss my husband. He was a beautiful, brilliant, sensitive and gentle soul, but the disease made life too much for him. Depression causes many people, like my husband, to seek to leave this world so they can finally end their pain. Just as we keep working to find cures for deadly cancers, we need to find ways to help people overcome the depression that cuts short too many lives.

If you are having thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (TALK). You can find a list of additional resources at SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources.",28Sep2019,16
80,"Last night my drunk wife decided to tell a bunch of people from the UK that the queen should go \*\*\*\* herself.. Some random dude opened up a new kitchen knife set and as he was putting the knives in their knife holder slots, my stupid and drunk wife started screaming ""PUT IT IN SO HARD AND DEEP"" (the knives in to the holder) over and over, and over, and over, and over. She was screaming this and everyone was like awkwardly smiling, like ha .  ha .   ha /:  It wasn't awkward at all.... She started telling a dual Canadian/American citizen that Canada is for fu\*\*ing losers and to make the ""right choice"" and abandon Canada. needless to say I heard all about it. She asked a muslim who was wearing jeans and a t-shirt (in his country who does occasionally wear a long white cloak.. we are just visiting) ""why do you wear that white bulls\*it?"" I know some people might find this funny? Not me, that kind of talk should have gotten her deported.. What kind of mental issue is this? She has incredible mood swings, irritable, sleeps forever, gets way too mad, throws tantrums where she won't say anything or be mad about me not closing the toilet seat for like 3 days for example.. I need to take her to a doctor because I truly believe she is suffering from terrible mental health problems. I just want to see what people think.",28Sep2019,1
81,"I used to be the best debator in school, always winning the first prize among my classmates and also other students of the school. If someone needed to talk to the principle or higher authorities they would ask me to do so, (even the staff members and teachers)

My ideaology of a good debate is one with good content and a strong argument. One of my closest friends asked me to join a club called the toastmasters club. And that was my mistake. At my districts club they concentrated more about they way you walked or looked at someone (for me this came naturally, I didn't have to pretend over it) and not the content. Heck, I was criticized for using a lot of statistics and strong figures in my speeches and encouraged to make up fake stories as stories ""engage"" the audience.

I lost confidence in myself, and for the first time lost a debate competition in 10th, I was too busy caring more about the way I looked than the content. When I got my results, I couldn't feel any emotions. I feel down the stairs, bled but still didn't feel a thing. I was disheartened to an extent I never imagined. People no longer cared to ask me for help.

 I suffered from abuse, trauma and stress in my childhood. But I had a habit of releaving my frustration through debate. Debating was my coping mechanism, a platform where I could finally speak for myself. I was never as self conscious as I am today. I feel defeated and lost. 
My mental health too is getting worse.

84,"i’m 21F and ive had depression &amp; anxiety for 10+ years.
I’ve always been an emotional person &amp; crying has seemed to be my outlet/way of relief.
Example: when i was 4 i had to do a school play and i had (&amp; still have) stage fright so when i had to go up, i cried and refused to go up (guessing from anxiety, but still unknown why even then i was so aware of being center of attention &amp; how i know didnt like it). 
Still to this day i cannot give a public speech.

I cry if i get anxious.
I cry when i have a bad interaction with someone.(anxiety)
I cry if i’m overwhelmed on what to do next.(anxiety)
I cry if i feel like i’m neglecting someone/a pet.(anxiety)
I cry if i don’t want to do something  i must (anxiety)
I cry when talking about my problems to a therapist, a friend, or family member.(anxiety)
I cry when i try to find the right word to say but i can’t find it in my head (anxiety) 
I cry if i’m center of attention.(anxiety)
I cry when i feel like i’m being a bad person (anxiety)
I cry when someone get upset at me for not doing something i was supposed to. (anxiety)
I cry when i stub my toe.
I cry when something doesn’t turn out the way i was hoping.
I cry if i want to do something but my mind tells me otherwise.(anxiety)
I cry when i’m called out.
I cry every morning when i wakeup, and sometimes from just the smallest thing being wrong (ex: no milk for coffee in the morning)

My therapist has been telling me that crying is my outlet of releasing [held in?] stress and that i should not be so worried about it. Makes sense because i am seriously always anxious &amp; in that ‘alert’ mood like scanning the area always. He also said it could be a form of PTSD because my (25M) brother has bullied me since basically birth. 

**I guess what i’m trying to say or ask is like, does anyone else experience this? Or does this look like more then just ‘stress’? **

I don’t have bipolar depression and i know for a fact because i’ve never had the ‘highs’ of bipolar depression-i’ve only been at rock bottom and hardly ever even reach a baseline/content mood. 
And no i’m not taking antidepressants because the last 1 (of the 5 ive tried &amp; all have made me worse or the same) almost made me commit suicide so i’m not going down that road again.  

Also any tips &amp; advice for depression or any of this really, is GREATLY APPRECIATED!!

It leaves me with this after feeling of numbness and a little emptiness after it. The feeling where I destroyed myself or from good turn bad feels like a sort of pleasure, a reliever from the pain as I envelop myself in this pain of doing things that I don't want to.

91,"I grew up in a household filled with broken people. My parents aren’t narcissists but because of generational mistreatment and awful parenting, they fight and behave in ways narcissists do. And when I say fight, I mean fight. Nothing is off limits verbally but if they pushed too far, they’d briefly apologize then never address it again. I was diagnosed with GAD and depression in 2016, I still fight it today. Years and years of emotional abuse and several events that occurred have also led to CPTSD. I’m reactive. Emotional. Lost. Sad. Angry. Frustrated with myself. Healing has been a long journey and I’m miles from where I started, but now I have to conquer the toughest parts of my brain. The anger/reactive/emotional part the most. I explode at my boyfriend and it’s not fair. I don’t want to fight like my parents but it feels almost internally wired. I scream at myself in my head to stop while on the outside I’m an awful fucking person to someone I truly love. I don’t understand this, I hate it, and I’m embarrassed that I can’t be strong enough to listen to that voice. What a task to be handed generations of pain and turmoil with a brain that understands it has to be felt by someone in order to break the cycle...

92,"I really don't know what I should be doing - I have really sudden rises of mental health problems which usually tone down just as fast; this makes it really hard to seek help as most of the time when I arrive there's not too much of a problem.

I have two main problems I've noticed - first is more concerning for me; most often this happens waking up randomly in the night but can happen if alone during the day; I will start to get the sensation that my senses are really heightened - sound will be really loud, my vision most often will ""zoom out"", and touch feels very uncomfortable. This is usually accompanied by an inability to think properly - my mind rushes so fast I genuinely feel out of control, my most effective way to help regain control is to talk to myself; usually repetitive simple phrases. This can last about 30 minutes I think, the past couple of times I've just ended up crying because it feels so pathetic.

Second is what seems to me being random dives into really negative emotions, it can vary from not being able to leave bed and enjoy things to pretty intense suicidal thoughts.

I'm posting because I've just had probably one of my strongest years for a while - I only had two of these negative emotional dives and a few night time wake ups with the first problem. But I've just returned to university today - immediately dropped in emotion, after being pretty excited to come here.

I m thinking the reason could be this girl I like, I decided not to do anything about it since I know how difficult I become in these situations.

Me and her were pretty much friends (she doesn't have too many since she is depressive and likes to be lonely).
Ok, so we were friends and she started having these weird panic attacks, i tried to help multiple times without any success. Since then I started to observe a change in her behavior towards me, when asked she says we are friends and she doesn't have anything against me.

Pretty sure these behavior changes were not in my head. When we were together she is all sad saying ""i m depressed as fuck i would do that, do that"" or just stay silent, but when there is a different person around she is all happy and shit like that ignoring me completely.

I ve asked her 5 times if there is a reason for this but she keeps the same line where she doesnt have anything against me.

This entire thing happened to me like a year ago, exactly the same thing, only the people were different.

there’s nothing i actually want to do with my life. i like art. but i don’t want to be an artist- i just like painting my emotions and using it as therapy. obviously i’m not going to ride anymore. i don’t want to go to college and feel like this constantly. i’m so fucking tired. and the fight doesn’t exactly get easier as you grow up. more responsibilities and commitments come and i will drown under them. i can’t keep up now how am i going to survive being a self sufficient adult. there’s simply nothing i care about enough or am passionate about enough to want to stay alive for it.

I feel like this combination, on a daily basis creates an extreme anxiety, persistent paranoia, I suppose i could be a little delusional, but of course I'd like to think otherwise.  I have intrusive thoughts of self harm and self violence towards myself constantly, and my way of coping with this is punching myself. I used to for around 7 years cut myself, but my partner now lives with me and she has been somewhat motivational to me, in my eyes, the punching is many steps below cutting, so i feel like that itself is a step. However, in severe times, I tend to surround myself in dangerous activity, for example, I'll open a window as wide as possible and be as close to that open window as i can, given my fear of heights this baffles me, I think my head sees it as a way out if needed and it provides me comfort knowing its there.  I have been hospitalised and on meds,i am now on nothing and in my own flat with my partner, My question to everyone today was, how do you help yourself in a time of torture?

When I first came on campus, there was a hoard of people who suffered from mental illnesses. A great number of people I met were very open about depression, anxiety, bipolar and a host of mental health struggles. I took great comfort in this fact, finally believing I was not alone.

However, as the weeks past, I realised that everyone was so... normal. Everyone was chirpy, energetic, charming and charismatic. All these people who waxed eloquent about taking meds and had Instagrams dedicated to their poetic depression were leading extremely colourful lives, partying, smoking and making gaggles of friends. Not that they didn't suffer - I'm sure they did, it just never 'wrecked' anything. Not publicly, not academically. Not in a way that would yield the severe shame and self-loathing that tormented myself and others.

112,"I fel guilty 90% of my life. I know it's because I feel like I always could be doing better and helping someone more.

Here's the problem:

In my 30s. I pretend I'm okay most of the time, was diagnosed with MDD 5 years ago which I feel like was a misdiagnosis. Perhaps I have more of a personality disorder. Anyway, I act high functioning and never let anyone know if I really feel down because I would feel guilty about burdening them etc. The same cycle of isolating myself and so forth.

I am extremely bitter and admit I have unresolved anger that everyone thinks I'm fine since years ago when I had counseling and since it's been years and years since inpatient. No one asks about my mental health in my family. I know I can't ever expect them to be mindreaders though. 

My younger sibling, who is out as trans and who I've always supported, also has the support of my parents. Which is amazing since this was a scary thing given how my parents reacted to me coming out as queer years prior. My mom at least has acknowledged that she's so sorry for everything that's happened in the past. And of course I want my sibling to be accepted because it's a huge deal becoming your authentic self. They need all the support they can get.

Now, my mom just confided in me that my sibling is showing signs of depression and we're worried. My sibling is moved out and I am going to suggest they see a counselor. I've always supported them and usually send texts here and there of ""I love you, always here for you"" etc so they know I give my support but I feel I need to DO more to invite them, let them know I want their company. 

Again, asshole me, feeling upset because I hate to see them suffering but being frustrated and all sorts of emotions because I'm working so hard to not show signs and no one notices. I'm so fucking selfish. I want to be there for my sibling but it's like I feel chained by my own mind. I know I need to ""get out of my own head"", it's just fuck. 

Then I ended up mad at my mom for bringing me down and telling me how my sibling has been texting her depressing things yet never reached out to me. 

Maybe I'm just always tired of worrying about anyone else. I know that's an awful thing to say, sometimes I just feel like if that person isn't going to see professional help (pot calling kettle black I know) then stop constantly saying ""I'm so worthless"" because as many times as we tell them ""you are not worthless "", it doesn't matter. You have to realize that for yourself and get counseling to help you understand why your mind is telling you lies. 

I underestimate how mean and bitter I can get. Especially these times when I want to completely move away from everyone so I don't have to feel the weight of always putting them first. Which sucks since my sibling probably already feels like a burden...",28Sep2019,3

Tl;dr: I decided to finally see a psychiatrist and need advice on how to talk to them, how deep and personal to get, how far in the past or just general advice and personal experience for someone who's never been to one and is having anxiety which is begging me not to go but I know it's for the best. 

I have finally faced that I've been falling in-and-out of depression for about 6 years now, after I have been mentally and couple of times physically abused by my ex boyfriend. I didn't really tell anyone back then because I didn't want to stress my parents even more and some people actually did not believe me that a good guy like him could do the things he did. I finally accepted that I might have some ptsd left and with it came severe anxiety attacks and other episodes which affect my daily life. Weird is, sometimes life's good but then *bam* it gets bad and worse and lasts a month or so. I do have a lovely new boyfriend now, thing is I don't think he gets how bad truly is (but that's a topic for another time) therefore sometimes my weird behaviour affects my new relationship badly (it has potential to become eventual marriage but that's in the long-term future).

123,"**Introduction**

Loneliness is the reaction to physical isolation, or perceived isolation and alienation in the presence of other people. It can cause a variety of unpleasant emotional responses, and can increase the risk of a number of health problems.

Research has shown that loneliness is prevalent throughout society, including people in marriages, relationships, families, veterans, and those with successful careers. 

According to a 2018 survey from *The Economist* and the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), more than two in ten adults in the United States (22%) and the United Kingdom (23%) say they always or often feel lonely, lack companionship, or feel left out or isolated.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cause**

Loneliness is generally caused by a lack of friendships, and relationships during childhood and adolescence, or a lack of physical presence of meaningful people. It can also be a symptom of certain problems such as chronic depression, or represent a dysfunction of communication with others. Loneliness is also studied as a social phenomenon that is capable of spreading like a disease throughout a population.

&amp;#x200B;

**Effects**

Loneliness has a [wide range of negative effects](https://www.verywellmind.com/loneliness-causes-effects-and-treatments-2795749) on both physical and mental health,﻿ including:

* Depression and suicide
* Cardiovascular disease and stroke
* Increased stress levels
* Decreased memory and learning
* Antisocial behaviour
* Poor decision-making
* Alcoholism and drug abuse
* The progression of Alzheimer's disease
* Altered brain function

&amp;#x200B;

**Tips to reduce loneliness**

**1) Prioritise intimacy** \- A sense of loneliness doesn’t just come from not being around people physically, but from a lack of true connection and intimacy.

**2) Embrace authenticity** \- Perhaps you feel lonely because you have become a stranger to yourself by denying your true authenticity. Risk being more real with yourself and to others.

**3) Real conversations** \- Talk more about things that are real, important, and meaningful to you, rather than shallow and generic small talk.

**4) Choose friends carefully** \- Minimise interactions with fake, shallow, or toxic people, and spend more time with supportive, loving, and real people.

**5) Humbleness and modesty** \- Sometimes our ego is what prevents us from truly connecting with others, so by embracing humbleness and modesty we can improve our connections to others.

**6) Spirituality** \- Pay attention to and grow your spiritual side, which can help to feel more connected to the world around us.

**7) Altruism/Volunteering** \- Contributing to the world through altruism or volunteering is a great way to meet others and feel like you are making a difference.

**8) Embrace solitude** \- Use time alone to work on yourself, appreciate peace and quiet, and practice self-care if required.

**9) Hobbies** \- It is always good to have a hobby or two, which can bring enjoyment and allow you to make new friends and connections.

**10) Evening classes** \- Considering taking up a course or evening class. You can meet like minded people whilst you expanding your repertoire of skills or knowledge.

**11) Travelling** \- Perhaps a change of location is what is needed. So take a vacation someone new or consider going travelling.

**12) Common compassion** \- Realise you are not alone in your loneliness, because it is currently an epidemic, and many other people are suffering too.

**13) Optimism** \- Embracing a more optimistic mindset and trying to see the positives more will open up the world to you more, than if you expect failure and rejection.

**14) Learn something new** \- Challenge yourself to learn something new, or study a different subject. Learning more about the world or history may help you to feel more connected to it.

**15) Keep a journal** \- Try to establish patterns of when you feel the most and least lonely. Is it certain people? Certain places? When you behave a certain way? Then set some goals to try to solve this problem.

**16) Talk to someone or a helpline** \- Try and find someone you can trust and talk to, if you don’t feel you can trust anyone then give a helpline a call. By talking to someone you will be letting out how you feel which will make you feel a lot better.

**17) Take it easy** \- Being lonely can feel bad, and coping with it can be difficult. Don’t expect to fully solve it straight away, rather, focus on coping with loneliness one step at a time.

**Quotes**

&gt;“Risk being seen in all your glory.” \~ Jim Carrey  
“To find real peace you have to let the armour go. Your need for acceptance can make you invisible in this world.” \~ Jim Carrey  
“Loneliness expresses the pain of being alone and solitude expresses the glory of being alone.” \~ Paul Tillich  
“I used to think the worst thing in life is to end up all alone. It's not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel all alone.” \~ Robin Williams  
“Loneliness does not come from having no people about one, but from being unable to communicate the things that seem important to oneself, or from holding certain views which others find inadmissible.” \~ Carl Gustav Jung",28Sep2019,4

125,"I know a lot about boundaries, I go out of my way to respect my own and other peoples. 
I've done some pretty dumb shit, ironically I worked in a mental hospital but was fired for reasons which I'd rather not go into after becoming highly erratic and I would say possibly dangerous, abusing alcohol and benzos (which I've since quit) didn't help.
 I wasn't delusional, but at the same time I felt as though I was running the place and could cure everyone in there. 

I go to arts and animal therapy every Friday which is supervised by mental health professionals, I've been super active this week but I'm having trouble focusing and I tend to want to either smoke or vape my head off or jump from one task to another. 

I'm terrified of myself, I seem to lose all of my inhibitions and become so overconfident and reveal personal stuff to people and feel ashamed after. But because I have insight into what I've done after the fact, it makes me even more afraid because 'they' say I have too much insight into my own behaviour to meet any criteria for a diagnosable illness besides the run of the mill depression and anxiety. 

I've lost all contact with virtually all of my friends and I don't feel as though my relationship with my family is mutually respectful, leading me into more isolation and more despair. 
I just don't know how much longer I can carry on like this. Something has to give. I just don't know. 
Making myself homeless would make me worse.

129,"I have no idea how many people live in the apartment adjacent to mine, but I know that the layout of their apartment puts their bedroom right adjacent to my bedroom.

They had loud music and bass booming at 11pm last weekend so I went and banged on the door (because the music was loud and when a guy came out, he was super pissed. He started shouting ""Banging on my door is something I don't appreciate"" (word for word, I swear). I stood up for myself, raising my voice to voice my concerns back at him, but he would cut me off over and over again. I think I was pretty terrified when I think back.

140,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but I cant think of any other place. Im 15F which I know is young but I don't feel like this is just a puberty thing.

Throughout the last school year (18-19) I felt constantly out of place at school. My mum had cancer and I was struggling at home too so I never really had an outlet other than the school counsellor. The sessions mostly focused on my mum as teachers usually suspected her to be the cause of my troubles but it was being at school that was a lot worse. I've always had a close group of friends but I started to feel like they didnt want to be around me anymore. I felt that people didn't want me in their space and like i had essentially been blotted out of existence. I tried to put myself out there and talk more but it never seemed to work. Luckily I had a bf who was very nice to be around through all of this. 

During Summer things were a lot better. I was pretty much happy throughout and even when I did get sad I would remind myself that it was only temporary. School starts, I look forward to it and everything is good. 

Last week my bf broke up with me out of the blue. He explained that it was because things at home were bad for him and he needed space from everyone. I was upset but I tried to be a good friend since from what he told me, he needed one. 

Today a close friend of mine had a party. It started off really fun, I was dancing with my friends and everything was good. I didn't care who was looking or not. Then my ex came. I was a bit shocked because he told me he probably wouldn't but whatever, I greeted him with a long hug. He didn't talk to me for the rest of the night, barely looked at me and went off with other girls (he has the right to of course though). I was confused as to why he just wouldn't talk to me but i just wanted to dance and have fun. 

Night goes on, stuff happens, I continue dancing but slowly come to realise that none of my friends are with me. Every few minutes I'm having to go and look for them. Nobody for me. I felt like I couldnt breathe. Everything from last year came back. 

I tried to join in with everyone elses dancing. Gave up when the group literally moved away from me as soon as I joined. I felt alone. 

You might be thinking that Im probably a bitch or something and of course sometimes Im not very nice but i keep that stuff in my head. I've been described as the nicest person people know. I doubt its true but Ive never been given the impression that im disliked by many. I always try and include people, make them feel wanted. I dont want anyone to feel like I do rn.
