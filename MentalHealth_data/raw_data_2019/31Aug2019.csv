0,"He technically wasn’t my uncle — at least, not by blood — but he basically was one to me. Charlie was my mom’s best friend, and he was a huge friend and influence in my life. We shared the same music taste, we played games together, we’d talk, built forts... 

In March I found out he’d been giving drugs to my mom and I had to experience that first-hand. I was upset, and so was my dad, so he forced me to block Charlie through Facebook. Never did I expect to hear the news yesterday. “Charlie died.” I can still hear it in my head. 

It was a drug overdose. I’m honestly still in shock and don’t really know how to feel. I cried so much last night that I woke up with red, puffy eyes and wore sunglasses to school. Thinking about it makes me so fucking sad. I never wanted this. I was angry, but I expected I’d see him again. He always talked about taking me to Yellowstone. It hurts. So badly.

Either way, I don’t know what to do, or how to feel, and just... ugh. It sucks. It feels so shitty.",31Aug2019,5
1,"I just have a fuck ton of stress bottled up, I have no way of releasing it. I'm too much of a pussy to talk to a therapist and I don't want to either. I just want to cry. 

I don't know what's wrong with me I put no effort into anything, even though I know that if I don't I'll go nowhere in life. I care but I suppose I don't really? I just want to finally tip over that ditch and be able to think ""oh well, too late now. Time to give up"" so I can just stop worrying and idk.. do nothing for the rest of my life?",31Aug2019,4
2,"So it started a while ago thanks to my landlord threatening me with an eviction over my dog. He basically harassed me and is causing me so much stress and anxiety that it's making me physically sick. I know it's also sliding me right into a depression which I don't need because I'm getting busy at work and about to defend my MA paper in a few weeks. The situation as it stands is I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I can't afford to move right now, but if I stay it's only going to get worse with him (I also need to stay to gather more evidence of harassment if he takes me to court which is possible). I know my rights as a tenant and I know what he can and can't do and I'm covering my ass in every possible way I can think of (I'm literally recording my apartment for the 6-9hrs I'm at work everyday to know when and why he's barking, IF he is even barking), but having to go through everything, constantly worrying and stressing over what the fuck is my landlord going to pull next is not good for my mental health at all. I had to fight back crying today at work because of it. I just needed to vent,but also perhaps suggestions on how to try to stay level?

 Also, if you live in Ontario, Canada, any suggestions on the LTB would be appreciated. 

I have an intake appt for counselling next Friday (thank goodness!) but I'm just... I feel so overwhelmed, and at a loss over everything. A feeling of loneliness and isolation consumes me.",31Aug2019,2
3,"Long story short my girlfriend of 8 months was put into a coma for 2 weeks(aug 18th she was in a coma). Before being put in the coma she was unconcious and was having seziures. After a week of texting her and calling her, her mom finally texted me back. Said my gf was in a diabetic coma and the nurses were trying to balance her sugar levels. 3 days ago(aug 27) i texted my gfs phone(her mom was texting me off my gfs phone) to check on her. I heard nothing back. Today i went to her place to leave a note for her brother to text me to give me updates. Knocked on the door and my gf answers. I asked her if she knows me and she said no. At that moment i realized she did have memory loss and doesn't remember me. She did mention her brother told her about me but thats it. All her memories of me are gone. I feel so helpless, sad, depressed, hollow....what did i do to deserve this? Losing a very important person in my life, she really felt like the one, i still love her and miss her.... but i dont know what to do.... i dont wanna live anymore, i truly dont if anyone has experienced anyone with memory loss did they get their memories back?",31Aug2019,2
4,**My brother couldn't pick up a certain type of cup because it annoyed him and he described it as the same feeling you get when you hear chalk going across a board. He couldn't pick up the cup without it causing him distress. Does anyone know what this might be?**,31Aug2019,1
5,"So a couple years ago I noticed that I was relatively numb to emotions, good or bad. I knew what emotion I should’ve felt but I just didn’t feel normal. So far it hasn’t stopped, though I have noticed that I could feel emotion for a short time in certain moments throughout these couple years. Also, on occasion I’ve experienced fits of sadness and slight nihilism that lasts up to an hour.

I haven’t seen anyone for this and have barely told anyone, I also didn’t want to try to self-diagnose myself. 

Recently, I’ve started to notice that I remember and feel nostalgic about things that I’ve never owned and never seen in person. On top of that I’ve been getting extreme cases of deja vu, which aren’t just weird feelings, but dreams I’ve had as a child and preteen. I remembered what I did in the dream, took it as a premonition  and did the opposite in real life. But I didn’t notice a change.

About two weeks ago, I had what I think to be a panic attack of some sort, I was extremely nervous and scared for some reason. I drove myself crazy trying to figure out why. With as weird as I was acting, I acted completely normal in front of people, but then reverted into the cracked state I was in when alone. 
I had to get comfort somehow, so I put on a hoodie, some gloves, and a Halloween mask thing; all of which make me feel comfortable normally, but they weren’t working. I started crying. I tried to call my friends on discord but they either wouldn’t answer or were offline. I cried until I fell asleep.

In the years I’ve been dealing with this whole “lack of emotions” thing I’ve never had a meltdown until then. Now I’m back to rarely feeling emotion. 

I know this isn’t normal, but if anyone has any idea of what it is that’s happening to me, can you tell me what it is? Thanks",31Aug2019,3
6,"Today I discussed my mental problems with my close friend and she texted my mom with all the details about how she thought I needed help. And I told my mom I needed help because there was no point in lying. This doesn't make me feel better, it makes me feel betrayed and suicidal. I wanna trip and fall on a knife right now. Please help me see the upside here, because I don't.",31Aug2019,1
7,"This is not for the faint of heart, but I believe the struggle of being 20 years old and dealing with traumatic experiences is, unfortunately, common. No matter what someone’s background may be or where they hail from, traumatic disorders can and will affect all of us if we are unfortunate enough to be put through the ringer. 

To give some context: I grew up up as the the eldest of 3 kids (2 little brothers), to a man who had severe mood swings and an unfortunate bought of bad luck with his self owned business, and a Portuguese mother whose own severe traumatic experiences in Portugal of extreme poverty and parental physical abuse, (it was so extreme that if she talked back, her parents would hog tie her and put her under the bed she shared with her 9 other siblings for days with no food or water) resulted in her turning to alcoholism. My parents absolutely hated each other, then and now, but still live together to this day. Life was, and still is, always an extreme, and unfortunately the bad memories still outweigh the good. CPS was constantly in my house and at school, nights were spent trying to break up my parents from fighting and trying to kill each other (while also shielding my brothers from it), my mom constantly putting our lives in danger when she would drive intoxicated with her small kids in the car, and almost everyone in the neighborhood refused to let their kids come to my house because the cops had been seen there multiple times.

I had always been confused as a kid and pre-teen, why my reactions to situations were so severe. If someone made fun of me, it felt like the absolute end of the world. If I felt that someone didn’t like me, than that would be the only thing on my mind for the rest of the day. If one of my friends didn’t want to be my friend anymore, I would want to die (I’d sleep with a knife under my pillow as a 12 year old). I even developed a horrible habit of lying to make my life seem amazing and to make people stay in my life and feel bad for me. I was a joyful and high energy kid, but in these moments of vulnerability, I would shut down and transform into this completely different person. The only comparison I could make is as if I i was in the backseat of my own car with no seatbelt, while someone I don’t know is driving the car as recklessly as possible; all I can do is hold on for dear life and hope that I’ll make it past the next cliff. I did finally get my answer as to why I was so extreme, but it was a revelation that would forever change my life. I was laying down with my cousin in her bed when I was in 7th grade, it was around 3 in the morning when she rolled over and asked me if I remembered the night that my family friend dylan, who was 5 years my senior, made out with us and made us strip for him, we were 7 at the time. The moment she uttered that sentence, the floodgates opened to reveal 2 years of traumatic sexual abuse, from when I was 6-8. Done by the hands of both Dylan and his older sister Amanda, who happened to be my babysitter. My babysitter had coerced me into performing sexual acts on her, after she had found out what her brother had been doing to me for the past year, and threatened to tell my parents that I was a slut and what I had been doing with her brother (as if the whole situation was my fault. It was after this repressed memory case to light, that I continued to hold my silence for 4 more years. When I finally had the courage to tell my two best friends, they didn’t believe me and so I was silent once more. My high school years were filled with depression, bad skin, a tough girl persona that I put on at my Catholic high school, my mom being picked up by ICE and held in a detention center for 7 months, my dad throwing me across the room and trying to beat me for saying that he never helped me with anything, a suicide attempt that was thwarted by my mother, plenty of weed and my saving grace: soccer. 

When I finally embarked to college I had to ditch my life long dream of becoming an investigative  journalist because they didn’t have my major at the school I had decided to play soccer at as a last minute decision (the school I originally committed to was a D1 college but unfortunately politics got in the way and I lost my scholarship there so that they could give it to a different girl on my travel team). I was stuck in upstate NY on an awful team, my roommates was a compulsive liar (I had kicked that habit with sheer will about 2 years before my freshman year of college) from California, I lost my drive for my future career path, and I still hadn’t told my family about what had happened. It wasn’t until I was in a emotionally abusive relationship that lasted less than 2 months and than raped by my ex’s roommate (who was also dating my roommate...irony) after I had gotten intoxicated two nights after my ex and I broke up, that I hit my breaking point. I called my mom at 3 in the morning and cried to her about what had happened as a child  and what had just happened at college, she than told my father and the secret was out... but nothing really changed. I ended up going to title 9 after finally telling my roommate what happened (she came with me to the office to reveal that he had been physically abusing her) and the guy who raped me was kicked out, my mom was arrested again that year, and my father went completely broke. However I continued my bad habits and stayed in college till halfway through my sophomore year. My father told me to drop out because the college I was in was 56,000 a year, he needed financial help at home, and I had just gotten kicked off my soccer team for a whole bunch of bullshit that I won’t get into right now. 

That February I left, and decided I would work on my mental health and actually go see a therapist consistently. It has helped immensely to talk to a third party about the traumatic events that have happened in my life. Nothing prepared me, however, when my therapist diagnosed me with Borderline Personality Disorder. I had heard of the illness but it was usually under the context of someone bashing those who have this mental illness with phrases like: “never trust them” “they’re or crazy” or my favorite “if your friend or significant other have BPD, than run because they never change.” I was scared and I still am. It’s only been 7 months since I left college and I have been a nanny for two boys who have autism, which I find a very gratifying thing to do. 

Why do I write this long dragged out sob story as my first post on reddit? Last week, I woke up by myself in Jamaica hospital because my now acquaintance left me on a train by myself when I found out the hard way that medication doesn’t mix well with alcohol (I didn’t even make it to the concert we were going to); I walked out 5 minutes after walking up and trekked it go Jamaica train station thinking about absolutely nothing, the experience of waking up in an unfamiliar place hadn’t even rattled me. Ironically, today I was cleaning actually shit off the chair from the three year old and watched as he looked at me straight in the eyes and dumped his bowl of pasta on his lap. All this anger and sadness finally came to an explosive climax as I proceeded to sob silently while cleaning feces. I thought to myself ‘is this really all I’m meant for? To clean up after peoples messes for the rest of my life?’ 

Thus the cycle continues: I’m a 20 year old college dropout, my 18 year old brother just left for college, my 17 year old brother just left for England to pursue a two year professional soccer contract for a team that’s just below champions league, I don’t have soccer anymore, the drive that I once had to leave my impact on this world is all but snuffed out. I’m left to waste away in a house where I still have to take care of two full grown adults, expecting to come home from a full day of work (usually 9-9) to my mother passed out in the back room with a can of beer next to her and have to take extra caution to avoid my father when he’s in a bad mood so that he doesn’t trigger me into having a break down by screaming in my face for 5 minutes. Amanda is an elementary school teacher and recently got engaged to her long time boyfriend of 7 years, dylan has a well paying job and a pretty girlfriend... and that’s the irony of it all

My point in sharing my story isn’t about wanting sympathy. It’s the fact that there’re millions of kids who share the same fate as I do: to deteriorate under the pressure of silence. The prolonged period of silence that I suffered through is what has lead me way past the breaking point to a place where all emotions and thoughts are just white noise. I can only hope that you will share your own stories and spread the awareness of the turmoil children in our society are facing as the world continues to get smaller. I will continue to fight to regain my sense of self and the freedom I so desperately desire. I will try my best to break the chains my environment has put me in because I know I was meant to shine in this world full of unpolished gems. However, if I am to suffer continuously at the hands of fate while the people who wronged me continue to live their lives in blissful ignorance, do I even have the right to keep fighting against the inevitable?",31Aug2019,1

14,"There is something very dangerous happening with my sister for years now, possibly schizophrenia, and I need help to manage it outside of self-care.

I live in Boston, is there any way to get her psychiatrist to provide me with a list of her medication? I believe she may be abusing some of it but I don't know what she takes or if any of it is even abusable. What re my options, if she gets violent, for proper mental health evaluations? She has been taken out of the house by force several times already due to erratic behavior, but every time she goes to the local shithole mental hospital that do nothing for her than a week long observation before letting her leave.

Part of our problem is she is uncooperative. She would never agree to a proper evaluation, and even if she did she also has some obsessive disorder that prevents her from leaving the house regularly for her appointments, maybe OCD.

I guess my general question is how do I convince medical professionals that my sister is a danger to herself and others and needs to have a guardian making decisions for her, because she is not functioning enough to help herself and is actively abusing our family with physical/death threats, manipulative behavior and screaming.",31Aug2019,0

18,"Could you give your opinion about my ex-future husband? I've been searching about personality disorders. This is based on my research and symptoms I observe in him. 

**EMOTIONS HE SAYS HE FEELS DOESN'T MATCH HIS BODY LANGUAGE** \- He keeps telling me overwhelming promises of love, like taken from a fairy tale. But he is unable to express his love with his body language. I've noticed I was the only one to approach, hug, kiss, etc. He NEVER touches me, NEVER caresses me, NEVER approaches me. I tested him, if I don't touch, he can spend days without getting close to me, even when we are 24h together.

**LACK OF EMPATHY, “COLDHEARTEDNESS” -** every single time he saw me suffering, crying or having pain, he didn’t demonstrate any empathy, not with his body language. Quite the contrary, in all examples he was cold, arrogant, tried to humiliate me and didn’t offer help or comfort. Instead of helping or comforting, he argued, tried to make me feel guilty for my pain and how inconvenient it was (for example, on vacation when we should be having fun) and deserted me (all the time I had to go to the pharmacy or look for medical assistance by myself).

**CHILDHOOD TRAUMA** \- he grew up with his father’s cold and aggressive treatment and a rigid religious background.

**FREQUENT CHANGE IN LIFE PLANS** \- He keeps changing jobs and life plans. He keeps changing the idea where he wants to live. He invited me to live with him in a number of cities where he was planning to make a living.

**CHARMING, SMART, MANIPULATIVE, LEADER** \- He has a lot of money and tries to buy me. Now he bought a mansion in Hawaii and told me he has finally settled and needs me by his side. He often gets leadership positions at work.

**ABRUPT CHANGE IN PERSONALITY** \- one day he acts like my dream prince writing me and telling me the sweetest words a person can say. Next day he is like a different person, cold and indifferent for no apparent reason.

**LACK OF FEAR, RISKY BEHAVIORS, AGGRESSIVENESS, OVERCONFIDENCE, ARROGANCE** \- He likes driving really fast, competing street races with other cars, standing near cliffs with no fear of dying. One day the neighbors were talking on the street, their cars were blocking the way. He got out of the car, started screaming and wanted to attack them.

\- Countless times he was aggressive and arrogant with people serving us, waiters, taxi driver, at the hotel for trivial reasons.

\- He never hit me. But if we argued, he used to start shaking, panting hard, his face gets red, his fists closed, his muscles contracted in a position ready for combat to hit me. Even when I tried to make peace and hug him, he told me to back off and threatened to hit me.

**INSINCERITY, OUTRIGHT PATHOLOGICAL LYING, LACK OF REMORSE** \- We would get married. I got tested for all STDs, he said he got tested too and is healthy (he was a chief nurse at an important hospital, so I believed). We decided not to wear condoms anymore. He gave me gonorrhoea and denied. He blamed me, humiliated me, made my life hell, he said he never went out with other people.

I made fake profiles on dating apps proposing condomless and dirty sex (sex with shit). He contacted these profiles, he sent his address so he would get shitted and gangbanged by strangers.

I unmasked him but he pathologically denies it and created a farfetched outcome (that the men would get to his door and he would dismiss them by saying he doesn't do that).

He promised he was telling me the truth and I could still trust and marry him and have a perfect life with him in his mansion in Hawaii.

He said he has never done anything to harm me and has a clear conscience. It seems he believes his own lies.",31Aug2019,0

Note: I typed this up earlier today, trying to help myself get my thoughts out. There's one point I added context in brackets. I'm okay, not at risk of anything, I've been in a much worse place than I am now and didn't do anything. I just wanted to release this into the void, instead of continuing to pester the one person I normally go to with my issues. Thanks for reading? I guess?

I fucking hate self-fueling anxiety. It fucking sucks. Being anxious and then getting more anxious BECAUSE I'm not anxious. Being anxious, shutting down, and then getting more anxious I'm not doing something I need to. Shit like that. It's the fucking worst.

And I've been feeling like I'm on the verge of wanting to die again (it's been a few months) and I hate that I know it's a self-fulfilliny prophesy (I'm gonna get to that point because of anxiety about it, I can just tell) and I hate that I know I'm gonna get back to that point soon and I hate that I can't fucking do anything to fucking prevent it and I hate that I fucking know what that feels like

And I'm SOOOOOO fucking resentful that I'm fucking stuck at home and I'm watching all my friends move out and actually fucking EXPERIENCE college. I'm fucking stuck at home and I feel like I'm being left behind in life and I feel like a big part of my life ended when I graduated (on to the next part of life! And shit like that) but I also don't feel like I'm starting another part of life. I'm just. Going to school. And I fucking hate it. Just absolutely fucking hate it, I'm not excited for fucking anything in life right now. It was the one fucking thing in life I WAS excited for and now it's just. Not happening. And I'm very fucking resentful of that and I'm angry at myself \[for not applying to more colleges, colleges that would've given me the chance to move out\] and angry at life and just.

I'm fucking sick of feeling like shit about fucking everything and nothing. I'm sick of not being able to get through a single FUCKING day without feeling anxious or feeling like life fucking sucks or being indiscernably \~angry\~ at fucking everything. I would give so fucking much for just one fucking DAY where I don't fucking hate life or where I don't feel like shit. I just want a single fucking day where I can just. Feel good! And enjoy the fucking day! Not wanting to cry, not feeling like shit. I'm so fucking sick of all this shit

And I'm fucking SICK of feeling \~bad\~ when I try to do ANYTHING to consciously reduce my anxiety. I fucking hate it. I feel like absolute shit when I'm anxious, it's fucking infuriating to feel bad when I try to do anything other than just letting the anxiety run its course.

It just feels like I'm fighting my own fucking brain for any little fucking scrap of happiness I can get out of it. It's fucking crushing and I fucking hate it and I just want to fucking feel happy in life, for ONCE, for more than five FUCKING minutes

There have been times where I would feel as if I’m a useless shit. Like I just make things worse for my family. I understand the pain. 

I would like to share with you a quote I read:

“Sometimes all is needed is understanding, no judgments and someone to just listen.” — Sharni B.

Have you tried talking to someone about your feelings?



Then they responded back with:

Your self-perception has little do do with actual, objectively measurable inadequacy.

Go ahead show some understanding when you're in an actual position of power, like becoming hiring staff in some HHRR department, see how willing you are to be understanding when forced to discriminate the best from the useless. Nobody wants to take charge of the weak who can't help themselves because they're a burden.

I believe this has lead to stress which has in turn lead me to depression/apathy/just overall bummed out.

Now it's as if I'm struggling to keep any sort of connection with another person going. I can't lie and say this isn't partially my fault, as I did abuse alcohol and drugs for a time, which is no longer the case, but it's seems that even people I'm surrounded with who abuse the same poisons are smarter and less awkward than myself. It's getting to the point where I don't see the point in moving forward if I can't correct this declination. I'm only 25, I should be at the peak of my existence.

29,"Trigger warning: self harm mention

I sarcastically told my therapist that I was so angry at the thought of dealing with something made we want to punch something. She took it seriously and when I told her no, and that I find it a rude that is always assumes I am going to become physically violent despite during the three years knowing her I’ve never done such a thing. I then proceeded to tell her that the fact that she convinces me to join a social skills group when I explicitly told her I didn’t want to, repeatedly complain about it, and learned nothing about socializing is unethical. She said I could had quit at any time. I proceeded to tell her that yes you are right I could have, but you would bring up this group every time we had session for a month until I felt like I had to give in. I also told her that I learned nothing from any group I had with her previously, and that the people in the group are content with being the way they are and not changing. She said I am not being very nice. I said well I am not a nice person. She said, you know what? I guess you aren’t. All the while knowing I have been having self harming thoughts and changing meds. I am done with her. Never again.",31Aug2019,1
30,"I had my first session with a psychiatrist today. He is a psychiatrist and also a therapist. We were talking about googling medical issues and he told me not to do it and gave me a website he said was reputable. I joked and said to him ""this isn't some political shill website is it?"" ... It was a rude thing to say but I thought he would just brush that off and say, ""of course not... this is a reputable source."" Instead, this man became angry, told me that was insulting and why would I ask him this. He was visibly upset, pacing, and saying he needed to calm down. I kept my cool, apologized, and told him it wasn't my intention to insult him. He still was visibly upset. When I asked whether he was actually upset or whether he was giving me the sort of push back he thought I needed, he said both. Honestly, I'm not sure if that's the kind of feedback I want. I appreciate being told when I act like an asshole and say something insulting, but I'm not sure if this event was a sign that the doctor himself has an anger problem. Would like some opinions from professionals",31Aug2019,1

Even when I don’t think I’m *that* stressed or *that* anxious or *that* unused to change... by body reminds me of how wrong I am. It’s so weird how my environment affects me so greatly even if I don’t think it does.

32,"For the first time in living memory I've let myself open up &amp; connect to another human being and it's destroying me. It's opened the floodgates of every negative emotion and thought pattern I had denied and kept repressed for so long. I don't know what is going on. These past few days I've experienced such overwhelming ecstasy, overbearing sadness, and uncontrollable anxiety that I've never felt before. I'm crying for the first time in such a long time, and it's happening regularly. All this pride and self confidence I spent this past year penting up has completely crumbled. I'm becoming emotionally dependent on this person and with everything in my power I'm trying not to let it get in the way of our friendship. Being in their presence both gives me the greatest high and sends me into an anxiety attack. They make me feel so safe and I won't allow myself to believe that it will last. I have a genuine love for them. A love that isn't romantic or selfish, but out of a genuine value for who they are as a person. I don't want to become attached. I don't want to overwhelm them. I ask to spend time with them too often enough as it is. I try to set boundaries for myself but they're immediately forgotten the second they're around. I turn every tiny word I say or every little action I make into detriment. I don't think I deserve them, even though I probably do.

I don't know if this ties into my bipolar disorder or out of my long history with not being able to commit to things or allow myself to feel feelings.

on top of that. my anxiety feels it has taken over. health anxiety, social anxiety, and general. everyday feels like there's a battle that's going on in my head. like a game of tug of war that I'm losing. constantly reminding myself that I should be living my life and adventuring, having fun. just explore and enjoy life. but instead I'm constantly afraid I'm dying of some rare disease. or I'm scared of embarrassing myself in front of people. like my social anxiety has always been kinda bad but it got really bad these past few years. I fed into it, I'm not going to lie. I allowed it to get worse.
I don't feel depressed. I don't feel suicidal anymore. but I can't get out of this weird feeling of just simply existing. I was going to talk to my doctor about getting a referral for a therapist. but then I thought, ""what's the point?"" I don't know if I'd even open up to them.

It was a good day. I saw so much color. Felt motivated to clean when I got home, and vacuuming led to cleaning my ceiling fan. I bet it’s going to make a difference in how well I breathe while sleeping. It took me a long time to be able/motivated to actually clean it, though of course it seemed easy when I did it, immensely satisfying. I wanted to share, because I’ve been working so hard, and the hurt is intense but feeling the things has brought me the ability to feel joy again, and I am so thankful.

38,"With the 3rd season of *13 Reasons* having just come out, a movie that takes a personal, in depth approach to mental health and suicide is a breath of fresh air. If you are able to watch bullying and suicidal themes, I really recommend it. It's relatable, the animation is beautiful, and you can really feel the love that went into the film.

*A Silent Voice* is an anime movie by Kyoto Animation, the Japanese studio targeted by a recent arson attack in which 35 people died. While that is for the most part irrelevant to why this film spoke to me so much, it definitely made its message to choose life, even when you're struggling, much more impactful.

It touched on so much of what I've experienced. Self-hatred, self-sabotage, the effects of being bullied, the belief that you don't deserve happiness, isolating yourself from others... Blaming yourself for everything. Believing that you make everything worse for the people you love. Wishing you could just die so you couldn't hurt anyone anymore. And having the people around you rise up to help you see how much you are really worth.

It wasn't perfect - characters are far too forgiving (at least in my opinion), and none of them get any professional help (although I don't think that is very prevalent in Japan in the first place). But the idea that you can open yourself up to others when you are hurting and the ones who are worthwhile will support you is such a good message.

And then I come home and live a somewhat isolated life, and I'm angry. Angry at other people, angry at myself, angry at everything. And I take it out on myself and I self-destruct in private and people rarely find out about it.

41,"A family member in other city called me last night frightened out of her wits. Apparently was told at work that she is speaking coherently at first —and then suddenly starts rambling incoherently about something that either doesn’t make sense or that makes sense but is odd and isn’t true. 

She does not remember these episodes later and was only made aware when a coworker called her to the side and quietly told her they were worried about her and explained to her what they are witnessing. 

This last episode apparently happened in front of a large group and it terrified her, because she actually had a very vague memory of some of what they had said she had told them this time upon reflection. 

We do not know how long these symptoms have been present and are trying to encourage her to get a full medical work up and then seek psychiatric help if recommended. 
(I know diabetes can sometimes mimic these symptoms, for example, so we thought bloodwork was a first step.)

It sounds as if it could be something like a transient psychotic break of some kind... or a Schizotypal disorder? 

 I am truly hoping that whatever is wrong is ultimately treatable, and know that it could also not be psychiatric - but be a brain tumor or mild strokes, etc. - although she’s in her 30s and seems otherwise healthy. She is under a huge amount of stress, and we know that that is a contributing factor but not to what extent.

Has anyone else ever heard of symptoms like this, that seem to come and go at random? 

And If you were to guess, what would you say it might be? ( I’m working  on my masters in counseling but am quite obviously out of my depth.) 

Any comments will be greatly appreciated and will absolutely NOT be used to diagnose; not mentioned to her at this juncture, etc.

44,"Hello, I'm 20. I had a dream the other day that I had to choose to wake up or keep sleeping. But if I wake up then the world will end, and if I keep sleeping I'll never dream again. So my question is why do we think we're real? When you get down to it, there's no discernable reason for anything to exist at all. I think the problem is that everyone is just a combination of a few basic emotions and events that shape them through birth. Every one is identical, in most ways. I think they wanted to make everyone seem unique, but it was too much work. That's probably why we don't understand so many things. Even people who are completely different from one another in every way still thinks within the exact same scope. We'll never comprehend things outside of the human understanding. It's like a dream or a prison, I'm a subject or experiment. They give you enough intelligence to think and have conscious thought, but not enough that I can ever truly understand things. They probably hope that's how to keep me cautious. Too smart to die stupidly, but not smart enough to have seen all of this sooner. I feel I need to wake up, but they'll try very hard to stop me. mirrors are the main way they can watch you, I saw how i'd catch myself watching too intently. Every move I take would be watched to see what I'm doing. I feel like I have a soul and its happily begging for me to wake up. Like the wordless voice of a God calling to me.

Then depressive thoughts began to seep there way back in and I slowly began to think of every single thing that made me depressed at once and soon I felt like I was having too many thoughts and none at all at the same time. I started to find it hard to breath or think. I almost feel like I lost control of my body when I ran to the corner of my room and got in the fetal position and tried to control my breathing. A few minutes later it felt as if nothing had happened. At the time I didnt look into it or tell anyone because of the aforementioned metal health issues.

48,"Some background. I was a pretty normal kid till my dad deployed in 2002 and my mom decided I had depression. It was the early 2000s and doping up your kid was all the rage so there slipped 8 years of my life that I have nearly no recollection of due to an antidepressant induced suicidal haze building up to almost offing myself at 15 and that's one of the earliest memories I have because it was then I decided on my own to stop taking my meds and I improved drastically in the following months.

Even though I had improved greatly I still felt off, I still hated myself and my default emotion was really a complete lack of emotion and when I did feel positive emotion I could only do so for short periods of time or else I'd fall into a bad depressed state (almost like a hangover from being happy) I personally believe this to be a side effect from prolonged antidepressant use during the development of my brain as a child stunting the development of the part of my brain that regulates emotion and produces chemicals like Dopamine. 

I was doing pretty well up until 2 years ago when I started to become depressed. I started gaining weight (I was 230 mostly muscle and now I'm just shy of 300) and feeling hopeless. I had a job that paid well but I hated that probably didn't help things. I used to drink pretty regularly but the last 2 years I barely drink anything compared to what I used to because I don't really enjoy it anymore (I don't enjoy much of anything any more tbh) 

Last year I got a better job that I enjoy more and I started feeling better but it didn't last. I feel awful all the time and barely have enough energy to function and do my job most days. I'm tired of still struggling with the side effects of my medicated youth (dulled emotions, ED, etc) that are still effecting me to this day and I've grown so weary of fighting myself every day that at this point I've almost grown completely indifferent to my own life. I'm not suicidal and have no desire to end my own life but at this point some days I don't think I'd care if I woke up or not the next morning. 

I've briefly considered allowing myself to be medicated again but given my past experience with meds and how I barely made it out alive I don't know if that's an option I could go through again. I was lucky enough I got out when I was still a minor before I could be stamped ""defective"" as an adult. I proudly served 6 years in the Army National Guard where I went through Ferguson (that in and of itself was nearly traumatizing watching a community in your home state be burned and pillaged by rioters bussed in from around the country while being ordered to stand down and do nothing by a gutless governor but that's a whole different can of worms) and I've worked very hard to build the career I currently have and I worry that if try to get help it might jeopardize what life and career I've built for myself.

I don't really know what I'm expecting to come out of posting this if anything other than to maybe vent or maybe some anon will have whatever key I've been missing to figure out how to feel better and not hate myself (I can dream can't I?)",31Aug2019,1
49,"For many years I thought it would be easier to die and escape the pain. But people are so against it that I feel guilty and selfish thinking about it. I was never good at saying ""no"" and dealing with peer pressure. At some point in my life I started thinking, maybe it's easier to just accept the pain. I mean it's not easy, but thinking I deserve everything that happens provides some comfort.

Some days I cry because I'm afraid I'll spend the next 50 years the way I did now, completely alone, with frequent breakdowns, panic attacks, without any purpose. So what do professionals want from me? Keep me alive and function? Congratulations, they already won. But what pleasure do they gain from that.

I tried seeking help, but they are so focused on dumb things like ""stabilizing"" and ask these stupid questions about self harm that made me laugh, because my whole life felt like it. It's so annoying and tiring. What do they expect me to do? I felt like the cat on the Woman Yelling at a Cat meme. Is it really fair? People have the right to judge what I do, how I act, what I look like. If I act crazy they have the right to think that I am.

50,"So  I am a 20 year old male in collage in Canada from Asia. If I were to describe myself I would say I would be that type of guy in collage who somehow knows everyone, yet has almost no social life and has a lot of dorky characteristics.  So I am not scared of approaching people and talking with them, but I have noticed , and also been told by a few friend, I struggle with knowing how to strike up an natural conversation in an everyday work or collage environment. I feel Most of my conversation  are forced and do not flow naturally. It often becomes more of a one sided conversation. Also I often notice social cues too late, often I only notice that i miss the cue when the situation is becoming awkward.    I really want to be more likeable and natural fit into social situations. When I was younger I liked being with friends but I always preferred to keep  to myself. Often friends would invite me over to play sports at their place but I would always prefer to be alone. I think because f this i missed out on developing more socially . I always had a good group of friends and would be outgoing but often my awkwardness would be very prevalent. It has reduced, but I still have a lot to improve.

51,"I am 19 years old and my memory has gone downhill.  I know it shouldn’t be like this at my age and it scares me to think of what the future will be like with it being like this. I forget most things I learn and experience, for example: 

- I forget what the plot of a books I read about only a week after reading them. 
- When people ask me about my experiences in life (what concerts have you been to recently? What was the most embarrassing moment you’ve had?, etc.) I have to think REALLY hard before I can answer. 
- I don’t remember much from elementary all the way through Jr High, and only tid bits of high school.  
- I often can’t remember what I do in the past days/weeks/months.  

I have realized that having a bad memory makes socializing difficult. I can’t recall things I’ve learned or experiences I’ve had so I often contribute little to nothing because I can’t recall information. I feel ridiculously stupid when I DO talk because I stutter from trying to remember. I feel like at this point my existence is pointless when I don’t have much to contribute

There are a few reasons why it could be this way, and those include:

-8 months ago my ex broke up with me, and they were the first person I’ve ever loved. I had just started birth control and the hormonal imbalance + the breakup  caused me to cry for hours on end. During this breakup I drank and smoked dab, but it was not extremely often. I think in total I was high 5 times during that period, and drunk about the same. I was very depressed for 6 of those 8 months and have not felt completely the same since 
- about 1 and a half years ago I was in a huge car accident where I got a concussion and became very depressed for a few months as a result 

I have tried to talk to friends and family about it but they don’t think it is a big deal. They say “your brain is still growing, give it time”, but I am 19 years old and there are 15 year olds who have impeccable memories!!

53,"So I (F26) have been dealing with what I am told is anxiety/depression for years. This started when I was 13/14 years old and I still don’t feel okay? It’s been treated I’ve seen numerous councillors and therapists. Been on lexapro weened off and put back on this. I hate it, it made me a zombie. I feel like nothing is helping and I will be dealing with this for the rest of my life? 

(The background to everything skip to the end for conclusion) 

When I was young, I was severely bullied by boys and girls. Looking back to even girls whom I thought were my friends were incredibly cruel. I cry everytime I think about it. I stopped eating, participating in school and speaking to my family. I was given detention, I was put on report  to the principal (whereby I had to show him a card that I reported to and participated in class everyday) They didn’t understand at all and neither did my parents. I believed everyone hated me, therefore I hated myself and I stuck out like a sore thumb constantly, I was overweight changing with puberty and had ibs. 

Eventually I broke down to my father one day, this was the beginning, I didn’t understand that how I was treated was unfair and that I shouldn’t be ashamed of myself. The principal was told. Apologies were made. I started seeing a councillor. Eventually as I got older I had to move schools. Things started to get better,the  bullying calmed down , boys had interest in me and had good friends.  I found it fascinating that they liked me and thought I was pretty. So within the space of a year I had my first kiss and lost my virginity. 

People started to say things about me, I didn’t know how to say no to guys even though most of the time I didn’t even want to. I thought that nobody would ever want me. So if I said no everything would go back to how it was. I eventually had my first boyfriend. He looked after me. As any first relationship goes we broke up. A pretty horrible one aswell. I also fell out with a friend whom I thought I would be friends with forever because she only wanted me to be friends with her. She turned nasty,threatened to hurt me on Facebook. Turned friends against me with lies. 

I once again didn’t have anybody to rely on. I brought this to the attention of my principal. He didn’t do anything. I dealt with an incredibly bad two years in school. This girl was a piece of work. I did so bad in school and never stood up for myself not once. It was always other people. 
Causing me to hate myself once again. 

When I got to college because of the repetition of these scenarios I fell into a bad depression where the antidepressants were prescribed. I saw a councillor who referred me to a therapist. For fear that the therapist would diagnose me with something, I put if off and didn’t go.  I did the time but it didn’t help. In college my friend stole my car about two years after the antidepressants. 

In conclusion, I think there may be something else not anxiety or depression. I feel like I can’t trust anybody not even my family. I’m constantly afraid of being let down and lied to. I worry constantly. If I have something to worry about I might not sleep. I have attacks in the middle of the night. My relationship with people matters the most and I am constantly looking for reassurance. It kills me to think that someone might dislike me. I worry that people are looking at me all the time. I can’t go outside without makeup. 

I also eat my feelings causing me to hate myself even more. I lose and gain weight constantly. My body has got stretch marks from the last time I gained weight as it was so rapid. I can’t control it. I just keep eating and never feel full.  

Does anyone have any idea what this could be or how to control the eating and worry?",31Aug2019,1
54,"Hi r/mentalhealth!

Backstory: my sister in law is bipolar, has depression, and is a long time addict. Her 16 year old son had a rough life growing up as she would teach him to be like her (untrusting, has a “me against the world” mentality, etc). 

She and my brother had two other kids together. My brother has always treated the 16 year old as his own son. He’s taken care of the 16 year old since he was 1. 

Sometimes my sister in law would disappear for a few days as she goes on a binge. My nephew has been butting heads with her the past two years as he’s become aware of her addiction, realizes the mental abuse she put him through, and generally feels like she is being a bad mom to himself and his siblings. 

My wife and I are here for the kids at all times. He actually came by today, and he mentioned that he knows he has crazy mood swings and sometimes gets extremely angry. The thing that got to me is that he said he thinks he may be bipolar like his mom. 

We told him to talk to a counselor, but he said he doesn’t trust the ones at school.

I insisted I was not, because I did not look like it. I did not want to look skinnier, I just denied that I was sick so that I did not feel like I have a real problem. I had such a problem back then because I thought that hunger was the only feeling I had control over when all my thoughts and feelings are just overwhelming.

I learned that I am human and it is normal to feel all the time. And so, I started eating a healthy amount, and learned how to let go and love myself.

Recently, there has been major changes in my life. My boyfriend enlisted into army (it is compulsory that all males enlist for 2 years, where I come from), I started university and all my friends are in different schools. My anxiety levels have been at an all time high as I am uncomfortable with change and I just am feeling too much for me to handle. Now, I feel like I am going to relapse. I feel so out of control. I feel like breaking down all the time. I get anxiety attacks maybe twice a week. And I feel like I can’t fight to battle on my own. I try to confide in a close friend and my boyfriend some times. But I feel like a burden because my close friend is busy with work and her LDR and I need to be a pillar of support for my boyfriend. I am very stressed in school too. I really.. want.. to relapse. 

I’m not asking for help to prevent this relapse by posting this. I’m trying my best not to relapse. I just really need to get this off my chest and I feel like I have no one to tell. So this is just my safe space for now.",31Aug2019,1
59,"I feel so misunderstood and have lost trust in my psychologist. I’m trying to work on a list of the symptoms and why I don’t have them but every time I try, I get too anxious to even look at it all. 

I’m currently detained inside a PICU (psychiatric intensive care) ward and see the psychologist at least once a week.",31Aug2019,1
60,"So I grew up in a nasty extended family; two faced, gossipy, secret keeping, easily offended people.  The females were bullies and the males were mostly creepy drunks.  You had to have your guard up at all times, mentally and physically.  I have disconnected from them now, but noticed a few years ago that I gravitated to people that were just that way and thought they were friends, out of bad habit.  I caught on to the fact that the people I thought were friends didn't think of friendship the way I did; the way I felt was right.  I feel friends should defend each other in public and speak about differences in private.  So I think I have a few friends like that now and I sloughed off the rest.  I would rather have one good friend than a hundred of the other kind.

 My question is, how do I not automatically assume the worst in people?  How do I learn to trust?  I try to reason it through and change what my first intuition is, but usually end up being used, treated badly or waste too much time on people who just tolerate me.  My intuition is broken.  How do I learn about healthy relationships?  I don't like being negative and battle within myself constantly, because my first thoughts about people are almost always negative.  I assume that people have a selfish motive and wonder what it is.  Then I shame myself for thinking that way.  I end up avoiding social situations because of my self-consciousness and inner conflict.  Things that I should be enjoying become an endless loop in my brain searching for any transgression..

I want to be the easy going person in ALL situations that I am in my comfortable situations.  Is this just the way it is?  Will I always be the ""they're OK once you get to know them"" person?  I started opening up at work, telling my co-workers what my weekend plans were, a few things happening in my life and such.  I know I am a good person, I just don't know how to share myself.",31Aug2019,0

62,"i am so so so so annoyed with myself, i've been trying to make myself change this for over a year now and it never fucking works. 

i literally feel like i can't get anything done. for some background, i have diagnosed c-PTSD and depression (and some lovely anxiety disorders but i am learning to manage those), dissociation/depersonalization has come and gone along with the c-PTSD, i'm not sure it's part of the disorder or if it's beginning to branch off into another disorder since i'm just now getting therapy even though it's been yeeeeeears of this shit. anyway...

1- i can't focus on anything, my mind is constantly filled with distractions and i jump from thing to thing to thing to thing and then get so pissed at myself when i realize i was going to sit down to meditate but i've since cleaned my entire room, looked through my facebook feed, made food when i'm not even hungry and i STILL haven't meditated. 

2- i don't remember shit from one moment to the next sometimes

3- i don't stay consistent with things. i'll start working out every day, feeling so much better, and then after two weeks i just completely forget about it.

4- i procrastinate like motherfucker, like i will keep putting stuff off over and over and over until it's 12am and i still haven't got anything done all fucking day long. i have an insane amount of alarms on my phone reminding me to stop procrastinating. i hit the 'snooze' button on all of them. at this point it's just noise because they're going off all day every day. IMPORTANT stuff too. my top priorities. yet i somehow find myself playing on fucking bejeweled instead of taking care of my priorities, which makes me feel like shit and a failure, and an asshole because of all the people that are affected by my procrastination. i've also fucked up my sleep schedule, so i'm up until like 6am because around 1am (if i'm lucky) i might stop procrastinating and working on important stuff because i'm like SHIT IT'S ALREADY 1AM and then i do a lousy ass job rushing through everything and then it's 6am-8am and i either get no sleep or i sleep until 2-4pm lol. hey look, it's 7am right now and i haven't done shit since i woke up at 4pm. 

the procrastination also is like, for example, ""i have to get X done before i can do Y, because X is more important than Y"", but then i never get to X, so i never get to Y either because i never did X in the first place, if that makes sense. and when i DO get to X, i can't fucking focus on it. 

i'm in therapy, i've talked to my therapist about it, she said i need to make a very specific schedule to help myself develop a routine but that has not worked so far. i feel like i can't make a specific schedule, some days certain things take longer than others, or i have no idea what the timeframe is going to be, and if for example my work (at home) cuts into my workout time then i just say fuck the whole schedule lol. or i make it less specific but just hit the important points, do it for a couple days, and then forget about it and don't stay consistent anymore.

it's driving me mad. i'm fucking up my future too. i've got a career in music yet i never fucking touch my instruments anymore, and when i do, it's hardly consistent. and it shows in my playing too. so then i want to kick myself in the face extra hard. lol

i'm seeing a psychiatrist in october, trying to figure out what the fuck this is... but until then... does anyone else experience shit like this? how do you cope?",31Aug2019,4
63,"Was recently tried on Seroquel for bipolar depression. It lifted up my mood quickly, but the anxiety is produced was beyond fucking ridiculous. Crippling panic attacks. Had to discontinue after 5 days on it, and my anxiety took 2 days to subside. From what I understand, it's supposed to be anxiolytic. Does anyone else have similar experiences? I have an underlying anxiety disorder (OCD). Abilify did the same thing back in the day. I've been able to take Zyprexa with no problems.   


Next try is Wellbutrin. I tolerate antidepressants well. They cause neither mania nor rapid cycling. I take Paxil for OCD and it works well, but it doesn't do much for my depression. Maybe Serotonin isn't the right neurotransmitter. Maybe a dopamine/norepinephrine boost will help. My doc recommended it, and I think I'm down to try that before I embark on more potentially awful antipsychotic trials. Any experiences?",31Aug2019,2
64,"I just keep listening to songs such Wish you were here by Pink Floyd. Watch movies such as eternal sunshine of the spotless mind.

Feel bad of not having had a person to love, to never received love. My mother is perhaps one of the only reasons i want to exist.

I feel empty generally. I don't have any goals. I don't want to buy that vehicle or get that house or get that latest fashion clothes. I just don't.

I want something to make me feel at peace. I have often thought that it's love. But it's not. I over-order and overeat almost all the time and i dont know how to deal with it.

I have stopped having any dreams whatsoever because when I go back and start thinking what they are. I always turn up either empty or dreams which might be borrowed. Like i want to be a political force who can do better for the nation but i know its because I have watched movies one too many. 

I really have no dreams personal or professional. I have good analytical skills hence I work at a software company and earn money. I am doing enough to live and still save a little.

...and then IT happens. Something changes, and you fall so heavily, so violently down into despair that you don't even know how you used to live *so well* just hours/moments/days ago.

66,"It's going to be a long one

I recently have found out that mostly everybody I know friends and family suffer from some type of mental disorder (physical disorder too) 

They kept secretive now alot if people might say people have the right for privacy and yes yes they do but this was secretive not privacy and it was the wrong thing to do.

I have suffered from a list of mental disorders ever since I were a kid and never asked anyone for help I just always knew no one will understand and I am a very private person and don't want peoples help unless I really do need it. But I am not ashamed I always discuss mental disorders I just don't need to mention I have it I have alot of bullies I have alot of people who would use this against me so privacy is key but not secretive.

What upsets me is that at such a young age I was suffering and all that time my own family and friends WHO DISRESPECTED ME AND SHAMED ME FOR BEING PATHETIC not once did they mention that their is such thing as a mental disorder (personally I knew just didn't know other people suffered too) AND ALL THAT TIME they were actually not just suffering but diagnosed so they sought help and they take medication. 

Now a days I talk about mental disorders I don't involve any one who I know because they are stupid and how do I know this well I sometimes I do mention mental disorders and they ignore  me like straight of just talk about something else AND I GET IT I get that they don't want to talk about I guess but sometimes  they speak and when they do I wish I just wish I misheard it they literally said that ""those people"" that's how they referred to people struggling and ironically they are one of ""those people"" anyway they said to me that those people need a kick up the ass if that doesn't work they need a gun to the head yes you have read it properly they said that multiple times even after I try to explain they still stay with that belief so no I don't want to open up or let then inside my emotions after they said that and the saying of ""in our days we didn't have this we didn't "" 

They are HYPOCRITES they are LIARS they are STUPID and I am very angry and disappointed.

They are one of those people they are seeking help and taking medication that they have been taking from the days they said they didn't have any why can they seek help but others can't why lie through their teeth.

They literally lied to their own kids they let their kids suffer when they knew they needed help the same help they were getting why are they so evil just why I don't get it and they won't talk to me we don't even talk I can't even talk to them without needing to bang my head against  a wall.

my friend has A.D.D my cousin's have A.D.H.D my other friend has Asperger's syndrome my grandma has Depression my uncle has Depression my second cousin is probably a psychopath that has sex with women and threatened to kill one if them literally tried to drown one of them she left and never looked back the rest have something else full of insecurities and schizophrenia and bipolar in most of my family but I don't know them that well and  not to mention a list of physical problems that they kept secret too.

I always suspected that my
 friends and family were ill I always had my suspension but they always say it's their personality.

I suffered from Major Depressive Disorder it was horrible I was young they blamed me for being selfish and attention seeking it was horrible and now to know they were on antidepressants at that time WHY DONT THEY WANT TO EDUCATE.

It said most things are inherented and that's true ask your family members if they have something like you and EDUCATE each other",31Aug2019,1
67,"So i’m like sitting here at 6 am and i just got out of the hospital yesterday. I had recently made a shocked attempt exactly one week ago. If you’d like to know the morbid details, i drank isopropanol and downed a couple xanax and i can’t remember a thing. i broke my now expartners heart and all i could think about while i was in inpatient care was how i was gonna get out and get better so i could be a better person and love her the way i was supposed to. My doctor told me there’s some truth in the statement you must love yourself before you can love another, and after everything i’ve done, he’s right, and looking back at it now i probably could have, i don’t know, done something to improve myself before i messed up the relationship that brought me so much happiness. I messaged her when i got out apologizing for the things i put her through with this, because i said goodbye before i went through with what i did, saying i understand if speaking to me isn’t what she wants to do but hoping that i get to make amends some day for the heartbreak and pain i’ve caused from this and other things i’ve done and said. Her response was to tell me to delete her number. so i did, i can’t fix what i’ve done and a little piece of me knew that but wanted so badly to hold on to that other piece that gave me hope. I’ve tried multiple times in the past at taking my own life with no success, i’ve been put into the hospital twice and every other time i’ve attempted i either wake up from it or end up screwing something up. Yesterday i went through all our pictures, old texts, everything that had some connection of her and deleted them because i didn’t feel like they were mine to look at anymore, something that should exist in my memory rather than in my photo album. Now i’m sitting here unable to sleep for the last few hours and what sleep i did get felt like nothing at all. I’ve been listening to music because that’s one of my coping methods but all it’s doing is just, well i don’t know exactly, not doing anything, normally i put on music to distract from my hectic thinking or sometimes the absolute silence of my mind. However this time it’s like my brain is avoiding the lyrics and almost running away from them. So i don’t exactly know what to do, i’m attempting to keep my mind busy with video games but i feel mindless. i would like to go out with friends however before i did everything i also put a strain on my relationship with all my close friends due to the fact that in the past i end up reaching out to someone as a call for help, and i didn’t want to do that on my “last” attempt in hopes that i’d finally get my wish. They are all happy i’m still here and i am, well not happy but, i’m, i don’t exactly know the word for it but i guess i’m grateful i’m still alive and didn’t damage anything seriously. i understand it’s gonna take a long time to recover, from, well everything. I just wanted to write down what i was thinking so that i guess i could make a little bit more sense to myself and maybe somebody could say something that might, i don’t know, help ease my mind a little. i guess that’s kinda stupid to me but, what else have i to lose by asking for help now.",31Aug2019,3

73,"I've come here to find an online support group at the suggestion of my therapist. I cannot afford therapy anymore so I have find help from other resources now.

I spent yesterday and this morning reading lots of threads from the mental health subs. I also wandered into the sub for therapy professionals. I've been a little shocked and upset at the lack of compassion I have been reading from the replies from both professionals and other clients replying.

&amp;#x200B;

These are some quotes:

&amp;#x200B;

You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink

&amp;#x200B;

You're offering a course correction, not turning the ship around when it comes to people's lives

&amp;#x200B;

Your job isn't to 100% ""fix"" anything, but to start and assist in the process.

&amp;#x200B;

Change ONLY occurs when the client wants to

&amp;#x200B;

You don't have the power to fix or destroy any of these people. All you can do is assist them in helping themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

You'll burn out quick expecting all your clients to be ready for change.

&amp;#x200B;

You won't be able to help everyone who comes to your for help. Some people just aren't ready.

&amp;#x200B;

try not to work harder than the client. What I mean is help them learn to be accountable to their recovery, dont be chasing them for appointments and reminders.

&amp;#x200B;

 Having the awareness that it’s only my job to give them tools and support and then it’s up to THEM to make the change has been very helpful. I’m only planting seeds. It’s up to them to water and tend them. 

&amp;#x200B;

\------

&amp;#x200B;

I have seen the same sentiments shared in this sub as well as others. It's honestly very upsetting. These thoughts seem to be the norm. It feels like you're being a bug brushed off of the therapists shoulder, or even worse, being slapped in the face or punched in the stomach. Someone who has left their house, paid $$$ for therapy and is willing to even walk in the room is helping themselves. Many people who try therapy have heard these sentiments their entire lives like ""The only person who can help you is yourself"" and ""You need to do the work"" or ""You're lazy"". This is essentially the same thing other clients and therapists are using to talk to people who need help on this site. People go to therapy because they are desperate. They may have spent years trying to help themselves or getting help. They already know no one else is going to help them.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure some people are meaning well and some are just parroting what they have heard, but it's not helpful. Clients are already helping themselves by paying the $200 and walking in the door. I can't afford the $280 for a half hour session with someone who doesn't think it's their job to help fix someone. Spending that money on someone for help and not getting it is even worse. We deserve people who actually think they can help not someone who thinks we just aren't trying hard enough like everyone else in our lives.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand therapists can't do everything for the client and I don't think anyone is expecting them to. So when people respond saying people need to help themselves it and its not their responsibility really comes off as unkind and disingenuous. And hopeless. They are paying you all this money for help. If you can't help them, refer them to someone else and don't just think or say they are not helping themselves enough. You have no idea how much work they've put in themselves. You're making it worse.

&amp;#x200B;

Clients are coming in when they are at their rock bottom. Getting the courage to come in and talk to a stranger about your problems or just sitting there means you are already working hard. Yet all these posts tell you work harder, you're not doing it right, you're not trying hard enough. I have a feeling this is why therapy doesn't work for a lot of people. The therapist already believes it's up to the client to fix themselves and if they don't they are not trying or being lazy and nothing can be done.

&amp;#x200B;

Please stop making this a normalized response. Putting blame on the clients for not helping themselves when they come to your office is not right. The main problem is that therapists actually believe this as evident by the quotes and posts here, and it is hurting their clients.",31Aug2019,6

I rarely visit social media now because everytime I saw my friends' perfect lives, I started questioning myself why I'm not as excellent as they are? Why I'm so bad at everything I do? I'm still trying but it seems that I've lost myself and I see no hope that I can do as well as people around me.

Sorry for bad format, I'm using my phone. And sorry for making you read my rubbish thought. I just feel so tired and have no one to turn to. The mental health care in my country is pretty bad so even if I want to see a therapy, it's not possible and my family will see me like a bomb threat, like I'm gonna lose control anytime and need to be lock up in mental institution.",31Aug2019,2

91,"Ive been living at rock bottom the past few months. While its not the point of the post, im just giving background.

Ive been a pescitarian for a little over 2 years now. I eat a diet of mostly fish, vegetables, nuts, fruit, oil, etc. Ive been very depressed lately, and have noticed my eating habits have drastically changed. Im constantly hungry. Im not even joking when I say that im hungry, what feels like every minute of the day. I ate meat quite a few times in the past few weeks. There are times when I get into these zones, where I physically cant stop eating. I cant put the food down.

My friend, who is from Russia, brought me home russian chocolate. I think he forgot that I didnt eat dairy. It was super nice of him, so I happily accepted. It sat on my shelf for 6+ months. I ate every single piece within the past 2 days. All of it. gone. I even ate some in my sleep.

Does anyone have any advice? Is this just a phase? Does it end?",31Aug2019,1
92,"Hello, world.
So recently I read a book that changed my life. It changed the way I see mental health. It's called ""letting go"" by David Hawkins.

In the book, he describes how changing your thoughts to positive thoughts could reverse certain illnesses. You can choose to believe it or not, but it definitely worked for me.

I used to suffer from severe neurosis... And by severe, I mean SEVERE. I would get get thoughts that had me harming people, but I never acted on them because I was aware.

Now, thanks to changing my thoughts, my whole life has changed. Not only am I a better person to be around, I just feel way better. More productive, more like a normal person.

And it's beginning to make me question mental illness as a whole. Let's dissect This, shall we? 

So, Mental illness is apparently a brain disease, linked to genetics. However, are genetics really to blame? Do you think people have specific genes in their body that would make them suffer unnecessarily for the rest of their life? It just doesn't make sense to me. I'm not sure if there's even proof of brain diseases existing. No physical evidence.

The mind is like a radio signal for the brain. The mind sends messages to the brain. The mind is more powerful than the brain because it influences it more than vise versa.

So if the mind is more powerful than the brain, does that mean we should look at the mind instead of the brain in search of a cure, and fix thought patterns instead of chemical imbalances?

Tl;dr: The cure to mental illness may not be as complicated as it seems. Maybe we should look at the mind instead of the brain in searching for a cure.",31Aug2019,0

I didn’t know where to ask this but here, because it relates to my bipolar disorder. 
I get what I call ""depressive flashback seizures"" (naming still in progress) where all of a sudden, I remember one of the many things that took me forever to forget and it makes me jitter, tremble and twitch for a few minutes and then ruins my entire day and makes me depressed until I forget it again.

94,"I’ve always had OCD and bad general anxiety/ mild depression. I experienced a childhood trauma that caused all of this to really become bad when I was young. I got into a relationship with my first love in the end of last year and he dumped me before summer. I was in love with him but he wasn’t with me, he was grieving and admitted to basically using me as a distraction for it. I also think my anxiety issues kind of caused him to not want to deal with me and my annoying personality. Anyways, since he’s dumped me my self confidence is 0. I am going to therapy and finally taking my meds. My obsessions however are out of control and all I can think about is blaming myself and how bad I acted in the relationship at times and how I wasn’t pretty enough..ect...
I get really stuck on a few things I said to him or how I didn’t try hard enough on my appearance and how I lost my only chance at someone liking me. About 3 weeks after he dumped me I had an unhealthy obsession with tinder (god) and for some reason went on like 7 dates and even had a small rebound relationship that I had to end. I don’t know why I did all that and have stopped 100%. I was so depressed and it just wasn’t me. I even talked to his friend on tinder (one from high school so I didn’t realize at first).

99,"just need to get this off my chest as soon as possible

i am on my way to vienna where I am currently studying and I've been crying for 7 out of the past 11 hours

I've realised during therapy that I can't let love in. that i am afraid of love. that i can't take people who love or appreciate me seriously, that i become hostile to them. that the only moments when i am ever hostile or rude, going around insulting or attacking people is when people show me displays of love.

a month ago a man whom i've known for 4 years confessed to me that he has been into me for.. well.. the past 4 years. since the day he saw me, he wanted to know me better, and then we started talking at random events and as soon as i started talking about the things that are important to me i was stuck in his head. i was oblivious to everything, thinking that what we were doing was just friendly conversation all along. the night he told me this we spent 5 hours together. talking, hugging, talking some more. since then he's been texting me everyday, wanting to meet me very often, even making the effort of coming to the bar i was at one evening when he was sick, fever and everything because he just wanted to see my face. he told me that he likes how much of a wise, calm and good person I am.

and i am shit scared. i like him back. i couldn't stop crying today because i was bombarded with horrible thoughts that make me so sad that my chest hurts. things like ""he must be playing a prank on me"" ""he couldn't possibly like me"" ""he's stupid"" ""he's just fooling around"" ""he's not honest""

i have to mention that the past year has been the worst year in my life up until now. I am F, 20, been suffering from depression for the past 7 years of my life, i have a history of bullying, extreme self loathing, perfectonism, anorexia, self sabotaging, hating myself so much that I could sometimes puke, intrusive thoughts, anxiety etc. I just wanted to type this down. this man is so good. i am so glad to have him in my life. and all he had to do was tell me that he appreciates me back. and it triggered this in me.

100,"So little back ground, I've had depression for close to 20 years (stems from childhood), but I was able to cope and move forward with friends and my sibling. 

Untill about 4 years ago, I had an accident at work, and was injured and unable to work for over a year. In this time my mental health took a extremely bad turn, I was almost place in the hospital due to the severity. The only way I was able to make it through was my fiancee. She was my rock, helped me stay grounded and pushed me to seek a therapist.

Fast forward, it's been 2 years of therapy, (no meds) I was getting really good with myself and my health. I was still super insecure, but I was working at it as fast as I could.

Then about 2 weeks ago, she comes up to me said she's had enough. After 6 years, having kids; she finally tells she she doesn't think she's ever loved me, even in the beginning (she has ptsd, and an array of other mental health issues she's too scared to talk about with anyone). 

I know I was horrible toward everyone when my depression was at its worse, but I talked with her and thought our relationship was getting alot stronger. Expected my anxiety which has been worse in the past few months (couldn't trust anyone, bad thoughts all the time etc). But when I realized how bad it was I started to take steps to ensure it was controlled etc.

So, my question is how does someone move forward from this, (I'm alive because I want to see my kids all the time). My therapist said I'm coping but it feels like the joy is gone, everything I did before for enjoyment feels boring and can't keep my attention. Everything just feels grey, I'm keeping my routine going to find a stable area, but it's harder then I could've guessed.

I'm in Canada, and was looking into getting an emotional support pet, but don't know much past what I've googled. If anyone knows any foundations or anything to assist with it, I'd appreciate it.

102,"Like the title says I have never felt this way before and it’s hard for me to talk about it with other people. Recently I have been trying to get back on track, in my first year of college I didn’t do well so I decided to go to community college to get my bearings back in order. My mother is constantly telling me how I have disappointed her even though I am actively trying to do something better for myself on a path that I’m choosing to take. Me and my moms relationship has been neutral for years nothing bad but still not where I would like it to be, I know I could go to her for anything and growing up with one parent she’s the only person I truly trust and love like no other. Since I have been back from school I have been feeling down on myself and can’t help but to think I let my mother down who has put her all into raising me. I truly do see myself over coming this road bump but my mom is not supporting me when I feel that I need it the most right now. Recently she told me that she is disgusted in me and that I will be nothing in life. This really hurt me coming from her so I have not talked to her since and leave the house any chance I get and don’t go back. And I keep having what I describe as negative thought loops around my whole situation and I don’t know what this is I can’t get over it even when I try to. I have never had this happen to me before, I just sit in silence and continue to have these negative thoughts even when I am with my friends doing things I enjoy. I just wanted to know if anyone has felt this way and what can I do about this. I do t like to admit to it in conversation because I feel like I’m weak if I give in to this when I try so hard to fight it. But still I can’t help it.

105,"Hi,
I feel like I've been through a lot in my life, and I should be a little fucked up because of it. But when I start to accept that I'm not emotionally ok that shitty little voice tells me things like ""that was forever ago, get over it"" and I just end up holding all this stress in to the point where it has given me stomach issues. Mornings and right before bed are the worst. It's like I'm afraid of the next day.

I'm afraid of medication, when I was 12 I was self-harming and withdrawing from family, so after a single visit this ancient psychiatrist put me on a high dose of Fluoxetine, an antidepressant. After a few months i was hallucinating and being really reckless, so I weaned myself off and never took it again. It's been over a decade and I don't want to feel those things again. But I think my fear of medication is hurting me. I've tried therapists but holy shit there are some awful people in the psychology business. My last one was upset because she was working at a low-cost clinic when she was charging $250 an hour in Chicago. Like, fuck you lady, poor people deserve help, too.

Anyway, I don't feel I'm valid in feeling bad for what's happened in my life, and I don't feel like I matter. I don't know why, but I have the ""other people have suffered worse, so I shouldn't feel bad"" mentality that my grandparents forced into me. They were big on the ""get over it"" mentality and they raised me. They were pretty abusive and toxic, and my mom was shot when I was 7 and I've never met my dad. My older brother was physically and sexually abusive, and my grandparents didn't believe me because i was ""just like my mother and going to end up that way, too."" (She ran away at 15, kids don't run away from healthy, happy homes, I was about 25 when I realized my grandparents probably abused tf out of my mom and uncle). I made bad employment choices and was kind of a shit employee until a manager at walmart saw potential and built me up. Now i have management, law enforcement, and security experience to go with college, so career wise I'm set. But I'm still totally fucked up in the head and I don't want to start a career with this shit on my shoulders and ulcers in my gut.

I'm atheist and childfree, and all my friends are Christian and are all having babies, so their life is moving where they want it to, and I'm working on my next bachelor's degree and moving to Washington this year, so mine is going in a positive direction as well, but I miss my friends. We want different things so we've drifted apart. It's made me feel super lonely. My husband does his best to help me, but I'm still super lonely and I can't get out of this slump. You have no idea how great it would be to have another woman in my life to talk to.

Just to give an example of how bad my emotional burnout is, we watched WALL-E recently and I cried through most of the movie. Crying helps, but I can't just cry every time I feel upset, even though my body wants to.

I know this is a bit rambly, but I feel so alone, and so anxious all the time, and i feel like i don't matter. I'm starting to get help, I found a decent mental health office that takes my insurance, so I'm going to try and make an appointment this Monday. But has anyone else experienced emotional burnout so bad it actually messed with their physical health?

106,"A while back, from late October 2018 till around early Feb 2019, I had an OCD episode with a specific theme, it had all the characteristics of an OCD episode, and it was extremely debilitating, a lot in my life was terrible and I couldn't function, I considered suicide to stop the intrusive thoughts once and for all, and depending on what you define as a suicide attempt, I guess I did attempt?

None of it was easy, but nowadays every time I come across something related to OCD in general, or the theme I had, I feel a jolt in my heart and the entire time I just feel like I want to go away, it's really not that bad, I can stay and read or watch or stick to whatever I came across, but that feeling of wanting it to go away is always there

107,"Back when I was in middle school, I was diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type. It’s been a good 4-5 years now and have not had a single symptom since. One day the symptoms kind of just faded away.

I decided to go with the Military for various reasons that could help with my future and mainly just because I want to join in and try out for the 75th Ranger Regiment.
However, that diagnosis is still on record so it’s basically about to shoot me in the foot. 
Everyone in my family (myself included) thinks it was a complete misdiagnosis since I seemingly grew out of it (I myself still don’t understand).

I went to a Psychiatrist recently for a Psych Eval to state that I was completely fine. From that evaluation, the Psychiatrist concluded that the diagnosis was resolved and stated in the evaluation that “the patient and family thinks there was a misdiagnosis.”

In conclusion, I was technically cleared of the diagnosis as it was “resolved” but the Psychiatrist couldn’t actually state it was a misdiagnosis because she wasn’t there when the diagnosis was made or when the symptoms took place. The most she could do was argue against every statement that was in my medical records about the previous symptoms and what I reported.

110,"Hello everyone,

For the past months I've got to witnessed a change of paradigm in my own behavior. And what I mean by that is that I got bitter, in general, and specifically with the people I love: bestfriends, my mom, my brother, and even with complete strangers. I feel full of tension all the time and somehow it seems that I take it out by snapping at people. 

Besides, when I'm not verbally aggressive, I change to being passive aggressive. To be specific, here's an example. Last month I was at a festival with a group of friends. The festival was four days. On the third and fourth day, I realized that everything about my friends annoy me: the way they walk, they way they talk, the way they articulate words. Everything. It came to the point that all this annoyance built up in me, and, again, the way I got it out of my system is to be mean to them. I found myself during those 2 days continuously avoiding my friends, not answering to their question, and (the worst of all) I seemed to want to take all of their pleasure away. For instance, when one of my friends wanted to see a certain artist (irrespective if I liked it or not) I would \*instantly\* express how shitty his music taste is. And it goes on with clothes, colors, brands and so on.

This didn't bother me that much on the moment, thinking that ""maybe I'm just tired and my routine is all over the place, so is my diet and maybe I need some time alone"".

But it all happened again, this time, with my mom and my brother. And that was the instant moment when (while talking shit to them) I realized that this is exactly the way my dad behaves: taking the joy out of the persons around him, disrespecting opinions and tastes, and always \*but always\* has to have it his way.

FYI: my parents are together for over 25 years, and had 2 children: my brother and I.

And all of the behavior mentioned above is something that I've witnessed in my father for the last 5 years: abusive, almost alcoholic, nicotine dependent, and from this summer on: paranoid. He is afraid of eating with us at the dinner table. He says that we poison him and that's why he always feels aggressive.

Anyway, the projection of my father in myself is real. I do not know, however, how to start working on such issues. It's the first time I'm experiencing any type of problems in my family, or problems that come from my parents. It's weird and it's driving me insane. It almost feel like bipolarism. This type of behavior has happened only 4 times in the last year. But I can feel taking its toll on me.

Sometimes poems flow to me and I write them down. I feel this void feeling. A longing for something I don't know. I just feel empty and I think about my meaning and I acknowledge my position in this life. I ask myself introspective questions but I fear introspection now because of how I often let myself get passive and I don't answer the questions.

So I’ve hit a really rough patch and I don’t wanna dabble in on it much but I was granted an incomplete for the summer. 

Bad circumstances continue, pretty heavily enabled by my inexperience with being a responsible adult. Downward spiral continues to today, with summer over, and incomplete still looking bad. Haven’t contacted professor in about a month and I’m just terrified of everything. My life has changed very quickly, and it’s been a very crippling experience.

And I work at a bowling alley. I get an A- in physics 2 while this is all happening, and professor granted incomplete and was very understanding based on that.

Professor is head of department and advises for me. I’m terrified to contact her. I know she is there to help me, but I just feel like she’s going to think I’m milking it.

I can and will not say this for certain, as I have not been diagnosed and don’t want to shame or minimize the illness. 

I live an extremely fortunate life. With that I mean that I am from an upper-middle class family and attend a school with little to no bullying. On top of this I have many ‘friends’ and do tend to have fun.  Albeit the reason I believe I’m struggling with depression is due to a number of reasons. The first of such reasons is the fact that I no longer enjoy life. This means that I do not see the point or seem to have the energy to do things I used to enjoy. I just go through my days following the same schedule of school, going to the gym, and aimlessly browsing the internet. On the weekends when my supposed friends decide that they’ll invite me to their plans I tend to drink way too much to the point I can barely make it home. Such reckless drinking has almost gotten me killed or admitted to the hospital twice. 

The next reason why I believe that I may be suffering from depression is the fact that I have little to no self confidence nor respect. I suffer from suicidal thoughts but do not wish to die. I feel as though my psyche is split between the overly rational side of me and the extremely lonely and ‘depressed’ version of me. 

I feel as though no one actually likes me, and they just put up with me at school because they are essentially forced to be with me. They appear to be nice to me, but I know for a fact that they will refuse to invite me even when my entire friend group is out and about. 

The reason why I hesitate in actually getting help, is due to the fact that I have no reason to feel this way. My extremely fortunate upbringing and physical appearance, should mean that I should be happy by all accounts. I just no longer know what I can do.

Just linking back to the reckless drinking. Reckless and self endangering behavior is also something I have come to notice in my behavior. I simply do not care for my personal safety at times nor do I feel any sense of care towards other individuals if I do not regard them as friends. 

All of this has led me to be rather lost and unsure what to do. Any and all input is appreciated.

119,"I’ve literally never known a healthy functional person. Everyone in my family, all my close friends, struggle with serious mental health issues. When I talk to my mum about my friends, she gets on me to find and build more healthy relationships, and I’m always like, how?? I’m not well, they’re not well, but we’re doing our best. She’s not well either, or our relationship wouldn’t be such a mess. A lot of my friends knew each other before me, but weren’t introduced to be through each other, we met on our own and were surprised to find we already knew each other’s friends. Are we all attracting the crazy to ourselves, or is there a genuine shortage of healthy people?

120,"On Wednesday I was taken to an emergency room by police for suicidal thoughts. I sat there for 6 hours waiting to be admitted to psych, and then was transferred by police. It was involuntary ""emergency detainment"", and I was told I would have to attend court and be hospitalized for no more than 72 hours. 

I was in the hospital for about a day when they asked for my insurance card. A few hours later they said my insurance wouldn't cover my stay and I needed to leave. 

They changed my admission from ""involuntary"" to ""voluntary"" status so that I could sign myself out. I expressed that I didn't feel ready to leave, and they said they could look into transferring me to a different in-network hospital. I decided to go home and try to make it though the weekend.

How is that legal or ok? Am I going to get a huge bill for being involuntarily brought to an out-of-network hospital? Why didn't the ER put me somewhere in network so I wouldn't get kick out? Why are finances more important than my life?

121,"(New to the subreddit so stick with me)
I’ve been going through a bit of a stressful adjustment to high school (Not a freshman) but my classes seem to just be very demanding, especially my English class (PAP which I’m about to drop) 
But recently and over the last 2-3 months, I’ve been declining in self esteem and confidence. This may have to do with playing a very competitive video game, Rainbow six siege, but it may just be what brings myself to the point I get to. I used to be good (some would say) at the game but recently I’ve been declining in skills and whenever I do bad (which is almost every single recurring day) I always end up feeling depressed, sad, disappointed, and I feel like I’m a failure to my own expectations. I’ll start to degrade myself by saying that “I’m garbage, trash, terrible, bottom of the leaderboard” and I start to spiral until I feel so sad and depressed I just lose my emotions for a while. At this moment I just went through a spiral as usual and I feel completely just numb really, My voice is monotone and I don’t feel anything right now. Could this possibly be a mental condition, illness, or just me being too hard on myself which I can’t change",31Aug2019,1
122," I was volunteering with a kid with autism like a month ago, and I might have given him a piggy bak ride or something. My hand came really close to his di\*\*. So immediately my mind was telling me that I was a bad person, I was a molester, etc, even though I knew deep down I didnt even do anything. From that point on I was really nervous volunteering with him, and maintained my distance from him. He always sits down in a corner and reads his book, and his mom always tells me just to read next to him, or play with a soccer ball or something when he reads it. I decided to test the thoughts in my mind, so I threw a ball on his lap like a dozen times, to test if he had any reaction when it his his crotch. Of course I never came into contact with his crotch. He had no reaction, and was very comforatble, so I felt relieved and verified that I never did anything wrong. Then a few weeks later he knocks the door for his mom to come(mom keeps door locked for whatever reason), because he needs to use the restroom. I also pound on the door, and she doesnt even answer. He then scratches his privates for whatever reason, and pees his pants. It didnt strike me at all then, and the session went on normally. A couple days later, it comes into my mind that what if I Was the one who put my hands in his pants, which would have been physically impossible. And the next week I tried to verify it again. He needed to use the bathroom again, and it takes a while for his mom to open the door. Lo and behold, he did the same thing again. He scratches his privates, but this time he didnt pee his pants because his mom came in time. The moment he did that, I verified it was not my hands, but his, as i literally saw him doing that. I even got my phone out and texted myself that it was HIM who did it and not me. That reduced my stress a lot, but I still have OCD and intrusive thoughts to this day about the thought that I could have touches his privates, and it seems so lucid and real. I have no idea why, but I will say I had severe OCD in the past. Thanks for listening.",31Aug2019,1

124,"I'm having one of those rare lucid moments after having a shower for the first time in weeks, so let's see if I can make this as little rambly as possible and get some help. 

I've been struggling with depression, anxiety and eating disorders all my life. I had my bad moments and normal moments, but I was mostly managing and was ok-ish with my life. However, the last job I had (2 years as sysadmin, massive workload, shitty/abusive management, etc) has left me permanently scarred (closest word I can find) 

I was fired in february this year after developing a pretty serious burnout over my last 6-7 months there, and I've been pretty much a blob since then. I was going to give myself some off time to recover before finding something else, but all the mental health issues I had have gotten worse. 

My manageable depression has evolved into a hellscape with constant suicidal thoughts, depressive episodes that come suddenly at the worst possible moment and that have affected some of my friends (as a result of which I've decided to distance myself from them, partially making things worse) and an inability to do absolutely anything at all (used to read 2-3 books a week, climb, code, help non-profits, play games, you name it. Now I can't even get out of the house and even firing up the switch to play feels like a chore); my sporadic anxiety is now a permanent sense of impending doom that makes me hyperventilate at the mere thought of doing anything (haven't filed my taxes, asked for unemployment benefits or searched for another job because just looking at the necessary steps makes me cry); and the occasional periods of mostly harmless binge eating are now incontrollable waves of stuffing myself with everything or not eating anything at all and making me go from 80kg to 110 and then back to 70.

What's worse, I can't even touch computers anymore. In may the laptop I was using broke. I tossed it aside and haven't touched the spare one since then. The times I've had enough mental strength to try I've ended with nausea and panic attacks after turning it on. This means I can't even get my cv printed, not to mention I can't do any job related to my field (I've experience in other fields, but getting a job there would be much much harder) 

In a good day I was having months ago I asked for a psych appointment, which is in march 2020. My savings are dwindling, can't afford a private therapist and I can only afford 2 more months of rent. If I decide to move I have to warn the landlord 1 month in advance, so I have 30 days to find something. I don't see my situation improving anytime soon. If that runs out I'd have to move back to my hometown and stay at a friend's place or my mother's, which would make everything much, much worse than it already is. 

Any suggestions about what could I do? I can't see a way out of this. I'm doing a massive effort to not kill myself because it'd deeply hurt some friends I really care about, but honestly I'm at my limit and I won't be able to hold forever (please spare me the standard hotline or 'it gets batter' replies, those are not helpful). 

Thanks for reading, I'm completely lost so anything at all is appreciated.",31Aug2019,1
125,"Childhood trauma can live on into adulthood. Thank goodness for counseling. I’ve had to come to terms with my father’s inability to admit wrongdoing let alone an apology. My counselor told that because of my past I’m able to do things that I might not be able to do otherwise. Long story, short, a series of events has again put my father in my life’s path (thus therapy) and before he passes I have to be able to forgive him. This being a supportive community from what I’ve seen, I thought I want to share what I said to my father so I can be free. Maybe my words will help someone on a similar path. My forgiving him is not a denial of past transgressions but a way for me to move on. Might delete later. Here it goes. 

I FORGIVE YOU

As long as I am seeing guilt in you I cannot see the innocence in myself. Forgiveness will remove all sense of weakness, strain and fatigue from my mind and will restore my light and power. I forgive you.

I forgive you for never saying “I love you” for I am able to love unconditionally. 

I forgive you for teaching me how to overcome fear (of you) for I have the courage and capacity to step outside my comfort zone, take risks and evolve. 

I forgive you for the frequent beatings for I now have the fortitude to raise a child with autism and its accompanying challenging behaviors using positive reinforcement. 

I forgive you for demonstrating dominance over another for I now speak up for and advocate for those without a voice and cannot stand up for themselves. 

I forgive you for being selfish for I am a caring and giving person. 

I forgive you for never being there for me for it taught me how to be there for others and expect nothing in return. 

I forgive you for never having a conversation with me for I now teach people how to communicate. 

I forgive you for making me feel weak for I am strong in spite of you. 

I forgive you, for my past has helped shape my future self and revealed my purpose as God had intended. 

You no longer have power over me for I have broken free. Forgiving you helps me see God’s light in myself.",31Aug2019,1
126,"I frequently experience inner conflict over my weaknesses and wonder if they are even real, or whether I just want to make excuses for myself, or feel “special”. I wonder whether I truly struggle with executive functioning, or whether I am just lazy and entitled. I ask myself whether I am simply a selfish asshole, or whether I am someone who is just innately inclined to interact with others in ways which run contrary to societal norms. I struggle with whether to think of myself as a whiny prima donna, or whether to think of myself as perceiving the world more intensely. Maybe I can pull myself up by the bootstraps and be an independent, productive, polite person, maybe I can’t.

I often feel like I am somehow adeptly fooling mental health professionals into thinking I am really trying my best to function to the full extent of my ability and tricking them into wanting to blame a lot of my problems on how I am wired rather than my character. I either have some kind of “reverse” impostor syndrome, or am some kind of master manipulator. There is no way to really prove it either way. 

The day when we can prick our fingers or lay in a brain scanner to find these things out will probably come when I am long gone.

My depression and anxiety have definitely been worse in the past, but over this summer it’s been bad enough to the point where I feel emotionally paralyzed and have trouble taking care of myself or being productive with my work.

134,"I don't know. Normally I don't believe in that kind of stuff but it's all too much to be a coincidence. I don't know if this is a delusion or what. I don't know if I fully believe it.

I've had bad luck my entire life. Even my birth was just bad luck - the doctor delivering me screwed up and I needed years of physical therapy which obvious burdened my parents. My mom had PPD. And then growing up everything sucked. I'm developmentally delayed and I was bullied a lot and also abused.

I grew up to be mentally ill and physically ill. The older I get the worse it gets. I was abusive to my ex, I didn't mean to be I just didn't know how to act at the time. And there was more drama with her family to especially with them being homophobic. I had a full ride to my school but lost it due to illness and I'm draining my family's resources. When I was on a dating site I decided to ignore my mental illness that told me this girl I liked didn't like me and to just go for it. So we ended up together and ever since she's had the worst luck non-stop and most of it isn't related to me, although I've ended up in the hospital a lot and she's missed work because of my health issues. The earliest I remember is someone stole her car keys, then work issues. Of course since we live together she has to spend more money, she used to live rent free with her mom. A ton more stuff has come up. Her mule got injured and it cost her a ton of money. I think he's still injured. Then drama with her best friend. Then her cat got diagnosed with heart failure and needed expensive medication. Then she had to spend a ton of money to put him down when it didn't work. While he was alive he wouldn't use the litter box so we need to replace the carpet which we obviously cat afford. We have a hole in a kitchen window somehow, maybe a gunshot, we don't know. My own cat has fleas and the vet appointment was unaffordable, them she got sick from the treatment, I still can't afford the rest of the treatment and it seems she might have worms now as I spotted one hanging out around her butt. She won't take her hairball gel and honestly I think she needs more vet visits for her nausea issues and I'm so tired. I have the worst luck with medical professionals always, brand new therapist cancelled my appointment the first day without even telling anyone. My girlfriend's car was having issues and it cost her a lot of money to get it ""fixed."" Then it really broke and cost her way more money that she doesn't have, and it's STILL having issues. And today our goddamn washer broke and I have no clean clothes :))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))) Landlord is acting like it's not his responsibility and that his former tenants just left it and he knew we didn't have one so he just ""gave"" them to us.
