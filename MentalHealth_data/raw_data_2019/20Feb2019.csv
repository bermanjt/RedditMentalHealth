0,"(Hey. I have anxiety and likely depression and gender dysphoria. Been to counselling and will see a psychotherapist soon, but this is unrelated to that! I think.)

My personality often changes - or rather, my traits switch? The personas are mostly heavily based off fictive characters I like and identity with (I don’t think I am them) and can be triggered by getting back into a show featuring said characters or music I associate with them.

I look at analysis’s and mood-boards of the characters and do go for their vibe consciously but the switches between characters/personalities (the desire to do this, and the random “oh, I really vibe with X now” is accidental.
I embody their traits and aesthetic (colour themes/fashion), and communicate with people online who identify AS (they think they ARE the characters, unlike me. I know nobody in between these people vs regular fans and feel alone) fictives from the same franchise to satisfy my need to be fully like whoever I like at the time.

I’m 17, been doing it since I was 2. I do not have amnesia, understand I’m not actually these characters and only change my personality traits. My traits don’t speak to each other or anything like people with DID, it’s just pretty odd? These characters are pretty different from one another and sometimes people in my immediate family notice this.
I change my name to be similar to the character and start new social media’s up for myself. One time I had intimate reactions with somebody but switched and he thought I had a whole different name so I kinda just ran away, oof???",20Feb2019,1
1,"Hey guys!

I have needed help for some time and finally got myself in the door somewhere. I had my first session today and my therapist had my first psychiatrist's appointment moved up to tomorrow morning instead of March 8th. I've been told I've been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (which isn't surprising to me) as well as some form of anxiety and I think a couple other things but I can't remember off the top of my head (and she seemed a bit confused about some details in my thing so I think there'll be a bit more exploration done to decide my full diagnosis) and am wondering what to expect at tomorrow's appointment.

Thank you!",20Feb2019,1
2,"Well let me start by saying that I'm not a native English speaker please don't mind some mistakes here and there or lack of expressing what I mean.

I'm 24 male . my problem is that I've NEVER EVER felt any sad emotions about someone dying or getting really sick even if that person is one of my friends or family. 
My parents dyed last year one month apart.  
I DIDN'T FEEL A THING!! even though I loved them more than any thing in the world.  I would've easily give my life for them without even thinking. 

my best friend was killed in 2013 .. my gf got into car accident broke her leg few weeks back
and many different events were normal people should feel bad or at least show any type of emotions like feeling  sad, loss ,pain , sympathy, shock.  
I have never felt any of that when someone had a bad luck in life .

recently my sister pointed out this disconnection with my feelings and I have been feeling pretty guilty about it  , for the first  time in a very long time I feel something hurtful like this guilt..but I don't know how to train my self to feel these emotions. 

I promise I'm not a psychopath ""even though that what a psychopath would say"" I'm a normal guy with pretty average life with the ups and downs. 

please tell me if you have any sort of advice on what I should do or how to stop feeling guilty. 
Thank you for your time and help.",20Feb2019,5
3,"This is especially stupid, since I am an independent adult, don't rely on other people, work, go to university and do well... 
But I still feel like my existence is not justified. 
Like I take a space away from a person who is not sick like me. Someone who is """"""""worthier"""""""". 
Noone wants an autistic, adhd, depressed piece of shit with tourettes. 
Especially Tourettes. I don't even insult people, just make some weird movements and noises, but it is so humiliating to not being able to control it.

4,"Hi. I legit feel like I'm going out of my mind. I feel like everyone is against me. I feel like I am in an experiment thrown into the world while everyone else is just programmed to work a certain way. I am paranoid, I am scared to share my personal information online, I am even afraid to put profile picture on facebook where I literally only have like 150 friends. Speaking of which I don't really have any.. I've lost my two friends 6 years ago and I guess never found anyone. My parents are a mess. The best way I can describe you this feeling is, you know those movies in which a person is set up to look like they killed someone but they didn't and nobody trusts them. Or like one of those movies where things happen even if they are physicaly imposibble just to make main character suffer more and it seems like they can't escape from it? That's how I feel. My mind feels heavy, I can't concentrate in class, My eyes feel heavy as if I'm constantly having vignette effect on them. I can't sleep at night, right now it's 1am and I have a test tomorrow, my memory is worse and worse by day... I just feel like I shouldn't be. Just that. Like I don't belong in my body, like I was missplaced and was accidentally put in the wrong body. Please give me an opinion or something im going crazy.",20Feb2019,2
5,"I realized a lot of my problems are deeply rooted in something so meaningless, something I always thought I was above. I have started truly disconnecting from my trauma at about 13. At 13 I stopped fighting to live and went numb. At that time I was also taken away from my family and put into foster care, which is where my mental problems really imploded. I stopped reaching out to my family, connecting to people, and begging for my parents acceptance. 

As I grew, however, I started trying to heal. I learned more of course, and started noticing my toxic behavior. I started searching my soul and asking questions. Questions to my therapist, questions to my friends, and (most results) questions here. I talked about my sexual abuse that I had locked away and never talked about. I really examined my thoughts, looking for an answer to all my behaviors. And finally, as I sit here pondering, I found out how devastatingly human I really am. 

My whole issue, all of my depression and longing pain is all linked to one thing. 

I'm homesick. 

It sounds stupid but even admitting it makes me want to cry. I feel like a child begging for my mom to touch me. My dad to stay home for the night. Someone to notice me, to hold me. 

I find myself also begging for the acceptance of my partners and friends. I never feel at home, or feel safe. I change myself over and over again, looking for some sort of comfort. And I realized I just missed my fucking parents. 

I'm more broken over this than anything else. My parents hurt me in so many ways and I just want to grow up. Get passed that little girl inside me begging to be held or fed or taken care of. 

I need to heal and I dont know how. ",20Feb2019,2

7,"I have had a very Catholic upbringing, and I have not been very expressive with my feelings. My father has been mentally and physically abusive to me since I was very young. I always have hid my feelings of how I’ve felt depressed and anxious from everyone close to me, to the point where I feel psychotic and like im living a “false” life. My girlfriend of 6 months noticed these feelings I’ve been having, and told me that the best course of action was to tell my parents. 

Every time I’m not in a safe space (with my gf or at my apartment) I feel these growing feelings to go back to one of those safe spaces. When I am in my safe space, I feel like such a failure, because I don’t do anything, and I just lay on the couch binge watching a show or watching YouTube on my phone till 2-3 am. I frequently forget to shower, eat, and brush my teeth, I just dont think about it, but when I do, I feel absolutely disgusted with myself. My clean clothes have been in a basket for a week now, and I cant bring myself to even fold them.. 

I just mustered up the courage to tell my parents about how I’ve been feeling depressed/anxious, and about my psychotic episodes, but they just said that it was because I vaped and totally wrote it off as nothing because they think im just a lazy person who can do better. But I know that I can do better, I just cant physically push myself to get better. I saw a psychiatrist in high school, and I actively avoided going almost every time I had a scheduled appointment. 

I have recently had episodes of slight psychosis (not feeling like my thoughts are mine/talking to those thoughts) When I get these thoughts, I bash my head on anything that is close to me, and I have many bumps on my head because of this... I have also had major anger episodes where I lash back at my dad physically for a rude comment he made in my direction or if he told me that I dont matter/not doing my best. I dont know what to do, and I dont know if what im feeling is normal at all.. it surely doesn’t seem normal.

8,"Hello everyone,
I’m sure some of you can relate to what I’m about to say. I can’t hold a job, I mean, I know I can but I’m having a very hard time. I quit a job I was at for a year and a half. That was 3 months ago, since then I’ve been through 6 jobs now. 

On the last one I made it to day 3 and quit the next day. I’ve been on medication the past 2.5 months. I’m not sure if it has started to work, doesn’t feel like it because I still get really anxious. I have no choice but to do food delivery for right now. 

1st job was a tree groundsman
2nd another dog bathing job (it was alot different than I was used to and the owner wasn’t very polite). 

3rd job was another bathing job, but during my interview I was told I’d be making $3/hr more than what I was actually going to make. The owner informed me of my actual wage and I dipped out. 

I could go on, but I want to get to the point. Does anyone know of other good jobs for people with severe depression and anxiety? I may just look for a part-time job and still continue to do deliveries, and then build from there. I have a fiancé that I love too much to lose and I want to do everything I can to make sure we stay together.

9,"I say _flaws_ knowing that in our head, they are exaggerated. I want to know how you're coping with dysmorphia. I.e, how you're taking the step to ""ignore"" your reflection.

How you deal with it in public. What do you do with all those compiling insecurities? Or just really. Where do you go from there.

10,"Hi, first-time Reddit user here. 

I discovered this forum, and was hoping to get some input or advice about my mental health. 

I apologize in advance for how long it is.

I've always been kind of weird. Not in an insane, biting-other-children-in-kindergarten type of way, but more so in a dark humor and twisted inside jokes kind of way. But I'm really only like that with my friends, who share a similar sense of humor, and otherwise am just a normal person. 

But lately, I've noticed that I've been surprising myself with how strange I act.

I've always had very low self-esteem, and have suffered from pretty bad depression and eating disorders up until pretty recently, but am doing pretty fine in those aspects now. 

But now I've just been acting straight-up fooking insane. 

I find myself panicking and worrying over every little thing. The tiniest problems set me off, and I immediately start crying, shaking, hitting myself for being so retarded, and get so incredibly angry at my own incompetence. 

I will admit that I have high expectations for myself, and get very angry at myself whenever I slip up or make an error, no matter how small. 

For example, I recently accidentally cracked my iPad, and when it happened, I just froze and just sat there for about a minute. I was pretty swamped, and focused on my homework, when I moved my arm and accidentally knocked it off of its stand and it hit my windowsill, and cracked. I started crying and got so incredibly angry at myself, I automatically started punching and slapping myself, calling myself a ""retard and a f\*cking idiot,"" and thought how I didn't deserve anything nice because I always end up ruining it. I then crawled under my desk and curled up into fetal position, and just cried while cursing myself.    

I also will sometimes see my reflection in my laptop screen or whatever, and just start saying the most hateful things to it, and it goes on for quite a while. I tell my reflection how I'm a f\*cking failure, an overweight pig, untalented, sub-par in every aspect, etc... I'll just sit there, talking out loud to my reflection like it's another person.

I also do this weird thing where whenever I get all panicky, I'll just go straight to the kitchen and throw away food. Sometimes I'll cut it up into little pieces, or just organize the food, or just open the packaging and stare at it, but I never eat it, and I tell myself I don't deserve the food. I force myself to watch the food, deny myself any of it because I'm too disgusting to eat, and throw it away. 

I honestly don't know why I'm acting so crazy and weird lately, and it scares me. 

I'm pretty young, and I'm still in school, so I don't think it has to do with anything like old age.

None of my friends, even my closest ones, know about this because I don't even know how to begin explaining it to them when I don't even understand it myself. I feel like I'm going insane and I don't now what to do.",20Feb2019,1

26,"Throwaway account and kinda rambly. I'm a high school student who has depression and anxiety that swing from being debilitating to bearable, among other disorders that don't really stop me from doing everyday things, but definitely get in the way. I've come some distance and a lot has happened in the last few years with my mental health, but right now I'm struggling and deciding on what to do next. I have a rambling list of things I've been thinking about doing about it, and would like some thoughts:



- to keep staying on meds and hope they eventually work. My doctor and I have been trying to find a good med and dose for awhile, and this is probably the one most people will point to. I am going to stay on my meds, but my grades are taking a massive hit while I try and find something that works and I take my academics very seriously. This option would be only sticking to my meds and nothing else.



- take a reduced courseload. My academic counselor suggested this, and though I have no desire to, considering I know I'm smart enough to do more courses than usual without the mental illness, my parents and teachers seem to be heavily considering officially recommending it, considering my last report card barely squeezed out honours and it more or less nearly drove me mad. I know it might be a good idea for while I try and stabilize, but I really don't want to if possible. My courses would drop from 8 a year to 6 or 7.



- try and find a therapy that works better for me. This probably seems like it should be the first step,  but I went to therapy for years before deciding to drop it to save money for a little bit while I recovered from my mental state dropping to an all time low. I've been attending sporadically when I can, but the strategies and things I'm being taught are either already things I've tried or am trying and are not working in this situation. I know there are other types of therapies out there I could try, including those that aren't just sitting and talking and learning, but it's expensive and I don't know if it would help me when I'm doing this poorly. I know that seems dumb to some, but going to sessions has never helped me when I'm at my absolute worst, because I can't really use the sessions to help myself at the time, and a lot of the things I already know from the people close to me who were or are therapists.



- look into a support animal. The responsibility of an animal being mine alongside a dog being able to break repeating actions or interrupt actions or emotions leading to an anxiety attack or breakdown might be something that would aid me a lot, but I'm not ready to bring it up with my parents unless it's an option that might actually improve my state enough for it to be worth the investment for them. While I know it would help to an extent, I still live with and off my family, and would never suggest it if the cons would outweigh the pros for them and us as a household.


TLDR I'm not sure if I'm improving at a rate and in a way that is efficient, and am wondering if I should just wait it out with what I'm doing now, reduce my school courses, look for therapies I haven't tried or look into a support animal. If anyone has any other suggestions I'm up for it. Sorry for the long post.",20Feb2019,1
27,"I currently take a SSRI for depression and I have seen a vast improvement in my overall mental health since starting it a year ago. However I have a few concerns. 

1) I think I may need to up my dose but I’m afraid that doing so is just me trying to “throw pills at the problem” instead of dealing with my issues. 
2) When I started with my psychiatrist I really liked them but it’s like they’ve become more and more busy and I don’t feel like I’m get any kind of personalized care. Is this something I should bring up to them or should I just look for a different office?

35,"Okay this is a question as I’m sure I am not the only one going through this. 

On the outside, I am a eloquent, intelligent and charming individual. My friends and colleagues have even gone as far as to say I’m a creative genius. They all think I have my shit together. 

Here’s the thing, I don’t have anything together. Not my health, not my finances or even my blossoming career. I always feel like I am juggling so much mentally, which I am. But my juggle has never been effective. My life has been one of very high ups and really low downs. 

I try to schedule my week ahead of time. I set reminders (I forget a lot of things) but I often miss emails and messages from work and friends because you know, depressed. Incredible people want to be my friend because they think I’m incredible but they quite frankly wear me out. I commit to projects I don’t finish. I have distanced myself from family and friends are starting to stop calling. 

I know exactly what to do with my finances and I often budget ahead of time. I use Mint and excel sheets and I may be going good for like a couple of months but then I get depressed and everything goes to shit. It happens every fucking time! I recognize it. I have changed strategy multiple times. I have put processes in place to stop me from binge eating, which essentially throws my budget and weight out of wack every time. 

Like the man in me is trying so fucking hard to be this person that I know I can be in my career, to my sisters who I continue to hurt and to incredible mentors and strangers who continue to push me to live my best life. 

But I fucking can’t. I try so hard but I am so bad at adulting. It’s weird because you wouldn’t have a clue if you ever meet me. I know I can forgo the intense focus I put on my health or finances and relationships to just go for it and execute my ideas but I know I’ll most likely end up dead because I’m an obsessive who works himself till I’m falling asleep on the steering wheel driving 95mph back home because I fucking stayed at work till 2am.

I am currently smoking CBD mixed with thc after a opiate and coc relapse during this weekend fling I had with my ex where I found out she slept with three other men. I do those hard drugs cause it makes me last longer in bed, she doesn't do the drugs but doesn't stop me when I do em cause she prefers the sex.

37,"First of all, I have no clothes to wear. This is because I don’t like any of the clothes in the store. So now I’m stuck wearing clothes that are really old and too small for my body since I have outgrown it. I used to love shopping and fashion. But now every time I see clothes I think that it looks bad. I have been to so many stores and I walk out empty-handed every time.

I don’t like most new songs. Another thing is that I don’t like Snapchat. I have seen what my classmates' Snaps are like. They have pictures of themselves with poor lighting and dumb filters, their weed and bong, and their Doritos and Takis. Why would I want to see these things. I don’t know why people like it. When I was in high school, one of my classmates kept asking me to download Snapchat and add him. I never did it. 

I don’t like any of the TV shows right now.  Also, I haven’t seen a movie in the theater since 5 years ago. None of the movies appeal to me. The thing is, I used to love going to the movie theater. Movies at home don’t appeal to me either, I haven’t enjoyed watching a movie in years.

It's not just these things, I don't want to make this post too long, but I really don't like anything new at all, no matter what the category is.

It may seem like I am just listing things and ranting, but I am unhappy because I can’t enjoy anything, and this concerns me. I just want to enjoy things again, but I don’t know how. I keep listening to old music that I am tired of because I can’t like new music. As I said before I wear clothes that are extremely small (I have grown about 4 inches since the last time I bought new clothes). My clothes are also worn out and falling apart. I keep looking through my old magazines from 2009 and feeling sad that our society isn’t like that anymore. What can I do to enjoy these things that everyone else is enjoying? 

Is there something that I can do? For example, maybe I should buy some clothes, even though I think it’s ugly, and force myself to wear it for a month? I don’t know. I have actually tried to buy an off-the-shoulder top and I still haven't taken the tags off. I also tried to wear a shirt that I bought last year and I would wear it for about 5 minutes before changing back into an old shirt, and repeating that process 3 times and not wearing it in the end. I couldn't stand to wear it, it made me irrationally uncomfortable. 

I actually used to be really into all of the new songs, new movies, etc. and I knew about all of the trends and really liked it. Now I don’t like anything.",20Feb2019,3
38,"So I tend to be nostalgic at times, I've made so many memories with so many people in the past 21 years of my life that I often hold on to the good times and long for them, such as the good laughs I had back in my high-schools days with my friends, the moments I hung out with my closest friends, the good times I spent with my family, etc. I treasure the past, but I also tend to hold on to things that aren't really good for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Back in late 2017, I was 19 years old and I developed a strong crush on a girl who I was sort of friends with but I never really got to spend much time with. After a couple of hangouts and having felt some sort of strong connection between the both of us, I mustered up the courage to ask her out on a date, she said ""Maybe"" which left me struck with so much doubt, wonder, and anxiety in me that lasted months. We still talked afterwards but due to the big elephant in the room our conversations decreased as she would purposely read and not respond to my messages which left me with even more sadness leaving me in a position of un-reciprocated effort for communication.

I developed some sort of depression and anxiety-induced obsession about what she actually meant at the time and this went on for a month or so.

&amp;#x200B;

Ironically and weirdly enough, we actually started talking again after a month of awkward silence, then dated and formed a relationship that lasted several months before we broke up in mid-late-2018. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now it's 2019, and somehow I have some sort of nostalgia longing for that anxiety that I felt of her. I long for all the places I went to where I had these anxious, depressive, and obsessive thoughts that she left with me at the time. This nostalgia is not like I want to relive those days, but kind of like ""Ah the good times..."". Like a nostalgia for once un-reciprocated romantic interest, when there's nothing good that came of it, despite the temporary happiness of a relationship that she and I formed.

Any thoughts?",20Feb2019,2
39,"Dear Reddit 
I don’t really know how to start this, but this seamed like the best place to do it. My life is a little stressful atm and sharing has always helped me, so I decided that instead of dumping my life on a friend (someone on the same corse so under similar stresses)  I would just put it out into  the world. 
So introduction over; time for the life overview! Simply put my older sister (a role model to me and an image of strength) had depression and then a psychotic break, it really tore me up, currently exploring drugs it just pushed me towards it( to early(~17)). In a positive view of the situation it drew the family together, as she jumped threw a window (for logically no reason, even in a sympathetic view to health problems) it was clear she was ill. Moving to a more personal note the following summer i had a break myself, mainly fuelled by a lack of an objectives coming out of some intense subjects and an unhealthy amount of drugs ( Hallucinogenic‘s, dissociative{namely ketamine}, and stimulants and; the classic weed)  made it so bad festivals and times of relaxation became peak times for anxiety and neurotic episodes. By this point I knew it was at least partly genetic, my mother was originally the nut of the household trio, me, my mum, and sister. 
Then sister thing. 
And that leads me to get a therapist possibly one of the best things to happened to me, he was based in cbt and spent half of his sessions doing deep meditation allowing the sub-conscious to really step to the front. Those lessons have been a serious pillar in my day to day life. And from then it had been a supported and educated  journey with so much support😭😭😭 can’t describe the time when my mum told me my best friend came to my house and asked my mum if I was genuinely alright, was to much. Bad multiple friends crying about taking to friends about talking to there own parents  
And crying about being worried about me. {post rant: was crying myself a lot at this point} After saying all that it seems a bit attention seeking. Any ways things continue with a general trend of improvement  and then they leads to where I am now, recently I have been dealing with my problems with getting black out drunk and taking ridiculous amounts of ket when I can.
 And it’s just came to a point with a month till exams I’ve been lonely and overshared like a big wave, haven’t had the next yet I’ll have to get my head down like now......

 any ways; first thank you for read this. I’m sure I have lots more to say  so if your interested in tagging along I will continue posting with updates and such. 

And to anyone who relates remember the best thing is you are alive and you have a chance to turn things around no matter how deep in it you are and even if life just feels like suffering it will get better at least bearable, ask for help if not a professional the community you are in right now. Humans are hard wired to help those in need do not be afraid to ask for help.

I can't even study well anymore and I just don't seem to have a drive to accomplish things anymore. Even if I try to fight it for awhile, laziness or apathy keep seeming to pop up again.

I have a slew of mental health issues. I was institutionalized as a child for a short time. I also had a mental breakdown in 2014 and never fully recovered. Held a loaded gun to my head on multiple occasions. I struggle with self-harm, marijuana dependence, alcohol, and excoriation. I have had over ten jobs in the last two years. I am finally in a decent employment position, but I feel it may be beyond my capabilities because of my conditions. I have no real support, no friends, no family that would even begin to understand. All I have is an alcoholic boyfriend of 5 years that is dealing with his own shit. I’ve been in a constant state of dissociation since I was about 12. As a result, I barely feel like any time has passed and don’t remember most of the last 10 years or so. I have no idea who I am compared to who I pretended to be in high school and my early 20s to get by. I keep trying to find a reason to want to stay confined to this body with a broken mind, but keep falling short. Up until late last year, I was ready to die by any means necessary. I would wish for cancer. I had no care for my life so I would get into cars with friends who liked going 90 down the road in races with other drivers. I would stay out all night and drink and do drugs, not as an escapism technique, but in hopes I would black out forever each time. I’ve been in the hospital for a kidney infection due to dehydration. I often go days without eating or by just drinking juice. I honestly don’t think I will make it to 30 at this rate. Does anyone else feel similar? ",20Feb2019,3

45,"To give context, I consider myself a relatively normal person, I'm not on any drugs or involved with crime. 

I'm not writing this for advice, I'm only writing this to see if other people feel the same 

I do this thing a lot where I get it in my head that someone is observing or just judging my actions. I know nobody is, and it's not a real paranoia, I just start acting like people are watching me. It's definitely strong enough that it affects my actions too. Even though I am totally sane and know nobody is actually going to judge me, I imagine their presence and act as though someone is looking at me behind my back.

I've also just realized recently that I have these very realistic conversations with myself. I never really realized until now, I just did it. It's never really been an actual voice, but when I do, I lose track of literally everything. I am so deep in my head that these conversations just kind of consume me. They're about a lot of things, mostly social interactions 

I consider myself very lonely too. I cant say I've had a close friend since second grade (I'm in college). Generaly I think I've gotten it in my head that I just don't want to have friends because I'm so uncomfortable around people due to my anxiety, but part of it is just a cynisism for people. I say this because these conversations or feelings that someone is watching me tend to lead to my loneliness. I get so in my head that I feel depressed and lonely.

I used to be suicidal, but now I feel like I've passed that low. I've reached the stage where I just know that to be totally technical and honest, life really doesnt mean anything. I mean to have meaning is a stupid phrase because if  you invent meaning, there has to be something more. if you find ""meaning"", you just ask, well... why? And then you need to redefine ""meaning"". So I don't really care much for life anymore and ironically that actually got me out of suicidal thoughts. Now I just feel so unbelievably lonely and isolated (I would never blame other people though, this is of my own doing)

I guess my question is, am I normal? Do other people feel like this. I feel so disconnected from the world. I feel like everybody is different. Do other people have these thoughts. I'm not really asking for advice on my depression or loneliness, that's not really what a redit thread is for. I'm only asking if anybody else feels the same way.",20Feb2019,1
46,"Hi my name is Phillip, I am 22 years old. I was raised Catholic and my dad is very dedicated to his faith. My family and I go to church every Sunday and I also pray daily. I believe in Demons and an exorcist wrote in his book that there are only demons and angels that roam the earth, also I believe him since he is a catholic exorcist priest so I'm not entirely sure if I believe that human spirits also roam as well. Anyways, I believe I have also experienced evil spirits (Demons) present with me, I cannot see them or touch them but I believe I've felt there presence in reality. For example, when I was mowing my backyard today I felt like something was there with me like something supernatural and like I was being watched or something. It does make you feel stressed and uncomfortable and I'm just wondering if it's a demon or it's just all in my head. Not to mention I am suffering from depression, social anxiety,paranoia in public, and auditory hallucinations from Butane hash oil which is concentrated Marijuana. I smoked heavily from about 6 to 12 months and my hallucinations started after I took a large amount of wax(concentrated Marijuana)and which I was hearing loud demonic roars. I hear sounds not voices which I hear from video games, movies, and different sound effects that play in a loop. I also quite often hear demonic growls like a roaring demon. But I think I may have tinnitus because I hear constant ringing in my ears. Is this a demon? Or is it just tinnitus? Schizophrenia does run on my dad's side of the family so I'm not completely sure… I'm just confused about what's going on with me. I also experience constant dissociation. Sorry I know this is very long but I'm seeking freedom.

49,"Hey guys, I've never been diagnosed with any mental health issues, and growing up, I never even considered that these things could affect me. I'm currently in my 4th year of college, and I'm starting to piece together some things after a friend made an off-handed comment to me. 

We were studying for an exam, and I was having trouble focusing as I always do. When I study, I pay attention for the first few minutes, and then get on my phone for 10-15 minutes. Very inefficient, but I get bored easily, and I have no self control. We were taking turns reading and deciphering PowerPoint slides, and it was my turn. Of course, I wasn't paying attention, so he joked and said I have ADHD.

I took his comment as gospel, and I began to recollect on some things. I constantly have nervous energy. I cannot sit down without shaking my leg or moving around in some way. My memory is absolutely terrible - short and long term. Sometimes, I'll do things and have no memory of it ten seconds later. Things like setting down my phone or my keys and then not being able to find them immediately. When I leave for class, I always get in my car and then forget if I locked the door or turned the oven/stove off (even when I hadn't cooked anything). Countless times, I've had to turn around when I was halfway to class because of this worry.

Thinking back, these traits are playing a bigger role in my life than I considered. I always doubted that I have Adhd, because I've never been the talkative type. I just never have anything to say. Also, I don't have much trouble learning new things, if I could just remain focused for long enough.

I don't know if maybe I'm overreacting or not. However, it seems that some of these characteristics are detrimental to my daily life. I'm not sure who I should talk to - therapist or psychiatrist, or no one at all. As a broke college student, I'm not sure if I should even make it a priority.

Sorry for the long ramble. This really helped me assemble my thoughts, even if my post may seem disjointed. I'd appreciate any advice.",20Feb2019,1
50,"I’m 15 and see things and hear things that aren’t real. I don’t have much memory of my childhood but I remember the things that were pretty traumatic . I was living in Ireland at the time and we lived right outside our town only like a 20 min walk into town .

One of the fucked up things I remember is my mother tried to scare me to not go outside and to not go on walks this is when I was really young 6,7,8 of 9 not really sure but my mom told me if I left the house without her permission a black van will pick me up and they will rape me and beat me until I die .

So needless to say I didint go outside but as time moved on I turned into a bad kid she’d kept me locked away from the real world so much I didint know anything about these knew things so I started smoking weed and selling drugs and fighting with knives and shit like that .

My mom got sick of me coming home smelling like weed or with blood on me or picking me up from the council houses (which she used to live in but as soon as my dad came along and took her out of the flats she thinks she’s better then them) . So she stopped me, she’d lock me in the house and not let me leave . Sometimes she wouldn’t let me eat or drink anything and she’d wait until I started crying with hunger to do anything some of those days I got sick of it and I’d wait until she unlocked the door for a sec or find an unlocked window and sprint out of the door and run into town to buy food .

She would call the police on me and say that I ran away or something like that and when I told the police she wasn’t letting me eat or drink they didint believe me she lied to them .

Then she found a gun in my room . And I was 14 at the time . She would constantly search my room take out all the drawers, look under everything etc . I was just terrified of her that I had to have something to protect myself I couldn’t just take one of her knives I had self harmed in the past so she was always checking if I took her razors or knives.

Then she started putting me in foster care as a punishment for running away once the police arrested me for running away she’d tell them that I’ve threatened her with knives and with violence and that she would not feel safe with me at home .

Just before she put me in care I was kicked outta my school because I was fighting and caught with alcohol that I robbed from the shop beside school. So a few weeks later I was put into a school in the country side. I haven’t mentioned that I loved school I got to be out of school and be with my friends and it was amazing loads of dumb teenage stupid shit everyday I got to be an actual kid.

But this other school I got moved too was different I started having visual and audio delusions and made myself to push myself away from people. Countless nights in foster homes being scared of the people their but I kept up a thuggish look so nobody fucked with me .

So my mom thought she had the perfect plan everything was going perfect she got to fuck with my mental  health and physical health and fuck with my dad . Whenever my dad pissed off my mom she’d use me as revenge she would put me in foster care to piss him off because he cared about me unlike her .

My father was in England and i would only see him every few months for the last year or two since I had delusions . But my mom didint factor in him fucking up her plans . She forgot he got joint custody in court after they split up when I was 3 sooooo he went to Ireland and signed a few forms to gain full ownership of me since my mom gave her custody away when I was in care .

Ended up just hugging and crying with my dad when I seen him and once I was in his car driving away I was so fucking happy but sad I was leaving my friends in Ireland but happy I was away from my mother.

I now live in England and it’s better but not at the same time I can do whatever I want really and I’ve been taken out of school for mental health reasons . I haven’t made a single friend even though I’ve been here for a year I don’t leave the house ever barely ever leave my room really . I think her making me scared of everyone and everything besides her has really fucked me up in the long term. I’ve got crazy anxiety when I’m outside but I’m trying to learn to live with it . I struggle with suicide and depression a lot. I have no friends I literally do nothing all day besides sleep eat and drink. I have the feeling of being a burden on my dad since we have no money and are getting evicted this month if I killed myself he’d have more money so less shit to worry about .

I’m here because I don’t know who else to ask. Back story : me and my girlfriend have been together for around 8 months now. Both suffer from separate mental illnesses.

So recently Me and my girlfriend have been struggling with coping with our illnesses since we met. It’s been great and she’s the first person I’ve felt I’ve ever loved but the issue is that we both find it extremely hard to cope with when we both have our struggles. My girlfriend is getting worse and so am I. I’m under the assumption that maybe us being together isn’t working due to the fact that we may be too sick to be in a relationship. I feel that I’m too sick to be able to give her the proper relationship she needs and vice versa. She recently attempted suicide again and without being selfish it’s something that’s so hard to deal with when you yourself have a mental illness. I’m thinking of having us break up as I don’t believe either of us can get better whilst were too busy trying to fix each other. I really don’t know what’s best, any advice is welcome. Thank you all ",20Feb2019,1
57,"I’m in the uk, I’m 17, female. 

I was wondering if I could tell my gp that I tried to commit suicide twice in the past. The thing is, I don’t want this getting back to my family or my social workers. 

About two years ago, I tried to commit suicide twice by overdosing on a cocktail of dihydrocodiene, alcohol, ibuprofen and mirtazipine, the second time I just took about 9 grams of paracetamol (I read that between 4-7 would be fatal), I wasn’t thinking straight. I’ve had a blood test recently and my kidney functioning is good, I’m not sure about my liver, but I suspect after 2 years that I’m okay. 

On my last appointment with my doctor, I didn’t tell her the truth because I was scared, I’m not suicidal anymore but I’m still scared of telling her. What will the consequences be of telling my gp? My mental health has got worse, so I really want to tell the truth to actually get help after all these years of holding it in. ",20Feb2019,1

However every time it turns dark, once I am left all alone again, even if I am with people (I know it sounds weird but it’s how I feel)that I would consider family or friends. I cannot shake the feeling of nothing and at the same time I cannot stop myself from wanting to crawl down and just cry. To give up and stop fighting. 

It is now 2:10 in the morning. This is my third time that I cannot sleep no matter how I tried for the last two weeks.

59,"My psychotherapist, whom I've been seeing for the last 5 years, finally gave up on me yesterday. He's the 10th or 11th I've had through all these years of struggling with bipolar depression. ""We've hit a wall...I'm sorry but it would be remiss of me as a doctor if I let you keep coming back here when it seems I'm not helping you anymore..I really want you to get better..I empathize with you..and we've done all we could.."" I was crying uncontrollably as he was saying this. My heart just felt so heavy. We've both considered ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) as the last recourse but we both know my family can't afford it.  He's endorsed me to a colleague of his but I'm not sure I'll go see her. It's another cycle again. I am so tired. I stepped out of my therapist's clinic crying like a baby and I wish someone was there with me for me to cry on. It was so emotionally draining I just felt so weak and sleepy I lay down on the rows of chairs in the waiting area. 

The thought of everyone giving up on me is the scariest. I'm at the brink of giving up on myself, if I haven't yet.. 17 years of depression and the only thing stopping me from doing what i think is the most logical thing to do is the thought of botching it up.

I don't know what to do. :'( ",20Feb2019,107
60,"Hi everyone, I hope this is okay to post on here. I am running the London Marathon this year for a mental health charity in the UK. I wanted to reach out to people that struggle with mental illness as I would love to create a platform through a short online documentary for people to speak out and talk about their struggles. I want to try and run each individual mile for a different person that struggles with some form of mental illness and (if anyone is willing to participate) have each person record a small video piece talking about their struggle. The documentary will be about me running the London Marathon for 26 different people, and I want to include each person's story in the video. I am hoping this might encourage the people that are participating and encourage other people who watch the short documentary piece that I put online to speak out and not stay quiet as well as bring further awareness to just how many people struggle with various forms of mental health. I am happy to provide more information if it's something anyone would like to be a part of, and I can provide some contact details to message me privately. If you don't want to be a part of it I totally understand that as well and my overall aim of running the marathon anyway is to raise money and awareness for anyone that struggles with mental illness so I hope somewhere along the line I can help you anyway.

61,"Hi.

To make a long story short, about 6 years ago I was diagnosed with ADHD combined. This made sense to me at the time; I had a tendency to be easily distracted, procrastination was a huge issue, I always felt jumpy and alert of everything all at one; my anxiety was off the charts. 

However, I've recently started to notice a few different issues: I become emotionally numb the second someone shows a negative emotion, I've been having nightmares (mainly about losing my SO or other family members) as of late, I feel constantly tired and I either fail to sleep or oversleep by several hours, I feel worthless and like a disappointment/failure about 75% of the time (in spite of my SO and family recognizing and hailing my achievements--IE, I'm in a PhD program with a 4.0), I'm constantly on guard and feel like I have to watch my back, in my head I create escape plans in different scenarios that I think up, I have a very difficult time connecting with people I'm not very familiar with and although I seem friendly I am actually screaming inside with my being forced to socially interact with others. 

I have experienced trauma; when I was 12, my best friend tried to take her own life; I was the one who called 9-1-1. At 14, I was raped. At 15 I was in a relationship that lasted for 4 years and was abusive throughout. I was kicked in the head (accident, gym class) and sustained a concussion after blacking out. School aside, my parents tended to use corporal punishment with me lasting through high school (they've since mellowed out). At 20 a different friend attempted suicide and succeeded; for no reason at all I blame myself for their death. I literally cannot talk about it without getting incredibly upset. I've also developed a slight fear of strange dogs as my dog and I were attacked by one two years ago. 

That's a brief summation; I'm sure there's more but that's all I can think of off the top of my head. Right now I just feel kind of numb and tired, but I'm still working on things I procrastinated on and have to finished for later on today so I'm up now. I would just really appreciate some advice or insight from professionals, or those who have ADHD and/or PTSD and can guide me in some way/give me advice. I just feel kind of lost and confused and I'm not sure if what I'm saying sounds accurate or if I'm just overthinking. I'm open to questions and all that if you have any.

Thank you. ",20Feb2019,2

67,"Okay, so I’ll try to keep this as short and precise as possible. 
I’ve struggled mentally for a almost, if not actually my entire life. When I was 15 I realised that my mental issues is mainly related to my family situation which is pretty bad. I got it confirmed again when I moved to Japan almost a year ago, when my panic attacks completely disappeared and when I experienced sadness in my home country, it was always a big part of me that just wanted me to disappear, to die, even though I was past the point of actually thinking that way. I’d worked on myself for a number of years and realised I’d probably just always be like that at that point, but when I moved here, when I was sad, I was just sad. I never felt anxiety here until my dad got diagnosed with cancer (it’s quite serious) and my mom got jealous that I was giving him more attention than her, and when I got confirmed that my grandmother (mom’s side) actually does hate me, and has no love for me. I actually was determined to cut off the mom side of my family after this, and years of trying to please them and just ending up hurting myself, but I didn’t feel like I could make suck a big decision without consulting a professional, but my psychologist never replied... 
I’ve stayed out of touch with my family until now after I visited for Christmas, I just needed a break, and I’ve been feeling fine. But now that I’ve taken it up again, I feel so anxious, and not in a way that feels normal, even though it’s not the “keeps going on for six months and disturbs your everyday life continuously” type, I know (I think) it’ll pass in max a week. I’m used to this. But my symptoms don’t feel like they fit into what I found online etc, and even though I’ve been to psychologists for years, no one has ever really diagnosed me. I think they probably felt like it was better that I focus on overcoming and maybe worried that I’d be swallowed by my diagnosis and just become it. I’m kinda beyond that point now, and I’m in a very different environment, but if I can’t actually pinpoint what I’m experiencing to people in my current situation, it makes it really hard for me kind of. I want my boyfriend and my teachers to know properly kind of. 

So, my symptoms are as follows:
- Normal breathing, but a constant feeling of loss of oxygen
- Numbness and shakiness. My senses are a little lowered, but I can still feel. My hands tend to get kinda shaky, but not necessarily constantly, I’d approximate between 60-90 % of the time, at varying degrees. 
- Loss of motivation and focus (but I make sure to eat, sleep and try to work out) 
- Loss of speech and memory, I struggle with my words and can’t remember simple things. I don’t forget everything, but I can forget things like being hungry, having to use the toilet, things I learned in school 6 months ago and am constantly using (and not as a brain fart for a single thing, I forget a lot of it), and forgetting words when i speak so I struggle to express myself compared to as usual
- Sadness and non talkativeness (is that a word? Haha) My voice gets really lowered and I struggle to speak up at times 
- A lot of times I just want to lay down and cry in the middle of the road

Not experiencing:
- My heart rate is normal, and I’m not feeling scared constantly, which I was when I experienced the attacks before. Don’t know about my heart rate previously, but I did feel like I was dying. However I do feel very easily shaken and scared. 
- I can feel restless, but I don’t have to
- I DEPEND on my 8 hours and I have my entire life, so being unable to sleep is something that doesn’t happen very often, even when something like this happens. It may, but it might as well not

It’s kind of what I’ve always felt as the buildup to a panic attack before, but not the attack itself.   

Im way over my years of mental illness, and I just want to move on. I’m not letting it swallow me, and look forward. 
This doesn’t necessarily happen all the time, but has happened a bit recently due to recent events. But I can definitely say I find this worse than “first day at new school nervousness”, so I’m not sure how this could or would be classified. 
I can’t get a psychologist cause they are too expensive for me here, but I’m doing my best! Thanks a lot in advance ",20Feb2019,1
68,"I was really depressed last year, it was one of the worst years of my life. I was in year 12 in high school, I was self harming pretty badly, I wanted a romantic relationship with my best friend and she rejected me (I know it's so ridiculously stupid to me now). I treated her really badly and I was the one who decided we shouldn't be friends because of me.
 I have apologized to her so many times but I still feel a lot of guilt about what happened. I just can't stop hating myself and I feel disgusting for it. How can I let go of this? ",20Feb2019,1
69,"At the age of 18 I was convicted of DUI. I swore to never drink and drive again. But years later, two years ago I did. I got blackout drunk then drove an hour to my house. 
But something weird happened. Halfway through driving home I fell asleep at the wheel and woke up in the nick of time to swerve out from on coming traffic and nearly collided with another vehicle. 

This is when I died. I can’t prove it but I did. And ever since then I’ve felt off. I spiraled into alcoholism, drug use, flunked out of college, and my most recent act - moved to Hawaii. Moving to Hawaii was a test, really. I’ve lived in the same town for all my life and thought well, my mind can’t create a place I’ve never been to. So I bought a one way ticket and have been in Hawaii for the last month. I thought that the plane would blow up on lift off or something would prevent me from leaving my town but here I am. 

I’ve been sober since Jan 2nd of this year but the feeling still lingers. I don’t know what to do anymore. Sometimes I just want to swim out in the ocean and see how far I can get. ",20Feb2019,0
70,"Long story short, I had some adjustment anxiety 2 years ago when switching jobs and mentioned it to my GP who recommended meds to “cut the edge” and when I’m good I can just get off. I trusted her and we went through Lexapro with no avail. She said let’s try Effexor because it has less side effects and works differently- great! Ended up maxed out, with Remeron added to the Effexor (aka California Rocket Fuel... which is ironic). 

Fast forward, side effects are terrible and things I’ve never experienced or felt happening. 6 times I went back begging bc it’s not working or the side effects. Finally it hits the fan a week and a half ago at work and I just had a meltdown. I had to get off. Called my doctor knowing I am going to do this cold turkey and knowing she’s not going to be happy. But last time she just gave me a refill for a year and said I know by body. Got a note for 2 weeks off work, and ripped it off at 225. The first week was a blur and absolute hell. Vomiting, dizziness, shaking- I felt not much different than a hard drug addict. 

A coworker recommended a wonderful therapist who I see weekly to work through the emotional changes, and he’s absolutely amazing. I feel like I found a friend, confidant, and someone to guide me through all of my anxiety. 6 failed medications. 4 failed therapists. I never thought i would be here today. I cried when i ate for the first time again. I feel good though. Not great, still brain zaps and nausea but I can leave my bed now. 

When this was all happening I was searching for others with a similar experience, because it was intense to say the least. I would love to hear other stories if you have them, and if you have any recommendations to deal with general anxiety minus medication, I’d love to hear them as well :) ",20Feb2019,1

78,"Hey guys. 

I hope you'll be able to help me as many of you understand what I'm going through. Today I had my first session with my therapist and a part of me is extremely happy I finally reached out for help. On the other side I feel like I'm only wasting my therapist's time.

Obviously we haven't talked about much as we had only about 45 minutes, but I explained what I could. I had no idea what to talk about because the moment I got into his office I was like... why am I even here? Do I even really have problems? (Can someone relate? Please tell me you can)

So, the problem here is... I got so used to the things that happen to me regularly (panic attacks, extreme fear of nothing, depression) that I'm not even sure if they are problems anymore. Like.. I still function, right? Today he told me he feels like my biggest problem is my non existent self esteem - I do not know my value and I tend to care about everyone too much and I never care about myself. And when I asked if he thinks I need the therapy he says he does think so. But when he told me I was like... wow. That's the whole problem? I probably waste his time. I mean I know he's paid for that but... why should I have a place in this therapy when someone may need it much more? He's probably laughing at me right now because I'm another 21 yo teen who thinks her problems are the biggest in the world.

A part of me knows it's not true, therapists probably encounter people with small problems all the time. But the bigger part of me is like.. I never want to go there again. I'd rather suffer alone in my room than feel like this.

How to overcome this shitty feeling? I'm aware of the fact I need help but I also think I'm stupid af for bothering him with something so stupid because I don't need help. I don't know... I feel like I'd be great in Orwell's doublethink.",20Feb2019,1

It’s been a few years since I went to reddit for mental health advice! I went on Zoloft around two years ago and I seriously thought I was cured. 

Around 3 days ago, I went to get my prescription refilled and was told that I had no refills. I have been on 150mg of Zoloft for around 6 months now due to horrible intrusive thoughts and anxiety. Although it doesn’t completely make it better, it definitely helped.  And now that I’ve been 3 days without it... I can tell a huge difference. I feel... paranoid and keep having suicidal urges but I don’t really understand them because I know deep down that I love my life and my family. It’s super awkward for me and the anxiety I’m constantly feeling is horrible. 

Has anyone had any experience being off of Zoloft for a few days? What were your side effects?

81,"For some context, my 23 years of life have been a pretty continuous stream of what my therapist refers to as *chronic trauma.* I've had my *acute* moments of sexual assaults, burglaries, and fights, but most of my trauma is dragged out over years, most notably abusive relationships.

I've had two. One with a classmate in middle school that still gives me nightmares to this day, and one with a boyfriend of three years that I am still recovering from.

My boyfriend was my best friend for two years, then something changed, seemingly overnight. He's had his mental health problems, but this was a whole new monster. I honestly don't particularly want to go into details, but after almost a year of this behavior I ended up in a mental ward for a week.

We've been separated for almost 4 months, but I still find myself so emotionally dependent on him, and I know it's bad, but ever since middle school I've had it drilled into my head that my self worth is entirely dependent on my partner's view of me.

I thought we could try to remain friends, that removing the romantic aspect of our relationship would remove me as a target. It's helped, but I still get yelled at and I still get sent into panic attacks where I risk hurting myself. I love him so much, but I hate myself for constantly turning back to him and repeadedly letting myself get hurt.

He's not going to therapy any time soon, he's not getting a reliable job any time soon, and he's not going to care about me again. I'm starting to really appreciate that.

But it's so fucking scary.

I've decided I need to cut him out of my life, but to have someone who's been a constant for three years, who was my best friend and support system for so long vanish is terrifying. I'm in a time of transition in my life and I don't have anyone else I want to talk to about this stuff. I don't feel close enough, vulnerable enough to let them in like that. Even now, *he's* the one I want to tell this to, and it's about cutting *him* out.

tl;dr: I'm coming out of my second abusive relationship and I'm just really fucking sad. I know he became bad for me, but that emotional dependence developed from the first one is a bitch to beat. Now that I'm finally cutting him out from my life, I feel like I've lost a chunk of me and I feel so alone without him.",20Feb2019,2
82,"I've [16M]been struggling with depression for long now and I'm so exhausted. I really tried my best but I'm not strong enough to live in this world. I have been struggling to stay alive but I can't do this much longer. I've never had many friends but I didn't mind that because i had 3 really close friends. One of them was the first to know about my mental health. She meant the world to me and I fought hard to live because I was willing to go through it if I could still be friends with her. I was going to 'end the pain' around July last year, I had it thought out and everything but I didn't do it because her birthday was coming up and I didn't want to taint that. Not ending myself is perhaps my biggest regret. Sometime after that she got mad at me for the strangest thing ( we had our main exams and I forgot to her a few songs, which isn't strange because I am a bit forgetful). She stopped talking to me and it stayed that way from August 2nd or so to December 14th. I was really heart broken over this. The person I cared more for than anything cut me off as if it was nothing. I cried almost every day. I tried to patch things up around December 14th because we are in 11th and the students of class 11 throw a farewell for the students of class 12. So I talked to her and it went well, I was so happy to be a part of her life again. I told her how much farewell meant to me and asked I'd we could hangout( btw this isnt like a prom kind of situation. It's just a friends kind of thing) she said yes and I was glad because that meant I didnt have to worry on that day.  Its something I've looked forward to for around 10years. I always dreamed of just being with my friends on that day. I didnt expect anything massive , i just wanted to be by their side. The day came and she seemed like she didnt want me around. I was really hurt but I tried to stay calm. I tried and was just getting a negative response. Finally I asked her why she was being like this and she said that she doesn't want to talk to me. We used to be so close. We shared things with each other that we didnt share with other people. But now she was just staying with people that she was never friends with and put me aside. I just felt my heart rip to shreds. It was just the most painful thing in the world. The person I was willing to live for wanted me out of her life and with no reason. It was like it didnt matter to her at all. As if that wasn't bad enough my only other friends cut me out. 1 ignored me for almost 50 days straight and just left me on read. And the other friend also stopped talking to me. I feel so lonely. I have been getting professional help for a while now. I go to a psychiatric hospital and the doctors are amazing. I have had my meds adjusted many times now and nothing works for more than a month. I have tried all the things I was supposed to. I really tried my best. But now I'm tired and I just want the pain to end. I want to fade away knowing it's my last moment because maybe I deserve it. If the people closest to my heart are tired of me then maybe I dont deserve to live comfortably.

84,"Where to begin...

I moved from the west coast last year. It wasn’t ideal, and I didn’t have any ideal living situations out there, but I felt like I was home. I began dating someone long distance and felt such a strong connection, it was worth moving. the west coast became hollow for me because she wasn’t there so I decided “why not”? Well...

At first, everything was great. Her kids love me and i got two jobs right away. Two. I struggled getting a single job in the WC after 6 months, which is partly why I stayed at most of my jobs for years at a time. The jobs were seasonal and I didn’t know what that meant but I was getting paid more than I ever was. It felt good to have money for once that I didn’t need to spend. I still missed home but what’s home without my new family? It was tolerable.

Then winter...

Initially, it hurt because I had a miscarriage and my seasonal jobs were coming to an end. So I had to find another job which felt like I was striking gold... until I realized the mess I was walking into. It wasn’t a place set up for success. They had some former employees ruin their former reputation and had a whole new staff to pick up the pieces. It wasn’t great, and I wasn’t getting as many hours. But then a light. Shortly after my girlfriend’s miscarriage, we had another baby on the way. And so far so good. I wasn’t getting much hours but I decided I’d sign up for a delivery service and look for another job.

Though, as fast as all of it came... loss was around the corner

I was picking up the kids one day and the parking lot was ungodly packed. I had to weave a damn suburban through the thinnest lanes I’ve ever done and for a big tank of a vehicle, I was going a good job... until my last turn. I get ready to turn and back into a spot and I overshoot my turn and clip someone’s bumper. “Damn it”
I tried calming this raging mom, but she wanted the cops on the scene. Apparently because she had a lease, she needed a police report. I called my girlfriend immediately because this isn’t even my vehicle. Found registration and insurance and talked to the cop. Cop didn’t really like me one bit. Trying to convince said cop of my trials in a now empty parking lot with my west coast ID in a vehicle that wasn’t mine felt fruitless. Low and behold, a ticket racking over $500. Lovely. Even more to deal with. Girlfriend said we’ll handle it. I’m racked with guilt, but we press on. 

Then that Saturday...

The shifts at my job had been difficult while this was happening. High standards and expectations for what little we’re able to produce. Rushed products and a 2 man job being done by one. I just felt like I was gonna fail. Luckily I got a new job, and then the delivery service set me up to get started. But I go in, run this shift. I’m alone for most of it but I do my damn best and even though it’s tough, I feel like I do a damn good job. Nope. SIKE. The owner apparently wasn’t pleased, chewed out my manager after I left and I got fired over text.

The guilt at this rate is higher. I’m not doing enough and I’m just not getting anywhere. So I decide to try out this delivery service the next day. It’s going alright. I make about $87 that day... but it begins to snow. And holy hell do I not know snow. I was on my last order and started making a turn and the vehicle began sliding... 

Fuck me... I’m gonna crash.

Sure enough, I slam into a guy’s door and dent it. We trade numbers and I go finish my order. I can’t even bring myself to tell my girlfriend this happened and since the bumper was easy to pop back on, I hid it. But then he contacts me the next day. The bill for the damage is $1200. I’m absolutely not ready. I beg for a payment plan and he’s sympathetic and says he’ll sleep on it. I’ve been paranoid on the road but ohhhh today... 

Today I backed into my girlfriend’s mother in law’s vehicle.

I feel like I just wanna let go of life itself if you catch my drift. I’m aggressively depressed and when I thought I was cured of depression a while ago (as I have had a long history of it), the idea that it never goes away has never been stronger.

I know I need help but as you can see, with my lovely amounts of debt... it’s not as easily available. I don’t know what to do.

I’m waiting to fight the ticket in court, and hoping the guy is merciful. And I’ve lost all confidence that I can be good at my new job and it shows.",20Feb2019,1

86,"backstory I guess: I'm 19, almost 20. I was diagnosed a little over a year ago with depression when I disclosed to a friend I was think of suicide. She forced me to go to one of the counselors/therapists at my school, where I was then sent to the hospital. So yeah... onto the actual reason for the post...

&amp;#x200B;

When I'm alone, or on the bus (mainly because who cares on public transit), I drop my act of this happy girl who is always smiling and laughing and all around joyful. Problem is, I can't drop the act with my therapist. She literally told me I brighten her days with how spirited I am. I just don't know how to drop the same act I've been doing since I was 12/13 when I feel like my depression started to show signs.

88,"Since January 4th I’ve been taking 50gms of sertraline a day to help with my anxiety and depression. My mental health has overall improved and I’m very happy about this, but there are some aspects of my personality, such as double checking and doing everything in a sequence, that really helped me at work. 

I forgot to shut my oven off and my boyfriend discovered it 8 hours later. 
Yesterday I left my left my vehicle running in a parking lot, with the keys in it. I was 20 feet away before I realized I didn’t have my keys in my pocket. This is highly unusual for me and risky. 
I’m a truck driver and I didn’t notice last week, in my 3 walk arounds, that one of my airlines wasn’t hooked up. 
I’m simply not noticing important(and potentially dangerous) things that I would effortlessly see before.

 For the past 6 months my mental health has plummeted to constant suicidal ideation and self harm. I can tell he is getting frustrated that he can't just fix me with well meant advice. It's obvious I can no longer discuss my mental health at all with him without hurting him and making him nervous around me. At the same time, I cant lay in bed next to him holding all of this hurt and knowing I will be judged for letting this darkness slip.

I am on four meds, have a psychiatrist, therapist, and will soon be going into an intensive outpatient program - everything I can possibly do to feel well. 

As you know, this is a chronic disorder. I can never promise I will stay well. 

Is it fair to him to continue our plans with marriage, knowing there is a possibility this could get even worse?

It kills me everyday knowing that any time she's sees me, instead of love and joy, she is driven to tears and pain. While i am not a perfect person, I was always there for her when she had troubles with anxiety and panic attacks. I was firm and deliberate, pushing back against her demons and making her feel not like a victim, but rather a soldier. I wanted her to fight, and she is so strong and brave to have come this far. But from the outside, I can see how some people would construe my efforts as controlling. And while I did control her, it was in ways like getting her out of bed before 1pm, removing sharp objects from her vicinity.

Being with her made me the happiest I'd ever been, but now? While I did have some minor mental issues related to stress (I'm in college), none of that compares to my newfound daily battle against guilt and self hatred. I was her everything, and she mine. She thought she was too dependent. That was her reasoning behind leaving me. But in realty, i too depended on her.

1) I do not like my job. It's a great job that makes a good living for my little family and has amazing health insurance but the job itself is tedious, exhausting, and unchallenged all at once. 
2) my house is in a constant state of chaos. Whether it is dishes piled in the sink or the laundry basket over flowing for the third time this week because the cat got sick again it feels like a constant disorganized mess. 
I'm stating these two points because I spend 50% of life at work and 50% of life at home and finally something has to give because now this unhappiness has flooded into my marriage and relationships with other family. As of right now I cannot quit my job. It would be too stressful financially and I'm currently studying at the local community college so the loss of this income would be severe. Instead I'm focusing on reinventing our house to make it an organized home by getting rid of anything that hasn't been used in four months.

97,"I feel guilty about how I am feeling, because I know people go through so much worse. But as someone who has struggled with mental health, my emotions are not always proportionate to the situation.

6 months ago my gf and I of 2.5 years decided to take some time apart. We loved each other, but it wasn't working at the time. She took the dog and moved back to her mom's. The next 5 months or so were incredibly hard for me. I held onto our apartment as long as I could in case she wanted to come home. Finally I couldn't afford it anymore and the first weekend of February, I moved. It was incredibly difficult for me to give up our home.

I thought this was going to be as bad as it got, but then 2 days later, out of the blue, I lost my job. I lost my job because I had a coworker who took issue with me because I didn't always share her opinion about things, so she went behind my back, said I said things that I didn't say, made me out to look like a certain type of person, and it got me fired. The things she said I said, even though I didn't say them, aren't really that bad. But she's a 23 year old girl, and I'm a 33 year old man, and that's all that matters. I had no chance to explain my side. They did not interview the rest of my team. They just fired me. My lawyer says I probably have a discrimination case and I could likely win it, but being a white male, suing for discrimination will just look bad on me.

I won't be able to find another job in my field that makes as much as that one did. Which means I won't be able to afford my new apartment. And I don't know what to do. I keep having suicidal thoughts, and just want to give up.

I've already been to the doctor, but I haven't brought it up. It felt like too abstract of a problem for me. My mom was also in the room, and I didn't want to unnecessarily worry her.

Hello!

Next week I'll be visiting a doctor for a minor skin problem, but I wanted to ask whether I should bring this up or whether it's just some irrational worry, or see if anyone might know what the problem is.

Since early 2018 or so I've noticed myself stumbling over words with increased frequency. Initially it happened about once a day, now it's almost hourly, in fact I'm somewhat having problems while typing this post. I just completely cannot recall certain words for a while, sometimes it takes around 5 minutes of intensely trying to remember what word it was before it comes back to me. I'm often even not certain anymore how to spell certain words. This concerns simple words, like ""laboratory"", ""reference"", or ""precipitation"". I end up being able to describe what word I mean (eg for laboratory), and sometimes it comes back to me in pieces but I keep blurting it out like ""la....borto...rary...labratry....labatorary."" which, when occurring in the midst of a conversation is very awkward and uncomfortable.

When I'm typing or writing, I pause for long times in the middle of longer words, because I can't recall how to spell it out further, and when I push myself to keep writing, it's spelled terribly wrong, but I can't correct it until I can remember how to spell it correctly.

It happens with names too, names of people I've known for years. I was asked the name of a friend, it took me over ten minutes to remember her name, even though I spoke to her one day ago. When I was joking with a friend, I called out her name, only to realise I forgot how to. It came out like ""Ju...Juuulii.....ana. Juliana"" (not her real name). It sounds funny while typing it, but at that moment it was really awkward.

The main reasons this worries me is because I used to excel in language and things related to that, and now I make ridiculous spelling mistakes and my speech ends up being jumbled when I can't remember a specific word. There is also a history of neurodegeneration in my family, but to think it could be anything like that just sounds unlikely to me, because I'm only 21. I thought it might be caused by my ADD, but as far as I know, that shouldn't become progressively worse, and even on medication this particular issue has not improved.

If anyone is willing to offer me any advice or insight as to what could cause this problem, I would greatly appreciate it.",20Feb2019,1

I really fucking hate myself for this. I feel like I'm retarded and worthless because I'm not graduating at 18 like everyone else. I feel like everyone will judge me and look down on me for the rest of my life and i won't be able to get a job or get into college because they'll think there's something wrong with me. What makes it worse is that my sister whose 6 years younger than me is starting high school next year. Ik that i shouldn't feel this way because it's not my fault I  got sick and missed out on so many credits but i blame myself for it to the point I have suicidal thoughts pretty much every day because of it and i don't want to feel this way anymore.

106,"For the last two weeks, I have had the same dream right before I wake up. It always starts with me ""waking up"" next to my girlfriend in a smaller sized bed. We're pretty close, but there is a bit of space between us. I look towards the space and see a baby lying peacefully. The resemblance is uncanny. Its my baby. Our baby. 

When we met, I told my gf I never wanted children, but being with her changed all of that. My dream life was now to raise a family with her and spend the rest of my days being with and caring for them.

After a few minutes of lying there, I begin to fall back asleep, when all of a sudden, silence. No baby, no gf. They vanish into thin air and i am left alone in the same bed that brought me comfort, only to be stricken by panic and anxiety. 

I usually wake up in a cold sweat, but last night my body tesnsed up so much that I had a charlie horse in both of my legs.

My gf recently left me, and she's the only thing ever on my mind. All I have left are the dreams we once held with each other and the hope that perhaps one day, things can work out between us...

107,"To begin, I am schizoaffective (or so they say). I have been forcefully put into a ward 5 separate times, each for a month each. I have not been hospitalized since 2015. Despite being prescribed medication for life, I have abstained from taking them and have yet to experience a lack of contact with ""reality"". Any psychiatrist throughout history would advise that I take my meds, which make me a zombie. Plainly a zombie. So here is my thesis:  


 Skepticism in regards to modern medicine and specifically psychiatry could be further expanded upon that beyond the pathologizing of suicide and erratic behavior in children, or depression of being a good person in a bad world and chalking all these things up to entirely genetic chemical imbalances, the powers that be other pathologize what might be, and very likely is - a spiritual undertaking of the inner soul to be not only stigmatized, but repressed to the point of the individual being treated being put out of society forever due to the repressive nature of the basal medical treatment. And that's pretty wack actually.  
\-  
To completely ignore the causation based in systemic societal issues and putting the onus then on a case by case, genetic and entirely physical science sort of treatment, the people are not only at the whim of what the psychiatrists want for them, they are at the whim of the stigma that goes with the illness they are diagnosed with.  
So modern psychiatry rather than ever curing anything in any sense, instead places a bandage on the wound and refuses to ever take it off, thereby letting the wound be hidden from the public eye, and impossible to fix.",20Feb2019,0

i just want to feel better so i can get help from some kind of talking therapy. i’m thinking anti depressants would suit me to kinda calm me down so i can get the help i need? 

i’ve just come to this thread because i’m worried what to say to the doctor (i’m from the U.K.). i have an appointment on Friday. i don’t know what to say or where to start. whether i tell him why i think i’m depressed or just the symptoms and how i feel? this would be the first time opening up to a stranger and i’m worried i’m going to make it sound ‘better’ than it is, as in that i’m fine. because this is what i’ve been used to doing. and if i do that i won’t be given help. 

will they ask me questions? 
what will they ask? 
is there a certain pattern or procedure they follow? 
what are your experiences? 

so i guess i’m just wondering what i should say. and whether i actually put forward that i think anti depressants will help me, or if i wait for the doctor to bring that up and then give my thoughts.

I've been to therapy/mental health facilities before, but never really stuck with the meds or therapy sessions due to either lack of funds or the stupid thought of not really needing any of that crap. But Its pretty apparent that I do now after almost dropping out of my D&amp;D group, and having to stop myself from walking over to my boss to tell him I quit the other day. It's good that I stopped myself, sure, but my bs could've gotten me kicked out of d&amp;d (this isnt the first time I've flipped out over almost nothing).
 
I was wondering about the level of care I'm going to need to get better. I have depression, some anger management issues, and anxiety (or as they called it, social phobia). I think about committing suicide fairly often, at least 3 days out of if not every day of the week to be precise. Basically, I was wondering about the level of care I'm going to need. Will I need to go into inpatient care, or will it be safe for me to start on outpatient based on my current symptoms? How much will all of it cost?

Any feedback at all will be appreciated, as I just want to make sure I'm prepared for this when I end up starting this arduous process, and dont end up quitting due to lack of funds/flipping out over any unexpected developments. I hope that this helps someone other than myself (as well as myself I guess) as living with this is hell and I wouldn't wish anyone extend feeling like this if they can help it.

111,".... But I appreciate it when it comes down to it.

My boyfriend has been out of work since right before Christmas due to physical pain and mental health meds issues. So we're hurting financially but we've managed to keep most of the immediate bills (rent, power, etc.) under control by dipping into our savings. Our savings is now running dry. We're being taken to court over medical bills. We're about to get ahold of an attorney about filing for bankruptcy. It's a whole complicated thing.

One of my coworkers had to file for bankruptcy a bit back so I contacted her on FB to ask for her attorney's contact info and she gave it to me this morning and was telling me some info. Right before this I was talking to a different coworker about how today is my now 6 yo niece's birthday and her party is Saturday and all she wants is those LOL surprise dolls. He overheard me talking to my other coworker and he came up to me about an hour later and shoved a bag into my work apron.

HE BOUGHT ME AN LOL SURPRISE DOLL FOR HER!!!

I didn't even know how to react to it and he was just like ""I heard you guys were hiring for money and wanted to help you out a little bit, don't worry about it."" And just left.

I started crying and had to step off the sales floor for a good 10 minutes....

My coworkers have always been amazingly helpful and supportive of me when I'm having problems. Earlier this week I started having really bad anxiety and panic attacks while at work. I was trying to calm myself and it wasn't working. I had a thought that I could grab the scissors and cut my arm to ground myself, realized that was a bad thought, and went to my manager. He let me leave and said to be ok and safe and stuff. He even offered to drive me home but I declined and said I'd call my boyfriend.

It's just hard for me to accept this, that people actually care, that people will help me even without me asking, that people are going to be ok with me with my issues and just take it as I'm me and this is just a part of things.",20Feb2019,1

I think about dying a lot. What happens when I die? do I want to die? do I want to live? what would be the best way to die? I go down the list of ways to die that may be honorable or pleasant, or quick, and I always come back to one decision: I'll kill myself. 

Every day I make a decision not to do it - yet.

I think about leaving my family a lot. They'd be fine without me. They'd be better off without me. Maybe I could get away with cheating on my wife. Maybe I would get caught. Maybe she'll cheat on me; then, I can finally get away. Maybe the only way to get away is to kill myself. 

Every day I make the decision not to go through with it - so far. 

I'm not scared. Even with my anxiety disorder, I'm actually pretty calm about this notion of suicide. I think it would be easy.

I'm doing well, I got a promotion at my job I don't want. I have a nice car I don't want to pay for. I have a pretty good life I don't want. 

I constantly argue with myself about how I should keep going- just keep living. I justify my positive feelings with empathy, but I also justify my bad feelings with selfishness.

This is becoming a daily struggle. I'm telling myself that I could just end it all, but then what. I could sleep with my coworker, but what would that accomplish. I could drive my car off the bridge, but who would clean up the mess I leave behind. I know the answers to all of those questions, but I also know how easy it would be. 

It's almost as if I've got this internal struggle of greed vs doing what's right. ",20Feb2019,1
116,"I’m 19 years old (male) and I have a elongated head shape, long and narrow, the condition itself I believe is called Scaphocephaly. 

I was born with this condition which is extremely rare due to positional moulding of my skull from birth, normally it is treated with surgery from a young age (less than 2 years old) and into adulthood from what I believe it is pretty much untreatable, after becoming obsessed with my head shape it has psychologically scarred me to the point at which I can’t even leave my house without wearing a hoodie without dying from anxiety.

Pretty much my whole life as long as I can remember I was bullied for it, less so as I got older but it still happens nevertheless, I want to progress onto uni and the rest of my life but I am too afraid of what people will think of me/judge me etc, at the moment I am living at home with no purpose/direction in life depressed that my future will hold very little, I really don’t want to be a loser in life with nothing to show for because that’s really how things are panning out right now, I’m also too afraid to get a job because of it.

I regularly cry to myself and think why me, I think I have fortunately pushed past my suicidal phase, I also have no real friends and have always been excluded from friend groups and parties. 

I want to have surgery more than anything in the world regardless of the risks but I don’t believe there is any treatment available for me.

I guess I’m writing this to seek someone’s opinion, or help of some form, maybe from somebody who’s experienced something similar.

117,"I am usually a positive person, but recently (past 6 months) I have turned very negative. Not so much on self imagine. But more on the content/value of life.

I was a stressed 6 year old, i was the only 10 year old with bags under his eyes. This is how I've always been this constant non relenting pressure on my brain,and nobody payed attention.

121,"&amp;#x200B;

* Extreme difficulty fitting in with other people. I spent a ton of time (\~11.5 years) in the hospital as a youngin'. I didn't have much exposure to other kids my age and thus spent more time with older folks. Thus I always got on with older people--always--much better than people my own age. This prevented me from making friends. Even as an adult (28) I struggle to make friends.
* Extreme resistance to being controlled. If I perceive a situation where I will not be able to control the outcome, I mentally seize up, go into flight or fight mode, and descend into madness. This can be something as dumb as an onlien game where I become a rage *beast* when I start to lose due to my perceived lack of skill. If I can't figure out a way to beat them I can resort to wanting to self-harm (i.e. having the urge to stab myself in the arm), destroy things, hurt people, etc. I normally just step away and breathe, but it doesn't change the fact that such things are not healthy--at all.
* I can take-or-leave relationships. Seriously. Moving away from my family for (potentially) forever? No problem. I don't really care. I just seem to lack the ability to properly bond with people. I mean, I get to the point where I enjoy having them around, but there is no fundamental ""roots"" for a bond. It's just like ""Oh, I love you"", but I could just as easily discard them and continue on like they never even existed.
* Extremely competitive. Very, very competitive. Like, I can become toxic. If I perceive somebody better than me, I will do everything in my power to ""one-up"" them.
* Periods of feeling highly empathetic and happy to periods of emptiness, loneliness, and feeling like I should kill myself within an hour, sometimes. Sometimes this will last weeks, others... not so much. It seems to have gotten much, much, much worse as life's responsibilities piled on.
* I feel like extremely good things will never happen to me, even though I feel like, at times, I have the potential. I have an above average IQ and know I can achieve certain things, but it's like my experience in life (i.e. getting better from being ill to only end up in the hospital again after like a week) that made me think that my life is just going to be bad event after bad event, and that there will always be more bad than good.
* I feel like I can't take care of myself. My parents, while they support me, don't really support me in a very stable way. I can't really explain it, but it's like... they don't reinforce their confidence in me. They seem to think that while I am a smart guy, I will just end up living with them four hours away from the city once they move away. I don't have any confidence in myself to hold a job down, but I want to. I forced myself to go back to school and did quite well (high 80s in my programming courses), but am extremely afraid of going off on my own. I still live with my brother, at 28. I want to live on my own, but I just... am apathetic. I can't even find motivation to go out and buy food, so I just eat whatever's here.
* Can't stay interested in one thing for too long. I get obsessed with something, develop a reasonable level of skill in it, then get bored, lack motivation, and stop doing it. This happened with my job. I got bored, demotivated, fired for poor performance. There was just nothing I could find to keep my mind interested in the job, and found myself searching on Reddit, etc.
* Have an on-and-off empathy switch. I can go from crying tears of joy for somebody at their wedding to walking by an old woman who cracked their head on the sidewalk (which actually happened--I only offered help when I saw other people doing so; besides that, didn't care. I just focused my attention on school.)
* Can't learn things that don't interest me. Simple card games can be an arduous task for me if I lack the motivation to learn them. This was shown when my friend tried to teach me SkipBo. I severely struggled to learn the rules and just went through the motions based on what other people did. Talk physics, philosophy, computer programming, etc? I will likely understand it with relative ease.
* Don't have much of a ""filter"". People ask me what they think, I will generally tell them, full-stop. At work this was a problem because apparently how I said things was not very nice (i.e. ""Your code has errors here"" instead of ""There are some issues here, here, and here""), and apparently they thought I had issues with accepting responsibility for my actions.

125,"First of all, English is not my 1st langugage and not sure, if this belongs here  
anyway,

  
To my past, i got bullied from 1st to 5th class, 1st-4th was my first years in primary school but it turned out pretty bad, many (even poeple who where cleary older and/or higher classes) bullied me. i asked for help in school, but nothing was done to stop it, i asked my parants but they misjudged the situation (dont worry i still have a pretty good relation with them).So i had go threw ""hell"" and nothing was done,so i had to take it.

In the 5th class i went to a comprehensive school, that went down hill very quickly, the same people from my old school where there and didnt hesitate to go hard on me. Lucky a teacher noticed it and helped me out, and i didnt saw them and/or got bullied again.

After this experience, i isolated myself, i didnt involved in school that much, i avoided conversations with anyone except i had to and i was often just by myself, but lucky i had 2 friends who stand by my side so i wasnt always alone.

i also had times where my motivation went to 0 and below, like i didnt feel joy that much and had some thought  processes like ""They dont care about me, they wont notice when im not at school,etc"" i still went to school and the only times i didnt went is becouse i was i'll. Also i had some suicide thought but went off pretty quick.(so no worries at that point)

Right now many thinks didnt realy change, im still insulating myself, i avoid contact with my classmates, didnt find any new friends and often just by myself. which im used to for years.

i also often feel uncomfortable speaking to strangers or people i dont know, especially when i have to talk about myself or anythink related to me.

Now im here, used to be alone most of the time, sitting at my PC playing games mostly alone (to kill time,enjoying the game) or watch some Videos at Youtube. With no (new) Friends, mostly by myself, just taking the stuff and not realy doin anythink against it.

126,"A little background, I have lupus and depression. I work from home as a marketing manager for a firm. I used to love my job but with more responsibilities comes stress. 

For the past 6 months, I’ve been a depressed mess. I’m guessing the stress of my job has caused one flare up of my lupus. I also had a baby over the summer and only took 1 month off because that’s all they gave me paid. 

I have taken 2 weeks off back in October. And just took 2 weeks off in February. Those 4 weeks have been the best I’ve had in a long time. I was essentially a stay at home mom - I have 6 kids in all (blended family) 4 in school. 

I spent time writing jokes (my passion is comedy) and working on a comedy TV show pilot. I cared for my two younger children during the day. I was able to cook for my family, something I had previously been too stressed to do just about every day. 

I’ve asked my boss if I can have a smaller work load and he’s said yes several times but it never happens. 

The issue is that I am really good at my job. I used to love it but I don’t anymore. And the pay is very good. Like extremely good. But when I work, I am miserable.

127,"I’ve recently met someone who was... incredibly open. She had several issues she openly confessed to and a jaded past full of skeletons.. but she didn’t hide. It still confuses the hell out of me...


It’s caused me to reevaluate my life in a startling way. So many things that I’ve blocked out because I don’t want to face them. These... monstrous acts.

I’ve had trust issues my entire life, to the point where not a single person in my life knows who I am. I’ve faked almost every interaction I’ve ever had with people. So much so that I thought that was normal, people just pretending to be what is expected and never showing any true emotion. “Everything is ok”, “ I’m fine” that’s the only answer I’ll ever give when asked how I am. What am I suppose to say? “Oh you know, feeling like a big piece of shit today” that’s not an acceptable thing to say.. I could never have the balls to be so brash with my emotions like that. Not even my mother or “brother” have ever heard anything like what I’m writing. That’s waaay more intimate than I’m comfortable with, it’s easier here where  no one knows who I am. I don’t have to deal with you on a daily basis. I won’t have your looks of pity or disgust greeting me every day. It’s just as easy to remove this mask and wear another that can blend in.

But back to the matter at hand, I’ve never been able to get over my trust issues. Sure, I’ve got friends and colleagues that I talk to and occasionally will hang out with. None of them know who I am or even something as simple as the fact that I love anime. It’s not such a weird thing these days, I’m not ashamed of it. But I don’t want to let people close enough to know me. If they let me down and we’re just friends like we are now it’s not big deal. I always plan for them to let me down so it’s fine. It’s less painful that way. 

Where it becomes unstable is in my love life.
I will constantly make up scenarios in my head of everything and anything. Every scenario imaginable, not just the cliché “they’re cheating on me”. Or worse yet I’ll let a relationship start or drag on without any emotional connection whatsoever. Just leading those poor people along for months or even years. Just because I’m afraid to say no, and the crippling thought of never being able to trust someone and dying alone. I keep saying to myself “it’ll be different this time” but it never is. I won’t list them all here, but I’ve absolutely toyed with peoples emotional well-being more times than I’m proud of. I may have even been a contributing factor to a suicide, I hope not.. but I can’t be certain.

I had been talking to someone online for several months, we were just friends looking for someone to listen and talk to. She had told me all about their alcoholic mother who would verbally abuse them on a daily basis. A significant other that just wanted to have sex all the time and an absent father who she had never met. I was a great listener, and I would think of fun and different ways for her to improve her life view and her outlook, so that things wouldn’t feel as heavy. For the most part it worked, she was always bubbly and excited when ever we would talk, and I didn’t know how to feel about it. I didn’t want to seem callous so I employed a technique I often use “mirroring”. I would mirror a portion of her energy and we got along great for the most part. I never really shared much about myself but they didn’t mind or pry. One evening she had mentioned that she wanted to break up with their significant other. I of course encouraged it. They weren’t good together, they always argued and never saw eye to eye on a lot of issues. So I thought it was a good move. Well.. I never hinted at it or suggested it but she took that as a “break up with him and date me” .. that was not I meant. To start, we lived thousands of miles apart... I already knew it was a bad idea. But when she approached me after she had broken everything off she followed it up with “now I can be with you”. I didn’t know how to respond to that, I also felt sorry for her.. that if her life was that bleak.. that she would break up with a person to essentially date her phone.. So I played along, I thought “maybe something will be different, j mean we get along so well”. A few months pass by and she starts throwing around the “L” word and making talk of flying out to visit me for an extended stay, or flying me out to her for a while. It was at this point I had to say something. I couldn’t let her waste her money on me... I was a liar, a con artist, a monster. 
She was a “cutter” with suicidal tendencies before we started talking. After I had come clean about everything and how I never meant for this to get to this point the damage had been done. I’ve never heard from her again. I’ve tried to reach out in the past and have never gotten a reply. I really hope she’s ok. But the worst part of it all is I haven’t given her a thought in years. I’ve pushed it out of my head to the point I don’t even remember her name. 

She’s not the only one I’ve lead on like that, or purposely played mind games of trust that were impossible to win. I can’t stop doing it, the worst part is I know I’m doing it after the fact and I could recognize all the signs and every landmine I’ve ever planted in my relationships. But I can’t stop it or see it when I’m in the moment. 

The person I mentioned at the top of the page, I’ve told them every sin I have and wrote it down so that I could see it. And I think she’s afraid of me now. She says my writing is full of anger and emotion. So much so that it makes her uncomfortable to even read it. I don’t plan to ruin her life in any way, just in case you think I’m starting the cycle again. More so she has similar stories, but not quite as monstrous as mine I guess. She asked me “how do you even breath with all that inside you”. I’m still not sure what she meant, inside me I feel nothing. It’s easier to push my problems away than to face them. Most of my deeds I had written down barely  evoked any reaction to me, while others I admit were still raw. Corpses of the deeds not yet fully buried.

I’m hoping I don’t scare her away, even monsters need friends right?",20Feb2019,1

133,"Background: For all intents and purposes, I can say my life is not going particularly horribly. I've had worse. I've certainly felt worse. My worst mental health state was during undergrad but my tuition covered going to the university counseling center. Since I go to a small commuter school, not many people use the counseling services but they have very attentive staff and the psychologist I was assigned was very great with helping me learn to be self-aware. Basically, she helped me out of a really tough spot without having to prescribe me any meds (she wanted to see if I could learn good coping mechanisms on my own first). I stopped seeing her after a while when things went better. As a side, I went on hormonal birth control and I feel like the hormones helped me mellow out a lot, too. Unfortunately, I could only be on them for 2 years (DEPO shot, for anyone wondering, it reduces bone density) so I chose to switch to non-hormonal bc. After the hormones flushed out, I feel like my mental health state is returning to how it used to be, even though I had made such huge strides in 'getting better'. I no longer have access to counseling services because I graduated and I don't have the financial means to seek out other mental health care.

The anticipation of hearing back from the schools, coupled with the rejections, has shot my anxiety through the roof but I've been trying to calm myself by reminding myself that I went into the application process knowing that those 3 rejections were from 'reach' schools and most people get rejected in their first round of applications anyway. But the more I try to calm my anxiety, the more nihilistic I become. It's getting to the point where I'm thinking ""Well, what's the point anyway? None of this is real. Nothing I do matters because none of 'this' matters."" 

I find it increasingly hard to make/maintain genuine relationships with people because ""why bother?"". I have trouble relating to people and I've stopped caring about other people's feelings like I used to and it all comes back to ""why fucking bother?"". If a relationship is not explicitly benefitting me, I see no point in maintaining it. But in the same breath, I feel heartache. I'm not sure how to describe it other than just a sad, aching feeling. I feel like I've regressed to childhood and I'm doing the whole ""I'll hurt you before you can hurt me, but now I have no friends"" thing all over again. Fuck.

134,"Long story short: I went to college for a semester in 2016, was so insecure I had a mental break down. Took a gap year, felt so confident I was a different person, went back to college this quarter (Winter 2019) feel so shitty and insecure again.

It’s clearly the college environment that does something to me. Being surrounded by my peers, comparing myself, feeling like everyone’s judging me, idk, but I completely lose it. What the fuck...I know the answer is “stop comparing yourself” but my brain just does it so naturally, I’ll glance at someone at compare my entire life to theirs. ",20Feb2019,1
135,"I've got issues with self-worth and lack of it. To clarify, I see self esteem and worth to be different. I am confident as a person, I am confident in how I look and I know I can tackle just about anything if I put my mind to it. My challange is, I have a very ""so what?"" attitude about everything I do. 

For example: I did running start, graduated with an AA at 18, got my Bachelor's at 20, 6 weeks after graduation got my current job which is a real career job. It's a starting job, a stepping stone into my career, but nonetheless it is a good job, pays okay, benefits and all. I also worked 20-30 hours a week while in college doing 15-20 credits a quarter. None of this has been THAT hard for me therefore I have a ""Well anyone could do this."" outlook and dont value a lot of what I do.

So, I know I can do a lot and succeed. But I place almost no value into my accomplishments. Does anyone have any tips on how I can work on that? Journaling prompts? Meditation techniques? I'm open to anything.",20Feb2019,2
136,"so basically i’m 17F, i’ve had issues with anxiety my whole life ( but haven’t gone to any doctor about it ) and recently i’ve noticed myself developing weird habits where i have to check things over and over even though logically i know it’s unnecessary. i talked to my friend about it last night and we were talking about how at the very least it sounds like there are some symptoms of OCD. i told my mom about the stuff i’ve been doing bc it’s just really been bothering me and draining me mentally, and immediately she started telling me how “she has done stuff like that too” and “it’s so common” and i’m not “washing my hands 50 times a day” so i’m probably normal. she mentioned that i could go talk to someone if it would make me feel better, but i just felt like what i thought were legitimate concerns were being dismissed :((",20Feb2019,1
137,"I know this probably sounds stupid. I had a session the other day, where I was going into an explanation of how I've noticed some of my behaviors from over the years and he said something along the lines of ""you're quite insightful, huh.""

And I don't know if it was the tone, or the blank expression with how he said that but it's been in my head since. Can someone suffer from mental health issues and still be insightful? I sure don't feel like it in the moment.

140,"So, a bit of backstory. My girlfriend's housemate has always struggled with depression and other mental health issues. However, at the end of last year she was sexually assaulted in her own room after a date. Since then she's been fluctuating between really bad and borderline coping. At the time we did everything we could for her, took her to a sexual assault clinic, cooked her meals, took care of her etc. She got to a point where she was getting to grips with life again. 

Unfortunately, recently she has started to spiral again. Over the past few weeks she has started having hallucinations of her attacker in her room and around the house. My girlfriend has been trying her best to calm her down when this happens and prove to her that it's not real. She has been to see a psychiatrist who changed her meds slightly, and is hopefully going to see a therapist soon. However, we're at a loss for what we can do in the meantime. Whatever we do it just seems to be getting worse and my girlfriend is really struggling. Of course, we know that it's not the house mate's fault, she isn't to blame for anything. We just want to help her as much as we can but are running out of options.its getting to a point where it's affecting my girlfriend's mental health,

Any advice would be appreciated",20Feb2019,2
141,"Hi my name is Phillip, I am 22 years old. I was raised Catholic and my dad is very dedicated to his faith. My family and I go to church every Sunday and I also pray daily. I believe in Demons and an exorcist wrote in his book that there are only demons and angels that roam the earth, also I believe him since he is a catholic exorcist priest so I'm not entirely sure if I believe that human spirits also roam as well. Anyways, I believe I have also experienced evil spirits (Demons) I cannot see them or touch them but I believe I've felt there presence in reality. For example, when I was mowing my backyard today I felt like something was there with me like something supernatural and like I was being watched or something. It does make you feel stressed and uncomfortable and I'm just wondering if it's a demon or it's just all in my head. Not to mention I am suffering from depression, social anxiety,paranoia in public, but I got the auditory hallucinations from Butane hash oil which is concentrated Marijuana. I smoked heavily from about 6 to 12 months and my hallucinations started after I took a large amount of wax(concentrated Marijuana)and which I was hearing loud demonic roars. I hear sounds not voices which I hear from video games, movies, and different sound effects that play in a loop. I also quite often hear demonic growls like a roaring demon. But I think I may have tinnitus because I hear constant ringing in my ears. Is this a demon? Or is it just tinnitus? Schizophrenia does run on my dad's side of the family so I'm not completely sure… I'm just confused about what's going on with me. I also experience constant dissociation. Sorry I know this is very long but I'm seeking freedom.
