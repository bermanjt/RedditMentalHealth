0,I am losing touch with reality and my brain feels like not functioning anymore. I am missing a purpose in life. I want to do so much but every day I feel like I am straying away from things which are close to my heart. There is this attachment to certain things which is giving rise to a fear of losing it all. I am trying but I am not able to keep up. I feel exhausted and brain dead sometimes. I don't want to go to a therapist for I am not prepared to learn what is wrong. How do you suppress such feelings?,07Apr2019,5
1,"I am on my second week of therapy and I am supposed to see a psychiatrist for diagnosis soon. I am very scared of going, and I feel like I will have to explain myself a lot and open up to things I am not comfortable about. I can't help but assume they will be cold and uncaring and just want to medicate me and invalidate me. I am also scared because the psychiatrist has a degree from India and I don't know if that means he will be really socially conservative/misogynist. It doesn't help that I am really afraid of men too... 

I guess I am just scared and want to know what to expect. If there is a better place to post this let me know.",07Apr2019,1
2,My daughter went inpatient on Thursday. She had cut herself previously and took a bunch of advil. We treated with outpatient. She recently cut herself again and made herself throw up.

Having lost a brother to suicide, and a friend in the hospital because of her attempt. I was starting to tear up. I said I had to go and my friend said she was sorry when walking me out.

5,I can not keep a job for longer than 6 months and its frustrating. I  wasn't worried about it until I left my last job for no reason. Now I'm worried I'll just keep repeating. I'm trying really hard to stay at my current job and I already feel anxious. I'm not sure why I keep quitting jobs. I've never really been a fan of work  or school environments.  I've learned now that I have to detach from my thoughts and a situation in order to keep a job but even that's getting difficult.  I'm not sure why I keep quitting. I feel like it's because I still live with my parents so I'm in this mindset. Is anyone currently going through this situation and  does anyone have any tips?,07Apr2019,2
6,"Okay a little background: 
My parents have been drinking for 20 years until my mom became religiously strict all of a sudden and quit. My dad still drinks. 

My family is Muslim, but they aren't that strict. Booze and drugs are too extreme, and so is going out with men ect..

 Last week I left my room completely wasted at 3 am and I wanted to go to my car but the door closed behind me and i didn't have my car keys aswell. Anyway, I don't know what happened but I stayed outside the house till 5 am when my dad saw me (God knows what state) and took me to the house and there was yelling and hitting (Mostly from my older sister, who is 31)

I woke up with bruises and a hideous head bang in my room. No phone, no door lock, no money, no laptop. My parents care about reputation a lot and I've destroyed that basically. 

I stopped eating for 4 days and my ed has worsened. Didn't leave my room. My dad hasn't spoken to me, and my sister completely cut her ties with me. (she was my bestfriend). My cousins gather up in the house every day but never checked up on me. The only time I can breathe is when my Mom drops me to my classes. (forbidden to drive).

The whole point is that I lost their trust. I haven't apologized to anyone because I feel like I don't deserve to be forgiven and I don't deserve to have anyone care for me or love me or take me back to their arms or whatever. The only comfort I have is my boyfriend whom I talk to on a regular basis on the phone  (They just returned it).


I don't know what to do, what to say, how to fix it. We're a big loving family and we spend a lot of time together and I feel like something's missing but I refuse to take actions. Out of all my siblings I think I put them through worst shit than they can handle.

I feel silly writing this. but an advice or kind words would help me immensely. ",07Apr2019,6

9,"Greeting everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I've never had a history of mental health and overall, I've been in great shape mostly all my life.  In December, I was down visiting my family for Christmas break and everything was going pretty well.  I was optimistic about the New Year and ready to get back home and get to work on some cool new projects at my job.  A few days before I left, I started noticing that I was having some Urological irritability (I won't go into the details).  I shrugged it off and figured it would pass.  On the day I was driving back, it started to get much more intense.  Like seriously intense.  Super painful.  I scheduled an appointment as early as I could with my primary and they ran some tests and gave me some medication, but the pain wasn't going away.  They referred me to a Urologist and they did some additional screenings.  Still...nothing definitive could be found.  I was having some very rough nights...no sleep...in constant pain...even started shivering because I was getting very scared that something serious was going on.  Eventually...it did start to pass about two weeks later.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I've noticed that it's very hard to do things now.  Simple things like video games...or just getting up to go to the kitchen...anything...my heart rate started to spike.  I've always been a calm person and had a great resting heart rate...not after this.  I even started to have episodes where I wake up and my heart rate is skyrocketing (160-170 bpm).  I was freaking out because last year I had my first EKG done and the Cardiologist identified me as having something called a WPW pattern (Wolff-Parkinson-White).  I won't go into the details, but it essentially means that I could be prone to having episodes of rapid heart rates.  When it was initially identified that I had that pattern, I didn't exhibit any symptoms of this syndrome, but I understood that it could ""activate"" at any time.  That's what freaked me out so much...I ended up in the hospital for multiple visits because I had convinced myself that I had activated this ""syndrome"".  Well, they ran a ton of tests, checked me out multiple times...and concluded that it was just ""anxiety"".

&amp;#x200B;

So, I decided to take a month off work and go down to recover with my family.  I honestly felt better and more secure being down there.  Had only one panic episode.  I was going to a therapist weekly and starting to get some control back over the activities that I was starting to avoid because of panic.  I thought I was getting into a good place mentally and I was feeling good about going back to work.

&amp;#x200B;

No less than a week back being up here...I'm in the same boat.  My heart rate goes up and down, I'm having those panic episodes, simple things are very difficult to do, I can't focus on anything without my heart rate fluttering.  I don't understand it.  Sleep is becoming difficult again.  I have this weird sense of pressure on my chest.  I went to my primary and told her the whole story, she got all the cardio records...and prescribed me Zoloft.  Her opinion is that I have a form of PTSD from the intense pain and fear that happened in early January that has led to panic episodes.

&amp;#x200B;

How in the world is it that I would have PTSD?  My understanding is that it has to be a very traumatic event.  Unless what happened just caught me off guard.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week I went into my dentist for a cleaning, right before the hygienist started I burst out crying. I had been holding my breath up until that moment, self coaching myself it was going to be okay, breathing slowly, and the moment came and I felt a panic attack arise. She was so kind, she sat me up and talked to me. I confessed that today was not a good mental health day for me, and I often cry (in the car) after my appointments but this time I couldn't handle it. I apologized profusely and felt so embarrassed. Thankfully she understood and let me reschedule my appointment. I went to my car and cried because I had failed myself. Since 2017 I have not missed a dental appointment.

&amp;#x200B;

You see, I go to the dentist a lot. All my life until this ripe age, I've had horrible dental experiences from, being awake during my wisdom teeth removal (2 extractions), 8 extractions in one day at the age of five, dentists doing poor work where my fillings fell out days after, etc. Add on my poor quality of dental hygiene due to depression, lack of insurance for a few years, and honestly just being plain scared out of my mind. Last year I got proper insurance that helped me get dental work done and I faced my fears (for the most part).

&amp;#x200B;

My teeth are still in pretty rough shape now. I have sever periodontists my dentist has told me multiple times. I have a pretty long dental plan ahead of me, that includes additional cleanings every 3 months, finishing off 2 root canals, 2 top wisdom teeth removals, 2 new fillings and 1 filling replacement. This is in addition to work they did last year. Positives, I have all my teeth, they look 'fine' just the horrific stuff that happens to your gums when you avoid the dentist for years from trauma and lack of insurance. I'm doing much better with brushing, flossing, and mouth was 2-3x a day (seriously I'm scared). I still feel really ashamed I let it become this way.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm writing this because... mental health really fucks with your body. We all know it fucks with our head but it fucks with the rest of our health as well. My teeth are fucked up. It's costing me so much money to get this all fixed. Luckily my insurance will cover some of it. Overall I'm giving you a rough estimate it's cost me \~3K + insurance payments. My dental office is also very kind to me and understands. But holy shit, this was not a side affect I would've realized I had to face.

&amp;#x200B;

Please take care of yourself, and please... hope for the best for my appointment on Monday.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Mental health fucks with your teeth too.

16,"This is really long and boring but it's pretty much everything that happened. I posted a few days ago about my friends wanting me to have an involuntary hospital stay and I agreed to go last night. They called 911 [6pm] and kinda prepared me for what was gonna happen, cops showed up first and some talked to my friends and two took me to another room to talk to me. Asked me my basic information, what was going on, if I had any weapons on me, asked to do a quick patdown that I agreed to, asked more questions about what my plan had been and what things I had access to that I could use to commit, where they were, and a bit about my friends. They told me they were going to call fire and ambulance and I was going to have to go to the hospital for an evaluation and to talk to a counselor and they would determine if I could come back home or have to go in for longer. They asked if I wanted to wait inside for the fire truck or in the back of their car and I asked if I could outside to smoke a cigarette and they agreed after a second and I hugged my friends bye and the cops went outside with me; smoked for like two minutes before the fire responders got there so I put out my cigarette and they started talking to me and taking my vitals, asked about any previous treatments I've had (I've had none) and medications (I take testosterone and am trans, the fire guy told me his oldest kid is too.) Pretty much just asked more of the same questions until the ambulance got there, I got in the back and the EMT told me that even though I was calm and seemed cool, policy was to secure at least two limbs of involuntary patients (which I again already knew), so he strapped my right leg and left arm to the stretcher, one EMT got information from fire and cops and let my friends know which hospital I was going to; the other EMT was with me, asking me more or less the same questions and was really nice and trying to lighten the mood (he was only a few months older than me.)  It was about a half hour ride maybe (idk their ambulances have mechanical clocks that break easy from all the vibrations) and when we got the the hospital [7pm] I had to wait strapped to the stretcher with my EMTs in the emergency entrance of the hospital for about an hour, where a cop/security went ver me with a metal detector wand thing, and finally a room in the psych ward opened (busy night with little or no counselors.) I text my friends when I found out what room I was going in and the EMTs told the nurse that I had been calm the whole time so I would probably okay unrestrained, she looked at me and asked ""If I don't restrain you are you going to hurt anyone or yourself"" I told her no, she said ""okay just know if you make any threats or attempts I will strap you down"" and I told her I didn't doubt it and I kinda shimmied from the stretcher to the hospital bed. They told me that they were gonna leave the room for me to change into a gown, all but underwear, put my belongings including clothes, shoes, phone, jewelry, ect. and that I was on camera so not to try anything. After that the same cop/security came in and metal detected me again, then a nurse came in, told me they were kinda short on counselors so I probably wouldn't be seen till morning but he could give me something to sleep and I said sure and he left[9pm]. A little after that a lady came in and got my billing/insurance info, emergency contact, if I wanted visitors, and some other stuff. New nurse came in and took a blood draw and got a urine sample and vitals. I think maybe a half hour after that the first nurse came back and gave me ativan (anti-anxiety meds) [10:15pm] and I asked if I could have anything to eat and she came back maybe 15 minutes later with a sandwich and fruit cup. After I was done eating time got a little hazy cause I started to get pretty sleepy (I'm guessing from the ativan) but I'm pretty sure they got my vitals again and got me a blanket before I fell asleep around 11pm. I woke up a few times throughout the night either from getting vitals take or the lady a few rooms down from me that would bang on her door and yell ""let me out!"" every few hours (didn't bug me that much. I knew I was in the psych ward and that the people there probably needed help. The nurses also said she had called 911 on herself so she was invol too.)  I woke up around 9am I think when someone came to get my vitals and I asked to go to the bathroom and they asked what I wanted for breakfast. A little after I got back to my room the counselor came in and did the evaluation (more of the same questions and some more background stuff) and set me up an appointment for I think a psychiatrist in a few days and I'll make follow up appointments from there. After that I ate and they said I was okay to go home, called my boyfriend but he was at work so they gave me my phone to get one of my other friends to come get me, went to the bathroom again, by the time I came back my friend was there, they gave me my paperwork and my personal belongings back and left me to get dressed, and I was allowed to leave [11:30am]. Overall it wasn't a terrible visit and it went a lot easier since everyone was telling me what was going to happen through the process, and it's a big step to getting better.",07Apr2019,2

19,"Hello friends.

For as long as I can remember (years) I have had what I would consider abstract suicidal thoughts ever night when I go to bed. I saw abstract because it is less of concrete thoughts and more like a craving or itch to die. Typically I will have a strong feeling in bed that it would feel really good if my jugular was cut, but I have also less frequently felt the desire to be shot in the head. Rationally, I don't want to kill myself. I'm not making plans to die. Yet every night I have suicidal ""feelings"". I deliberately make sure that there aren't any knives too close to my bed so that I can't easily act on those feelings. I would say I have a history of depression but hide it well. I am moderately successful in work, albeit my social life is a bit lacking. I got a cat awhile ago which has helped with general depression, but the thoughts remain.

They’re usually things of a similar nature to this like faces, figures walking, eyes opening and closing on random surfaces, and auditory are things like laughing, sails and moan, murmuring voices where certain words pop out like “stop”. Just talking about them is actually making them flare up so I’m going to move on.

Hi reddit, this is a bit of a long one, but it would really be helpful if you guys read all of it because I think all the information is relevant. I had some memories resurface so I’ll tell this story as I remembered it, not chronologically. But if you really want to skip ahead, **you can go to the bolded section.** 

I’m 18 years old, born and raised in America. I’m half Chinese and half white. Growing up, from about the ages of (maybe even before) 6 to probably 10, I’m almost certain I had anxiety. I remember being so scared of everything at all times, like a hypochondriac + I was afraid loved ones and I were going to die in a disaster or anything like that. It was so bad that I was nauseous with fear to the point that I basically stopped eating a few times and my weight would drop. Which was a bad cycle because I thought I was dying and that made me more scared. 

Then when I was 12, the anxiety stopped, but the depression kicked in. My grades dropped, and as my dad moved away and I lived with my traditional Chinese mother, she banned me from seeing my friends which made things worse. The divorce was ugly and my mom began to take it out on me through phases of physical and mental abuse (her telling me to kill myself and threatening to send me to live with my dad across the world) and “normalcy”. To be honest, she was always pretty strict, but she was generally a good mother before then.  Middle school through sophomore year (16 years old) of HS was pretty rough because of her, and my depression would come and go as it pleased, for weeks or months at a time. From those two factors, there was one point where i was 14  think I was close to attempting suicide because the sadness and hopeless were overpowered by a true panic of “I can’t do this anymore”. I sent a panic email to a family friend and it was so concerned i got pulled out of class, and she kind of mended the situation enough that I stopped feeling that way. 

If we cut to recently though, my life is actually pretty good now. I live at home but independent of my mom which is nice. I see my friends often and my grades are good too. I have a therapist (although she is kind of seeing me for free so I can’t see her that often which means less talking time) and we’ve worked through some of my issues about the abuse and depression. I still get suicidal thoughts sometimes, but I’ve thought about it for such a long time (on and off since I was 12) that I really understand the ramifications. I’m very confident I will never do anything because I’ve never reached that panic state since I was 14. 

During winter break, I was with my dad across the country, which just meant a lot of alone time because I don’t really understand how to have a normal parent/child relationship and I don’t have friends there. This wasn’t even the longest I’ve been away, but I started to experience a few concerning things. 

I was experiencing was very severe dissociation (at least what I think was severe) , or just milder dissociation at other points. I smoke a little weed sometimes and it was as if I smoked over my limits but there were 0 pleasant feelings. When my boyfriend was calling me, I could not comprehend what he was saying. I also experienced paranoia, I was very scared that someone was going to break in and kill me even though I factually knew that thought was not realistic. I was also very scared I was going to experience visual hallucination, I’d imagine I’d see figures in my room (that are hallucinations) and I’d be terrified of seeing them. I was also just generally scared of non-mortality related things too. 

Also, you know that ringing in your ear sometimes? I heard that but it was so loud. Like, it would overpower cars and people on the street when I’d be lying in bed. It was as if I had earbuds in playing that noise. And I wasn’t listening to anything super loud or anything that would damage my ears. 

So this is where the important part comes in. Just because my life became 100x better in the past year, I’ve blocked out a lot of everything that happened from the ages of 12-16, but I kind of knew about that. But when I was experiencing all of those things in on break, I remembered that I was going through the same thing when I was young too. Like at 6-10 years old, maybe earlier, in addition to everything I wrote up top, i was experiencing dissociation, that ringing, and paranoia.

I told my therapist about all this and she agreed that it wasn’t normal behavior for a 6 year old and that the fear seemed to stem from a place of feeling unsafe. I’ve heard from several family members that when I was a baby, I was taken away from my home by CPS, but of course they gave me back. I told my therapist about that and she said its something I could look into. ( I heard the tellings years apart from each other so I don't think they're lying, especially since they seem to understand the standard protocol of CPS) 

But I didn’t tell my therapist one thing because I don’t even want to say it. **This is the first time I have ever communicated this.** 

One of my family members on my mom’s side (since the divorce was ugly, credibility is not the best) told me that CPS took me away because someone tipped them that I was being sexually abused by family member on my father’s. I literally can’t even type it. I don’t feel unsafe or weird with that person, and I’ve never had anything weird happen within memory. Its been 100% normal. But when I was younger, my mom would warn me to fight back and not let them touch me if they tried. She said a lot of shit that I don’t really believe though. And another thing is, (I’m sorry, this is kind of inappropriate so you can skip to the next paragraph if you’d like), I started masturbating really early like maybe before 6. I didn't know what it was, but it felt good so i kept doing it. I heard that it’s sorta normal for young kids to do it since they don’t know but I also heard it could be a sign of abuse. 

As of now, I have a pretty healthy relationship with sex. I hooked up with a girl once last year and we did a little bit (i really just needed to figure out my sexuality), I’ve only had sex with one person, my current boyfriend. We’re still figuring things out since we’re new, but I think it's fun and I love the feeling of connection. I’ve never felt “dirty” or anything like that when we do things. 

So. I guess now I’m finished. Do you guys think something happened to me? Maybe not that, but something else? Do you think there's a way to find out? 

Extra information: It kind of seems like the mental health in my bloodline isn’t that good, anger issues on my mothers and maybe depression from my fathers. ",07Apr2019,5

https://old.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/babz3x/tifu_by_having_sex_haha_yeah_i_fucked_up_so_bad/

On /r/TIFU. I've always found that the most upvoted posts seem to be about sex so I wrote up a shitty post to make fun of them. It was shortly removed due to being less than 170 characters. So I made up a retarded short story as fast as I could to fill up that minimum limit. And now they are saying that ""no sane, sober person would come up with this"" so I must be a heavy drug user and have a mental illness. Well I am genuinely worried about what theyr'e saying so I was hoping I could have somebody analyze what's happening.

Or maybe the fact that my brain is taking this so seriously on it's own means that I need therapy? I don't know.",07Apr2019,0
28,"Hi, I'm not sure if this is the place to do this but I have kind of isolated myself and I don't know where else to go.  I just feel lost and broken and I feel out of control of my life.  I know logically I am in control but I don't think I care enough to do something about it.   And I don't like bothering the people in my life about how I am feeling anymore, and I think they are sick of it anyways. I feel very lonely but I know I did it to myself. I just don't know what to do.

29,"My mom and I’s relationship has always struggled for as long as I can remember. It really started to take a turn just before I started middle school. At first, I took it as your average hormonal teenager type thing and figured things would get better as the years went by. I’d like to note that as I grew up, my mother drank very heavily and I was emotionally/physically abused from the time I was in elementary school all the way until my junior year of high school. (This isn’t a pity me story, I simply want to provide background knowledge.) Now that I am older, about to turn 20 in June, our relationship has yet to progress. I find it hard to communicate with her, she tends to get on my nerves very easily, I don’t like to interact with her and I’m timid around her. Although I instinctively do these things, I would love to have a relationship with my mother but I struggle to do so with how quickly she can get on my nerves and how she makes me feel whenever I’m around her. I’ve attended counseling, and counselors could never truly help me find the answers I’ve been searching for. Online research hasn’t helped, so I’m wondering if anybody has any answers here? It may appear desperate, but nobody wants to hate their mom forever. Any advice? ",07Apr2019,1
30,"IDK.. I've come to some realizations and just looking for some interpretations of what they say about me. Sorry this may be a bit long.

I've noticed that I don't truly feel a lot of emotions, at least not the way I hear other people describe them. I almost feel like I'm kind of a robot in that regard. I have never felt empathy or sympathy for another human being. In fact, I hold human life in general in pretty low regard. I hear about a school/mass shooting on the news and folks around me are visibly disturbed and upset and all that's in my head is ""huh.. another one"" and then I go about my day. Even when family members pass I go to the funerals, fake the same emotions everyone else is showing.

Animals are different. I stopped once to let a mother suck and her ducklings cross a street, and the guy behind me purposely swerved and flattened one of the ducklings. I felt such rage and wanted to stop my car, walk over and smash his head in. Because like what a piece of shit.

I don't because I have a strong sense of self preservation and my desire to not be arrested is greater. But I find myself placing just about every single person I have to interact with or even just have a minor encounter with into a category of either stupid/unaware/uneducated, or asshole/entitled/piece of shit. Sometimes a lot of folks go into both. Honestly, if most of the people I encounter died in front of me I truly believe I wouldn't feel a thing about it except inconvenience.

I pick up on social queues, and put on a show when I'm around people at family gatherings or when I'm at work. I mean for the most part I find most people to be stupid, a waste of time and resources. This is especially so at work (level 3 IT support) but I've gotten commendations that im such a good people person and about how patient I am. But it's a lie. Inside I'm wishing most of these people would just get replaced with smarter ones.


Speaking of lies, holy shit is this where I shine. I can't act.. like in a play or something where people *know* I'm acting. But when I'm deliberately lying (which is a lot, I'll expand on that shortly), I can play it off to a T. I actually actively let my wife catch me in little lies that usually start  a very small argument/discussion, so that she develops a sense of my ""tells"" - so that when I lie about bigger things I can easily avoid those tells and she doesn't question me. I mean she truly believe she can read me like a book, except I'm the author.

I lie all the time. Often it's small lies to make whatever conversation I'm having end the soonest. But no matter what the lie is, or how many pile up, I am always able to keep them straight. I don't mix a thing up, it's almost like a rewire my memory so that every lie becomes the actual truth so if something else comes up that isn't fresh in my memory, I still flawlessly stick to the same story I told 10 years ago.

I don't feel love, either. I'm married, and I dont dislike my wife, we agree on a lot of big things, but there's something in me that.. idk if she died in a car crash one day on her way home my first thought would be how am I gonna pay some of the bills (we split many, and I can't cover them all). There have been some Rocky moments in our relationship and whenever I thought she was gonna leave I would show remorse (it was.usually my fault because I often act like I'm still single and make big decisions unilaterally), but that's fake too. I don't think I've felt true remorse for anything. But mostly that's because divorce would be a financial drain, a mental headache, and I'd ultimately have to talk to people, a lot.

I've wondered if I have the makings of a latent sociopath or something sometimes, but I've done some reading on the traits of them and don't think I really check all the boxes. 

I'm fully aware that I'm not getting a psychiatric diagnosis from Reddit. Just looking for what comes to mind as people read this.",07Apr2019,1
31,"Today, I've come to an understanding. 

I've had a revelation, of sorts. 

My mother is a toxic, emotionally abusive human being. This is something she's shown signs of in the past; with gas lighting me under the impression I was suicidal (side note: if I had been at the time, definitely wouldn't be typing this right now because of the things she'd said), she constantly guilt trips as well. Making it seem like I've done something wrong when I haven't. 

Tonight, she did both. It started as a small conversation about my past relationships; friends that I've grown apart from. She reminds me of my oldest friend, someone I'd known since I was around seven or eight. She guilt trips me about them, talking about how they had been ""there for me when I needed them,"" how ""I should never leave the people who have been there in my 'darkest hour,'"" and how ""It wouldn't hurt me to say 'hi' every once in a while."" 

Obviously, I'm upset by this. I'm angry. I have been in no mindset to uphold relationships with friends I've recently started talking to or have been talking to for a while, let alone ones that I haven't spoken with in years. I did get upset, I called her out for what she was doing and of course the tears come on. She's been drinking, I always have to remember that she's unstable when she's drunk. She has been for a long time. 

I step out, I go for a drive to pick up food and cigarettes (for her, might I add), but mostly to just clear my head at that point. I need to be away because I'm sick of the strain she puts me through. Speaking to her has become tedious. 

Once I get where I'm going, I get a text; ""I'm sorry. I'll never say a word again.""

She'd said something similar before I'd left. So the gaslighting begins. It's time for her to work her manipulative little words into my brain and make me feel sorry. 

I'm the one who has to regret what I said, even if it was in my own defense. I'm the one who suffers because she did something wrong. I'm the one who has to feel bad as she cries her crocodile tears after she's called out on the bullshit she put me through and has been putting me through for the past seven years of my life. 

And then she leaves again. She's drunk. I think about the risk she's taking; the last time I ever see my mother is going to be while she's screaming ""Never ask me for anything again,"" ""All I do is work my ass off,"" and things of that matter. And I get to thinking: If something happens, if she doesn't come back tonight, would I care? 

The answer right now is no. That could change. Maybe we'll once again ""kiss and make up,"" we'll blame it on her drinking, we'll leave it at that. We won't acknowledge her manipulation and abuse. 

Would it hurt if I lost her? If it did hurt; would it be because I love her? Or would it be because I lost something that had been ever present in my life?

I don't know. 

At this point, I'm trapped in an abusive household with nowhere to go but down. There is no looking up anymore, there is no reasoning or understandings to be had.

I've never wanted to run away from my own mother so badly. But at this point, she's changed. She's different. She will continue to hurt me and it will continue to eat away at my mind and I can't do anything to stop it. 

Great. ",07Apr2019,2
32,"Long story short, one of my best friends is going through an extremely rough patch and definitely needs professional help. He has told me he would have killed himself already but he was too scared to die. I have been trying to help him as best I can, but I don't know if it will be enough. 

We are juniors in college and he is on track to go to dental school. His plan is to get a military scholarship to pay for dental school, then serve for a few years while completing his residency. However, he thinks that his chances of getting said scholarship will be greatly diminished if he has a history of mental health issues, so he refuses to get professional help. 

Does anyone know if his chances will really be diminished or any advice on how to convince him that his mental health is more important than money? Any insight would be greatly appreciated, thank you.",07Apr2019,1
33,"It's a really edgy title, I know. However, I've just been extremely frustrated with myself lately. It's been really hard lately to motivate myself and find some sort of joy in my life. Somewhat recently, I've been getting a lot of help. I've been seeing a psychologist. My mother has been making leaps and strides to try and understand and help me. I've made friends and have been more social than I have ever been before. I'm just objectively a better person now than I was before. Yet this depression keeps hitting me like a ton of bricks every weekend. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, the thing that's bugging me is that I feel the only fuel I have left right now to keep going is to keep my head in the clouds. My head constantly comes up with these conspiracy theories on how I'm somehow special and significant in this world. Various scenarios include convincing myself that I have various superpowers. A ton involve ""The Truman Show"" type scenarios, where everyone knows what's going on except me. All of them have one thing in common: I'me special. I just need to wait until I have an ""inciting incident."" This life is just a prologue before something kickass and completely magical happens. In the end, I know that none of them are true. Although, it is always enticing to try and completely immerse myself in these delusions\*. 

&amp;#x200B;

To put it basically, I've been disappointed with my own existence. I get way too attached to fictional worlds and wanting to BE in them. Some nights, I go to sleep telling myself that I'll wake up in another life. I hate that my only way of feeling happiness is to chase after something that is objectively impossible to attain.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess it's not all bad. I've found going outside and walking more helps a lot. Seeing pretty views or even just the sky somehow kinda convinces my brain that there is a little magic in this world. It reminds me that there is something bigger than me out there that lies beyond what I see.

&amp;#x200B;

I really think that these delusions\* are all just a byproduct of me being stuck in my own head. It's just getting concerning since they don't seem to be going away anytime soon.

&amp;#x200B;

I also kinda feel like this feeling is something a lot of people could probably relate to, so it's something I've been trying to figure out how to express for a while now. I just don't know anyone that relates to me enough to understand what I'm trying to say. I'm also too afraid to really open up to anybody about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that the first response would be to ""go and make the magic you want to see in the world"" and that's certainly what I've been trying to do for years. I'm just kinda afraid that, at the rate I'm going, my dream goal would never be realized.

&amp;#x200B;

\*I know delusions are a serious symptom. I don't think that I'm delusional. It's just the best word I could think of.

&amp;#x200B;

PS I just realized. I already have talked about this feeling a ton of times through other reddit posts and other writings. Every time, I felt that they never truly conveyed what I was trying to say. I've noticed I've gotten better this time around. This has to be the first time where the words felt right.",07Apr2019,2
34," This may be long, but it is all 100% important/ relevant. 

My best friend invited me to come to Colorado to a wedding that she was officiating for a friend. When we got there, that is when I met Ken (Ken is a F2M trans person). Imagine a park ranger persona type of person, with tattoos, with a big smile on his face while having his hands on his hips and looking up at the sky. That's Ken. For the majority of the time, we hung out. It was very apparent that we had some interest in each other. One night, we laid on the mountain top, just staring at the sky, talking..laughing with one another.  He then told me passively about his gf, I was kinda bummed out, but enjoyed the friendship, and honestly..it felt healthy to at least be that and see what happens in the future. A few nights later, he asked me what I thought about polygamy. That was unexpected, and I never thought about it. I told him just that and he kinda shook his head and started talking about an old crush of his who broke his heart, who he didn't trust anymore (Sara). I listened to it all in stride, having a fun time..and obviously getting an interesting glimpse into his mind. 

The next few months there was a lot of texting/calling. Casual conversation. This whole time I wasnt sure what kind of relationship he had with Angela (gf). Was it open? Is there interest there? I admitted to him one night that I had a crush on him, he reciprocated and that changed things. I asked him about Angela and he told me he was looking to end things with her, but didnt want to hurt her feelings. I told him not to string her along, and he agreed. He said that she agreed to his need for 'free love', and she was aware of this. The next month I came to visit him at his place, to hang out...or I have no idea. Angela was there 90% of the time, she came over and he would 100% ignore me and get all cuddly and in the zone with her. I felt like I was entertaining myself, or in a uncomfortable situation. I mentioned it to him cause he seemed oblivious, and he told me she wanted to be there so he had to prove all was well to keep her happy. The one day she didnt come over he wanted me to sleep in bed with him and we had sex. He had said they had an open thing going, so I thought it was okay. After I mentioned the fact I liked the idea of a relationship with him and he got scared or...like he didnt want to go there Remember, free-love guy. The next night we all (Angela too) went to the gay club and he was alllllll over this guy there. He was talking to me about him like ""mmm I bet he is really fun ;) I got his number"". That night Angela spent the night with Ken and I slept on the air mattress.  The next night, I got a call from my mom saying that my dad unexpectedly took a turn for the worst and was intubated. I went back home the next day to find he was dying. He died later that night of severe sepsis with all us around him. The hardest moment of my life.

The next few months, me and Ken continued to talk. Him and Angela's relationship was still there, and he kept saying he was intending on ending it...but never would. Then he said he would wait till he got back from California (a trip she pre-planned to visit family/Ken to meet family). Like he procrastinated hardcore cause he didnt want to hurt her feelings. After the trip, he did message me to tell me that happened. I was glad and glad she isnt being strung along. She was PISSED at him. (true story, she is now married to Kens brother). 
Ken came down to my house and we hung out, went to a street dance, enjoyed each other, etc. We talked vaguely about me moving down. At this point, relationship talks were being made..and our interest in each other grew. About 2 days before I moved down Ken told me casually and with positive inflection that he got another room mate...the random guy that he really hit on/wanted to sleep with at the bar. I hung up on him lol. He called back like ""did you accidently hang up?""  I told him I wasnt going to be in that uncomfortable situation again and he reassured me it is just for extra cash and he had no interest. I accepted that. I moved down, and one of the first things I saw was a ton of photos of that Sara girl he previously talked about, in frames, etc. I got a little ill, but he assured me it meant nothing. Quickly Ken became emotionally attached to me, and I to him. He told me he was in love with me. He constantly told me, sometimes at random, sometimes if I asked...that he was not interested in polygamy anymore, that I am enough for him and he just wants me. He was totally uninterested in sleeping with or being with anyone else. At all. For the entire relationship, he intilled that if asked. A year later asked me to marry him...and for someone who was so afraid of commitment, that stunned me. Around this time, I felt my health anxiety perk up. I am a severe hypochondriac with PTSD like issues from excessive, past severe trauma. I am currently being evaluated, but multiple terms have been discussed. I have had this issue since I was 5 years old and it fluctuates or disappears based on current situation. My folks instilled that going to a therapist would land me in a padded room and threatened me with such A lot. They felt it was my duty to figure my own self out and manage it. So I always severely avoided talking to a professional. I told ken openly that I was a hypochondriac with severe anxiety issues and he was understanding. At this point, I hadn't had that side of me appear yet. 
About a month later, I was on Kens  computer for some purpose, I just can't remember what it was. I ended up getting on the internet and went to FB. He was still logged in and I kinda pondered for a minute. I saw he messaged Sara and it was suggestive. Like, talking bout how good she was ""with your fingers ;)"" (they had a minor sexual encounter previously) and other flirty things. The problem was this was RECENT. And she was discussing a trip to Hawaii with him or something. That night, I showed him that I did see his messages, asked what that was all about and I was pissed. He wanted to sit down with me and run through the conversation to clarify he meant nothing. And that it was harmless talk like they always had. That he was thinking about Hawaii, but wouldn't do anything or would segregate out cause he didnt trust her. Just as a means to get an awesome vacation for free. Sara was on my #1 radar at this point. I didn't even understand why he insisted on talking to her though he said she hurt him. I then did the worst thing. The worst thing I have ever done and to this day, I made a faux Sara account spiting me in order to get Ken to stop talking to her. I was a shit for it, a total shit. The whole thing did go through and he deleted her. I didn't feel good about it at all, why would I? I knew I had to admit to Ken that I did it, no matter the cost. I knew the consequences that it bore; leaving me, him talking to her again, getting kicked out, I don't know..but I was prepared for whatever it was, so I told him. His reaction was, like it wasnt a big deal. Like he appreciated I told him but he didn't seem hurt. He told me he didnt have any interest in talking to her anyways so he was going to just keep it that way. 
I was shocked, like, I was prepared for a shit fire, but it never came..and he never ever brought it up again after that. So s few months later my health anxiety kick really started to come into full swing. It coincided with the wedding stress and all compiled just was a really bad scene. I was a shell of myself. My interest, cooking, comedy, piano, composing.. it all stopped. All that existed was my fears. For the next few years the anxiety would come, go, come, go and it would be bad. I would be so mentally occupied, that my surroundings were murky. I would question my irrational health fears to ken which, initially he was fine with...but then it was a regular thing and he couldn't deal with it cause it was bogging him down...and me being that way, like I said, e verything was murky. His personal issues surrounding it werent getting addressed from me. If he were to talk about how he feels and I was all there to listen, it was often he would say something very painful about me or us that I didnt know how to respond other than ""is that how you really feel?"" or ""why do you feel that way?"" and because my reaction was more shock or mild sadness than acceptance, he perceived it as not prioritizing his feelings. I always go all out for his birthday or Christmas or even randomly..with concert tickets, etc making an elaborate dinner or cheesecake. I always tried to spoil him cause I have some urge to tangibly show I value his smiles, but maybe I have a problem identifying and assessing the way he emotes? He pushed me many times to go to a psychologist, and I would always put it off, try and get better on my own, fall back, and repeat. This is something that fluctuated depending on impending major events, or sometimes spontaneously.. I would do the health anxiety thing and he would push me to see someone. I kept meaning to but I just got clammy and scared over it. I tried so hard to keep it in myself and not burden him cause...I didn't want to burden him with it, I love him. Hes my husband, not a crutch..I need to walk with my two feet. I would internalize it all and then eventually ask him at some point. Throughout the on/off bouts..our lives were, good. We both worked at ACE together, a house, a great routine..and we genuinely enjoyed our time together. 5 out of 7 days Ken would wake up, then wake me up with a kiss on the cheek and a snuggle in bed, get in the car and go get breakfast sandwiches, drive to work, work, go to a restaurant after work, try and beat eachothers score in Cribbage, go home and watch Netflix in bed, sex, and cuddle to sleep. 5 nights a week for like...2 years. 
Then, his folks went on a road trip to boise and said they were looking to retire there. They wanted to fly Ken out the next day to look at homes with them cause they wanted us to move up there with them. I was unsure about this, I was comfortable where we were, but it was an opportunity to go somewhere better and with more options. Needless to say, they got the house and we all drove up in seperate cars.  1 week after (Jan 4 2019) Kens mom collapsed in the kitchen from an aneurysm. At first, we thought she was going to die and we all cried. She made it through tho..unscathed, which is rare. It was a long month in and out of the hospital for rehab for all of us, but she did amazing. She's back home and better...everyone is back to normal and stuff.

 I had severe suppressed anxiety from around February till now. A huge one. And Ken was at the end of his rope with it. We still did all the amazing cuddly, fun things together..enjoying each other but if my health anxiety seeped through, it ruined it. But through this all, h e always maintained that I was the one, he just doesn't want my anxiety, loves me, wants to be together, would never let me go...etc. This was literally 2 weeks ago that he told me all that. 
This last Tuesday was the big one. The big Kahuna.  Ken seemed odd. I couldn't put my finger on it. I asked him on Monday in bed what was going on, if he was distancing himself from me and he took a second and told me everything was fine and i was just imagining it. On Tuesday we went to eat dinner at some fancy restaurant, cracked some jokes, I asked him if he wanted to go do the $5 Tuesdays and he was all for that. Like totally excited, holding my hand, you know all the gooey lovely stuff. Which is normal and constant for us. I came home and gave him a kiss on the forehead as he was texting his best friend April and the text was something suggestive of me, but when I politely asked, he bold face lied to me saying it wasn't, I could tell he was lying and asked if it were really about me and he said ""well, yes"", ""well then why did you lie to me?"", ""cause I didn't want to start a fight before the movie"" and then I got angry, not cause he was talking to April about me (which isn't a state fucking secret, I really don't care) it was him lying to me. I blew up over it and that started this cataclysmic event. He went to the movie alone, and at the end of it texted me with this

""You've never believed how I felt about you. And you're right, I didn't know how to answer your question last night..thats why it took some time to think about. I am going to stop pretending that everything is okay cause it isn't. I don't want to sleep with you anymore, I don't want to do things with you anymore, you're not the person I want to be with. I gave you many chances to get help, I am done and I would like you to go""

You can probably imagine how I reacted, bawled like a baby. I called him making a complete ass out of myself saying he couldn't have meant that, he loves me, this cant be, I am sorry, I will fix this, I will go to a therapist, etc...and by god he just looked at me like ..get a fucking hold of yourself. I just lost it. He has never said that or ever even indicated EVER that he wanted that. Everytime, even weeks before he said he would never leave me, loves me too much, etc. On the way home I cried and apologized, and he just was like ""it's too late"".""I don't even know if I love you"","" you don't mean that"", ""yes, I do"" ""do you really want me to leave?"", ""YES"", ""for good?"", ""for now"". He went to bed as soon as he got home, not a tear, not a care, no reaction not even anger...just a fed up-ness. Once I got a hold of myself and processed it all, I wrote him an extensive text stating how I do need help, and I can't pretend any longer that I can deal with it on my own, and how I sure as shit can't use him as a crutch and that I don't blame him for being fed up with it, and to let me prove this and really do 120% by it. That it sucks I needed a massive push but I am going to do it and hope it betters myself as a standalone human cause I can't affect people like this, this bad. I wrote him basically that (summarized). He didn't respond the Wednesday, I contacted every single fucking therapist in town to get an appt in asap...and got one for Friday. My sister was resoundingly proud, (crying actually) that I am really going to do this, to find a way out of my own self. She'd only been pushing me for 20 years lol. I did everything I could to improve at least the quality of my day to help clear my head in all ways. I cleaned the kitchen, bathroom, myself, got a decent sleep schedule, made dinner. Was it all a show? No. It was a step to trying to improve my habits and get myself back to the person I am when I am normal. Ken came home, and seemed...jubilant...which is normal. Not to me, just with his day. The bizarre thing was him being sporadically extremely nice/normal to me but also very distant. I got 1 text from him ""I am glad you go an appointment, We'll see how it goes but I want space at home"". I respected that, and didn't bother him.

Thursday I also cooked, made cupcakes, got groceries, still giving him his space. At this point in my head... I honestly was hoping for the best and expecting the worst. I was done with the 'pining' 'please take me back' mindset and just...trying to find the positive in that, everything happens for a reason, and maybe my stubborn ass needed a slap to put me in the place I really need to be. So I actually in a small way, looked forward to my appt. I talked to my sister of course and she really, understood his need to distance himself, to say ""you know what? I am fed up, I can't do this and I don't trust you will really do this"" but made it clear that if I follow through and really give it my 120000% and he still wants a divorce cause there is nothing there, then that is really shitty. I talked to April that night who basically was like ""I think he is done, like no hope good ole' American try 'done'. I was really excited you were finally getting that help, I just don't think that hope was shared"". The next day was my appointment and fuuuuuuck. Sitting across from a woman staring at you, talking about your entire life story in order to be assessed was bad, I picked my fingers till they bled. She was very worried about PTSD, and it manifesting in some tangible way. Afterward though, it felt...okay. like, I did it, and I will continue to. When I got home, Ken was there. He started talking to me and I took that as it was safe to talk to him too. He was happy I really went, proud maybe..but wary. He was still in that 'place' but he was really seeing I am really trying and have been, and will continue to. He's in this ""we'll see how this goes"" but holds my hand kinda thing. He told me spontaneously then that he started talking to Sara again. My brain went blank. like the blankest stare into nothingness. Normally, I would be upset, but I was composed (but dying on the inside). He literally handed me his phone and said I am more than welcome to look at the texts. I was not ready for it. I just got Ken back and then this sunk me back to an even worse place. I read the texts and I literally could not believe my eyes.

""Why did you add me again?""

""I wanted to apologize for unfriending you years ago""

(proceeded to tell the entire story of when I made that fake account years ago, and how fucked up it was...the one I admitted to and he didn't even seem bothered by/said he didn't have any desire to talk to her anyway. Also told her I 'snooped' on their messages that time and it was totally ""fucked up""....the messages he literally encouraged i read through with and was understanding about and told me I was more than welcome to look at any of his stuff to prove he has nothing to hide )

""Omg! Why would you marry someone like that?""

""I contemplated calling it off when I found out, but I had too much money on the venue. I wanted to add you back all these years but I didnt want to make her mad, and I didnt know if it would really be you I was talking to you this time. I don't care what she sees anymore (see what?).""

""Don't worry, she's out of my life for good, how are you?""

(and literally the following is just a plethora of giddy 6-7am conversations with him talking about how beautiful the sunrise is there, etc and many phone calls.)

I was FUMED. I walked out to have a cigarette to try and compose myself. I asked him to come out and talk with me and basically he just confirmed that what he said about me was true, and to spice THAT up, was actually thinking about DIVORCE ""before"". I am like ""but you love me"" him: ""many people in love get divorced"" me: ""but you literally said 2 weeks ago we were meant to be..like always"" Him: *shrugs* me: ""You literally didn't want to be with me ever again??"" Him: ""the other day yes, but now (holds my hand, kisses my forehead) lets see what happens, cause I love you and I am glad you are going to a therapist, i want to make this work..but I can't live like this"". Then later he got defensive cause now all the sudden, it went from "" I don't have any desire to talk to Sara anymore"" years ago to ...now ""You don't have any right to dictate who I can and can't talk to"" merely because I verbatim said ""I am going to try and be okay with the Sara thing. It hurts, i hate it, I don't understand it, but I am trying here"". I told him it seems kinda odd he added her after all of these years right when he decided he didn't want me and he just shrugged his shoulders and said it doesn't mean anything and he wanted to apologize to her cause he felt bad. They are just friends. He doesn't think anything he did is wrong and it fundamentally is and feels wrong.  I had no idea about him contemplating marriage over something I literally admitted to him I did and chose to accept those kinds of consequences. Something he laid it to rest when I told him. He's talking about it to her like it did irreparable damage and was a huge thing. I thought it was at first, he said it wasnt.   Talking about how terrible of a person I am and just discarding me.  I read these things and it hurts cause he'd be romantic, sweet, and giving to me...through it all? How could he say those things? I have him back, kinda. Now he is in a...'it is going to take some time to earn my trust back but I want the anxietyless you cause I love you and I am proud you will get help' mode. I am going to continue to do my part, to do me, to fix myself...but like...I feel just...I don't even know. The Sara thing is extremely uncomfortable...and I don't know if that is something that I am overreacting over or he really is not doing right.

35,"I’m 20/F and I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety since I was 11. So many times in the past I thought I’ve reached my breaking point, and each time I was able to talk myself out of it, but with each and every time I get a little bit closer to it and this time I don’t know if I can talk myself out of it. Life is so unbearable at points. I have no idea what I’m doing or where I’m going, I’m thousands in debt from trying to find my path, I have no motivation for school anymore and I can’t do the work anymore, I’m still living with my mom and she is her own brand of suffocation in my life, and my family... I don’t even have the energy to get into that. And I know that none of these things seem that bad or like they could all be easily fixed, but it always seems that when I try to change anything I always end up making everything so much worse for myself, and sometimes those around me. People say it gets better, but I’ve been struggling for a fucking decade and nothing ever gets better, there are just new problems and they are so much worse than the old ones. I don’t know what to do anymore. I hate life and I hate myself for not being better but I don’t how to be better. I don’t know how to keep going. And the worst part is I don’t even want to die, but it’s getting so hard to find the point in living anymore.

Yes I have a tendency towards depression and have dealt with pretty severe anxiety in the past, but I have a girlfriend, good (but stressful job), so things are pretty good, so I don't know if this is depression or if this is just the way I feel and that's all?

39,"I am a 29 year old Male who was diagnosed with Borderline Personality in his teens. My life has been an insane rollercoaster of dramatic highs and crushing lows. Ever since I was young I would have intense, tactile thoughts of killing myself. To the point where I could almost feel the knife or rope. Sometimes these intense thoughts would come out of nowhere, like in the middle of a conversation with a friend. I also have flashbacks to some of the many traumatic events I have endured in my life with seemingly no trigger. 
Two months ago a girl I was dating came home drunk and violently assaulted me. Really beat me up. And then broke up with me after sending a deluge of the meanest messages I have ever received from a person. In a fit of panic I quit my jobs and tried to drive to Alaska, but failed. I came back home feeling like an utter disgrace. I have been drinking every day for three weeks straight. I have worked very hard to find a job but nothing has come up. I am living on my best friends charity and I may be at the lowest point in my life. 
Today I put my loaded pistol to my head, one in the chamber, safety off. I don't think I was going to pull the trigger, but I wanted to look at myself in the mirror with a gun at my head to see what it felt like.
I don't know if I can take myself seriously, and I've suffered so much damage to my pride that I am paralyzed at the thought of seeking help. Even talking to my mother makes me feel sick to my stomach and just want to run away.

41,This is mostly just to vent post. So I found out the other day that my primary care doctor who handles all of my medicines has switched to another facility. Unfortunately it's a specialty facility that I would have no reason to go to. So this doctor is the first person I ever opened up to about my mental health. She's the first one I ever told about the self harm. There's something better that I just really trusted. I felt like I could be completely candid and vulnerable with her and honestly that was probably the best. The first time I was ever able to do that with somebody in the medical profession. Really somebody anywhere. Well I had gone on new medicine earlier this year and she wanted me to check back in in about a month or so and do a follow-up appointment. So I called yesterday to make the follow-up appointment because the medicine I'm on is making me so exhausted and I really don't see any difference other than sapping my energy. I don't need to feel more tired. That's all beside the point. I called up there and find out that she is not there anymore. And now I have to see somebody new. I'm really scared. And I'm angry. And I feel betrayed. And I know that nothing is personal. I know that no decisions were made because of me. I'm not so self-centered or righteous to believe that. But it hurts. I know that the personal relationship issues come from borderline personality disorder and I know that the fear of change is probably the bipolar feeling of Abandonment is probably the bipolar. At this time I don't know what's what or what to blame where. I just know that I didn't expect to feel so upset. I didn't expect feels. Like I've lost somebody. Like they've died. It's such a weird feeling. This is why for so many years I never got close to anybody. I never developed relationships with people. They always go away and there's always this feeling. I know that everybody's advice would be to try to give this new person a chance and be as open and candid with them. That it may turn out wonderful. But it's really really hard. I did that once 10 twelve years ago. And they went away and I never did it again. And then just a couple of months ago I decided that I needed some help. And I'm right back to where it was. I'm sorry if this is rambling I'm sorry for any format this is in or any misspellings. I just didn't realize I would be crying so much. If anybody has gone through a situation like this. If anybody can relate to this anger and fear and devastation over something so minuscule over somebody who I didn't know that well but confided so much into I'd love to hear how you got through it.

42,"For years now, I’ve been feeling extremely uncomfortable with myself, not like I’m ashamed about my personal appearance but feel like something is restraining me, that something I believe is my skin. It’s like wearing something new and realizing it doesn’t fit you or you forgot about the price tag and annoys you but can’t do anything about it. I try to move my shoulders as if by doing this my skin will get loose and I’ll have enough space to fell comfortable. The feeling is always there but I can ignore it most of the time, but whenever I’m stressed, tired or thinking about this, the feeling gets worse and I literally want to tear my skin apart, just rip it, expecting as if living without epidermis might make me feel okay.
My skin is starting to feel itchy, and the thought of doing this starts to grow again. I know I won’t do it, but I’m scared of having this thoughts inside my head, because now that I wrote this I realized that I think I’ve grown to big for my own skin and if I get just a little bit bigger, just by doing exercise or getting a littler bit fatter or taller my skin may not hold it any longer and end up exploding.

43,"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost two years and he has tried committing suicide twice. Both times I thankfully talked him out of it. He suffers from PTSD from the Army and severe depression that has been going on for awhile; even before I met him. The first time he tried committing suicide I took him to the VA and they were able to give him new medication and put him into AA and another form of therapy. He was doing good for a few months until just a few days ago. I couldn’t get ahold of him for awhile and when I finally did he was very drunk and on his way to his cabin to kill himself. I spent an hour on the phone with him and successfully talked him out of it. But now he doesn’t want to go to the VA to get help. He believes that he’s tried everything, and that nothing else is going to help. He’s completely given up and doesn’t see any reason to keep on living. 

I personally have gone through extreme suicidal thoughts in the past, and I deal with severe anxiety and I also have depression and a history of self harming. I’m no stranger with suicidal/depressive thoughts, so I can understand to a certain degree how he’s feeling. 

I know that I can only do so much until he has to help himself/want help. But I know that if I stop pushing him to get help, he is going to end his life. Does anyone have any advice on how I can help him besides encouraging him to get the help he needs?

48,"Fair warning, this is the culmination of around nine months worth of bottled up anxiety and depression so this post might be a little lengthy. 

&amp;#x200B;

In August of last year I started University not too far from where I graduated high school. Coming in, I thought my life would see a drastic improvement in the social department. In the first month I was able to make a few new friends, find a rhythm, and generally contain the chaos that is normally running through my head. However, by the end of the fall semester I found that the social skills I though I had been developing were rapidly deteriorating. I noticed that, on the rare occasion I was invited out with friends, I would be immediately overwhelmed with anxiety, even though I would want to go out and be social. Really any attempt to socialize with people became coupled with this overwhelming anxiety. Because of this, by the start of the spring semester I only had the energy to keep up circumstantial relationships; my roommate (H) and his girlfriend (K) that practically lives in our dorm, in this case. For a little while I thought this was healthy enough for me.

Fast forward now to about a month ago. Spring semester is finally coming to an end, the dorms are preparing to shut down for the summer, and everyone is trying to find a place to live once this happens. H, K, their friend M, and I had all been planning to rent a house together to cut rent cost and to have long-term housing for Uni. A few weeks ago we end up finding the perfect place, and apply for the lease. About a week later we hear back from the landlord who tells us they can't move our application forward. After hearing this, H, K, and M started to look for places large enough only for the three of them. At this point none of them have definitively communicated their new plan to me, and I am too socially anxious to even know where to start that conversation without freaking myself out. Plus, after this all came out, it has felt like our relationships (especially with H) have become very strained.

This whole ordeal has left me to realize just how reclusive I have become. It feels like I've lost all ability to forge new relationships with people, and that I don't have any other friends to turn to. That, coupled with the fact that I need to find a place to live within the next month, has put me in my worst mental shape in about two years. I'm lost, stressed, and could really use some help, Reddit.",07Apr2019,1

But I have these episodes in the last 5 years where I feel an overwhelming sadness, or just plain miserable. Perhaps it's hormonal, sometimes I get really bad PMS. But sometimes the episodes get so bad. Sometimes I cry my heart out for hours without a specific trigger, sometimes I don't know exactly how I feel, but I feel like I have to cry to feel better but the tears won't come.

I dont feel bad for myself too much during the day but it is there from time to time or sometimes the existential sadness arrives and it goes like this: ""that life has no meaning and is a cycle of suffering, some day my family will die out and leave me alone and old and what, what, I should have wife and kids by that time, right? But what if I don't have the money for a family or it will just never work out for me, or she divorces me, or maybe when I finally have the moneyand the family I will still not feel food about myself? Dude, you are hitting 30, you are too old for a career change and why if life is suffering and you will ve still miserable even if you do it"" etc. So the existential sadness just stops me from learning Html, going to the gym, planning my vacation abroad, then the afternoon is spent laying around ny room and/or drinking beer and at the end I hate myself for the wasted day not being productive and just being a piece of shite.

I can find a way to make something gloomy no matter how much it's not. I recently started doing some physical activity for some mood uplifting, and now all I can think of is how terrible I am at it compared to others, even though I'm progressing, very slowly though. I'm asking this because every time I go seek help from a therapist, I get told that I'm okay, and that it's just a phase because of what I'm going through in life right now. While this could be true, it does not give me a solution. I have a friend I talk to about these things. He has helped me cope a lot, or so I think. Recently, all I think about is that I am such a burden for talking too much about myself to him, probably ruining his mood for my own sake.

She doesn't know what it's like to be an addict but she is really worried and scared about my life. But idk, she triggers the living  hell out of me. I just managed to eat once a day without trowing up and that's a huge thing for me. However while dinner she has no better thing on mind than to ask her boyfriend how many calories that sauce has, wow. When she finds my binge trash like chocolate paper and shit she literally puts it onto my bed to make sure I see SHE saw me /found my leftovers. That's like putting empty beer bottles onto an alcoholics bed.
She doesn't eat enough herself, her intake may be beweern 1000-1200 on good days. I mean we a know what an actually healthy person needs to eat and she usually just has breakfast and then dinner is half a breadbun and some crisps as a snack. That's insane. However saying she has an Ed will instantly make her go ' yeah you always make out in your head how it's the others not you, but it's obvious that it is YOU'

I Really I want to be OK with my mum. But she does so many things that hurt me and when I try to make that clear it always ends up in a discussion, a fight and my face hitting a wall because ' I am the sick one' like... I don't deserve a Pont of view???

I'm going inward in May and I've waited 4years to be ready for a therapy again and, 7 Months for a place in the best clinic in Germany ( yeh my english ain't perfect lol) and I DO want to get better, seriously km done with this shit. But my mum triggers me so much. Emotionally but also body wise. I don't want to lose her and get so distant again because in the times we had no contact at all, I was the u happiest person on earth. Idk how to go on. Nomather how hard I try we end up fighting and even if I'm doing great steps forward and challenge myself, she still puts spotlight on the bad habits. And that hurts so so mu h...

I have seen them go to each others houses quite a lot but I have never been invited or told about anything. I have never been invited to a party or someone's birthday. I have told a few of these people about my hobbies and because it takes a while to explain details that I love about them I ask them to search them up. I sometimes remind them through social media. They act like me asking them never happened and I don't know why but I just feel... invisible, like I don't matter, like I'm just a 'backup person' if they have no one to talk to.

Making choices I am not comfortable with. Caring about people who are too good for a person like me. I am alone, so alone in this hard, isolating world. There is no one to hold my hand and tell me it is okay. I feel like human but I act as if I am not. I feel dead but alive enough to witness my own soul-less, life-less body, as if a robot who feels too much programmed to be alone.

My chest is empty. My stomach is deep and shallow. The people I love don’t care about me. They never do. They just pretend. Say words they don’t mean. And just be there, waiting for me to form emotional connections, and then reject me as a human. It’s like they are torturing me, as if they have all planned to slowly torture me.

&amp;#x200B;

My issue is that I feel immensely guilty over the tiniest of things that I don't even have control over. Someone arrives late to class and gets told off; **guilty**. Half the class forgets the assignment hand in, the lecturer say's how this is unacceptable; **guilty**... even though I have handed in already. Goes to job interviews and the person interviewing me has had a rough morning with work or whatever, so they seem a little on edge or tired during the interview; **guilty**. I talk about my mental health to someone who is open about listening and they don't like what I'm saying or are bored by it; **guilty**. Watching a nature documentary and David Attenborough is talking about how humanity has doomed this species because of an event that happened 50 years ago; **guilty**. I see a twitter argument about how X isn't presented in Y, and how white males are to blame; **guilty**.  

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot stop feeling like this; it's like clockwork. The smallest things that bother others, or makes them express disappointment or sadness, has a knock-on effect on me - which in turn makes me feel sad or disappointed, so the cycle just loops around of us being miserable. 

&amp;#x200B;

He's manipulateive and assures you that everything will be fine and yada yada but then sneaks up and stabs you in the back, if you haven't seen my post on pcmr here is a TL:Dr 

I have depression and probably anxiety attacks my dad makes them worse and in that case broke my pc after I lashed out on him
After all of that he says it's my fault for having anxiety attacks and thinking like I do.

After all of that (about 14 days ago as the time of writing) I'm rebuilding it I have had offers from some very generous people and will hopefully get the pc working this week, but! As well as destroying my pc he destroyed my:
 keyboard headset power connectors to monitor and PSU display port and maybe monitor.

I think it's reasonable for him to replace the things that HE destroyed but he thinks I should 
Since it was me that had the anxiety attack.


As for my anxiety I cant really be spontaneous and do things on a whim it needs a lil bit of planning beforehand remember this and that be KNOWS this 

So we where going to my mom's grave, reasonable right? His idea and all, it was just going to be about 30 minutes and in my head I had 30 minutes, I planned for 30 minutes.
But then my dad says ""oh yeah and we'll be going on a hour walk then go shopping and eating after that"" you might think this is nice and all I also think so, just that I planned for 30 minutes not 2 and 1/2 hours I began to panic and began asking if we could plan this out better at home, the shit stain said ""well I do the deductions here not you, all right?"" And then he mumbles ""you always do this for, fucks sake...""

I began panicing a bit more and tried to argue with him but you know what it's like ""I'm you're father and I decide what we do"" it ended with my dad and my brother's whent to eat and buy something for them (most of it was for my dad because, of course it was) and me sitting in the car browsing Reddit

For the last 2 months you can clearly see that has depression...He works in the morning and forenoon while he still got energy. Afternoon and in the evening he spends time either sleeping in his bed or watching TV. He also has a tendency to poison himself with so called conspiracy theories at time to time. He even lost appetite and with that he lost weight. Physically he is lazy, he does not want to go to the gym or at least somewhere for a walk. It would be ok but his job is not physically demanding. When it comes to family, he has a careless and selfish mother and no one else because his parents didn't bother to accomplish good family relations...So social activity = basicly zero, excluding work.

Remembering for you…I had a vision not of just me, of you.

&amp;#x200B;

*My name is not important.*

**Your name** is important, don’t forget you’re all important.

&amp;#x200B;

Never take a life. If you can. Never.

Life is love

Life is happiness.

&amp;#x200B;

Experience life, experience love, get a friend, get a companion, get married. 

if you become separated, this can happen, it’s sad but that is love.

Sometimes it does end so we can start loving again.

&amp;#x200B;

Find a path follow it, if it scary, find a new path follow that. Life has infinite paths, pick a positive one please. or I won't see you again.

&amp;#x200B;

Listen to music, hear the sadness, hear the happiness it’s rare but you can hear it.

&amp;#x200B;

Look into eyes, stare into them, stare into souls, connect your soul with another stare, stare, love life. Bond. see. Listen.

&amp;#x200B;

Find some food you love

Cook it, 

Eat it, 

Enjoy it

if you didn't enjoy it try something else, don't worry if you don't like much. find some stuff and eat it in moderation. 

This step is hard. If you have a lot of love to give and not a lot to receive. But your health is important.

&amp;#x200B;

Be brave, unlike me I’m scared, I’m tall yet small. Be tall for me please you can be small in height but tall in soul. Protect giants, don’t be scared of us. I’m scared of me.

&amp;#x200B;

*I’m lucky, I found my protector she is my wife, she is tall for me.*

&amp;#x200B;

Don’t be racist. This goes both ways. You could be black, you could be white. I can explain this to you. if you want to listen...

&amp;#x200B;

Have kids if you want them not to fill a gap in time but because you have love to give. It hard having kids because you want to protect them, if your a giant like me that especially difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

You are not a number but you are a number, be proud of your name, someone who loved you gave you that name which isn’t a number. Feel sorry for those called Jr, they’re fathers have mapped their lives already, they didn’t get to be a child.

&amp;#x200B;

This isn’t a post, it a story I know more than you can ever know, I remembered everything about us. I won’t reply to comments. But I will reply to your heart. If something sad has happened to you 

&amp;#x200B;

throughout my life i’ve struggled significantly with OCD, anxiety, and PTSD. but generally i find myself to be someone who works quite hard to look on the bright side and work through legitimate struggles with a hopeful mindset.

But this is probably the third or fourth time in my life where I’ve realized that i’m mostly or only in significant daily contact with people for whom “it’s always something,” can never look on the bright side, and rely on me to constantly cheer them up and provide evidence that life isn’t all terrible. i believe that a lot of this traces back to my father, who was and is very much this type of person, and relied on me even as a young child to “cheer him up.” My current SO and all of my closest friends are all the same types, and every time the littlest thing goes wrong it’s a day or week long process of coming out of it—and I’m mainly responsible for doing the emotional labor of all of it. (for example, My SO and i recently went to couples therapy, and it was me who decided we should go, found the therapist, booked the appointment, paid the co pay, and insisted that we keep going—if it had been up to him, we would’ve just kept having rhe same fights over and over about how everything is terrible and will never improve). 

Does anyone have any resources i could consult about how to break this cycle and stop being this emotional support system for people like this? Any books/blogs/anything? i feel so lonely and drained, and constantly like other people’s problems take precedent over my own—like it’s my personal burden to convince people everything isn’t terrible and worthless.

My girlfriend(18f) and I(19m) have been dating for almost 3 years. Over the past year, I've notice her increasingly biting her nails. At first I thought that this was just a harmless bad habit, but for the past few months she's been biting the skin around her nails to the point where they're bloody and hurt. I think this may be Dermatophagia, which from wikipedia is "" a compulsion disorder of gnawing or biting one's own skin, most commonly at the fingers. ""

I've been trying to support her in anyway possible. I've done some research and introduced her to subreddits like r/calmhands . She has tried to paint her nails and stop, but every time a stressful event in her life happens, her hands get destroyed. Recently, she's started biting her lips in addition to her hands, and she's leaving abrasions on her lips as well. I don't know if this is the right thing to do, but I've tried to get her to seek therapy. However, she always refuses and often seems to regress into joking about it in order to mitigate my concern. Her mom scolds her about it, but doesn't seem willing to do anything to help her. They have the money for therapy, and she could even get it for free through her University, so cost isn't really a factor.

 How should I approach this? From what I've researched, if left untended, this particular affliction can have terrible long term effects.  I really love her, and I really want to help her, but I'm unsure on how to do so.

We’re 3 Brits who have experienced a range of mental health issues. Our experiences range from mild anxiety and depression to dropping out of school and university due to agoraphobia and extreme anxiety.

In our lives we’ve been trying various things to get better and thought working on something together would be good for us.

Counter intuitively we’re all quite optimistic about the future for humans so our experiment is a YouTube channel that discusses the future, history, economics, current events and other things to help educate others.

Alex – records the audio, and help script and research

Seb - does the video and audio editing

Joel – helps research and script and find video material

We’ve found it helpful in motivated us, getting us on track and boosting our moods and have had some great positive feedback.

We thought we’d put the word out and ask if anyone else would like to be involved in our little collective to see if it might help you too.

Getting involved would be as easy as PMing me, hearing about how we’ve done things so far and then saying what you might be interested in helping with. Maybe putting ideas out for topics or getting involved in research and/or script writing.

104,"Hey guys. In retrospect, I've been dealing with these weird feelings since around December/January, but I've only really started considering that I might have a real issue in the past month or so. If anyone else has experienced these same feelings and it led to dysthymia, major depression, any type of anxiety, etc. please lmk your thoughts.

\-**Lack of social interest:** Decreased desire to socialize, this has led me to be far less outgoing and motivated to meet with new ppl than I used to be.  Almost feels like I just don’t have the energy to socialize with new people.  
\-**Decreasing social skills:** Due to less frequent and less enthusiastic socializing, I feel that my social skills have decreased because It's harder for me to genuinely be interested in conversations.  Harder for me to be as clever, enthusiastic and charismatic as I once felt.  Ofc, this leads to a negative spiral of not wanting to socialize, and even worse social skills.  
\-**Decreased libido:** Additionally, decreased libido/interest in talking w girls.  Libido's Still there, and can get intense at times. It's just consistently far less than what It used to be…no idea why.  
\-**Always feeling discontent:** Persistent feeling or mild discontent and inability to just enjoy stuff as much as I felt like I used to.  For example, watching TV shows, listening to music, movies all feel more “bland” now and harder to really enjoy.  
Because of this, I often find myself not looking forward to things I believe I used to.  For example, seeing friends, parties, the weekend, going home after school, etc. because I know I’ll feel discontent and sorta uneasy/unsatisfied that whole time  
\-**Exhaustion/sleep craving:** I find myself just craving sleep far more often than I have in the past, and getting up earlier seems to have gotten even more difficult. I literally fantasize so often about being able to sleep in.  
\-**Sleep difficulties:** Unfortunately…sometimes, I have trouble sleeping.  I’ll frequently have random (not really disturbing thoughts, just random and racing) when I go to bed at like 11:30 on weeknights.  Then before I know it, it’s 12:45 and I’m still wide awake cuz of these random thoughts.  
\-**Adderall not as effective:** Adderall doesn’t seem to provide the motivational boost, slight wellbeing and focus enhancement that it did last year.  It can actually amplify bad moods and anxious thoughts, with less effectiveness at blocking out negative distractions  
\-**IBS:** In October, I was diagnosed w/ IBS, which I know is potentially linked to anxiety/depression\\

105,"Hey all! This is being written in the midst of a mild panic attack so if I sound nuts, please forgive me.

I’m currently in a pretty bad spot, but slowly getting out of it over the course of the last 7 days or so. I’ve been on Zoloft from when I was about 17 till now, and I’m 27 (yikes!). It has always helped. I know how I feel when I’m on Zoloft and I know how I feel when I’m off Zoloft and it’s way worse. Here’s the thing. Over the last 4 years or so, I’ve been very inconsistent about taking my pills. I moved out across the country from where I grew up after graduating college and have been on my own with no one to remind me to take my pills. So what that’s looked like is maybe taking 4 pills a week? Sometimes only 1 or two? It’s bad. And I just realized how bad I’ve been about it. I went through a scary time a little while ago where my insurance wasn’t going to pay for my Zoloft refills so i started strategically stockpiling my pills without any guidance from a psychiatrist (because he would just refill it and I was too ashamed to tell him about any of this). I think I might have wrecked some havoc on my already pretty “off” brain.

I went through and am still going through a pretty intense bout of health anxiety and dissociation and intrusive thoughts of suicide this week and my new psychiatrist put me on Rexulti, an anti psychotic and I’ve been consistent about my Zoloft usage for about 4 weeks now which is good. I’ve been feeling MUCH better, but in the last 4 days I’ve been waking up with anxiety and nothing to feel anxious about. Just the feeling in my stomach. And I can’t seem to stop moving when I lay down. I also woke up screaming from a nightmare the other night. It tends to go away once I start moving around but it’s scared me a lot. 

I’m just asking if this is normal when you’re starting to take Zoloft consistently. Has anyone else gone through this kind of thing and gotten better? Please tell me you have.

107,"I was officially diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder on Christmas day 2017. I was initially prescribed Zyprexa after that diagnosis, and I took the medication for about four months before I stopped. I quit because the effects of the medication we're numbing my mind to the point that I couldn't have an original thought. I began to take cannabis to help me go to sleep and relieve anxiety. It seemed everything was going well. I had a good job at the airport, my roommates were living in harmony, and I was having decent conversations with people. 

Then on December 2018, I stopped taking cannabis because I was offered a job that required me to take a drug test. Unfortunately, I was unable to sleep properly for a month. I believe I was in a manic phase at this point because I thought I could take on a high stress customer service position. Taking on this position plus not sleeping caused me to have major anxiety attacks during job training. I quit the job and started taking Zyprexa again. I was really down in the dumps at this point and decided mixing alcohol with the Zyprexa to help me get to sleep. It got to the point where I didn't want to do anything anymore, and I lost my will to live. Luckily, my family intervened and got me to go to a new psychiatrist. The psychiatrist put me on Latuda. It made me manic, so I was put on Seroquel.

It is now my fourth day on 25 mg of Seroquel. My question is: have I totally fucked up my brain chemistry? What is your take on psychiatric medication?  What should I do to become a functional adult again? 


TLDR: I'm bipolar and have been on and off psych meds for a year and a half. I'm currently on Seroquel. Is my brain chemistry destroyed beyond repair?",07Apr2019,3
109,"At the start of 2019, I ended a short relationship with a guy. He himself was a good dude and very supportive. Although I was head over heels for him before we confessed and started going out, when the relationship started, everything shifted. I no longer wanted to talk, and I hated how he called me pretty or beautiful or smart. I guess being put on a pedestal is what bothered me. Anyway, I couldn't stand being physically close either. I felt like I was burning up from a fever and I couldn't have any space. Anyway, I broke it off. For the first couple of months afterwards, everything about him annoyed me. I've slowly gotten past that. But, now, I can't even begin to explain how my mental health has plummetted. I can't look at myself in the mirror or think about myself when I was with him. I feel nervous talking to other guys whom I suspect may be into me. I can't even marry people in Stardew Valley, my favourite game of all time without feeling deeply unsettled. I realize how much I love being by myself, and not close to anybody in particular. No need to communicate every day or often with somebody. But, I want to be close with my friends. However, my core is just unsettled. The one thing that really makes me anxious is not even going about virtual romance in games. It may seem silly but I don't think it's considered natural to feel uncomfortable by marrying a chunk of pixels. I don't understand what my feelings are. I want to understand. Does anybody or has anybody experienced something similar? ",07Apr2019,1

I've been diagnosed with anxiety a bit over three years ago.

She keeps wanting to talk about it and wants to hear about my experiences , which I have shared more than once, but I can't anymore, because thinking/talking about it makes me have attacks and need medication (still in moderation). I beat it three years ago by focusing on family and work and ignoring ""the issue"". I am still on that same path, but thinking it away does not help now. How did you guys do it?

118,"About 10 years ago my Doctor gave me samples of the name brand Wellbutrin XL. It worked beautifully for me and I considered it a miracle drug for my depression symptoms. After about 3 weeks I ran out of the name brand samples and was given the generic Bupropion XL when it came time to get a prescription filled. 

After about a week or two on the generic, I came down with a strong allergic reaction (hives itching redness). For years I tried to find an alternative to Wellbutrin with no luck.

Any progress I've made battling my depression without medication has been shortlived. In the past couple of years, my depression has gotten progressively harder to manage. I visited an allergy specialist who said that my allergic reaction could be due to  the inactive ingredients in the generic pills, but of course there could still be a risk taking the name brand Wellbutrin.

121,"tl;dr: my friend shared his discovery with me that my not-really ex had deceived not only me, but of him and another friend as well. he had been emotionally manipulative and inconsistent with his stories to us.

So backstory to all of this: 

For a period of almost six months, I was in a relationship with a guy. We both had mutual feelings for one another (or at least, I hope so) but neither of us wanted to commit solidly to a relationship since he was going to be going on a year-long student exchange program at the end of the summer following our sophomore year. We *did*, however, all the things that a typical couple would do-- cuddling, hand-holding, the whole ""i love you"" thing, etc. Just without the title of boyfriend and girlfriend.  And to be fair, I thought it was fine because all I craved was for someone to care for me in the way the parents never do.

January to February of 2019, I suffered the worst depressive episode I've ever had to date. I made a plan to kill myself on March 5th and almost carried out the plan earlier than expected when something very bad happened to me. I called him, of course, on the night I meant to kill myself. This was January 30th. I don't regret doing so because I otherwise might not be here to share my story, but he failed to follow up on me. He just vanished and our everyday texting habits with one another did as well. Foolishly, I hoped that maybe he was doing so it order to give me some space and everyday, I waited hopefully for a text that never came.

March 2019, I'm starting to go back to my normal mood patterns, which consist of something I really can only describe as an overwhelming feeling of neutrality and happiness at the same time. I could have gotten hit with a bus and it would have done nothing to my mood whatsoever. He has started to hang out with another girl in one of my classes, and I dismissed it as pure friendliness because he's that type of guy. A social person. However, I got an overwhelming feeling of jealousy whenever I saw them conversing with one another and even more so when I accidentally saw that he had been texting her instead of me. I did nothing about it, though, because I simply felt it wasn't my place to dictate the actions of someone who I had never been officially committed to in the first place. That didn't make it hurt any less, but somehow I still found myself to not care.

Now, I just found out that he intended on bringing her to a study group with a friend of mine (who will be there with her boyfriend). I'll admit that I am somewhat jealous of my friend as well, but because she has found a solid and stable sort of happiness that I failed to find in the months I spent with a boy who wasn't really mine. Upon learning that, I immediately cancelled my plans to join them. And in a slightly annoyed state, I texted a different friend of mine about the situation.

My friend shared with me the texts that he had with this guy. In them, this guy stated to him that the girl he was with now was someone ""he truly felt in love with"" and that ""he was willing to love unconditionally"". Naturally, I got angry, as he had said these things to *me* while I was at a point in my life when I was emotionally vulnerable and thirsty for any sign that someone out there cared for me. As we conversed, we discovered that he had shared a similar sentiment to a friend of mine and additionally told her that they could not date because he was going to be out of the country. 

I felt cheated and angry. But at the same time, relieved, because knowing for sure that he wasn't the person I thought I knew gave me a sense of closure. I, after all, couldn't have broken up with him if there had been nothing to break. It felt like a door closed on something and for the first time, I felt my dependency on him melt away. I don't need him to be strong. I can stand on my own.

122,"I'm planning to schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist that was recommended to me in an intervention centre where I went for support during a particularly difficult period in my life - I have no written note or recommendation from the centre. The psychologist in the centre briefly suggested I might have some type of personality disorder and recommended I see a psychiatrist and a therapist.  

  

I am struggling in a number of areas of my life and during my previous attempts at therapy it was very difficult for me to pinpoint what exactly I needed helping with, because I always felt like I had to pick one (feeling depressed/anxiety and panic attacks/self-harm/inability to maintain relationships/the list could go on). However, after having done some research, I think it's likely I have a borderline personality disorder.  

  

My question is - is it OK to tell the new psychiatrist I think I might have BPD, despite never being officially diagnosed? I don't want to sound like I'm self-diagnosing or looking for quick answers, but since I find myself meeting most of the symptoms I thought it might give them a rough idea about what I'm struggling with.

124,"After starting over the beginning of this post way to much, I now just start writing what comes to my mind. So sorry if this is messed up and for my english.

Well, first of all I (20M) think, that I hate myself. But at this point I can't figure out why exactly. So, it's not really abou my body, even though I wouldn't say I'm attractive. It is more about my character and the way I think. As an example. I hate to talk about myself. But here I sit - writing just about me. I hate it, but I keep doing it. Even in conversations it feels to me like an topic I can't avoid. And then there are my thoughts. Often I have to tell myself, that myy person and character ist not what I think in the first moment. And with this the discussion in my head starts. 

It's this discussion that's constantly in my head. Arguing about my feelings and thoughts. Are they real and are they mine? Do I imagine or even wish to think like I do it? Am I really sad/lonely or do I want to feel like that? 

If I try to change the view on my life, there is no real point to why I should/could think like that. It's more like the opposite. I finished school with acceptable grades, I study and live pretty independently. I love my friends and they do the best for me and I got a good relation to my parents. Nonetheless I find myself way to  often in my bed and sleeping half the day or just arguing with myself. 

When I am out with other people I try to be nice and polite. I try to follow them with their conversations and to remember personal information (e.g. Things they like). But after conversations the disscussion starts. Did I talk to much/less? Were my words appropriate? I would really love to hear and learn more about the people surrounding me, but these thoughts take my energy and often I can't remeber what people said. Even worse to me ist the fact, that I can't cheer up people. Even though it is kind of my job (social work).

I feel all of the symptoms listed pretty regularly, and have done since some time in secondary school. I'm 26 now.

I regularly feel worthless, stupid, struggle to do things, think about killing myself or wish I was dead quite frequently. I go through periods where I don't eat much, or can't remember anything, and avoid doing anything new or uncertain. I went through a phase of self harming when I was 24 - 25 so I could sleep at night, and have a few scars on my arms and legs.

I used to work in a hospital, and a patient died which upset me a bit. I got 8 sessions with a clinical psychologist, but after two sessions she said there was need to see her, because she could only offer CBT, and she believed I already thought that way?

I have a good job and I'm happily married to a woman who lets me be alone for hours when I feel rubbish, even if I feel that way for a long time. These days I can usually push through my lethargy and indecision, especially at work, although I find it harder to do at home.

My whole life I liked to 'Stan' (be a big fan of) celebrities and youtubers. That's normal, of course. Some are incredibly inspiring and amazing. It's not until I became 13 when it all changed.

So 13, I didn't Stan a celebrity. I stanned someone I knew in real life - a teacher. He, of course, did not know. It sounds like an 'Uwu teacher crush thing' that everyone gets. I made sure I passed his classroom between lessons (changing my whole route), I'd get nervous when speaking to him. And thats fine, crushes on adult men are fine since it's probably a one off. But mine, it was different.

 I found out his social media, made alternate accounts to catfish him into letting me in his private accounts (luckily, this did not work), think about him non stop (I mean I dreaded weekends because I knew I didn't have his lesson) and I wanted attention from him so bad I'd ACT DEPRESSED around him and once self harmed and tried to get his attention. That's not normal, and I know that's heavily offensive to people who do suffer to depression (I feel sososos guilty for doing that). I was uncontrollable. 

It's not like I wasn't depressed. I wanted to kill myself if he didn't talk to me in a day. Not exaggerating. I was obsessed. My life depended on his attention and recognition.

He left, thankfully. I thought that this was a one off, that it was a sick teacher crush and 'everyone goes through it'. 

But it's starting to happen again, but to another teacher. Im refusing to act depressed around him this time or self harm and I'm trying not to become obsessed. But it physically hurts when I don't look at his Twitter. I can't stop thinking about him. I get nervous around him.

To be honest it's not really a crushy thing. Truthfully what I want is to know everything about them, to be close to them and to tell them everything about how my life is messed up. But nothing flirty or whatever, of course. Like a substitute for the shit parents I have. 

I can't go to a therapist or whatever because my parents will find out. I don't want that happening, that'd be bad. Very bad.

131,"I’m 17 years old female and do have a history of mental illness mainly being anxiety and depression, but also had some sort borderline psychotic episode last summer where I’d see people in my garden (only for a week) and was convinced someone was breaking into my house at night and would physically hear the door opening and people in my house, yet this only lasted for 2 months so I brushed it off. Anyway as of a couple of weeks ago above my should and I weird places where voices wouldn’t be coming from I’d hear chatting and whispering like a background noise on some tv show or like they were at a party and I’ve been hearing voices while drifting off to sleep for ages as well, but recently it’s like I hear external noises but they jump into my head and become louder and I’ve been staying up all night writing out this whole book so summary I don’t know if I’m ok or not and if anyone will read this and help me.

132,"Dunno if this is the right place for this

TL;DR: I'm thinking about getting therapy with my parents. Has anyone ever done this successfully? Is it worth it?

Background: I'm almost 30. My relationship with my mother is essentially broken - she's emotionally abusive, controlling, and manipulative. I know all this, and I still fall for it, every single time. She turns me into a ranting, raving maniac; I say things I regret, and she ends up feeling justified in her initial behavior. My dad is non-confrontational and turns a blind eye to her behavior, while imploring me to be the ""bigger person"" ""for the sake of the family.""

I'm getting to a point in my life where, after my marriage, I will have no reason to ever go home again, except for ""the sake of the family.""

I'm willing to go see a counselor, and I'm financially stable enough that I can swallow the cost. But is it worth it? Does it actually work? Any time I've pointed out her ""bad"" behavior to her, she responds with ""Well yeah, I'm Hitler, so you shouldn't respect me anyways,"" then proceeds to list fifteen things I've done in the past to harm her, starting with the time I was six. Is a counselor going to be any different?

Please help, Reddit.",07Apr2019,1

Apesar disso, eu não consigo pensar em suicídio. Sei lá, ainda tenho esperanças de vencer essas doenças e levar a vida que eu sempre sonhei.

Eu faço terapia toda semana faz pouco mais de um mês. Ainda é cedo pra dizer que me ajudou, mas refletir sobre a minha situação tem me ajudado a ter força. Só me falta coragem e esforço pra vencer as minhas crenças e mudar os meus pensamentos.

Eu queria poder ser a pessoa que ia comentar dizendo que venceu esses dias horríveis e que tem um jeito, que dá pra sair dessa. Eu acho que gostaria de ouvir isso também.

This is where i write stuff to try and understand it more, without telling others. (Its more complex then an 30series long tv show)

3 people in my head:
Samuel-male,leader(by my choice), older then me by about 1 year- unfeeling. Logical. Punishes everyone. Part of Who i am with friends- sign of them, wanting to not feel, a lot of negative stuff

Samantha- female, my age- source of emotion. Wants to do art and music. Shows me love and all good in the world.- sign of them, feel like i should be female. Miss lindsey more. Am more in love and feel happy maybe (idk emotions much)

Sammy-male, young (4-7)- childish. Likes toys like lego. Can be annoying but only in a funny and loving way. - sign of them, talk in a higher pitch/childish way. Wants attention and hugs. Thinks about nostalgic things.

Basic dynamic between them
Samuel wants to hurt sammy 
Samantha stops him
Samuel hurts samantha
Sammy gets upset
Samantha gets really hurt
Samuel takes control of how i feel for a while
I hurt myself
Samuel likes that and begges me to do more
Samantha is trying to calm sammy down
Samuel goes back a bit and sammy then normally takes over for a while.
Then samantha takes back over before i buy lego out of desperation
Samuel quickly gets mad and tries to hurt samantha or sammy (if samantha hasnt taken over again) 
The cycle continues forever. 
I want it to stop. I want nothing in my head
I know when shit has gone bad because i can feel white noise in my head and it slows me down so i know they are having a fight, normally clears with samantha or samuel coming out (mostly Samuel)",07Apr2019,7

142,I’m fairly young but one thing that I’ve come to realize recently is my thought pattern isn’t like the average/normal person.

I know their natures and personalities more than well enough for my mind to always fabricate accurate responses. I only realize what I'm doing and how crazy I must look speaking to the air afterwards.

The period of my life that I knew these people was the absolute best, and right now is the absolute worst. It's like these people are still part of my life, because when it happens it really feels like they're there, and I feel comfortable again.

145,"Hi

So, my best friend at uni (UK) has diagnosed DID. I am best friends with one of the identifed/people, and friends with some of  the others. They are numbered, and so far I have met 6 of them(he's told me there are more than 30). I cannot view them all as 1 person, as they just aren't. They have different religions, different genders, sexuality, speech patterns, vocabulary... They don't all share the same memories either.

The one I am best friends with is the best friendship I've ever had, he looks out for me, he has the same interests as me, we can just sit and talk together for hours and have a great time.

However, the others aren't the same. For the next 4 days I've been told I won't be able to get hold of my best friend, as he's preparing for a weekend trip we're going on. I worry about him though, seriously. They have some other mental health issues, and I'm trying my best to support them. They trust me, but they don't all like me. They won't all reach out for help like my best friend did when he was going to do something really bad. It hurts, and I worry...

They all look the same(and I'm not being racist), but it's disheartening seeing the body of your best friend in a lecture theatre, but they don't care about you. They wouldn't even say hello.

I'm trying my hardest to try to adjust to a completely new way of looking at what a human is, but it's taking a toll on my own personal health (I have epilepsy). I cannot blame my best friend for this though. It is not his fault.

How can I deal with this friendship, without it causing me the significant amount of distress it currently is?

Thanks",07Apr2019,2
147,"Need Help with Dreams and Hallucinations

I have been having more and more frequent dreams which are so realistic that when I wake up, I can't remember if I had a dream or not and anything I thought about merges into my memory.

It's gotten to the point where I thought a few of my friends had died and had a panic attack as soon as I woke up and tried for hours to make sure they were ok or alive. 

It doesn't help that I invariably die in all of my dreams before I wake up, removing any sense of rationality from my thoughts and triggering my anxiety.

Can anybody help with this or at least chat?",07Apr2019,1

I want to know when, I'll be my old self. I'll be able to get a job, I'll be able to travel the worod like my friends, when I'll be able to have a date. To have a life.

I was diagnosed in preschool with PTSD and never received any kind of help other than prescriptions.  I have been vocal since my teens (30F) that the symptoms of this is greatly damaging my abilities to live a normal life. I’m too anxious and ready to run at all times. I always daydream myself working or going to school but the sad truth is I cannot. I do not act right.

I stated in other posts I feel my looks and gender play a part in why I’m never taken seriously. I am hoping to find anyone who has experienced this or seen it. I really don’t think I’m the only PTSD case that gets tossed aside. It would be very comforting, in fact, if I could hear at least one other person tell me I’m not alone with that.

I had a very traumatic childhood that started before I remember. When we were finally safe, I wasn’t. I was targeted by predators. As heinous as that abuse was, I am the most screwed up from watching my mother be beaten to a pulp.
