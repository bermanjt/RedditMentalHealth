0,"I’ve had two kids very close together in the last three years. In that time I noticed a particular close friend and my twin sister (who are also close friends together) never ask how I am, constantly flake on social plans I make, make their own plans without inviting me, ect. After putting up with it for awhile I realised I was setting myself up to feel bad by putting energy into those relationships. So I stopped. And I’ve been putting effort into making friends with other mothers, or just other friends who are genuine friends. For the last few months it’s felt wonderful. I have a new sense of belonging and confidence.

My sister is the problem. Obviously we are family and still have to see each other occasionally. She’s the sort of person who will tell everyone that I don’t talk to her anymore and make me look like the horrible one. I’m really uncomfortable with how to approach this if (or when) she does this in front of people. And I know she will. 

I tried cutting the cord with her last year. She is a very insecure person who brings me down to make herself feel better. She’s very selfish. She never offered help to me when my kids were born and my husband was out of town for work for months, but then turned around and told me I was rude for “not letting her see the kids”.  She told everyone she was so upset because I (unexpectedly) fell pregnant two months before her wedding. She didn’t talk to me for a month because I had to cancel a weekend away wth her to look at wedding dresses because my son came down with tonsillitis. 

Anyhow - we have a family dinner tonight and I haven’t seen her in 3 months. I don’t know how to deal with her behaviour if she tried to create drama. The thing is, I could just downplay it and say “oh sorry I’ve been busy, no I haven’t been avoiding you” just to diffuse it but that’s not true. I can’t lie because it feels fake. I have been avoiding her. “Avoiding” is ignoring her stupid text messages with memes that she sends maybe once a fortnight with no other form of communication.",30Mar2019,7

2,"LI am having brain zap like instances that come out of nowhere it seems. I have been stressed lately and I am a hypochondriac..but this is weird. For 1, I am not epileptic nor do I take ANY pills (so technically, it can't be actual brain zaps).

These arent bursts of adrenaline or a panic attack. I know how those feel, this is different. This is like..just sitting around, bored, and then all the sudden the bridge of my nose feels hot inside...like I am breathing warm air and I get a strange scent 'memory' hit me but I am not actively smelling anything. At the same time my stomach drops like a rollercoaster and I feel my eyes move...then it goes away. The whole experience lasts around half a second (literally, it lasts the length of a blink). I am not sure what this is, but it happened several times today.. is this a seizure? I am scared this is some prodrome to a grand mal. I am worried it is some temporal lobe aura given the stomach feeling and the smell but looking at videos, these all at least last 30 seconds or more. I heard about non-epileptic seizures which are considered due to high stress but those are like tonic clonic seizures. I am just scared........obviously you aren't doctors, and this is no substitute for that but I am merely just hoping someone could relate or explain how this CAN be stress induced and not some weird issue with my brain.

I don't know if I mentioned it above but I don't take any meds, nor have I.",30Mar2019,1
3,"Please forgive the burner account, but I'm sure you understand the reason.

Jumping right in: I am only sexually attracted to women who are petite and have an innocent heart. All of my significant others have all been 5'4"" or shorter, and under 100lbs. I want to find out if this is a legitimate psychological issue or not, and possibly seek help without the risk of destroying my entire career.

A couple things I should clarify:

-I am not attracted to a specific age. I am attracted to a body and attitude type. Many people associate this with an attraction to an age range, and that's not it.

-I am not a sexual offender. I have never sexually encountered, nor have I sought out sexual relations with anyone who's a minor or anyone who hasn't given me their express consent.",30Mar2019,9

Not a very deep conversation, but after chatting with friends, we went over why I hate weekends. Because I wasn’t doing work. Felt kinda useless. Someone else asked what I aimed for in life, and the only response I could muster was “To keep living?”

6,"Back in November of 2017 I had a pretty bad panic attack after I had smoked weed for the first time... I remember feeling like I thought I was going to die but other than that its pretty hard to remember any other details. Eventually 2 months later I began to get tunnel vision which I didn’t realize what that was until a few months ago. I thought I was losing my vision and even went to the eye doctor to find out what was happening and he said everything with my eyesight was fine. The tunnel vision went away in 2 weeks. I felt fine the following 4 months until May 2018 then all of a sudden my memory started to become so bad all at once I could not even remember conversations from the day or what I had for lunch an hour ago. My self esteem also became so terrible and I felt so confused, tired, and emotionally numb. I used to love music and just laughing and having a good time and all of that just went away. I am a girl, 17 years old and I used to actually love life!!! I know that I also experience disassociation when going out in public specifically in stores or large groups of people. It felt a lot like being drunk except I couldn’t control it and it made my emotions become even more numb. Of course I was going to the beach after this happened and I barely have any memories of it. It has been 10 months now and it has gotten a little better compared to when it first happened but I still do not feel like myself and I get very sad from the fact that this feeling that I can’t describe still hasn’t gone away. I know that I am experiencing disassociation and that it’s part of a coping mechanism from the panic attack but is there anything that I actually can do? All I ever do is research it. I have been seeing a therapist but we have only had 2 sessions and I am scared that she won’t know what to do about it.. we have only had basic conversations lately rather than this whole situation. It’s on my mind every single day and I don’t think I have experienced anything having this much of a negative impact on my life. The worst part is that none of my friends understand and I can’t even tell my parents. I don’t want to go out because I know I will just be faking my feelings and be sad afterwards from it. It is so draining and affects me so much. If I am lucky I have somewhat good days but I haven’t felt truly happy since before when I had emotions. Recently I have been falling into a little bit of depression and I am feeling more hopeless than ever and my self esteem has gone to shit. Is there anything that I can do with this because I really don’t think I can bring myself to live with this anymore. Please help me:(",30Mar2019,1
7,"I’ve had depression for around 3 years now, long story short I am now on medication that makes me as apathetic as it gets. I haven’t had thoughts or even felt something (good/bad) for a long time. But tonight I feel like my head is eating at me, I feel so scared and alone and small. It’s been a long time since I’ve felt like this. I’ve relapsed before and I just hope this is not the start of another relapse. ",30Mar2019,1
8,"Someone broke up with me recently and won’t even reply to me.. just broke all contact and stopped responding to me and so my head just thinks.. well if it’s so bad they can’t even respond to you, then obviously I’ve done something or been so awful/terrible that they feel they can’t reply because I’m such a shit person. Same thing with a friend of mine. They told me we needed a break and when I tried to reach out they didn’t reply. 


The only awful thing I’ve done is be a bit angry and spiralled into a really suicidal place. 

Additionally my life is a financial mess. I’m unemployed and had $3 for groceries this morning, and I’m trying to get my life together but the problem is I just don’t feel I’m worth even doing that. Even if I get my shit together nobody cares, nobody is really cheering me on to do that. My ex was the one for that, and now they’re gone. Now there’s this huge space around me and I feel so alone. 

I’m doing a barista course soon to get a job (and I’m really excited for that) and I’m getting stuff together to run a small business and attending all my job provider appts and a personal development workshop and seeing a therapist and taking meds and exercising. 

But it’s like as soon as I start feeling a bit motivated, I’m like but what’s the point, at the end of the day he doesn’t want me in his life and doesn’t even think I’m worth replying to.. I don’t know how to carry on with knowing he will never reach out to me again.. nobody is as close to me as he was.. nobody is wanting that, everyone I know is trying to keep distance from me ",30Mar2019,1

Now it's got to the point she is hurting herself again and I just don't know what to do. 
She just doesn't seem the same anymore, she was once so dedicated to her studies and grades, now she is skipping her lectures. She used to laugh and smile all the time, now she gets annoyed and rants about how people in her life are annoying her.

11,"Making this from a throwaway for obvious reasons.
I'm a normal guy in my 20s, never had any issues with socialising in recent history but was bullied pretty significantly from 3rd to 10h Grade.
Never had a real girlfriend but otherwise no issues with the other gender.
Have a reasonable group of great friends who are actually surprisingly successful in contrast to me.

I have had ticks for as Long as I can think. As a child with severe ADHD I've been called useless and a lost case too many times but still got my highschool degree without any issues.

Whenever I'm nervous I bite my fingernails, pull out hairs from my beard. My bodyhair is probably a little more than what you'd expect of a Guy my age and many comments, though mostly as jokes, have made me feel absolutely disgusted at some parts of my body. I've been pulling hair from the back of my hand for years which led to some kind of inflammation that's been going on for 5+ years now which makes me feel ashamed whenever I Show my Hands but it's Like an addition, I can't stop. 
I also tend to Just randomly pull Hair from my beard and chew my lips to a point where I literally changed the shape of my upper lip.

I Always make weird Shit with my nose even when I don't have a cold which gets even worse when I'm aware of doing it.
Breathing gets hard when I have to attend to some social Events, I get nervious and my stomach goes crazy, sometimes I feel like I'm choking.

I'm currently unemployed after my timed contract expired a few months ago and haven't been able to get Back on Track ever since. Every time I've applied and didn't get an answer or was declined everything got worse to a point where I've basically given up.
I'm just living from day to day, thinking about the next week or the next months/years makes me anxious to a point where I Just want to cry and can hardly breathe.

I tend to almost tear up whenever people ask me about my future or my plans or why I'm wasting my intellect or talents.

I have no reason to get up in the morning and trying to do so makes me feel like I have 200kg of weights on my chest.

I have painful stomach aches and worse after almost every meal, If I'm nervous or going Out it gets even worse.

I've never talked to anybody about this because I feel like I'm Just so lazy and don't want to do anything about it that I Just come up with some kind of mental health issues to get an excuse for my shitty attitude.

The only times I feel good are when I'm lost in games, music, movies or when I'm drunk and with friends.

I sometimes think about what would Happen If I commited suicide. I'd never be able to do it, Not in a thousand years as I still enjoy quite some things in my daily life.
But I sometimes Just stop and think who would be sad, who would and wouldn't care and If people saw it coming or If the Smile i wear when I'm with other people really is good enough to show any of the Shit going on in my head.

I don't even know why I'm making this post or If this sub is the right place but Just writing this makes me realize more and more how messed up my mind is and that I really need to fix some shit before i'll ever be able to live a normal life.

13,"He’s 22 now but I’ve known him almost my entire life. He’s always seemed slow and has absolutely zero social skills. I mean like absolutely none. He keeps his head down, terrible posture, mumbles a lot, doesn’t have many interests. He’s never really had friends until recently. He hangs out with his coworkers and I couldn’t be any fucking happier. 

My family and I weren’t at all educated in the mental health field. This, especially sucks because quite a few of my family members (including myself), are dealing with several different disorders. My family is old school as fuck and originally moved here from another country and have always been somewhat closed minded. 

I was diagnosed with some shit this week. After that, I contacted all the parents of the kids who I believe to have these disorders. If I don’t step in now, not sure if anybody will. I have yet to do my googles but I’d rather ask you guys some questions first since some of you are experienced. 

I spoke with him after I saw a psychiatrist because he’s the first person I thought of that needed help. He believes he’s only got ADD/ADHD because he has trouble focusing on one task at a time. I don’t think he’d believe me if I ever suggested he may be autistic because of the way a lot of people define that word. Also I’m pretty sure he’d feel offended. I’d rather him see and speak with a professional. 

What kind specialists would be best to set him up with?

He’s a good person but I personally don’t feel a connection or anything. Maybe a female therapist would work better but idk.

For instance, today I got pretty upset which led to turning on the shower and spinning in a circle for at least 5 minutes. These movements can manifest in harmful ways (hitting self repeatedly, biting, slapping). I find they are most satisfying/effective if they are rhythmic or some kind of pattern. Other examples are flicking hands at the wrist, repeating numbers or phrases, rubbing, and bouncing.

Suddenly, I felt this pain/pressure in my jaw and my face started tingling on my left side. I started feeling this pressure in my head like something was wrong and my heart started racing. I could feel my legs getting wobbly as I managed to keep myself on my feet because I didn’t want my son freaking out. 

We got home and I took a seat. Trying to catch my breath I could hear the irritability in my voice as I asked my son to get me some water.. I felt he could sense it too and he kissed me on my forehead. :) 

As I practiced my breathing I felt myself calming but my heart was still racing. 5 minutes later and it returned. Heavy breathing and just the feeling of everything being over. I almost called the ambulance but remembered last time how I looked silly and was calm by the time they arrived..

This is my first “attack”. I have been told I have anxiety but I have never experienced such. I thought I was doing better and I refuse to take medicine.

23,"CW: sexual assault, trauma

Hey everyone,
So this weekend I had a pretty terrible experience, don’t know whether or not to call it rape but let’s just say it involved sex and I’m now having extreme trauma responses daily. This isn’t the first time either; I was sexually assaulted at 13 by an ex-boyfriend, which I have PTSD from, and it’s now just doubled down. This is my first year living away from home, in another country, and while my parents were incredibly supportive of my mental health diagnoses in the past, I’m finding it hard to work up the courage to tell them, especially since it won’t be in person. I tell them (almost) everything, and even though it’s only been a week since it happened, I feel like it’s eating me up inside. I just feel like giving up on life, not in a suicidal sense, but in a dropping-out-and-moving-home kinda sense. Has anyone else been in this sort of situation? I just know that they’ll want me to press charges, and be angry at me for getting myself into that situation, and I frankly don’t want to deal with either. I just feel incredibly isolated and alone right now. ",30Mar2019,2
24,"Hello all. So some background- I've had a number of mental health diagnoses over the years. Currently general anxiety, major depression, borderline personality disorder.
However I'm strongly suspecting I may be on the autism spectrum. I've had friends more familiar with the spectrum make the suggestion as well. I also had teachers tell my mother i had signs of autism as a child but my mom took it as an insult and never had me evaluated.
I fit the description of someone very intellectual/book smart who struggles with ""practical"" things such as driving, navigating public transit, keeping organized, etc. While I'm good with people on a surface level i struggle immensely to maintain friendships and trust and misread others too easily.  Also get sensory overload when stressed.
However I'm a fairly attractive young female who is ""good with people"" on a superficial level so I know I'm less likely to be diagnosed. I'm wondering if and how i should bring up the possibility to my therapist.
Self diagnosis is risky but i find it significant that im able to connect issues i have now to problematic childhood behaviors long brushed under the table.",30Mar2019,3

Songs, numbers, time, names of people, karma, would align bizarrely. At first, I was just thankful for the good luck. But it wouldn't stop. I would even think at one point mentally disabled people at the mall were somehow trying to communicate with me symbolically. I had a friend a while back say that we are the universe experiencing itself, but at the time it didn't mean anything. As these things started happen, I started recalling that saying.

Two people talked about wiring (in a power supply and headphones), a helicopter was hovering over the building, and I was covering a shift for someone and didn't really need to be there since activity was low.

So I've recently learned the name of something Ive had all my life in one form or another, (And everyone has in their lives to a small extent, it's normal in small amounts.) Intrusive thoughts. Thoughts that just pop into your head that go against everything your normal thought process stands for. Always wierd, sometimes violent. One of my recent examples was ""what If I drove to the store, bought a crowbar, and ripped up every tile in my house?"" This was an actual thought that I really just couldn't get out of my head, and even though the real me would never do it, the intrusive thoughts sometimes win. I've found myself doing things like chucking things at random walls in my house, dumping glasses of water on the floor at 2:00 AM, etc. for no other reason than that my subconscious told me to. And it's not always just weird things, my thought have run to violence before. I could be out in public walking in the park while I walk past someone, and my subconscious just tells me to punch them in the face as hard as I can. I've had even worse things pop into my head, but I don't want this post to get taken down or something, so I'm leaving them out. I obviously never act on these thoughts, so untill now I've always just writen them off as ""unimportant"". But I'm beginning to think there's really something wrong with me.

33,"First off I apologize for how stupidly long this post is.


My sister is schizophrenic. I found out about this a few years ago, but she was diagnosed when she was in her 20s. I was really young and had no idea. She is 35 years old and has not got her life together. She receives a good amount of disability money from the government and has a part time job at a bank. She is in university, but has failed numerous classes because she does not study and gets distracted easily. She blames the environment because our apartment is small, and we have 5 people (including her) living here. My mom and her partner sleep in the living room so she can have her own bedroom. She is impossible to live with. She complains about everything, she is morbidly obese, she eats constantly, she trashes the kitchen whenever she cooks, she will bang on the door demanding to use the washroom if she needs it and someone is in there. If someone is cooking in the kitchen, she will be extremely nosy and literally (I mean LITERALLY) beg for food, even if she has just ate. She rummages through my room and eats whatever snacks I have in there. If there are leftovers from a restaurant in the fridge, she will happily eat it without asking you, and when you confront her, she will say she didn't do it. 


A few days ago, she was screaming at my mom for soap over and over again. My mom tells her where it is but she is screaming for soap and it is almost 11pm. We are watching a family friend's cat for a week, and she is screaming so much that the cat was visibly frightened and hid somewhere. She barges in my room demanding for soap, I rummage through and manage to find some and I am angry at this point, because she is acting like a baby for a soap bar. I throw it at her, but nowhere near aiming at her face but she ducks wanting it to hit her face, and it hits her mouth. Yes, I shouldn't have thrown the soap in general, but it's like she wanted it to hit her face instead of her arm, which would not hurt her at all. This is where she goes ballistic and becomes extremely aggressive. She calls me a fat pig, ugly, disgusting, threatens to hurt me and damage my belongings, threatens to call the police on me and press charges (this is a reoccurring thing she says to everyone) throws the soap bar at my laptop screen, and at this point my mom and brother are intervening and she begins verbally abusing them. At one point, she says to me ""You tried to stab me"" when I have never done such a thing and I'm so confused.  In fact, my sister in her early 20's pulled a knife on me and my older brother when we were little, and would physically abuse us. She tormented us and my mom and was on all sorts of drugs. Cops at the house were a normal appearance because of her. It's like they knew us. But then she got help, she lived with her best friend for a bit and became a functioning adult, like getting a job and going to school. But she still has these mentally abusing outbursts. 


Sometimes she acts ""normal"", she will buy everyone birthday/christmas gifts every year, she cooks very well without using recipes, she works as a customer service agent at a bank, she is okay with animals, and she will say to me that she wants me and my brother to do good in life or will compliment my hair/makeup, etc. When she is not having an episode, she asks A LOT of questions but it's usually harmless and if you ask her to stop, she'll leave you alone. 


The soap incident happened on Wednesday, and she said sorry to me yesterday but I stayed quiet. She then goes ""I guess you're not sorry"" with an attitude. The cat we are watching is in my room at night, and she knocks on my door demanding to get the cat. I ignore it. She then picks the lock, and gets the cat and then says I scared the cat and I'm on the phone with my boyfriend at this point, and he hears everything she says. She proceeds to call me a mean bitch, fat pig, brings up the fact that I tried stabbing her, and says she will call the police and press charges.


I am so tired of being mentally abused. I don't give a flying fuck that she is schizophrenic. I have tried so many years to separate her and her mental illness because I know she can be kind hearted and she is just suffering. But at this point, she has absolutely no remorse for the pain she causes our family and the PTSD my mom probably has because of her. She picks fights with my mom everyday over the smallest thing. My mom is burnt out. The only reason she lives here is because she pays my mom 700-800 a month for rent. 


She refuses to move out because we live in an expensive city and she wants luxury. I kid you not, she will kill herself before you make her live in a basement apartment or a bachelor. She also doesn't want to move out because she knows she is ""comfortable"" in the sense she can trash the kitchen and my mom will clean it, and my mom pays for groceries, toiletries, etc. She knows she can pull this behaviour on us, because when other people are over like my boyfriend, she ""behaves"" and won't do stuff like bang on the door if someone is in the washroom and she needs it and generally just respect your privacy. 


I have been tormented all my life by my sister. My mind is fucked because sometimes she can be nice, but then she pulls this and I can no longer take it. My mind is in a constant state of confusion. Last weekend, she was trying to cut herself and saying all this stuff about how she wants to die. I was trying so hard to comfort her, but my mom was telling me ""she does this all the time, and ends up verbally abusing me"". 


I am so stressed out that I just want to die. No one can live in peace.  I just want to be feel comfortable in my own home. When I was little, it was like I normalized this behaviour and it didn't phase me as much as it does now. Now that I am older and understand things more, I know this isn't right. I have recurring suicidal thoughts and every time she has an outburst I climb into a darker hole. I can't take this anymore.

34,"I've never been to the hospital about mental health issues ever, besides a suicide attempt many years ago.  I was doing good for a while but depression crept back up in the last month and I've had a lot of trouble dealing with it.  Last night something happened, and I freaked out.  After I smoked I started feeling stomach pains.  This just made me freak the fuck out for a solid hour before I decided I needed help.  I was shaking and hyperventilating for a while.  I've had panic attacks in the past but this was way more intense, like WAY more intense.  I had an insane amount of anxiety.  I tried finding free shuttle services to the hospital with no luck, my RA wasn't home either.  I was running out of options and finally called 911.

The ambulance drivers were very kind, they were mainly trying to help me calm down.  I've never felt so ridiculous in my life, a grown ass man hyperventilating, crying in an ambulance, it was honestly really embarrassing.  I just got completely overwhelmed with emotions, I wasn't even really thinking at this point.  My emotions were making all my decisions, I couldn't think logically.  It was more intense than any moment or any high I've had in my life I really can't describe it.  It didn't even really feel like a panic attack, like I was definitely panicking but this was just so much more intense.  It was just pure emotions controlling me. I've never delt with something like that before.  I still have a hard time remembering everything, it's like my body went on autopilot, I completely lost control.  I'm still having a hard time proccessing this, I've never felt anything like it.  

We got to the hospital and it was just a shitshow after that.  I was still freaking out at this point.  First thing they do is bring me into the main lobby in a wheelchair, crying and damn near delirious to fill out paperwork infront of 30 people.  Then they wheeled me into the waiting room.  I've still recieved no help or coping mechanisms besides what the ambulance drivers told me.  Then they just told me to sit down until a doctor was ready.  

My anxiety was really bad and sitting there shaking breathing heavily infront of the other 20 people in the room didn't help.  I asked multiple times for a private room, even just a closet to calm down in and they said I had to stay out there.  Every time a baby cried or someone started talking near me I just couldn't control my anxiety and emotions.  I was crying, hyperventalating, just generally freaking out and no one did anything or said anything.  I sat there for maybe an hour and it wasn't getting any better.  They eventually gave me a cot, in the middle of the fucking waiting room.  Anxiety was running high at this point and I had to completely throw the blanket over my head/body to get myself together.  I layed under the blanket for maybe an hour, or two until I crashed.

Then they had some lady come over to do my blood work, in the waiting room again.  She told me they were going to do some needles.  I asked here if there's any way to do it without needles (I know it's bloodwork I wasn't really thinking straight).  She got really mad and told me I'd either have to sit here until the doctor got back or do it now.  I told her to do the bloodwork, and she shoved the needle in like half a second after.  I jerked my hand away in shock and this made her even more mad.  She said I tried to stab her with the needle, and just left.  Then I had another nurse asking me why I tried to stab a nurse?? I just jerked my hand back when she put the needle in without warning, clearly there's no malice here.  I told her it was an accident and I'm sorry and she left.  I've had two nurses mad at me now, neither of which seemed to even care about what was going on.  I still haven't seen a doctor and haven't been checked up on once since I got the bed.  

At this point I had been waiting about 3hrs since calling 911 until I could actually see a doctor.  Who did the entire ""examination"" in the waiting room.  He asked me a few questions, had me take an x-ray and that was it.  He told me high THC weed causes panic attacks and I was perfectly fine and could go home.  I waited 3 hours for this man to fill out a short form and that was it.  He didn't any bloodwork, provide any help, coping mechanisms, medication, references, nothing.  He litteraly filled out a half page form, then told me I could go, at 1AM.  So I walked back 6KM to my dorm and that's about it.

I don't know if I should expect more from public healthcare, or if this is how it always is but I'm really dissapointed.  It took me a lot of time and courage to see any healthcare proffesional and this guy didn't help in any way.  I get I could have asked more questions but I was having damn near cripping anxiety and could barely bring myself to talk to the people working there.

When sitting, I turn multiple times to see if someone is watching me. I look at the windows, and I'm sometimes mistaken for some noices that aren't coming from other people.

She just told me that she wanted to die since she was only 10 years old and she always planned to do it before she turned 18. She said she wanted to do it before our little nephew can remember her and that’s one of the things she has to think of when having suicide thoughts. I knew that she was struggling with mental health as she is diagnosed but still had no idea. She said it never got better since childhood and now I feel i cannot
do anything to make it better. She begged me to leave so she can do it but i didn’t. I was able to stop her today but what about all the other days? I cannot be with her every single day since we both live in other cities during the week. I don’t know, I feel like there’s nothing I can do. I just wished she was happy that’s all I want for her and still it seems be too much. Will she never be able to be truly happy? Why is life so unfair?

37,"Sorry if this is too long. 
TLDR is that I have a really weird relationship with sex/physical contact and I don’t know why. 

So I have pretty bad depression and I get really anxious in social situations sometimes where I feel like everyone’s watching me, but those I can mostly handle. The thing that’s really getting to me is I have a really weird relationship with sex, and I always have. Even when I was a kid I remember thinking about doing sexual things with naked women. And I mean really little, like one my earliest memories is sitting in a bathtub and my mom was next to me and I asked her if it was bad to be thinking about naked women because I was and I didn’t know if it was a bad thing (I’m pretty sure she said yes it’s a bad thing). When I was in daycare I got in trouble a couple times for masturbating during nap time. Except it was like pseudo-masturbation, I was just like fondling my crotch through my pants and they’d tell me to stop and that I wasn’t supposed to be doing that. And I started watching porn when I was really young, like 7 or 8 I think. And now I’m really obsessed with sex, and I think about it basically all the time except the weird thing is that I can’t let people touch me at all. Whenever anyone touches me, even friends or family, I get really anxious. Like if a friend were to rest their hand on my shoulder I would be mostly fine, but if they squeezed down at all I’d immediately get the feeling of pins and needles and feel incredibly anxious and shy away or try to get them to take their hand off my shoulder. One time my friend was giving a neck massage to another friend and offered to give one to me, and I accepted, and even though I had a really sore neck I could only stand it for less than 10 seconds before I had to make them stop. And it gets WAY worse if people touch me near my crotch. Whenever someone touches my thigh it sends this bolt of panic through my whole body. I can’t even let my family’s cat walk on my lap because the pressure of the cats foot on my thigh makes me feel super panicked. I don’t know why I’m like this, I don’t remember anything happening to me as a kid or anything but it just seems like I’ve always been like this. I have no fucking clue. Does anyone know why I might be like this or something I can do to try to stop being like this?",30Mar2019,2

39,"Every time I think I'm gaining the confidence to move forwards with my life, with getting help or a job or anything, something always happens to knock me back to square one when it comes to gathering motivation.  


I moved states to stay with my mom, help her in her failing health, and get some help of my own... and then a hurricane left us homeless, but for FEMA providing a hotel for us.  


She had a heart attack. Two, in fact, since the hurricane.  


Every single place we look at has no vacancies or is beyond our income.  


And now, just now, I get an email saying FEMA has been trying to reach us and failing to contact them might get us kicked out of the hotel prematurely. And while I'm panicking and trying to leave a message for them, I knock my laptop a bit and now the audio jack is half screwed. No sound coming out of the right speaker of my earbuds or headset.  


I rely on my laptop for everything. I know it sounds pathetic and petty and first-world-problem-y, but...  It's one of my only working coping mechanisms for my anxiety and depression, one of the only ways I can stay in touch with the people I love, and now it's damaged because I'm a fucking clutz and I'm having a fucking panic attack thinking that I'm gonna just get kicked out onto the street and have no way to stay in contact with my loved ones and the rest of my support network.  


I'm so sick to death of being knocked on my ass. I'm trying SO HARD just to recover my confidence and try being a functioning person, but every time I try it just gets swatted back down. I didn't ask for any of this. I didn't ask to be born with a glitched brain. I didn't ask to be any level of autistic, I didn't ask to be chronically depressed and anxious, I didn't ask to be born and I keep wishing I WASN'T because of this.

40,"I was abused as a kid. I’m not seeking sympathy or pity from this post, I just need to vent and since this account is, for the most part, anonymous, I figure this is the perfect place to do so. As a kid I witness a lot of physical abuse from my dad to my mom, and apparently he would hit me. Idk I must’ve suppressed those memories. But after about 6 long years of my life (my first 6 years alive) my mom finally divorced him. So for a while she would get boyfriends that abused her and break up with them, sometimes having to go to crazy measures to make sure they didn’t fuck with us anymore. I remember some of the abuse but not all of it, my recollection is a bit hazy. I remember, however, that my mom always made sure I had a tv in my room, and anytime she knew something was gonna happen, she would turn on cartoons so that I stayed in my room. I still heard most of what happened, but being a helpless child I couldn’t do anything to get involved, so I would put all of my focus on the cartoon, never telling my mom what I heard, because it would break her heart. Now I can’t watch an old cartoon or I’ll get those deep rooted feelings of anxiety. Growing up around that gave me enough anxiety and depression as is. I fucking hate that my mom and I had to go through that. Because of all of that in the later years, my mom would hit me and lash out at me for seemingly no reason.

At first she started giving me an exercise where I should write down an event that was upsetting to me and what I thought and felt at the time, and then also write down what would make more sense to think and feel. That was nice and all but it has been months and we're still doing that and I feel like we've never moved on to actually *doing* anything. The closest to something to do she gave me was to start planning those things I was avoiding, as if I hadn't tried that before. I feel like we're not getting to the root of the problems at all and if planning is really the only thing that could help then I wouldn't need her for that. She also wrote in my admission letter to my GP that I might have an anxiety disorder and I personally feel like that could be the case, but we haven't discussed the possibility at all. We usually just discuss whatever came up in my life between appointments and I don't see much of an overarching structure or plan to our talks. Is this normal and is this all there is to therapy?

42,"throwaway for obvious reasons, marked as NSFW just to be safe

i've been having really detailed daydreams/dreams involving having my throat slit, being stabbed, attacked, etc. i don't feel afraid at all, i feel excited. relieved, maybe? i think ive started to romanticize violence. i don't know if this is some sort of weird kink, or if i'm at risk of attacking somebody myself because i want to fulfill that image of somebody who could hold his own in a fight, i don't know. sometimes it involves my father, maybe as some sort of coping mechanism since he has been really pushy about church and i'm still closeted, etc, etc, he's been very threatening to me and maybe this is my way of creating a power fantasy where i can get back at him. the idea of being put in a situation where i can get hurt is exciting to me, so maybe i'm just seeking an adrenaline rush. i don't know. i've started obsessing over the idea of being murdered or somebody trying to murder me but fighting back. 

i have no idea where this all stops being just some teenage angst and starts being something that could result in me getting hurt or hurting someone. and i don't even feel really nervous about that idea, i just know, consciously, that it'd be bad. is this just some dumb teenager thing? its so freaking angsty that i'm afraid to talk to people about it bc lol, of course this kid is having murder fantasies, what an edgy teen, wow so scary... i sound so dumb describing this i can't even take myself seriously. 

i just wanted to get this out there and maybe get some advice. here are some things that may or may not be important: 

* i have a bad relationship with my parents because of how religious and nosy they are. i'm gay. they monitor my phone and stuff. bad juju. ive never done anything specific to make them suspicious of me, they just don't want me to watch porn i guess? 
* but i have a good relationship with my friends. i'm not lonely. i'm a little insecure but i'm not too worried, i just trust my friends when they say they like me
* i exercise regularly and eat alright. i'm not physically unhealthy
* i've been depressed before and almost attempted, but i'm in a better place now. i don't really want to die, so idk why i'm fantasizing about being beat within an inch of my life
* i don't have the money (or the relationship with my parents necessary) to see a therapist at the moment anyway, so what do i do in the meantime?
* i've never been tested for any kind of personality disorder or depression/anxiety or anything like that. too nervous to ask my parents. 
* the fantasies are always positive. cathartic almost. like me dreaming about what my life will be like once i move out, away from my parents. like it's better than where i'm at right now.
* sorry if this is tmi but i'm sometimes turned on by violence. the fantasies are never sexual though, which makes me wonder how related they actually are, plus i had these fantasies wayy before i even realized i was into that stuff. so i don't know anything i guess

I could not post this to the ED subreddit, as it is stated in their rules that no triggering information should be made public on that subreddit, thus I am writing on this subject here, because, as far as I know, there is no such a rule on this site.

Some additional details: I am female, sixteen years old and have lived in Russia for my entire life.

I would like to start with the point where it all began. About five years ago my mother and I went to an endocrinologist, as I suddenly started gaining weight  without any visible reasons. I was an extremely impressionable child and the doctor had been warned not to be too direct when telling me about any issues I might have by my mother before we made this fateful visit, however she, the endocrinologist, ignored my mother's advice. When she measured my weight and height, she calculated my BMI and proceeded to mock me for letting myself become ""so disgustingly fat"". My whole world was shattered. 

And, although my BMI was 25.0 (yes, I remember this number to this day), I indeed believed her words and started losing weight. In the beginning it was relatively normal - I cut out a lot of objectively unhealthy foods and started being more active. Be the time I was about 12 it turned into a nightmare. My thirty minute daily workout became gradually increasing its duration and intensity until I had to stop meeting my friends and family after school and spend little to no time on homework. I avoided social events which involved food. I still do.

This was horrible, but not the worst thing in the world. Then my parents started sending me to camps, where I had no opportunities to exercise. I couldn't eat properly for the months during which I was there. My diet consisted of a cucumber, half a tomatoe, a quarter of a pepper and a ton of coffee to keep my heart beating. Do I really need to tell you that I would faint/be about to faint every day?

When I came home, my mother was terrified of how much weight I had lost. I did not know what she was talking about, and I honestly still do not understand her reaction, but seeing this strong woman cry her heart out made me see myself from a different perspective. 

This is where I still am right now: on a treadmill for two to five hours a day, eating nothing throughout the whole day and then eating salad, a yoghurt and crackers before I go to bed. I feel guilty when I think about what my mother is feeling, but I can not stop myself from doing this. I am afraid to tell anyone, so I need your help.

I did what he asked, and booked an appointment with a psychologist... only, for two months later. I’m on the waiting list, apparently.

Even if I weren’t on the waiting list, I don’t think they could help me with my anxiety. I’ve tried helping myself by trying to utilize some anxiety management techniques I read online, only to realize they don’t really work in my case. I don’t drink coffee, I stay away from caffeine, cigarettes, alcohol; tried meditating, and that didn’t work either. As you can see I can’t even help myself.

Also, there's never a grantee that if i hit my exact 8ninwont struggle throughout my day. My brain sometimes hurts not from a headache it's hard to explain. Also, it doesn't matter how much sleep I get I am always tired always. If i sleep for 7, 8, 9 or 10 hours I'm tired. The difference is my mood... The thing is sometimes when I do get the exact amount of sleep I get in a bad mood and hurt other people. Not physically, mentally. I may call them names or insult them. This, in particular, is my fiance. I just don't know what to do... I feel like a certain part of my brain is damaged and the chemicals just aren't working as they should. My world best explained is to imagine you guys who don't sleep for maybe 24 hours or so. You know how you get that foggy brain. In which the world around you feels like a dream? Yup that's pretty much me if I don't in the exact amount of time for sleep. I don't know what to do the last time I talked to a Dr they said anxiety and yeah no it's not just anxiety it feel more like every mental illness known to man is in my head.",30Mar2019,4

55,"hi,

ever since i could remember i’ve always had much more nightmares than normal dreams. as a kid i would often have nightmares about being trapped, falling, or loved ones getting hurt. i always remembered my dreams, and there are lots i wish i could forget. 

as i got older i started to develop OCD with intrusive thoughts. this gradually persisted into some of the worst dreams i could imagine. they became gory, violent, or very traumatizing to recall (i don’t even want to give examples). most of the time they would cause me to wake up or talk in my sleep.

today i am 16 and still deal with intrusive thoughts (they have worsened), my nightmares still as strange and frightening. i have significantly more nightmares than normal dreams. my usual nightmares are about losing loved ones, disasters, or even being pregnant. i still have very outlandish/gruesome nightmares that cause me to wake up or pretty much ruin my day.

one thing to note is that when i dream, in a lot of cases i’m aware i’m dreaming.

how do i stop having nightmares so frequently and that violent? how can i properly recover from an unsettling nightmare?

thank you",30Mar2019,1
56,"I was on prozac before a few years ago, it’s fuzzy if I was on or withdrawing from it exactly I’ll have to ask my doctor, but I went through a period of complete anxiety and sickness to the point I lost 10 pounds. I got prescribed again recently and being dumb, forgot that prozac was the reason I was so sick years ago. I took one pill, around Monday, and the next day the feeling of appetite suppression, increased heart rate, etc was very familiar and I was like oh no. I didn’t take a pill since, completely stopped usage but I still felt like I had days of side effects, couldn’t eat as much, crazy dreams, ect. Now 5 days later I’m having so much anxiety and panic, I can feel dread in my limbs, I know I couldn’t eat anything without throwing it up, woke up way earlier than usual, and doubt I’ll be able to go back to sleep, have been sweating and hot more than usual and even broke out into hives.

60,"I’ve been suffering from depression and anxiety on and off for about 15 years (ever since I said goodbye to the more serious drugs). I’ve never really been medicated, even though I was diagnosed with panic attacks and anxiety in the past.

Recently I’ve come to a realization that some may benefit from, while others may be angered by.

I firmly believe that 90% of depression and anxiety is caused by something in your life that you know you should be taking care of, but aren’t mustering up the effort to handle. It’s your brain and/or souls way of punishing you.

Maybe it’s an unpaid bill.
Maybe it’s a family relationship you know you should mend, but haven’t.
Maybe you didn’t do your taxes in 2008 and you’re still wondering in the back of your head if it’ll ever come back to bite you in the arse.
Maybe you’ve done something wrong and haven’t told anyone, and you subconsciously feel guilty. 
Maybe you have certain habits that you know you need to break, but it’s your lifestyle... or whatever other excuse you come with.

My point... maybe if you just got up every morning, did the things you know you need to do, handled the business you needed to handle, and cherished the relationships you have (including your relationship with yourself)... you just might feel a million times better.

I know for a fact that when I complete a task which I know I’ve been procrastinating, the sense of accomplishment I feel when I’m finished is equal to or greater than any medication out there.

Now, I’m not trying to stand on a pedestal here. I continue to have great difficulty implementing this in my own life each and every day. This message is as much to myself as it is to all of you.

Be in the moment. Handle your business. Enjoy your life. You might surprise yourself.",30Mar2019,3
61,"I usually don’t give money to homeless people(I usually invite them to the homeless shelter or give them food.) but seeing the dog I gave him a ten. He looked at it and put it in his pocket.

I could tell he fed his dog before himself. The dog looked pretty healthy. He started asking me if I worked for the cia and fbi . I said no I work minimum wage at McDonald’s. He started mumbling about stuff I think he said police and god or something. I asked if I could give his dog a treat and he said “ no no I have to give him the food.” ...ok... he started babbling about god and satan in his brain.

62,"I improved myself *a lot* after transitioning from school to college, even though psychologists diagnosed me with moderate to severe depression: Instead of being always late, I'm often the first person that arrives. Instead of forgetting and losing my stuff, I put it in order and plan in advance. Instead of wearing the same clothes for weeks, I have clean clothes, clean teeth, brows plucked, hair brushed. Instead of oversleeping, I wake up at 5 am. Sometimes every fiber of my body wants to die, I want to scream, but I focus and refocus stubbornly on the lecture or assignment. Sometimes I can feel my heart beating like a maniac and I can't breathe properly, but I can force myself to keep talking. I'm still not really *functioning*. I want to wake up at 5 am and start working on my projects instead of crying until 10 am. I'm convinced that if I try harder I can improve that. I can change things for better on the outside, but nothing is really changing for the better inside. In fact, I feel pretty hopeless and on the edge all the time, and I thought I would break, but I didn't.

So besides how much will power I can actually cultivate, is there a risk if I push myself further? Like pulling myself together after a small breakdown and just continue working? Like, can you have burnout when you already have anxiety and depression?",30Mar2019,1

64,"I (20m) finally saw a psychiatrist a few days ago after procrastinating it for 6 months. A little backstory.. my therapist recommended this psychiatrist because she knows him personally, and I’ve been seeing her for a year now and I absolutely trust and confide in her. After 6 months of just us talking, she mentioned getting diagnosed. I didn’t decline it but I was definitely hesitant. I’m not sure why. We still try to get to the bottom of it. For starters, it took me years to get into therapy, I would always cancel my first appointments at the last minute. So now that I was finally regularly seeing a therapist, yeah seeing a psychiatrist is like just another step and it took me 6 months to do it. So I’m finally there, the doctor had his service dog so that was very pleasant. I was really anxious. He diagnosed me with bipolar 2 which is what my therapist also thought. He prescribed me a medication and we set up a follow up appointment in 4 weeks to see if I want to increase the meds or not. I was supposed to fill my prescription that same day so I can get started ASAP, it’s not been a week and I haven’t gone to the pharmacy. Something is just stopping me, my mind. I’ve felt like shit after the appointment too. Not like “oh my god I’m actually bipolar I’m a piece of shit” its just I feel OFF. I don’t feel well or light. I feel heavy and my mind is spinning. I also feel kinda dull. I don’t want to get on the meds feeling this way and I’m hesitant with taking them just like I was with seeing a therapist and psychiatrist. I don’t know, has anyone felt rather off after being diagnosed? It’s so annoying feeling this way, I just want to finally feel okay. 

TLDR: I’ve always been hesitant with getting help. Finally got diagnosed and feel awful after. Haven’t filled my prescription yet. ",30Mar2019,14

I made the connections with people I went for dinner I got out of my head for the first time in a long time... I still have a long journey ahead of me... I'm going to see a therapist even tho is costing me 250 an hour but baby steps... Maybe she will see that I'm getting better in the end maybe not but the one thing I will say is that do it for you. Don't cater to anyone else don't let someone else dictate how you should live your life.. you are in the driver seat so own it... It doesn't make you weak for asking for help.

72,"I need to tell my story, would you care to listen.....

So I'm in a depressed mental spiral. I'm a ""JR""  as well as the oldest of 5 kids, and growing up I was constantly told that I was just like my father in so many ways. From my looks, behaviors, mannerisms, and even joining the USMC. My father used to be my hero and idol growing up until I was 7 yrs old. That's when I noticed alot of shit, he would physically discipline me and my brother (2yrs younger) and it would be harsher when he was upset about other things. I think my mom could tell a lil bit and over the following years they went thru a divorce. But during that time he was more aggressive as time went on. 

After he left, he tried to preserve his image of a good father and fought for visitation. At this time I was around 10yrs old and he started dating again as well. His GF was a kind and loving woman who I befriended. They had two kids, first was my sister and then a 2nd brother, but after my brother was born my father suddenly disappeared and went all radio silent as I was about to begin HS and my teenage years. Fast forward to after graduation and just a few months before I left for Boot camp for the U.S. Marine Corps (18yrs old) and I get a msg via Facebook from his GF. She says that they wanted me to visit and be apart of their lives. So I decided sure, and when I found out not only did he remarry his GF, (wasn't invited to wedding) but I had a 2nd Sister as well and nobody mentioned it. Later on I made him promise to never put my siblings thru the pain that myself and my brother went through. He agreed, fast forward 10yrs and not only did he divorce again after cheating and break his promises, but he also convinced himself that he never made any promise and that I didn't know the full story. Yet he posts about his latest GF and praises her kids while ignoring his own. 

And then brings us to present day as I  my oldest lil sister (18yrs old) wanted to spend her spring break by my apartment just to relax and reforge our bonds that we had before i was absent for my teenage years in her life. We were extremely close and wanted that bond back. As we talked and talked, my sis told me that our father had not only groped her under her pants but had her do the same to him right before I came back into her life. I was so disturbed by this because I would kill for my siblings, especially my sisters if someone hurt them. 

But what disturbs me the most is that when she told me, there was a part of me that wasn't surprised. Reason is that before my parents divorced, I had heard whispers that my aunts (father's side)  were sexually assaulted my my father, but my grandmother didn't believed them because she could never see any wrong in my father. She was also the type who would openly say/show that I was her favorite grandchild because I was the 1st born and named Jr. 

My sister confided in me because I too was the victim of a sexual assault (from a woman) and knew i would understand her in some way. But knowing this know has triggered so much confusion as I am haunted but past voices who had always said ""You're just like your father."" 

I don't know if anyone out here has any similar experience but any advice would be helpful as I have been overwhelmed by negative emotions and intrusive voices while I wonder who/what I am. For a name is a powerful thing, but in my case it feels like a shackle that is cancerous to me.  (I live in Chicago IL, USA)


P.S. yes I have intrusive and suicidal thoughts but I have too many things that have been preventing me from going thru with it (Thank God), so please be at ease regarding that situation. ",30Mar2019,203

74,"For the past year I've been working at my management-level job. Being organized and a good planner, managing employees and orders and whatnot is something I excel in. When I got the job with no prior experïence or any kind of education, I was ecstatic. I felt like the world finally sees my potential and I've found my place in it. I made good results from the start, got along with my employees and coworkers wonderfully and came up with little practices to make all of our days easier. Everyone loved me and I got good feedback from everyone and got such a confidence boost from my job. Before this job I used to do multiple short term jobs a year and I've dropped out from three different schools so finding something that was long term and that I enjoyed and good at was great.

Then after a few months it started to go terribly. One employee quit and the company refused to hire anyone to replace them. I got a bunch of new clients so a lot more work for my team and they still refused to hire anyone new. Now that that's been going on for months, we're all exhausted and cranky. Every day at least one person is on a sick leave so there's even less of us working now. We get every order ready late and understandably the clients are getting cranky too. I'm the first one in the line of contact for my employees, my bosses and my clients so all of their complaints go through me and every day I get to hear from someone how I'm doing a bad job. I try to believe that I'm doing the best I can with what I have to work with but thinking like that is getting difficult. I work overtime every day and I work so hard and try to pay attention to everything and everyone but it's not enough. And I on the other hand just have to suck all my complaints up. I can't tell my employees to work any harder since I know the situation is unfair already and they're all doing their best. They're working so hard that their mental health is suffering so they have to take sick days. I can't tell the clients to stop complaining since there's a contract we're not honoring by getting each and every order done late. I try to talk about the situation with my bosses and they tell me that every other manager is in a similar situation and they're doing just fine and it's normal that the clients get cranky sometimes and it's my job to keep them happy. They pretty much just tell me to suck it up and to trust that this situation is temporary. This has been going on for months and I only see it getting worse. 

I feel like this job is breaking me and I don't know if this is normal for a job or am I just complaining and stressing out for nothing. I feel like my anxiety is getting out of hand and me secretly crying in a bathroom is a daily thing at my job now. I'm so anxious and stressed out that I find it hard to concentrate on the smallest things when I constantly worry that I've forgotten something or I'm going to mess up since we're on a such tight schedule that there's no room for error or time to start over. I misunderstand everything, forget to do things and can't remember having conversations people refer to afterwards. To be honest, I don't know if they're trying to gaslight me to get out of responsibility or if I'm actually such a mess right now that I've just forgotten entire conversations. I feel like the latter is impossible since I try to write everything up so that I wouldn't forget but I don't trust myself anymore.

I'm a perfectionist so not having the resources to do my job perfectly is hard on me and I do realize that that is a personality thing and it's something I'm trying to work on. I'm also trying to concentrate on other areas in my life than my job and get the feelings of success from somewhere else. It's just hard when the job is so draining that it's difficult to find the energy to exercise or to see people when all I want to do is sleep when I get home. My relationships are suffering because of this since I have to always put my job first and the little energy I have left to care about things goes straight to my job. I don't even know what's going on with most of my friends anymore.

I guess I just wanted to get feedback on if this is normal. Does everyone get this sad and exhausted because of their jobs and am I just being a baby about it? Do I have unrealistic expectations? Am I not thinking or seeing something that would help me? Should I quit my job? ",30Mar2019,1
75,"I am 26M. I've had social problems since I was a little kid, and I haven't ever had any close friends I felt I could share anything with.

I've tried dating both men and women in the past. I end up feeling bored with the person very quick, and being out with them makes me feel lonely and out of touch. I have to act super fake to get people to like me, and then I barely get anything out of it. When I act natural, I have the urge to say a bunch of insane shit for laughs, and I don't act my age.

I feel like I'm deeper than most people and have stronger emotions. I can immediately tell when people are bored, frustrated, or whatnot, and it's like I also feel it myself. But this sense just makes me anxious that people are also picking up on my facade and immaturity. Actually, with the amount I've been rejected, I know for a fact that they are.

I tend to have a lot of different interests, but they're fleeting. Most people I meet like a specific game for example and then stick with that for years. I get deeply into something for like two weeks and then I get bored when there's nothing else to learn about it. I tried to get into things like football and sitcoms to have things to talk about, but I just get bored and tune them out.

Some of the things I'm into just don't seem to mesh with who I am at all, and I would never want anyone to know what I care about. As a kid, I would check out books about things like pronounciation and African American issues (despite being a white guy), and my parents and others would be like, ""Wtf, why are you reading that?!"" 

I have delusions of grandeur thinking I could create a bunch of shit, but I don't even know where to start. Like I was to make a game with no knowledge of computer programming, and it's extremely detailed on my mind. I've written songs despite playing no instruments.

I just don't know what's up with me or how to fix it. I would like to have friends I don't feel the need to play pretend around all the time. 

I don't think it's autism for a variety of reasons, but I've still tried to fit in with the autism community anyway. And I just don't. I find autistic people more interesting in some ways and more frustrating in others.

76,"So I work for a small Protection Agency that takes extremely varied and unique contracts even on same day notice.  They only hired very experienced people.  In the past 6 months I've been part of a 6 man team protecting our state's new Governor, 3 different frat parties, a fancy hotel, varies stores and clinics ect, nearly always in plain clothes.  We are expected to just show up and figure it out based on experience.  As luck would have it my boss had someone quit with no notice (extremely rare here) and he needed someone to work a lot of hours at Women's Shelter.

Here's where the mental health part comes in: after 5pm on any given day all the case managers, councilors and other trained staff go home.  After that until 7am I am the only person in facility with 25 residents who nearly all have moderately heavy mental conditions as well as chemical dependancy issues and domestic abuse trama.
I wish each and every one of them the best but they sure know how to push my buttons.  

True events on duty:

-- Woman throws an entire pot of hot coffee on another resident.

--Residents pass out drunk on the floor of the common areas

--Resident screams at the top of her lungs for hours in a voice that is not her own and honestly would fit in an exorcism movie.

--Resident walks around all day saying the most vile things to no one at all but if you tell her no the monologue switches to subjective pronouns refering to someone being sent to hell ect.

--Residents ask for me (and others from our team) to unlock certain areas after hours to look for some supply and then move to the back corner of the room and forget  to have there pants all the way up.  This is the most  disturbing part as I would never touch any of them except to do first aid but it could lead to false accusations.

I'm not expected to do any counciling but the residents forget that and tell be disturbing stories from their abuse that are a bit much to handle with everything else I have on my plate.

Any advice on how to better manage this situation alone will be greatly appreciated!

77," 

So I wanna start off by saying that my childhood wasn't exactly normal, if you will. My mom left when I was a baby and i stopped being able to see her when i was 4, I'm 20 and i've seen her one time since then. My dad married someone else and i enjoyed her company but then my sister was born a bit after i wasn't able to see my mom anymore and i was diagnosed with ADHD around then. About a year later I started to torture and kill animals for fun and it made me feel really good and powerful. The joy it brought me was unparalleled. I kept this hidden from my family and friends until a few days ago. I tortured/killed small animals until i was about 15 and got bored of it and ran out of excuses for what i was doing in the woods. I lie a lot. I don't even realize I'm doing it most times. I've gotten really really good at it and use it to manipulate people mostly.

My dad went through a precription drug addiction for a few years around when i was 9 and that just added to my emotional distress. I've never been able to feel remorse for my actions and still can't seem to muster up any. I'm able to feel what i would consider love but only for a few people and social interactions are horrible for me. I hate them. I can experience cognitive empathy where as i can put myself in someone's shoe's and understand why they feel the way they do but i can't feel the emotions they feel. If a person is sad, I'm not gonna also be sad because it isn't my problem.. I've seen people I would say that i loved and was close to die right in front of my eyes (natural causes) and felt absolutely and undeniably nothing. Sometimes there's a voice in my head that tells me that people i pass by on the street deserve to die and that i should be the one that makes it so.

78,"I visited my mom for the first time in a minute (we weren't getting along in January, and in February she refused to apologize). I spent 3 hours with her in her new house (so unfamiliar playing field), and really felt like I realized some things about her. Number one was that my mom has always been afraid of becoming her mom (a narcissistic alcoholic and drug abuser), but that's exactly who she is. Number two is that she feels little to no remorse for how she treated me, and that really hit me like a ton of bricks. When I was about 14, my father had a stroke after they tried to  remove a tumor from his pituitary gland, and I realized I could be left with my mom as the only parent. My mom has always been tempramental, prone to fly off the handle, call names, etc. and I thought there was only one way out of that. I called suicide hotline after self harming a while, kind of dilly-dallying between getting on with it or not. And when my mom came to the hospital, she loudly announced ""Great, another bill I have to pay."" and that scarred me for life. just this week we really spoke about it, and she told me that's how she felt and continues to feel about it, because I didn't consider how she felt dealing with both my father and me at that time. I was genuinely shocked that a mother could feel that way about her child, as I had always suspected my mom didn't care about me in a normal way. But it keeps buzzing around my head for the last few days. How do I get past it? I know she won't change. But I'm hurting deeply. 

TL;DR: i attempted suicide at 14 and my mom felt I inconvenienced her by doing so, and I need help healing/moving on.",30Mar2019,1
79,"She is self diagnosed with schizophrenia. I thought she actually been diagnosed but found she did it herself from a semester of psychology in college.. 

Anyways she hasn't been sleeping, she says she does but I wake up and she is awake and i see she post facebook stuff all night so if she is then it is very short burst. She sees dead people, she thinks she has both telepathic and telekinetic abilities, thinks the cops are aliens, thinks I hired people to follow her, thinks I may poison her food and tells me she hopes I did, tried to hang herself in front of me with an extension cord by shutting it in a door but pretty sure she did it for attention. She tells me sometimes she walks around with a knife in the kitchen wanting to kill people but doesn't. She tells me she doesn't want to go to the hospital because schizophrenia powers are real and medicine is to take them away because the government doesn't want her to have it. Thinks my neighbors are spying on her, the government put them in the apartments next to us to spy on her.

Her family is no help, they are pretty much dirt bags. I talked to her dad and he told me to just leave her alone and she will get better and not to provoke her. It's hard not to though because she sits there and rambles about hearing my thoughts and accuses me of murdering people or sleeping with other girls while I'm at work. Told me her FBI friend has been following up on me so she knows what I do.

Anyways Saturday she told me that she was thinking of checking herself in, I was like I'm proud of you. Asked her when she wanted to do it and she said she didn't know but wanted to put all her stuff in storage first so I didn't steal it or have new girls over to steal it. Then Monday came and I was like this is the best day to go and she said she didn't want to anymore. 
These spurts come and go but it's not good for my mental health because I have BPD and depression and usually I don't need my anxiety medicine but been taking the max for the past two weeks. I've attempted to kick her out twice in the past week, once on Thursday when I was like you need to put your stuff in storage and check in or leave. The other was last night because she was breaking stuff. Both times she had her stuff packed but said she was just going to jump in the river and said she asked friends but no one will let her stay. So she has no where to go... I could deal with this more if she was trying to get help but she isn't at all. This has been going on off and on since September/October but the whole killing herself just started recently. Before she said she wouldn't do it because she loves her nephew too much but he got taken away by CPS because her sister is a meth addict who got arrested. 

Her dad is not on board with committing her and her mom sucks and enables her by agreeing that she has telepathy and special power so I have no idea wtf is up with that. Neither will let her stay with them though because she has gotten violent with her dad and her mom lives with someone else and only has a bedroom.

I don't know who to contact because if I try and it doesn't work I'm afraid she will leave and kill herself somewhere else and there won't be anything I can do to stop it. I called the non emergency number twice for the police last night when I went to walk my dog over her crazy actions which I recorded her crazy ramblings with my iphone but I hung up before they answered after being on hold awhile. If they did come out and did nothing for her then I'm pretty sure she'd kill herself.

She has slit her own throat in the past and has scars from it. 
I'm in Evansville, IN. I don't know if I should just like maybe call the mental health place Monday and see what they say. What sucks is I have been to a couple, the one she said she would check herself into is a good one. I'm not sure where she would go, one is the state hospital and it is pretty much like jail and I came out more depressed than when I came in.",30Mar2019,1
80,"I've been having panic attacks for a few months now, and I'm finally getting to my Dr appt date on Tuesday so I can get it better handled. Anyway, in the mean time, I have some Xanax leftover from a past dental appointment, and I've found that while I'm having my panic attacks, it's hard to take them. A lot of my panic is based around my heart and pulse (It's always something stupid, I can't even wear my Fitbit anymore because seeing my pulse number is a trigger no matter what it is) and one of the things my brain  convinces me of is that somehow I will react badly to this medication I've taken before and I will get TOO CALM and my heart will suddenly stop. Which of course makes my panic worse. Yesterday while in public I got a panic attack about as bad as the one that hospitalized me when this issue first started. I finally convinced myself that if the Xanax killed me, the heart attack I was clearly having was going to do it anyway. So I took one. Shockingly, not only did I not die, but it worked so quickly that by the time we got back home I was laughing about how dumb the whole situation seemed. Now that it's the next morning, I'm just pissed that my brain had that much self preservation for this panic attack that it has been convincing me that the only thing that will help stop it will actually hurt me. Has anyone experienced this before? Does anyone know how to overcome this irrational fear so I can help myself when I really need it? Thank you all.",30Mar2019,2

82,"My mom is sick. As long as I can remember she hasn’t been right, she was just different, even when I was little. Always said things to me like she loves me so much and that if it wasn’t for me, she’d kill herself. She tells me what a horrible monster my father is (he’s not). Then she’ll hate me the next day. She’s unbalanced. I’ve always taken care of her ever since I was a kid. Eventually she got Lupus too. Maybe. She could just have munchausen. She really enjoys sitting in bed all day popping pills and having me wait on her. I took care of my sister a lot too even tho she was older. (She’s a little mentally unbalanced) My dad wasn’t around much. He kinda yelled a lot when I was a kid, was def emotionally abusive, but he’s gotten so much better since. He worked really hard to change when he realized how broken I was. I know he loves me.

I was always a high achiever in school and in life. I think it was a fake it till you make it kind of thing cause I worked myself into the ground in an industry that had a highly toxic work atmosphere that I became very normalized to. I’ve always thought that you had to keep everything inside and be strong and successful and take care of others. Eventually I had a mental break.

It’s been about a year and a half since then and I got myself into therapy finally. LOTS of therapy. I’ve been diagnosed by different drs with various mental/mood disorders. Borderline, autism spectrum, OCD, imposter syndrome, depression, anxiety, etc. I don’t really care what I have. I’m just focusing on getting better and not hurting myself thru a combo of meds and therapy.

While I know I have my issues and that environment played a big part in the way I turned out, I can’t discount genetics. I’m terrified of turning into my mother. I have severe social anxiety, won’t leave the house except for work anymore. I don’t know how to talk to people or be myself. I don’t know if I’ve ever felt connected to another person. Don’t do social media at all and this is my first time on Reddit this past week and it’s been amazing. For the first time in my life I feel completely free. That’s pathetic, I know. I’m just so afraid all the time. How do I not be afraid in the real world? How do I learn to talk like this and be me in person and explain to people that there’s nothing wrong with me, I’m just different? Especially with people who have known me for a long time. Because they always notice or have known that I’m different and I don’t know how to explain what’s wrong with me.",30Mar2019,2

89,"I have an older brother, and I seem to be a disappointment to him. Now, I am a very sensitive person, and he doesn’t have much experience with mental health issues, obviously. It’s a very bad combination, and when I fall behind, he leaves me behind. Any secret that I have, he would have no problem mentioning casually in a conversation.  When I lock my door, like to dance, or do anything “normal” for my age and gender, he makes me feel bad about it, with words like “of course you’d like rhat”.  He wants me to be like him, it seems, but I let him know clearly that I can’t be a mini him. Now I’ve been hanging out with him less, and he’s sort of given up on me, idk I enjoy every minute of the time we hang out. When I post on r/menralhealth, talk to someone who can help, or speak about how I feel, he invaded my privacy just to judge me and make fun of me. Anything “edgy”, “depressing”, or “dark”, he’d suggest it to me. I’m a happy person. I like to laugh, play, dance, give and get, but now, I guess I’m not. I am being held against all these labels and stereotypes, and it’s not just him.  I am a lot like my brother already, but not in ways that he would appreciate. A lot of them are bad ways, and ways that would make us less likely to get along. Now, I know I shouldn’t have done this, but sometime a while ago, I went through his messages with a mutual close friend of ours. I saw he said one time, “let’s watch without her, Kathleen is shit”, “everyone in my family just has problems, I thought Kathleen would be good, but she isn’t”. This further supported my “I’m a disappointment” and at the time I saw rhat, I was going through a lot. I know he’s a little worried, he prob doesn’t know how to handle it, and neither do I. His expectations for others are so warped, and I feel like he has a hard time accepting that I am bad too. The fact he can’t accept me is prob one of the reasons we have issues. To be honest, I think he has some issues too. He is very quick to get very down on himself, and sometimes doesn’t seem to have too much motivation.

94,"Super long, no one should read this, just in a weird mental state and all I can do is type this out. I want to give a trigger warning but I don’t know what for, I just know that some of
this might be triggering to some. Some mention of self harm. Reading back over it, I’m not really sure if any of this is coherent or not. I think it might be, but forgive me if I don’t make sense. 

Background: 18 y/o cis female. Midwest US if that means anything. Lots of stuff going on, I haven’t been to a doctor about any of it yet and honestly don’t plan to. Have had mental health problems since middle school (depression, anxiety, at one point I had IED. Also, almost positive I had OCD back then but I was never diagnosed for it) but this is the worst I’ve ever been. 

I reached my breaking point last night. Deleted all my Instagram posts, stop responding to friends, realized my life is Bruh Sound Effect #2. 

I’ve been feeling super depressed recently. I go through periods of literally losing what I’d call my humanity, where I’m not suicidal, I’m not gonna kill myself, but I literally have no will to live or do anything (not even a will to get better) and don’t see my life going anywhere else. I’m going through one of those now and I don’t know if I’ll ever get out of it this time. I can’t really describe it well, but there’s this feeling that I know I used to have and I think normal people have too, and it’s kind of the thing that keeps you going. Like, you’re living to live and you feel like your life will proceed. And I’ve lost that.

I’m a senior in high school, home stretch now, and this has seriously impacted my ability to work. I tried talking to the mental health councilor or whatever but she can’t help me either. She just tells me that I gotta motivate myself do my work, but the thing is, I CAN’T do my work. No matter how much I want to, no matter how much I try, I literally just can’t pick up that pencil and write my goddamn homework. If I try reading the textbook, I can focus on a sentence for maybe a total of five seconds before I’m done. Nothing I read makes sense. I’m failing literally all of my classes. Literally every single one. I’ve always been one of those “untapped potential” students, 2.7 with a 35, but like, it’s gotten to a point where I deadass don’t know if I’ll graduate. Even if I manage to graduate, I think my college will take back my acceptance if I get all Fs this semester, and unlike some people I can’t buy my way in, like I’m pretty sure my family is below the poverty line or some shit but that’s a whole other story. I’m scared for my future and if I could just fucking DO my goddamn HOMEWORK. 

I’ve temporarily cut off contact from a lot of friends because they try to give me advice and comfort and it pisses me off so goddamn much. I know that in my more sane state I’d truly appreciate them trying to help and would probably realize I’m in the wrong, but none of their well-meaning advice helps because they don’t GET it and it makes me ANGRY. They’re so annoying and they don’t know it. I don’t know. I might be more pissed in general. One of my best friends is pretty damn republican and conservative (no diss to republicans, y’all can be great, but I am definitely not one of them) and a lot of the shit they say makes me so mad, like, stuff about abortion and trans people and stuff like that. I don’t know if it’s me realizing that they’ve secretly been an asshole this entire time or me just, again, being pissed at everything, and THAT’S making me even more frustrated, I don’t know if I’m hating my friend for no reason. I’ve been scratching myself (not enough to draw blood or anything) because I need a release from my frustration and I don’t want to punch my wall or anything. Even cut myself a little twice but I don’t think I’ll make a habit of it. 

I’ve also kind of lost the ability to distinguish what my tone is when speaking and mine and other people’s intentions, and whether or not I’m like, making any sense when I talk. 

Also, some stuff is going on with my body? 

I’ve been growing more facial hair. Probably not enough for someone to really notice, but if I look in a mirror I personally can definitely tell. 

I haven’t had a period in three months now, almost to the date. It used to be really irregular a few years ago but it more or less evened out in these past two years. My cycles fluctuated between like 25 and 40 days, but like, I’d usually get it within a week of when my tracker was telling me. There’s no chance I’m pregnant or anything, since I’m a gamer, so that’s not it, but I don’t know what it is. 

In hindsight, these both could be caused by stress or whatever. Despite knowing these may or may not be signs of a medical problem, they’re welcome changes and I like them. The facial hair makes me feel better and the lack of periods is obviously a relief. I’ve also been, sometimes, sweating more that usual, and that’s actually pretty nice too, makes me feel manlier. As I said, I’m a female, and I’ve always identified as such, but I’ve been feeling more and more masculine. I’ve never been dysphoric or anything, and I’m certainly not claiming to be transgender, but like, I’ve been having some confusion about my body. For the past week or so, whenever I look in the mirror, I’m shocked. Like “oh, THAT’S what I look like?” I always think I’m supposed to look more masculine and just, different, than I actually do. Skinnier, darker hair, etc. It’s not that I hate the way I look, but it makes me uncomfortable and always gives me a shock when I look in the mirror because that’s not what I’m SUPPOSED to look like. Like, yeah, I’m pretty ugly, but I don’t feel uncomfortable because of that, it’s because I just,, it’s not what I THINK I look like, goddamnit. There’s no image  in my brain that I “think” I look like, I just know that I’m not supposed to look the way I do. Again, I don’t hate the way I look. I’ve never been conventionally attractive and I’m fine with that. Idk. Is this body dysmorphia?? I don’t know.

Yeah, I think that’s about it. Surely it’s not, but it’s all I can think of right now. 

So what the FUCK is wrong with my mind and what do I do?

TL;DR:

-I’ve lost literally all emotion except frustration 
-No will to do anything
-Don’t see a point to life and can’t imagine me living past the current moment 
-Can’t bring myself to do schoolwork, failing all my classes 
-Havent had period in 3 months 
-Don’t see myself as what I really look like ",30Mar2019,1

Instead it's something simple like ""ok you're depressed"". Well no shit Mr/Mrs professional, I didn't need you to tell me that.

96,"I saw a new psychiatrist today after waiting a while to see him. After being assessed and everything, he decided that Zoloft was the best medicine for me to go on. I’m not going to lie, I was disappointed.

I’ve been on and off medication since I was 14. Diagnosed with bipolar and borderline personality disorder at 14 and I’ve been on allllll of the medication. I have already been on the standard SSRI’s including Zoloft and Prozac, Paxil, etc. Zoloft was one of the medications I was on when I first attempted suicide at 18. I told him this.

I’ve come a long, long way since 18. I’ve mellowed out a lot and don’t have the extreme highs and lows as I once did. I’ve been unmedicated for a long time. I’ve been on trokendi (extended release topamax) since August, but it’s more of a migraine medication. The psych hospital gave it to me because I’ve tried so many meds, they didn’t know what else to give me and it’s an off label bipolar med, even though there’s no research that says it works for bipolar. I have severe panic disorder and anxiety. That is why I’m seeing the psychiatrist. Anxiety and my panic attacks are taking over my life. With my health issues (I have POTS, fibromyalgia, Hashimoto’s, migraines, etc), I catastrophize things and truly think I’m dying about 10-12 times a week. It’s incredibly exhausting. The amount of times I’ve called 911, gone to the ER, or have had my husband come home is insane. My health issues are real, but the symptoms go as fast as they come and I freak out at new symptoms and think I’m dying. It’s terrible.

Does anyone have any experiences with Zoloft? He says let’s just try it out again because things I’m older now and have mentally come a long way, but I’m scared. My circumstances and situation are obviously way different too. I was sure he would also give me emergency medication as needed like Ativan or something but he didn’t. I was hoping he would because I’m sick of going to the ER. I don’t want to ask for it because I don’t want to seem drug seeking, and I’ve never asked for medicine before in my life, but I really feel it would be beneficial in my case just for a short amount of time. I went off my klonopins two months ago because they weren’t as fast acting for me for emergencies and I don’t like taking meds just to take them for fun.

101,"Sometimes it’s like I have two sets of emotions, usually separated on their own but sometimes converging which is odd since they are contradictory.

One part of me does seems to care for people, I enjoy helping people, donating to charities, etc. and I’m quite submissive and I hate to be a bother / harm people 

On the other hand, at times, I’m much more sadistic and have very gruesome
fantasies (not to be confused by my wording; the fantasies are usually not sexual) when I feel like this I often wonder how it would feel to cut/stab someone etc. How would I feel? I think I would feel pleasure from it? What would it be like to be a serial killer? Exhilarating, right? And during this I feel hardly anything for people, who cares if they die or get hurt?

These two sets of feelings are separate/standalone half the time. However, It’s quite odd when they converge, which does happen more often than I’d like it to. It becomes contradictory.

How? Why? I cannot wrap my mind around how it’s possible to be willing to give up your life to save someone at any any time but also not care about them and want to harm them?

At the very least, I’m never completely one or the other. One side of me will seep into the other. Which I think is good, it keeps be from hurting people, I would feel bad if I were to hurt someone.... but I feel that way while at the same time also getting pleasure from thinking of causing people harm? Anyways, the good keeps the bad in check so I don’t think I would ever act on anything.

I don’t think any of this is noticeable from an outside perspective though. I act the same on the outside no matter how I feel on the inside 

Ah just to mention, these sets of emotions switch somewhat unexpectedly, sometimes every other day and sometimes several several times in a day

102,"Ok, time to do this. So one of the beloved buttheads thinks I have a book in me. Specifically with the whole selfie thing I do. But photography has never been my sole intention with it. It's always been about exploring both my relationship to myself and my relationship to mental illness.  So I moved the whole project to a blog so I have a little more space and freedom to work with the idea.  If you have a few minutes, I would appreciate you looking and reading and letting me know what you think. I struggle with the ideas that 1) someone wants to hear what I have to say and 2) that my intent is being communicated. Does it have impact?

Obviously the reblog featuring the Disney disco album and the dog pic are unrelated to the total project.

103,"I have no idea if this is a mental health thing or what but about 8 years ago when I was year 7 I started to get these feelings like everything was a dream and got really freaked out thinking nothing was real and I was in the matrix or something for like a year. But in the end I just got over it I know everything's real but the feeling that everything's a dream has persisted on and off ever since. 
It's really annoying. 

Like I've googled it and I get that it sounds like derealisation but it never feels as severe as it describes like I'm still very aware of everything around me and my memory is fine. The worst it gets is that things might sound muffled which can be a pain cause while I can hear what someone's saying I can't hear them?? If that makes sense?? I can zone out quite a bit but too bad I can snap out of it pretty easy and my concentration can be really bad when it comes to doing work but who's isn't. Oh and I don't know if it's related but my head can feel muffled idk how to describe it. Like imagine that kind of fuzzy dizzy headache you get on a long car ride it's like that.
 
Now it isn't that bad all the time but the dream like feeling is sporadically but persistently there over the years. What's really kinda worrying me is that I can't really tell when it is or isn't happening anymore. It's always kinda there? Like if I think about it I'll feel it. I've had it for so long I stopped really thinking about it unless it got really bad. That is until I mentioned it to a friend about a month ago and she explained that this is *probably* not normal. Since then I've kinda been over thinking it and it has made me realize it can be really annoying. It's so hard to have a good time when your head is that fuzzy or you're just generally unsettled by the feeling. 

I just don't really want this to be my entire life. It's not always this bad I can forget about it for stretches but it always comes back and usually for quite a while. Now is one of those times and I'm just so frustrated cause I don't want to feel like this anymore. I'm sick of it. Like I know it's nothing compared to what others go through but this can't be normal. Am I just over reacting?

104,"Hi, so I have recently been experiencing this thing where whenever I get really upset or angry etc I freak out and react badly, but I don’t really remember doing so when I have calmed down. For example, if I have an argument with my partner and get really upset, to me it feels as though the fight went for far less time than it really did, and I don’t really remember what I said or did. It is like my mind leaves the situation. I recently started seeing a psychologist to deal with other issues such as bad anxiety but I am just wondering if anyone knows what this might be caused by. Thanks in advance",30Mar2019,1
105,"First off, I would recommend not reading this if you are sensitive to this kind of thing, self harm. There's going to be a lot about that subject in here.

&amp;#x200B;

So, onto the post I suppose. Basically, I'm posting about my experiences with self harm, and more or less asking if anyone knows of any other ways to self harm, that may or may not be less destructive/visible. 

I've self harmed in 4ish ways, that I know of. Firstly, cutting. I've got probably a 3 dozen shallow tissue cut scars up and down my arms, though none in areas that could lead to bleeding out. Another is burning myself. I've only done that one a few times, 3 at most I would say, but I think I ended up with a third degree burn on one of them. These two forms of self harm have done the most in what I needed them for. One time, before I was cutting myself I think, or maybe at the time I didn't have access to a knife; I would be in class scratching my arm with sharpened fingernails. I ended up gouging? a hole in my arm maybe 1 or 2 mm deep and maybe 4 cm in diameter, roughly. It wasn't a good time. I don't know if this is how it works for everyone, but it's kind of like... Imma go nerdy here for a second. Like energy, pain cannot be destroyed, it can only be converted. Basically I convert any emotional pain I am in at the time, that has either been building up or happened in an acute timeframe, into physical pain. Now, again, don't know if that's how it works for everyone else when they self harm, but that's how it works for me. And things like holding a piece of ice against my skin, or using rubber bands to flick myself. I guess the transfer isn't efficient enough? Again, nerdy physics talk but yeah (I'm a scientist at heart). The final form of self harm, that I have been doing constantly for many years now, is self starving. For quite a few years now, to the point it feels weird to not do it, I have only been having one meal a day, at most. I'll have some snacks throughout the day sometimes, but for the most part it's just dinner, and I usually won't even eat all of it. This one isn't so much like the other two forms of self harm. It's more of a self loathing way almost. I don't know how to put it into words exactly on why I do it, it just feels natural for me to only eat one meal. Not natural as in my body only needs one meal a day, but more so that I feel it's only natural for 'someone like me' to only eat one meal. 

Not really sure why I especially posted this here, I just needed to put it out there I suppose? I dunno. I feel like, as I'm typing this, that I'm almost speaking to myself. It reminds me of a quote, ""If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"" I feel as though I'm the only one in the world that is like this, like I'm the only one. Now, of course I'm not. The logical side of my brain knows it, and even acknowledges that there are many out there that have it worse. But when I'm in a more emotional state, when logic kinda just doesn't exist, it feels like nobody in the world understands what I'm going through, and it sucks because it makes me push people away. Well, makes me is probably not the right word for it, but yeah. I dunno. I'm gonna end my post here.

106,"So, I have three friends- one I’ve known for nearly two years, and two I met 5 months ago.
One has a boyfriend and the others are single. [this factor will be important after]. Sorry but this probably will be all over the place.

So recently aka the last few months I’ve started to notice I’m putting in ALL THE EFFORT. 
For example: I used to ask the one with the boyfriend let’s call them ‘Y’. to hang out but all they do is hang out with their partner - like in the 2 years I’ve known Y I’ve probably hung out with them 6 times. So friend Y are always talking about their problems, love to be the centre of attention especially men’s attention, even though they have a fucking boyfriend and constantly need validation from people even though they know they aren’t hideous! They believe that they are close friends with people they maybe have met once however try too make it seem that I’m below them and that ‘friend’ likes them more than me even though that ‘friend’ is my boyfriends best friend. In addition, Y wouldn’t be part of the friend group if it wasn’t for their boyfriend. Nevertheless, I am only contacted for nights outs, opinions on outfits or if they think there is a party they can get going to because I’m going. .... The most annoying part is they want everyone too believe we are best friends and try too even convince me we are good friends. In addition, will lie too my face e.g. I asked them too hang out with me and the two other friends and they started to lie and as soon as they heard ‘that friend’ is having a party they suddenly were like yeah I’m free let’s go.

Anyway, the other two friends I’ve just met however, they are kinda the same as Y. We only hang out when they want too or when they aren’t ‘busy’- busy being idk. One just wants too go out with me when they think they can get with someone I know or going to a specific place. The other friend makes me feel like I’m in competition with them and always ALWAYS tries to one up me and tbh I’m the type of person that’s competitive in nature but this person really takes it too another level- they always believe they are right. I always am the one too ask too hang out but always get rejected unless as I said they can gain something from it- I feel like all they do is make excuses up too not hang out or make me feel like I’m ridiculous for asking too hang out and are just kinda rude af too me.

This is honestly starting to impact be badly I feel stupid for wanting company, asking to hang out, that I’m needy or that I’m the problem. I have anxiety, depression, PTSD and honestly they just amp how I feel in a negative way.

I just give up on trying, to the point I just want them too either be like stop being friends with me or be open. 

Am I a problem? Idk.

107,"I hate having anxiety, but it was a relief to be diagnosed with GAD (Generalised anxiety disorder). 

I was sixteen when I was diagnosed. I went to the doctors after what felt like a nervous breakdown. I was tearful, shaky, having panic attacks, and I couldn’t form a sentence due to my shaky voice. 

I was referred to a local mental health service. During the telephone assessment, after reading out my answers to the questionaire I filled in, I was told that I couldn’t join group therapy because my anxiety score was too high. 

I was placed on a waiting list, that to be honest was too long. Anyway, fast forward and I stopped my medication because I thought I was better. I managed to handle my anxiety disorder until now. 

It started off with being stressed out this time. Stressed and wound up. Eventually, it turned to me wanting to hurt myself. Then, anxiety. 

I was having 2-3 panic attacks a day. I did think that they would kill me, I could feel my heart beating so hard during these attacks. I would get hot flushes, my body tingly, my vision blurry. 

On Tuesday, I went back to the doctor and was prescribed Propranolol once again. 

I hate this anxiety. It feels like I’m in a dark room with no windows or door, and I’m just trapped with no way out. I feel like I’m a lost cause and that I’m never going to recover from this. I do want this to go away, but it never gives me a break. 

I feel that this disorder is preventing me from moving into work (currently unemployed and seeking work). 

It’s easy for people to say: “Calm down”, “Chill out”, “Go for a walk”. None of those things help me. I’ve tried everything, even taking deep breaths. But when the feeling of anxiety kicks in, I know that I’m in for a heavy, intense ride. 

My father was a diagnosed Schizophrenic. My grandmother has anxiety. My brothers and sister has anxiety. I don’t know if this plays a factor. 

I don’t know what I did to deserve this. What did I do so wrong that I deserved to be punished with this? I feel at fault for almost everything.
