0,"I feel really dumb asking this as I’ve struggled with depression myself for years. I feel like i should know, but i feel impatient with him and i don’t like it. I feel like i can’t every say the right thing and like i’m not helpful. I feel like all I can do is listen. I don’t wanna make suggestions on what he should do because i know he probably already knows. I’ve tried to give him options for giving help since his insurance won’t cover a therapist. I don’t wanna pressure him too much but he doesn’t wanna talk about things, doesn’t wanna hang out, and doesn’t seem to wanna get help. I know it’s hard to get help and hard to dig yourself out of the rut. I’ve just become really impatient and i need help. Have any suggestions on things i can do or say that might actually help? Or things i can do to remind myself to be more patient?",12Oct2019,1
1,Recently I just lost my first ever pet. He wasn’t old in the slightest and it was very sudden. I’m not handling it too well. No one is really understanding how much my little guy meant to me and are telling me to get over it. Any advise on how I can cope a little better?,12Oct2019,1

3,"I keep forgetting my train of thought. Sorry if I'm stumbling all over the place, please comment if you're confused as to what I'm saying.

It feels like I'm day dreaming everyday, every hour.

I used to think (atleast) i was the funny guy. The one who would crack jokes and just laugh. I can't even have a normal conversation with my friends, I just keep zoning out. Everything feels colourless and numb. I also experience sometimes I'm not even phased when something serious happens, it feels like I'm watching a movie.

I'm also terrified that I can't remember how I felt, when i finally got the courage to ask help from a doctor.

I seem to feel different every other day. I could be sad for days, sometimes playing around with the thought of suicide (Not that I'd ever go through with it). And then f.eks I get good news and then everything seems to turn around for a little time. 

People say I'm cold and I understand that, it still makes me sad though, I don't wanna be cold I want to laugh and have a good time.

I have all these thoughts and emotions but still it doesn't feel real. It feels like my head is stuffed with cotton.

I don't know if this is normal. It doesn't feel good. Maybe I'm just telling myself all this. Maybe I want to be like this.",12Oct2019,1

6,"We’ve all heard that staying in bed all day or intrusive thoughts are the bane of some people’s existences. Everyone is encouraged to go seek professional help if they suspect they are suffering from any illness.

However, I’ve noticed a trend, in myself and others. The fear of seeking help because they don’t want to lose the positive aspects of their mental illness.

Someone may have abandonment issues; so they treat their partner like royalty, and said partner loves them just as equally. Still damaging.
Someone may have a strong fear of disapproval, and work their ass off to have the best work ethic in their company. Still damaging. 
Someone may have a hard time saying no, and come off as easygoing. They make a lot of friends, but are constantly worn out. Damaging,

That’s just a few off the top of my head, but my point is: look past the exceptions. Just because a possible symptom seems positive in one way, doesn’t mean you should ignore it. 

I can understand why someone may choose to ignore their problems if they are portrayed in this way. You may fear getting help because “you seem to be doing just fine,” or “just keep up the good work.” But, let’s be honest, if you are wanting help and a professional turns you away for being too “normal” you’d want a different professional anyway.

Hope this helped someone resolve any turmoil they have about mental health. Go see someone :)",12Oct2019,37

Tonight, I'm lighting a joint. Yesterday, it was acid. Last week, a molly bender. I always hope for something groundbreaking, so that I may finally feel, I don't know, anything.

But, I'll never truly be a person. I'll never experience any emotions besides apathy, contempt, and sadness. Everyone believes I'm this wonderful, happy-go-lucky individual, and they're wrong. That's why I'm here, on this sub, writing this.

9,"I’ve been pretty bad lately, getting worse. Basically the only thing I can think of at this point that might help is meds. 

Is it possible to get them from just a regular doctor? 

I really... REALLY.. don’t want to talk to a therapist. It won’t help. I won’t be able to talk without breaking down. I don’t have time for consistent appointments. 

I don’t even want to talk to a doctor but I know I would have to. 

Basically what I’m asking is, what does someone have to do (in the us if that helps) to get prescribed something?

Idk what would even help me. Anti depressants? Anxiety meds? Idk. As far as I know there isn’t anything specifically meant for constant homicidal thoughts. I know I have depression so I just assume anti depressants would be the way to go right?",12Oct2019,6
10,"To be honest I’m not exactly 100% versed in what bipolar entails. 

My step dad has bipolar (not sure which type), he hasn’t seen his psychiatrist in 1.5 years (he said 1.5 years, but he lies a lot, so I wouldn’t be surprised if it was longer than 1.5 years.)

He has been exhibiting some type of manic symptoms that have been getting progressively worse since that time. (I’m not sure about the exact differences between hypomania and mania), stuff like not sleeping for weeks, being a lot more hyperactive in his mood and actions, buying a lot of things every day that have no purpose in relation to anything and becoming very, very angry/combative when we “criticise” him or even suggest to him that he should see his doctor. One of the most major things is that he has become very inconsiderate of people’s property and how they feel. 

By criticise I mean suggesting that he improve his diet, things as simple as that make him very combative.  (since he stopped seeing his doctor he ONLY eats chocolate and ice cream, not sure if that has anything to do with manic behaviour.) 

If I recall, he has always been a little on the manic side, but since he stopped seeing his doctor it’s gotten very noticeably worse. 

I highly suspect that he has stopped taking his meds, or the alcohol he drinks minimises the effect of them, around the time he stopped seeing his psychiatrist, he started abusing hyoscine hydrobromide everyday, (used for travel sickness, but illicit doses cause what I call “drug induced Alzheimer’s”) 

I’m just wondering if it will “get better” or if we need to step in and make some decisions for him, while he is in this state.",12Oct2019,1
11,I will be starting to see a mental health professional soon. I tried this once before but it was a shit situation and didn’t work out. But one of the problems I had before was this feeling I deal with where I always feel like I have to be polite and accommodating so I downplay my issues. How do you get over this. Or be truthful with your dr. I know this sounds like a stupid question and I’m sorry I didn’t know where else to ask.,12Oct2019,1

13,"I apologize for the terrible way this was written. I'm in a rush.

What is wrong with me.

As a small child, I apparently had a bad temper. I was extremely sensitive. I would cry if I was jokingly picked on... 
I was very musically inclined and would hum whatever my mother sang to me.
My first words (not word) was, ""momma baby up"" at around 8 months.
I could read at an early age, and could remember long wording, without knowing the meaning. (Words like inclined) I was in daycare, kindergarten.

I never really liked playing with kids my age. Emotionally, I was on the sour side. Grew irritated when visiting relatives in another province.

I remember math wasn't really a struggle when I was younger, but in kindergarten we were learning how to count by fives, which I literally couldn't get it. One of the last ones in class to get it.

This one point, I was doing a count the dots map thing, where you connect dots by number. I used to be able to do it very well. But this one evening (I was around 5) I literally couldn't remember what number came after what. My sister (Who is 19 years older) thought I was joking, and laughed. That was frustrating. 

So as years went by, I entered into grade 3. For some reason, something in me changed, and I genuinely liked to be around kids my age. I was well liked by all peers. I was still a little weird. A friend and I (rachelle) would make up charectars in our heads, made up stories around them. We made a song literally called, ""old moosy is dead"" (long story) and sang it to the class. We made different charectars like: killer (a penciltop who had murderous tendencies) Queen snail, moosy (large moose that was tame)

Anyways, grade 3 and 4 ended. 

I switched schools. 

Schoolwork I absolutely hated. I remember eventually not understanding math... I would sometimes write complicated answers and finally come up with the right answer. The teacher always was puzzled, because writing the answer out would have been easier a certain other way I didn't think of.

Writing back then wasva strong suit. I remember writing a story in grade 1 about a princess called sapphire who was captured by an evil wizard who took her away.

Grade4: switched schools. After finding a dead mole in someone's backyard, I instantly had a large obsession with moles. Wrote stories, studied them, drew pictures. Thought of myself as a mole. (I would translation from human form to mole form)

At this point in time, I was in psychologist offices... my parents thought I was on the autism spectrum... but even as a child I could read emotions very well, had no trouble reading social cues. Tough looking back there was obsession, immaturity, imagination and something in my head that couldn't grasp concepts like other children could....

I remember number 4 would be my number. If shake my toothbrush four times to dry it out, would flap my arms and hands very fast to dry them, counting at least 16 times (writing this is making me laugh)

 Eventually, I started getting bullied. I developed very bad social anxiety. 
Which is now turning into generalized anxiety.

Over the years, I had people call me smart, to stupid, ditz, dumb, etc. And then, to smart.

During my teens, I had a constant feeling of sadness in the background. During early 20's, it became more extreme. I'd feel normal, and then have nights where I wanted to die.deep deep sadness. I planned my suicide, but never went through with it.

Things are still very up and down.

My personality has now turned back to not really wanting to be too much around people. Not so much social anxiety, I've pretty much gotten over that... but I feel like I have to fake enjoy talking, being with people. Sometimes it's okay,and I enjoy talking... but for the majority, I feel like I can see through all the bs... and I don't wish to talk. Because of my social anxiety I had in the past, I realized i was ""re-learning"" how to socialize with people. Sometimes I would be tired of all the social niceties and get straight to the point of being blunt and saying it. This was rude, so I altered how to socially approach people. I then wanted to act more genuine, but realized people normally prey on those that were vulnerable, and it is okay to have a social mask... 

I am extremely lonely. I rarely open up to people because of being bullied. My counting to 8 has stopped... but sometimes I feel I don't ""get"" certain things with people. When I was young, I used to believe sarcasm, or not get it. Now I'm more in tune with that.

My dad's side of the family has a lot of mental health issues. My aunt had paranoid schizophrenia. My other aunt, anxiety. My other, other aunt had suicidal tendencies. My dad told me he thought he had bipolar, then he realized it wasn't true.

We both slightly agreed we might be on a wavelength of ASD... he, moreso. 


I am still very sensitive. Unsure of myself. Very self critical. Very large lack of confidence.

I'm physically beautiful, very musically talented. I used to write stories and draw. Imagination was something that lit up my inner world. I attracted guys easily. But always the one to breakup with them. I got them, they never got me, they think they did... but I chameleoned myself unintentionally towards them. His a lot of myself from them because I was so scared to be "" weird""

I have no idea what the fuck my issue is.",12Oct2019,10
14,"(Using a throwaway account just to vent about this, I don't want this affecting my personal life or people finding out my main account)   


I'm going to try to keep this short, since it isn't the main focus. Last year in December, I ended up getting together with someone who I had known a few years prior to us dating. During the first month, everything was great, we'd call often and see each other every week. As time went on though, things started getting worse and the blame was always on me. Anytime I'd make a small mistake, they would hold it over my head. Eventually they started doing it more as time went on, I always just accepted it since I had my full trust in them. After the relationship ended in July, I had believed that I was some abuser and manipulator. They had accused me of physically abusing them whenever I had accidentally elbowed and stepped on their foot a few times, which shouldn't be surprising especially when we were often close physically. After my family had told me that I hadn't been abusive towards him (they saw our messages to each other) I realized that they had taken anything they could to make me seem like an abuser. They made false allegations against me, thankfully not public and just to people they knew.  They were upset with me when I tried talking to them after, calling me names and overall just being rude to me. They had pretty bad depression and would be upset with me when I didn't know how to handle it, which I wasn't experienced with depression at the time, and I'm not even an adult. We stopped communication  I ended up trying to take my life twice over the summer, both were unsuccessful of course. 

Onto the mental health part, when I tried taking my life for the first time, I did what I could to stop the affects of the medication I had tried to overdose on. After, I thought I was over them, and tried continuing on with my life. As time went on, I started having more suicidal thoughts and just would be in pain over what all happened with my ex. I don't remember much after my second attempt, all I remember is that I didn't tell anyone about it until a week later. A bit after, I ended up dating someone else, who I am still currently with. Although, knowing I didn't abuse my ex like they said I did, it still haunts me. I'm afraid that I'm not doing good enough for my current partner, and if I feel like I've messed up, I try to not make the mistake again. My partner tells me I haven't messed up, but I feel like I have. Although, that's not what I've been too focused on. During class recently, we were going over something that involved a word that had basically given me flash backs of what happened with my ex. I was on the verge of an anxiety/panic attack throughout most of the day. Even after I was more calm, it kicked up again and I ended up just breaking down when I had gotten home. I haven't heard the word be said again since, but I'll still get anxious and paranoid at times. I can't go into town without being constantly on guard, watching out for them or their car. Even when I'm not in that town, I'm still on guard and watching out. I've changed my online identity, name, and everything else I could to avoid them finding me. I'm in constant fear due to them and I don't know what to do at this point.  I don't want to bring this up to my parents, I don't exactly trust them and don't have a therapist. This is mainly just a vent since I'm dealing with another emotional episode. But I will say, my mental state has improved since my last suicide attempt. I don't have suicidal thoughts anymore and don't have depressive episodes much. I've been a lot more happier since I've gotten with my partner. I just don't know who to go to about this. I haven't experienced anything like this in the past.",12Oct2019,2
15,"I quit my old job because I was losing my mind, my boss kept commenting on my weight (I have an ed) and made light of some serious mental health issue that he knew about. I quit on the spot after he had a fit of rage that he took out on me. When we had the conversation he said that I’ve changed, that I’m forgetful, make little mistakes, quiet, not like myself, that even customers notice, and maybe my medication is to blame and I should either stop taking them or find a new one. 

Mind you I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt last October and he knew about it. Even gave me two weeks off. He had an attempt when he was my age so I thought he understood my situation. That was a life changing situation. I was diagnosed BP1 and had all my meds changed and a lot of them have forgetfulness as a side effect as do most antidepressants and mood stabilizers. I know I’m different. I’m always going to be different now. I never thought I was letting it effect my performance. I’m a waitress and I always know how to put on that fake customer service smile on. That’s how I make my money...

Well after being unemployed for a month I have a new job. A chance to start over. But right off the bat I’m fucking up. Making “little mistakes, forgetful...” Everyshift I go in thinking okay I’m gunna do well today. You won’t forget because you have a notepad to write things down, you’re pacing yourself, you even have people willing to help you since you’re new. But nope. I’m fucking up constantly. My boss is nice. But weirdly nice. She has that kind of fake monotone nice voice that I don’t know if she’s mad, tired, or fed up. I know we are short staffed so she’s probably overworked and stressed so I don’t think I’m helping relieve any of that. 

It sucks walking into work everyday waiting to hear what I did wrong the previous day. Or leaving with horrible anxiety about what I could have possibly done wrong. Today I left and got home and remember something I forgot to do and tonight was my first closing shift without her there and she was hesitant about it and I fucked up. 

I’m waiting for her to sit me down and talk to me about all this. Maybe not fire me but yeah. My old boss works there and is the one who recommended me to come apply and he probably regrets that decision. 

I feel like my mental illness will forever hold me back from having any stable job. It always lasts for about a few years then I either get extreamly burnt out, overwhelmed, bored and just quit. I want to be stable so bad. I’m quickly going to be at an age where I can no longer bounce from job to job. I want to be somewhere where I can grow and learn. 

And I’ve talked to this with other coworkers and everyone has the same thing to say: “you’re new don’t worry!! She won’t get mad, stuff like that happens all the time!”

23,"Perhaps you've found the right medication(s) and feel as though your ailment(s) are under control. But what if you still struggle holding a job? This is something I struggle with in regard to my mental health. In using medication I've reacquainted myself with the sandman yet what about becoming a productive member of society?

One of my greatest fears is that there's something about my primary state that precludes me from working 5 days a week. The longest I've held a job was about a year and it was as a part time dishwasher. Since then I've worked in call centers, welding and pipefitting gigs, collected signatures for petitions, worked as a line cook in busy restaurants, worked warehouse and factory jobs, sold kirby vacuum cleaners, expodited food orders, sold psychedelic drugs, cashiered for CVS, designed a logo for a company, worked in the deli at Costco, and persuaded people door-to-door to change their provider of natural gas. Of all these jobs none of them lasted very long.

It wasn't that I lacked the skills necessary to succeed--at least not at the job. My problems existed during the time I wasn't working. Managing a healthy lifestyle in-between shifts proved difficult. I was never efficient at planning my meals ahead, paying my bills, achieving 8 hours of sleep at night, maintaining interpersonal relationships, et cetera. When I was working everything else in my life fell by the wayside until my jobs ended for a myriad of reasons.

I was fired a couple of times but usually quit when I could no longer manage the baffling experience of being human. The recurring cycles of stress eventually led to severe mental illness and stays in inpatient facilities. It took me 4 years to get my insomnia and anxiety under control.

Something I rarely share with people is my difficulty with processing information and expressing myself. I notice that I have some characteristics of obsessive compulsive disorder, though my mind is usually too scattered and stressed to carry out the pathology associated with the disorder. I seek order but rarely attain it.

To cope with my lack of preparedness I learned to create a meal replacement shake that contains all the vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and macronutrients necessary to sustain myself. This solved the problem of leaving my home without lunch for work.

Eventually I applied for disability and my case was approved. I would prefer working, but every time I try a new job I'm too stressed to see it through for an extended period of time.

My dream is to be as successful with self hypnosis as some of the people I've hypnotized. I've had 14 subjects and most of them were able to recall and anchor idealized states of mind for future use. If I can achieve similar success then perhaps working 40 hours per week will become my reality. 

I recently found a new place to live where and I have high hopes for realizing my dreams. I'm trying to live in the present moment and work with my strengths.

25,"So as a warning, this is prolly gonna be kinda long, so sorry. 

I also did post this recently in r / advice but I wanted another perspective and I’m really struggling, so sorry if this is not allowed. 

As a sort of trigger warning, I don’t mention any specific numbers regarding my anorexia or calorie counts, but I do talk about my struggles with recovery and feelings 

Right now I am a 2nd year student who moved 3 weeks ago to a new country I’ve always wanted to live in on an exchange program through the college one of my parents is a professor at. I’m also a 19 yr old F. I’m using this as an opportunity to make a new start here, and so far things are going really great, I am socializing more, and actually making friends for one of the first times in my life. I am genuinely much happy over here. 

However...I still have a lot of baggage from my past I am trying to manage or overcome and recover from.

I’ve struggled with depression, anxiety, a verbally/emotional abusive gymnastics coach the last 4 years I did competitive gymnastics (I quit at age 17), a verbally/emotionally abusive narcissistic parent, and being over all sheltered as the ‘pet’ of my parent.  (My other parent is okay, but worked a lot so I didn’t get much interaction. I am on okay terms with them now) N parent wasn’t as bad as some of the stories I’ve read on the raisedbynarcissits subreddit, but both my other parent, therapist, and doctor have told me they think parent is a narcissist. 

On top of all that shit, I’ve had anorexia for 3 years now. Last year moved across country to a new state for college. That college ended up not being financially viable, wasn’t what I expected, and so I ended up having to come back home over the summer. While in my first year, I started to try eating a more ‘normal’ amount but still not enough and had a very restrictive mindset. I was finally diagnosed with anorexia here, and decided I wanted to try and get better over the summer.

Over the summer,my anorexia relapsed when I went to the doctor and found out I had gained a small amount of weight from what was diagnosed to be hypothyroidism, even though I had been restricting calories and working out at the gym 5 days/week and walking a few miles every day. I was still at an underweight, but not as bad as I was before. My anorexia did get pretty bad during the first year regarding physical health and I had any and all the stereotypical anorexia symptoms. Being near my N parent and also feeling like a ‘fake’ anorexic because my body didn’t work like a normal one, caused me to relapse. I did end up losing back the weight I had gained from my hypothyroidism through the relapse. On top of that, having debilitating fatigue, being worn out from the previous kinda stressful year of college, and dealing with my depression and existential nihilism, I was not in a good place. 

I was seeing a therapist every two weeks, which I found very helpful, and I did get a new primary care doctor who helped me get antidepressants and on a synthroid for my hypothyroidism. I was diagnosed also with major depressive disorder, general anxiety, and on spectrum for OCD. The antidepressants are working okay, and I don’t feel like sobbing over the smallest thing anymore, but I still have a general melancholy when alone, disinterest in things I like and struggle with everything feeling meaningless. 

However...even though I am still underweight, I am not as underweight as I was in the past, nor as underweight as I should have been if I didn’t have hypothyroidism or like what a stereotypical anorexic looks like. 

Since I moved over here to the new country, I have upped my calorie count to an almost normal level and I do feel much more mental clarity and better. I no longer am triggered by my narcissistic parent to keep restricting and I am trying continue my learning of the language of this country so I can break free completely and become my own person, and don’t have to ask for money for necessities (still financially dependent unfortunately). I did apply for a part time job and have started to try and start selling prints of my art I make on the side to save up for continuing my studies in this country next year. And I haven’t gained any weight yet. I did buy a scale to track my weight and only weigh myself once in the morning. 

However, I have been craving sweets and carbs like crazy and I want to eat all the sweets I can find because I am so hungry and everything here is so delicious and new. I guess I should mention I was a vegan for the last 8 months, but I did switch back to being a vegetarian since veganism isn’t really known in this country and I’m trying to be less restrictive. I want to eat all the cookies and pastries and noodles and tofu even after I have a normal person sized meal. I feel like I am always hungry. But I don’t want to turn into having binge eating disorder or gain a ton of weight.my doctor wants me to get to the recommended amount of calories for an adult person, and I am trying to focus on eating at least the amount I have for the last 3 weeks  so my hormones can stabilize, but I have no one to talk to and I feel like I’m going insane. 

I can message my doctor, and she was really helpful in the beginning, but I think I sent too many long walls of text of questions about recovery and my inner turmoil and now I think she got irritated because she used to send a paragraph or two response and would be nice, but her response to my last message was very frank and literally only one sentence. 

My parent I am on okay terms with does t understand mental illnesses and I am trying to limit contact with N parent. I am making friends now, but I can’t open up to them yet about all this sob stuff because a) I am only at an intermediate level in the language and wouldn’t be able to properly convey my feelings, and b) I doubt they would really know how to deal with all the shit going on. I have had a video therapy session with my therapist once and I’m going to continue doing that every 2 weeks, but I feel so needy and like I need constant stimulation of people around me to feel re-affirmation that I exist. I am an introvert and used to be okay by myself but now I have to constantly listen to background noise when I’m in my room or I feel like I’m not real and like I’m going crazy. I’ve also had a nightmare every single night since I’ve been here of my N parent and that has been unsettling me too...


TL;DR: Moved out 3 weeks ago to a new country from narcissistic parent to study. Doing much better away from the crazy of my parent but managing MDD, anorexia recovery, feeling existential nihilism, and trying to reintegrate as a normal functioning person with no one to talk to is hard. Also having cravings for sweets and am worried about getting fat. 

Idk I just need some advice please. I am generally doing much better over here, and I really love this country and the people here, but not having anyone to talk to about anorexia and my narcissistic parent any time I feel like I need reassurance or validation while I’m trying to recover from is hard.",12Oct2019,3
26,"So I’m kinda new to Reddit in regarding of how it works (idk why I find it so hard to understand how it works and how the different communities work). But I need someone’s help. 
So I’m a 21 F, and for a while now I’ve developed “habits” I guess you could call it, or coping mechanisms for when I’m angry or sad. When I was younger whenever I was sad or something went wrong with school or I was angry I would cut myself, i know you’re probably imagining this deep bloody cut, it wasn’t. It was just a scratch. 
But now when I’m really angry, wanting to punch a hole through the wall type of angry, since I couldn’t scream and crying was not enough, I would bite my arm. And last time I bit myself so hard I left a bruise. And last night, I was studying for an exam and I realized that there was something that I forgot to study, and I started panicking and I got so pissed of that I stucked a pencil in my thigh, like for fucks sake wtf, i didn’t think much of it and I just saw that I have a big ass bruise! Now today, I came back from the exam and I didn’t get a good grade even though I studied my ass off, and I cried for like 2 hours straight. I would sometimes not even eat for 12 or more hours just as a punishment to myself. 
I have this self destructive “habits”  that I know they are not normal, or maybe other people do it too but just, like me, hide it from others. It seems like even the smallest of inconveniences throw me off balance. I don’t know if this is just the way I am, meaning that I have no temper when it comes to handling situations, or because I have to much shit going on inside of me that stupid minor situations that to other people would seem normal, feel like hell to me and I just have to concentrate all that turbulence of feelings in physical pain. 
And sometimes it feels like a roller coaster, I’m fine, not necessarily happy but ok, and then the SMALLEST SHIT like me not understanding something at college or missing the bus can put me in a bad mood for the rest of the day, or make me really sad. And I’m just tired of living like this, being happy and getting so sad, wanting to lay in bed not paying attention to anybody all of the sudden. And the next day I’m okay, “happy”, and then at night I suddenly want to be left alone for no reason and disappear. I don’t know why I feel like this, but it’s so tiring for me and I know that for my family it is too. 
So can someone identify with this?? Am I the only one that feels like this? Could there be a real medical problem going on?? Or am I just a little messed up like the rest of the world, but nothing new?? I feel like I need, not even want, to go to a physiologist to see what’s going on, or maybe should I go to a doctor?? Help me cause I’m so freaking lost",12Oct2019,2

32,So I haven’t been to a psychiatrist in about 2 years now. It seems like every time I have gone (this time will be the 4th) I get a new/different diagnosis. This appointment I think I might be diagnosed with bipolar. I was always positive I wasn’t bipolar because I have family members that are and I never had any of the symptoms that they did. But my past doctors thought that I might be so they put me on antidepressants that wouldn’t set me into a manic episode if I was. But finally after a few years they decided to try Zoloft which will offset your bipolar if you have it. I’ve been on it ever since and I’ve DEFINITELY had some manic episodes that lasted months at a time. Talking it over with my therapist she doesn’t think it’s a reach for me to be bipolar. I’ve just heard so many bad things about bipolar medications that I’m so nervous to be prescribed them (idk if I even will be yet) but I know I definitely need a change in my meds so I’m looking forward to getting a change but anxious to what that might be.,12Oct2019,2

I’m currently a university student who lives on campus and I’ve gone through a lot this year, I had my heart broken for the first time, counselled most of my friends out of suicide when I was suicidal, battled with bulimia, drank and done drugs too much, self harmed for the first time in a year, have been assaulted and recently had an unexpected miscarriage. 

I have chronic depression and social anxiety and I’ve decided to go back to my family home for two weeks to try and get myself into an okay routine and make myself feel a little bit better. I’m not sure I will be able to finish this semester or not but right now my goal is to feel better mentally. 

So far I’ve decided to wake up before 10 am, regularly take my anti depressants (which I’m on week 1 of currently), eat well and healthy, exercise when I can/feel like it, keep up a skincare regime. I know this sounds like a lot but in the past a lot of this i have been able to do especially at home and it has helped me. I’m looking for any other suggestions to make myself feel better, I will be staying sober (which is too difficult while I am on campus as it is one of the main forms of socialising).

I don’t have any mental illnesses or any that run in my family so I strongly believe I’m mentally healthy but, about a year I go I ended up getting in a flight with my best friend we haven’t made up since and I had a big trip planned prior so I didn’t go out for a while in order to save money. It’s not 4 months past after my trip and I still barely maintain any friendships besides maybe a “acquaintanceship”. I have always been social and had many friends in the past and used to motivated to always go hang out and go out and party but now I sit at home on weekends and don’t even want to make an effort to see anyone. The problem is deep down I don’t want to see anyone and not socialize and I’ve become more cynical because of it.

Usually there’s a trigger for these, and they only last 10-20 minutes. I also haven’t had the chance to talk about this with my therapist, and I couldn’t find anything online about both of these.

47,"I was in a really dark spot for the last year or so and almost killed myself in August. I had a date, the equipment, my note written, and everything.

Because people grew attached I felt guilty about doing it and made the decision to not do it. 

Recently friend noticed that I don’t eat lunch and confronted me about it. This person also knows that I self harm, have schizophrenic tendencies, and have had a history of suicidal thoughts, but they understand. This friend had an eating disorder so it was easier for them to tell I guess. 

I trust them with so much because they have become a huge part of my support system so I told them the truth; I haven’t eaten anything more then a granola bar a day for over a month now, and before that it was a macaroni cup and a granola bar a day. They made me promise to eat at least one full meal a day and I did want to keep that promise, I just couldn’t do it though, I didn’t even keep the promise for a single day. I made food but didn’t even eat half of it before I couldn’t force anymore down my throat.

To sum things up I do use cocaine as a self medicating mechanism. Foremost to the addiction I do have depression, anxiety, and ptsd. Skip down to “Conclusion” to continue discussion.


Story Begins:

One year recap: last year this time cocaine was not affecting my job, nor health (to a certain extent)  but I was ready to stop. I don’t use every day, nor every week. I had a full time 9-5 job (Still have same job) and mostly used on weekends. My first successful step to get help was at a behavioral health services organization. They were too booked to offer me counseling with my insurance (and still are to this day). So Ive only saw an NP (specifically a PMHNP). 

She only scheduled appointments every 2-3 months. Her only role was medication management(which took me a while to understand). Our appointments never lasted more than 10 minutes and she changed my medications every time. 10 different meds in a years time. 

After having the worst mental and physical year of my life (and also least usage in years)...I have gone to the ER 10 times this year. Not while using but either a day or a week after. Each time due to panic attacks however each time I felt as if I was dying and never would have assumed they were panic attacks. Side note: I live in a region of Ohio well known as the opioid capital. If you wonder that I’m searching for drugs? No...I was never prescribed anything more than Ativan or ibuprofen. Hospitals, including my “PMHNP” don’t prescribe scheduled-drugs

Eventually I come to tealize this relationship wasn’t working. 

Current Day:

I joined an Intensive Outpatient Program. (IOP). I filed an FMLA claim, got flex hours at work , told my family, my dealer (who blacklisted
me for 3 weeks) and was fully committed to this new possibility. 

The IOP was a more akin to summer camp for adults. It was 4 hours each day., 3 days a week. First 2 hours was group therapy. There were usually less than 10 of us with all types of addictions, most were alcohol( medically monitored), some pills, only me cocaine. 

For two hours we got to hear each other’s problems. Which gave me so much anxiety. Listening to people’s  problems was very stressful for me. 


The next hour was a nutrition class. Discussing basic food knowledge, affects of drugs, alcohol. Almost like DARE. 
Then the last hour was a group activity: painting, playing cards, watching videos.  

After 2 weeks (I did not use during this time) listening everyday to how Sherry drank a 12 pack of beer and she doesn’t remember anything from last night. 1 hour of playing UNO. Getting randomly pulled for a few minutes to meet with the RN for prescription management. Who has no notes from our group therapy, asks a couple questions and is prepared to prescribe mind altering, life affecting drugs? 

I know this is really wordy which is not generally my style. But I reached out to the practice manager via email asking for help and she was so defensive told me if I didn’t like it to look elsewhere. Even though I never discredited her program rather asked if a more personalized approach was available. 

Conclusion:
I don’t understand how there is a disconnect between medication management and therapy. In my opinion the person who listens to your thoughts helping you understand your mind should be the same exact person prescribing you medication. To find a more traditional 1-on1 experience would I need a “psychiatrist”?",12Oct2019,3

60,"I've been anxiously depressed for more than 8 years. Diagnosed with an ""other"" form of schizophrenia for 5 years.

When I was 16, right before my illness began, I was catfished badly by a girl online. My feelings were broken, and at that moment I felt there was something wrong with humanity as a whole, because a person so hurtful could exist. I reasoned that all smart people are exploitative/selfish and all stupid people are exploited by the smart.

This caused me to feel detached from humanity. I felt loneliness, but at the time I didn't know what it was. I'd never felt lonely, and I didn't recognize it for the 8 years I've been ill. I never thought loneliness could be a mindset, but this was it; I felt lonely even with people everywhere around me.

Here's actually the video that led me to think about this issue: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MB5IX-np5fE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MB5IX-np5fE)

I just don't know what to do about these thoughts and beliefs.

I'm trying to understand what kind of community I need to find these lost feelings of belonging, but it's not easy.

I'm trying to understand what kind of beliefs I'd need, because my current beliefs just don't work, obviously.

61,"It's 6am and I can't sleep and I keep feeling bugs on me but I know there aren't any there. Everything feels dangerous, my senses feel warped at times, I've been living in a house full of strangers and as a consequence of introversion-to-a-fault I've practically imprisoned myself in my room, terrified to make a sound, trying to convince everyone that perhaps I am not really there and am merely a ghost who showers about once a week and sometimes makes the car in the driveway disappear.

But I'm home for the long weekend. Real-home, the one with my parents and their cats and a bed that has a boxspring. I don't feel like the same person who used to sleep here, though. I think I'm worse. More worn-down, distrustful, erratic. I can keep my thoughts together when I'm around other people but it all falls apart once I'm alone and *God, I spend so much time alone and God I think I'm perpetually in a state of losing it but never having lost it and God I'm hanging on like a motherfucker but I am going to need a break from this very, very soon.*

When I don't feel like a stain on humanity, I feel like a goddamned liar. I feel like I'm a different shape. I feel like I'm always somewhere I shouldn't be, always trespassing, always stepping on somebody else's toes. I'm not sad, not angry, not empty. I'm just not.",12Oct2019,4

66,"I (28F) am struggling in this one area and I need help to understand how to go about it.

So the issue is that I was raised in a manner where showing how one feels : feelings like shame, guilt, fear, disappointment, or any display of emotion is frowned upon. I thought only men struggle from this apparently it's not uncommon amongst women either.

So I am trying to talk about my emotions with my family. But I'm expecting that they will get discomforted cringe or get embarrassed when I talk to them about my feelings. 

Sharing of feelings is extremely important for the mental health and there should be no shame in talking about it. I want to know to not let it stop me from being honest and open about my feelings? How to come to terms with it? I want to know from u folks",12Oct2019,12
67,"i was doing so well. i stopped cutting myself for about a year, i managed to have a relationship that wasn’t ruined by my autism, i can’t remember the last time someone did something mean to me with actual malicious intent in school. if it weren’t for my parents everything would be fine.

i live in my electronics, the outside world scares me, i can’t talk to people irl, discord is my only escape. my parents ended up punishing me over and over again for using my electronics late (to talk to my online best friend who lives in canada) so i found a way around it and one upped it every time, now they’re going to take ALL of my electronics despite me telling them how they’re hurting me. 

this seems like a good thing, right? no. i don’t know how i’ll manage to live without them, i’ll have no social interaction at all, i’ll become more depressed, then i’d kill myself

all my parents do is shout at me, never anything nice. the only person who gets  support in any shape or form is my damned little brother, he can suck a dick. back to my parents, i told them i was going to kill my self if they did this, they just said i wasn’t gonna and no one would miss me. i told them i cut myself because i couldn’t cope without them, they said it was blackmail. they saw my cuts, i asked for help and all they did was let me flunk P.E. lessons so the teachers wouldn’t find out. i had my first mental breakdown over it, they called me a retard. i told them i have 99% of the symptoms of autism currently and did as a child as well, they didn’t get help.

i am so deprived of anything a human needs: love, affection, social interaction, support, etc

but why not just call CPS? in my house there are my 3 other siblings reliant on their income, and 2 girlfriends of my older brothers. they will all be heavily affected, along with my 4 dogs.

killing myself is the only way out of this. i want to post my suicide note all online and tell the world what those evil bastards have done. i don’t know how mentally affected by my death they would be, but their lives would be ruined, as they have ruined mine.

my death coming closer and colder. they’re not going to take my electronics today, maybe tonight? when they do they will know the consequences of their actions. 

i don’t want help, i’m not going to see or call someone about this, so don’t even bother. the amount of times i’ve seen suicide hotline numbers or have been told to call someone, it’s useless. 

just putting this out there; i don’t know if this is a vent or what. not going to put that much info about myself so i don’t get stopped, so people aren’t going to know why i killed myself. honestly i don’t even know anymore

68,"Hey everyone. Thanks for taking the time to read this. Will try to keep it short, but sorry beforehand if it becomes long.

I didn't have a great childhood. My parents were very religious growing up to the point that one day my mother forced me to throw away my Pokemon cards (2in binders) which was 3 binders worth. Growing up I was taught to be as emotional as a mountain... which in proper terms means not have any. That life was this giant enemy that would attack me and I need to harden up. I was basically forced to grow up quickly. Never was allowed to believe in Santa or the tooth fairy.

I would always see my parents fight mostly verbal but sometimes physical from both parties. I became the ""adult"" by age 6 protecting my older sister. I always joked about how I grew up the Spartan life. I'm 25m now.

Lately it has been bothering me. For example, I want to be in a relationship, and I have had gfs, but sometimes the idea of being with someone is replaced with an ugly thought. My mind starts seeing people(humans) as disgusting things that I want no part of. Don't get me wrong, I always treat my partners with respect and care that they deserve but it feels more of a programmed thing. Like a robot that's doing something because it knows what to do not because it wants to. When something bad happens, breakup or something, I move on fairly quick. It makes me feel emotionless. For example, the last girl I was with, we were together for two years and she cheated on me. Yes it hurt me, but I got over it in less than a month. It shocks me hearing that people take a while to move on. So when I look at myself, I always ask if something is wrong with me.

I am debating to go to therapy. I just don't know what's wrong with me if anything is really.

Thanks again everyone.",12Oct2019,2

70,"Okay, so something really weird happened last night/this morning that has me extremely concerned about the health of my brain. I'm posting this here in hopes that someone can give me insight into what might be going on inside my skull before I consult a medical professional, which I will almost certainly do as soon as possible.

I woke up in my girlfriend's bed this morning, which mildly surprised me because I didn't remember being at her place last night. When she woke up, I said ""I must have been super tired last night, because I don't remember going to bed.""

She asked me if I remembered the ""fried air"" conversation. I didn't. ""Fried air?"" What does that even mean? She said I was playing a game where I was making up goofy nonsense phrases, which she didn't seem to think was weird. She thought I was intentionally being funny.

Then she asked if I remembered having sex. Again, I didn't. I mean, how do you *forget* having sex?

I do remember using alcohol yesterday -- maybe a little more than I should have -- but nowhere near enough to black out. I asked my girlfriend if I seemed drunk, and she said I didn't. Maybe a little buzzed, she said, but my coordination and motor skills were well within ""mostly sober"" parameters.

So, it's a mystery, and it's a pretty scary one. What the hell happened to my brain last night? As far as I know, it's never happened before (although if it happened before on a night when I was alone, how would I even know?).",12Oct2019,3

72,"First of all, I'm not wanting to kill myself. I am just sick of caring.

As I write this, I'm in a coffee shop having just walked out of the house and driven away. 

My wife laid into me about something I said, even though she misinterpreted me and would not allow me to explain what I sayed. Instead I get talked over and berrated. My 6 year old then moans (borderline tantrum) because I told him to come of minecraft to have lunch. This was after I came home from the supermarket at 10:30am to find him playing on my xbox. (Because of where it is his mum had to have switched it on for him). 

I had been up with our kids from 6am, gone shopping at 9:15am (on my own as I do every saturady), then gone out to a separate supermarket to get bits that I couldn't get from the first one.

I seem to be the only one concerned about how quickly we go through money in the account. Any savings for Christmas have completely gone. I have my wife and 15yr old's birthdays at the start of November, both of whom EXPECT presents, despite me literally getting nothing from them for mine for the 3rd or 4th year in a row (not actually kidding)

I am very unhappy in my job however cannot leave as I am the only one working as my wife now attends college and I can not find a job  that pays the same due to lack of qualifications.

Pretty sure I'm suffering from depression (have seen a doc) and with worrying about money, my job, my son, trying to help my wife and support her and every other problem that seems to want to take a pop at me I just feel like ""why should I care?"".

75,"I have been dealing with depression for 7 years. There's seriously almost no counselor or psychologist or psychiatrist in my country who actually understand the job (just want to keep a light hope there is), they can't even distinguish between the terms. My mom brought me to this self-claimed psychiatrist once who was famous among the parents and she asked me all kinds of questions you normally see on depression tests. If I just started to smily wryly, she immediately jumped to conclusion that I agree to her and changed the question. My three sessions with her were like, I came in for several questions, she answered them herself, and I got my prescribed medication after 5 minutes.

None of those medications actually worked. And it costed a fortune. If my symptoms didn't decrease, the psychiatrist just gave me more medication, and more and more the following time, like 5 to 6 types. So I stopped going to the place.

Then I got my dog and she's like the sun to my dark world. I have depression, anxiety, anger-control problem, and my dog helps me to keep control of all of them.

Few weeks ago when my dog went outside for a walk, she got fleas and ticks from other dogs. I did take her to the vet and they gave me the medicine, but I cannot cuddle with her until she's done with all the small sources of virus unless I want all those creatures crawl onto me (like they actually did when I cheat on the 'no cuddling rule').

It's a must to not cuddle with my dog. But leaving her alone now make me feel more at fault and there are even more stuffs to self-blame. Like my dog keeps whining for cuddle time and I can only leave her be.

I've struggled with suicidal ideation/self harm ideation for the past few years and I've recently started self harming (cutting). I see a therapist every few weeks, but she doesn't know about the relapse of suicidal ideation and the self harming yet. I see her in a few days and I plan to talk to her about it. 

I've talked to my mom, my closest friends, and a boy I've gone on a couple dates with who was confused about why I seemed so sad. Each time I tell somebody about it, especially the suicidal ideation and the self harm, I regret it.

82,"So I’ve been taking Viibryd for several years now. If I even so much as miss a dose I get dizzy, brain zaps, bright flashes when I close my eyes and generally just feel bad and can’t function. Three days ago (Wednesday) I broke down and cried in my docs office for two hours and we decided my current meds aren’t doing anything for me. She had me drop the Viibryd and add Vraylar starting Thursday morning. Supposedly I should have minimal side effects since both target the same areas of the brain, Vraylar just targets more. 
Well here we are on Saturday morning and I feel terrible. I have all the withdrawal symptoms I listed above and basically feel like a pile of garbage. Thurs/Fri I was extremely nauseous and shaking like crazy every time I got even the slightest bit anxious (so basically all the time). The nausea seems to have passed, but I haven’t gotten out of bed yet so I’m not sure about the shaking. 
Now this is the really bad part. I work at a very small animal rescue, generally the only person available to cover if I have to call out is my manager. She’s on vacation until Thursday morning and I’m scheduled to work Monday-Friday. She said she’d work with me on moving around my shifts so I didn’t have to work Thur/Fri but I HAVE to be there the other three days.

83,"This  started after a crossing gate fell on my head, i most likely had a concussion, I didn’t lose consciousness but went to the ER and they did a ct. the ct scan showed  “prominence of the sulcus spaces” in other words, brain atrophy, not relayed to the injury. Keep in mind I’m only 19.  They said it was most likely an insignificant finding but still encouraged  me to go to a neurologist in case. I’ve been a heavy marijuana user and drinker so I attributed the atrophy to this, I was convinced they’d find something wrong with my brain related to the drug use anyways. 

However I brushed it all off, brain had no bleeding which was the biggest worry at the time so I proceeded my life normally. However about a couple weeks later I had a severe personality change. I became a hypochondriac, I developed ridiculous delusions about my health. In addition I began to have certain “compulsions” , like coughing for no reason, touching/ moving my neck in certain directions, and a lot of other absurd obsessions.  I have a lot of intrusive thoughts, mostly violent, also feel a lot of derealization; like I can just do something bizarre. It’s hard to describe. 

I then scheduled an appointment with a neurologist; before I told him about any of my symptoms,  he ordered a MRI of my brain, which is a far more superior scan compared to the CT.

When I came into discuss my MRI results he told me my brain looks healthy. He did say though my frontal lobe is a little smaller than the rest of my brain but said this might be a normal finding. I also told him about my symptoms in detail, he insisted it was not Dementia but a psychiatric issue.

Anyways, to sum it up I stopped smoking weed completely about 3 months ago. My personality remains unchanged. I’ve been drinking way less than I used too as well.  I’m really wondering of what is going on, I am not myself and haven’t been for the past 10 months.",12Oct2019,1

If someone is explaining a multi-step process to me, such as a new task that needs to get done at work, I’ll often forget or just kind of “tune out” the beginning or middle steps as they are explained to me. I will only digest the last few things that are said to me.

90,"Hi everyone,

I'm a guy who's 19, legally blind, and really struggling with anxiety. I have had anxiety for as long as I can remember as my father was abusive towards me, my mom, and my brothers and sisters. This abuse continued up until a few months after I turned 11. I'm not 100% certain if it is why I have anxiety, but I'd imagine that's part of it.

I tend to think a lot. Probably more than I should. Mostly about social interactions. But sometimes other details too. I live in a dorm, and absolutely hate the thought of leaving my room to go to the bathroom when someone else is in there for instance. So, sometimes I stay in my room for what feels like forever until they leave so that I have some form of privacy.

When I catch the bus in the morning with numerous other people, I worry about small details such as where I'm looking, what I'm looking at, whether or not I am going to start a conversation with the person next to me, and if I do want to start a conversation, I worry about what I will talk about, when to start the conversation... etc. And by the time I've thought of something, I often miss the chance to speak with them.

Now, you'd think this would carry into other aspects of my life such as organization, but my dorm room, by no means is organized. If anything, it is really disorganized and I often lack motivation to clean it up unless I'm doing laundry or things get too bad. I've always been jumbled in this aspect, and I've noticed this has carried over to my work a lot of the time. TAs have pointed it out to me so I usually take my jumbled mess that is my work, and rewrite all of it so that it is organized for other people to look over. But this process can take hours.

My essays, while they use high levels of grammar, are often hard for other people to follow. When I speak them aloud, I understand why. But at the point of writing them, they make perfect sense to me.

In terms of social interaction, I find it hard to look the person I'm speaking to in the face unless I know them well, and even if I do know them well, whether it be family or friends, I find it hard to speak with them.

Since coming to college, I've tried to speak with people more frequently. But I've failed in even that aspect. And when social interactions go downhill, I often begin grinding my teeth. For instance, if there's a group of people standing in the middle of a hallway, or some area that I need to walk, I often find myself doing this. When I'm stuck in larger crowds, I don't know what to do so I'll pull my phone out and act like I'm actually doing something when in all seriousness I am not.

I feel really uncomfortable around people I'm not familiar with unless someone that I do know is there. It's hard for me to schedule appointments, but I can get over the anxiety and force myself to when it really matters.

When writing emails to professors and TAs (which I do quite frequently), I think over the conversation much more than I should . I.E. I am thanking them enough, or did I word something correctly... etc.

I had a therapist for several months, but she pretty much just affirmed what I already knew so I quit going. For the record, I was diagnosed with a general anxiety disorder, but it feels much worse than that.

I really feel as though it is starting to inhibit other aspects of my life, and that I am starting to miss opportunities that I could of had, had I not been in the situation I am now. I feel as if people also avoid talking to me because I walk with a white cane and they figure my disability prohibits proper social facilitation for whatever reason, which I guess is understandable.

In addition to all of this, sometimes I feel unmotivated to do things. And I will waste time doing other things that are less important, or I will just sit in complete silence thinking (more often than not this is how my mornings go).

If anyone has any suggestions for how to tackle this, please let me know. I don't want to be in the situation I am in right now for the rest of my life.

Have a great weekend!",12Oct2019,1

92,"Hello, 

I'm 17 and I've been fighting with depression and anxiety for almost 7 years now. I also have ADHD.

I've had this problem for a long time: sometimes out of nowhere my emotions and anxiety get so bad, that I black out. Sortoff, I can't move my body and have no controll over it. I can vaguely hear what's happening around me, but it' somewhere in the distance. When this happens is completely random and it lasts from anywhere between 5-40 minutes. I've been experiencing these things for 2 years now. My doctor and therapists/psychtiatrists have no idea what this could be, cause they have never heard of something like this before. But the last 2 weeks it's been getting worse and I almost have them every other day now. (First it was maybe once or twice every 2 weeks.) I have no idea what this is. Or how to handle it. Cause I can barely life my life because of this.",12Oct2019,1
93,"Hey, I just realised that I’ve been throwing myself into this self-pity party and that it’s mostly just me escalating problems that weren’t even there in the first place. Well, actually, I’ve known this has existed since the dawn of time. I just didn’t properly address it because I’m in denial. My therapist told me that it’s mostly because of my paranoia, or from what little stuff he lets slip about myself since he’s more focused on me mending my relationship with my mom. 

He’s a really good therapist, I think.. But the pacing is a bit too slow for me. I wanted him to address a bunch of stuff, like my alleged anxiety and depression, my paranoia, and now, my declining memory. There are memories that I didn’t want to forget, most importantly, the memory of the puppy that followed me for 3 months while I was in university. Ask anyone that knew me or talked to me before and they can tell you that I mention this particular dog almost everyday and it annoys them sometimes. That’s the only way I can remember this dog and the memories I had with him. I have a photo on him on my phone cover so I can look at him every day. It’s been that bad. 

Recently, I’ve wanted to do a bunch of stuff. Bought an expensive microphone months ago because I wanted to sing and publish covers despite my shit voice, bought a midi keyboard because I wanted to produce music despite not having any knowledge in music theory or even know how to compose, recently bought a Korean vocabulary workbook because I wanted to learn Korean for seven fucking years but couldn’t because I’m just that fucking useless, the list goes on. 

So now I need help. Should I sell everything and just... Not do it or do I do something about all this and try to change myself for the better? I had a talk with my mom before and she said it’s all about the mindset. I know that, but how do you go from “I’m a fucking disgrace and should have been aborted when I was a fetus” to “I am loved, I know people around me thinks I’m enough and that’s enough for me”? I don’t care how long it takes, I just want to change. I can’t live like this anymore. I’m exhausted. Please help if you can because I’m running out of options and sick of wasting time.",12Oct2019,1
94,"In 2013 to 2014 I went through this brief period in year 7 here in the UK, where I was embarrassed and humiliated by a certain person on the school bus. This caused my attendance to drop down significantly with unauthorized absences and my step-dad (back then) would give me a fueled yelling but wouldn't understand. 

The rest of my time at that school, I was secluded. I didn't have ""real"" friends or people who wanted to hang out after school. I had maybe a few people who I'd talk to but that was that. I'm 19 now and I feel I've never ""fully"" recovered at least, or let's say I've developed certain problems that are altering my mental health.

I had a job interview yesterday that gave me reminiscent memories of that time where I was humiliated. I came back home and smothered my fists and elbow in to the wall until they bled (typing this post really slowly with a bandage over my right fist.) Yes, my fist hurts and I believe I have a severe mental problem.

I don't know if I have anger problems that are the result of the bullying because I felt powerless, out of control. I couldn't jump out the bus, no, I had to sit there everyday from and to the school as my parents both worked 9 to 5. Now when I have anything that momentarily puts me over the limit, I go from 0 to 100 very violently. 

My mom doesn't understand, she has this ""golden child"" image in her head of me which doesn't correlate with me at all. I have only maybe 2-3 friends that I talk to irl or through Facebook Messenger/Whatsapp but I don't think it'd be appropriate talking about mental health with them as we're not on the same page here. So now all I'm left is with the internet when I can spew my thoughts out. 

If you're going to tell me ""it's in the past, man up"" don't even bother, I've heard it all before and I've constantly tried to get that memory out but it's leaked out in to other parts of my psyche that might be needing therapy to fully make me in to the man I could be in the future. 

I'm also probably going to delete Reddit, social media is definitely not helping me at all and disconnecting myself with who I really am and could be. Instagram, Facebook and Twitter all gone. Reddit is next, hopefully.",12Oct2019,1

96,"Since like December, I start to have symptoms that recently made me think whether I'm bipolar or not.

It all started with depression, lack of interest in things I enjoyed previously (like music or video games), loss of good habits (like morning routine), changes in my eating/drinking patterns (started to eat a lot of sweet food and drink sweet drinks as often as possible) and hypochondria (I had a fear of three different cancers). I decided to go a psychiatrist for an explaination of my problems. After 3 appointments I've heard diagnosis. He ruled out neurosis. Between the visits, I used to take pills for bipolar disorder, because the psychiatrist thought I could be bipolar. After the 3rd appointment, I started to take SSRI. I always followed what the doctor said when it comes to taking it. In spring, I started to spend more money than usual (mostly for unnecessary junk food or drinks). Not taking loans or gambling though. I also started going to the gym, which I would later lost interest in for unclear reasons. In May (or June, I don't remember), I started to feel ""better"", yet hypochondria used to show up from time to time. I also started to act more childish and hyperactive along my uni friends. One of (then) friends thought I started doing drugs. I thought the childish behavior and hyperactivity was a side effect of SSRI. During my holidays (from July to September), my health anxiety was slowly fading away. Although, as soon as September started, I noticed suddenly higher interest in self-improvement (decided to eating less, working out again, getting into fashion, etc.), as well as sudden interest in cooking (started to make dishes in ways I wouldn't normally do). And then... I went back to uni and lost a friend due to return of childish behavior (posting strange stuff to her, stalking-like behaviors, acting as if I tried to pick her up in a silly way). She doesn't want to talk with me anymore. Currently (since like a week), I feel down again. Started to eat more again, spend more money and masturbate in a compulsive way. I also dropped interest in cooking and self-improvement. I also had my last visit to my psychiatrist this Tuesday and he said why he thought I could be bipolar a couple of months ago and why he thinks his diagnosis of neurosis could actually turn out to be bipolar disorder in the future. What doesn't help in my situation is that my parents are your typical ""Just get busy/Man up"" type of parents, which they won't really care that much about potential mental health problem symptoms. Through the whole journey, I also lost lots of my creativity, but I tend to have episodes when creativity is boosted out of nowhere.

98,"long story short: my anxiety has gotten unmanageable about a year and a half after being hired and its 100% affecting my work. do i tell my boss?


so, when i was hired a year and a half ago, my anxiety was pretty bad. but i was recovering from a really bad time with anxiety over germs. being at work helped speed up that recovery so i never really told my boss or anything. but now my anxiety is back with a vengeance. its not about germs any more, its a lot more vague and changes constantly, but it's so much worse than anything I'd experienced before. (im 99% sure its undiagnosed, severe OCD).  


the issue is it is very much affecting my ability to work. ill barely talk to customers bc of intrusive thoughts making me think I'll say something offensive, i sign off saying i did a task and I'll go back and check that i did 10 times, and theres certain things that i just avoid completely bc i know itll start me spiraling. 


Im worried that if i dont tell my boss (or maybe one of the bosses below him) that ill get fired, specifically for avoiding tasks and for spending so much time in the stockroom checking every thing that pops into my head.  But im also worried that if i do tell someone, they'll not take me seriously.

99,"My boyfriend is an 18-year-old male, we’ve been dating for a year now. We both go to the same college and live on campus so I get to see him every day and spending so much time with him has made me notice some things that I’m worried about. 
Well to start with, I know that he’s had previous episodes of depression. I didn’t know him before but he told me during his junior and senior year he had some really bad days where he literally couldn’t even get out of bed. At that time he was going through a lot of stress but eventually he just started getting better. He told me about this manic phases where he would be soooo energetic for many days, get things done, be extremely motivated and in need to be constantly getting something done, he would work so fast and get all his shit together in no time, but soon after he would fall into another phase of depression for several days where he wouldn’t get out of bed, he would just lay there and play video games or watch YouTube. When we first started dating, in our senior year, I realized that he was still having those mood swings, but since I would only see him a couple of hours per day it wouldn’t be as obvious and I just thought it was the normal adolescent phase, since I go through the same episodes of feeling down or feeling really happy. But now that I get to spend more real time with him I’ve noticed that this episodes are something else, they’re not normal and I’m worried about him.
I was once looking at his reddit profile trying to find a specific post and I came across a post he made a couple of years ago in r/bipolar and he was explaining everything I just explained and he was asking if he had bipolar disorder. That made me realized that he’s aware of his behavior and he knows is not something normal, so seeking for help, even if it’s in the internet, it’s a big step. But that was years ago. I know he used to go to therapy and I think it helped for a while but once he stopped going he went back to the same routine. 
It’s hard being around him sometimes, I love him and I want to always be there for him, but there’s some days where he just doesn’t want to do anything, and it hurts to see him just lay in bed all day, not wanting to go to his classes, to work, do his assignments or even go to clubs that he signed up for. I feel powerless, like no matter what I say or do it’s just not helping him. The last week he’s been doing pretty good, but I don’t know how to approach him with this topic. I think he should get some professional help but i know this Is a really sensitive topic for him and I don’t know how to bring it up without making things worse.

102,"We have had next to no contact in months. We used to be really close untill she came into the picture. Both single parents.. 

I never really got along with his gf. She was very controlling and dominant from 3 weeks in and I didn't like it. She didn't like us being close and even at one point insinuated there was something off with our relationship. 

That lead me to some drunken stupid texts. Before I was diagnosed and got some medication, I was using alcohol to deal with my anxiety. Bulimia as well.

I admit I was a bit obsessed with their relationship. But I felt like she was trying to split up my family. 

My brother has a daughter(7years old) and we are very close. I never did anything fucked up in front of her.  But they are trying to keep us apart. When I see her at school she jumps in my arms and tells me how much she misses me. If my brothers gf is there, she pulls her away from me. It breaks my heart. 

Just now she is with my parents and sent me a text saying she loves me with all her heart and it's me and her forever. I melted. I love her so much.

I used to love my brother very much too, but I have lost respect for him. She is controlling his every move. At one point we were finally alone on the balcony I sat him down and asked him if he was ok because she seemed a bit dominating. He said yes. Turns out she was listening by the window. Since then I havent been welcome in their house. 

I have acted like an idiot in the past but it all had to do with my mental health. Now it just seems they have given up on me. What should I do? Just accept this? I don't even know how Christmas is going to play out and for the first time in my life I'm not looking forward to it.",12Oct2019,1

So last month I've gone through a breakup that was basically out of nowhere, which was kind of a massive delusion, but generally I try to stay positive and did what I could to entertain myself, like hanging out with friends etc. I was prescribed xanax for one week to deal with my anxiety but had the absolute douche idea to stop after four days, then obviously had a relapse and took it again for a couple of days. Immediately after that episode I tried to get into art school, and at the exam this guy from the committee hated my work for some reason, and was overrall extremely rude to me. I got in anyway to my surprise however my self esteem had already been crushed all over again.

118,"There are things I would’ve never actually admitted to. One of those things,  however, is a possibility that I’ve contemplated and eventually learned  to deal with! It’s something I never imagined myself revealing to  everybody I knew, though I managed to change my own mindset to feel  comfortable in revealing what I am about to.  
People may assume I’m a  mildly disgusting or shitty person for doing it, though when I was  younger I used to avoid looking at my schizophrenic relative because I  thought we had particular things, or traits in common. Every time I saw  him walk by, I’d immediately turn my head around. Or, every time  anything came out of his mouth, I’d grab my pair of headsets and play  some of the music on Spotify. It was an obviously unhealthy form of  escapism that I began to feel guilty about.

(It may not seem like a big deal to some people, though I avoided things on a gross level!)

Around  the last months proceeding 11th grade (or earlier during 12th grade) I  began to realize things related to me didn’t quite add up, and due to my  fear I used to research things that supported my current medical diagnosis of higher functioning autism. As time went by specific things related to me felt wronger and wronger to the point where I could no  longer avoid the possibility of being a mildly psychotic person. Being somebody who typically enjoyed researching mental disorders and  psychological illnesses I already knew there were aspects of those  things most people were highly unaware of, and that you didn’t literally  need to hallucinate to actually be considered schizo-\*inserts any  type\*.

Throughout my childhood I  grew up with rather blunt facial expressions, social problems and did weird things that  are typically associated with mentally ill people. I understand half of the things on my mind could also be a result of my current diagnosis,  HFA/ASD. However, considering some of my relatives have an entirely different mental disorder (aka, the **other one**), it shouldn't necessarily just be a coincidence!

Starting off as a narrow-minded avoidant individual in regards to the topic seems like something that goes outside of my typical character, though I did it for an understandable reason. During high school I became overly obsessed with my diagnosis because I wanted everybody to understand me.  I’ve blasted social media with hints related to having it, which was such a huge deal to me. The truth is that I wasn’t actually with my mom  while she was describing my own symptoms. Don’t take this the wrong way,  because I actually have visited psychiatrists with my mom in the past around the same time. Though during the **exact time** of my official diagnosis, I wasn’t there! I used to plug my ears a lot,  not because things were too loud to handle, though because things in  general typically disturbed my own internal fantasies. If you want me to  make a statement to basically sum it all…. I don’t actually feel  autistic (regardless of whether it's actually true or not). My mom basically just told them things she didn't have the answer to, or know the motive of.  
Childhood onset schizophrenia is rare, which was actually used in my own bias back in the day when I lied to myself. Though it makes a lot of genetic sense because my father is psychotic!  


When  it comes to supposed facts about myself, I feel like I’m often times  being plagued by wrongness, and it bothers me more than some people may  think. I always believe I’m characteristically more similar to schizophrenic people (not to mention I actually know some online and a few in person), and it’s easy to assume that when I’m always imagining my character through an observer’s perspective. It gives me a grasp of what my overall vibe aligns with the most!  As I said, there's  still a possibility that my current diagnosis is correct. However, it feels wrong the more I imagine things related to myself.

As I already mentioned in the beginning, I'm **WAYYY** more comfortable revealing it and bringing it up than I used to be (even if the perception pisses me off).

119,"i’m constantly overthinking everything all the time. i ask myself if i’m happy on a daily basis and psychoanalyze why i am or why i am not. i know that my ego is falling to pieces because anyone can convince me they’re smarter than me (i value other people’s opinions over my own). i’m genuinely terrified my life will be like this forever. i let little things affect me, such a friend who cut me off this week (and isn’t explaining why) caused my heart rate to increase dramatically and it made me feel sick. 

i think i need therapy but i don’t want to recognize there’s a problem. and i worry that therapy will make me overthink the problem far too much (if it works). at the same time i don’t know if therapy will work because i can’t open up all of this to a therapist, and it’s also so difficult to get access to regular therapy that i’d probably have to wait a few months anyway. i just want to be okay and happy RIGHT NOW. live a life where the deepest thoughts i have are “this person is good looking” and not analyze every detail of why i find them attractive and then attack myself for what and how i feel. where i’m not constantly trying to find a meaning and a pattern in the world. i’m not a philosopher, it’s not what i need to do. i want to do concrete things and JUST STOP THINKING.

i’m not suicidal in the slightest i just feel like spending 24/7 in my head is such a pointless way to spend my life. i have so many goals, i have so much to study, i haven’t found my passion yet but i’m looking for it. but somehow, i find myself scrolling through instagram and facebook reading about people’s lives that i’m not all that interested in. i want my motivation to come back. i’m so distracted by small things, and feel so insecure in my social standing that i say yes every time someone invites me &amp; have basically barely studied at all because i’m either with others or on my phone wasting time. i just want to DO stuff but somehow, i can’t. 

i talk about myself so much and i want to stop talking about myself. i forgive everyone who did problematic stuff, surround myself with objectively toxic people, yet i’ve been forgiving them because i refuse to believe anyone can truly be a bad person. i can’t hold a grudge even when people don’t deserve it. i blame myself because it is honestly easier than accepting that other people are bad. i need to value myself more and my own opinions but i don’t know how to do that. i just want to be studying and doing things i like, not thinking about any of this at all. especially if there are no triggers as to why.",12Oct2019,2

121,"One of my best friends recently did a mental health 180. Just a few months ago she was doing so well. She lived with the reality of depression and anxiety like myself, but she was working hard to keep pushing through life despite those hurdles. 

She lost track around her birthday earlier this year. Her birthday triggers memories of traumatic events from the past, but this year it sent her back down a particularly dark path. As time has gone on she not only started to disassociate, she stopped working toward improving her life (she's been looking for a new job). She rarely texts me back now, and has not asked to hang out in a few weeks.

A few weeks ago, she told me she has a plan to end her life after some personal things are taken care of. But she intends to do it in a few years, not soon.

I'm losing hope fast but I refuse to give up on her. She doesn't have many close people in her life and is used to people leaving her. I will not be one of those people.

I am struggling with how best to give her space while reminding her know that I will not abandon her like she expects me to. I send her a meme every few days because I know it makes her laugh. I don't expect a reply, I only want to remind her that I care.

She knows what it's like to be better. She's been there before. I want her to see it again. I just don't know what I can do without being pushy or invasive.",12Oct2019,9

I’m noticing at this point in my life that I care way too much about what people think of me. It feels like a character flaw that will never go away. Why do I care so much? I often have dreams about it. I know that as I person I have a tendency to overshare, speak loudly, and go out of my way to please others. Is there anyone else that does this?

124,"*lmao realised how mumble jumble this shit is but feel free to read i guess ha*
So I have been so in my head since for the past month and unable to do much, like I just feel so lost and uninspired. And when I do get some motivation everything just goes wrong in every way possible (everything will suddenly go missing, my art won’t go how I want it etc, or I’ll get mad ill). Like I was hoping to sort my life out for the last year of sixth form this year during the summer but I got so ill instead that when I got back to school I just got beefed by everyone because no one believes what I say, EVER! This resulted in a mental breakdown in front of my tutor and friends about how no one ever believes me and I really tried to do work but I couldn’t. This resulted in my school trying to give me counselling but I don’t think it would work because I wouldn’t know what to say so here I am. Everytime i try to do the right thing I fuck it up. It’s not even like I was getting black out drunk every weekend during the summer or anything which is what everyone thinks. I even got myself a job now which everyone seemed to think I wouldn’t be able to do. It’s just the fact everyone expects me to get all A’s in my a levels like I got CBB last year when I wasn’t even wanting to and they still act like it ain’t even good enough, now because i cried they are acting as if it’s amazing like ??? Am I dumb enough to fall for that? Idgi. And I just get distracted by everything like I go to school purely to see my friends because apart from that I am just distracted and can’t work but now the school is forcing me to come in, I think the fact I don’t have a social life like before because I have no money atm and for the whole summer has contributed because my happiness is by purely living will thrill, excitement and friends to be around, like if I went two days without seeing my friends I would get SO sad. I didn’t even have to be close to people, and then I just am too open with everyone. Guess that’s why everyone thinks I’m some crackhead at school. And honestly I’m sensing PTSD vibes from when I had a during the summer and had a horrid trip / roll or whatever and felt like i was dying because since then I’ve had flashbacks and bad anxiety every night or randomly since then, but no one believes that I nearly did die like I genuinely like you know when you nearly die and you just kinda give up and accept it (it happened another time when I nearly drowned so at least i get me). Like fully everyone thinks it’s just laughs when I get bad on drugs, like oh she’s such a funny crackhead look at her have a bad one again because like I get bad more than everyone else. Like yeah it’s giggles for me too but not when no one listens to u. Honestly feel like my life has gone so stale I’ve been quite sober ( I’m honestly making it seem like I’m some massive crackhead all I did last year was like a pill every few months, tiniest bit of coke, and drink most weekends) but yeah I’ve been more sober than I have been last year, I’ve had a vodka and coke since the end of August that’s it because I can’t afford to go out. Like I just wanna have a crazy fun exciting life and if I don’t have that thrill I just get so sad, like thrill is what keeps me alive I guess not saying I’m gonna off myself lol.  I don’t even know what I have wrote at this point I kinda just let my mind go on a mad one",12Oct2019,2
125,"So basically this girl I've loved for almost 7 years asked me out on September 18th and we was having a good time, or atleast I thought until October 10th when she tried to kill herself... she told me the morning after and we hugged for about 20 minutes. And she told me everything about her mental health issues from the past 5ish years. About how she list her virginity at 12 because she didn't think she'd last much longer and wanted to experience it. To her ex boyfriend who was psychopathic and became a rapist about 2 months ago. She told me that it had nothing to do with me and cried into my arms and then tried to break up with me because ""she doesn't want to put me through all of this"" but I managed to sway her from it because I said ""I'll love you no matter what"" and we hugged for a while longer

The only problem is that since she attempted suicide her phone got taken and shes been sent away so I have no way of contacting her and I'm freaking out because I dont know when she can come back or atleast when she can get her phone back and its eating me up because I was the only one she told about the attempt and told everyone else she was just going away minus the fucking suicide attempt...

126,"I have never been diagnosed with anything, and since I was one of those girls in hs who glamorized mental illnesses, I've always felt like I was faking it. I've also recently stopped seeing me therapist because i felt like we werent actually going anywhere (shes a drug therapist, my problem isnt drugs). 

Anyway, I've always had a bad self image and have been awful at taking care of my body because of that. When i was a teenager, i suffered from an eating disorder. Wont say anorexia, cause it wasnt diagnosed, but something. Of course, was an over achiever with cutting as well. All of this has stopped though, as i enjoy food and almost have all my scars covered with tattoos. However, my body still sucks.

I can do normal stuff, it doesnt stop me from working. And i shower normally. I just never style/take care of my hair other than washing it (its curly, and needs a lot of care), i always forgot to put on deodorant, and sporadically brush my teeth for about a week every month before it just seems like too much and I ignore it. Until something happens, like someone making a remark or, like what just happened, a piece falls off. I am super self conscious and want to find help, but am terrified of actually admitting something is wrong IRL. I know the root of my problems (childhood stuff, whatever) but I dont know how to stop the symptoms. 

It's not like I can just feel better about myself, or just take care of myself. I do good for a bit, then honestly forget, and when I remember I feel so ashamed that I just ignore it. Please help.",12Oct2019,2

130,"Summary

Subjet Name Junior(it's my middle but whatever), 23yo man, living alone, economycally independent, professional cooker(althoug i don't cook as much as i want to) borned with a genetic desease, Juvenile Gout aka Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or kelley-seegmiller syndrome(I actually don't know witch of those two i have but i definitely have gout), been suffering with arthritis since age 15, been dealing with depresion for almost 10 years

A little bit of context

I was borned in Venezuela, in 2016 due to the crisis hitting the country i decided to leave and move to Colombia, my parents knew of this and they didn't oppose, emigrate entering to Colombia by border region, nothing illegal jtbc, only stayed there for like 2 weeks and then i leave, i ran out of money and couldn't find anything to make money, so i call back home, they send me money and i returned. 

That experience help me to mature a lot, i was a very shy child, your typicall cry under mom's skirt child, i decided to ""cry"" back home, my parents where fully comprehensive, they send me the money to my debit card and then payed my trip back home, by bus, something i'll ever remember about that trip was sawing a like 10 crack addicts with very run out clothes fighting over a pipe on plane sight for everyone at like 9am near an bus terminal, then returning to the place i was staying in, looking my reflection on one of the mirrors and sawing myself as one of them(i was very skinny at that time, i wasn't malnurish but i was a bit underweight) that fucking terrified me, in that time i was suffering some kind of celiac reaction due to stress(?) so i couldn't eat yunk food from the street, wich contribuyed to me being skinny, i arrive home, and since the second week i knew that i couldn't live on Venezuela anymore, i couldn't stand it anymore, fastforward 6 months, i started to save money, i started legalizing my papers, birth certificate, grades, evything i knew that could be handy on the exterior bc's i knew next time i leave was it for good, mid november i finished legalizing everything, on december i decided that it was enough, and then on the 17th of december i leave home again, coudln't even spend the last xmass with my family, but deep inside i knew that if i leave on that period of time, something will happen on the country, the government will close the borders or something like that(wich i was right about bcs the government do close the borders), on december 19th at 6am i arrive to the border, the started to look for somebody so i could exchange currencies, it took me a while, bcs you have a lot of ppl offering the ""service"" and i wanted to lose the least amount of money possible, at 6pm i crossed the border into brazil with 110 Real, i knew it wast'n much but that's all i got, at 10 pm i was on Boa vista with 50Real, i didn't have any direction to stay on Boa vista, so the cap rider let me near a public plaza where was a lot of others venezuelans, they welcome me, then i asked if they knew about some cheap place to spend the night in, those that only rent for one day ""uma diaria"" 2 guys stand out and tell me that they knew a place but due to the hour that wouldn't be possible, then they told me that a lot of them where sleeping together on a little concert stage at the of the plaza, like 15+ ppl and i was like ok, if that's the only option, so i spend the night on that stage, and there started my life as a migrant. 

(My life as a homeless it's something i could touch on another post, i spend 7 months living as a homeless man)

Now the main thing

I've been on another state for the last year, i've been exploited 2 times total, one while i was homeless on boa vista and the second one when i arrived here where i am right now, the firts time i leave the ""job"" i haved due to healt complications, sciatic pain due to handling with heavy stuff for long periods of time, and have arthritis didn't help much with that.

The second time i ""leave"" bcs i have constants fight with the guy that i was working for, as a cooker, working monday to monday from 5am to 7pm, for only half of the minimun wage, i could have denounce him for having workers on slave like conditions wich is 100% a thing here on brazil, but i didnt do it bcs i was terrified of the repercussion, living alone on a city where i don't know anything and knowing that he have contacts, so i keep my mouth shout and started looking for job on the city.

The firts 2 months i didn't fing anything, and i was starting to ran out of money, i was on a whatsapp group of ppl seeking jobs, then i burts and explain my situation, Mike invite me over to his church to he and the other ppl in the church could help me, Near to end of november one of the sister from the church take me to an language school here on the city, where i presented myself to the region manager, the look interested in my but for the most part was to beeing and native spanish speaker, i started assisting some meetings to knew about how the system works and what not, then on february i both got my firts student, i only work as a vip teacher there, and started working for one of the brother from the church on a precook pizza place(Side note, Pizza here on brazil it's a totally different thing from what ppl it's used to internationally)

I only worked there 1 month, in the evening/night while attending the school in the morning, only work on the pizza place due to one of the gals from there being off vacation, when she returned i had to leave, in that period of time in wich i was working on the pizza place, i moved nearby it, then when i leave the pizza place, one of my neighbours told me about how she is friend of the owner of a restaurant chain here on the city, great i schedule a meeting with the owner, and wonders i get the job as a chef applicant, i was working like a sous chef, but there was a chance so i could became the chef, that was the deal that we make bcs althoug i studied gastronomy i didn't knew much about the food of this region, so fine, i started working formally the next day.

In this period of time my healt state was a bit low due to having to work simultaneosly in the day and night, and i needed to save the must i could on spendings so i was going on foot averywhere here, i remember feeling a lot of pain just by walking to got to work, my knees are weak and so is my hip and low back regio.

Working on the new restaurant was a great experience, i didn't even remember the last time i were on a real restaurant kitchen, but sells weren't so good, and then after 1 1/2 month  i got dismissed, they do pay me everything.

Then there was i, on a place i couldn't pay anymore, almost jobless, sick, and the most hurtfull thing of all, alone, really fucking far away from my family, my childhood friends and everyone that could give a shit about my situation and give me a well needed hug, and i mean a real hug, not a ""poor thing, look at him alone in the world struggling all by himself"" kinda hug, i do speak with my family everyday thou, on whatsapp, or chat apps, but is not the same, is not the fucking same, there's nothing like having your dear ones nearby you.

After been dismised i talk with my neighbour again and she talk me about where she works the company was looking for someone to deliver advertising around the city, and i say ok, hit me up, it's more like a side job, is not every day but it's something, but i have to leave my place bcs i couldn't afford it anymore.

So i decided to move in with a sister from the church whose economical situation wasn't at is best, we tryed out for a month, but i was almost breaking even, and on the next month she started to treat me different, and then one day she told me that her family was againt us sharing a room bcs shes from the church and how could come of she sharing a room with somebody that she barely knows, and bla bla bla.

So i was like fuck! i'll have to leave from here to and i'm almost without money for a new place, i find a really cheap place and move out, the same day when i was about to leave i pass by a restaurant i've been passing for the last months asking about job and that day the owner told me that he could leave me work on fridays, so i move out, and started living alone again.

On another note, while living with this woman i lose my only pair of contact glasses, and i was like htf am i supossed to look for a job without been able to see properly.

While on the new place my family manage to send me a little bit of money, which is really difficult and it bothers me bcs they still live on that shit hole, i manage to buy some food and save a little bit because i needed to buy the glasses.

While living in this new place i've been on my lowest low, wondering if any of these it's worth continuing, i've been through a lot of shit, i barely break even every month, i did buy my glasses.

Also while i was working on the restaurant i meet a guy that let me help him on a produce stand he has on a market on weekends a strength demanding job because we need to load and unload the merchandise, today i left bcs i couldn't bear with it anymore, the pain on the back and knees it's killing me, when i was heading home some random guy hold me at gun point and stole my fucking cellphone, i didnt have any money on me, and at least i didn't lose both some money and the cellphone, so today my situation got from worse to even worse.

I can't find a proper job due to my health issues, living with arthritis is really tiring and painful, and on top of that i live here, alone.

I feel hopeless everyday, like all i'm doing it's in vain.

When the drepesion wave hits, hits really hard. 

I really don't know what to do anymore...",12Oct2019,1

He keeps assuring that it isn't the case and he never showed any signs of displeasure yet all those thoughts keep pushing me and sometimes i believe in them that much to the point whatever he says goes one ear in and the other ear out.

He knows about my conditions and all because i told him everything to make sure he won't regret his decision of being with me.
But i just don't know, i just feel so goddamn afraid of losing him or that he's plotting something with someone else to actually hurt me.

134,"Hey guys... I definitely need some help. (TW For a list of the self-injurious things I did in my fit below.)

For clarification, I just got done with having another mental break, after having constant throbbing headaches for a couple weeks because of stress over school. (I've been cramming for various weekly tests back to back with no break for around a month and a half now.)

What triggered the break was that my mom, after asking me why I'm having difficulty studying, said multiple times that I'm ""just not trying,"" and ""just don't want to learn this stuff,"" when I asked for a break from studying. This was especially insulting because I have severe ADHD, which has made school very difficult my whole life, and every time she has said this in the past, I have asked her not to say that anymore and patiently explained that I am trying, and I do want to learn- despite what she may think.

This time, I just went off the rails.

It's like my brain was being cooked inside my skull in a vat of rage. I started off by screaming as high-pitched and loud as I could get. My mom then tried to diffuse the situation by laughing it off, to absolutely no effect- it's like she was speaking another language. I then started growling random obscenities, and and hollering something vague about how hard I've been trying. This, likewise, had absolutely no effect on her but to make her yell at me harder about what a little shit I was being. I screamed again, and she started mocking me and saying, ""see? You're not the only one who can throw a tantrum!"" She told me to go to my room, and I did, where I screamed more, cried, hyperventilated, and paced for a half an hour, stabbed myself in the thighs over and over with a push-pin, cut little slits in my arm with a nail clipper, cut one of my legs with scissors, bashed my forearms on every hard surface I could find (including my other limbs), drank hand sanitizer, drank mouthwash, cut my nails off with scissors, filed them down to raw stubs with a nail filer, and rubbed the underside of my left wrist so raw with my fingers that it's still swollen, stinging, and oozing. I was, at one point during this fit, going to jump out of my bathroom window and kill myself (my room is on the second floor), but then I remembered that I haven't finished Fallout: New Vegas yet, so I decided not to. I have gotten very good at talking myself out of suicide, even when I'm not in my right mind.

Don't ask me why I drank hand sanitizer and mouthwash, I don't rightly know, and I was definitely not in my right mind while I was doing it. All I know is that I wasn't doing it for the alcohol, only to, in some way, hurt myself.

It has been about an hour, maybe and hour and a half, and now I am writing you this post. I haven't confronted my mom yet, and I'm sitting in bed, feeling numb and apathetic. I haven't gotten one of these weird mental episodes in years and years (last one being around sophomore year of highschool), but now that I'm taking more rigorous college classes, it seems like I almost snap and go berserk a couple times a week.

Can anyone out there tell me what is wrong with me? Can you tell me how to fix it, or how to avoid this happening in the first place?

141,"Since a couple of weeks I noticed that I started to feel a little bit down, with a busy period on work making long days. Coming home feeling absolutely empty. Not wanting to do anything in the weekends or the evening. Even my girlfriend not able to cheer me up. At this point my work ethic is gone, I'm less excited to see my girlfriend or friends and I just wanna lay in bed watching movies.

I thought I was overworked. I took an holiday but even in the holiday I wasn't enjoying myself and just wanted to go home and again, lay in bed all day. 

It's not that I hate myself or my life or anything. I like my job, love my girlfriend and my friends. I just can't get myself to be useful these days.

Do I have a depression or do I just need longer time off? What can I do to improve my mood?",12Oct2019,1

(Tw/ Obsession/ Suicide mention) 

My best friend saved my life multiple times, he stopped me from killing myself and stayed with me through all of my trauma (abuse and addictions, thinking i was going to be killed) not fun stuff.

Even though i harassed him and was manipulative when i had my psychotic breakdowns, he still stays with me and says that he loves me. I have a crush on him. I told him this and he was okay with it but has a girlfriend, so were still friends. Ive stole some of his stuff from his house, (hoodie, id, other small things) and i honestly dont know what to do. We have a healthy relationship now but i cant stop thinking about it. Hes all i have. I want to be close to him, not romantically but not platonically either. Somewhere in the middle. I dont know what to do anymore. I have multiple mental illnesses and i am on 20 Mgs of prozac. Hes busy most days but he makes time for me most days. Please send advice",12Oct2019,1
143,"Hey guys. The thing that pushes me over the edge the most is when people cancel plans. For context I am quite a recluse and am socially deprived as I dont really have any friends.

 A friend had some weed ordered and had me under the impression we were gonna smoke at the weekend, and I was really looking forward to it. I asked him if he was still planning on coming over at the weekend the other day and he just said no. Further questioning as to why not just led to blunt, and dicky replies consisting of ""no"" with no explanation. 

Had he explained, I would have been fine but since he had to be a dick about it, it pushed me over the edge and triggered a series of thoughts of rejection, loneliness, unwantedness etc, which triggered some very intense emotion.

 To start with it was rage, and I punched up some shit in my house and my face went all tingly. I was pacing back and forth and hyperventilating. After the rage subsided it turned into intense sadness and hopelessness. I slashed my arm up and sobbed for a while. Eventually I calmed down and went to bed. I was so ashamed the next day that I self harmed and went so crazy, but I just totally lost control.

This isnt the first time this exact scenario has happened. It wasnt the particular event that caused it all, but the rejection that triggered the thought process leading to the episode. 

I am incredibly sensitive to being let down or rejected and if any of you guys can relate I'd like to hear your thoughts.",12Oct2019,49

145,"dfab, 24, queer. professionally diagnosed with anxiety &amp; depression, self diagnosed ADHD (doctors wont take me seriously and i have shitty insurance), probably CPTSD because of being neglected &amp; abused as a child. 

in high school i became obsessed with my boyfriends sister in a very competitive way. we both struggled with self harm and eating disorders around the same time and would be there for each other in hard times. i felt very competitive and wanted to be skinnier and prettier. unsurprisingly we didn’t stay friends and still dont get along, 7 years later. still to this day, i check on her facebook sometimes through my now-husband’s facebook (she deleted me as a friend a few years ago). i get jealous when she posts about losing weight or being happy. a few times a month i will look at her blog she doesn’t know i have the url of... i look for an instagram account sometimes to see if she made one but havent had luck so far. i can’t really think of a reason i do this, after so long of not being friends or interacting. 

the second person i became obsessed with is my friend i made through a social media website. we both liked the same band and eventually got really close. things turned romantic a few years later (with the approval of my husband). things didnt work out in the end (surprise surprise) but i still check her socials a few times a week. i am so hurt that she’s fine and happy without me and it hurts me to look at her profiles but i do it anyway. ive done that since we became close friends, always checking up on her accounts. she’s a lot more attractive than i am and i also feel mildly competitive towards her. 

i just want to stop being obsessed with them. i feel like i have no self control and i just want to stop caring. i went months without checking the first person’s socials but eventually came back to doing it regularly. 

there are a few people ive met through life that i feel like could turn into obsessions but i try to keep myself from doing so because i know its not healthy or useful or right. i just dont know why i have these compulsions.

what causes these pointless obsessions?",12Oct2019,1
146,"So basically my brain (I refer to the collection of thoughts I can't control, and don't instigate, as my brain) every now and again singles out a person to lightly obsess over, not in a sexual way (I'm ace, so I don't do much in a sexual way), just a ""I really want to be your friend"" way, although it typically is a girl (I'm a guy, so I mainly try to avoid being creepy then have anxiety later analysing and struggling to remember the details and work out if I was accidentally creepy). I really want to work out how to deal with this better (it normally lasts a few weeks at minimum) and a side not that floated through my head as I wrote this and that I'm now feeling I really need to say, even though it isn't relevant is that the reason I like my three legged cat is because he'd be so much harder to replace. Like as a kid I was always scared when we sent the dog off to the kennels that she would be replaced with another dog that looked similar.  
I am going to talk to my doctor soon (I can't remember exactly when but next week), but if anyone can help me please do give some suggestions, the anxiety and distractions are really starting to affect my uni work and life.

152,"Okay so a bit of backstory. I (20yo male) used to be bullied a lot in school, because of aspergers and a muscular disfunction. This lasted from about the age of 6 to the age of 16. It got so bad, that the memories now hurt me, and a little less than a year ago I was told I have PTSD because of the bullying. I was told this by a psychologist who I was seeing because I felt horrible.

Not long after this moment, I almost jumped in front of a car. I would have, if a guy hadn't asked what I was doing at the side of the road. I got cold feet, and backed out, saying I wasnt doing anything, and I rode off on my bike. A couple of weeks later, I tried again, this time riding my bike into oncoming traffic, where a car only barely stopped in time to not hit me. It was inches away.

I was declared unstable, and went into a bit heavier treatment at the psychologist. I started having heavy panic attacks, which sometimes ended in me cutting myself. This lasted for about 5 months of visiting her twice a week and taking antidepressants, and I started feeling better. I was deemed stable again, and felt better. Even the panic attacks stopped happening.

This was until two weeks ago. My bad thoughts are returning, I'm having panic attacks again and Im feeling horrible. I'm terrified that I'm going to do something stupid, and I don't know what to do about it all. I am still going to the psychologist, but it just feels to me like I'm back at square one.",12Oct2019,0

so. im finally at a point in life where i'm semi-happy with myself. i got into my dream school, cut ties with toxic friends and got some new ones, finally developed a healthy close relationship with another person. to sum it up, i think i'm on the right path.  


however, i started getting these weird dreams. just flashbacks of memories i forgot i had playing back in my head as i sleep, making me weak up in a cold sweat and scared. they're mostly memories of my past abuse and such, with nothing added. just those events haunting me in my sleep.  


does anyone know why this happens? i'm slowly growing more and more exhausted as i lose sleep and find myself dwelling on past issues for no reason. should i see someone about this?",12Oct2019,1
154,"My brother recently went through a breakup about a few weeks ago and she was a manipulative horrible person. To sum her up, she was obsessive, checked in on him, timed him while he was doing tasks such as in the gym, accusing him of being with girls and what not etc. Granted I only know his side of the story I knew of the girl beforehand and she causes nothing but trouble. 

Anyway, after they split up I think they both took it pretty bad. My brother looked ok on the outside but didn’t have a clue what was going on in his head. Anyway tonight must have been the last straw for him. He told my mum everything, he’s struggling really bad.

His exact words were “I don’t wanna be here anymore, there’s no light at the end of the tunnel. I’m done”. Now this has me and my mum extremely worried. He went for a walk an hour ago and come back took his car keys and went out again. We was obviously scared and worried for him but he came back crying and that’s when I heard them words come from him. My mum is terrified. I don’t think he would do anything such as hurt himself but I do worry that he will cause trouble and so something which will land him in it. 

As I was typing this I have an update below.

I have just dropped my brother and mum off at the hospital, I have no idea what they will do for him if at all anything. But he acknowledges he needs help which is a start I guess. My mum has mentioned anti depressants which I’m not a big fan off just swallowing pills to try and fix things, but I know they can work. I’d rather try therapy first. But that’s just me and my opinion. 
Nothing like this has ever happened to us as a family before with one of us talking about depression etc before so we have no idea what to do!?

Any idea what we can do to help him, he said everything he enjoys to do he now hates.
I’d appreciate any help!
Thank you!!",12Oct2019,3
155,"I don’t know who to ask this. I don’t feel comfortable telling my therapist because they might get the wrong idea.

I know I’m not depressed. I’ve been depressed in the past and this feels a lot different. 

I am in a depressed mode most of the time though because of “triggers.” I’m not like, offended by things or that sensitive, but I’ve been through some trauma(mental trauma?) and I get triggered by *many* things, even my own thoughts in my own room. So it’s just a constant stream of my thoughts hurting myself and I can’t stop it. A lot of the time it makes me feel suicidal. Actually, I’ve been feeling more suicidal than I ever did when I had depression.

I remember when I had depression, I would just not feel anything. But now, it’s like I constantly feel like a hole is burning through my chest anytime I have these traumatic thoughts. I’ll cry at least 3 times a day out of the blue because the thoughts come on so strong.

“I’m not supposed to be here.”

“I was a mistake.”

“I shouldn’t look like this.”

“This isn’t my personality.”

“It wouldn’t be this way if…”

“I’m not who I am.”

And all of it is so strong that it impairs my functioning like depression did, which is why I feel like I’m sort of covering it up under the disguise of depression. I feel like a therapist wouldn’t take me seriously if I said I wasn’t depressed or they wouldn’t give me the support I need. 


Idk if it’s worth it to mention but my trauma heavily relates to my adoption, even though I was adopted as a baby. And that might seem kind of specific, but I want to clarify that my adoption ties into every aspect of my life so there’s a lot of things revolving around that, that are traumatic for me even if it has nothing to do with adoption at all.

I guess I’m just confused on what I’m dealing with. Trauma? Abandonment issues? Anxiety? Depression? Body Dysmorphia? Anger issues?

I have symptoms of a lot of these things that all stem from adoption. And now that I’m older, it’s hitting me like a fucking brick from every angle.",12Oct2019,1
