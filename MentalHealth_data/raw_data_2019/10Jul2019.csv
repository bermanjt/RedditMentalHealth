2,"So basically I take Zoloft 75mg everyday and I ran out a week and a half ago. I forgot to tell my doc i ran out when i saw her a week ago but now its too late. Then i realized she was on vacation so i couldn’t see her for a couple of days. Then there was canada day which meant that basically all stores and doctor offices were closed. THEN I was out of town for a few days because i was at my sisters camp. Before all of these unfortunate events happened, I went to my pharmacy to ask if i could get extra pills before i see my doc because i forgot i ran out of them. So now, it is highly unlikely i will be able to get more pills from the pharmacy without a referral from my doc. I also moved places so I’m at a different pharmacy now and they won’t refill until I see my doc. I’ve been off zoloft for well over a week and with no withdrawals, I’m just afraid that I’ll have to start the medication all over again due to my brain not having it in its system. Is that the case then? I was taking it for a month.",10Jul2019,2

4,"I think I just need to chat a bit and find some community. I have felt overwhelmed more often than not as of late, and while counselors and friends help, maybe someone here will find this relate-able. I hope so anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have many positive childhood memories. I have many negative ones, but nothing over the top. I wasn't molested (although I theorize it was a possibility due to the proximity of family members that are molesters and how an entire section of family was eliminated from my life at an early early age). I wasn't beaten (or even spanked). I was housed, clothed, fed; all basic necessities were met. I lived in a less than ideal house, in a less than ideal area, in a less than ideal town, but again it wasn't the worst. People have had it far worse than I have in all these areas. I am the youngest of many but only grew up with one due to the age gaps. My closest brother in age, and the one I grew up with is autistic. Will always need constant care autistic. My father when I was young was a drug addict, then a gambler, then an alcoholic, and was always a racist. When I got older him and I became closer (due entirely to my bartending and him drinking), but he died a little over a year ago. My mother is...difficult. A counselor decided my description of her made her come across as high functioning autistic. After some thinking on it, it felt right. She doesn't touch, she doesn't express love, sensory overload is a real thing for her. She loves little, is angry often, and while parading herself as a strong independent woman, often needs help with simple tasks and refuses to do anything out of her comfort zone. She doesn't drive. When my dad was dying in a hospital 15 mins away, she didn't take off work, she didn't find a ride, and she certainly never considered driving herself to see him. It wasn't that she didn't care, it's just out of her comfort zone. I have no relationship with my other siblings. One of my brothers, the only other one I remember living with me, was diagnosed with schizophrenia and hung himself in a city park from a tree a few years back.  I have a suspicion that he had fetal alcohol syndrome, but at the very least a serious disciplinary problem from an early age. He also had a serious drug problem and was in and out of jail/prison often. We were poor, but maintained the minimum. I think my biggest complaint, and the one that continues to fuck me up years later, is the lack of emotional support.

&amp;#x200B;

Dad worked and was fighting addiction in whatever form it took at that moment. Mom has always been emotionally unavailable. My brother, the closest in age to me, was a struggle for my mom because of the severe autism and my father was both verbally and physically abusive to him. My father never understood that my brother was never going to function the way my father felt he ought to. My mother started collecting animals. Expensive ones, Persians at first, then dogs, then both in order to breed them and make money. At some points we probably had upwards of 30 animals in a small house, primarily in cages. Again food, water, clean cage; basics were met, but even as a kid I felt it wasn't right. They didn't get love, or when they did it wasn't to the extent that I feel a responsible pet owner should provide. Many years later the same would happen, but it was rescued animals. She felt/feels like she was doing the world a good thing by providing homes to shelter animals. That the life she gave them, or giving them life in general, was a positive thing regardless of the fact that they received little attention or probably spent more time in a cage than not. 

&amp;#x200B;

I obviously knew this wasn't a normal way of things, however, I think it took me years away from home to feel the full gravity of how fucked up it all actually was. I wasn't taken places as a kid. I never learned how to swim. I really wasn't allowed to do much. I explicitly remember, as a child, fighting for the chance to walk across the street to play with my neighbors kids. When I was eventually allowed to, I always felt different. Uninvited. Inconsequential. These feelings followed me into adulthood. I developed a sensitivity. My mother was bad at wording her feelings without being abusive so I developed the ability to sense them. Sometimes that trait is a positive, but now especially as an adult, it manifests itself in anxiety. If I feel something is wrong it's not easy for me to let go once I pick it up. I constantly over analyze. Words hurt. Listening to my parents verbally abuse each other, me, my brother. Neither one were good communicators. I learned to be self sufficient, but I hate asking for help. I have no safety net. If I fail, no one is here to save me or cushion the fall, and honestly they would be the last people I would confide in.

&amp;#x200B;

I could keep this going. I have enough examples of times I was hurt to write a book. I guess what I want is some feedback. How do you cope with feeling like you missed out? How do you interact now, as adults, with families that are what you wanted, would have given anything to have, without that feeling that you don't deserve whats being offered? How do you fight the anxiety of over analyzing, or distrust, that comes from a foundation like mine or yours? How do you operate as a sensitive soul in a world so insistent on kicking you when you feel like you've been kicked enough?",10Jul2019,3
5,"My therapist has asked me to keep a mood journal but hasn't explained to me why or what exactly he wants me to do, thus I'm not really sure what he expects from me. I tried explaining this to him but he just didn't seem to understand, instead he seems to have taken my questioning the helpfulness or why this was being asked of me as non-compliance. 

As far as I'm concerned the problem is in how I THINK, not my moods - the moods are a symptom.

I know why I think the way I do, so I don't understand why he can't talk to me about thoughts/feelings. 

He told me just to write about 'extreme' moods...what counts as extreme? I'm depressed so my mood is typically 24/7 low/numb unless I'm actively suicidal, which is rare and there are no specific triggers for that other than my thinking. 

Plus I have problems with [Alexithymia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexithymia) so I can't always describe the feeling as anything other than 'bad', and when I'm suicidal I'm not exactly going to pause sitting with a blade to my wrist to go 'Ooops, better jot this down for Dave'.

I've two weeks before I see him again...I really hate writing things down, but am I expected to keep a diary of EVERY SINGLE THOUGHT/MOOD every day for these two weeks? What if I don't become actively suicidal in this time? My mood diary will literally just look like 'okay'...'okay'...'okay'...'okay' every single day. I just find this idea frustrating/difficult. 

I've been going to him for nine weeks (I only have three weeks left then no more therapy for a year) and we've barely even touched on my depression, it's normally small talk about what I've done the past week, today I called him out on this but it still feels like his focus is in the wrong place. I don't know why I'm doing this so I'm just really confused.",10Jul2019,3
6,"I started seeing a new therapist last week and I did the things he suggested. I went to my pcp today and had my medication changed. They’re putting me on Wellbutrin while I ween off the Zoloft that wasn’t working anymore. They also gave me Ativan for my anxiety. I’ve been so anxious the last couple of days because I was afraid the doctor would thing that I was just seeking pills. However, she was amazing. Apparently she has her own struggles and she was amazing to talk to. She was very laidback and nonjudgmental. I actually feel like my situation could actually change at the moment and I’ve finally found the people who can help me. I think it’s too late for my marriage, I put my wife under more strain than she could handle so I don’t blame her for wanting to leave me. I tried to be a better person for her and I just never could. I think someday, I could finally be a good person with something to offer someone again someday. One day at a time, I say. Maybe tomorrow will finally be a great day.",10Jul2019,6
7,"So I started a new job some weeks ago. I think I had some expectations that weren't met - not even close. I think my mindset added to it.

Since then, I fell down - hard. In the first week I was feeling terrible. Nobody there did anything bad to me at all - on the opposite, people tried to connect with me, but I felt I just didn't fit in. I felt a huge loneliness (which I was already feeling in the past, but I wasn't so aware of it - it came to a peak on that week). And now, after some time, yes, some people aren't so cool and make me feel I don't belong in there.

As I rationalized things a bit, it got better. But better as in ""I don't feel horrible for being here"", not as in ""I'm past the problems and I'm fine"". I'm not okay. My confidence is shattered and I can't see how I'll get around this.

I thought about leaving the job, but where to? And to risk having another bad experience somewhere else? At least they pay well and it's close to where I live. I could quit without major financial problems (I have saved a lot in the past and I live with my parents). But then again, the stress of leaving a job, after so many interviews in many companies, of disappointing people around me, of seeing myself as ""weak"" or as someone with issues that cannot be solved make think twice about leaving it.

I'm not sure if I should leave or stay. There is this constant weight on my chest, on my stomach, one that does not let me smile with joy, that does not let me go about lightly. I feel a weight from the moment I wake up to the moment I'll sleep. And time flies away when I'm home, sooner than not it's time for work again. I think about the weekend constantly.

All this after a year of incredible therapy for depression and anxiety associated with meds. I got so well that I concluded therapy last year and I stopped taking meds. I was alright for months (apart from ocasional stress and being tired). Two weeks before starting work I was relaxed and fine (or at least I thought so, something may have been lurking inside).

A good thing, if any, is that even if I'm not feeling fine, I haven't fallen into the abyss either, probably thanks to what I learned in therapy. There is this constant feeling of sadness, apathy and exhaustion, but at least I haven't reached the ocean floor, I am managing to not let myself get there.

But now I don't know what to do to recover, to heal. I've been trying, but I'm so apathetic and feeling powerless with everything, I just don't know what to do.

I don't know if I should look for another job, or change to another area, my desire, truly, is to run away to somewhere isolated, in the middle of nature, and stay there, away from all problems and concerns. I am a sensitive person and now I'm hypersensitive, it's so easy for anything to trigger my sadness or anxiety.

I'm thinking about going back to therapy (I sent my therapist a message today to check on her schedule, I'm waiting for an answer), though it seems like a major, huge failure, after all that I accomplished last year (at least what I thought I had accomplished).

I think that I can't get up because all ways I have before me don't please me, they all seem alike, it feels like I'll never find a job that I truly like and I can't just not work because I eventually will need to sustain myself.

8,"I have been having issues with my social life with a certain group of friends for a while now, which has happened at an especially bad time since I haven't considered myself to be mentally stable since late March.

A couple hours later he sends streaks on Snapchat. 

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to this my other friend in this group has been doing a similar thing. I asked her about re-adding me to the group chat I have with these friends after leaving to which she said she would, and I said go for it. She never responded and did not re-add me, but responded to a snap I sent. Is this normal or am I being treated wrong? I honestly can't tell if they're doing this on purpose??

11,"Hey guys, I have been struggling with paranoia, anxiety, and constant intrusive thoughts regarding terrible things happening in today's world. I read the news often, and all I see is reports of murder, injustice, child/sex trafficking, the latest updates to what's happening in Sudan, or women/ young girls getting brutally assaulted/raped. These headlines make me constantly panicked and I start having terrible thoughts over them happening to me, my younger siblings, or anyone I love. I am generally mentally very strong; I just do not know why these thoughts come to me more often now. Everytime I leave my house or see my brother and sister playing outside, I get nervous and fearful that any horrible thing can happen to them at any time. I have these weird vivid thoughts of terrible things happening to them and i don’t get why; I love them so much and so fiercely that it makes me tear up sometimes when I can’t control it.

13,"Hello. I have come here to discuss my anxiety and the recent revelation that I have lost my faith. To clarify thing, I would identify myself as agnostic, but I still hold the door open for the possibility of the existence of a God. I will not specify how I got to this point, since this subreddit isn't for discussing theology and philosophy. Also, I have nothing against anyone who is religious, since we can be separated by oceans and borders and can't know each other face to face. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had been diagnosed with anxiety for a while now. When my father had a serious drinking problem in my freshman year of high school, my mother had found a new church that I will not name for legal and privacy reasons. I had been going to church fairly regularly, as much as I could with both parents working full-time. I would like to clarify now that faith or lack thereof did not cause my anxiety before I explain anything else. Part of me felt embarrassed at the time when I told people that I couldn't make it to church every Sunday due to my parent's work schedule. Starting around Junior year, I had covertly began questioning my faith without anyone really knowing. When I had graduated and started my first job, I had admitted to myself that I had questions. When I finished my Spring semester, I had admitted to myself that I was an agnostic. 

&amp;#x200B;

My anxiety had made this process quite difficult, since I had been afraid to really say much to family for fear of being called any number of names (my parents were also paying my Communitty College education until I transfer to a four-year place along with transportation, since I don't drive). I have only really told a few strangers on the internet and a few close friends about this, with mostly support for who I was becoming. I want to eventually talk about this with family, but I don't know how to do this without making things worse.

I dealt with very present depression/suicidal thoughts in high school. For the past 4-5 years it’s been mostly under control, except for the occasional panic attack and occasional breakdown. However my breakdowns (including suicidal thoughts) have been getting more frequent again in the past few months. 

Today was a perfectly great day. It’s my birthday &amp; nothing was wrong at all. SO, roomate, friends, family all wished me a happy day &amp; sent presents, I had a nice evening out for dinner &amp; volleyball with friends.

This kind of thing has been becoming more frequent in my life again. I’ve never been medicated for depression &amp; I’m wondering if these sporadic, unpredictable breakdowns are a sign that I should consider/seek it or if I’m just over reacting and have other, more appropriate courses of action I should take?

17,"6 years ago, I experienced my first depressive episode. I tried prozac and when that didn't work, I switched to pristiq. I didn't find either of them helpful, and they gave me mild anxiety. that lifted when I stopped the meds. I've had mild depression since, but it's on and off and I just live with it.

4 years ago, after a sudden death in the family, I started getting bad anxiety. 2 years ago the anxiety ramped up, I tried lexapro to treat it, and it helped with the anxiety. It also made me feel depressed (sleeping all the time, low motivation, apathy). I switched to zoloft, but same problem. I weaned off. I still struggle with anxiety but I just live with it. 

This summer I had a depressive episode. I felt pessimistic about meds, but the depression was really bad, probably the worst I've had since my first episode. I trusted my therapist who recommended wellbutrin. It helped so so much with the depression. For a few weeks I felt completely great. Now it's sort of settled down to a mild/moderate depression, but nowhere near as bad as it was. However, since the first day I took it...the anxiety is back. For a while I could ignore it by reminding myself that it's just medication-induced and it's not real. But it's started to bleed into my life and affect my thoughts. (I can 100% deal with physical symptoms of anxiety. it's when I started doubting everything around me and making weird decisions based off those thoughts that I'm not pleased.) 

I'm considering weaning off the wellbutrin, but I'm afraid of the severe depression coming back. I'm having trouble telling what's medication-induced anxiety and what's me. That is, I'm afraid that even if I wean off the meds, the anxiety won't resolve. on the other hand, I'm afraid of fucking up my relationships with my anxiety-induced panic over everything (i.e. my partner didn't text me back so I'm convinced he's going to break up with me. that sort of insanity.)

tl;dr if I take meds for depression, it makes me anxious. If I take meds for anxiety, it makes me depressed. I feel super lost. I'm not asking for medical advice. But if anyone has any input or success stories, I'd love to hear them.",10Jul2019,1
18,"So I just had dinner and got attacked by my parents for wanting a guinea pig. My dad won't let me get a service dog, and my mom won't let me get a snake. I really want either a snake or a guinea pig, possibly as an ESA and to give me motivation to take care of something. Kind of like if I had a service dog I would be motivated to feed, walk, brush, and play with them. Instead I get hit with ""YOU DON'T EVEN CLEAN YOUR ROOM HOW WOULD YOU CLEAN IT'S CAGE!?"" And for some odd reason dad agreed??? And said that I don't even take care of the cat. The fuck?? She's not even really my pet, or at least not until recently. We really didn't like each other. But lately I've been playing with her and brushing her more. Mom feeds her and dad changes the liter. How is that not fair? Why do I suddenly have to do everything for the cat to prove I can get a guinea pig? Also the thing about me not cleaning my room isn't even true. My mom and I just have two different thresholds of dirtiness. If there's a few articles of clothing on the floor she'd call that dirty. I wouldn't, I wait until there's a bunch of stuff on the floor because that's when it bothers me the most. And then I actually pick up my room. So that's totally unrelated. 

TW: Suicide, self harm, Period talk.

Second, no one in my family believes me when I say I show symptoms of my period 2 weeks before I get them. (Maybe a little less) For context I have PMDD so it effects half of the month if not more. My mom asks if I'm irritable like it's my fucking fault. No one in my family understands the effects of PMDD and how suicidal it makes me, how sensitive I become. And when I say sensitive like if you yell at me for something small I'll possibly self harm or think about it at least. Not for attention like with borderline personality disorder but because you've actually made me upset. I have mood swings from feeling super angry and homicidal to super depressed and suicidal, along with other issues. People laugh and are ""Haha same!!!"" I really don't believe you can have PMDD and not be disabled.

And since I'm ranting and this is making me feel a little bit better and less suicidal. My dad just casually ignoring my pyschosis. I had two really bad episodes of derealization over the weekend. Saturday I had to lay down because I was dizzy. And making myself lunch was really hard because I felt like I was caught between time moving really fast and really slow. Then Sunday I think it was triggered by the chairs at church being moved slightly. It was really bright but my parents said it was actually very cloudy that day. I looked at my dads face and I like couldn't believe where I was it. It was strange as shit. Not to mention I see shit at night because of my possible nyctophobia 😝 Luckily this time with my suicidal episode I haven't heard any voices so that's good I guess. 

I'm feeling slightly better now, I don't know if I'll actually interact with my parents again tonight I might just need to be alone. Again, really wish I had a pet that was actually mine to snuggle with. I'm gonna try not to do anything too bad to myself but ahaha we'll see 💓",10Jul2019,1

Part of the problem is I can't motivate myself to meet anyone unless I find them attractive, I'm a pretty big introvert and meeting ppl is so draining. 

How do I become less looks-focused? Meeting ppl in real life is really hard because I'm pretty deaf and also queer and it just complicates things so much - pretty much have to use online dating. Once I get to know someone and like their personality I can find then attractive when I previously didn't. But that's not happening on a dating app, so I need to change my thinking on this.",10Jul2019,1

He's 15 now and stable (yay!) so I've turned my focus to helping other families out there who are dealing with this diagnosis. There is still very little information available about DMDD and what's out there is scattered in little pieces across various books, websites, and videos, so I just launched a new website - [DMDD.org](https://DMDD.org) \- to provide a single source for DMDD education and support.

24,"Hello redittors, 
I am 32  and about a year I started waking up early morning like 4 am and not being able to fall asleep till 7 am after. When I wake up I feel rested and not sleepy at all. But the worst thing happens after when at 7 am I am falling asleep like crazy.

Right now It happens once or twice a week and when it happens I become a sleeping zombie for the whole day, it is terrible.

I have a guess that it may happen due some stress or work pressure, like yesterday I had some problems at work and I woke up today at 5 am. But it might be not only that.

27,"i’m sharing this (from a burner account, i do actually post here) because all i read about is people starting therapy and addressing their problems and getting better, and i’m doing everything right but just feeling more frustrated. can anyone relate to this, and better yet, has related and found a way out? 

I’ve been seeing a therapist for over a year now 1-2x a week when an entanglement of sorts made me see just how messed up i am behind the perfect facade (he treated me exactly like i treated the men i cared deeply for but was unable to show it, which made me realize this behavior in myself). 

By all objective evaluations I can tell my therapist is great and we do mesh well. he gets me. he’s also very expensive and fully booked/doesn’t take insurance with great credentials. so any angle i look at it, i think he’s about as good as it gets. i read books he suggests, we do EMDR, have been on and off meds, anything he suggests i try. and i have no plans to stop seeing him. I can see all of my patterns very clearly now in myself and pick up on them quickly in others, and can understand how these patterns developed from my upbringing. 

but how to actually change them? 

my entire personality/sense of humor/what makes me “me”, funny, charming, etc, attracts a certain kind of person. and those are the only people that i can tolerate, who I feel like “get” me. the precision with which I can subconsciously pick out other similarly damaged people is uncanny, no matter how normal or healthy they appear initially. the healthy people I can’t tolerate being around more than to a superficial degree, the damaged people I don’t usually give in to since I’m trying to get better. but after certain lengths of zero closeness, eventually I just need something and let one of them in knowing exactly where it’s going go. I don’t see a way out of either being entirely isolated, or occasionally allowing myself to get close to someone who I know is going to use me and dispose of me (not intentionally, but they don’t know how else to be). So either way, I’m on my own. 

all of the conventional advice sounds great and all, but it just doesn’t work. i’m beautiful with a bohemian effortless look (which i’ve worked very hard for), strong education and reasonable income for an expensive area, lots of hobbies and interests and mediocre talents, travel adventurously, meditate, do crossfit and yoga and journal and get  7-8 hrs of good quality sleep, can hold my own in most social scenarios. i’ve done all of this to learn how to survive on my own. 

but all I want is a partner, a family, a community. Something that’ll stay with me as i get older, if I get sick, laid off, let a wrinkle form. I’m 30.

29,"I feel that I am beginning to develop a mental illness of some sort, maybe OCD? My grandmother has OCD, anxiety, and seasonal depression which all can be hereditary if I’m correct. But anyway, I have a constant feel that I need to start over in everything. For example: I cannot keep social media because after a week or two I get very anxious and feel that I need a fresh start. 

The earliest I can pinpoint this happening is around middle school when I would play animal crossing and constantly start my town over and over again, I never kept a town for longer than a month. Same thing with when I would play Minecraft. I have a hobby of art and the same thing applies. I have not kept sketchbooks in years because I get anxiety about a quarter way through and throw them away. Not having a consistent art style is something that plagues my mind.

Another thing that is much more recent is anxiety about my past. I have always been very shy and awkward but recently I’ve been breaking out of my shell. I know your past doesn’t define you, but I have changed a lot and am a completely different person (for the better, I am much happier now) but I feel that none of that matters because of how I was years ago. In my mind, people will judge me for how I used to be and how I used to look not matter how I am now or how far I have come. 

I also had these sort of face tics I guess where I could not keep my face still for longer than 30 seconds. Thank GOD this passed, but basically I would always have to scrunch my nose or raise my eyebrows slightly or pretty much anything so my face wouldn’t be still. I have never been diagnosed with anything in my life and I don’t believe in self diagnosing, though it’s pretty obvious I have anxiety and have had it pretty much my entire life. I can’t really talk to my parents about this and seek help, but I’m very scared of it becoming worse as I grow into adulthood.

34,"Hello, I'm a 21 year old guy, and I have a horrible perspective of myself. (I also apologise this in advance: I sometimes have difficulty with how I should phrase my sentences, so if anything I say doesn't sound clear, feel free to ask about it.)

I'm currently struggling with being unemployed for over 2 months now. After beginning to search for jobs a friend decided to help me create a cover letter for applications because I had issues writing one myself. It feels almost impossible to come up with positive things about myself. I need to advertise myself for why I deserve a job, but from my perspective I haven't been THAT great at any of my prior jobs, just satisfactory. My friend put way too much effort into getting a decent amount of my qualities for this. Outside of a person that is well-mannered and respectful, I don't see anything else that makes me a good candidate for anything. At all.

Another area that I've noticed this issue is when it come to dating. After getting to know somebody fairly well I explained to him thst I don't see myself as somebody worth dating. I have an unfinished Associate's Degree and I'm currently not enrolled in college(I'm temporarily suspended for poor grades due to lack of attendance), and I wasn't making that much money at my low end job. I don't see any appeal. I also have no confidence in my appearance, but that's something to talk about another time.

It makes me feel horrible when I see other people my age going to 4 year universities, or others being successful at something they truly enjoy and can live an affordable yet happy lifestyle. Once I have a new job, I don't have any goals. I know having ADHD and depression make things more difficult as well as make things seem worse than what they are, but I don't see what I have to offer to the world, whether it be where I work or who I'm romantically interested in. I don't know what to do, and I need to hear opinions from others.

I have never tried online therapy, mainly because I've tried talk therapy and didn't find it helpful (although I'm reading a CBT book that's proving to be great). Also, I didn't have a the best experience with an online psychiatrist either (he didn't show up for the appointment), but I still think that the concept of online psychiatry a good idea. In the process of setting up this appointment, I was surprised how many online options there were to get psychiatric medication. It was certainly easier to book an online appointment than one through my insurance. Has anyone else tried online treatments? How to you feel online psychiatrist and therapists compare to in person ones?

Also, as I was looking into the different online treatment options, it seemed like it would be useful bring everything together in one place. My friend and I built a site to this end, thinking it and hoping it will help other people ([https://nouscare.io](https://nouscare.io/)).

38," Hi! I joined this because I’m kind of out of hope for my life. I have anxiety and depersonalization. I’ve had it since I was 13. Some back story. At the age of 13 i went into anaphylactic shock out of no where.(**TRIGGER WARNING )** All I could remember was the feeling of my throat slowly choking itself and being rushed to the hospital where they then overdosed my lil ass body on bendryl and I started to quite literally die. I had to be rushed from that hospital to yale hospital where I stayed for few days recovering. A week later, I went into shock again and lived the nightmare over again (minus the overdose). After that hospital stay I felt different. I would be scared to eat, go outside or take medicine in fear of going into shock again. My mom and doctor wanted me to get counseling right there and then because of how traumatic it was to me. I said no bc I thought i was fine. Fast forward its freshman year im 14 and im doing ok. Up until November 16th. A group of girls decided that it would be good idea to bring me into the lunchroom and beat me unconscious. I really do not remember much of when it was actually happening but i did get a fucked up jaw, a concussion, bleeding behind my eyes, and a brain cyst caused by the blunt trauma of my head being banged into the sink. I was homeschooled the rest of freshman year for obvious reasons. Sophmore year rolls around and i am the laughing stock of the school for getting me ass beat. My ""friends"" wouldn't talk to me. This is when my anxiety started to peak. I couldnt eat, it felt wierd to talk, i wouldnt leave the house in fear that someone would either hurt me or make fun of me. I got through it though. Junior year to be honest was the same as sophmore but i pushed through it. The summer before senior year is where my mind got all sorts of fucky. and i finally decided that i needed help. I’m 18 now. It is only getting worse. It’s to the point where I can’t go out in public or even to my grandmas house. I couldn’t even stay in school my senior year I had to be homeschooled (still graduated with a diploma though :)) anyway. I always have the CONSTANT feeling that “omg I am going to drop dead or have a seizure right now” and it sounds irrational because it is, but it’s taken over my life, it’s to the point where I don’t even like being awake anymore.

When i talk it feels like my voice of coming from someone else, i see myself in the mirror and its a mind fuck..

40,"Hello all. I figured this sub might be a fit for what I’m about to post, but if not, I apologize. This is also going to be very, very long. 

So let’s just get right into it. My sister is turning 29 this year and we are 10 years apart, me being younger. I also have a 31 year old sister who had her first child 2 weeks ago. We’ll call the sister in question “A” and the new mom “V”. V’s Husband will be “Bob”. This will come later on in the post. 

For as long as I can remember A was difficult. She was always good intentioned I think, but the way she went about things were always very bizarre and she held delusions about the results of her actions. Family events are always extremely drama-filled, and I hate to admit it’s because of her, but it really is. She finds something she doesn’t like, tries to solve it in whatever way her brain comes up with on the spot, gets offended when people don’t agree, and complains some more. She’ll find any reason to do this. She’ll find any reason to have control over any situation or “fix” it. While she tries to fix whatever situation she thinks needs fixing, she is always the victim. Everyone that does not enable her to do whatever she wants whenever she wants is always “disrespecting the family” and “never sticks up for her when she sticks up for everyone”. She’s also quite hyperactive. She HAS to be actively engaged in something fun or exciting or she will cry and moan about people not wanting to spend time with her or hating her. 

I really do think there’s a sweet girl that always wants the best for people in there. I really do. But sometimes she gets into these “frenzies” where she cannot stop. Her eyes look different and her energy feels really bad. It doesn’t even feel like the same person. She yells and fights and cries and storms out over almost nothing. 

**Now for the story that prompted this.**

Last week my mother went to go visit V and Bob, and of course her precious new granddaughter. Mom calls me to tell me about how on DAY ONE of everyone being together, V and Bob are already tired of A. A nonstop complains about Bob being “abusive” to V (not at all the case. I promise you.) and goes to V to yell at her for being stupid and blind and that she needed to divorce Bob right away because he’s killing her or something. Mom doesn’t agree. Bob doesn’t care what A has to say about him. V is tired cause her baby is always hungry and now A thinks she’s the victim because no one agrees with her. She storms off to her own hotel room and refuses to stay the nights at V’s place. 

This goes on for the entire time they were all together. It was apparently miserable the entire time solely because A was causing a fight every single time she opened her mouth (and I believe it, as we had a similar vacation 2 years ago that I came to that was just as miserable for the same reasons). One of the last days A calls mom to come to A’s hotel to play monopoly with her. Reminder that this was originally a family gathering where everyone came for the sole purpose of spending time with V and her baby. But A doesn’t like Bob so now the vacation is about A having fun and mom leaving V’s house to come play fucking monopoly with her instead. 

This is clearly a problem she’s had for a very very long time. I remember once as a kid I made myself some eggs, and I was so proud of it, and I took my eyes away from my plate for a second and she just squirted ketchup all over them cause “she likes ketchup on her eggs”. They were MY eggs and I was so angry at her, and she caused a scene about how I hate her or how I’m ungrateful for her helping me. To this day she still does this. During the last week, mom got some chicken soup and A decided to just pour some tomato sauce all over moms chicken soup. Because A thinks that’s tasty. It’s just food but I think this selfish disregard for other people kinda sums her up pretty well. She thinks she’s helping them. But she’s doing the opposite. And she doesn’t know when to quit. 

I guess to sum it up, A has no sense of boundaries, a savior complex, and has very clear highs and lows where she’s super fun and hyper and happy one second, and the next, it’s like she’s enjoying looking for things to be upset or depressed about or to be victimized. Everything’s about her and her enjoyment. The minute she’s not actively enjoying herself, that’s when this thing comes out of her. It’s not the same person. It’s almost crazed, pushy, like some endless motor has replaced her heart and she’s running on gasoline. Her eyes get all wide and angry and she Will. Not. Stop. She has to have the last word. A fight with A is not winnable. You will always lose. Unbeknownst to her, she’ll never win either.

My mom was talking to me about all this as a distressed mom who felt like she failed with her. She also talked about the parallels between A and my moms mom. Her mom acted just like A does now, only to a more extreme extent. She was always the victim, and very selfish. Physically and emotionally abusive. Manipulative. Any negative word can fit her in some capacity. But the main similarity is the polarity of their personalities. Mom sometimes saw her mom as her mom. But sometimes she says it felt like her mom wasn’t actually her mom anymore, like she’s been possessed by something and made her feel fear right down into her gut. Her eyes would widen and she’d go into frenzies where nothing she’d say make logical sense. All of a sudden she would explode about something and blame everyone but herself. The worst it got was when she once snuck into my moms bedroom with a knife and chanted “kill”, only to be stopped by... just changing her mind. 

The scary part is that after this last week, mom is now 100% certain A got her behavior from that woman. And now my mom is afraid of A. She no longer wants to speak to her for a while, and especially not go to any more family gatherings with her. 

So. Long, LONG story short, I have no idea what’s wrong with my sister. If she has some kind of undiagnosed illness that she may have genetically inherited from my also undiagnosed grandmother, then maybe there’s a chance she can be helped. As much resentment as I hold towards her right now, I do really really really want her to be helped. I have no idea how to do it and I don’t even know if it’s my place to do so anymore. All I know is that if she continues down this path, she will die alone like my grandmother did. And I know that the A that I resent is not all there is to her. I hate that that is all I associate with my sister now.",10Jul2019,2

Im a male 

Parents divorced at the age of 2. My dad had majority custody went to my moms every other weekend and most of the summer.

Mom just simple disappeared when I was 10. I got no explanation from her or my father on what was going on.

My father would just badmouth my mother on her leaving. I would not get any emotional support from him and I didn't get any sort of help.

My father and step mother were emotionally and physically abusive which only escolated when my grades and behavior in school got worse. The  weight of the world would be brought down on me for it, and the times I did try to be better it wouldn't be noticed and I received no encouragment to try harder. I was told my mother doesn't love me because she left and was told I was lazy or a bad kid for my behavior. 

I started drinking alcohol and smoking when I was 12. Alcoholic when I was 15. Quit drinking and even experienced alcohol withdrawal syndrome at 19

Mom reconnected with me when I was 19. She took no blame in the situation. I've tried talking to her about it twice now and I get nothing out of her except dodging blame.

I called my dad out on all of the shit and did get an apology from him and he is different now and does try but is still an emotionally unavailable person.

I'm 30 now. Even though I have closure with my father all that stuff still affects me. My mother I talk to still but it's small talk and I feel no real love for her. I dont hate her but I feel indifferent towards her.

I have low self worth. I haven't received any mental health help. I've just been coping and maintaining. When I get depressed I am so drained of energy I feel weak but I force myself to get out of bed and go to work. If I'm not working I just want to lay down all day. I have bad anxiety and don't Interact with anyone except people at work or my wife at home. I'm partly afraid to get help and a part of me tells myself I'm not worth it.      I'm just maintaining my existence. 

I just don't even know where to go to get help. I have anxiety about paying for help. Everytime ive opened up to someone about my life I end up feeling stupid and even more depressed afterwards. I don't even know what I'm doing here asking for. Im just so confused on what my life even is or what I'm even supposed to do. I've never felt like killing myself but I'm afraid that If I don't do something different than coping with this by myself like I have been for 20 years then eventually one day it's going to get worse and I'll become suicidal or something.

Ever since then i have hated women and have never found anything attractive about them like i did before. Ever since this accident i have never had a crush for anyone, feelings, nothing. All mutual feelings. All my friends have lost their virginity, had their first kiss, had at least a crush,, yet here i am and have never once in my life even liked someone romantically. Its not like i don’t wanna feel the affection because i do, i really do. I lack alot of the affection if im being honest, I haven’t been hugged or kissed by anyone ever besides my parents and the girl who raped me. I more so often start to cry when talking about someone at least hugging me to friends (just bringing up someone hugging me) or the thought of someone at least touching me, i lack the affection alot. Its not even affection at this point either to be honest, i lack alot of psychical and mental human interaction. Ever since ive started to realize this ive been getting a poor self body image and officially fully hating myself, and i have no clue why.
Theres still alot more to it but i cant put the feelings into words, but it psychically hurts me.

52,"Hello there,

I am 30 year old male who is suffering from schizophrenia for half of my life now. Yesterday I got absolutely blown away when I (and my family) witnessed effect environment can have on my health.

&amp;#x200B;

So I always tell to people close to me to follow golden rule: Silence, cool/cold weather, no bright lights and not many people around me (no crowds). Since I don't work I spend my time mostly in houses. Both one near capital city and seaside house. I noticed that as soon as I go to city (which is usually avoided) I immediately get agitated, anxious, extreme sweating and feeling of unwell. This one house is near our largest city (capital) of nearly million citizens, but it's on outskirts. Still, my pulse is almost always over 85 bpm and my blood pressure rises. Here on seaside closest city has just around 200k citizens and feeling when going in city is already milder. But house is again of outskirts. Why I am telling it is because what happened yesterday.

&amp;#x200B;

It's summer here, tourists, commotion... In one word, hell! But few days ago we were struck by severe cold front and storms. To my surprise, basically miracle happened. I had extreme difficulty breathing which was probably connected to psychosis prior this storm. But yesterday, it was gone. I feel I can breathe better than before. My pulse dropped to extremely low value for me, so low in fact it's scary. 54 BPM! I haven't even taken any tranquillisers or pills.Jut the fact that storm produced calm, cool, people-free environment basically ""cured"" me. It feels like heaven now. I do stay with my mother who is old, and we both find this extremely calming and beneficial to our health (she has coronary diseases).

&amp;#x200B;

What I want to ask is your opinion and personal experience. Is it really possible that peace, quiet, solitude, cold weather can have such drastic beneficial effect on health of psychotic people or am I exception? I am aware that mental institutions are usually located in peaceful, isolated places. Now I know why.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I'd like your advice. We are in process of selling our property. My brother and partially my mother crave for this ""moving"" in the city and life in city. Which is quite justified as my brother is young, modern person who works. Yet, every time they mention word city, my heart starts pounding and I start freaking out. I get extremely aggressive and say only over my dead body would I go there to live. Can anyone advise me how can I negotiate with them and make compromise which won't destroy family and harm their or my wishes?

Thank you kindly",10Jul2019,1

55,"Hey there,

I am bad with words and English is not my native language so this might be long, a bit messy and weird to read, sorry for that, I want to give as much info as possible to get a helpful response and also get my thoughts straight for the first time. A lot of things I write here I haven't been able to tell anyone IRL yet, so I also use this post to start building the confidence to talk about this.  


I'm diagnosed with **depression**, and my current therapist said I was also strong in the **anxiety** column and considered **bipolar**, both of which have never been brought up to me before, but could be true.

I have noticed **dissociative** symptomes on myself, but haven't felt comfortable to tell him about it, but this has been confirmed by another therapist and a psychology student who brought it up in a conversation on some experiences.

Also while reading and searching for help online I stumbled on different writings mentioning **BPD (borderline)** or **HPD (histrionic)** as a source for some of my symptoms. This has never been brought up to any professional yet, so I still have the fear of not knowing and the hope to not having to deal with a personality disorder.

&amp;#x200B;

I often feel like I'm the problem, and I'm the toxic one in my relationships. When I get into ""fights"" with my mother in law because I told the truth, and my partner then expects me to apologize but not his mother. Since this happens regularily I feel like I'm the problem here.  
When I get into arguments with friends I often tend to get passive-aggressive and emotionally abusive.

I have trouble regulating my anger and other emotions. When I'm in a bad mood I try to keep it out of unrelated topics especially not projecting it onto my partner who hasn't done anything wrong. I fail at this often and make him sad which in turn makes me sad, and I don't know what he could do to help me...

&amp;#x200B;

I don't open up to others easily to tell them what is going on and how I feel etc. I feel lke I can't trust people and to not rely on others. I was bullied in school and let down by several people including the teachers who didn't stop it. I applied for internships and didn't get a reply even after it was promised at the end of an interview. I asked a former teacher to help me with translating my internship contract into English. He promised to bring it to Germany with him. He didn't. I feel like I'm not worthy.

&amp;#x200B;

Most recently I'm struggling to write my final paper. I don't know where and how to start the writing (not the research work) and that takes my motivation; I feel like I'm incapable and like a failure. I spend the days wasting my time trying to write, finding mental health professionals that I feel comfortable contacting, or trying to find help on reddit or other online sources. Sometimes I try to do all of this at once because I can't focus on one topic long enough to finish it. I already got up to get something to drink, something to eat, let my pets out, or wander around for no other reason than I felt restless and too agitated to continue sitting still, I was bored or couldn't concentrate anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think I'm suicidal, but the only reason why I don't consider actually doing it is my partner. I love him and I don't want to hurt him, but I also don't think he understands me, and I sometimes wish we would just break up and he could move on from me and no longer have such a burden.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I don't know what else to write... I can't focus anymore and feel like I'm not even really there.

My mom has schizophrenia and ptsd ( mainly caused by her family) But they haven't learned anything about how to treat her. This will be her 6th time in a mental hospital and there still being rude to not just her but to her kin to. 

Here's an example of what they told me just these couple days:

Hopefully my mom is out before the reunion. So I can yell at all of them in for her. They treat her like garbage and then they wonder why she has another episode.

Here is all that is wrong with me today.

\- I see everything in dark, I am hopeless, I can't see the light anymore and everyday is a struggle

\- I have had OCD for quite a few years now. It means I count hours, minutes, I am fixating hard on time, timings, schedules. I know I do my work hours, I arrive at 9.30 and leave at 6pm as supposed to. These lies about my work time made my OCD even worse. Now I'm fixating even more, I am about to cry if I have even the slightest minute of delay. I have to hide all clocks on my computer (phone screen, computers, etc.) because I know I have to stay late if I want to make a good impression. As a consequence, I am always stressed. 

\- I am pissed at everyone at work. Are you well performing and well seen by the hierarchy? I hate you. It's got nothing against you personally, but I can't help it, there is this demon inside of me and it's overwhelming, it's breaking all of my personal will and destroying every once of niceness I have left. I am so sorry.

\- This demon inside of me... it's taking the best of me. It's in my stomach, in my head. It's also in nightmares that make sleep another struggle I have to face.

I have visited here a few times, but I am really needing to vent or even just be offered an “it’s okay.”
The past few months my PTSD and anxiety has came back with a vengeance. Because of that my mother and my spouse talked me into counseling and medication. Here is the thing. One of my triggers is taking medication because I had a bad reaction to morphine after a surgery. Since then I have had a lot of issues with thinking that medication will kill me.
I was vocal about this with my doctor and my counselor. The doctor set me off on the lowest dose and talked it over with me about some of the feelings I might feel, and how the medication will not hurt me. It made me feel comfortable.
I have taken it for a week now, and I am really proud of myself, but I am still finding myself panicking about maybe this time the medicine will kill me. I tend to over analyze everything. I even thought I had rabies once without ever being bitten or touched.

I've been in love with my best friend for the better part of the time we've known each other. I just can't look at any other girl the same way I do to her. I've confessed to her, yet she made it clear that she only wanted to remain friends. That was three years ago, yet here I am still in love with her.

I desperately want to become just a friend to her, but my head just won't fall out of it. I've been rejected many times over, yet I'm still head over heels. I want to rip this infatuation out of me because I know it would only damage our friendship, and that is a scary thought for me. The only problem is, I can't. I don't know how to. 

She's a wonderful person for trying to help me get over this, but even I can see the annoyance she gets when I bring up the same thing over and over and over for three years. So I stopped letting her help me. I thought it would be best if I lied to her that I was completely over her. It hurts knowing that I annoy her. Now without somebody to talk to, the problems build up in me, triggering anxiety, and depression, even suicidal thoughts from time to time. I tried everything to get rid of this killer love, yet the more I try the more it hurts. 

The more professional advise I get is I stay away from her. Eventually, if I'm deprived of interaction long enough, it'll fade away, they say. But she's my best friend. We have classes and go home everyday together. It's a ritual. How am I supposed to break that? Long story short, how could I stay away from my best friend?

75,"# Social Media impacts on youths
Social media has caused many health problems in youths such as increase in depression and anxiety. This is due to the fact that social media causes people to compare themselves to others. This causes insecurity and causes people to lack self worth by wearing what others are wearing and by trying to look like others. Regardless of gender, youths appeal to those on social media who have physical body traits such as abs and big muscles which causes youths to desperately try and lose weight and take excessive actions to try and gain the look they desire. This has caused many problems in which youths have turned to unhealthy starvation, excessive fasting and working out to much. This causes lots of health problems which can cause a risk to their lives.

This is just a very small percentage of all the severe impacts that social media causes towards youths. Instead of complaining that youths shouldn't be using social media and instead of blaming parents for bad parenting, we should instead focus on trying to get rid of this image that looks matter, that body size matter, that the cost of outfits matter because if we don't, the next generations will turn into a population of mental health problems such as severe depression, severe anxiety and even as far as suicide. 

## Cases
According to the World Health Organization, in the year 2019, approximately 1.53 million people will die from suicide. There is increasing evidence that this behavior of using social media affects and changes people's lives, especially in teenagers. 

For respect I decided to not include any real life cases as I don't think a sensitive topic like this is something you can give examples for. However, there have been hundreds of cases where teenagers have taken their own life's due to constant online harassment, bullying, blackmailing sensitive/extreme pictures and more.

#Conclusion
We need to act together as a population to solve these problems before it affects our children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews.",10Jul2019,2
76," My boyfriend has always had mental health problems, and recently has agreed to see a therapist. His therapist is still doing intake with him, trying to get to know him and what gives him extreme anxiety. Yesterday, my boyfriend came home and told me his therapist said, ""I can't officially diagnose you yet, but I would be pretty confident to say that you have OCD."" I'm a pre-med student, so I've had my fair share of abnormal psychology courses and have studied disorders like OCD quite a bit. My boyfriend has none of the hallmark symptoms of OCD; he doesn't have fears about contamination, no fears about accidental harm, doesn't care about symmetry or ordering, and no significant mental rituals. However, I definitely trust the therapist's judgement and would like to learn a bit more about OCD, as I know my boyfriend does have significant anxiety that affects his everyday life:

He gets very anxious in large groups of people, to the point where we will have to leave. We were at Disneyland on New Years Eve (bad idea), and the crowds gave him so much anxiety he could not function.

He cares very much what other people think about him, and constantly wants to make sure everyone around him is happy and having a good time. If we go out with a big group of friends, he's usually the ring leader, and seems to get very anxious if not everyone is having fun. He also is constantly seeking people's approval; mine, his parents, my parents, his coaches, etc.

He needs reassurance pretty often – I am constantly reminding him how much I love and care for him, how kind and sweet he is, etc. I love telling him these things, but he says sometimes he has a hard time believing it. He says,"" I know that you feel these things towards me, but I just have a hard time believing it for myself."" He is often worried that I am upset towards him when I'm not at all.

The only compulsion I can think of that he does is if he loses something important, like his phone or wallet, he will not stop until he finds it. We could be in the middle of a conversation, he may have just had his phone in his hand, but he will turn over every piece of furniture in the apartment until he finds it. He is also constantly checking if he's lost these items.

To me, his symptoms seem like a generalized anxiety disorder. In your experience with OCD and anxiety, have you ever seen these type of symptoms been diagnosed as an OCD disorder?",10Jul2019,2

This has obviously affected me in many ways (Things never really interested me, I isolated myself from everyone, etc) but growing up I never put two and two together.

Now that I'm starting to receive treatment (counseling and medication) I'm starting to feel better, like this new person is emerging. I guess I thought that once I started feeling better everything would change dramatically, but I still have no interests and am unmotivated to do even basic things in life. I'm scared that I really am just a lazy woman with no drive or purpose in life. I'm realizing that I have absolutely no idea who I am and feel like I'm just going through the motions of life.

95,"Hello, I am new to reddit and I have not shared some of these things with anyone. Not doctors, nor my psychologist or my close circle. I live in Europe so english is not my first language so BEAR with me :D (im sorry). Sorry for long post. I'm 19 and a female.

&amp;#x200B;

Shortly saying: I have depression, anxiety and anorexia nervosa. I have had anxiety for as long as I can remember but I never thought it was abnormal. In my third year of high school my depression got worse after some exams. 

I was always overweight. In eight grade i weighed 103 kg. Thats alot. I started to look into weight loss and such. At first it was slow and my weight was dropping at a healthy rate for about a year. Then I wanted to lose more and more weight. I never thought I could be sick, I was a whale. Bullying did not help, that happened more in the elementary school and junior high. My weight loss became more rapid after I started running. In the Christmas of 2018 in one week I ran a total of 95 km. Sounds insane right? It was also nothing weird of me at the time. I also worked out at the gym. In the beginning of January 2019 I ended up hospitalized due to bradycardia (low pulse, lowest at 24 at night). After that I was moved to a psychiatric section and stayed there about a month and could come home. I am vegan and have been since I got home (not an annoying one though). I gained weight well and have not relapsed to old habits. I am 169 cm tall and weigh now around 74-77 kg. That is where my body likes to be, I have noticed thinking back. I dont have problems with my weight now, im relatively okay.

I am never alone, anxiety will never abandon me! So I wont even get into it too much. I just get this weird anxiety in the afternoon (1-5 pm) on most days. But my depression got worse during my running period and such. I also lost my apetite at the time. I have meds for depression and the meds are supposed to help with anxiety too but I cant really tell. I have nothing special to say about my depression, I just feel worthless and disgusting most of the time. 

I have cut myself since first year of high school. It wasnt too common then, but it escalated when my anorexia got worse. I didnt cut myself in over four months, but relapsed a few weeks ago. I havent tried to kill myself but have thought about it a lot. I just dont care if I die. If I had an opportunity to die, I would take it. I sometimes think taking a LOT of meds and alcohol but I havent done it, hopefully never will.  

I have only one friend, who also happens to be my best friend. I also happen to be her only friend (and best friend). We dont talk about this stuff, because she feels uncomfortable (she hasn't admitted it but I can tell). I just hope someone would read this and shit because I need positive affirmations like 24/7. Also if anyone can relate or something, let me know! Feel free to ask me questions if you have any! No one is alone with this shit!",10Jul2019,1
96,"I'm 17 and my mind has been treating me horribly for years, My anxiety has only gotten worse, and I am starting to get frequent nightmares due to it. 

Last night, I had a dream involving a friend I made online many years ago. Recently she hasn't spoken to me at all and soon she's gonna be going into the Air Force. This makes me afraid that I won't ever get to talk to her again. So in this dream, things are going good, but for the fact that she's just endlessly ignoring every word I say, then she leaves. That dream basically tells me I'm never gonna be able to speak to her again, which is probably the truth. I woke up with pain today, it has yet to go away. It just sits in my chest, making me not want to get up.

A few nights ago. I had a dream involving an old friend in which we sorta broke apart from being friends, her name was Abby. This dream sorta focuses on her mental state and how her life went downhill once everyone seemingly stopping being around her. When we met back up after years of not talking, things were good. But I woke up with pain that day too. 

About a month ago, I had a dream involving a group of friends that has abandoned me (this will be more explained later on in this post). But in that dream, I'm actually friends with them again, this dream wasn't a good thing to make me feel happy, it hurt even more. When I woke up, I felt pain, just like all the others, I will wake up in pain with these sorts of dreams. A pain in my chest.

About a year and a half ago, I had a dream, I thought nothing of it, no pain, nothing, but it stuck with me for quite awhile anyways, it was of a basement. For that reason, I drew a picture of what I saw in it. Now I don't know if it's just coincidence, but probably is, but I found a basement that matches the drawing I made, it's where my aunt is moving in to.

About 2 or 3 years ago, The dream I had was painful, the kind I wake up screaming from. A night terror. It involved those friends, this being before they all abandoned me like everyone abandoned Abby before. To shorten the crazy series of events, let's just say, they all hated me, every single one of them. 

Now I say that dream helped influence actions of mine that eventually made them abandone me irl. My anxiety showing and the ways I acted after that changed. I was more on edge about losing them to a point where I freaked and caused myself to actually lose them as friends.

I had similar dreams leading up to the eventual abandonment after that, the summer before it happened, a year ago.

When I was little, I'd always have night terrors, I would rarely have something good occur. These dreams are vividly remembered by me. I'd also lucid dream easily, like it'd just happen, I was too aware of my surroundings when I was little and would be ""this is just a dream"" when something bad started happening and then get myself out. That ability phased out tho, I live with these terrors monthly, sometimes weekly if my anxiety is bad.

Sometimes, I feel as if I fit multiple personalities as well. I'll act like different people, I'll have weird phases where I'm completely not like myself. Sometimes I'm a super hyper kid like person. Or someone with serious anger issues. I sometimes act like a conspiracy theorist. I'm aware of this stuff but I can't stop it. When I was little, I mainly had anger issues, I would throw stuff, break stuff, and get suspended from school due to it. That has changed and it only flares up at random. But it's been heightened up recently, the way I speak just has an angry tone to it. I'm always tensed up and ready to break. I have before, I don't want it to occur again. 

I don't know what's wrong with me, but I know I'm crazy. The ways I act, the patterns changing, it's all weird.

Recently, starting about a couple weeks ago, I've felt younger, as if I've gone backwards on maturity. The ways I think and actions I do reflect that of me around 5-8 years ago. I've regained my childhood feeling of just writing random crap down for the fun of it, constantly listing things, tediously. When I was little, I would devote hours of my time writing every TV channel name and Number, and I did it idk how many times. I have multiple notebooks full of it. Some of which are gone. If I could post pictures here, I would, of every dream drawing I've done, and of this weird listing thing I did as a kid. I may edit later with imgur links if that's allowed.

Relationships:

In every relationship of mine, I become closer to the personality of the person I'm with, rather than myself. It one helps me escape my sorta crazy state such as me right now, but at the same time isn't exactly me anymore.

I can end up freaking out if a relationship ends, unhealthy freaking out, not at the person but at myself. 

Friendships:

Most of my friendships are now gone, down the drain cuz of me. I have no basic social skills anymore, and end up trapping myself in a bubble.

My life:

I don't do anything anymore, I stay in my room and sit on my phone, I don't enjoy things as much anymore. I do eat, so I'm fine there, it may not be much since I don't want to waste too much food, but I do. I can fall asleep too easily, I'll pass out (even in the most uncomfortable positions) and sleep 14+ hours if I let myself. I get enough sleep, so it's not sleep deprivation. 

In conclusion, I have issues, and I don't know what to do.",10Jul2019,2

After speaking with her I really thought about how much I drink and have realized I drink to much to often. She mentioned that alcohol is a central nervous system depressant which can make the side effects of abilify worse and to be honest I experienced all the warnings associated with alcohol and abilify together. 

This whole time I just thought it was abilify making me feel sluggish and “mentally slow” or impairing my thinking but when I think about it the common denominator has been alcohol.

I can prevent downward spirals, but overall, it hurts.

She has friends she talks to online. Since she is having a hard time making friends at school I never told her to quit it. My parents are skeptical about everything surrounding ""Internet people"" so she keeps it a secret from them. Everything was fine until last week she broke down crying in front of me all of a sudden. She said that one of those internet friends of her attempted suicide. That ""friend"" is 17 years old and should have known better to not talk about such a thing to a minor. It doesn't end here too. She has sent photos of all the blood and such to my sister and now because of this random stranger she is absolutely traumatised. I catch her crying secretly sometimes and I don't know what to do since I am not much help as a 19 year old. She begged me to not tell mom about it so if I'll talk about it, my sister's trust in me will shatter. As I said she is so introverted and most of the time even I don't get to hear what she is dealing with so the last thing I want to happen is to lose her trust. Today I heard my mom and dad talking about how she says things like ""why can't we go back time"". It seems they are aware of her sentimental state.

107,"I have been to the doctors today and all I can say is honestly if they don't think before they speak they will end up with those with Mental Health issues dead..  


I've been on medication long term and it finally ran out of juice. Apparently I'd been on them since 2016.. (It feels like yesterday at the same time my memory is so bad I could've been born taking them)  


About two weeks ago I went to the doctors a surgery I had just changed to after the one I previously went to had a worker at the desk who discriminated against my disability and the company running it just brushing it under the rug..   


The doctor was an old man from asia he still had a strong accent and was extremely quiet.. This would be ok other than the fact within my records it's shown I was born with a hearing issue.. He put me on medication that was completely unrelated to the previous one that I had been taking since 2016 and that's what I asked for, so i took the little bit of paper got the meds went home and took one the next night as I had taken the old useless meds that day... What I wasn't warned about was waking up the next day needing the toilet and being unable to move.. then when I could move fighting the sleep paralysis having to crawl because otherwise I'd end up falling down the stairs or over the banister. Now with that hearing problem already comes some lack of balance its a common thing with hearing. alongside that I also have issues with my legs downwards and take pain medication for this..  


I managed to make an appointment for today last week.. So I went in today new doctor never seen her before and I brought a parent due to the fact I've become extremely irritable and honestly would punch anyones face in just to get rid of the feeling..  


So how did this go? Well after her not understanding the old medication request had got to her late and her having a go at us as if I gave it directly to her to give me those old useless meds and her finally understanding the request took about 3/4 days to get to her from the little box for her to sign. we explained how I couldn't walk on this new medication and litrally fell over into a wall multiple times before having to go back to bed.. So I asked for a new medication (as any person would after experiencing such an awful thing) THIS is where it went wrong..  


The first doctor obviously didn't say ""oh and here is a lesser dose of that old medication"" no I had to go cold turkey.. And this doctor is keeping it that way. at this point I've not had any chemicals keeping me in a reasonable state for almost two weeks.. She then told me to go out for walks as if even on the medication I could go out on my own let alone without it.. Then she went on to call me fat instead of a better term like "" over weight"" no care for the mental pain the word fat or obese can cause someone.   


She also gave me some utterly useless pieces of paper to tick off so she can decide if I should go to a mental healthy counselling thing.. Now I will admit to being extremely negative about counselling. It doesn't change the issues I have and they never will. I don't see the point of repeating the same things I've repeated to countless Councillors before them because its who I am. The things that have made me this way are etched into my brain like a scar on skin or a break in glass. yes it heals and gets less painful with time but its still there ever consent..  


So now am I not only feeling bad due to the fact this doctor called me fat and acted as if depression and anxiety were just something you could ""get over"" and shit.. I feel crap because though that medication done nothing for my depression and anxiety anymore coming off of something that pumps you with chemicals honestly isn't healthy..  as for the taking a walk she uttered the words ""Things like walking release endorphins."" I know this.. But surely If I'm taking medication for mental health issues the little bit of my brain releasing endorphins isn't exactly working how it should.  


  
Now I asked for new medication and when I did so she handed me those papers and said no.. why? because I'd been on multiple medications since the age of 13 (I'm now in my mid 20s) I've not been on every medication under the sun. and the last doctor I saw in the previous surgery said I should probably go onto what I call ""anti-psychotics""  I forget the real name..  


  
I'd go into why I am the way I am what broke me at a young age and why anxiety and depression are in control of me but I see no point. The point is here.. I feel like even those who should help us. who have the records in front of them and who should care don't.. I understand doctors have stress.. To many patients not enough time.. But surely wording matters? Surely becoming toxic and not caring for those mentally well should be something they think about..  


Honestly I just needed to talk this out hoping someone here will understand. Because even though mentally I feel like I am alone without anyone to understand.. Logically I know it is impossible for us not to within certain perimeters not to understand part of something someone is going through?",10Jul2019,1
108,"A long time ago I was diagnosed with reactive depression. I've also been suffering from anxiety since I was little. 

Anxiety has morphed through the 30 odd years since I first experienced it. It now is mostly under control despite a relatively stressful life, but in the past few years I noticed the following pattern: whenever I am exposed to prolonged social interaction (e.g. Christmas holidays, away days with work, being out with friends for many hours) I become overwhelmed and end up having an anxiety attack. It's like my brain can only deal with stimuli for x hours, past which it goes into overdrive.
Today I had a full day training session and it was very interesting but also jam packed with info. By lunch time I had to go and hide in the toilet to do some meditation. At end of the day I ran the 5 miles to the train station which made me feel a little bit better, but eventually anxiety caught up with me (dizziness, ears ringing, nausea, the works).

Anybody also experiences this and knows if it has a name? I find it so difficult to explain to other people.",10Jul2019,1
109,"I took an out of state trip to the wilderness. My parents signed me up for some excursion program and it was supposed to help me find myself. Well, I put the work in and it kinda did I think. I’m 23 days sober from everything. I left behind a short lived adderall/prescription stimulant phase fairly easily, I left behind several years of minor cannabis usage, and a nicotine dependence, and have also likely permanently damaged my brain with (varying from every few weeks to months, from oct-March, including a stupidly desperate cry for help with an attempt at self-harm) frequent mdma usage. 

I’ve experienced some detrimental effects from my drug usage, mostly over this past year. Been doing too much experimenting, but I’m smart. I recognize that. I hate the debilitating effects drugs have had on my brain. 

I damaged my prefrontal cortex. I can’t always think well in the moment. You can probably draw assumptions as to how that’s affected me. I might have ruined my ability to communicate by speech. I have a difficult time remembering things. I couldn’t skateboard as I wasn’t coordinated enough. I couldn’t join the freestyle battles between my friends. 

Much more than that, but I’m at 1% trying to get this out. It’s only been 23 days since I’ve gone cold turkey. I want to go back to nicotine only, now. 
I want to quit everything else forever. 
Can I recover?

110,"Alright so, I just wanted to talk about the borderline inappropriate and loud everything that's me.

I don't know why I act so weird when I'm  """"""stressed""'"". I think about suicide and have 'the depression voice'. But anyway, once, when I was doing my math homework (something that I struggle with) I became very """"stressed"""" and frustrated. I talked to my mom in a loose voice, as if I was drunk or something. I don't remember anything more except that I was acting really weird and talked about random stuff I thought of.

I guess I'll talk about the present now, cause I just talked to my ""friends"" and was acting that way. I talked about going to the woods so that ""I'd get buttfucked by an old man"", was very aggressive towards a guy (he's always rude towards me, tells me to shut the fuck up when I talk to my friend in the GC, and basically acts like an asshole to me) I told him shit like 'you think you're cool so you tell me to stfu, but in reality you're really fucking sad' (pretty obvious that it's my insecurities coming out), and just overused exclamations and question marks. 

something I texted, an example of the overuse : ""WHATATEGJFBJS!!!!?????!?!????????"" 

I get really angry too, like right now, when I was trying to draw but the paper was pretty bad. It was really smudged when I used an eraser and I hit myself to calm down (I do that).

I think I'm pretty unstable these last two years. I'm way too open, I talk about how my classmates from elementary school used to grope me and ask for me to show them my chest. I tell about how a guy from another class rubbed his you know what on my backside. I act as if these stories are jokes and stuff, ""And then he PINCHED my ass! Like what the fuck? Back off, dude, Hahaha""

And then there's my mom. Lord. I think she's pretty emotionally abusive. She puts a lot of weight on me. My two older brothers didn't graduate the high school I'm currently attending and she constantly says that I have to never, ever double a grade. Math is a difficult thing for me. I struggle with it, and when I tell her ""I got a 4/10"" she looks disappointed and sometimes says ""What can I even say? Dumbass."" I sometimes annoy her on purpose, because I'm a cunt lol and I like attention (when I was little whenever I cried, noone would comfort me), and one time, I was applying lip balm and was smacking my lips, at one point I was really trying to spread the lip balm while she was reading something for me. She suddenly took my lip balm and threw it on the wall, I gasped and said she was ""fucking insane"" and left.

Yesterday night, my hair got stuck to my bed. She was in my room at the time and tried to get my hair out. I was annoyed before she even started and she kept saying stuff about me, that I don't remember, and so I jerked and the piece, that my hair got stuck to, fell off. She got mad (I don't remember what she did), and I told her that I hated living with her. That she always gets mad at me for everything.

I'm looking back at this and, quite frankly, I acted retarded. I'm a brat, you don't know how I act so you'd probably say something like ""No you don't, you're just human"" or something.

111,"First of all, im sorry for any typos, english isnt my first language.

Last year, i had my first dream of this kind, i felt asleep and instantly dreamed in first person, in the same bed i fell asleep, that i was suffocating.

I woke up in sweats after 2 minutes.

I also have to admit, its not really a terror like feel, but its the closest i can get to it because its unexplainable.

In the first day i had it i smoked weed. (wasnt my first time , smoked for a year before it happened)

Since then, it happened more and more often. 

Dreams, in wich i was dissaciociated with my body, couldnt control it, with that same feel going thru my body.

Like a paralysing panic, mixed with terror.

But a few nights ago it happened again , and somehow i could get close enough to bite my arm as deep as i could , before losing control of my body again, all my muscles flexing and me screeching uncontrolably.

I woke up with the bite-mark and now im terrified to sleep again.

Also have to note, when i would go to sleep scared it would happen more often, or when i was more tired, but it would happen on normal occasions too.

Im really scared, that i lose control of myself at night, and those werent dreams, just me in a very, unexplainable state.

As in losing control of my body, i dont mean doing normal stuff without my will, i mean hitting walls, hitting myself, stumbling my body everywhere.

Even though i always woke up back in my bed, that bite mark still has me terrified.

I am here to ask a question, rant and possibly answer my own. It sucks to have one of the most understudied mental disorder: compulsive lying. It sucks because nobody really knows the source of where it comes from and how you get it. That being said; it's hard to stop it.

I run away in the middle of the night and don't tell my family. Got 850 miles away. Drove from South Texas through Oklahoma and Kansas, to Eastern Nebraska in two days. Stayed in my car. Stayed on the couch of someone I only knew from the internet. Rented a room in a house with strange guys from craigslist. Got screwed out of that and given the wrong date for move out. Had to leave asap. Rented a room in another house sight unseen. Hoarder lady. Cat shit in a room. No cat. Doors don't lock on the house. Random people show up and drop things off for my landlady. I have no idea who they are, they just walk in and leave shit. Can't find/afford anything else.

Hail every spring. Ice/snow in winter. Icy roads I'm not used to driving on. Scared of the environment all the time. Car engine dies that fall. Sink my savings into having to buy another car off craigslist. Can't afford to be without a car. Had gotten a better paying job at a call center during this year, but still struggling.

Resume brief homelessness and stress of recovering after fire #2. Red cross offers no help to even transport me anywhere because I have 2 dogs. My phone is in the burned building. I have no family or friends nearby. I don't even have shoes on. Mental state falls apart. Can't take time off work long due to money. Cause problems with boss/at work due to emotional instability/unwillingness to take a schedule change. Boss says I should bring him a doctors note saying I have problems.

117,"Hey, everyone.  After laying in bed all day, I finally decided to reach out.  I’m new to this sub, and this is my first post.

I’ve worked full-time since I was 18.  I also started college that year.  I am now 26.

Long story short, I started as a full-time student, got burned out, dropped to part-time, and finished an associate degree in 4 years.  Then, to finish my bachelors degree, I enrolled in an accelerated degree program (35 hours out of class homework, one class at a time, meeting from 6p-10p once a week).

There would be days I would work for 10 hours, go to class, and then work on homework until 1am, only to leave for work 8 hours later.  I averaged 4 hours of sleep a night for the last 7 weeks of Capstone.

The last 8 years (for a 4-year degree, mind you) have been a clawing fight to the top.

And then I graduated a month ago.

My hobbies that I love and craved time to do during my time in college no longer excite me.  Even with more free time, I’m less social than I was.  I give myself a hard time for not having a new job yet, considering my experience and degree (over-qualified for entry level, but businesses around here only promote from within, so...)

It’s a never-ending cycle.

I just want to be happy again.  I want to not obsess over my resume for 6-10 hours on my scarce days off.  I want to not treat my friends that I sacrificed time with like they’re burdens for wanting to see me.  I want to be able to write, draw, play video games, and exercise again.

I feel like I’m in a void and can’t get out.

Any advice would be appreciated.

Thank you for your time.",10Jul2019,1
118,"I want nothing more than for this to be authentic. I want nothing more than to be real with myself. I cant figure out what's wrong with me. I google it and I get ""perfectionist"", but when I read the results I know that's not it. I'm not a perfectionist, but I strive to be perfect in a way I can't articulate. I want to be lazy and then my brain comes in and says ""time to be perfect."" ""Do everything as if you're the perfect human"". But i know that the perfect human doesn't exist. Moments later I feel like I've stopped being as perfect as I want to be, so I give up. I go back to being my ""normal"" self. To be my normal isn't good enough. There's only two sides of me in my head: lazy &amp; perfect. I want to find that middle ground. I want to change

 I've had this problem since I was at least in the 5th grade. I don't remember why I started but I remember how it started. I would start my ""perfect"" life my saying to myself   ""\[my name here\] the perfect daughter"", as if I was on a tv show and everyone was watching me. I was never taught that I had to be perfect. My parents loved me just the way I was. I remember doing homework that had to be perfect and if I gave up the ""perfect act"" I would throw away everything I did while I was ""perfect"" so that I could start over whenever I decided to be perfect again.

 I don't remember when I stopped saying that to myself, but it was probably high school. This turned into be telling myself to ""stop being lazy"" and it's like my life flipped a switch, but I was never surprised if the switch flipped back by the end of the day. I control my switch, I tell it when to turn to perfect and when to turn to lazy, but I can't seem to get it to stay in the middle at normal. I still say ""stop"" to myself. There's so many times I've flipped on my ""perfect"" switch thinking that I would never flip it back, but it always flips back. I always give up on my perfect self. 

Even while I'm writing this I feel like I'm changed and I'm going to stay this way, but I bet that by the end of the day I'll flip my switch back and rip this paper out of my journal. When I started writing this I was only writing for myself, but now I think I need help further. I've been to therapy, and she had no idea what was wrong with me. So here's where I ask you.

120,"Im on mobile and english isnt my first language so sorry in advance. I have several things Id like an opinion for, so huge thanks to anyone who might find time to help me! I havent really posted on reddit before so please tell me if im doing something wrong or should post this elsewhere.

I have problems with my health, both mental and physical, and have been getting help for them for years. Depression, anxiety, add-like problems, sleep problems, possible personality disorder, thyroid problems... I take medication (sertraline, thyroxin) that help me with some of them, and havent actually been suicidal for years which is obviously great. My biggest problem at the moment is the bone-deep exhaustion that prevents me from doing much of anything more than a few times a week.

I recently had a psychological evaluation, and some of the things he said made sense, others less so. There has obviously been some hiccups in my upbringing but i dont have any traumas or ptsd or anything. I have huge trouble with my emotions, yknow, managing, expressing, recognizing them etc. The psychologist agrees, and its a thing i have been working on in therapy. One thing he said that really bothered me was that i sometimes appear insincere. That i dont seem believable when i talk about my problems. He still agreed that i obviously have problems but the whole exchange left me kind of disappointed and super anxious. I havent lied or exaggerated during the tests at all, i actually made sure to be completely honest even if it was something i didnt want to say. The doctor and the nurse ive been seeing from the same establishment also have said similar things. They both praised me for seeming much more real and genuine during one appointment when i actually was on a very good mood, still exhausted and going on four hours of sleep, but more relaxed and positive than usual. 

The question is, am i being 'crazy' for being bothered by this? Is this just some undiagnosed personality disorder doing some overthinking? I admit im very sensitive to not being believed or taken seriously due to some difficult things in the past, but am i overreacting? I get nervous in situations like these so i guess i may appear odd, but i have explained this to them. I smile alot and laugh a bit too much and while i can keep it normal in regular social situations even with strangers, it goes overboard when im nervous, talking to doctors etc. I feel im very different in other situations, but youd think a mental health professionals should understand patient being nervous. So do i just seem even crazier than i think?

The other thing id like an opinion is this. Several professionals have told me in the past that i seem immature for my age, and act younger than i am. Im 26 right now. I do agree, but what exactly can i do to become more mature? Due to my problems i havent been able to finish any education and have no job experience. Im ashamed of this and am behind my peers in many things, but i just really dont know what to do. I know i need to take more responsibility of my life but i cant just will my exhaustion and anxiety away. My depression is better than in years, but other problems still remain. Im pretty poor but i get by, rent a nice apartment, have a few friends and get along well with my family, so i do have some good things in my life too.

My therapist is on a vacation and my next appointment for the nurse is a month away, and i cant really talk to anyone about these things in depth, hence reddit. If anyone made it to the end of this boring rant, thank you! I would really appreciate it if anyone had any advice to give.

121,"Hi all, 

So from last year I had my first anxiety attack and it really freaked me out and I mean really scared me and from then on I have looked up things online and came across numerous things. Firstly I thought I had MS and I was obsessed with this for about 2 months and been to doctors and hospital about it also and it came back that it was all anxiety causing the feelings I had. Then one day I looked up ocd, anxiety and I then came across schizophrenia and ever since then I have genuinely been terrified of developing it. My symptoms of the obsession have been , what if someone was out to get me, what if I did hear voices, what if my family hate me and don’t want me here and just put up with me, what if someone bugged my car and all of these thoughts have came from months and months of looking up schizophrenia symptoms and stories and hearing that you get it in early teens and now I’m 24. I have had amazing days very recently of not worrying about it and then all of a sudden I could have a crazy thought like “what if my work are just keeping me on because they feel sorry for me” or watching a movie and thinking what if they really want to hurt each other in real life but put on an act in the movie to like each other. I honestly know this is all rubbish but my anxiety and mind can be so strong sometimes that I need to look on the internet to clear my mind and I always say to my self 3 times everything will be okay because this number is a number I feel safe with so I say I’ll be okay I don’t have schizophrenia I say it 3 times and I feel slightly better. Please, I’d love to hear your replies and stories guys. I know it’s a long rant but I would really appreciate it.

122,"I’ll start by saying I can definitely be a likeable person in the right situations. I do much better in 1 on 1 situations compared to big groups. The best way for me to get someone to like me/understand me is for them to spend time with me... sometimes it has to be a lot of time. 

But there are aspects of my personality and other features that I feel genuinely impact my impression on others, especially first impressions. I have trouble creating conversations, as my brain freezes in these types of situations. I find it very hard to figure out what I want to say unless prompted by someone else. I’m very much a responder rather than an initiator.

This has made social interactions extremely difficult throughout most of my life. No one seems to want to talk to someone who can’t keep a conversation moving. My brain doesn’t naturally create long and winding stories or responses to questions. I’m succinct and straightforward. You ask me a question, I answer it simply because I don’t want to waste your time. I don’t want to feel like I’m an attention hog. I am so overly self aware that I have to be self aware of how self aware I am. I also have to make sure people don’t think I’m rude or arrogant.

These types of flaws in my viewpoint of myself has also led to negative observations of how others view me. When I’m in a room of people and someone is talking, Let’s say they’re giving a presentation, I will notice who they look at as they talk. I will then notice that they don’t ever make eye contact with me. I’ll also keep track of who participates and realize I’m the only one who hasn’t raised my hand to speak. I think my voice sounds strange and weak and that other people can feel my anxiety as I try to overcome my own social awkwardness. When I’m walking with a group of people I am almost always dragging behind everyone,  not really participating or being invited to participate in the conversation. I will often try to butt into conversations as a way to include myself only to be practically ignored as those who were talking continue to exclude me. 

The hardest part for me is that I’m trying. I’m trying to talk to others. I’m trying to include myself. I want to be social with people and have them like me and I don’t think that’s a bad thing. People say you shouldn’t worry about people liking you, but when you perceive most people as not liking you, that advice seems insulting. Being liked is part of the human experience, and I objectively feel like most people don’t like me. I’m quiet and shy and even my friends comment on this all the time. I’m the quiet guy in the group. All my friends do like me, but that’s because they’ve taken the time to get to know me. Without this, I feel unable to make good first impressions. I feel inferior to others, and I also feel my slightly chunky body and kinda large head has made it even harder for others to look at me and want to talk to me. Like today I met with an attractive male coworker and a random female supervisor who had never met either of us before. The whole time I just walked behind them as they chatted away. We did a mock interview as a group, and she just looked at him the entire time she spoke. It was like I wasn’t even there. It hurts a lot to be excluded like that. 

So how do I get over this? I feel my views are objectively true as I’ve analyzed myself from the viewpoints of others over and over and over again and always come to the same result: I’m unlikeable. Just looking for some advice, thanks all. 

P.s. I’m safe and doing good besides my low self esteem.",10Jul2019,2

New to the sub reddit and love what appears to be happening here. I'm most passionate about helping myself and others heal and thrive in the world, and this sub appears to be the best place I've seen for that for people who have had mental health issues.

For me personally, I worked for an impossible boss to the point of burnout. I'll call it micro-misabusive-management. It was perhaps the worst experience of my lifetime.

A quick highlight of the things that I dealt with from the manager:

 - When completing a project that was supposed to take weeks to complete and I was held responsible for by others, changing my assignment daily or weekly so I could never finish

 - Denying that the initial assignments ever occurred

 - Blatantly lying about facts about my performance, events that happened, etc. in a way that undermined my credibility

 - When my project got criticism, telling everyone I was acting alone and should include him on decisions (even when I was following an order)

 - When my project got praise, him taking the credit (common)

 - Blamed me for problems that had nothing to do with me

 - Telling me I'm unconfident, indecisive, don't work fast enough, first privately and then publicly after it started becoming true as I became negative and started hating my job. (A few co workers eventually followed along, telling me I had become unconfident, indecisive, and not working fast enough)

 - Trust me, that's a short sample

My job was to work with another team of people, so the constant public humiliation and shaming was really damaging to my ability to perform my job, especially once he got others to start agreeing with him as I burned out. 

Essentially, I was set up to fail and forced to fail. This wasn't like sales where I have my work cut out for me and management matters little, this was a creative job where I'm evaluated by my manager to do what my manager tells me to do. I was a formerly passionate, excited, and dedicated employee who only saw the good in people, and that part of me was ""killed"" by the ongoing abusive management of this boss, my eventual realization of how consistent and purposeful this was, the burnout, and the resulting loss.

This is now about half a year behind me. After a very, very hard time, I can finally see the light. I want very badly to be able to recover from this better and stronger than ever, but I just don't know how. 

It's difficult for me to trust people because I initially trusted by nefarious boss. It's difficult for me to get motivated because my previous motivation led to my burnout. It's difficult for me to want to work again because work appears to me like it will just be more abuse.

I know all of these relationships are not set in stone, but I can't get around how I feel about them. The emotion is still there. It still hurts. I'm still scared. 

Creative jobs are all like this, where relationships matter and there are no objective criteria, so I'm still terrified of this work experience happening again. I feel like if it did it would break me and the next recovery would be 2x as long. I want to switch jobs or industries, but I have no clear path and I'm still blocked by some lingering anxiety as well as low energy levels that make career rediscovery, training, and transition an extremely unattractive (nauseating) notion.

I have enough money for at least another year, so I'm not forced to do anything right now and I'm not facing immediate homelessness (thank you, God, for having mercy on my soul 🙏).

I'm just unclear on what to do now. How do I use this time wisely to improve my mental health? How do I use it to create healthy and strong career prospects?

Has anyone taken a career break (or life break) out of mental health necessity? What did you do and how did you get back on track?

Thank you so much for your time.",10Jul2019,2

127,"I've had symptoms of depression since 2016. They've gotten progressively worse up until this year.

Recently I have much more so been dealing with fits and honestly rage isn't the right word. I get them when I am incredibly stressed (which would be a normal persons normal amount of stress, but I cry due to the slightest amount)

If I get put into a stressful situation I cant help myself out of everything becomes to much for me and I start literally screaming. Screaming, crying, shaking and eventually also hurting myself. I can barely but not really control what I do in these fits and I most definitely can't think.

So they seem like rage fits but rage certainly is never the reason

I am constantly stressed and always feel like I need rest.

Any idea what this is? Or at least what these are called?

(Further info: I'm 16, troubled family life. I have suspected bpd but I am not at all diagnosed despite reaching out to doctors (not therapists). Mental illness does run in my family. I do have birth control (vaginal ring) since the beginning of the year, which did affect my mood.)",10Jul2019,1

I feel like the Nick Carraway to every Gatsby

or the Ned to every peter Parker.

I met up with my friends and for the past few times we hung out, everything just seems different.

They started dating some guy, then my other friend is moving towns. They're both leaving town. Even if they weren't leaving, something is off. It's like, when you buy the off brand of your favorite drink. The one who started dating some guy; she doesn't really want us to meet. I've brought it up, a couple of times but she dismisses it. I feel like, maybe she doesn't want me to meet him?

I'm a trans guy, so there's some things that I experience (or don't experience) that is typical of the regular dude. I look like a dude, sound like a dude, smell like a dude, for the most part, act like a dude, but I was never socialized like a dude, and I never got to experience high school like everyone else. I never got to date. I still don't know how. I have to hide my voice, my voice change, my medication, my wardrobe and just about everything about my identity around my parents, because they've already shown me that they don't love me for who I really am.

I feel so other when I meet up with my friends, because though I've changed physically, I'm still the high school kid. I'm still the geek who loves science. I still don't open up emotionally, no matter how hard I try. I still like talking about crazy ideas for shows and weird inventions. I still even look like I kid (I get told I look like i'm 15 instead of the 19 that I am).

They're growing up and they're more into talking about their day to day lives and despite living a day to day life as well, I can't relate. They like to tell me about their future plans and what they want to do, but it feels like, I'm always just the one listening. When I have news, I feel like they don't get what I'm talking about. it makes me so sad.

... I want to fall in love. I would literally die if I was someone's first choice. I'd love to go on a big adventure, and save the day, and get the girl or guy, like a super hero or something. I'm sure that's everyone. I wish I'd get to do something amazing with myself. I wish I was loved. I wish I was special and actually worth something. I'm sure that's everyone and I feel stupid now for complaining about it. I wish I was actually intelligent enough to be geeky, or strong enough to be fit, or musically inclined enough to be a musician. but I'm not. I'm just me, stuck in a wave of average with an unimpressive life, and no mark to leave on the people around me.

God I wish I could save people.",10Jul2019,6
131,"Feel like my mind is just giving myself “therapy” all day thinking about my problems, emotional abuse from others, bad ways I cope, etc. I keep trying to solve them or rehearse the way I will deal with people in my life, but I need to stop and focus on my work.",10Jul2019,1
132,"My friend, curious of my opinion on the matter since she knows I have suffered from depression and anxiety, asked me my opinion on therapy and antidepressants.  She stated that she does not feel either are the answer and that through friends, family, and fixing the issue in life that is causing the distress, one should be able to overcome depression.  She mentioned our mutual friend who also has depression and essentially said, ""If she's depressed why doesn't she just make more friends? She does nothing to fix the problems she has."" I see her point, in an ideal world this would be the solution, but it is not that easy for everyone.  I told her it is hard to explain it to her since she has never experienced mental illness, her response being that she has when her father passed away.  I then explained to her that she went through/is going through seemingly normal grief, not clinical depression, which she seemed to understand.  She is a relatively positive, energetic and extroverted person, so it is difficult for me to explain that not everyone can just overcome their problems like she seemingly can.",10Jul2019,1
133,"Sorry for the very long/ranty post... Hopefully the kind souls reading this can help me untangle all these things going through my mind. 

TW: self-image issues, body dysmorphia, suicidal thoughts.

I (25 F) have been feeling really down lately and want to feel good again. It's been so long since I haven't felt ok with myself that I hardly remember what it feels like, and that scares me. 

A bit of context (list of things that are not exactly helping me feel better): basically I'm a second year dental student in a tough school. As for my family background: My dad is VERY controlling. He controls me financially because I can't work while in dental school (controlling to the point of forcing me to visit our home country for 2 months every summer, even though he knows I hate it and would love to be able to decide what I do in the summer because it's pretty much the only time I would be able to work and gain a bit of financial independence or just relax &amp; do what I want to do). But he pays my school fees, so I don't really have much financial freedom now, although I am moving out this year thanks to the financial aid I will be receiving from my uni.  

I keep a lot of secrets from him. He's Muslim and he doesn't know I have a boyfriend (and would probably disown me if he found out). He travels a lot for business so I don't see him a lot during the year.  My mom has schizophrenia (unmedicated) and is living on her own in my home country. She is no longer really with my dad, and he doesn't care about her. He only sends her money sometimes because I got mad and yelled at him for not giving a shit about her. She doesn't believe she's ill / needs meds &amp; she resists every effort to get her to take meds. The only option I have is filing a court order to gain legal custody of her, which is VERY hard and long to do in my home country &amp; none of my relatives there will help with the process (I've cut contact with many of them for this reason), so I'm pretty much at a deadlock and have learned to cope with her illness, although I still get sad when I think of her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the other things weighing on my mind:  My uni program encourages perfectionism, and most of the feedback I (and many others) get from faculty and other students is very negative. This is understandable because you need a certain degree of perfectionism to excel, but sometimes it's just completely out of hand and some supervisors seem to go out of their way to break you down. I love dentistry, but being surrounded by negative feedback isn't really helping me feel good on a daily basis. 

Also, it's a highly competitive program and I'm a hard worker, and I don't hide it well (at my school, if you look like you're trying hard, other students hold grudges against you and go out of their way to ostracize you from the rest of the group so that they can feel they somehow have the upper hand). Again, I know it comes with the territory of dental school, but I don't exactly feel welcome or liked among my classmates. Here are a few examples to illustrate how I feel/am treated at school (feel free to skip over them): 

((((- Earlier this year I joined a reading/note-taking group with a few other students in an attempt to make a few friends and help each other out in this harsh environment. However, a lot of people in the reading group seemed to take advantage of me. For example, I would share all the notes and cram sheets I got from the upper years with the reading group, but I found out that the other people in the group were sharing really good documents among each other and not telling me about them, putting me at a disadvantage. (I found out because I heard them whispering about it thinking I wasn't listening). I'm a fair person and this kind of secrecy really hurt me. When I gently brought it up to the ""group leader"" and said I would like to be ""in on"" these extra documents he basically replied, ""Oh yeah?"" with a little grin and started talking to someone else. 

Oh yeah, and the people in this reading group are some of the ""nicer"" people in the class.

\-There was a mentally ill student in my class this year, and he was doing strange things due to his psychosis, and people were being really nasty to him (laughing at him behind his back, giving him dirty looks in class instead of offering him help). I asked the reading group if we could share notes with him, and the other members basically said no because they thought he was ""lazy and didn't deserve to be bailed out"" (clearly they don't understand mental illness). Anyways, when I saw people belittling him I stood up for him &amp; explained to them that his behaviour isn't a laughing matter &amp; that it's due to mental illness and isn't his fault, but my classmates have been a lot colder to me ever since (not that they were particularly kind to begin with).

\-&amp; this seems trivial but it's just a confirmation that people in my class don't really like me:  let's face it, social media is a barometer of popularity: people in my class like each other's dumbest posts on social media, some people's profile pics get liked by the entire faculty of dentistry, but whenever I post anything or even change my profile pic, almost nobody likes it. That's kind of like the times when I would speak up in class to answer a question or during a group project &amp; I would say something I thought was useful, and ppl would ignore it but then when someone else said the same thing in different words, people would praise the other person and agree with the idea. You get the jist...

etc.  )))))

Another thing that has been weighing on me is comparing myself to other women, especially in terms of looks. A bit of background on that: 

\- I was cheated on in my last two long-term relationships and I don't feel like I've fully gotten over that. The first time I was cheated on, my emotionally (&amp; sometimes physically) abusive ex threatened to retaliate or commit suicide if I left, which scarred me. He also told me that his close male friend said that I looked good but that the ""other girl"" (who at the time was supposedly ""just a friend"") looked better. After the betrayal, the 'other girl"" actually went up to me in person and told me that he didn't actually want me. All this really hurt me and I've never quite been able to see myself as beautiful ever since. I stopped letting people take my picture (I even skipped my last 2 graduations because I didn't want pictures taken of me) and I developed an eating disorder for a while (which I've mostly overcome). Since then, I still feel that there are so many things I would like to change about my physical appearance and I'm extremely insecure and often compare myself to other girls. 

\-as a girl in my program, in order to get good notes and advice from the upper years, you need to look attractive. Girls in my program tend to sabotage each other (even in the upper years) and it's always wiser to ask guys for notes, as they tend to be more honest, but it comes at a price. They will literally ignore you if you're not dressed up or wearing makeup. I've even seen cases where girls have asked guys for notes and been denied when the guys learned they weren't single. I've asked a (supposedly kind) guy for advice about my lab work but I was wearing sweatpants and no makeup, and he ROLLED HIS EYES at me, vs when the girl next to me in lab (always wearing makeup, heels, and revealing clothing) asked him the same questions, he spent an hour giving her feedback. It's an environment where girls are pitted against each other to compete for male attention. Sometimes the upper years even ""rate"" girls out loud. It doesn't help that all the girls play into this. They all dress up and almost always wear a full face of makeup to school, do their hair, post sexy pictures on social media, etc. I've been comparing myself to other women a lot lately and have been feeling really crappy about myself and my perceived flaws. 

\-There's a particularly unpleasant girl who sits next to me in the lab (the one mentioned above). I compare myself a lot to her physically, and a lot of it is because she's always quick to point out my flaws. Ex: last year during finals I hadn't slept a lot and it showed on my face (dark circles and a bit of acne) but I wanted to look a bit more alive so I wore a bit of lipstick to school. She came up to me and told me ""your lipstick matches your acne"". She does things like this a lot. If I style my hair differently for example, she'll come up to me and ask me if there's a special event I'm going to ""because you normally look like trash and this is a nice change"". She is extremely competitive and is part of the reason I can't get too close to a lot of other girls in my class (because she's friends with them and I don't see myself faking friendship with her just to be close to the other girls, a lot of whom are also overtly hostile with me). 

\-I've never had very high self-esteem, but before I was cheated on, I was actually starting to feel really good about myself and starting to express myself through my clothes and feel attractive. The cheating really shattered me, and it's been at least 7 years since I haven't felt attractive enough to even be in photos. I've been trying to feel good about myself again but it seems that every effort I've put into feeling more attractive/expressing my personal style more has been met with a lot of backlash. For example: 

I have a boyfriend (whom I love &amp; have been with for about 4 years). He's a funny and sweet guy but he doesn't like what I wear all the time (my personal style is more hipstery/colourful than his) and he often encourages me to dress more ""casually"" when we go out together or to see his friends, and I see what he means &amp; acknowledge that sometimes more ""casual/form-flattering"" clothes do suit me better, but other times it annoys me that he doesn't agree with my personal style and has, in the past, told me to draw inspiration from how one of his female friends dresses. (This was very triggering for me, as this girl is very image-obsessed and she's all about how she'll look in the online photos she stages, etc). 

\--I'm a bit insecure in my current relationship too, due to the possibility of being cheated on and I compare myself to a girl he used to date (who was very image-obsessed, very thin, and who LOVES male attention &amp; has slept with his entire group of friends (not exaggerating), including my boyfriend). The first time I met her, she was with group of his friends and my boyfriend took me to meet all of them. Before I could even say hello, she basically went up to him, not even looking at me, and whispered in his ear and stood really close to him RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME, and they whispered like that the whole time. This was years ago. I confronted him about it after and he apologized, but the image still pops up in my mind when I'm feeling down. He says he doesn't talk to her anymore, and I want to believe him, but I don't check his phone or whatnot so I can't truly know. All I know is that last year, he opened his Instagram in front of me to show me a post by some guy and her name was the first to pop up when he started typing in the search bar, meaning he had searched for her recently  or frequently. I confronted him about it and he reassured me. I moved on but it sometimes lingers in the back of my mind. I don't know if it's just me but sometimes I feel like he gets excited by female attention (from women that are not me, like when we go out in public. Again, maybe that's normal for committed guys; I just don't know.). 

\- also, I've caught him ogling pictures of Instagram ""models"". Earlier this summer he sent me a picture of one such ""model"" wearing a dress he thought would look good on me, but that really triggered me because it was an old photo of that girl (she had posted it 2 years ago), which means he had to scroll her profile to find it, so he was clearly checking her out. He gave me 3 conflicting excuses as to how he ""stumbled"" on her page (she isn't exactly known for being the best-dressed model out there; she's known for bikini pics and the like), and he finally admitted that he was checking her out. Anyways, I know she's not really a threat to me but I still didn't like how that made me feel. 

My other solution to feeling down has been to try to make friends bc I feel like I don't have any TRUE friends to confide in (in or outside of uni). I have a few friends that are really sweet and fun, but I can't always count on them when I need them, and sometimes they even bring me down (like I have this one appearance-obsessed friend who will take pictures of me without my consent and make remarks like ""you could use a rhinoplasty"" or ""your smile is crooked"", etc, which doesn't really help my self-esteem at all. 

\- I've tried to make a few friends in the upper years . I confided that I felt insecure due to this pressure to look good in an upper-year guy whom I considered a friend and who at first sight didn't seem to play into this whole ""attractiveness competition"" at school (because he has a girlfriend so I assumed he was legit). I told him I want to enhance my appearance just to ""get it over with"" and to stop it from weighing on my mind all the time. He told me ""no offense, but you look VERY average. Your boyfriend is better looking than you. Don't get anything done or else you'll be FAKE. There's a ton of girls in my class who are gorgeous and they're natural."" (he said the thing about my boyfriend half-jokingly but it didn't feel funny at all). Also, it's not exactly true. My boyfriend and I are about the same in terms of attractiveness. Anyways, I digress. 

\-Objectively and rationally, I know I'm not an ugly person, but sometimes there's an evil little voice in my mind that has me thinking ""I'm attractive enough to get a man, but am I attractive enough to KEEP him?"". A lot of guys seem to be interested in me but that has never really made me feel particularly good about myself. My solution to these insecurities has been to seek therapy and to get a some aesthetic procedures done to at least comfort myself that I'm doing all I can so I stop worrying about it. I have an appointment for such procedures scheduled soon. In order to get these procedures done (and as backup financial resources for when I move out), I took out a student line of credit (because there's no way my dad is going to pay for these things), which I will pay off once I graduate. Anyways, the prospect of improving my appearance through surgery &amp; procedures has been my little silver lining for a few months now. It gives me hope but simultaneously feels unpleasant to think about because there are many things I want done (from lash extensions to jaw contouring). 

 Today, I told my dad that I would be flying out of town next week (and staying for 4 days) to get a few things done and that I would pay for everything myself with my line of credit. He wanted me to travel to another city with him and my brother (but I didn't want to go because they are so stressful to be around, and we always fight. My brother always picks fights with me and threatens me). Anyways, so my dad met my plan with a lot of resistance and said that I'm stupid for taking out a student loan and he doesn't believe I'll ever be able to pay off or ever amount to anything (even though all evidence proves the contrary: I always pass my classes, I've had scholarships in the past, I'm in dental school and doing pretty well (and I actually have an interest in the field), etc. This feels like a way to manipulate me into doing exactly what he wants at all times. He often uses verbal abuse as a way to guilt me into doing things, and when that doesn't work, he insults me or tries to find other ways to get me where he wants me to be, and I've only started to recognize that recently.

His words still hurt and angered me. It feels like whenever I try to move forward/ move in a direction that fulfills my desires in life, I am met with hostility from the people around me, and it seems like people are constantly trying to put me down. I'm constantly angry and sad. I sometimes wish I could just die. I'm tired of feeling like crap. I WANT to feel good; I WANT to have real friends. I WANT people around me who have my best interests at heart, people who are on my side and who are genuine. All I know is I want to move forward, but I don't know where to start to get myself out of this dark place and just feel comfortable in my own skin and able to advance peacefully/make peace with my past. Where would you start? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: 

I have low self-esteem and constantly compare myself to other girls. I'm also in a university environment where looks are everything and I'm insecure about my appearance also because I've been cheated on in the past. I'm from an emotionally unsupportive family and I've been feeling really depressed lately and am trying to feel better, but it feels like whenever I take a step forward or try to do something that will get me out of this dark place (suicidal thoughts, hopelessness, poor self-image), the people around me are unsupportive. I don't know where to start in order to feel better. Where would you start?
