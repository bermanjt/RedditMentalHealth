0,I finally got some help. I went to the doctor and I’m starting antidepressants tomorrow. I also am on a wait list to see a counselor. I hope it will help me,23May2019,11
1,"So when I was 14 years old i lived in a pretty ghetto area,i had little friends until one day this Teenage boy moved in, we started talking and i ended up really liking him, we didn't start necessarily dating but one day we were kissing and he took me over to this secluded area and attempted to have sex with me and I was not interested, I told him to stop and that it hurt but he kept continuing to do this, I ended up going home and after that for the next 3 weeks he made fun of me to everyone and called me ""dry"" because he couldn't get it in and he constantly made me feel bad, I still attached to him though because I had no friends, anyways months later hes about to move out and his best friend tells me that he was actually 19 and not 16 like i thought he was, and he wasn't new to the apartments, he just moved back in after he got out of jail, I was shocked but didn't think much of it and now that I'm almost 18 years old im starting to realize that i think i was raped? And I'm really starting to feel like shit about it now, I don't know how to feel :(",23May2019,9
2,"hi, i recently started dating this really nice boy and he treats me really well. it initially took me a while to decide to officially date him mainly bc i’ve noticed a pattern in his behavior w minor inconveniences since we first started talking. i call them “episodes” bc he’d instantly change as soon as they started. 

the first one i encountered was about a month into talking, i expressed to him how something was bothering me (it was something pretty minor and could be fixed if we talked about it) and a few minutes into the conversation he got flustered and began to breathe heavily. the look in his eyes frightened me a bit, his look was extremely different/distant. it was sort of like he began to disassociate. he began to rock back and forth while crying and repeated how much of a shitty person he was for causing me any distress. i was at shock, i was frozen for a bit and didn’t know how to react. he started getting more and more frustrated w himself and started slapping his face and banging his head on the wall. when he started harming himself is when i started to react. i was terrified, i didn’t know what to do (he’s much bigger than me and i had no idea if he was capable of even hurting me also since i didn’t know him that well). i kept telling him to stop and somehow he managed to collect himself after about 10 minutes. he was still crying by the end of it and i comforted him in my arms. but while he was in my arms i still felt really shaken by it. 

he hasn’t had any episode that bad since. however, he’ll still get either extremely mad or sad when little inconveniences come up (ex: school work getting too hard, his computer freezing, or even something as small as a pen running out of ink). w these smaller things he’ll just yell at them or take out his aggression on them. 

the thing is though, 90% of the time he’s a literal ray of sunshine. he’s SO affectionate and full of love to give. 

since the first episode, i’ve told him he should look into getting some help and he’s promised me he would. but he hasn’t. it’s obvious he feels things really strongly bc when he’s happy, he’s EXTREMELY happy, and when he’s upset he’s REALLY upset. i care about him a lot and i’m really worried about this being an issue for the rest of his life. i just have no idea what it could be, would it be a form of anger issues? 

i’d like to also mention that he’s gotten a lot better since we first started talking about handling his episodes. he knows the first time really shook me and he hasn’t gone to that extent since then. i think that’s why i ended up dating him a few months later, i actually saw him trying to get better.",23May2019,2
3,"I’m a 15 f and recently I’ve noticed my decline in my mental health, I’m anger or anxious and I have intrusive thoughts that are getting hard to ignore,  and my past traumatic experiences are getting hard to ignore too. I’m not going to school because I’m to anxious or I’m just incredibly anger to the point where I’ll tighten my jaw to the point of getting a headache, I’m also tired and I have become obsessed with being destructive either to myself or to stuff like building. I don’t want to hurt anyone, and when I do have intrusive thoughts I do a pretty good job at brushing them away, but my head just wants to make me think that people , including my friends, deserve to be victimized. That what I’m thinking isn’t bad, and this point I’m just so tired, I just want to be good again.",23May2019,1
4,"Hi, everyone. I was prescribed Adderall XR 20mg a few weeks ago (as an adult female early 30s), but couldn't for certain report I felt different aside from a slight anxiety-reducing calming effect that went away after 4-5 hours. My MD wanted to up the dose to 30mg at the 2wk mark.

Is it odd that I'm not certain if it's working at this high a dose? I've never used stimulants before but I did use sativa to self-medicate before diagnosis. I would need to ingest twice the amount of the people smoking w/ me to feel the effects. I was thinking it could be bc I'm just extremely dopamine-deficient and need a higher dose? Has anyone else seen a correlation between cannabis use/tolerance and Adderall XR tolerance?

Thanks for you input!",23May2019,1

6,"Hi everyone, I don’t know who to talk to or ask because I’ve just been pushing everyone away, even my family. Recently I got into a drunken argument after a party with my best friend (I am female, he is male). He said some pretty mean things, and the day after, he even texted me that he hates me. Typically I would probably be super sad and angry and idk. I just haven’t been able to feel anything. I haven’t been able to cry, laugh, be mad. I don’t really know what to do. I’m going to talk to him very soon since that night, but I can’t even talk to other people normally without faking my emotions. I guess I’m just writing this as a way to vent, no real questions. Any input is appreciated. Thanks.",23May2019,2
7,"I suspect I may have some form of paranoia.

Whenever I'm alone, regardless of how close the nearest person is, I feel.on edge.

I dont want to say I feel like I'm being watched, but... I dont know how else to say it.

Usually I dont like being alone in my room at night, but my little brother sleeps in my room so I'm usually fine then, but when he isn't, I refuse to sit next to my window.

I live in the woods near a resort, so I obviously know I'm not being watched, but I cant help feeling like i am",23May2019,2
8,"I'm having a weird day today. I'm just having mood swings that are not good. Right now I feel sort of low. I feel overwhelmed by everything.

I went to school today and it felt bad. Today is just one of those days that I wish I could feel the way that some people seem to think mental illnesses are. I wish I could feel the ""Quirky"" or Romanticized version of this. But no I feel like hell and that isn't cool to anyone. I wish this would just not exist",23May2019,1
9,"So I briefly mentioned in a post I made about my (frequent) hallucinations. I'm going to explain this using the IDF (intensity, duration, frequency) curve (used in calculating rainfall), since I can't remember what the exact terminology was for the word I'm looking for...

The intensity of most of these hallucinations are like jumpscares. Moments of intense fright, like a heartbeat skyrocketing. The duration? Most of them last for like half a second or a full second, though some of them last for minutes or even to an hour. The frequency. These hallucinations happen practically daily. I talk in detail about these hallucinations in some of my other posts and comments in other subreddits, but I can give you the run-down.

1. **Shadow in the bathroom**. So, I sometimes spend the night at my grandma's house. Not that big of a deal there. However, at night, when I'm in the bed, I'll look into the bathroom (which is almost always open, and is right across  from the bed), and see this very intimidating shadow. This is the hallucination that lasts for minutes to an hour. It will be a shadow that, if I could give a visual reference, looks quite similar to the Russian Sleep Experiment guy (don't know the actual name of the image), but with the mouth of that one enemy in the Amnesia. The intensity of this hallucination is rather low, best described as ""unsettling."" Frequency? Every time I spend the night at my grandma's house, which is around every 2 days. I'm aware that I could just, y'know, shut the door, but then I'll start seeing the shadow in the hallway or at the foot of my bed.
2. **Arthropods (insects, spiders, centipedes).** Now this is a little common for me since I love insects and unfortunately our house is full of them. The problem is, is that these insects are like brief shadows flying out of the corner of your eye. Sometimes I'll see a spider on the floor or a insect's legs moving when they have been dead for weeks. Whenever a hallucination like this occurs, I get extremely itchy on my head and on my arms. I'll be afraid to scratch because I won't know if it's an actual spider on my head or it's just an itch. Sometimes I'll even hallucinate a spider leg coming down from my head. The intensity of this hallucination is best described as, ""Did I just see that?"" Confusion, slightly alarmed, but not scared. The duration is half a second, mostly. The frequency is about every day.
3. **Voices in the mind and outside**. This is an auditory hallucination. This usually involves me hearing a noise, such as a clang in the other room, a shifting noise in another room, sometimes I'll hear someone call out, ""Hey!"" but no one else is with me. Sometimes I'll hear my name being called. I experienced Exploding Head Syndrome twice before (in the same night) and it scared the living daylights out of me. I've heard gibberish whispering at night, with a lot of S's and O's, These sounds are outside of my head. Now let's get into my head. Most of the time, these voices call out to me when I'm stressed or having a mental breakdown. They don't sound like any voice in particular. In fact, think of a crowd of voices hissing in hushed tones. That's what I hear. They're malicious, or having malicious intent. I've described in a journal entry (I write in a journal) about what these voices tell me when I'm under stress, and here's a miniature list:  
""Go to a mental ward!""  
""Tell them! Tell them!"" Them being my parents, my brother, etc.  
""Ask them! Ask them!""  
""Tell them to take you to a mental ward!""  
""You deserve to go to a hospital!""  
""Call the police! Call the police!""  
""They won't believe you!""  
""Go ahead! Do it! DO IT!"" When I'm having a mental breakdown, I'll become suicidal. This suicidal period lasts until the breakdown is over.  
These voices are in my head, and I'm well aware that I could shut them up, I've tried. They keep coming back. However, recently, I did hear something a little different from them. It was a single...something. It wasn't a voice, but I knew it was something. It didn't say a thing. It was like it appeared in text, as a subtitle of sorts, in white Times New Roman font. ""Don't smile at them. That indicates insanity."" It referred to my hallucinations and that I shouldn't smile at them or be glad to see them, as that would indicate insanity. It's something that's currently burned into my head. Can't get it out. This hallucination led to me having a dream in which I called the police where I was taken to a mental ward (I'm scared of mental wards/hospitals). I was a patient in a hospital, begging the nurse to give me a sleep mask because, I told her, ""I see things at night, shit you don't even wanna know about.""
4. **Other brief hallucinations**. All of these are just brief jumpscares that have high intensity, but half a second duration and are almost daily.  
Sometimes, if I'm brushing my teeth and I look up from the sink and up to the mirror, I'll briefly see a distorted or bloodied, mangled face that isn't mine. No face in particular, it's just screwed up beyond recognition.  
I'll see brief shadows in the corners of the hallway at night or on the ceiling. No shape in particular, though some appear to be humanlike.  
As I've mentioned before, insect legs moving. I've heard of one potential symptom of a psychosis, ""believing you have super powers"", which, in all seriousness, I have tried bringing back a dead insect or two before...more than twice. Afterwards, I'll hallucinate the dead insect's legs moving or twitching as if I brought them back to life. This was about a few years ago, and sometimes I'll try to do it nowadays to no avail. The bringing back the dead psychosis lasts for a few seconds, while the hallucination lasts for up to a minute.

I'm sorry for describing these hallucinations in a massive wall of text, I just had to describe them in as much detail as I could.

Onto the questions. I briefly mentioned this to my mom, how I have hallucinations, auditory and visual, and how I wanted to go to a therapist. She brushed it off and said that it was all in my head and that I shouldn't be having them. That was the only response. Now no disrespect to my mom, I love my mom very much, but I feel like that response wasn't exactly, how you say... appropriate. Shortly before asking her about the therapist thing, I had a small hearing of the voices in my head, again, going, ""Do it! Tell them!"" I finally complied and the response I got was a little...unnerving, to say the least.

Question 1. What should I tell her without sounding weird? I don't want to be spouting, ""I see things!"" or ""I see shadows at night!"" or something along those lines like a madman.

Now. Question 2. How should I word these experiences to a therapist, if I ever get one? I've been documenting my experiences in a journal, as well as mundane things that I think the therapist should know in terms of context, but I'm unsure of how to say it. I'm scared to say these things because I don't want to be in a mental ward, I'm terrified of a mental institution or hospital (heck I'm scared of hospitals overall).

Question 3. What should I do if the medication does not work or prolongs these effects? I'm scared to take medication for these things (fear of side effects, such as the hallucinations becoming worse or more vivid); I just want to rip them out of my head and stomp them into the ground. What should I do?

10,"Maybe it's even likely. Maybe it's why we should just *do* instead of *think*? Sometimes, when I regard the world as a whole and reality as an infinite dynamic force, then we as individuals are nothing more than stains on this planet. So in the bigger picture it's useless and that makes me sad and it hurts sometimes. 

I look up at the sky and see the clouds floating off and disappearing. That's what people do though. We simply *are* until we *aren't*. And it hurts even more when we see the people we love disappear. So why be born and gain things that are going to be ripped away from you eventually? 

Emptiness hurts, but it also hurts even more to lose something. Why isn't there something in the middle? Sometimes I just want to break and fall apart, so I don't have to feel empty or hurt. 

And when I think about it, it becomes so painfully clear that I AM ALIVE. However, being alive means dealing with all those negative emotions. But who in the world decided that I was strong enough huh?! Who said that I could manage it?! 
Yes, I'm mad. Yes, I wanna cry. It's too late to un-feel this shit. Who said that I could handle it?! Why the fucking hell. AM. I. HERE? This is a mistake.",23May2019,1
11,"J used to have a fantastic metabolism, I could eat anything and stay skinny, then I got on Zyprexa and instantly started gaining weight.

I'd picked up my marijuana habit again and that, for some reason, regulated my weight and I stayed the same weight, but then after I stopped I started gaining a lot of weight.

Now I'm pretty heavy, and very unhappy about it, but I pretty much need to be on zyprexa to stay stable. I've tried being on a lower dose or being off of it, and I was not alright. Being on it makes me stable.

I'm not looking for weight loss tips, just people in the same boat.

So, anyone else have this problem?",23May2019,3
12,"I've been battling every addiction under the sun since I was 18. I've ruined the majority of every close relationship I've had from paranoia or lack of self esteem. If I'm not abusing most recreational drug, I'm gambling to feed my obsessive behavior. I barely sleep, not by choice but by the racing of my mind and anxiety of facing the next day. I've been prescribed amitriptyline but now my mood during the day is rock bottom. I feel like crying constantly with suicidal thoughts racing through my mind. I can't find an ounce of happiness in anything I do. I have a constant worry running through my heart and nothing but a sick feeling that I haven't gotten rid of in months. On the exterior I'm a happy person. I don't have the guts to tell anyone I know how I feel, it makes me feel weak. Not sure what to do. Need some guideance from someone that's been here, and done this.",23May2019,4
13,"I've been struggling with procrastination for almost 10 years now and it's destroying my life. I've been studying for 14 semesters now (should be 7) because I never do anything for my exams. Even when I know that there will be consequences if I fail. I'm now down to just one remaining class and the thesis next semester, but I still can't bring myself to do the practical part of the class. One.class. I have six days per week to do it but I still can't make it and will most likely fail the practical part again. It's 3 AM here now, class begins at 9:30 and I thought I could still get some work done. Wrong.

After doing some research about the cause of it I found that it's linked to mood and depression. I'm indeed not happy most of the time. (Of course, I could I. Just sitting here browsing the web and watching tv shows instead of getting work done.) But I never actually considered it depression. But I have noticed, that when I'm in a better mood, I'm more likely to be productive. Recently, I have stumbled upon the concept of OCD which is also linked to depression. I do a lot of the typical behavior like washing hands to often or tripple checking if doors are locked. I repeat thoughts often and I'm also obsessed with being angry at something. For example someone insulted me years ago and I didnt't react the way I should have or wanted to have. Memories about such an event creeps back into my head and makes me angry to the point where I want to punch something and need to walk a few minutes in order to calm down. When I can't do that (for example in a lecture) I seemingly show signs like shaking (at least, I got asked if I'm alright during such an episode). There was one time in our students pub where I was sitting there, having a beer, talking to no one and got so angry about something in the past that had to leave immidiately because I would have screamed at the next person trying to talk to me. I know, that getting angry something in the past is futile and entirely useless, but I can't help not to do it.

I'm thinking about seeing the psychotherapist at our university, but I'm hesitating to go because it hasn't been really helpful in the past.

So my friend has recently been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and I don't know how to help her. I am diagnosed with depression, and I'm trying my best to help her with what she's going through, but whatever I, her friends, therapist or parents do, it only seems to go two steps backwards. She hasn't been talking to her friends lately, and is only making posts on instagram about how depressed she is, and how no one talks to her and that nothing is working for her. The posts on instagram usually follow a pattern, ""complaining about how her family is literally the worst people ever, what would happen if she killed herself and then saying how no one helps her, and that she's wanting to self harm.""

18,"I'm not the best at verbalizing my feelings, but I'll give it a shot. I know that theoretically it's helpful to focus on the stuff you can control, and let go of the stuff you can't.

I'm currently waiting on a grade back from my professor and I've tried doing work and stuff but I always end up half-assing it because part of my attention is stuck worrying about my grade.

19,"I need to do it. I know that. I’ve been holding off from it, trying to work out my problems by myself, for a long while now. Some of my problems, however, I can’t fix on my own. Which sucks. So much. 
I know my Dad will be understanding. He is not a stranger to these types of things, and we’ve even (kindof) talked about this kind of stuff. 
My Mom, however... I have no idea. I think it’s possible she’ll feel hurt and she’ll think it’s her fault and that I hate her. I don’t. 
If I were to be diagnosed with some form of personality disorder (realistically speaking, I wouldn’t be surprised if this were the case) I think my Mom would use that as an excuse/explanation as to how I act. 
They will both look at me differently for this, and I don’t know if I can handle that. Of course, I should be happy about that. I’m not the same person I was in 2015. I’m hardly even the same person I was 6 months ago.
A little while ago, I told myself I didn’t want things to stay the same. I wanted things to change. I either wanted things to get better, or worse. And they have gotten worse. 
I don’t know if I can handle the change that this will bring on. I want things to get better, but they’re going to have to get a lot harder first.
I haven’t even started on the therapy itself. 
I don’t know how to talk about how I feel. I don’t even know how I feel. And even if I were able to describe my feelings, it wouldn’t feel real when I started talking about them. The last time I went to a therapist, it was the same way, and I know it won’t be much different. 
I was never comfortable with making eye contact with people. I’m still not. I don’t want to go back to a therapist to have the same experience I did then. I want to talk as mutuals and I don’t want to be told what to do and if I don’t want to do something you have. To. Understand. That. 
Privacy is very important to me and it has been violated many times in the past. If I tell one person something personal (although I don’t do that anymore), I don’t want them to just go and repeat it to someone else. Don’t go through my phone again. And don’t just walk into my room and look through my stuff whenever you feel like it. 
I can’t stand being serious. I try not to take anything seriously. I avoid answering serious questions from my friends, and in turn they’ve stopped asking. But I’ve gotta do this if I ever want to be happy again. I don’t really care if I don’t end up being happy though, I just don’t want keep feeling like whatever this is.
Both parents are in the dark about this stuff, but they have their suspicions. 
I need to tell them that I need to see a therapist, but how do I approach this? What do I tell them? I don’t want to end up putting this off ‘until next week’... then ‘until next month’... because then school will start back up again and I won’t do it at all. 
To an extent I’m fucking terrified. This is going to be the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do (which says a lot about how ‘exciting’ my life is :/ ).

21,"Often times it's the things you find difficult that you give up on, and I've definitely been there/done that. But there have been so many times in my life where I've tried to accomplish something big, proven that I'm capable of doing it and be good at it, only to give it up shortly after. I really don't understand why my mind works like this.

The things I try to accomplish that I'm good at are great things for me, something that could lead to a great future, possibly doing something I'm passionate about for a living. But at the first sign of success it's like something in my brain goes ""that's good enough for me"" only to quit altogether. Like deep down all I wanted was to prove that I could do it and that's it.

The big thing that still eats at me is art. I put myself out there a year or two ago, and while the wind up was slow for a couple of months, my work eventually began to pick up traction, being shared around all over the web. It was great, I felt very proud of myself, but then I just stopped. It was like I said, like something in my brain just said ""that's good enough for me"" then I stopped altogether, until eventually my guilt for not having posted any new pieces nagged away at me until I just deleted my site/work to prevent it from being shared further.

I'm really interested to figure out if there's any rhyme or reason behind why I give up. Perhaps a deep fear of failure yet to be realized? I'm really unsure. Thanks for taking the time to read.",23May2019,2

I can’t keep a job because of it so I’m living with my parents with no income at 24 years old, I dropped out of college, and before I did that I lost my cross country and track scholarship when my grades dropped because of this issue (I had a 3.5 GPA my first year, but it spiraled down fast as I only passed one class of nine in the next two semesters). I’m always paranoid and usually dealing with anxiety, but on days were I’m really really bad I really seek out harming myself/others, but I’ve never had a suicidal thought or any thoughts of murder.

I had a fwb for a minute and wanted to date him but he was turned off by the amount of guys I've slept with. I now have another fwb who has no idea of my history but hes a complete asshole and now I'm attached and in love with him.

I was immediately connected to the psychiatrist’s office but told that there were no appointments for new patients for a while. After talking with the the nurse for a while she suggested I should go to their 24/7 crisis center to be seen immediately so they can adjust my meds so they can work. She made a note of our conversation in my chart so the intake people will know what to do. I’m a bit nervous to actually go. I looked up the reviews of the place and they are terrifying.

35,"Hi, I (F/19) suffer with depression and anxiety and currently have been on Celexa 20mg since February. Haven’t really had any side effects besides some nausea and headaches. Can’t say any improvements or negatives as I’m too early on for conclusions for this medication.

Anyways, for the past week, I’ve been feeling this weird feeling throughout my body. It’s like I’m there and aware of my surroundings, but I’m too aware and think something is wrong and I need to make mental checks to make sure I’m okay. I don’t believe I have depersonalization because it’s not that I think I’m not real, I just feel there but not at the same time. It’s very hard to explain but each time it happens I feel my anxiety heighten which makes this feeling worse. It sort of makes me feel like I’m going to go crazy because I can’t explain this “everything is wrong/something’s not right” feeling. Sort of fight or flight in a dream like state?

I guess I just need possible explanations on what it could be. Is it depersonalization? Derealization? Maybe just usual panic attacks or anxiety attacks? I’m going to speak to my doctor about it but it would be great if someone could help me out finding out what’s up. Thank you so much.",23May2019,2

It baffles me (always has) and I don’t know why. Hard to explain. I look in the mirror and have a hard time believing it’s really me. 

I also was diagnosed with depression and anxiety many years ago. I have a very unstable mood/temper and sometimes it’s like I switch to a different person. But I don’t have any cuts in my memory like you would with DID. It’s difficult for me to work with people because I end up snapping and getting angry even when they aren’t doing anything wrong.

he got a minor surgery for an ongoing issue recently, which i'm really proud of him for doing, which i was hoping would maybe lead to more progress, but instead he stopped taking his medication and this just feels like a huge setback on his progress. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tonight he's been complaining about EVERYTHING. he doesn't like his job so he's miserable, he doesn't have the education he thinks he needs to do something else so there's nothing he can do to change anything, he has no marketable skills and he's too old to change anything, he wants to do more with his life but he doesn't want to put in the effort, i could go on. It's like there are no positive aspects of his life, which i get why he feels that way, but he's not willing to even consider solutions or other options.

&amp;#x200B;

meanwhile through this all, i have been working full time, i take care of our house, i take care of our pets, i'm trying to pursue  something i'm passionate about in my spare time and do something for myself. and he hasn't been to work in months and plays video games and smokes and drinks all day and all night. i can't keep doing everything for our shared life together and not receive any help, or even acknowledgement. that's not why i do any of it, but it would still be nice.

how do i support him, but not get frustrated so often? if he has a bad day, i have a bad day, because it's taken out on me somehow, and i'm running out of energy and patience for all of this. i just wish i saw an effort, even a small one. i just want my partner back, because i no longer feel supported in any way, and i feel selfish for even wanting that when he's suffering so much. and the last thing i want is to make him feel like he's letting me down or not supporting me in the way i need, because i don't want to make him spiral deeper into depression than he already is.  am i expecting too much of him? am i being whiny and selfish? i honestly can't tell anymore.",23May2019,1

43,"It sucks, and thing of it is, you're not fully aware of how irrational, or outlandish it can be till you think back on it later. 

I inherited it mostly from my mom, to my knowledge. She is schizophrenic but more of the paranoid delusional areas of the spectrum. 

It did really manifest in me till in my late teen/early twenties. At that point it was mostly just hypochondriac behavior with some slight suspicion of family members or friends tampering with my food or drink. It grew though, and became a conspiracy of ""someone is trying to poison me, it's one of you"" in my kind. A battlefield of sorts, trying to find the culprit, while simultaneously  trying to pick up a cup and convince myself my grandmother who raised me would never put Ajax into my drink, as I attempt to bring myself to sip.

Amongst other delusions, was the infamous government. My goodness, it was a firm belief that they were always trying to find out information about me. Bugging my phone, tapping into my accounts. Watching me. Everywhere. I never felt safe, 100%. 

Flash forward, I began to develop hunches, that my closest friends were having sex with my (now wife) girlfriend at the time. And secretly, they don't even like me. They just keep me around for good measure. Perhaps I amuse them. Some plaything for their enjoyment. Or maybe they're too soft to tell me theyre annoyed, and would rather I left them alone. 

To add to this, I sometimes feel my wife is cheating on me...

Just earlier, merely minutes ago I just had an episode. 

I'll sum this up: my wife poisoned my coffee, my coworkers just had sex with her outside on their smoke break while I was inside working, and they don't want me outside the office. 

To anyone who thinks have a mental illness is a game, it's not. It's not fun. We do not enjoy this. It is called a MENTAL ILLNESS for a reason. We're sick, we are not healthy.

45,"TW: suicidal thoughts 



I started having weird suicidal thoughts a few years ago—I’ve heard that it can crop up due to strep infections and I finally got my tonsils removed two years ago after a decade of chronic strep leading to an abscess. My mom also has anxiety (which lead to anorexia when she was my age) and my dad has PTSD. 

Mostly, when I am extremely stressed, I have repetitive thoughts about how I should die or that I’d like to be hit by a bus. I don’t make plans to do anything. In a way, it feels very shallow—that it’s not what I really want, but I feel trapped and it’s part of a flight response. It’s not emotional, nor do I feel like it’s even really a part of my own thought process. The persistence of the repetitive thought is the main thing that makes it scary. 

On occasion, I worry that I may act inappropriately I social situations, but this tends not to happen too often and is usually tied to be feeling anxious talking to someone. I often also worry about my partner dying in a car accident to a completely irrational degree. He’s a safer driver than I am.

I was diagnosed, late, as an adult with ADHD about 3 years ago. I’m not sure if that plays a role at all. I noticed that the repetitive thoughts go away if I take time to relax, sleep, exercise, and establish a normal routine.  

Currently, I’m very burnt out from getting my degree. I’m easily stressed by otherwise simple tasks in a way I wouldn’t be normally. I think I have been burnt out for the past 2 years. After two successive deaths my uncle and grandma last month and helping my mom with executorship, I’ve noticed my anxiety fluctuating in more erratic ways during the past few weeks. I’m more prone to panic attacks and crying.

Luckily, I’m about to transition to a more normal work schedule with a regular income and hopefully a middle class salary. I’ll be living with my wonderful partner after a year of living apart and I’ll be able to develop a more regular routine.

Does this sound like I might be readjusting my life in a healthier way for the right circumstances?",23May2019,5

50,"(This is long, bear with me) ......The day started off okay, until at work one of my co-workers (let's say Fran) had an issue with me, and no one knows why. I didn't even really talk to her nor do I really know her. I just meet Fran that same day. Everyone knows I am a nice person at work, so they are pretty clueless too. I think it started off when I was on break and people watching. Our eyes meet a couple times and she asked, ""do you have a problem with my face?"" I was confused and politely told her no I was just people watching. Then after that, I noticed she looked mad or something cuz she wasn't hyper anymore or smiling. (she did have coffee earlier on). I asked her if her sugar high was crashing and me gave this dead pan look. I am then confused and after we finish helping a customer, I ask what's wrong. Still dead pan look before saying, nothing. I am like, are you sure? (I am a people pleaser and I hate fighting.) Anyway. Fran doesn't talk to me at all now and I am like, is she mad at me? Like wtf did I do? So, I smile and kind of joke around, and it ended with me saying, oh yeah you are pissed. It ends with her leaving work and having the manager drive her home. No one knows why she was pissed at me. She wouldn't tell anyone. So, I am reassuring myself that I can't be-friend everyone, and move on after a while. Then at my other job, I thought things were going well until they weren't....I work in a medical office where i clean and recently had to change areas, because my manager is going to have surgery. So I am now on level 3 instead of 2. Anyway, I have done it before and was doing it my usual way, thinking I am doing a wonderful job until I find out I wasnt. They area I was working in had its monthly little test where they put coffee dots on the floors all over to see if we are cleaning. In the procedure room, I guess I was supposed to be moving everything and I mean everything from equipment to trash cans. And I wasnt, I didn't know. But I should have right? My coworker (Yolanda) texted them and they went upstairs to recheck and they found more stains and even 3 plastic needle covers near the doorways. And I am shitting bricks in my mind. Cuz I dont go slow but I dont go fast either when I clean and I didn't see any of the plastic covers when I mopped and broomed. I did see the coffee stains and got some of them but not all. When my manager said, we need to talk...my mind went to panic mode. She started to explain what I had missed and I freaked out in my head. Cuz I know that for the exam rooms I moved everything around all the time but apparently still missed things. I even swore on my brother grave to her and realized I was sounding crazy and overreacting a smidge, but I couldn't help it. Was I scared? Did there need to be excuses/reasons?  How could I miss those? Why didn't I think of moving the door, etc. And now I am thinking i am stupid and that i shouldn't have acted like that and belittling myself while going through the whole scenario AND shouting in my head to shut up to stop thinking. I want to cry and wish that didn't happen. (Sorry for the long post.) I feel like I am about to panic. What kind of attack is this? I feel crazy.",23May2019,1

59,"I think it's time that we open up and talk about some things that need to be talked about. The truth of life is. The older you get. The darker thing seem. We lose people, to sickness, to addiction, to mental illness, or to violence or hate crimes. Friendships slip away and bonds are broken. People we thought wed have forever end up lost. Important people are lost too soon. Honestly at the rate things are going. I can't tell if as I grow older I'm becoming more self aware of all those who end up lost, or if more people are passing. So much is going on in the world right now and a million thoughts are buzzing around in the air. Everyone cares about something different, and at any given moment another person could get lost in this carnival of souls. And that's hard. I have had people who meant the entire world to me dissapear over night. And it's heart breaking. I know people who might lose the only family they have left, I know people who are battling so much sickness, I know people who are in constant pain, I know people who have almost lost their best friends. Each of those that I wrote down was wrote with a specific person in mind. It's no longer a generalization, its personal. The truth is not everything in the world is happy. Not every breathing moment will be great. But that's why we need to fight. Fight for every bit of happiness we can get. Fight the good fight and be strong, and stand up for what matters to us. Everyone is fighting their own fight. Even if you cant see it on the outside. And we only have so many days to live this life, so please, make an effort to do good things for those around you. Make someone smile. Compliment them. Hug someone. Even if you hate hugs. Gift them something. Smile at someone who doesn't get smiled at. Be kind to each other. Because if you've ever struggled before, you know what it's like to need support. Even from a stranger. I know that this generation thinks everything is a joke. We're all guilty of self deprivation, we're all guilty of saying something behind someones back because we think its witty or clever. But you don't know what it is like to live life through their eyes. This generation thinks shootings, and sickness, and suicide are all jokes, we treat everything like a joke, but it's time that we make a change. Stop living in our old ways and let people know we care. We can either keep on battling in secret, or group together and care about one another. So please. If you think nothing I've ever said in the past has ever been important, let this be the one thing you consider. Everyone of you has lost someone important to you. Everyone of you has battled emotional demons, every one of you has had to cope with feeling like you're not good enough, or not strong enough, and I think that it's time that we boost people up instead of affirming their insecurities. I poured my heart out into this message, so please dont stomp on it and call it stupid. But please make an effort to pass on some sort of positivity in someones life. And live every moment like it could be your last. I love every single one of you. Pass on the positivity, good luck, and good vibes. -Jay",23May2019,53

its all been kind of a blur but i think i came onto reddit to try to find out what the fuck was going on, more and more memories popped up reading through others posts and i began to feel as if they were actually speaking to me like it was my past they were telling, trying to help me to remember, i ended up getting completley overwhelmed and had a bit of breakdown leading to a short stay in a paychiatric unit. 


I'm on leave at the moment and back on reddit and i feel like they're still here, trying to help me get my shit together, i dont really know whats going on but its kind of working? i've been stuck inside my head for the past 5 or so years completley shut myself off from the rest of the world, but im not scared anymore i dont even know what i was scared of if im being completley honest. its like i've woken up, i dont really know how to explain it.


on the memory side of things are still confusing and i dont really know what actually happened and have lots of mixed feelings/emotions about it all, its a complex fucking 38473902 piece puzzle with no picture guide. 


i know that i'm a fucking mess, but i actually feel like i can climb out of this hole i've been stuck in for so many years, i actually feel hopeful. i dont know how long this feeling will last, but for right now i'm ok with that.

But recently I’ve become more aware of the fact that I can’t seem to focus on what I’m doing and rather I find myself drifting in my mind wondering what I can do to get away from everything.

I most commonly think about my future and how I will get there. I make a huge deal in my head because I know I procrastinate. Throughout the day I tell myself over and over the same thoughts. And it seems I demote myself because of it. 

This post is kind of “all over the place.” Does anyone have an idea of what I might be able to do to feel alive again?",23May2019,1

I also seem tired all the time but I'm just lazy lmao.  


I don't have any other symptoms, apart from the normal ""suicidal"" thoughts - but I'm in 0% danger as I could never do that to my family and GF.

I have been off all psych meds now for a year, and in this year I have felt more alive, have more clarity, sexually better, far more creative, and a I guess some more but thats the bulk of the good. The bad: I have had increasing paranoia, and I suppose delusions of paranoia (people plotting, govt watching, other stuff), when I get depressed it is *deep* suicidal thoughts and just dark places. I don't feel like killing myself, but when I'm depressed I think about how my head would look after I blew it off with a shotgun, or if I would use a pistol and risk blowing my face off and surviving. 

Anyways, I also seem to hallucinate constantly. It is just all day and night, little things move, I hear things, a lot of little inconsequential things moving that shouldn't that remind me there's a screw loose. Sometimes it is bad, I think I hallucinate that people say things or think things and even worse I think I am hallucinating they have looks on their faces and I get angry about it. This causes small issues in public. But what I don't like is that I am not in control of anythiing. These visual and auditory hallucinations happen so much at a constant rate that I am unsure what I am experiencing is real or not. I ask my wife if she thinks I am acting strange or crazy and she says no.

I believe that, I am very good at hiding things. I just want to know why I might be hallucinating all the time and what is causing it. If it was schizophrenia wouldn't I have had a pronounced psychotic episode? I feel pretty rooted in reality, with the exceptions of what I have mentioned here.

75,"Hi.

I’m pretty sure I’ve been depressed on and off since I was 11 or so.  Now 45, I think really it’s more of a BPD thing, as I meet 5 of the criteria.   

Because my abusive and alcoholic father was a psychologist who ridiculed his patients and the mentally ill after work, I never felt comfortable seeking help.  On my own I’ve kept it to a minimum and managed to stay employed, buy a house, and start my own family.  

But guess what?  After 30 + years of depression, disassociated thinking, self harm, substance abuse, hyper sexuality and disordered eating, I’m ready to fix myself before I pass this bullshit on to my kids.  But all the therapists in my town aren’t taking new patients.  Or, they only take cash, and it’s not in my budget.  

So what do you do in these cases?  Where do you turn?",23May2019,1
76,"Getting a license where I'm from is really hard. It costs a shit ton of money, and passing on the first test is a rare thing nowadays. I just had my fourth one today. Every test is super expensive, and I have test anxiety.


The tester started aggressively commenting on something I did (which was totally correct, idk why he did that). That made me even more anxious and worried (and that NEVER happened to me or to someone I know, testers talking while testing here is discouraged and seen as a bad thing). After that, he asked me to park in a place that's really hard to park in (and my chances were low anyway), so as I tried parking there he stopped the car (which fails you on the spot). Instead of continuing the test (which was doomed anyway) for 25 more minutes, I had a breakdown, turned off the car (I think), stormed out of it angrily, slammed the door, and went outside crying. I couldn't bear with failing once again, wasting more money on that, and skipping uni for a day just to fail once again. It's been over an hour since, and my heart is still pounding like crazy. My driving teacher called me and said that this might prevent me from applying for tests for AN ENTIRE YEAR and also going to this rehab center (I don't know why or what's gonna be there if that's gonna happen).


My grandpa is in the hospital in a very bad condition, my dad had 5 slipped discs in his back, and I'm overall in a very tense atmosphere which also helped me a lot with the test. I'm the most tense person I know (regardless of that) and I'm always alert as if I were a wild animal running away from hunters. I even tried meditating but it didn't work since I couldn't stop being so tense and anxious. I've been thinking of using marijuana lately to ""soften"" me up but I fear I'll develop an addiction to it.

I haven't done ANYTHING like this for the last five years, and at least I didn't hit myself like I used to. I guess I matured with that at least. 


I feel like a worthless piece of shit that won't even succeed with that ever. All my friends passed at their third test (tops), and they all have their licenses already. I feel ashamed of my self, humiliated, and even more worthless than I used to feel. All that comes with me barely able to sleep normally lately and a shit ton of pressure on myself.


Please don't advise going to therapy because it totally screwed me up when I did go to it and it made me feel even worse. It's not an option. So are meds.",23May2019,1

When my grandmother (who's a physchiatrist) said it my problems sound like BPD, I felt truly happy for once, because there was a reason for me being the way I am. I won't get into detail about how I act (unless you ask), but when I went to my Counsellor at CAMHS, he said that 1. I was too young to be diagnosed and 2. It's just a label. But this pisses me off, because at least if it is a label, I have people like me to support me. Does he know how fucking lonely I feel at times?

83,"I am a 24yo girl from Europe. That’s what I did today until now: I woke up very depressed and anxious so I binge ate sweets, then I went to the bathroom, shoved two fingers in my mouth, and I vomited. I listened to some music. I cut my arms, swallowed a pill to sleep and now I am just watching tv and writing this post because I feel the need to vent. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety 3 years ago (I am on medication but tbh I don’t take them everyday) but exactly 4 days ago I started to overeat, voluntary vomit and cut myself (not deeply). I see a psychologist once a week but I didn’t tell her what it is happening because I am afraid to be hospitalized. I am lonely and I don’t have anybody to talk to. I mean, I have my mom,she loves me, I live with her, but she is extremely busy lately so we can’t spend time together. I feel so lonely. I don’t have friends atm and I have never had a bf. Why am I so fucked up? Basically from elementary school to high school I was heavily bullied and marginalized because of my looks (I have a facial deformity which makes me look ugly).Plus I never felt loved. As I said, I have never had true friends or a boyfriend. Guys aren’t interested in me due to my looks. I can’t change my looks so I am pretty sure I will always be lonely (and virgin xD) and that makes me suffer a lot because I know how terrible loneliness is and I don’t want to spend all my life alone.

84,"When I was a kid I would watch movies and shows where someone had mind-reading powers and it always demonstrated this as if the person could hear complete sentences and conscious streams of thought from the people around them. I always thought that was an overly simplistic way of showing that since I never think in complete sentences. 

Years later I asked a few people about it and they all confirmed that they think in sentences, whole thoughts, in the form of words. 

I can write easily, but can’t plan out what I’m going to say in advance. I just start and stop when I feel I’ve said what I need to say. My posts here tend to be long as a result. 

Imagine a room where a thousand films have been edited, and the editors dropped the cut-away bits of film onto the floor for years and years. Now go into that room and edit together all the bits of film on the floor, randomly. That’s what the inside of my head is like. 

Other than some PTSD and off and on depression, I am not aware of, nor do I exhibit, any other major symptoms of anything. I don’t tend to have difficulty focusing at work unless the task I’m doing is super boring or annoying (just like anyone). If I’m reading a book I’m really enjoying, I can focus on it for long stretches. I can play video games for hours and work on large and complex projects without any struggle. 

But my thought process is a constant mess and it has been for as long as I can remember. I jump from image to image. Sometimes the jumps make sense, there’s a connection I can track, but most of the time it seems random. 

Case in point, I thought about posting this here and imagined myself doing it. I tried to force myself to think this plan in words. My head went “mental health mental health mental health mental health” and I saw flashes of a coworker, the plants I just planted in my backyard, a cat (that wasn’t one of my cats), and my email inbox at work. Then I just started writing. 

Google is sort of failing me. I have never felt like these thoughts are intrusive. They’re just background noise.

I think about how I could drive off the road into the ditch. I think about how I could swerve into oncoming traffic. I wish someone else was stupid on the road and hit me. 

I get to work and think about how I could jump off the top of the parking garage. I walk to lunch and think about how I could walk in front of a bus or the train. I think about how a homeless person or anyone on the street could mug me and stab me. 

I think about how easy it would be to go home and take a whole bottle of pain meds. I’m disappointed every morning when I wake up. I wish I would get some terminal illness. I wish something, anything would happen to me.

And guess what, I have these thoughts even on good days. They’re constant. They never stop. And while I’ve been actively suicidal before, it’s now just become a passive thoughts. And while this might seem like a big deal, something to worry about, it’s something I have learned to live with. 

Sometimes people don’t talk about these dark thoughts that can come with mental illness. They are ashamed, scared of what people might think. But we need to share! I thought I was the only one who had thoughts like this until I saw a post about it, and when I did it was such a relief to know I was not alone! And even if you’re not struggling with these thoughts, it’s good to know some people do, because being there for these people means the world to them, trust me!

I’ve been inpatient twice in my life and neither times helped, but it was only because I acted out and refused help. Last time I went was late 2017. 
Over the past few years my mental and physical health has just progressively been getting worse. 
I didn’t go to high school because of multiple reasons, and because of that I’ve been isolated with occasional social outings and unable to get a job. I recently have grown distant with my only irl friends because of their busy schedules so I’ve been essentially completely isolated for weeks on end. Being alone this much has really made everything else I’m dealing with worse. Depression, suicidal ideation, severe social anxiety, bpd, paranoia, etc.
Before anyone asks, I’m 19 but I don’t have a license, car, or a job, and I’m agoraphobic which gets significantly worse when I’m out alone vs with someone else, so I rely on others to help get me out of the house (as much as I wish I didn’t.)

I’m becoming unable to take care of myself because of both my physical and mental issues. I’m terrified of adult inpatient wards and neither me nor my dad have the money to afford it, but I really don’t know what else to do to get help. I’ve had multiple therapists and psychiatrists since I was 11 but none of them have really helped because unless I am forced to get help, I don’t seek it out.

So, most of my adult life I've had these episodes where I dissociate and just wander back and forth, or just walking off aimlessly. I will mutter things and rambling the same word/phrase over again and occasionally it's just post-verbal noises. I will move my body and tend to tap my head. I barely remember the beginning and end of episodes, and I feel like I'm just watching myself do this. I can't remember what activated me. I only have had these so many times in my adult life and I don't remember enough from my childhood to know if I had them then  
I just had my first episode in a couple of years and there is a possible connection to the drug Wellbutrin, which I just came off of 2 months ago. This alerted my therapist and he wants me to see my psychiatrist and see if I possibly need to do some testing.

Due to its complexity, it would be great if you could take time to carefully read main article by following the link cause the data that I'm presenting is so important when making a conclusion here. I had so many bizarre experiences. Imagine this experience by putting yourself into this scenario as it might help you understand this a bit more clearly. By doing so, here you would understand that depend on the way these synchronicities get manifested to an observer, an observer would make different erroneous conclusions depend on their knowledge, depending on their beliefs, depend on their critical thinking ability, etc.. therefore, the delusions that would arise in an observer's mind would be different in each scenario. Let me state a life lesson prior writing the summary of my experience here. In my story I mentioned this:  


&gt;""Nevertheless, by facing such an extreme situation, I understood the importance of having the right view and I understood that ignoring important data (due to trust issues, seeing as not important, etc..), not being able to understand the available data, not having enough data, will create delusions in our minds.""

In short:

&amp;#x200B;

A few years ago, due to the events that I observed around me, this is including activities on Facebook, the conversations that people had whilst I was with them, the conversations that I had with them on calls, I started noticing that they were indirectly referring to me. Though at first I thought certain things are mere coincidences only, I observed that it goes beyond to a level that I could consider as a coincidence, thus made me believe that my friends are talking about me. This kept on happening for a long time. And then later I observed people started referring to the conversations that I'm having at home thus proving me that my house has been hacked now(I observed extremely high number of synchronicities) yet I could not find any identifiable source for this leak of private conversations. These incidences created delusions in me such as my friends have fixed microphones in my house, my neighbors' are listening to my conversations, they see me through camera's etc..  


I had lots of arguments with my friends but all the time, it became a surprise to them yet the very next day it kept on happening giving me evidence of lying by my friends about their involvement. This abnormal phenomena or the synchronicities simply fooled me again and again to think that my friends are indeed participating and they are listening to my private conversations.  


Later, I observed that people started referring to my thoughts too. Again I had to conclude this due to high number of synchronicities only. Certain times, I tested if my friends could refer to my thoughts by thinking specific things and again, they responded just like they knew my thoughts. Therefore, at this time I had no doubts about my conclusions. Which made me to conclude that my friends are taking NSA's (this is another false conclusion) help in decoding my thoughts. I thought NSA could have this technology since so many people online was claiming the same. At this point, people in TV and Radio also started referring to my thoughts, I also got emails from companies like Microsoft, Guardian, etc.. where these email heading always showed a meaning to my life events, which made me believe that so many people around the world knows me. And their participating in this strange harassment. These events made me to completely stop meeting my friends cause I couldn't trust them any longer. The phenomena (synchronicities) created the trust issues.  


However, later I thought I should directly handle this situation and I started having a serious conversation with one friend and he actually tried to help me. This made me to trust my friend and I knew this friend usually meet certain friends regularly and they would not lie to each other for something like this. Since, this phenomena convinced me that my friends are involved in this harassment, I created a chain of trust to understand this abnormal phenomena through him by asking him to clarify if others are aware of anything related to my life. To surprise me they also didn't know anything.  


I started having deep thoughts, how I ended up in having such conclusions? What really happened to me? Why do I see a totally different world view now when I analyze this phenomena from trusted channels or trusted parties? Did someone fool me for such a long time on a daily basis? What could be the purpose and if so how? These events were real, I wasn't dreaming. To address these controversies I decided to check Facebook walls too. So I started checking Facebook profiles/ their walls, just to make sure that these statuses made by my friends, the things they shared on their walls in the past are still there and I could still find it. If so did someone hacks their profiles or did they actually made these statuses? But even if this is hacking, how can I find a logical reason for all my other observations? What about dreams? What about TV/Radio presenters? What about scriptwriters or these dramas. Emails that I got? News articles? Power cuts, the conversations that I had over calls, etc. Hacking itself cannot explain all the controversies. Having said that I still thought of talking to my friends and wanted to know if they have actually made those statuses in the past and if so what made them do so since this should give clues to understand this mystery. And I called them, there I found out that they have actually made those statuses and shared certain posts. Certain occasions, I found out that they had random thoughts to make a status or share a post on their walls. And on certain occasions, they had specific reasons to do so. So it wasn't hacking at all, they actually had thoughts in their minds related to these actions.  


To make a status or to share a post, they should have thoughts in their minds and they should make a conscious decision. Even at this point, I cannot take any of these as mere coincidences only, cause, this is beyond what I could consider as a coincidence since this kept on happening for such a long time and I carefully observed it. I tested my assumptions too and observed the reactions prior to making a conclusion. This is why I had to question the meaning of reality too and I was looking for logical answers to this mystery since at times I clearly saw controversies. Therefore, by analyzing all, I had to conclude that their thoughts are being affected in some strange way although they never knew.This was the first time that I actually knew that these are extremely abnormal coincidences or synchronicities. By affecting their thoughts, their actions have been affected. And that correlated with my life events. However, this is completely invisible to everyone. This become apparent only by deeply analyzing my observations only. We can conclude this due to the extremely high number of synchronicities that I have faced with so many people around the world. I also realized that on certain occasions my thoughts also have been affected. For example, there were times I switched on the radio just to hear them talking about me (the synchronicities).  


This unidentified influence on human brains/minds is the cause behind the meaningful events or the synchronicities that I have been observing on a daily basis. My observations and the assumptions that I made to understand these meaningful events (synchronicities) made me end up in having false conclusions. This was the reason behind my delusions. Therefore, finally I started making sense of my reality and now I understand why my friends always rejected my accusations, why they got surprised all the time.  


It was almost like this phenomena had it's own mind that is capable of understanding my life and influencing the life of the people around me thus capable of fooling me, tricking me to end up in having false conclusions. Therefore, these are not delusional references as some people might think. By analysing everything, I had to conclude that not only my mind is being decoded, people's thoughts are being affected to create these synchronicities. At that time, even my family members got a little bit afraid thinking that I'm going through some mental problems, however, I was lucky to find out finally that synchronicities were behind my false conclusions. I found out that doctors had a general belief that these are delusional references which is another false conclusion only since I found out that these are synchronicities. Simply by finding the right way to challenge these beliefs we can take people out of these beliefs.  


This is not all, let me list down so many other strange life experiences that I had. I found people around the world have been going through similar experiences:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Sometimes I would think of a song and then it goes in the radio.
2. Myself and my family is having a conversation and we were teasing my cousin and then the radio plays the right track out of the blue. We all started laughing just because of the timing of the song.
3. I see my friends in my dreams and they either would call me next day or they would change their facebook status that would show correlation to my life activities.
4. I was thinking of a person and then he would call me. (This is not an experience that I had before in my life)
5. Songs got stuck in my head and I couldn’t forget no matter what I do
6. I observed that my friends would spontaneous start talking about something but at these times, I was thinking the same topic.
7. My mother would say words that was in my mind. (someone could think that the family members also participate but in my case I trusted my family members more than anyone on Earth so I disregarded these experiences and I couldn't make sense of it)

&amp;#x200B;

Thereafter I did a massive research and I found out that people who claim that they get messages from TV/Radio, their thoughts are being broadcast, people are gang stalking etc.. are due to these synchronicities only. I found out that the reason for thought broadcast is due to synchronicities only. Since the origin of thought broadcast delusion goes back to 17th to 18th century only, does that mean, something started interacting with our brains/minds during this period? Or what could be the reason? That said, addressing trust issues will vanish certain delusions that people have. What are the implications of this? When I compare my experience with others I can clearly see the correlations. When you ending up in having a false conclusion or delusion, did you also observe coincidences but later that created a false belief in you due to the way it kept on manifesting? Nevertheless, hope this help someone! ",23May2019,0

99,"So I have never done this before and I don’t know what to do and I don’t know where to start. But I am not ok. I feel like I have hit rock bottom I have never felt as low as I do now and I have finally accepted that I need professional help. 

I am getting out of a relationship that I guess in my heart I knew wasn’t meant to be but I lied to myself and kept trying. He didn’t want a relationship with me he was honest about how he felt for months and I was the stupid clingy girl that kept hoping he would change his mind. I just wanted a normal relationship I just wanted what everyone else has but he did not want the same thing. I don’t blame him he was upfront and honest from the beginning I was just stupid to think that we could be together. I should have just shut up and done things his way and let him decide and make the rules instead of talking about my feelings and pushing him to be with me. I’m emotional and sensitive and I got hurt by my own stupidity.

For the past 3 months I have been feeling extremely insecure about myself and like I don’t deserve to be happy. I really really hate myself at this moment and I don’t want to feel like this anymore. I cried nonstop for hours last night because I was feeling heartbroken once again but I finally realized that this is not normal. Feeling so horrible about yourself and crying until you feel like your heart is physically going to burst is not ok. I can’t do it on my own I am not strong enough to keep going on like this. I know I’m crazy for getting affected as much as I am. I am used to frequent waves of mild depression due to a chronic illness and a rush of hormones but what I am going through now is definitely harder that it’s ever been before. 

So now I know what I have to do but I don’t know where to start. I don’t know what kind of mental health professional to seek out. I know I definitely do not want to be medicated or anything of the sort, it’s mostly that I need someone to talk to that will actually listen. Is that a therapist? Or a psychologist? I live in the US in the Chicagoland area and I am unsure if this is something that is usually covered by health insurance. How can I find out if it will be covered by my insurance or not? If it is not covered, what is the price range I am looking at? Is there a better resource than google I can use?

If I could say one thing to someone who doesn't understand my struggle with mental illness it would be to openly and honestly tell them my story, start to finish. I was born to an abusive dad, but a very loving (although sometimes anxiety riddled) mother and luckily she got me out of that situation and left my dad. Growing up with a single mom was very hard, and I did my best to behave, but as a fourth grader with ADD and ADHD, it was hard. As I grew up things got worse. My simple behavioral issues turned into something much more serious and I turned to drugs to cope. That was right after my depression started to manifest and right before my bipolar first showed up. I began to self harm, I had no interest in being alive unless I was high, and most days, I can honestly say I had 1 if not many ways of killing myself. At this point I was only 15, and when I was going to a private school, I ended up getting expelled and I ran away. It was the only thing I could think to do in that manic state, and that got me no where. I ended up staying with a guy who I thought was my friend, but he got me high and raped me, which made my trauma only that much worse. I was so confused at the time and I ended up turning to sex for validation during my manic episodes, but on top of all of this, I was still just a kid, and it was too much for me to handle. I tried to kill myself the day after I turned 16 years old and luckily, I survived. I am now medicated, fully functioning, with a girlfriend, a family who loves me, and a life that I'm ready to live and embrace.

110,"(Possible Trigger Warning) 
I’ve dealt with mental health issues my entire life but was never diagnosed until January of 2018. I was checked into the psychiatric ward in my local hospital for suicidal thoughts, where I was diagnosed with Depression and Anxiety, with plans to be tested for more mental illnesses in the future (still ongoing). Then in March of 2018 I also made an attempt on my life, but my method was faulty and it failed. 

Today, I got unexpectedly called into my therapist’s office, after an hour long chat - we made a “Crisis Plan” (what I will do if I’m ever having issues coping) and she officially discharged me from therapy. She is leaving my file open (until I request it to be closed) so if I ever need just a single appointment I can schedule it easier. 

I skipped over a lot of bullshit that happened and extended my treatment, but considering this was only supposed to be a 2 month treatment plan that ended up being 16 months; I’m pretty damn happy to be discharged today.

If enough people ask I’ll explain what happened in more detail but I just really wanted to share this and to remind everyone; as cliche as it is, life can and will get better and there is no shame in reaching out for help if you need it ❤️.

113,"Hey guys,

I don't know if I'm in the right place but recently I've developed a fear of storms and more specifically tornados.  I live in Illinois and where I'm at they do happen frequently but typically are pretty minor and don't cause a lot of damage.  There's been zero reported deaths from my area that I'm aware of but I can't get the fear out of my head. 

 I don't really know how it started but it's all I can think about if there's even the idea of a storm starting within the week.  I obsessively look at weather apps.  I have started being afraid to go to work.  (I commute an hour). The house I moved into a couple of years ago doesn't have a basement which I'm thinking might be part of what has developed the fear.

I've always been a bit obsessive and anxious. I have miserable untreated ADD that just seems to be getting worse.  I've looked up what I can do to try and get over it but every time I feel like I'm getting better a storm gets announced and I feel myself shrinking into a ball.  

I feel like I can no longer live a normal life like this.  The stress is having a horrible effect on me as well as my amazing fiance who has anxiety issues as well.  My insurance doesn't cover anything mental health related and my budget can't afford to get the help I need.

128,"Dear Reddit, 

this is my first time posting in this sub, and I don't know if my problem is important enough, but anyhow.

Ever since the start of high school(In the Netherlands age 12-18) I've been unable to have any kind of normal conversation with any girl(I'm a guy, 18 years old) except for close family. I feel like whenever a social situation presents itself in which I have to spend time or do a project with a female, I can't bring myself to talk normally. This is kind of in a Rajesh from The big bang theory way.

Because of this, I haven't had a girlfriend since elementary school and I actively avoid any situations with the possibility of having to conversate with girls. I don't attend any school activities, parties, or even go to stores. I can, however, talk completely normally to guys or close family members. 

Every time somebody asks me why I still don't have a girlfriend, or why I never bring girls home, I get more and more sad. I do sometimes try to overcome this fear, and talk to girls from my class, or even acquaintances, but I always start to mumble and stutter halfway through a sentence, resulting in a swift, but unbearably awkward breaking of conversation.

A bit of backstory:
I have been bullied a lot in elementary schools, which left me with paranoia and trust issues, even though it was more than 7 years ago. 

This issue is one I'm very uncomfortable with, but I can't really talk to anyone about it in person, because they will just laugh at me(This has happened multiple times before).

129,"Confession: I am a recovering perfectionist.
—————
When I saw this quote from JamesWedmore, I raised my hands and said, “Hallelujah!” because, for me, my past perfectionism was fueled by an innate desire not to be criticized. And I didn’t want to be criticized because my self-esteem was rooted in others’ opinions of me. If people were happy with me and my work, I was on top of the world. If people were disappointed with me/my work (because at that time, unfortunately, I was my work and my work was me - there was no difference), I was in the depths of misery. Because people and circumstances are fickle, you can imagine the emotional roller coaster ride I was living. I’ve experienced firsthand how destructive - emotionally, mentally, physically, and spiritually - perfectionism is.
—————
As a recovering perfectionist, I’ve learned to:
* separate myself from my work (they’re not the same thing)
* truly value myself
* realize that others’ opinions and outside circumstances are just that - they exist outside of who I am and apart from my innate value.
I no longer need to shield myself from criticism because criticism doesn’t destroy my sense of self anymore. I embrace feedback, and it fuels me to progress.
—————
Strive for progress, not perfection. And, remember, YOU ARE VALUABLE JUST FOR BEING YOU.",23May2019,9
130,"I posted many times before on separate accounts that I’m extremely afraid of dogs and go into a full panic attack if I even see or hear one. No one even bothered to really respond and no one said anything besides basically “sucks for u sorry u gotta live through that”

My own fucking family just forgot about it and demeans me when I tell them, saying it’s nothing more than a childhood fear and that I should get over it by now.

No one takes my mental health seriously god dammit I’m sick of being useless to everyone because I’m too afraid to hang out or work outside in fear of a dog even though I rationally know nothing will happen. I just get full blown panic when I see a dog and I can’t use my brain.

131,"First time posting here, please don’t mind the rambly-ness of this. Today I was thinking about something that happened years ago that made me realize schools don’t do much about suicidal students. 

When I was in high school I was severely depressed and going through a really difficult time in my life due to my parents divorce, particularly after being sent to live with my neglectful and abusive dad. I was self harming, battling an eating disorder, and was barely sleeping at night. I was absolutely struggling pretty clearly on the outside. I had a teacher tease me for looking so miserable at school every day and I got in trouble for being inattentive or dozing off in classes among my high-achieving peers. It was a rough time. 

I remember changing a password to something I accessed at school to iwannadie. It must have been flagged because I was sent to my guidance counselor, who really only ever gave people advice and help with applying to college, and she basically got me in trouble and threatened to tell my parents, and made me sign a contract that I wouldn’t kill myself. It totally cured me of all depression and I was never suicidal again! /s

Anyway, it upsets me that they didn’t do anything more about this. They didn’t mention it to my parents or anyone else, they never followed up again, and didn’t have a therapist or a professional to refer me to, in school or out. 

Schools need to have a resource for students. I was so vulnerable and depressed and I was shamed for it rather than helped. Guidance counselors don’t really have time for this, which is understandable, but they MUST have someone else there to support students during tough times if that’s the case.",23May2019,426

He's always been the ""bottle up"" type due to his childhood and the relationship we have is LDR (Long Distance Relationship). We meet up, but not often at all atm, so I can't take care of him myself. He goes days without eating or drinking, wastes all his time on nothing but games that he doesn't even enjoy, told me he feels like everything is just senseless and pointless and it saddens and worries me a lot.

134,"okay so, i have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for about a year and 3 months, we have always lived together, from the very beginning. but we have recently had to start doing long distance. we moved to a bigger city together to live with her mom and I just ended up not liking it there. so I moved back to my small town. this change is very hard for me because I have separation anxiety, because of this it feels like a part of me is missing. I have become very depressed and worried about my mental health. I try to communicate with her as much as I can but it doesnt seem like I'm getting the same from her and. I know she loves me but I have borderline personality disorder, therefore it is very hard for me to adapt to this change. every time we are arguing or talking about something that bothers me, and theres nothing I can do about it. I get really bad anxiety when this happens and I have explained this to her many times, but she still does it. She says I just use it to get her attention.

135,"In middle and high school I was quite successful. I had a very high GPA with most semesters being straight A's, I received numerous awards and recognition for my hard work and academic achievement, started college (in 2013) early in my junior year of high school, and served as student body president my junior and senior year of high school (graduated high school in 2015).

&amp;#x200B;

I started experiencing mental health problems in high school, but shrugged them off as nothing. The symptoms kept getting worse, but I just kept my focus on studying. Then the brain fog and cognitive impairment got to a point where I could no longer read, think, or memorize functionally as a student. I performed terribly that semester in all my classes failing two of them for the first time, and was forced to take a semester off. Since then I haven't been the same. I haven't graduated yet even though I had a two year head start. I was forced to withdraw a second time last year due to the same reasons I dropped out the first time. I've seen so many doctors, specialists, counselors, and therapists. I changed my diet to healthy one, exercise everyday now, and meditate too. I feel like I've done so many things to manage my mental health yet the results are unsatisfactory. In February I ended my sessions with my therapist because I thought I have finally escaped depression and anxiety, but it's back and I'm embarrassed to return. I can't get myself together and nothing seems clear to me. My mom is so done with me and very disappointed in what I've become. Now I'm a 22 year old college dropout working a minimum wage job. I'm so scared to show my face in public because so many of my high school peers would be surprised to see how far I've fallen.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do anymore. Being in academia was my identity, and now I'm terrified of school. I don't know who I am anymore. The only thing in life that I was good at was school, and now I can't even think about my university or else my heart starts to race. I can't believe my reality right now. Everyday feels like a really bad dream. The symptoms of depression and anxiety keep getting worse. There have been small successes in recent times where I would achieve the highest score in class, but I don't feel good about it. Instead I feel really empty and that I've underachieved. As a kid I only knew happiness, stability, and curiosity, and now my life is hell. I don't know what I did to my brain for it to betray me like this. My body and brain are so tired even though sleep longer than I should. And when I try to do something good for myself it's like my body is resisting me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to return to school for fall semester, but I don't believe in myself anymore. I can only run away from depression and anxiety for so long until they catch up again and ruin me. By now I should have been in medical school finishing up my masters degree. Now I can't even see myself finishing my bachelors. I had so much going for me and everyone around me thought I'd be successful. There's so much I want to say, but I can't express myself. I am so done with myself. I can't believe I've come to this low of a point. I'm so tired of using all my time and energy to barely manage depression and anxiety. There is nothing I look forward to. I feel like this is it. I feel like my end is coming soon.",23May2019,2

Into police crying and begging to get convicted. It’s always been stupid things like driving a car with invalid insurance, runs a red light then turns himself in paranoid he is going to prison and can’t live with the worry and just wants to get the conviction over and done, he was using drugs and got caught and was given a probation which he broke when he went and bought some anyway then freaked out binned them down a river and ran to police in a state saying he is going to court.

142,"I've been diagnosed with depression and GAD in the past, mostly through my teens and early twenties. I've never taken medication for it besides an occasional xanax for airplanes or panic attacks. I'll usually have a depressive spiral, 2 or 3 days where I can't get out of bed and cry, every few months but nothing that really affects my day-to-day experience. But lately, my panic attacks are getting far more regular. Like one every week almost. I'm finding myself easily overstimulated by people and noise. I'm starting to feel like I'm disassociating, thinking I'm in purgatory and that I've lived my life more than once. Like, actually unhinged thoughts. When I go out with friends, I just look at everyone like they're already old or dead. I'm constantly living in the past or the future. I don't enjoy my hobbies, it's hard to create anything anymore. My memory has gone to shit and it's difficult to measure time. My thoughts are loud, disorganized, and blown way out of proportion (like it might start with me being worried about a bill and in the course of a few minutes I'm sobbing over climate change and every animal that's ever lived and every horror that's ever happened). My symptoms are becoming nonsensical and honestly hard to deal with. I've been gaslighting myself about it but it's getting hard to deal. I'm also become somewhat of a hypochondriac and feel like everything is a serious problem and I'm in my late 20s so I'm getting scared I might develop schizophrenia or something. I don't know.

143,"I have friends who I see from time to time, and who I go to church with. These people make me feel like I’m important to them when we are one on one, but in public I’m ignored like I don’t exist. I hate feeling childish and petty, but no one ever posts pictures of me with them on instagram. I get told what a wonderful person I am, how I go out of my way for them, then they go and post all these selfies with other people and post how wonderful of a friend THEY are and how they couldn’t live without them. Idk if it’s because I’m an embarrassment. Although I am pretty, I am overweight...but even my friends who are overweight are like this too.

I always see close friends hang out with each other. Taking random “girls trips” to the coast, to ikea, even Las Vegas. When I say “hey, you should have invited me!” They get real short and say “this was planned a long time ago”. I have a friend I’ve known for over 20 years and we were best friends. She’s invited me to some things, but now she has all these random friends she introduces as her “best friends “, takes tons of pictures with them, and can barely muster up that I’m even her friend when she introduces me. Then I get asked to give people rides home like that’s all I’m there for. 

I feel so guilty caring about this. Every day I want to cry then tell myself who cares? Who needs friends? Labels like best friend is stupid and I shouldn’t even care. But I want to feel loved and valued, not used.

I think this is deeply rooted in my upbringing...I know these are insecurities. But it’s hard feeling alone. If social media is fake, then these people are fake and why should I bother? I’ve been so depressed about this lately. I know people are gonna say dump them and find new friends. But who? Even when I make new friends I’m treated like this.

NOTE: I am open about my mental illness, but I hide my behavior around everyone, so I know that’s not the reason.

Can I get some advice on this?

145,"We split up last summer, and it was amicable and we planned to stay in touch - but sometime during the fall we went ""no contact"" because a new guy she was seeing was jealous of us staying in touch.

One would think the worst of it would be the beginning and it would slowly get better, but in reality my feelings about it have only gotten worse and worse to the point that it interferes with my life every day.

I have an extremely vivid memory of our relationship, the sound of her voice, the exactly layout and decorations of her apartment, etc.  And especially the exact words said in some of our last conversations.  I can't stop thinking things like ""what if I had said x instead of y"".  I had a million chances to save the relationship, not take her for granted, etc, but I was too blind to see it in the moment.  My regrets keep building and building.

I've had trouble getting over people before but never to this extent.  Also when I was growing up I had social and attention difficulties.  Some potential diagnoses were suggested/thrown around including ADD, Asperger's, OCD, Social anxiety, but the only one that really stuck was called central auditory processing disorder (which honestly I think was just a garbage diagnosis, at least for me).  Labels aside, I have a very difficult time paying attention to what's happening in the moment and I'm almost constantly daydreaming.  And when I'm depressed and upset like I am now, it's even harder to snap out of daydreaming mode.

147,"Ok guys, i wrote this like 3-4 times, so I hope someone will understand and help me with this.
First of all, my parents relationship is that one you see in romantic movies where they love after 30 years (that's the mariage age) the same as the first day.
Then, the mother-son relationship, is like: we go out to eat, have fun, judge people for fun, talk shit, talk non stop (irl/wapp), go shopping stupid things, we are literally best friends.

Now the problem:
One day (aprox one month ago), she ""woke up"" in some weird mental state (trance?! depression?! middle age crysis?!) where she doesn't give a fuck about me and my brother, not even looking at my father, always finds a reason to leave home (with her women friends), now she literally found a reason to get in a fight with my dad (because he told his mom about her state) and left home, she never acted like this before, i mean, she was crying everytime i was missing home some days (i'm almost 22). My dad never done anything bad, now he's pretty desperate and I'm worried about him because he's suffering a lot, always talking to me about how much he wants to know her problem and help her, started giving her gifts (more than usual, we have a very bad financial state because our gov literally stole half his incomes, he is retired military fireman), and he got a bad heart, he had a stroke about half an year ago where he was ""the luckiest person alive"" because most people die from that, he only lost sight with half an eye. 
So here I am, asking for advice from you and for an answer, what could have caused her this thing? Until now, I can only think about menopause, not eating diet (she does that) or some middle age crysis? But this can't just happen overnight?! 
She's not cheating, she didn't find anyone else, she didn't get with any weird people, she just changed her mind about anything overnight and she's not willing to talk about it with anyone.
So what the hell is her problem?
How can we help her?
How can I help my father at least?
Any help, advice, anything would be great and if you're a mother, or your wife, or your mother have been thru this, tell me how to fix this or at least tell me I can't

I'm in the UK so we get 12 sessions, for one hour each, then we've got to wait six months before we re-refer and have to go on a waiting list again.

-terrified someone is trying to kill me/ for example shooting me through my front door, window or letter box. 
- extremely paranoid about coincidences for example I keep looking at the clock at 3:33am and I’ve become extremely superstitious about this. 
- I also get terrified of any strangers that pass me on the street, whether that’s about this pulling a knife out on me, or if the strangers are actually working together to attack me

160,"I’m at 17M in high school that has been doing some self reflecting. I have been struggling with depression and loneliness for a while now. Let me start off by saying I live in a good family and I have plenty to be grateful for. When I was about 9 my mothers alcoholism really started to show. She began drinking excessively and I remember times when she was blacked when it was just me and her in the house. Luckily she received help over about a two year period but my father was an out of town worker, so constantly I was left with my younger sisters and babysitters. This I think made me develop severe anxiety to the point were I would miss weeks of school simply due to pure fear of the leaving the house. My father isn’t big on mental health so he truly didn’t understand and often yelled at me for not wanting to go to school. This truly made it worse. Eventually my mother came back from treatment and she said she would never leave again. Now of course she relapsed and left for another year, but the only reason I mention it is because that is her worst worry. That I would never forgive her for leaving after promising to never leave again. I never thought anything of it but she makes it a big deal. Now she is sober for something like 5 years and I’m in no fear of her relapsing. Today, I’m in my junior year of high school and I dont have the same anxiety issues, but the the relationship anxiety still occurs strongly. For instance I see others with friends and become extremely lonely or I I’m always checking up on my girlfriend ect. I just am never in the moment I guess. I guess my biggest question is does my past with my mothers absence have anything to do with my clinginess and loneliness? It’s just hard for me to understand why I fell this way when I have friends and a SO.

I do not mean to offend anybody that is dealing with serious abandonment issues, and believe me I am very happy to have my mother back.
