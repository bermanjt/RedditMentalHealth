0,"Everyone close to me tells me I have an eating disorder but I don’t believe I do. I feel like I’m very normal looking, maybe even bigger than average. I also feel like I eat all the time. I just workout a lot but what healthy person shouldn’t do that? Anyway, I thought I was alright but I stepped on the scale today and saw I went from 98 to 77. I just don’t know how this can be when I believe I’m eating so much and being so healthy and still look so big. I just don’t feel comfortable if I’m lazy or sitting still, but I just thought these were things to be proud of. I just don’t know and I can’t confine in my family about this because I’m sure it will freak them out.

1,"I guess I’m having an inner crisis. I was depressed for a while, I was suicidal everyday while being homeschooled. I was set to go to a public school on September 3rd after finishing homeschool on July 23rd, and I finally got out of the suicidal rut I was in. 

Then I started going to school and everything was ok. Sure I had different expectations but it wasn’t as bad as I thought. 

Everything is meh. It’s rewarding to be praised for the work you do and you complete, but it’s also depressing realizing how bad you are at certain subjects, and feeling like nobody wants to talk to you willingly and would gladly use you, and how your basically gone from your family all day almost.

I feel like I’m not happy anywhere
I’ve become emotionless and blank. I feel like a robot. I literally don’t care about anything besides grades and family.  I’ve also become withdrawn, I just want to stay alone all day.

I always just say I don’t have energy or I’m socially drained, but deep down I know I’m slipping back into depression. 

My whole day I’m just like “fuck this, I don’t fucking care about a thing”.

Anyone have any suggestions on how I can be myself truly and be at peace with myself?",20Sep2019,1
2,"A lot of strange things have been happening to me lately. Yesterday morning, I woke up and my heart was racing and I felt so afraid. The air in my room felt, heavier...if that’s makes any sense. I look around me and it felt like the darkness was...moving. I looked at my phone and it was 3:45am...and I was WIDE awake! Not tired at all. I couldn’t go back to sleep so I stayed awake until I had to start getting ready for work.

 Later on that day at my desk, I hear someone whisper my name. I looked around and there was no one around. I brushed it off because to be honest...I’ve been hearing my name being whispered since I was child but I wrote it off as an overactive imagination (or possible mental illness) Anyway, during my lunch break, I’m eating lunch outside and Honey bees start to fly around me...landing on me. It was so strange. A few minutes later I’m scrolling on IG and I find out that a childhood friend of mine had passed away around 3:30am that morning. I was SHOOK...to my core. I couldn’t even think straight the rest of my shift. 

My shift ends and I’m driving back home and a honey bee flies into my car and lands on the passenger seat. I thought of my childhood friend and burst into tears. And this isn’t the only event that has happened that I can’t logically explain. I’m a FULLY functioning adult! I live on my own, I financially Independent...I eat pretty healthy and I workout regularly...but at the same time, I’m starting to feel like my plants are...alive! I mean, scientifically speaking, they really are alive but I feel something...different coming from my plants.

I’ve sought help from a therapist....even admitted myself into a mental health unit at at hospital. Even after I describe my experiences to the psychologist, they would diagnose me with Mild depression...and would say that I’m a “self reflective, perceptive, adult woman” Okay?!? 



I’m afraid because my worst fear (besides being locked up in a place where I’m not able to come and go as I please) is losing control of my mind. I’m looking for answers in spiritual texts and even YouTube videos...some of it aligns but most of it I can’t relate to. I don’t know what happening to me...and I need answers. I just don’t know where to look. I’ve looked inward...I’ve looked outward. And what I see does not make sense anymore.",20Sep2019,1

5,I’m not sure if this is in the right category but i struggle with depression and anxiety and for the last few years I’ve noticed I don’t really eat much. It’s not because I think I’m fat or anything it’s just because unless I’m starving I don’t really see the point in eating. I don’t feel like making food ever and at times I can’t bring myself to eat. I only eat one meal a day most days and that’s breakfast . Other days I eat 2. But I eat very little . Just enough so that I don’t starve but not enough to make me full . Sometimes this backfires and I get severe headaches and nausea . But I still can’t bring myself to eat very much . Does this sound like some sort of eating disorder or is it likely just the depression ?,20Sep2019,1
6,"seems like they're a lot more marginalized than a lot of other groups of mental disorders. in the eyes of the media, they're all labeled as ""cold, unfeeling, don't care at all about anything or anyone else, will trick you into liking them so they can manipulate you, dangerous and careless, etc etc"" and it gives the impression that they're all terrible human beings that should be avoided at all costs, and you should be afraid of ever encountering one. i mean, i get it, someone who can't feel empathy seems like a scary thought. that's not to say they don't feel other emotions, have morals, and can even care about friends/family/pets. some sociopaths are dangerous, but definitely not all of them. 

i just think it's pretty damaging to label them all as these monsters who we need to watch out for. i mean, they are people after all, we all have our thoughts. it sucks that there's this stigma around them, probably stops a lot of them from seeking help, or seeing themselves as anything other than a monster. really sucks.

soundcloud, then I aksed why she did like that, and whoaa she said:

I was addicted to people's opinions and that could change things I like and interests and what she valued, so she doesn't share to anyone her songs

Also when we were staying on crosswalk I started talking about this topic again and she said also she doesn't has favourite movies

When I said opinions is more like person created something in their mind and saying it is true believe me everyone, and that there's FACTS (not opinions it doesn't exist, facts exist)

She admitted it 

I think she has DPD (Dependent personality disorder)

10,"So I used to have an eating disorder when I was 16-18, but don’t believe I do anymore. I noticed I was getting heavy (I’m 20 now) and started to watch what I ate and worked out as often as I could. Working out has kind of been my every day medicine and I feel like I eat so much. If I eat something unhealthy or a little higher in calories, I do triple the workout, which i believe any healthy person would do. My family has been commenting on my body for weeks, telling me I’m disordered, and that I look sick but I just don’t believe them. I believe that I eat all the time and look average or even bigger than average, but they still comment. Because of this, I’ll usually wear tons of layers or hide in my room when everyone is home, just so they won’t comment on my body. Just two weeks ago, I went to my PC and got weighed, layered up because I’m a naturally cold person, and was 98 pounds. (I’m 5’1) but today, I weighed myself and realized I’m 77...

12," I thought this might be an appropriate place to post this. I could really use some feedback and advice so thank you in advance for taking the time to read and/or respond to this. I've been struggling with this specific issue for about 2 years now. I've had severe anxiety associated with going to my local gym, and related concepts. But not for the reasons you might assume. It involves anxiety, depression, shame and patterns of OCD. Sorry if this is too long. I need to work on being more concise I suppose. Writing is cathartic for me.

**Background: (maybe skip the background if you don't have the time)**

I used to work with a guy 5 years ago. Let's call him John. We became friends through working and started spending time together outside of work. He has a very outgoing, risk-taking, care-free personality. He's 5 years older than me. John has a somewhat troubled past and spent a small amount of time in jail for theft, has been charged with multiple DUI's, etc. John would come into work high on a combination of drugs basically every day and on multiple occasions I even saw him selling drugs on work property. He's no boy scout. Personally, I've never been in any serious trouble and my worst offense is a speeding ticket. I liked hanging out and talking to this guy, pretty standard stuff.

He ended up stealing money from our company and I caught him doing it. He actually admitted to me he was doing it because he thought he could trust me and to be honest, it was not a large amount of money that he stole, though it did happen on multiple occasions. He was also considered one of the managers at this company, while I was just a regular employee. I did not say anything to anyone for about a month and asked him several times if he would just return the money that he stole, but he refused.

I tend to obsess about things and create narratives in my mind that cause me a lot of anxiety. I began feeling guilt about not reporting this crime and I created a narrative in my mind that it was somehow my fault and that he would be found out and I would end up being charged with a crime for not stopping him. I felt terrible for about a month before finally reporting it to one of the managers. I just couldn't stand the guilt and shame anymore, despite it being such a relatively minor, victim-less crime that I witnessed. This was a summer job that ended at the end of August and I ended up reporting it in the beginning of September, about 5 years ago. Because of the nature of the job, there was a police officer in the same building of the place the manager I reported it to was working in, and so they promptly got me to report the crime to the police officer as well. Then I left, knowing my friend would likely get into serious trouble, and that he would know it was me who sold him out, and that we would no longer be friends. But to me this was better than living with constant guilt, and I did feel some relief after reporting it. Still, I continued to feel anxious and shameful that I reported my friend's crime, that I might have to give the police more info, or that I might be called to testify in court, etc.

My life went on. I was spending most of my time going to college. I no longer contacted John, and hoped to leave him in the past. I later found out that he was called in for questioning, but nothing ever came from it. John was never charged with a crime, there was never a trial, basically nothing bad happened as a result. I had planned on never returning to that job and I knew John planned on never returning as well. John knew it was me that sold him out and told mutual friends that he hated me for it. But I was just glad it was over with. Most of our coworkers never learned what happened. I never saw John for a couple years, but we still lived in the same town.

**(End of background)**

I have always been a big fan of athletics and since about 18, I've worked out regularly at gyms. I was working out a particular gym for a while, until a group of friends convinced me to join a different gym. I liked this new gym a lot and enjoyed working out by myself and with others there. After going for a couple weeks, I notice a familiar face. My former friend John (significance explained in background section above) goes to this gym. The shame and anxiety came flooding back. I ignored him the first few times I saw him there but eventually I knew there needed to be some kind of interaction between us. To cut to the chase, he never showed any kind of animosity toward me at this new gym. He never said or did anything that would make one believe he resents me for the past, and was actually pretty nice, as usual. I still felt that deep down he must have been harboring negative thoughts toward me, and I continued to feel shame for what had happened.

The gym went from being my happy place to a place of torment. I began feeling severe anxiety about having to go to the gym and cross paths with John. Every day at work I would feel increasing dread as gym time approached. I would feel so anxious that it became difficult to focus on anything else. But I never stopped going to the gym. I felt that my workouts were suffering because I would always show up to the gym in a terrible mood, I would feel anxious and distracted the whole time and I would leave in a terrible mood. As if it weren't difficult enough to stay on a strict gym routine, I developed this additional burden. Then I would feel terrible about how I'm wasting my potential at the gym and underachieving.

I continued to work out 5 times a week, feeling anxious all day about going to the gym, feeling bad while there, and feeling bad afterwards. I couldn't bring myself to stop going but I strongly considered switching gyms. I would only cross paths with John about 1/5 of the times I was there, but the looming feeling never left. I always felt an anxious association and dealing with it made me more depressed than I already was in general. Despite John not showing any signs of ill will, I felt shame about his existence there. We even joked and talked when we ran into each other, although I was only interacting with him because I thought it might help me feel better. But I just couldn't seem to shake the guilt or the negatives associated with this new gym.

A newer gym opened in town not long after, and it was nicer and cheaper than the current gym so we switched. I felt huge relief that I would no longer have to cross paths with John at the gym. My anxiety started dropping, and I started enjoying my workouts more. My only anxiety stemmed from the possibility of John switching to this nicer gym too. And after about a month, he of course showed up at this gym too. The anxiety came back. Same routine. I felt helpless and like I would never escape this. Fortunately, he rarely showed up to this gym. For the next 3 months I saw him 3-4 times at this gym, and then never again. I still feared that he would show up at any moment so the anxiety continued. I've been going to this gym for a little over a year now and learned a couple months ago that he no longer has a membership at this gym. I felt relief at learning this and thought I might finally be past this. But the anxiety continued because I've built up such a strong associations with the gym being a place to fear, and feel anxious about.

Throughout this whole ordeal, thoughts of fitness, mentions of gyms, workout routines, etc. have triggered my anxiety and so I've avoided talking or thinking about them, but I've continued to show up and work hard. But I just feel like I can't shake this association and that's what I need help with.

I have talked in depth with my therapist about this over the past year and a half but I have yet to fully overcome this issue. I have come to terms with the fact that: I did nothing wrong in the scenario with John, I have no reason to feel shame or anxiety about it, John doesn't seem to care about what happened anymore, I have no logical reason to feel shame about this, etc. I've tried focusing on the good things at the gym: the music I workout to, the attractive women, the progress I'm attempting to make and so forth.

I've tried mediation, weekly therapy, challenging my thoughts, etc.

But despite there being nothing in reality that should make me anxious about going to this gym, I can't seem to break the association. Every time I think I'm over it, I get pulled back in. To some extent I'm trying to sabotage myself by using these negative thoughts to bring myself down, but the awareness of this does not seem to allow me to overcome it

I feel like I'm stuck in a rut with being unable to progress in my life because I have this constant anxious routine about going to the gym, and most days it feels like I'm just existing to survive those feelings, rather than making progress in my general life goals. It feels like one of those problems that I can't overcome because there's nothing in reality for me to conquer. It's all a narrative I have constructed and despite knowing how illogical it is, I still feel terrible about it. There's no concrete resolution it seems. It's negatively affecting every aspect of my life and I hate it. I feel so stuck in not being able to change my thought patterns. Fitness is a very crucial part of my life, and I have a routine of going 5 times a week. I can't see myself walking away from it.

I just can't seem to let this anxious association go. What tips do you guys have for this? Anything I haven't tried? I have considered switching to yet another gym, but my therapist has told me not to as this is just running away from the problem and not confronting it.

I have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and depending on which therapist you ask, OCD. I have been medicated for these in the past but I'm not currently being medicated, although I am considering getting back on some kind of medication.

**TL;DR: Guy I have a rocky past with went to same gym as me. I felt very anxious about him being there despite there being no animosity between us. He stopped going. I still go regularly. Despite him not going anymore, I have built up strong negative associations with going to this gym and it's affecting my workouts and everyday life as I continue to feel terrible about the gym and the idea of going to this gym. Looking for advice on how to fully overcome this.**

16,"So, to give some background, I'm a female high school student and have had depressive symptoms since 6th grade or when I was 11. 

During July I went to the hospital alone, and was told I didn't need my parents with me. I went there to find a psychiatrist to finally get help and used my chest pain as an excuse to be there. 

I was there for hours, I had told my parents I was with friends, and expected to be home before my mom came home. The psychiatrist told me I wasn't allowed to leave without my parents knowing and basically forced me to stay overnight. I cried as my family came to visit me and refused to talk. I didn't want them to find out this way. Since I was a minor and had self harming thoughts before I was watched by a security guard in the psychiatric unit the whole night. I cried a lot and couldn't sleep.

I was recommended to a place with counselors or therapists for adolescents and met a very nice therapist there. She wasn't very helpful, but was very nice and caring. I tried all the methods she gave me and worked really hard to form better habits but it didn't help my mood, even after a month and a half. She then recommended me to see a psychiatrist with her. 

My therapist had reassured me and told me I'd probably get medication. We saw the psychiatrist together, and there was also a psychiatrist in training there. I cried, explaining my difficult moments, and they spoke with my dad. They came to the conclusion that I should have family therapy and I wouldn't get to see my current therapist anymore. That made me cry a lot. I had expected medication and nothing else, not trying to reason with my family who never cared about my mental health. I read about the benefits of medication, I expected it because of my therapist. So I made sure I didn't have to get family therapy.

But since my therapist was saw people short term and was only there to help people get back on their feet and find the right path for them, I couldn't see her anymore either way. She recommended I see the school counselor, and now I'm waiting to see her. 

Overall, even though I expected I'd find the help I needed and get better, I barely made any progress. Some symptoms got worse, and I know my school counselor won't be able to help me. 

Summary:
After seeking help for my mental health everything I've been working on is gone now and I'm back to square one. Seeking help has helped others but it clearly didn't help me. Now I'm lost and I dont know what to do.",20Sep2019,3

21,"Heya r/mentalhealth,  


One and a half years ago I finally made the decision to overcome my anxiety to seek professional help and actually do something that would make me feel better in the long run. After suffering from years of depression and major social anxiety issues I felt that I owed it to myself - I still do think that way.   
Here's the catch, I've wrote to countless psychiatrists and never had a positive response come my way.   
I live in one of the bigger cities in Germany, so there is plenty of opportunities - so I thought.   
Back when I was in my bubble and didn't have the mental strength to think about seeking help I already heard of the problem of a shortage of psychiatrists, but it never occured to me that it's that severe.

I'm at a point in my life where I will *live*, but I feel like I shouldn't be using my time like I have been for the past 15 years - hiding from my anxiety.  
I **want** to seek help, I just don't know how.  


Here's the original question, did anyone of you have a similar experience and how did you bypass it?   
Did you just keep trying?  
Bonus points if you can give me an advice regarding finding help in Germany specifically.  


Cheers,

So in my past I've had between 5-8 confirmed concussions. From hockey, messing around as a kid and work. I'm only 18 and I have been suffering from depression  for as long as I can remember, my anxiety wasn't as bad until I started drinking and smoking weed but now I only drink. When I was smoking I would have the most intense unimaginable panic attacks. I think I'm an alcoholic as well and I get very stressed easily to the point where I start screaming or punching shit. I get depressed normally at night or when I'm just home or doing the things I use to love and things that are nostalgic or cause me to think about the past make it worse. Everything just feels odd or fake as well   almost like I'm not anywhere I'm living my life. I recognize my self in the mirror but I dont think to myself that's me. I feel like I'm just sort of here. In not afraid of death and I welcome it but I know if someone had a gun to my head I'd be sh*tting myself and I constantly worry about my family and love ones but I dont feel many good emotions.. they all feel sort of suppressed. I have a million plans about my future but the only thing I ever wanted to do I forgot about and I feel like I should be retired. At this point I can imagine living another 50 or 60 years let alone 10. I know im going to have some average job being stressed the rest of my life so I always feel like if ve better off dead. I've planned ways to die, and I constantly think about dying though I believe I'd never go through with it. Unless if it came down to a bottle of whiskey and a gun then I'd probably have the courage to shoot myself in the head or at least attempt it lol. 

I'd love to goto therapy and get help but I know chances are there just going to give me drugs. And I dont even know where to go. There is only 1 clinic here open 3 hours a day 5 days a week and I dont have a doctor yet... probably not for another few months but I'm in desperate need of help. Every night I goto bed thinking  if I'm going to die I'd rather die in my sleep.  Please read my other thread here there are alot more details but I diddnt get too much advise I find   thank you.",20Sep2019,1

Now I've always been a dog person, but I miss that cat. It was always nice to come home to it after work and even on days where the depression was rough and my family/friends were unavailable, that cat was a little beam of sunshine. This is all despite the fact that she's (the cat) is an asshole who likes to chew on fingers and runs around like a banshee.

I've been trying to separate in my head if I want a pet or an emotional support animal. I want to understand my motivations before I bring this up with a professional. In your experience has an emotional support animal helped you? I dont want to be just another millennial with an ""ESA"" because my landlord won't let me have a pet",20Sep2019,1

32,"i remember last year i really had a crush on this girl, hannah. i eventually got her phone number and we talked. thinking that she was into me, i flirted a lot, until one day i found out she had a girlfriend (we're both pansexual. its for the story.) the moment i found out, i apologized instantly, and we ended up becoming close friends. we talked about getting together over summer, but nothing really happened.

one day, when we were talking one day either last month or earlier this month, she said that she actually had a crush on me the same time i did.

there was this guy named daniel. he dated my friend hayleigh's friend, and then broke up with her, going straight for another girl named gracie. two weeks ago he broke up with gracie. he went on hannah. and ive been emotional ever since.

they started dating maybe last week, or this week. i was very upset. i told my friend aiden that daniel was a super big asshole. out of curiousity, aiden asked me what made him a dick. i couldnt think of a response. i basically told him that daniel cant keep a relationship and he always goes straight to another girl.

aiden says that i love hannah. i instantly reply with ""what? no im not! i dont feel like i am!""

he says he knows more about love than i do. i somewhat agree, considering the fact that hes 1 grade above me and almost 2 years older than i am.

now, thats the first question. is aiden right, am i really in love???

today, hannah let me read her notebook. hannah kept writing how perfect daniel is, and so on. i feel like shit. i act like it doesnt effect me, but the moment i get home, i write in my notebook.

i tell her exactly how i feel about everything, and everything thats been going around this situation. she starts crying the moment she reads my message. ((ik she actually was bc she sent me a picture of it for proof. also, i didnt ask for proof, she just felt like she had to send it.))

we go on talking for about an hour. she says she feels terrible, and she constantly apologized for ""being an asshole.""

i try to reassure her that she isnt an asshole and that shes ok, and she shouldnt feel upset.

here comes the second question. am i an asshole???

please help. idk how to move on. i guess i need someone to talk about the situation but idk.

The trauma related to the PTSD as well as a lot of other unfortunate events throughout my life have given me this overwhelming fear of abandonment. My partner and I are completely open about this and he has always given me room to air out my fears and reassures me as much as he can. I still fear at times though that he is going to “change his mind about me” or decide that I’m “too much.” He has never done anything but support me and encouraged me to seek therapy (I wasn’t for a period of time), and he goes to therapy as well.

And yet, I still feel afraid at times that he’s going to disappear, even after two years together. Does anyone else struggle with this? I feel so hopeless sometimes because I know my fear isn’t based in fact, but it almost feels like the longer we are together the more likely my mind feels like he will leave me one day without a trace.

36,"*note* - some thing’s might trigger &amp; im sorry in advance
 
I really don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to seem like I’m desperate for attention ; that’s the last thing I want. I just have a hard time expressing my emotions to others or even myself. I feel as if I’m a burden? I honestly think it’s just how I was raised.. being told that “men are to not have emotions” &amp; that “emotions make you weak.” All that toxic masculinity bullshit. I’ve tried everything under the sun to cope with my emotions &amp; “stabilize” myself but actually taking the time to express myself. I’ve self medicated most of my life , beginning in 7th grade until I graduated high school. Been clean off opiates &amp; benzos for 3 years come November 2019. I’ve also seen psychiatrist’s and most of them are either afraid or surprised that I’m functioning in society without actual medication for my mental state. 

I find myself having days or weeks &amp; sometimes months where I’m just completely a different person. I lose all interest in everything. I just go to work &amp; come straight home. That’s it. I’ve been told I’m bi polar from many doctors &amp; that I get it from my biological mother. She was diagnosed with many disorders &amp; eventually passed away due to an OD or possible brain issue. She was a paranoid schiz , who had severe anxiety &amp; manic depression &amp; she also was bi polar. I don’t think I’m bi polar but then some days I believe I am. I do have anxiety &amp; depression but some days are better than others. I’m just going thru the time of emotional unstableness. Like I am energetic and happy at work then once I am on the road heading home I completely turn into an angry monster &amp; now I’m crying when I finally get settled in and ready for bed. Ready to expire... 

I know I’m not the only one with problems &amp; I don’t want to be treated any different than the average person. I just need help with learning to talk instead of letting everything bottle up. I’m sure that’s why I’m so emotionally unstable.  Should I go back to a psychiatrist &amp; try to get some medication?? Or should I just be all natural and learn coping mechanisms &amp; to learn how to express myself naturally. 

Any response is appreciated. I know I jumped all over the place with this but it’s just how my mind is at the moment. Thank you for reading this.",20Sep2019,3

The bottom of my spine is fused wrong. Constant pain and pain killers making me a zombie. I don't really socialize in order to keep straight A's and do introverted hobbies (I have one best friend but she's moved away and is an amazing person). All I do is draw and write my book in my dorm room hoping my roomate stays out late. Shes a gorgeous and wonderful person I look up to and fear her. I cant make eye contact. Sound kills me. I can't fucking take it anymore. 

On top of being constantly anxious, having hallucinations (ive seen ""ghosts"" and ""demons"" since i was a child but i boil it down to stress?) I can't fucking stand sound. This is something i noticed since i was 8(?). 

Around 8 i was raped by my dad's friend. I'll never tell my family of course and its been too long to report him. I have no evidence. I don't want to act like a victim but all of my fucking issues were never THERE BEFORE HE DID IT. I can't even hold a conversation with a guy who's into me without knowing im worthless sexually and can't give him emotional love or physical love. 

Okay. Back to the sound. I got off track very dramatically. 

Sound. Chewing. Talking in different languages. Talking loudly. Singing in public. Coughing. Sniffing. Rubbing hands. Book pages. My proffesor stuttering. His chalk on the board. The girl tapping on her laptop. The guy next to me as his pant leg brushes the other. Tapping. Eating. Swallowing. Grunting. Breathing. Walking heavy. Laughing. Crying. 

The list goes on and lately it's getting longer. I want to cry. I dont want to be a hateful person and succomb to all of this. I love seeing people happy and I can't stand listening to them laugh. I wish life was a silent movie. 

I can't interact with the world but i love to see it happy. I want to be happy with it but i can't stand being around it. 

How the fuck am I going to function out of college. How am i gonna make it. 

I think im getting really depressed. My heart is racing typing this because i know someone won't believe me. I'm so scare someone is going to call me out for lying. That this many things cant possibly be wrong with me. I can't tell you why. I want to know to why I can't get through the day without breaking down at night when everything is dark and silent and perfect.

40," I’m sorry this is kind of long and it’s going to be hard to really explain everything but will try my best...My parents divorced at a young age and I believe it morphed me into a very extreme perfectionist person with other problems(possibly some unrelated to events in life but more genetic). One of my earliest signs was a sort of quick pacing in a room where I would have a flood of comforting thoughts, when I was younger it’d be thoughts of me and my parents back together or now that I’m older (18) it more involves ego boosting thoughts like me dominating in sports in front of girls that I like or playing on stage (depending on my passion at the point in my life) It is almost a way to make me feel optimistic and better amidst signs of anxiety or depression, but I have no idea what you would call it. I get a big rush of dopamine when I do the quick pacing and thinking. Possibly related to overactivity of the brain?  Anyways, I was and am still today a very social outgoing person and would consider myself very attractive. I became very self conscious in middle school and would say I had body dysmorphic disorder most likely also fueled by this perfectionist mindset. Then, early in middle school soon after this body dysmorphic disorder manifestation I hooked up with a girl and failed to get an erection which I realized was performance anxiety. That night  stayed with me a lot throughout high school. I’ve had a couple hookups where I’ve relaxed and maintained an erection, and had a girlfriend who I was able to have solid sex with (although I’d still have handful of times getting anxiety and losing my erection.) This caused a lot of insecurity and stress for me especially in high school and now I’m in college and am trying to work past it along with my other insecurities. The thought of really like a beautiful girl and then being too caught up in my problems to open up and failing to have good sex haunts me. This body dysmorphic disorder towards the end of highschool really took a hold of the acne I had  and now after treatment only scarring remains. I completely hide this acne scarring on my forehead with my hair and after 2 years no one besides my parents know I even have any. You could imagine the situations I’ve gotten out of or the constant anxiety I’ve had to make sure no blow of wind or anything uncovered my forehead up close. Anyways, it is much better but under certain lighting it doesn’t look how I would like it to yet so my body still holds on to this insecurity and I’m constantly checking it under different lighting, some lightings I look completely clear and others I’m very critical and it looks awful and the thought of a bad lighting hitting it makes me extremely insecure to where I don’t want to open up to anyone at all. What keeps me somewhat sane is that I’m doing treatments for the scarring. When I had the girlfriend in high school I probably started to feel the most confident as I didn’t have as much acne and wasn’t as obsessed over other body dysmorphia. When I got the acne I kind of avoided the embarrassment by promptly ending the relationship. While I realize I have self image, insecurity and anxiety problems looking back this makes me feel as I can be comfortable in a relationship once this acne scarring improves and I do my best to be open and comfortable with different girls. I believe all these problems come from the same root though and I’ve also gotten unlucky in certain situations like anyone but this deep insecurity massively fuels it. Obviously we are our worst critics so I really hold on to these things. The depression that comes along with it is usually fought with visions of a future of maximum success and peace of mind(which I’m not sure is very healthy either as I’m repetitively “procrastinating” a likely unattainable vision.) Anyways, if anyone could relate or has advice it would be greatly appreciated to let me know! Sorry for the length of the text and thank you for reading. Writing my problems out feels good either way!

Sometimes when we hang out I feel drained but then I'd feel guilty if I were to drop her as a friend so I promised myself I'd stand by her and remember the good things about her.

I always tell her that if she wants to change her life she needs to allow herself to embrace what is uncomfortable because that is the only way you can get better at something.

I understand that the emotions are true and difficult to manage, yet I also feel like it is her responsibility to choose to be happy and change her life.

54,"We used to be best friends practically. Now he really just says nothing. All because for some reason he's been influenced by my brother. It really all started with my sister. Who is extremely rude and difficult. She used to talk to me any ole kind of rude way. So, basically she put me in bad spirits. There was no stopping her. So, my unresolved anger towards my sister put me in a sour mood when it came to the rest of my family. I guess overtime they had all had enough and stopped respecting me and talking to me. Well, they just didn't understand my dilemma. But, thinking back they were all pretty difficult before I started acting out. Anyways, they've always been intolerant of my despite the fact that I have schizophrenia. The smallest things would make them angry. It's no fun when 3/4 of the family is angry at you. I never left the house because the actual living was too comfortable and on top of that I was high off weed which made me less motivated to leave. Even now the same holds true except i haven't smoked weed in 8 years it's now been replaced with my dad's nasty cigarettes. Tbh I think i was better off smoking weed than cigarettes. But, thinking back i did get pretty paranoid and uncomfortable at times. But, my mood and health were better overall. So, anyways my brother and sister have moved on and my dad basically sits up in the family room all day watching TV and the internet. And basically acts as if i don't exist. I try everything I can to talk to him but he has a passive aggressive look and just brings my overall mood down. Yet if someone comes by he's up and happy, friendly and talkative. So, basically it's not that he doesn't feel like talking to anyone it's just me. Whatever he's angry at he needs to let it go. All the stress is really not good for my schizophrenia. I need s loving and supportive environment. It's very hard to be happy around him. I'd rather be alone in a cabin than be surrounded by people who give me the cold shoulder. I'm really exhausted at this point and it shows. Day after day traumatic experiences take a toll around here. I guess I'll just have to force myself out to a group home or out to the streets. Alone and unloved. I never thought my life would end up like this. His attitude has really changed me for the worst. I don't think anyone really wants me at this point.

Just 2 weeks ago I started to have symptoms of feeling spaced out. I’m Struggling to focus and have the feeling like I’m in a dream almost. I feel out of it and struggle focusing on things. I feel as if Im in tunnel vision but not able to focus on things. I feel mentally slower and it’s hard for me to focus. Its even hard to focus when I talk, listen, or drive.The feeling has not gone away. Also my vision seems to be more blurry than usual. 

I’m not having any other symptoms like night sweats, swollen lymph nodes, fever, unexplained weight loss, headaches, fatigue, or spinning like vertigo. I saw my doctor a week ago and he thought it could be ear related since I’ve had many ear surgeries and told me to take some mucinex pills and nasal spray. Neither has worked so far after a week of trying. I’m not sick, stuffy nosed, or have allergies... I eat very clean and have tried running, dry sauna and a hot tub to see if it would help. Nothing...

I’m worried that I’m getting the starts of Dementia or something else neurological. Im also freaking out about vCJD because I hunted in Wisconsin in a Chronic wasting disease infected county with low rates of infected deer for the past 6 years. Last deer we got was 2,3 and 4 years ago and we never got it tested. 

I’m seriously worried this is the start of dementia and that I’m slowly starting to lose my mind. This feeling just came out of no where 2 weeks ago. Should I go back to my doctor? I’m absolutely freaking out and feel like I’m losing my mind. I can’t focus and feel dazed.

57,"i'm not sure if this is the right sub for this but i would appreciate any ideas/advice if you have any:)

basically, i technically have a diagnosis of anxiety disorder but i don't really agree with it tbh. don't get me wrong, i'm not saying i don't have a problem with feeling anxious (i can admit i do lol) but it's never with actual worries/thoughts. whenever professionals talk about anxiety &amp; ways to cope, they seem to be talking about being overly \*worried\* about possible scenarios, etc. the thing is, thoughts rarely (if ever) set off my anxiety. i will either get a panic/anxiety attack (or whatever you call it idk) from physical things (like being in a crowded place) or just completely out of the blue. the only thoughts that make me more anxious are thinking ""oh no im feeling anxious what if i have a panic attack what am i going to do where will i go"" etc etc (which ik only makes it worse haha)

the only ""trigger"" i can identify is getting overwhelmed when there is too much sound or too many people. i don't really have social anxiety and i'm not worried about them or what they think, it's literally the presence of that much sound/visual input makes my brain freak out. according to my mom i've always been ""sensitive"" like this. i just somehow only struggle with the psychical feelings of 'anxiety' as opposed to the actual thinking worried thoughts. 

so basically...i have no idea what's going on. because its labeled as ""anxiety"" professionals try to help with things like redirecting worry thoughts, etc-- but it doesn't really help me manage my day with the unpredictable ""attacks"" of panic. i feel like my point isn't getting across and i'm just out here trying to feel even just a bit better.

TD;LR- i have diagnosed ""anxiety"" but do not struggle with worry thoughts at all, instead frequent/intense bursts of anxiety/panic that have only kind of gotten worse over the years. the only thing that i can rly identify as a trigger besides randomness is places where it's super crowded or loud and my brain j automatically goes to FREAK OUT MODE ?? overall im just very confused and want any way to kind of help this lol, or explain to my doctors because apparently saying ""no i don't struggle with worrying"" isn't getting the message across",20Sep2019,0

62,"I hope this is the correct sub...if not I apologize. 

Tldr: constant fear of dark, imagining things even though I know nothing is there, what type of help should I seek? 

Hi. 22y old female here and I just have a question. 
So, I've always been afraid of the dark. I tried to break the habit, succeeded for awhile when I started dating my fiancee but I was only successful for about 3 or 4 months. 
The reason I'm so afraid of the dark is because I consistently picture people or figures in the dark. I don't even have to see things like laundry or a lamp that is in a convincing shape. For example, I'll walk past our stairway to our dormer and I'll imagine someone just standing there, despite me knowing theres nothing there. Or if I'm driving at night, I'll imagine a face in my backseat. Or a face staring at me through door cracks or from the closet. It's just a constant, nagging feeling of literally always imagining something there. It's been a fear of mine since I was little.
I know I should seek medical help or advice, but I just wanted to know opinions on what type? Should I do therapy? Look for antianxiety meds? My aunt was schizophrenic but I don't believe I'm having symptoms of it, but I could be wrong. 
Anyways, thanks in advance.",20Sep2019,1

Some of my fears are so far from reality I've found out when it was proven not true. But when I'm thinking about it I cant convince myself its not. It's just gotten worse that I'm not as depressed as I was to be. It's easier when I tell myself that theres nothing to fear because suicide is always an option. But I dont want to die right now so everything is just to terrifying with no way out of it, which also scares me of course. I cant sleep cause I'm anticipating something happening to me and everyone I care about. Theres so much that can happen its bound to happen any second if it hasn't already. Theres just nowhere to go I cant hide from it even by sleeping because I feel like I need to be constantly aware of everything going on around me. What do I even do when I'm paralyzed with fear.

66,"So as the title suggests I struggle badly with depression and a feeling of emptiness. In that I feel like everyone else has something to be proud of and focus on, ie a good career, relationships, a hobby or passion. 

I feel like I don't have any of this, I'm trying to work on my career but it's a recent change and guess I may feel better in time but I don't have any form or relationship outside of friends, I dont have anyone I'm especially close to and my passion has slowly gone from my hobbies.

What keeps happening is i find something to latch onto, recently it was someone I had romantic interest in and would put all my attention and effort towards that for it not to go anywhere, she didn't feel the same. This happens with a lot in my life, recently had a burst of energy to try boxing again and loved it, had a charity boxing match and lost, not that it should really matter the result and now I have no energy to keep it up even though I enjoyed it massively and really helped.

The main feeling is that I get something or someone to put a lot of time and effort and energy in and then that seems to fall apart in my eyes, like I feel that I'm going through a period of latching onto the broken pieces and when I can't fix it destroying what I had built up.

76,"A friend and I had a crazy heart to heart where we just completely related on mindsets and emotions for hours on end. We mutually agreed that something was wrong with the way we thought, but honestly it’s so crazy from an outside view that neither of us thought anyone else could possibly think this way until we talked to each other about it. In fact, we’ve both tried explaining it to people close to us before only for it to completely horrify them...


I was mostly wondering who I should seek help from and how. I’ve never been to any form of therapist or psychiatrist (honestly don’t know what terminology is what) in my life. 


I don’t know enough about what I’m thinking to be able to even look up resources online for what it is and what type of professional I should go to for it, so this is the only place I could think of. 


As a general list of the things we talked about, completely open and uncensored (please don’t dox me on this, I know it’s fucked up and I’m trying to get over it)

-Staring the ceiling for hours at a time thinking about things that should spark emotion, but being completely emotionless and apathetic

-Thoughts about what it would be like to kill somebody. I don’t think I’d ever actually do it, but we talked about a specific and real narrative of his that I don’t feel comfortable sharing in which we both could see ourselves killing somebody. 

-When he told me the story I mentioned right before this point, my heart was racing and I started feeling emotional as he quickly approached the end result of the story, but when the end came I suddenly lost all emotion over the situation. This is fairly common for me. I’m not sure if it’s because it’s too much for my brain to handle so it shuts off or if it’s something else that’s just wrong with me. 

-Generally speaking, we understand people’s emotions and thoughts extremely well. Ever since I was a kid I could pretty easily talk people through their feelings even if they were feelings I’d never really felt yet. I’m not sure if I feel empathetic or just as rational as possible at these times (that’s not the best way to describe it but as close as I’ll get over text) but I typically don’t feel much. 

-We have situations where we will naturally act like a completely different person without noticing in the moment. By this, I kind of mean like we’ll think we’re being ourselves in the moment but looking back on the moment with hindsight it’s very obviously nothing like how we act and we generally don’t end up proud of the way we act in these times, regardless of the outcome. 

-We both have had experience depression. It’s something that bags around but was most prominent during our middle/high school years. In conjunction with this, we were both bullied as kids and fairly outcast.

-We tend to be really good at making many many acquaintances and are naturally extroverted publicly-facing, but in reality only have a select 2-3 people we can legitimately call friends at any given time. 

-Ever since I was young I was told by parents and teachers that I was good at writing things that projected my emotions, but often times things I wrote with emotion were fabricated things that I just made up. I’ve only ever once written my true emotions and it was in a foreign language (at least up until this post. This isn’t very emotionally charged per se, but it’s my true thoughts)

Honestly the list goes on and on, but I don’t know how much further is overkill. If anyone knows what category of psychologist I should go to for symptoms like these, I would really appreciate the info. I’d like to talk to a professional about what I’m feeling and potential steps to changing if needed.",20Sep2019,1
77,"I’m 18, graduated high school early because of my mental health. And have lost numerous jobs over the course of the year because of it as well. I take two medications, one for my ADHD and the other for my dopamine levels. It’s a Prozac antidepressant but I hate taking both of them as my family has a history with addiction and drugs and I would rather suffer mentally than suffer physically and mentally from withdrawal. Which is exactly what continues to happen to me.


I live in my fathers basement, it might sound depressing but I actually feel extremely comfortable down here. It’s a safe place where the things I enjoy are. I have two pet birds that I recently bought and am currently finger training them. My dad is a good guy and someone who’s company I enjoy, until as of recent.


So I’ve been out of my medication for awhile, I usually don’t take the ADHD med cause it’s a highly illegal street drug that you hear people going nuts for on the news and it just makes me uncomfortable to be prescribed it. I usually cave on my Prozac and take it because it makes me feel like a human. Well when I run out of the Prozac is usually when the waterfall starts up, because without it my mental illness symptoms begin to skyrocket. It takes about a month and a half for it to filter out, but my case is very very extreme. So it goes away within a few days and takes months to kick up again. 


I’ve called in to my new job the past couple of days and am probably fired, but I like to hold on to hope that maybe I’m not. Calling in is one of the hardest things for me to do, but there isn’t another person on the other line here so I can do it a bit easier.  I had a panic attack on Tuesday for the first time in a good couple of months, and called my dad and asked him to leave work early so I could have some comfort. I talked to him about everything and how I always feel terrified and depressed, and how I don’t understand it. He was supportive, but these past few days he hasn’t been. He doesn’t deal with these issues, and really no body understands in this household what it’s like to feel this internal stabbing at your heart all day everyday. 


He tells me I need to grow the fuck up and I can’t blame it on anyone but myself, which I know. I know I need to grow up, I know It’s my fault and no one else’s. But I don’t know what to do. It’s inevitable that it will happen again, and I feel like my parents would be better off if I just disappear. My mother kicked me out of the house around January because of my problems. Saying I’m just lazy and don’t care about anyone else. The problem is how much I care, if I didn’t fucking care I wouldn’t feel like this. But it’s impossible to explain to anyone. 


I have nothing I enjoy doing anymore. I wish I would just fade away but if I did end up offing myself or some shit I’m afraid of what will happen to my family. I’m afraid they would blame themselves for it and hate me for being weak. I’m trapped in a never ending cycle and I don’t know what to do...



If you read till the end thank you. Just needed to write this down somewhere...anywhere really. I have all these things I wanna do with my life, but all these things in my mind holding me back and all these insecurities holding me down. I wanted to be a teacher, or a police officer, or a veterinarian because I love animals. But I can’t even go to Walmart without having a panic attack.",20Sep2019,4
78,"Ok, so I've been diagnosed with chronic depression and BPD (I doubt the latter though). The past few weeks though I've had what could be considered symptoms of hypomania/a mixed episode. Those don't really affect me negatively, rather in the contrary.  I don't really see a reason why I would talk to my doctor about this except for if these are early signs of a bipolar disorder with full-on mania etc.. I've also kinda been quite paranoid, e.g. I have short periods of time where I believe people know what I'm thinking which leads to me not being able to concentrate, get panicked etc, it goes away after about ten minutes though. I'm thinking though that everyone gets that sometimes, I only mentioned it because it's so intense when it happens. I know I could just talk to my doctor about this but I don't wanna make a fuss about something that's not that serious (yet?). What do you guys think?",20Sep2019,1
79,"Stop putting off selfcare. If you are like me you probably think you don't deserve it, you can't handle it, it isn't worth it, dying is easier, etc. Stop now. Get out of bed and do something. Anything. Clean your room. Even if it's just one used plate at a time of picking up one piece of worn clothing from the floor. 

You deserve to get better, you really do. And you will be so happy for yourself. Every little achievement might give you enough energy to reach another one! I know everything seems overwhelming and you have no idea where to start. But the beautiful thing is that you can start literally anywhere and there is no right or wrong. 

A couple weeks ago debt collection knocked at my parents' door. They blew my whole cover, made my parents realize that I (22m) am in $5.8k of tax debt from a job I no longer have.  This was a wake-up call because it had to be. I decided I can't put this burden on my family. I don't mind being a fuck up for myself but I want to be good for my parents. So I started going to debt counselling and getting some help. This didn't help the depression though. 

I was drinking way too much (for any occasion really, but certainly also because I was sad) and ended up in bed with my roommate. This fucked my brain for two weeks and I wasn't doing great but then I forced myself to ask her out. I got shot down but I re-learned that falling on my face is not that bad. It made me want to seem desirable again. So now I quit alcohol and weed (5 days sober!) and I'll go to my first sports class in years on Wednesday. I'm still lazy and in debt and still have suicidal thoughts. I still feel overwhelmed when I think of everything I need to fix about my broken ass. But at least there's moments of hope and I feel like I can actually get better. I'm moving back to my parents' house for a couple months to save rent and to get some peace of mind, life in the city is so fast. 

I guess all I want to say is take care of yourself. You've only got yourself so make the best of what you have. Don't put pressure on yourself because everyone fails and everyone can feel like they can't handle a single thing about life. Don't be afraid to take a step back. Don't be afraid to admit to your issues and talk about them openly because THEY DO NOT DEFINE YOU! Don't LET them define you. Refuse to give up. You can do it. Baby steps is all it takes. Get support wherever you can - don't worry about people leaving you because if they will then they don't deserve you in the first place. Your body and mind deserves to be taken care of. Allow your mind time to rest and not think about all the shitty things about life. They are only a part of it and they are not your whole life, even if it feels like this. 

No matter how bad you feel I know that somewhere within you there's a little part of you that wants to get better. Maybe even a large part. So follow this instinct. Because out of all the thoughts your depression/anxiety/etc. is making you have, this is the only important one. So stop pushing it away. Don't put off selfcare. The time is now!

80,"Since I was a kid I would often find myself at least once a day doing what I thought was zoning out. It's almost like my brain would shut down entirely, I wouldn't just feel like I was somewhere else, I would fixate on an object with my eyes and completely stop thinking. Sometimes I would sit like that for a minute straight, sometimes even longer. Perfectly still, without a single thought in my head, and sometimes depending on the severity my eyes would go out of focus. I mean literally go out of focus. The same way I imagine your eyes do when you close your eyes and you aren't actually staring at your eyelids. Everything would be blurry and completely out of focus.

I'm an adult now and I still have this occasionally, more like a few times a week as opposed to everyday like I did when I was a kid. When I get like this, I can hear if people are speaking to me but I can't physically respond until I find a way to pull myself out of it. Sometimes it takes a while. A few weeks ago it happened while I was trying to pick up some heavy items, my mother was asking me if I could carry it all and while I was trying to figure out how to manage it, my brain shut down. I stood there entirely still and my mom called my name a few times. When I finally came out of it she asked me if I was alright because I stood motionless and unblinking for a solid forty seconds.

83,"I noticed something chilling in regards to my memory loss. If I trace it back, it seems to have originated from the absolute worst day of my life. I *would* go into it, but it's so painful I can't even tell the story without crying my eyes out. 


I am going to be twenty next year. Despite how young I am, my memory is abysmal. Short-term, I forget every little fucking thing I set my mind to, every single day. It's gotten to a point where I feel like I shouldn't be driving, that I shouldn't be cooking, and thst I shouldn't be trusted with any small task. I forget EVERYTHING. The second something enters my brain, it's gone forever. What confuses me is that it wasn't always like this. It's not like I've been huffing gasoline or suffered literal brain damage. 

I kept thinking about it, though... When I was sixteen, I went through an event akin to a live-autopsy, metaphorically speaking. That day has haunted me endlessly. The humiliation, defilement, and trauma, was brutal. I want to cut my chest open anytime the memory seeps back into my psyche. This day imprisoned me in my own head, but it was more of a torture chamber. I was tortured by this day. 


It got so physically, emotionally, and mentally unbearable, that I began a process of breaking my mind down. I'd brainwash myself for hours on end, condition myself, into believing that day just never happened. I'd hide in the recesses of my brain and spew a mantra at myself: *It never happened. You're crazy and you made it up. It's okay. It was all fake.* I told this to myself whenever it'd pop up to torment me. I don't think it ever worked, it just seemed like the only option for relief. 


Ever since this one horrific day, I feel like my memory's been on a rapid spiral downward. I've forced myself to forget everything unjust that's happened to me, now it's all my brain does. Forget stuff.  


I wanted to ask if any of you think these things could be correlated. I was quite sharp as a young teen. Forgetfulness was not hampering my life like it is now. I feel like I forcefully reworked my brain to be shittier, but I could be wrong. Maybe it's just a freak case of Alzheimer's.

90,"so even from the time that my mother concived me i have always just born surround with drama.

when my mother got pregnant with me my mother went through sever complications. she was only 17 at that time but for some reason the pergancy was critically complicated. i havent talked much to her about it so dont know what exactly it was all about but all i do know form all the talk that i have heard of the story about my birth is that all doctors had raised their hands and given up on me surving the pergancy.

but yet at the end of day here i was perfectly normal and healthy as a normal newborn could be.

But unfortunately my parnets were not happily married. and my mother never wanted me. and all of her pregnacies ever were severly complicated and she never manged to give birth to any other child except me.

but then also bc of my parents unhappily marriage my father was an absentee dispite being marride the whole time and all of my childhood was basically an excpericnace of being raised by a narcissist- my mother.

but honstly i did not have much to complain about bc i was a very naive child and most of my childhood i never really quite took any notice of how narcissistic my mother really was up untill around the time that i became a teenager.

other wise in my whole family there was only one person who was truely an un maliced gem and she was my grandmother. but unfortunatel she died from breast cancer when i was in 5th grade around just about in her 50's only. and till today (i am 34 yrs old) to me it feels like a loss i will never recover from.

when i went to high school there was this one guy who had a crush on me but he was a bully and i spent all of my high school getting bullied by him.

then right from around the time i was in high school my mother had already kept in mind a guy that she wanted to marry me to started talk about marrying me. and the whole time i was so naive i didnt even know that all i had to say was just no to my family to get out of it. and by the time i was 22 they put so much pressure on me about it that agreed to the marriage and got married to him. despite that i never really wanted to simply bc i did not know that all i had to do was just say no.

anyway aftet i got married things in my life escalated over night. suddenly it was like everyone i ever knew right in my own family and closest to me was just out to digg at my marriage and fuck it up for me and they werent even being sneaky about it and doing it behind my back. it was all happening in my face and infront of me. and this even included my own mother.

and obvious to me i thought that if this is how things were going to be already then i didnt need to put up with the marriage and 5 month in a walked out of it.

after i walked out my mother started with this branding and labeling me as mentally ill. and i tried talking to my father a couple of times but he just became a yes man to me in my face and a yes man to everyone else that apposed me in their face and he was not making it a seceret either.

i was litrally being forced to see concellors and take threapy form what every tom dick and harry councelor that anyone ever told them.

to the point that this one concellor i saw was a retired person but was considered to be the best psycologist of all of history and took up the request to councle me only specifiaclly as a personl favour through the request of some social connections that my parents had. but thats not all of it.

i went to see this person at his house and through out the session my mother was peresent in the room with us the whole time which other thrapists never did. and then at one point this guy was just rambeling on about some unfairness my actions were causing my mother. which was absoulte to the peeks of mounteverst and beyond total bull. my mother was literally doing drama to the point of fake crying to make the this guy take her side instead of mine and this was all happening with the both of them obvioulsy in chime with each other. and since i was obviously being falsely cornered by them i shut down and stopped interacting and just went silent. and then the next thing is what is really the part caught me off gaurd. and this bloody retired old hag of a therapist started yelling at me. litterally cowering over the top of my head and yelling at me at the fucking top of his lungs that i was the one at fault for everything whatever that their conversation was all about.

i had never thought that a shrink was even capable of such a thing. and regardless i never went back to see him. but i never had anyone to talk to about any of this ever the whole. bc it was like everyone i every knew my whole life had turned on me.

a year later things between me and all my family got so bad that one day my father who had never even had any role in my whole life got to the point of physically abusing me one night.

after that i told them that i was an adult and that i did not need to live with them any more and that i wanted to move out. at this my father put down his foot and he's like you cannot move out unless you move out of the country. i am not allowing you to move out anywhere inside this country.

and i had never wanted to go abroad ever but at this point i even took this chance and went to study in canada for a 2 and 1/2 year course.

but then things took an even worser turn at this point. and this is the part which is the main bit for which i am wrting this whole post. and it is really a very weird part that is hard to make any sense of what so ever at all.

but the first day i went to college this one guy stuck his head out at me and smiled at me as a friendly guesture to warm me up to him. but when i turned and looked in his direction all i could see and think of the guy that bullyed me in high school.

and i could not even reach out and make friends with a single person in college and ended up being a recluse the whole time. and on top of everything the thoughts about the guy that bullied me in high school just opened like flood gates after that day in college and just would not stop and go way.

all this happened in September 2009. and this is September 2019. and it has been exactly 10 yrs now since then and they still have not stopped. i have no idea why i get them ldk if it is some kind of ptsd

but it doesn't even end there. and this the reall ugly part of it all. and i could sewar by it that these thoughts feel like they are being imposed on me from the outside bc there is no way in the world that i could have ever thought of anything like it on my own ever.

but it was like i was hearing voices in my head that were constanly nagging  me and forcing me that i was in love with him and that i wanted to marry him and that i should contact him and tell him all of this.

up till winter break i ignore all of it. in winter break i unfortunately went back home and was jusy out with my faimly at a mall one day. and i even ended up runing into this guy at that mall.

but we only saw each other from a distance in a fleeting glance from the corner of the eyes and not eye to eye. and that was it.

after winter break i came back to canada and my thought/voices in the head/ delusions what ever you could call them still would not stop and go away to a point that in february i looked him up on facebook and found his profile on it. and it turned out that he was already engaged to this one chick from school.

and my thoughts now advanced to the point of trying to compell me to the point of making him break up his engaement. and not one of it felt like it was me myslef that wanted to do any of it personally. it was all just like i was being forced to do it by someone that had somehow found a way to driect me directly through speaking with thoughts in my brain.

but one day in february i mesaged him on facebook and he was out on a dinner date with his fiance. and i just dropped a hello. and this guy is literally like are you suddenly interested in me now bc i have money now. and started accusing me of being a gold digger. and instantly we ended up in an spat with each other which he then went on and even told his fiance about who immidately took the phone from him and got into a spat of her own with me. and it just got cut short at that and that was the end of it. and we never contacted each other again.

fast forwading i could not end up finishing my cource in Canada and came back home after 2 yrs. and after a year or less my parents seperated.  not divoreced. they are still currently not divorced but my dad tells me that my mother told him that she is already in a relationship with a married man named Harry but still will not divorce him bc assume she still intendes to take a dig at my inhertance from my father at the drop of any opportunity that arisies.

but anyway at this point after my parents seperated it became clear to me why my mother had started off with the lable of calling me mentally ill. it was all because she was looking for an out of the marriage the whole time. and apparently claiming that me and my fathers whole side were menatlly unstable was a way for her to give valid socially acceptable reason for why she could not put up with us anymore and leave.

and once this happend it finally became clear to me why she did all the things she did. 

and then at this point i was like okay now that this label that they branded me with has served it puropse i guess i have no more reason to worry about anything anymore and things should start getting normal now.

instead the labeling and branding would still not stop. and i started to get into even bigger spats with both sides of my family to a point that they started to institutionalise me into rehabs. first it was my aunt from my mother side that put me away for 2 moths.

after that i moved to my fathers side. and started living with an aunt from my fathers side and 4 yrs passed by without drama for the first time since 2008. and everything despite that my delutions were still present things started to look good again.

and at this point in time i started to tackle the problem of these delusions that whould still not stop. and i thought maybe one of the ways i can takle it is if maybe i try to meet new guys with whome i can have a more positive experance with and maybe it might help. and hoestly it really did not to me seem like it was ever going to be possible but then tinder was the new buzz in town and i downladed it and just genrally started to just chat online. and in 2016 i met these 3 guys out of which who was such a sweet heart when we first met that after about a year of chatting with him online i actually stopped thinking about the the hight school bully almost completely.

but i didnt connect with any one of them good enough to completely get out of it. but chatting with them was genuinly the one of the best part of my life after a very long time and very welcome relife. but i lost touch with all of the guys after 2018 and my tinder account got banned permanently and it is not a reversable ban.

i tried downlading other apps but none of them have crowds like there where on tinder in 2016. and none of the guys on them make me feel like much.

but then anyway in 2018 even my aunt who had been putting up with perfectly fine all of the last 4yrs suddely like just beacuse she could. at this point its like everyone and every one i know has just made it a right of passage to step on me and get past to proove god knows what and get god knows what medals. its like quiflying a level for everyone around me at this point to get to the next thing in life.

all over a fucking cat. aftet i lost touch with all the guys i thought maybe i should try getting a pet and i could be like a pet thrapy. bc i dont fucking want anything to do with actual shrinks ever

but my aunt tossed me out of the house all of a sudden after 2 months of having the cat in her house suddely say she did not want it.

and my father chucked me into rehab for 3 months last year just beacuse he could.

after that suddenly everything became a lot better in my life suddenly again. my father started being really nice to me all of a sudden. money wise he had never riesteicted me this whe time up till now still. but this time he even renovated one of our houses and gave me the keys to live in to all by my self and bought me my first car last year in december.

adn i was literally like is it for real. excpet my deluitions and thoughts and all of that stuffabout the bully just keeps getting worse and worse in my mind. and i still dont know how to fix them. like dont get me wrong they are still not as bad since 2016 but in a way at the same time still acting up even more than ever. like somedays i literally question my sanity bad.",20Sep2019,2

94," I was locked up in a maximum security prison In melbourne for a violent crime. I was a violent offender and it wasn't my first sentence.  Inside prison I attacked other inmates and sometimes even the guards. I was part of a prison gang as well. I started working with a psychologist,  and slowly but surely she changed my way of thinking,  and eventually I developed feelings towards her, and I felt those feelings being returned. I started writing her poems and eventually the relationship became romantic.  

It was hard for her as she said a relationship of this sort was strictly forbidden and if we were caught her career would be over. Yet she still came to see me and I still gave her my poetry, the contents getting more riske the more our connection grew. I could see the stress in her eyes wen we would meet, I would try and reassure her everything will be fine, we wont get caught, she also mentioned that by law we could be together after 2 years, I told her I could wait for her. 

Anyway the officers searched my cell one day and found some poems I had addressed to her, we were already under investigation as her constant visits had been noted by the officers. Least to say I was distraught, we weren't allowed to see each other anymore. I told the officers that the poems were stupid and that she hadn't seen them before, even though she had. It's hard to paint this picture but imagine being in prison, in a cell 22 hours a day, not being able to see the girl I wanted to spend the rest of my life with (I told her that as well) everything was out of my control,  I thought her career was going to be over, and it was all my fault,  i would lie on my cold cell floor, unable to move, crying hysterically,  guilt ridden. The officers would tell me nothing,  so the next 2 months was literally hell on earth mentally, stuck in a cage wondering how she's doing.  I found out then that she was not fired, there wasn't enough evidence supporting our relationship,  I was so happy for her, I thought this is great news. I then heard she was leaving the prison anyway, there was no way for us to contact each other, so I didn't even get to say goodbye.  

The next 2 years was the hardest 2 years of my life. I missed her so much, she was my first love, I didn't want to be a criminal anymore because of her. I had never had suicidal thoughts, but now I wanted to kill myself, I would tie up bedsheets and tie them around my neck at night, trying to work up the courage to end my life, I couldn't.

It got to the point where I stopped talking to anyone,  I would stay in my cell, I developed severe anxiety, sometimes I wouldn't even get dinner because I was too anxious to stand in line. I was a broken man. I spoke to another psychologist who sort of knew the situation,  tho she only knew the story as the prison knew it, there were allegations made but nothing proven. I was in desperate need of help, I was losing my mind, we started talking but it was hard because I couldn't reveal why I was so fucked up and suicidal. Eventually I let slip about what the real relationship was between me and nicole, not her real name. The psychologist heard, then told me to be careful what I say, meaning she would have to say something to her superiors. I didn't know at the time but they were actually close friends. 

So here I am now with depression and anxiety,  the likes of which I didn't know existed, not wanting to live anymore , no peace and quiet,  there's no silence in a unit with 100 guys, no one to talk too, my cell was my sanctuary and..well…my prison. The only thing that kept me going was getting out and contacting nicole, through fb. So I got out of prison, after serving 4 and a bit years, I was also deported back to nz, my country of birth. I saw my family, but sadly I wasn't as happy to see them as they were me. I was still depressed and suicidal,  I needed to talk to nicole. Finally i got through to her, i had waited 2 almost 2 years for this, 2 years of thinking about her everyday, of all the moments we shared, 2 years of guilt, I still felt awful about what had happened,  it was all my fault.

All she said to me was she couldn't discuss anything about what had happened, and she wished me all the best. I kept messaging and she told me it was inappropriate, stop messaging me. That was it.

I then learned that she had a boyfriend the whole time. And they were still together.  From the time I had given her poetry, and she told me no one had ever made her feel that way , she was in a serious relationship. I was a wreck. Living in a small shack which I shared with a family member, no privacy, completely heart broken. Not used to the outside world. 

I dont know how to feel, everytime I think of her a knife pierces my chest, I miss her. I still feel that everything is my fault. I just can't seem to get over it, wen I think back to prison, it fuckin destroyed me, thinking about her everyday in my cell, it was the only thing that brought a smile to my face, then to be released from prison to find out the whole time I was thinking of her, she was in another mans arms. Soul destroying. Last I heard she's still a psychologist,  she going for her PhD, and she works for the police now lol (when I saw that, I felt even more used) 😞",20Sep2019,5

96,"I'll try to keep this as brief as possible.  
Me (22m) and my girlfriend (22) have been in a relationship for over half a year now, I'd say around 3/4th of a year. I knew from the start that she was struggling with depression and anxiety so it did not come as a surprise to me. I'd rather not share more precise locations but I live in the Netherlands and she lives in Romania. Important note: Both of us come from some pretty scarring abusive relationships, but we discuss this a lot together and we're open about it.

She has her ups and downs, her biggest ups as far as I known have been when we've physically been together. I visited her around March this year for the first time, and our relationship has been even better since then, this june me and a friend visited her place for a week and after that she came home with me and stayed there for over a month. Everything went well during that time, of course sometimes she had depressive episodes and sometimes for example if I wasn't up for sex she'd get upset thinking that she wasn't attractive enough and things like that (I'm guessing that's part of her anxiety). Of course this is far from the truth and I find her incredibly attractive but I understand that it's very difficult to convince her that it's not her fault, especially since she got blamed for pretty much everything in previous relationships.

So it's all nice and well but ever since she got back to Romania things have been going very downhill. Depressive episodes come way less frequent than I've ever witnessed and arguments arise between us fairly regularly. She misreads a lot of things that I do and say. For example if she would send me a picture of herself and I respond in a way that doesn't exactly match her expectations she will get incredibly anxious and depressed and this occasionally sparks arguments.

She has a tendency whenever we have a serious discussion to get really emotional, making it hard to find a solution to whatever problem we're facing and if I'm being completely honest, I'm not a flawless person either and I sometimes get upset/angry at her knowing fully well that she can't help feeling the way she does. The arguments are just very frequent these days and it's difficult for me too so I can't always control my emotions either. When this happens of course we do talk it out afterwards but I feel like her situation is really spiraling downwards lately and I'm very worried about her.

&amp;#x200B;

Now comes the biggest problem. Naturally we've had people tell us that she needs to get professional help, but not only is good help hard to find in Romania, it's also expensive and she has no income, and the health insurance doesn't cover it at all. I really want to help her, I care ***so much*** about her and breaking up is just not an option for me. I'll support her even through whatever she needs but I need help. I could really use some tips or advice on how to handle this situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm saving up for an apartment so that she can live here and when she does she'll be able to get professional help, but Romania is very depressing for her and it causes her mental health to spiral down quickly so I need help to keep her head above water until she moves to the Netherlands.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope for both her sake and mine somewhere here might be of some help and if not any emotional support/encouragement is also welcome.",20Sep2019,2

103,"I don’t know what I want to do anymore, I feel as though I’ve always had a fluctuating form of depression. Recently I’ve been feeling happy and normal but today I’ve gone straight back down to a point where I don’t even know whether my life is worth living or not. 
I don’t really know what to do anymore, I don’t want to die but I don’t wasn’t to live anymore. I don’t want to live in fear that I’m wrong or I’m annoying someone cause that’s all I seem to be doing right now. I just really don’t know anymore",20Sep2019,3
104,"I want to preface this by saying, for 5 years (8th-12th grade) I had no anxiety. It was not a part of my life. I never ruminated on things and my panic attacks had stopped in 7th grade when I got over my social anxiety.
I was incredibly social, would go to parties two or three times a week and go anywhere with my friends at any time of the day.
I used to be able to sit in my room alone and enjoy myself and watch long videos.
People love me, I’m outgoing, I have many friends and my dad says im “confident, radiant, and a little crazy”

This past month, the anxiety came back to me. For no reason. Its not social anxiety anymore, its generalized anxiety. I get panic attacks playing the sims alone in my own house.
That exact thing happened. I was in create a sim finishing up a sim, and suddenly dread washed over me. My chest felt like it was caving in, and my stomach got very very upset. I suspect I have emetophobia as well, because I spend a lot of the day focusing on my stomach making sure I dont have to throw up. And since im focusing so much on it, it eventually feels wrong and im convinced I’m about to vomit— and a panic attack sets in.
So I get up, I’m dizzy and sweating at this point. I sit next to the toilet and hang my head over it for about a minute. Nothing happens as far as puking, but my physical symptoms continue to worsen. I stand up to go find my parents and my ears start ringing LOUD. It feels like there is glue in my ears and the only thing I can hear is ringing. I get terrible tunnel vision right as I enter the hallway, and I’m virtually blind. I run into the wall because I can’t see, I can’t hear, Im dizzy and my chest feels like an elephant is sitting on it. I feel like im on fire and I can smell the sweat. At this point I lay down on the ground face-up, starfish style, convinced I’m having a heart attack and dying and going crazy. I’m screaming for my parents and can barely hear my own voice, It sounds robotic and incredibly muffled and I’m still virtually blind, I can’t breathe, my whole body is on fire....
It took about five minutes to pass. My dad felt my skin and said it was red and extremely hot. I’m exhausted coming down from my panic. I can hear again and I can see again.

Why is this happening to me? I havn’t left my house in a week. I skipped school and bailed on an appointment with a college advisor. I feel like I’m trapped. I havn’t answered any calls or texts from my friends. I don’t want them to see me like this. They’re used to me being crazy, loud, fun and carefree. CAREFREE. I feel like overnight my life flipped 180. I’m scared, timid, weak, helpless, constantly sweating and shaking and feeling like I desperately need to puke. The things I did just a month ago— parties, late night adventures, meeting strangers, laughing, being overly confident. I miss me so much. What happened to me????? 
I’m isolating myself more and more and I fear that I’m going to become agorophobic. My mind is constantly racing. The worst thing is that nothing triggers the panic or anxiety. Theres nothing I can cut out of my life to avoid it. It’s always here. I’m sick of it and am ready to go to the hospital if my psychiatrist refuses to perscribe me benzos when I see him Monday. I need medicine that works IMMEDIATELY. I can’t wait a month for medicine to start working. I will be in the hospital if this doesn’t get better in a week. 
I feel like I’m going crazy, slipping into psychosis, dying.....
I just want my life back. I miss being impulsive, stupid, carefree. I would trade anything back for my old life. I’m at the end of my rope after only one month of this. I can’t take much more. I feel completely disabled, crippled, exhausted and vulnerable.
I miss being crazy and partying and smoking and drinking. What happened to me? I feel so alone and every day is a constant battle against this anxiety. Please tell me I’m not alone, because I feel so so so very alone. I’m isolated. I’m miserable.",20Sep2019,2

106,"So last time i had my therapy session, my therapist told me he's diagnosed with bipolar as well, we even have the same anti-depressants and he sees his own therapist for his case. Since then I got a bit uncomfortable thinking about it because I keep recalling what I've said during sessions because that included a lot of complaining about having the unstable moods aka bipolar and other disorders, somehow i felt i'm being offensive without knowing, although at the same time i know he understands because he's a psychiatrist himself and he knows this stuff. It's not really because i think he's too unstable or something to be treating a patient with the same diagnosis, but because now i feel like we're more alike and that his advices or ""counseling"" now equals to just a normal friend or peer, not from an expert on psychiatry and mental health, even though that's clearly not true. I even think about what if I trigger him with something I say. 

He's honestly been a great psychiatrist, helped me through a lot, and i haven't seen him again yet since I found out because our next appointment's not til next month. I just don't know what to do now because I already know I'll be feeling awkward the next session and will most like be holding in more of my thoughts and things to say, unlike how I've always been because I've always been so open to him.

Hot Take: r/wowthanksimcured is a community that (from my view on the outside) encourages a belief that user-active solutions to mental health concerns are unfeasible or just plain don’t work.  

To clarify: sun and exercise *are not* cure-all panacea, but they *do produce a measurable positive result*.  

As someone who has struggled through some pretty fucking black depression/anxiety with frequent panic attacks and wild and unruly emotions that left me non-functional for many years (and do please ask if you are curious), I know that the only reason I am where I am today is through *my hard work*. I’ve spent weeks in a mental institution, I’ve taken a dozen or more different psychiatric medications, I’ve had psychiatrists and psychologists that only seemed to make my symptoms worse. I clawed my way out of that by trying really, *really* hard to fight back against the patterns of behavior and thought that I found myself trapped in. And I’ve learned a hell of a lot on the way.  

So the proposal is this, for anybody interested, create a subreddit and community that supports those actively trying to better there situation. Support including actionable advice, stories of solidarity, solutions that work, and those that don’t. It would need some good ground rules, and good quality moderation (something I’m excited for, but have zero experience with).

What do you think? Good idea? Shit idea? Want to help out? Share your stories of what works for you?

I’ve realized that my brother and sister were primarily gone. 

My sister stayed with her friends 40 minutes away.  
I have no idea where my brother was staying.

I cannot remember at all where I was.   
I don’t remember anything form it.  
I remember when they moved out into their pink house.  
I cannot remember anything from my life during the time they were there though.

114,"Hello,

I started taking Sertraline (50mg) about one month ago and so far it has made me feel really strange (in a bad way) so I was looking for some advice. At first it helped and I felt good, but then after that (probably for the past two weeks) I have just felt really sort of numb, tired and apathetic towards everything. I dont really care about much anymore and it's a struggle to feel anything and keep my eyes open throughout the day. I can't concentrate on much and socialising or having conversations is really hard, I just cant process what the other person is saying fast enough to come up with a coherent answer.

I am also taking CBD oil and Bach flower remedies (dont think they have any effect with Sertraline) but am considering stopping them because of this, just to sort of see what is causing it.

I have been on both Sertraline and Citalopram in the past, with neither working well for me. Me and the GP decided to try Sertraline again because we thought that perhaps my expectations were too high the first time, but this time around I feel so much worse on it.

 Has anyone experienced this and does anyone have any advice?

Thanks

115,"I'm planning to post this for my 143 friends to see on FB but I don't know if it's a good idea. Thoughts?

---

tl:dr Ramblings on general and my mental health, mental illness, and addictions.

---

The stigma associated with mental illness and addictions needs to be challenged, and I feel that it is vital that we fight for the collective individuals, including their supports, who are affected by mental illness.


It is unfortunate that it is so easy to post on social media that you are ""heading to the gym, it's leg day"" but I would be extremely terrified to share ""heading to the clinic, it's brain day"". 


I am at the age or point in my life where I am extremely upset with the stigma surrounding mental health and addictions. I assume I currently present myself as a somewhat high functioning individual who you wouldn't think has or has had obsessive-compulsive tendencies, cutting and self-harming behaviours, major depressive disorder, seasonal depressive disorder, suicide attempts and ideation leading to hospital stays/visits, generalized anxiety disorder, ruminating thoughts and insomnia, an eating disorder, addictions and borderline personality disorder. Maybe I am misdiagnosed by the various psychiatrists I have seen in my area with various opinions, and this is cumulatively something more and that I actually in fact am an alien.


Love is powerful. After my father passed away a decade ago, I was firm in not loving anyone else other than my mom and brother. I decided to distance myself from others and as cheesy as it sounds, ""never love again"". The more people that get close, the more pain I will have to endure. Today, I am able to recognize all the people I love and hope that I can find the courage to verbalize this to them if I haven't. 


Other than my medical health professionals, and probably my partner, I have not been able to FULLY disclose my mental health experiences with my mother, brother, relatives, close friends, past partners, co-workers, managers, etc. for fear or embarrassment of how I will be perceived and the negative impact this information will have on my life. Even though I am feeling comfortable today to share this somewhat privately with my Facebook friends, I still have fear of others or the public knowing this information if it were associated with my name. It shouldn't have to be this way. This is why people die from suicide. And is the general public aware that individuals DIE from suicide and don't COMMIT suicide? Communicating that someone ""committed"" suicide is stigmatizing and insensitive. These words place blame on the individual and associates their suicide with committing a crime or committing a sin. They are not the ones to blame - we are. We as a society are at fault. Thankfully there are compassionate and good people in this world who care and are agents for social change.


We all need to take care of our mental health, but not everyone experiences mental illness, similar to not everyone experiencing respiratory illness. We don't know what anyone is going through and effort needs to be made in not making assumptions. Be kind to everyone. I know that this is a work in progress for myself as I am cognizant of my past behaviours and ongoing behaviours that aren't kind. 


I will not write more about how difficult it must be for someone to support another person experiencing mental illness. I cannot fathom what this must feel like for them. I think about my partner and how GRATEFUL I am to have him. I acknowledge that it may be the most difficult obstacle in his life, with not knowing which days, hours, minutes, or seconds things will change and I will be unpredictable. I thank all 143 of you Facebook friends for the impact you have had on my life, and you have had an impact on it whether big or small. Please be kind, spread the love, and pass it on. 


The End.


Afterword


My partner told me not to post this without having a long needed sleep and after seeing my medical professional to address my mental and physical illnesses today. Maybe he is right in that I will regret 'airing' out my life to you since we may have not physically met, only met once, or you secretly hate me; that's my mental illness talking. I look back on actions that I have identified as regrets (and there have been thousands of them mind you), but now I only have one regret in life. My one regret in life is not spending more time with my father before he died.


The truth is I haven't slept since 32 hours ago due to many physical and mental reasons and my mind is going everywhere. What am I even writing? What is this? I guess I'll head to the clinic, it's brain day.

119,"A lifelong friend of mine has started exhibiting pretty strange behavior. For years we've always shared the same absurdist sense of humor and would have each other in tears laughing at random, nonsensical things we would say. We've grown apart a bit with them living in NYC and I in DC, so the majority of my concern stems from their unusual activity on social media. They've become increasingly invested in politics, and flood their Twitter timeline and Instagram stories with screenshots of news articles about shootings, natural disasters, and other things that I think are fairly reasonable for a person to worry about. But they're unemployed, and AFAIK much more anti-social than the social butterfly I always knew them to be. 

Nothing seemed too out of the ordinary the last few times we hung out in person, except for the fact that we would be walking down the street talking about whatever and I'd find myself realizing I have no clue what they're talking about. I've shared screenshots of tweets and anecdotes about interactions I've had with them with another close mutual friend and they agreed that something seems off, even mentioning that (to them) their behavior seemed schizophrenic. I've suggested they see a therapist but they have no interest in doing so, and I don't know how to suggest to them they should seek out some kind of help without making them think I'm saying ""you're acting fucking crazy,"" which, having known them since kindergarten, is how I fear they would read it. 

Another close friend of his that lives in New York also recently reached out to me expressing concern, but we're both having difficulty figuring out how to address it without making them feel even more paranoid than they already seem to be.

125,"This is more of a vent piece if anything. Apologies if the wording seems weird, english isn't my first language and I will be directly translating certain medical words. 

For some context, right before summer started I got into a kind of a slump mental health wise, but I didn't pay much attention to it, figured it was only stress with graduation coming up and all that entails. Then come graduation, I get into one of the worst moods while still living at home. Grumpy all the time, tired, just wanting to be left alone. So finally, I start realizing this might be something else. Thus begun a depressive episode which I am yet to shake.

My plan was to take a year off before going to uni, but being stuck in my old city, still living at home with only a temp-job which frankly isn't going to provide much economic safety, it left me feeling like I was going nowhere. I felt like I was all alone in the world, with nothing to live for. No passions, no dreams, nothing. 

My first contact with professional help was with a therapist in my city. Only a few sessions in and she went on holiday. Great, right? I felt like this wasn't enough so I contacted my local care centre, explaining my symptoms, and the next week I had a time scheduled with a doctor. To make it short it was ""normal to be feeling down after graduation"". So I got no help there, except for a prescription for anxiety medication.

I did apply for university, just in case, and one day I got a mail that the applications had been answered. In less than a weekend I decided that, come end of summer, I was gonna move to a different city to study to become a teacher. Life was great for a while after that. I was excited for the move, excited to start my new life and get away from all the crap I'd been feeling before. But life doesn't work that way. When everything was unpacked I felt more alone than ever. 

This time I reached out to the youth psychiatric ward in the new city. They basically told me that since I wasn't disabled enough, seeing as I still got out of bed and did the shit I was supposed to do (because hey responsibilities), that they wouldn't offer me any care. They instead directed me to juvenile reception in my city, where I got the chance to meet with a therapist pretty quickly. As all things does, it seemed okay for a while. Until one major suicidal episode where I somehow managed to pull myself out of it and get myself to the emergency psych ward. 

At the emergency psych ward they told me that they could send in a referral to a care centre, where I could meet a doctor and get treatment. This, as sad as it sounds, made me really excited. I was finally going to get the help I obviously needed. A few weeks later I got a letter in the mailbox saying ""sorry, our wait for counselling is 2 months, we're going to refer you to the psych ward instead"". This knocked me down a few pegs, but I figured that since I was in the emergency ward they might take it more seriously this time around. Unfortunately for me, since I already had contact with a therapist at the juvenile reception they said that there was nothing they could do. So now I have to wait 2 months for my sessions to end before I *might* get a referral from my therapist  to the psychiatric ward. I'm not even sure I'm going to make it that long. 

So I beg of you, *where* am I supposed to get the help that I need?",20Sep2019,2

In middle school I was depressed, missed school a lot, and when I did go to school, I ate lunch In the bathroom. A teacher found me and screamed at me and suspended me and said I was “hiding”. I cried in her office and said ""None of the other kids like me"" and she replies :""well you should have said something"" or something along those lines.This was the worst time of my life .

I guess, I was in trouble because I wasn't where I was supposed to be?

I later did it again. She gave me a look of disgust and she forced me into the hell hole- to go to lunch. I hated her for that shit. How can she show no sympathy to a child? I was 12.

A few years later, I sent an email to her job saying she was mean and unprofessional . I sent her a message on Instagram calling her “ mean and ghetto “ and I later sent her a Facebook message calling her “ nasty and shouldn’t have her job” ( I never threatened her however ) . She told me she reported my Instagram message and I don’t think she read the Facebook message ever( it was in March) and that if I continue she will contact the police.

I feel like shit and I start therapy soon. I don’t want to go down the wrong path. i sent the Facebook message months ago but I messaged her yesterday saying I was hacked and didn’t mean to send it and I won’t contact her any more .I then deleted the fake Facebook account .

I get the sudden urge to scream, literally at the top of my lungs. Usually if I do it once, more occurrences will happen in succession. This started happening about 3 years ago. I used to be able to manage it well (Only screaming in my car or when I'm alone. Thankfully I live in the middle of nowhere.), but recently it has become very almost impossible to control, having to grit my teeth or bite down hard on my tongue. 

Secondly, I have started laughing after I scream, like a massive compelling force to laugh. I genuinely feel disconnected from my body when it happens. Like I am not inside of my body (I can't really explain it.)

When I put it in words it sounds crazy, but I genuinely didn't see it as a cause for concern up until recently. (I now have a job and I am around people a lot. As I am usually alone it wasn't so much of a problem, however having to control myself around people has exposed how much of a problem this is becoming.)

I was just wondering has anyone had anything similar to this, or can give me guidance? I have searched around the problem although many point to stress. However I live remarkably stress-free.

147,"My 16 year-old sister has been depressed for three years now with a history of self-harm. It was only this year that we finally convinced her to go to therapy, and she got diagnosed with mild clinical depression.

The thing is, she told me that she sugarcoated nearly everything during her intake session. And it was during summer break, so she was relatively stress-free. Basically her best state possible, and she was still diagnosed with mild depression.

She moved to a new school in a new city from a more rural town, and now one of her coping mechanisms is drinking out with friends every weekend.  She goes home at 3 am, and she makes everyone in the family worry about her whereabouts because she doesn’t respond to texts sometimes. Even after making her promise that she won’t drink again or go home late, she just keeps doing it.

Tonight, I witnessed her come home drunk. She told me that she threw up at one point while she was out. And then she proceeded to tell me how she feels no affection for anyone or anything, that even if our parents died in that moment, she wouldn’t feel anything. That she just wanted to die because she felt so empty inside, that nothing could ever make her feel better, not even therapy. After her first session she never came back because she kept cancelling schedules (using schoolwork as the main excuse). She told me that she could kill herself if she wanted to, she just didn’t want to because she believed in the possibility of hell and she was sure she would go there. 

And here’s what’s most alarming - she thinks she has psychopathic tendencies because of her lack of emotional attachmemt to anyone. Two days ago I also noticed that she had new self-harm scars after a year of not cutting.

Whenever I ask her why she feels depressed or suicidal, she says she doesn’t know. That there’s no particular reason. 

I’m trying to convince her to go back to therapy and give it try but she really thinks it won’t help. I have no idea what to do anymore at this point... it’s so hard seeing my sister like this and feeling unable to do anything. Please help :(",20Sep2019,1

149,"I don't even know where to start, I think childhood would be the most logical and as good a place as me. Both my parents were narcissistic people. They never loved me but only what I could give them. I don't blame them as circumstances are what made them who they are. But the only things that I learned as a child are

1. I am not good enough.
2. Everyone out there wants to use me.
3. It is ok for my parents to vent their frustration on me and use me as a punching bag.

This is not an exaggeration, I was neglected as a child and even though I am from a wealthy family I wear torn clothes and didn't develop the habbit of brushing my teeth!

This is the life I knew, I didn't know that things such as care and love actually existed. I thought its made up things that movies sell. The consequences of this in causal sequence are

1. I had developed an inferiority complex.
2. (I assume) This led to an inflated ego.
3. Delusions of grandeur.
4. Superiority complex; sometimes related to my looks and sometimes to my intelligence.
5. Always craving attention (which I thought I am entitled to)
6. I have no good habits whatsoever (none!)

I am an average looker and I assume someone with average intelligence but as you can imagine this led to constant bullying (which I deserved, considering my behaviour) and the vicious cycle kept fuelling itself.

My bubble burst when I reached college and fell for a girl. I thought its love ( it was only infatuation) and her rejection and berating made me realize one day that maybe I am at fault.

That proved to be quite a turning point as now I became the target of all my criticism. The fact that the pendulum swung so wildly in the other direction made me realise that I am not as intelligent as I thought.

I really tried improving myself but now I find myself as someone who no one wants to talk to. Everyone leaves me without exception, I can't blame them. Deep down I cant help but keep thinking of people as assets who are to be used in a project where I will eventually become a 'Human'.

Many good people have lost their time on me, they all leave me in disbelief and dejected. They are all happy away from me now.

At 30, I have nothing today in human terms. So I am planning to turn this thing around. I think I will try to work on my self. What should I do?",20Sep2019,1
150,"I’m going through the stages of acceptance of my loss and I’m trying to forgive myself but I genuinely believe from the bottom of my heart I did and said some immensely cold things out of nowhere. I’m realizing how emotionless and blunt I could be at random. 

I don’t know why my romantic feelings checked out randomly even though I still felt like I loved her. Now more than ever do I wish I never was so ignorant and cruel with my actions. One day I would be there fully for her and the next I wouldn’t even let her hold me when we went to sleep together. I can’t justify my flip flopping actions, we had been together for two years. 

Meanwhile I’ve been learning that I’ve had extreme anxiety for the last year and I’ve been traumatized by a mentally abusive family I stayed with that I lied to myself about, thinking it was normal. During that time until now I’ve felt really helpless and low on motivation and energy to go forward. The relationship helped me repress that but I can’t help but think all of these issues may have affected my capabilities of being intimate with her. Now that it’s over everything is resurfacing and becoming clear to me.

She always said I should go to therapy and I’m finally starting it next week. If anyone can help me understand my mental state and give me reassurance that there will be an end to this constant dread in my chest and thoughts it would really mean a lot to me. I want to fix myself",20Sep2019,1
151,"I've suffered from mental health problems my whole life. Over the last two years, I was diagnosed as bipolar type 2, following multiple diagnoses as major depressive with psychotic symptoms. As a result of hitting rock bottom, I finally received the treatment I needed and am on the mend, taking back my life.

About a year ago, I was in a terrible place. I had dropped out of school, had no job, couldn't get out of bed, and even when I did found myself paralyzed at the thought of leaving the house. One night, I felt I had two options: suicide or voluntary committal. So I made an agreement with myself: if I made it to the morning, I'd go to emerg.

It was around this time that my ex-reached out to me. We had been broken up for years, but had been together for 5 years, most of which we lived together. She said she had heard that I was not doing well, and told me I could confide in her. I was reluctant, since every conversation we had had over the prior year or so had turned into a massive argument. She insisted that she wouldn't argue, and that she was concerned for my well-being. So I opened up. I told her what I was contemplating, I told her that I was scared I might lose control, and that I was convinced the only thing stopping me from acting on tyne suicidal thoughts was the fact that I refused to leave my bed.

She asked me to vent, and so I did. Everything was fine until I said something that she understood to be about unresolved issues from our relationship, and everything took a sudden drastic turn. In an instant she went from listening, to telling me all my faults. I tried to end the conversation, clearly she was upset and it wasn't good for either of us to continue the conversation.

This is when she called me ""a toxic human being"".

To this day, I don't know how to begin to explain what I felt in that moment. It was misery and rage. It was sadness and despair. It was pain, and self-hatred for walking into such an obvious trap. It was like the last foothold had been kicked out from underneath me. I jumped back and forth from crying and laughing. Once again in my life, it was like I had let go of the steering wheel. I'm not entirely certain of my actions that night. I know I drank. I know I stole my roommates stash. I know I tried to obtain coke. But there's no flow of time to the memories. Just the noise of my depression screaming so loud in the back of my mind that nothing could drown it out.

When I woke up, I made good on my promise. I didn't end up being committed (Friday night in a big city psychward meant no beds). They gave me resources, offered to get me a room at a charity, provided me with medication, and some impromptu therapy that helped cobble together rationality. Long ago I made the agreement that if suicide is an option, than it can be argued for and that I would never consciously act without a valid argument. It helps me keep them in check. So I stayed until the noise of the waiting room became to much for me.

I survived. I always seem to. When in lucid, after all, I want to live by life.

Just over a month ago, my ex reached out to me. It might be good to note that prior to the aforementioned incident, our conversations always ended with her blaming me for every problem in her life, including things that predate our relationship, and things like the debt I had tried to help her pay off while we were together. She also accused me of cheating on her at 7am, the morning after we buried my father (she broke into my phone, and I absolutley had not cheated on her).

Anyways, she reached out and asked to talk. She said if I didn't reply, she would stop messaging me. I didn't reply. She continued. She wanted to apologize for everything. I framed the incident as ""you knowingly played chicken with my life"", and asked her if she could forgive someone of she were in such a situation. She said she understood. When I told her I didn't think I could trust the apology, things got interesting. She's getting married. She wants me at the wedding. I told her I'd think about it, but that I'd need time.

Writing it out, it's amazing how almost laughably narcissistic this all sounds... part of this was to get it off my chest, but I guess, for those who have read it all, could you forgive someone under these circumstances?

A close friend said that it might be healthy for me to forgive her to give my chance to be rid of the situation, but to tell her there's no reconciliation to be had, and that it's especially inappropriate for me to be at her wedding. I think he might be right, but I'm not sure if I'm capable of doing it.

I guess what I really need is help understanding how to move forward in a healthy manner. My life has been pieced back together, but I worry about how volatile I feel about the situation.",20Sep2019,1

154,"Originally posted to FB, immediately attacked by the gangstalkers, including the individual from the story who held me at gunpoint while I was having sex with his sister, quickly removed by FB, and then I was banned for 7 days. It's all legit:


So I've added a BUNCH of people, who MAY be connected to people who I know have been participating in an organized counter intelligence harassment program that has been targeting me with specific GASLIGHTING techniques, going so far as to infiltrate my personal life with fake intimate relationships, using multiple women to set me up for constant narcissistic emotional abuse, and also to constantly bring me into several different outrageous scenarios, which were clearly contrived to provoke reactions from me, ranging from simply making me uncomfortable, to being held at gunpoint while I was naked and in the middle of sex with Summer Ann Shadburn... which I'm pretty sure I handled better than most people would've!


Anyway, since those of you I added are mostly mutual friends with the group of people I know are involved in this program, I'm asking you all for some direction. What the hell am I supposed to do exactly?


The program utilizes convicts in prison or people facing potential prison sentences by offering early parole, or sweetheart plea deals in exchange for working in the program. Indeed, I met the latest love of my life Summer Ann Shadburn just days after she was released from prison on parole. 


This is NOT the same as just plain old snitching. This is a program directed at a target (not sure how or why any individual becomes a target) for the purpose of sustained emotional abuse and harassment that is intended to trigger a psychotic break in the target, or what's called a ""hyperarousal state"", by creating the illusion of a massive conspiracy being run against them, when in fact, it is just a few parolees taking orders to mess with the target's head in very subtle, and very weird ways. 


When triggered in a state of hyperarousal, the target's mind begins to greatly exaggerate what is happening, since he will begin to notice synchronicities EVERYWHERE, and begin to expect that EVERYONE is involved. Every minor coincidence or occurrence of bad luck will seem, to the triggered target, to be further validation of his increasingly delusional speculations as to what is really happening to him. At this point, the people who actually performed the  gaslighting and emotional abuse to trigger that mental state, can call the whole thing off, because the target's mind will then begin doing their work for them. Some people can even be triggered into having hallucinations by severe enough gaslighting and emotional abuse techniques, to cause the target to believe that supernatural forces are at work against him. To encourage that, the workers of the program will intentionally make such suggestions throughout the process, like references to demons, or being in a satanic cult, that are only meant to plant those seeds in the target's mind, that will become the focal point of the hyperarousal state.


Naturally, anyone listening to the frantic and dubious claims made by someone triggered into this state will perceive it as obvious mental illness, and reject the claims that a group of people could have done such things. But there are medically proven techniques that can be used to break a person's mind in this way. Cointelpro operations by the military use these exact techniques, and they are undoubtedly effective.


That is not to say the military, or any other intelligence agency is actually involved, that is unlikely, but the techniques used can be studied and executed by anyone. People with strong narcissistic traits can be especially naturally talented at these techniques, and such traits are very common within the prison population and organized crime culture.


There is nothing delusional about any of that, it is absolutely certain that these programs exist, are at least allowed by law enforcement if not affiliated with it, and that there is a conscious effort underway in media to exploit the delusional states of victims to fool the public into rejecting these legitimate claims by focusing more on the exaggerated claims made by victims, even though such delusions are the scientifically known consequence of the techniques being used on them by the program.



Getting Summer and I together to meet seemed to be an otherwise inexplicable goal of her son Reid's, who invited me over (the only time that ever happened) to hang out with him at Mike Miller's house (supposedly his mom's sugar daddy boyfriend, but who knows wtf these people really have going on) and, as an aside, meet his mom, who had just gotten out of prison, why not. I had been there once a few days prior, after Reid arrived at my house on foot, eventually needing a ride to see Summer for the first time. To make sure we saw each other, we went to the house first to pick up some cigarette money to buy everyone's cigarettes...


But when I actually got called over to hang out, Reid conspicuously stayed in the corner, silent, while Summer and I really seemed to hit it off, and it was obvious that we would get our hands on each other the second we got rid of Reid! To be fair, we were ""best friends"" first, for a while, which actually suited me, since I had been having bizarre ED problems since Cecily (most certainly also involved, or at least likely the vehicle through which I became targeted). But, soon enough, Summer's sexy, seductive, psychotic self was the cure, and we started going at it nonstop... BUT NEVER inside of Mike Miller's house, as she TRIED to make me do once, while he was outside mowing. No way I would have in the guy's own house. Looking back, she was definitely setting me up for another event for him to catch us. Dodged that one with decent morals, praise Jesus.


I know with absolute certainty that Summer Ann Shadburn's parole had a lot to do with me, and my name being on some sort of list that her son Reid and others must have had access to when I was, seemingly, randomly introduced to them one night. But that also may not have been random, can't say for sure.


I also know that Summer's parole officer from that time (Spring of 2018) is involved with recruiting parolees to work for the program. He came to my house at one point to pick up Summer for violating her house arrest in a staged event to make sure she wouldn't be allowed back by my parents (Yea I live with my parents, bite me, I was doing fine until... whatever, bite me), and she would be able to create the usual outrageous scenarios to gaslight me with. There was obviously no reason for me to ever go to any of the other places, where I'd been held at gun point naked, wrongly accused of stealing, or treated crappily by the owners even as Summer continued to claim they would be ok, and lure me back with seductive texts... but there were always issues, so at my house, where everything was fine, even though she evidently kept giving my mom dirty looks (which she told me herself), we seemed to have it made.


Obviously, that was no good for Summer's true motives, so she set up an event in which her brother (who was also the one who busted through her door to hold us at gunpoint in the middle of sex) tricked her with a fake emergency into giving my address, which was a ""ruse within a ruse"" as I was told he gave my address to the parole officer, who promptly showed up, NOT to arrest Summer for those violations, OR the several other crimes she would have been guilty of at that moment, but to simply take her away in a scene for my parents to witness so she would be banned from the house. She had persistently refused to simply pick up her home box and bring it too my house, citing that she had left in a rage, couldn't go back, and romantically just wanted to be with me and didn't care what happened to her.


Something was also significant about Summer's other son's release from prison. She was very adamant that I go with her to pick him up, even though I had broken up with her for all the bs. I did, since I didn't really want to break up with that sexy little psychopathic girl anyway... which greatly and immediately caused a huge uptick in the gaslighting...


But Summer's son was, remarkably, assigned the same parole officer as Summer. On the night/ morning of the Summer Solstice 2018, I wound up committing myself to the mental hospital for delusions that they were planning to sacrifice me for a satanic ritual (which they were intentionally trying to make me believe), EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE CONSPICUOUSLY STATED THAT THEY ALL HAD THAT SAME PAROLE OFFICER.


That parole officer is THE KEY. He recruits the people who carry out this unsanctioned, ILLEGAL counter intelligence operation, which amounts to DOMESTIC TERRORISM AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY. His name is Dave Gosse, a firearms trainer, Iron Chef hopeful, pop pop to 10... find him on the Book.

My name is Brady Burrell of  Corinth, MS.

I have a history of self harm and hurt myself worse than ever before one weekend during home leave. Now, there are around 4 people who have a lot of self harm scars and are regularly seen with new bandages, which is really affecting me.

She did catch my attention when I did this because I would sort of look away and ""look off into space"". She discussed it with me and my other teachers when we had a meeting about me. Basically they said the thought I was depressed and she mentioned the zoning out. I explained to her I really didn't mean it. They were all very understanding and she just continued to grab my attention whenever I did do this.

I notice it a lot more. It's not even that I'm bored, it just..happens. I have to out subtitles on when I watch tv because I'm paying attention one moment and then lost in my thoughts the next or I'm completely spaced out where, I'm not even thinking just zoned out.

As for the train of thought. I find myself talking about something but then I kind of go blank and keep saying ""umm.."" because I just can't get the words out.

All I want to know is after a huge rough patch, how do you put all the pieces back together to be who you used to really be?",20Sep2019,1
169,"If I do anything wrong I will hurt myself in some way (Ex. Stabbing myself with a pencil after missing a note while playing music)

I tend to overshare everything in my life.

Its EXTREMELY hard for me to read social cues. Sometimes when I do try to read them, I will be stuck on it for at least a week. Sometimes this lasts for months even.

I show emotions just to try and seem more human.

Its extremely hard to find something that gives me an happiness for more than a couple minutes.

The classic suicidal thoughts, depression, self harm, and semi-frequent panic attacks.

I will post more if I think of something else.",20Sep2019,1

171,"Okay I don't know where to start. But for some reason my mind is thinking the most worst outcome for some reason. The reason why I'm thinking about this is because I saw a escort in June. I know I'm a piece of shit. But anyways recently my mind is going full on haywire where it's thinking that maybe couple years down the line this escort might say fuck you, and accuse me of rape. I respected her during the time I was with her and didn't push any buttons. These were recent thoughts I had. I know I'm a piece of shit human being for going to see her but I know for a fact I would never do something like this. Another reason why my mind is like this is because she has my legal name and such. She is not from Canada where I live and stuff like that is legal, she's from Belgium by the looks of this cause I just searched her name and she is in medical school in Belgium. Like the only way for me to stop thinking like this is to ask her to delete my info like my name in such. I have a therapist I haven't gotten to this stage this recently came up. And I need help for something like this cause idk if I can handle these thoughts anymore and I'm scared I might do something to myself that I might regret.",20Sep2019,1
172,"I just got out of a session. I feel worse and worse after each session. It's been well over two years with no improvement. If anything, things are worse. 

I hate that I hate my life. Objectively, things are okay. I am able to afford to live in an above average suburb that has a great school for my kid. I have a job that allows me to pay the rent on my own. The house is in decent shape and all the bills are paid at the end of the month. This is not I wanted though. I never wanted to be a mom in the suburbs, let alone a single one. I never wanted to work in an office for a corporation. These things cannot change. 

The best I can hope for is for security and stability of my situation. There isn't really room for improvement.

I wish I could be grateful for all the things that I have, but how can your be grateful for things that you don't want? Everytime someone tells me that even when things are tough, ""you have that little girl to make you smile"" I feel like I'm getting punched in the gut. I wish I liked being a mom. 

The depression has been really, really rough lately. When it starts manifesting physical symptoms like nausea, shortness of breath, the feeling of being literally deflated....I just wish I could turn my brain off. I understand people who self medicate. If I wasn't so damn scared of how alcoholism runs in my family, I'd probably be wasted right now so I could turn this feeling off. 

This feeling.....it's ruining everything. I often think about ending it all....but my daughter is the only thing stopping me. I could never do that to her. She'd never get over it. Everyone else.....they'd evenly move on...but my kid feels too hard

Thinking about ending it both terrifies me and soothes me. I wish I could. Even if i somehow pull myself out of this hole....It would only be a countdown until the next time I'm here. I just couldn't do that to her. I know it's unfair to put her in that position....but it is literally the only thing stopping me. 

I'm getting help. I know it's not working, but it's the best I can do. It works with my work schedule and he reduced my copay. To find someone else would mean a copay i can't afford and trying to fit it into an already immovable schedule. I have no support with her that I can rely on so it's either leave work early so I can do it while shes in school or not at all. Hoping to find someone else that can help me better plus fit into that specific slot plus be willing to take a reduced copay......it doesn't seem to be a worthwhile expenditure of my already incredibly drained energy.

The last time I was able to get the depression into regression it was done with 2 to 3 sessions a week with a behaviorist and holistic therapist trained in trauma recovery. That's 100% not feasible. 

To be completely honest, I should probably be in a residential program at this point.....but where would that leave my kid? Her father's not involved at all and it would be a huge burden to any of my family. She's already dealing with the struggles of trying to cope with having an estranged alcoholic grandmother. Her mother going into a hospital would really, really hurt her unnecessarily. 

I've worked so hard to change and if my family knew....they'd go back to keeping me at an arm's length and not trusting me. This would irreparably break all of the relationships that I've worked so hard to repair after years of instability. 

It would also almost guarantee to tank my career. I know that sounds so shallow but I've worked so hard to have this career so I could support her and I without needing help. I can't throw that away. 

It's just fucked. I don't wanna be me. There's so much about me that I hate that I can't change. I wish I could start over. I know I can't so I wish I could end it. I know I can't end it but it's all that I think about. The fuck ton of antidepressants I'm on haven't helped. The two years of therapy haven't helped. The kind of help I need isn't accessible. I can't change the way things are because it would literally mean up ending my life with no guarantee of an improvement. I don't have the support that I would need to go through  this. 

I don't know what I hoped to get out of this.....maybe that it would look so ridiculous if I wrote it all down that it wouldn't bother me so much.",20Sep2019,1
173,"       I’m not a great person and deep down I know that. I always lie to other people but I can never lie to myself and I know that I belong with the scum of the lowest human beings, rotting in hell for all eternal for the things I’ve considered. If my family loved me I wouldn’t need to isolate myself. I wouldn’t need to take pills. I wouldn’t need to fake loving them. I’ve tried to believe things would get better for 7 years and they never have.  
          ADHD developed in my brother, I’ve had 12 friends move away in one summer, leaving me with no one, depression festered with anxiety following close behind, there are scars etched into my arms from times of blind rage that I still don’t regret, my family has fallen into poverty, we can barely afford to pay bills, I’ve cut people off, lost people I loved, three of us take meds and all 6 of us have needed therapy. There are people out to get me, watching me, my paranoia makes sure that that’s true, and I’ve attempted suicide. Twice. 
           I’ve tried to look up for 7 years, and it hasn’t worked. I’m pushing people away because I know they can’t stand me, and I’ve finally come to accept myself as a horrible person with a disastrous life. All I’ve ever wanted is for someone to love me and for me to love them back but I can’t and won’t find that. My face disgusts me and everything I do is repulsive in my opinion. The only harmony I can find is when I dig into my skin with a knife and wince in pain. The only reason I’m not gone is you guys.
[support is given, it was a group chat so I’m addressing all of them]
         I’ve known you guys for less than half a year and you’re already the greatest friends I’ve ever had so just know that you are the reason I’m not six feet under ground. That and my cat because I can never stand the thought of her standing outside my door waiting for me to come back when I never will. 
         You’re the only people I could consider family at this point, I feel like I can tell you everything and you’d never think less of me. The only thing I’ve ever wanted, the only thing I’ve ever strived for is contentment. The feeling of being held in someone’s arms, loved and loving someone back is something that I’ve never been able to feel before and I think the need will tear me apart. I don’t want to become myself. People always want to be someone, everyone has a role model no matter how much they’d rather not admit it. But all I really want is to turn away from the inevitable path I’ve been set on. 
           I wasn’t born into a lucky family, the few ‘talents’ you could say I have aren’t going to get me anywhere in life, I’m swamped with accusations of being fake for saying I’m depressed, that I want attention. I’ve called a suicide helpline worker once. He told me I was too young to have real problems. Then I hung up on him and slit my wrists.
           I have scar cream hidden in my room that my mom doesn’t know I’ve bought, and whenever I can, I have sweaters covering my arms. I’ve started to realize I don’t exactly know where my train of thought is at the moment, I don’t quite understand my goal with this, but never mind that, I go on tangents quite often anyways. You have one life to live, and if the world has taught me anything, it’s that chances are it’s not going to be a good one. Still, I have a roof over my head, clothes in my room, and food to eat, but how does that compare to bullying, constant and relentless, pushing me to the breaking point. 6th grade was the worst year of my life and I’ve haven’t gotten out of that low point in my life. 
            If I could wish for one hung in the entire world, it would be certainty. Not about other people, about myself. Am I really the person I think I am? Am I ugly enough to be called disfigured or beautiful enough to be an angel? Is my voice the scratch of sandpaper against ice, or the strum of a harp? The only thing that I know at this moment in time is how little I know. Everyone could be lying to me. Everything. Mirrors, videos, other people, my own mind. I’m still not certain if this is really life, and if not, what is? I just want to be sure about something. One point in my life where I can grab hold and remain stable in my storm of a head. 
            God, sorry you have to read all this. Ranting is just easy to me. Words are the only way that I can really express how I’m feeling. With all the exuberant ones out there, how could I not? Serendipity, melancholic, petrichor, nostalgia, everything is just so beautiful. 
            And everyday I’m happy, the next day feels like the most horrific I’ve had. There’s a defined amount of euphoria in each day, and using more than given is simply borrowing from tomorrow. I just don’t know anymore. I’m going to try and not talk tomorrow, I just want to listen, and take in what everyone is, was, and can be, to try and piece together at least one of those for myself.


        Anddddd..... now I’m not allowed to be alone anymore and am on the verge of being sent to a hospital. And people wonder why we don’t share our issues.",20Sep2019,1
174,"My brother and sister-in-law recently got a child. Normally, people would feel happy, excited and enjoy playing and taking care of babies.
