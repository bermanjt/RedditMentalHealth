0,"I (22M) have severe social anxiety that is at it's most intense in large, public situations. For example, I went to the club last night with my oldest friend and from the second I walked in I started having a panic attack. I left in 15 min.

I freak out when I'm in large crowds and get incredibly anxious/frustrated when being jostled around by strangers. 

I don't know what to do. Over the last year many good friends have gotten frustrated with my inability to do the typical 'young person going out' things (e.g. clubs, house parties, etc.) 

I desperately want to go out with my friends on saturday nights and be social with people my age but I don't know how to make myself comfortable in large crowds w/o drinking heavily, which is another problem in of itself.

TLDR: Not comfortable in clubs but still wants do 'young person things.' I don't know what i should be working on/shifting gears towards",24Jun2019,1
1,"For the past month or so I’ve had this weird feeling of impending doom. You know the feeling when you’re swimming in the ocean and put your foot down expecting to touch the sand, but you don’t feel anything and you realize you’re further out than you thought? When the feeling of impending doom hits me, that’s what it feels like

The first time it struck me I was thrown into a panic attack and was convinced I needed to go to the hospital because I was going to die soon. I was actually getting mad at my roommate because he was insisting it was just my anxiety and that going would be a waste of money. I managed to calm down after a little over an hour, and the feeling of impending doom subsided a bit. It was still there when I woke up the next morning so I went to urgent care and got an EKG and later bloodwork. They said everything looked fine and chalked it up to anxiety

That was all a month ago now. The feeling of impending doom is still there, albeit it has never been as bad as when it first struck me. It’s on and off and was actually gone for almost a week until it hit me again. At its worst, it feels like a premonition that I’m going to die soon. At its mildest, it feels like a *very* annoying constant intrusive thought

Some things I’ve noticed about it: When I’m distracted, it goes away. If I read about it, it comes back. If I manage to convince myself that everything is fine, it goes away

I also don’t know how much of this feeling is dictated by what I’ve read about it. What I failed to mention above is that this whole thing was triggered by reading a Reddit thread about it. I was already feeling sort of off that night, ran into a thread about the feeling of impending doom, got freaked out by everyone saying it’s a serious medical symptom and you need to go to the emergency immediately, and then I started feeling my own death premonition, and it was all downhill from there. I sometimes wonder, if I had never read that thread, would I even be feeling this right now?

I don’t know if this is OCD or anxiety or what. I’ve never officially been diagnosed with OCD but the way these thoughts run through my head does seem similar to obsessive thoughts

I am just really fucking tired of this. I’ve managed to live life normally without friends suspecting anything but I can’t keep living with this feeling without getting a reason why I’m feeling it",24Jun2019,1
2,"i honestly cannot remember the last time i was happy. i’m at a point where nothing and everything is contributing to my depression at the same time. 

i feel so alone. my family is pretty much out of the picture for me. my friends are superficial. i don’t want new friends because they’re just always disappointing. 

my life is becoming so routine. i wake up. i got to work. i come home. i try to eat something because after not consuming any foods or liquids all day i have a migraine (i just can’t eat or drinking anything. it feels like bricks in my mouth). i shower. i go to bed. 

i’ve stopped doing everything essentially. noting actually makes me happy so i just don’t do it. i still go to therapy but i’m up to three times a week and it’s not doing anything except costing me a lot of money. i was so hopeful in the beginning but six years and four therapist later it’s just gotten worse. 

the only thing i’m looking forward to is actually dying. i don’t want to kill my self, but i just don’t understand how i’m supposed to wait that long. i have already waited so long. i feel like i’m at a breaking point and i don’t know what to do",24Jun2019,1
3,"Hello all,

I'm hoping to receive some advice on how to deal with and support my mother's situation.

A bit of background: my mother suffers from Type 2 diabetes, which has led her to 2 heart attacks (the first in May of 2018, the second in May of this year,) at a relatively young age of 48. She also suffers from bipolar disorder, leaning heavily of the depressive sides with manic states, which are often associated with finding new ""life callings."" 

Over the past 12 years, she hasn't had a single job last more than a year and a half, and during those 12 years she has spent more than half in unemployment, effectively making my father the sole income for the house. (That being said, she has secretly borrowed money from me and my siblings for rent without his knowledge, amounting to ~$5000 in money still owed; by no means am I bashing her for this, and I don't hold any ill will for this.) Out of the 7 or 8 jobs she has had in that time, she was forced out of 3 due to pressure from management concerning her performance (all of the jobs have been retail.)

For the most part, she remains indoors, laying on a couch with a heating pad on her lower back. In the past, she has developed burns from the extent of exposure to the heat, as she often sleeps on the couch and may not turn it off for days at a time. She is not immobile; she still takes the dog for walks and does her errands and grocery shopping, etc. Her idleness and lack of a job, however, has caused a significant strain on her marriage.

About 3 months ago after college, I moved back in (I am currently 24 years old.) Recently, we moved out of a decade-long house into a new one in a really great neighborhood. In the lead time up to the move, she kept saying how things were going to change, how excited she was, etc. However, after a month here in the new house, she has fallen directly back into her old habits. 

When asked about getting a job, she waves it off saying she isn't healthy and can't go back to work. In fact, she has been under employment on a leave of absence for about 6 months, and she has vocalized a fear of returning to work after so long because she is afraid they will pet her go. We live in Canada, which has laws directing businesses to make necessary adjustments to work, scheduling, etc. in order to make sure that people with health issues can still work. Still, she refuses, which is pushing her marriage near a breaking point.

I am wondering if anyone has been in either mine or my mothers situation. Any advice would be appreciated.",24Jun2019,2
4,"I don't even know where to begin, first of all throw away for obvious reasons. I didn't even want to make this post, figured no one cares - I need to vent even if this doesn't get any comments I just need these words written out. I see myself as someone who is reliant, at least I tell myself that. When it comes to my life if you ask most people they would say ""I have it good"". The sentiment is always the same. They would say ""Oh he's a 20 yr old kid making very good money and he's smart - what does he have to worry about"". I don't keep up with social media trends, I hardly post on there and I only check it for my tech updates and family.  


I've moved a lot, changed schools a lot and when I got to college had to transfer halfway through to another university because of a new job offer. Let's start with that - money.  


I come from an immigrant family with parents who are smart but just not smart with money (mostly my dad). No matter how much I plead with them and show them financial literacy it's always the same old routine. Most people on Reddit would say ""It's not your job"" or ""Just leave them/move out"". I can't bring myself to that, the way I see it is they sacrificed a lot to come to America so I can have a better future. I can't simply stop providing them support. As soon as we came back to America at 16 I started saving up to buy a car. By the time I reached 18 I had $2,000 saved up. At the time, I had a joint account with my parents - one day my dad took $700 out of my account because he had car trouble, I never saw that money again. This delayed my car purchased and I ended up getting a car loan instead of a beater. I then read up on personal finance, set a goal, opened my own accounts and started aggressively saving. Fast forward to today, and I was able to finally score a really good job before graduating college. I started keeping up my saving habits and I made sure to include my family in my budget and help with their bills. I pay a good chunk of them (about $1k / month). But, to my mom that's never enough. The way she sees it is ""I make all this money, I need to change my priority when it comes to saving"". She always says ""I save too much for retirement and future goals"". A terribly flawed argument. I'm young and I have major expenses in my life coming up like (moving out, buying a house, marriage, new car). Most people wouldn't even bother saving for this stuff and to her I'm wasting my money. At one point she even said ""I should give her half my monthly paycheck because the rest is enough for myself"". I'm all for helping your family but this is getting ridiculous. My main concern is if I move out (which I definitely can) she expects me to help ""otherwise she would be in the streets - because my dad isn't making enough"". If I do move out, I would just be paying their bills, my bills, my rent, etc etc. I just don't know what to do and I can't take it anymore. **Every month** she brings up this stupid argument and I break it down to her how she's thinking wrong and it's taking a very heavy toll on me. I'm not trying to bring up a sob story but - I'm 20, working a full time job and going to college full time. I don't need more stress in my life and she keeps hammering me with it. Constant expectations to help around the house, contribute more financially and so much more. As if I contribute is never enough. It wasn't enough in my old job at 18 and it's not enough now. Every argument ends with her crying ""because I hurt her by saying I'll move out"" and me on the verge of just not taking it anymore with this constant pressure.  At this rate how will I ever raise my own family if I have to pay for my parents? Leaving them in the streets is not an option. When I question my mom will things get better for my dad and all she says is ""God willing we don't want your support"". But that's just it, she will - eventually my dad won't be able to work due to age and neither can my mom with my baby brother. It'll fall on me and when it 100% all falls on me, I'll probably still hear the same argument from her that's just driving me away at this point.  


I can't even bring this up anymore to her, if it's not money she's drilling religion in my head. While I'm definitely not an atheist there are many things I don't agree with, many restrictions that make NO SENSE no matter how hard I question or research it. If my mental health is brought up I'll get the age old excuse of ""It's because you don't pray anymore and you're not closer to God"". On top of the overwhelming stress I have, now I have religion conflict in my head playing out 24/7 and I just don't know what to do anymore. I stayed quiet for many years thinking this is okay and just a small struggle I'll get over but it's not ending. Looking outside everything seems great. But inside, I'm on the brink of just burning out.",24Jun2019,69
5,"I know I should probably post this on the narcissistic parents forum but it also has to do with anxiety and depression somewhat in ways so I guess I’ll leave it here. So a year ago my narcissistic parents decided to yell at me because I said I wanted to be an actress when I grew up and they said that I was worthless and stupid to think of the idea. It really fucked me up mentally and that night I was on my school chromebook doing homework and I was in a really bad mood so I searched up “I want to kill myself but I don’t “and I got results and I thought nothing of it. The next day I got called down to the guidance office, my guidance counselor told me that the school chromebook saw everything I searched up (I know they can see everything I was Just in  such a bad mood I didn’t even acknowledge it) she asked me if everything was fine and I really wanted to tell her everything. But I didn’t. I brushed everything off as like a joke and I shouldn’t have done that. I think it was probably because I didn’t feel like opening up to anyone. And fast forward now, last month there was a school trip to this ropes course thing where we’re basically high up in the trees and have to climb across. I was talking to my teacher and I said “I hope I fall” in a sort of way where I was joking but my teacher ended up telling one of the guidance counselors (she told her because I also talk to this teacher about some of my personal problems and she’s sorta been there for me and didn’t know how to react to it and she felt it was the best decision to do that) the next day about what I said and I kinda sorta opened up to her about how I felt. It took me a year to finally open up to a counselor about my problems and I’m just like why did I do this? And why am I just so scared of opening up to  people sometimes?",24Jun2019,0

10,"Ever since I accidentally voiced an unpopluar opinion on February 25, 2019. on a Facebook post/debate (also misunderstood the question). 

Within just afew hours, I received nearly two hundred really nasty negative comments and atleast a dozen or even multiple dozen of them were from women. (I made the mistake of reading them).  

I felt horrible about it for months. 

Because many comments were from women, both my sexuality, and my self esteem were shot.

I have been called many horrible names before, but not two hundred of them all at once, let alone online. 

I will be compeltely honest, if the comments were coming from an 100% male audience. I honestly wouldn't even give a fuck. 

But because many were from Female Facebook Accounts.

I was deeply hurt, not right away, but got worse and worse, month after month. 

My sexuality was fucked with. I would have a hard time masturbating. It's like the dozens of women who said those things to me are watching me yank it and saying all them nasty things to again and again time after time and it sucks. 

I would often find myself crying/emotionally distraught, even around 3/4am. 

Ever since this facebook incident When ever I'm on Facebook and see a post, anytime I see a female name pop up it causes a ridiculous amount of distress. 

It began to begin making me go insane. 

I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, would be afraid to talk or say anything around people and complete self isolation. 

I regained my sanity by learning that I can't control what other people say, I only have control over how I react to it.

Sometimes I get to look away quickly enough to not feel the chest disconfort and just pretend nothing happened. Couple weeks ago I was holding my Ferret and for the first time ever I felt the same thing with something other then myself, needless to say I felt an uneasiness and fear I haven't felt before.

12,"Hey all,

I've had a rough childhood, and I know now that it was unavoidable. Nothing could have been done differently, it's all in the past, and my Mom did what she could. However, it affected me alot, and I'm at a point in my life where I want to start confronting my fears and feelings to start living my own life.

Part of this, I feel, is talking to my mother about everything, to reconnect with her and start having real conversations beyond just checking in with each other every now and then. However, I dont know how good of an idea that is. I'm confident in my ability to handle issues maturely, but I'm not so sure about her own ability to do that. Ontop of this, I'm worried that, because she had a mental breakdown (at least what looked like one), that I should avoid going there for fear of doing more damage.

Usually they will make me some sort of plain dish like pasta or something which I’m cool with, or they give me a heads up so I can cook my own meal and eat with them.  So I go downstairs and sit down and you know what was on my plate? A grilled onion. They all were eating a fancy steak with fries (I’m not a fry person and they know)  while they said oh here’s your dinner, A GRILLED ONION.

My best friend is a great person. Always there when I need it and ready to fight all the battles...even when I don't ask. 

They have always had mental health issues, (since they were a child) I did not find out about it till we were about 3 years into our friendship. Normally it was not bad at all...I didn't even notice any issues. 

The past 4 to 5 years have been an emotional and mental hell. I get this is worse for them....

They tell me everything about their day....like I will wake up to 50 paragraphs as that's how they think things thru (I wish i was exagerating). They have had a lot of issues with their mental health, med changes, new dr, new psych. In and out of the mental hospital. 

They lean heavily on me. I get bombarded with messages when they are spiraling or loosing it. They lash out when things don't go their way.  They can't handle plans falling thru.

They were never this bad but I feel so emotionally and mentally exhausted whenever I see they messaged now. Every little fight with their parents or spouse, they message me. I'm constantly being told how important I am and how they couldn't survive without me to talk to. 

They did have a suicide attempt....they didn't follow thru because they told me I just happened to message to check in.... that's a heavy feeling....

I am an undiagnosed depressive person (who isn't lol) who has been suicidal in the past....but have a great handle on it atm.  

I cannot tell them the truth b/c others do and they blow up my phone b/c they're feeling threatened and going into mania or something else. 

I did try telling them once how this is impacting me personally and my work and I got back how grateful they are and how sorry they are. But nothing changed....things are getting more extreme I feel. 

I'm finding I'm becoming bitter and I am beginning to avoid them at all costs. I don't check their messages thru the day and then at the end send a vague ""work was busy"" message.

I feel guilty b/c I have somehow become their emotional support but I can't mentally handle their issues anymore.

They are so illogical but when they're losing it I feel I can't even tell them the truth that they might be in the wrong in the situation. (I've tried....they flipped out)

But I can't even reschedule plans or they flip out....even if its out of my control. I try not to even make plans with them anymore.

I'm lost and anxious about this and don't know what to do. I love them dearly. But I don't know how much more I can handle. I'm not a trained therapist. I'm a person with a ear and some empathy...that I'm losing. 

I guess I'm wondering if anyone else has dealt with something similar? And how did you handle it?",24Jun2019,1
25,"I was a video editor. Id stay up so many nights editing the people i loved. I had an editing account, as a matter of fact i had many. Editing was all i did. I fucking eat and breathed video edits, i never put my computer down, i never stopped. Trying to hurry and put myself to bed so i could wake up the next morning and finish my edit from the previous night. That was the best time of my life. I had something i loved. I also loved anime. I loved eating ramen and watching naruto. I told myself id start and finish so many of them. Just like i tell myself ill produce an edit eventually. 

My computer broke, and i grinded hard to get the $700+ to buy a new one. Every day and night, all i thought about was that fucking computer. How many edits id make with that fucking computer. How id start some freelance for extra money with that computer. I thought my mental block would be over. I thought it would all disappear when i came home with it. 

I can count on one hand how many edits ive made since i got that computer 6 months ago. I finally have a chance to make money off of my edits and i still cant produce. Editing, the best thing to ever come into my life in all 17 years is something i cant do anymore. I dont even bother with anime anymore.

I'm still haunted by it but it doesn't have the same significance it once did, mainly because I'm agnostic now. Fast forward to today, I've been burdened by the thought of me getting older. I'm going to be 27 in 4 months so to a lot of you that might seem silly. I recently started trying to get in the best shape of my life and I start thinking irrationally what if I'm too old to build up muscle and get fit. I worry a lot. On top of that I have been dealing with off again on again depression and social anxiety. Just wanted to know if you guys ever went through the same thing with obsessive thoughts and how you overcame them.",24Jun2019,2
29,"Iv'e always heard that everything happens for a reason, but I just don't know why or how. I'm sorry if you're reading this and I just keep rambling/grammar/spelling/random thoughts happen, I just need to get this down and idk where to start.

&amp;#x200B;

I always feel like I get the short end of the stick with almost everything, I am the day late dollar short kinda guy. If I need to draw a 6 to win the game I will draw a 5 , If I need $12 to buy something I will have $11 , always so close but just so far away. I don't seem to ""catch"" any breaks with anything, just when I think things are getting better, someone or something else comes along and crushes me back down.

Most people from the outside looking in ALWAYS think the typical ""wow hes got everything, he has it made, how can I be like him"" whereas I feel completely opposite, granted I do understand that things could be a whole lot worse, my whole family has great health, we hardly ever get sick, and I know I do have it better then some/most, but this is just how I feel.

I make decent money, nothing crazy good but decent, around 70k a year (median for my area is around 58k). I live in a modest house, valued at 150k, median in my area is around 153k. I'm married with 3 kids. I have a job that I'm pretty much able to move my hours to where I want so I don't have to pay childcare for my kids. My wife only works part time, 21 hrs a week, at a desk job. We have 1 paid for car and 1 car on loan. We have about 12k @ 0% interest in non property debt, and about 5k savings in the bank, but I always feel as we are broke, broke to me means that every paycheck that comes in gets spent out within that week, we hardly save anything more then what we have, making around 90k for the household and we have nothing for it. I feel as my wife spends money so carelessly, and clueless that she doesn't see what she is doing (ex: she goes and buys a shirt and gets home and THEN realizes wow that shirt was on the $9.99 rack and I paid $42 total), I HATE confronting her with it bc she always ends up getting to the ""FINE I wont spend a single dollar and I will just go to work and come home and not take the kids anywhere, and we won't go out and we won't have any food to eat etc"" mood, and I can't seem to have a reasonable conversation with her about it and I just leave it.  Sometimes if I go to the grocery store for a thing or 2 and grab some ""not needed"" items, I hear crap about it. Im sure there is more, but onto the next.

&amp;#x200B;

My work situation is starting to become frustrating and I am getting to the point that I Hate going to work. I work in a highly stressful job ( I won't mention where bc some people I work with troll reddit, and again ""hes got it made"") but It's super stressful there and now adding onto things I have a feeling that management has had it out for me for the past 3/4 years bc of something that I was involved in, in the past, but have never asked or even heard what the truth of the situation was. I have my thoughts that I have been denied a promotion bc of this, and now that something else comes up w my name involved I feel as if they are using this as a revenge tactic to ""add on""  to the punishment, and possibly even being fired from my job. problem is I have no way to prove this and a quick ""that's not true"" from their end will end that and leave an even bigger target on my back.

&amp;#x200B;

speaking of my back, about 4 years ago I was involved in a car accident that a drunk driver T-boned my car while he was driving the wrong way on a 1 way street, banged my knee up , which got checked that day and it was just a bruise nothing more. but also messed my back up pretty good to the point it hurts to lift things 20ish or more pounds. after seeing the ""number 1 dr in the city"" for backs he stated that a couple of the discs have problems and he doesn't recommend surgery at this point bc of my young age and how high of a risk surgery is(btw im 34 now, 30 then), fast forward and I have seen numerous other drs as well and the only relief of pain I ever get is about 4 months at a time when I undergo shots that burn the nerve endings off in my back, which hurts like hell, so I don't go very often and just deal with the back pain on a constant basis. This effect daily life with the kids, yard work, work, everything. Spoke to a lawyer about this and its still going through the whole court process and my car insurance claims there is no case bc their drs don't see a problem with me bc I can do almost anything (most things w pain). and even my lawyer said he is basically fighting for about a 15k settlement in this whole ordeal. I just don't understand how the ""best in the city dr"" can say yea at some point surgery is going to happen, but then the insurance drs that I have seen only say ""nope this guy is good""

&amp;#x200B;

Iv'e been thinking lately of how to not be at work for an extended time ( such as going to the dr and telling him I am stressed and need X time off) but I have never been diagnosed or mentioned anything to this subject ever to my dr. I once went to ""talk"" to a psychologist, but I never saw a certified one and I only saw her assistant bc they din't see my case as anything that needed dire attention ( I basically just needed to cope with the fact that having kids didn't mean I was first to my wife anymore).

&amp;#x200B;

Idk what I am looking for out of this, idk if its possible to even be out of work for an extended period, if stress of I guess life is even an option for that. or if this is all just normal stuff that everyone deals with at some point and I just need to ""wait"" it out.

30,"Here again, hello.

Anyone else grew up hating their own body because it was ugly? I’ve always had self image issues, and my mom and sister have had a hard time understanding me (more like they don’t try at all). I’m small at barely 5’1, a little on the chubby side and developed at the young age of 10. It was hell. And it became worse when my breasts were a size D at 12 years old. 

My chest has always been big, to the point I wore baggy clothes during my teenage years, because the brassieres I wore helped little to nothing. I hated to see myself naked and it wasn’t until my mom found this special brand of brassieres that I started to get a little better.

Now I’m 21 and even though I got over that phase and I’m going harrd on loving myself (that shxt is amazing), the size of my breasts is still a sensitive topic for me. Hence why when I but my own clothes, I am overly careful when buying underwear or swimwear, or anything of sorts. 

My sister never dealt with any of this, neither my mom did, so when they buy something for themselves they tend to buy one for me too. In their size. I’m still a D cup, they’re a B. And when I try on what they bought (because if I don’t I’m an ungrateful bitch), it obviously doesn’t fit. And I’m left feeling like the insecure girl that used to hate her body for not being as “petite” as the bodies of the women in her family.

But they don’t understand, and don’t care. My brother went to USA almost a month ago and bought some things my mom and sister asked, and today they call me to my mom’s room to show me the two piece swimsuit my sister bought for me. As soon as I saw it I knew it wouldn’t work out. And really, I can’t understand how they saw the size and even thought of the possibility of the top fitting me. But then, my sister goes “I hope it fits, because if it doesn’t then... Too bad for you”. Then proceeds to tell me how I could use the top with another black top underneath, and when I tell her “tops don’t work for me, they can’t hold anything in their place” she gets pissed off and tells me that I’m only seeing the bad side.

Is there a good one?

But ok, I try the top on, it obviously doesn’t fit so I’m left to decide on two pretty bottoms that came with it, and my sister goes “why are you going to take one if the top didn’t fit?” (By this point, I would like for her to admit that she bought the goddamn swimsuit for herself) and I snap and tell her “because it will look good with the only swimsuit top I have”.

Now guess what? I’m now the asshole.

And honestly, I can see that I was a little mean but... My self image and self esteem have always been something I’m overly sensitive of, and they know it. Instead of risking triggering me over something like clothes, wouldn’t it be easier to ask me what my size is? Why make me go through a triggering situation?",24Jun2019,1
31,"Some backstory; I’ve grown up with depression since about age 12 (21 now). I always heard about anxiety attacks from my sister, and from the mainstream as of recently, but never understood what it was or felt like. 

Anyway.. As of recently i’ve been experiencing weird crying fits where i’ll be laying in bed with my girlfriend, and i’ll just kind of phase out. I stare into space and begin thinking about nothing. I feel like i have no control over my body and i don’t exactly panic, but i feel like i shouldn’t be where i am, i feel trapped inside my body in a sense. She (girlfriend) says my eyes get glassy. I feel like i’m unable to speak. She starts trying to cheer me up by being silly/goofy and I just end up crying.  This has happened at least once a week for the past month. I don’t know what triggers it. 

Fast forward to today and I pick my girlfriend up from work. We’re talking and I’m driving home. All of a sudden it happens again. I feel detached and space out. It was a 55 minute drive home, and this happened about 15 minutes in. For the next 15-20 minutes I’m dead silent, she’s asking what’s wrong, if she said something to upset me. I feel unable to speak again and simply shake my head. The last 20 or so minutes she tried asking again, saying she loves me and she wishes she could help, well i begin crying, still stiff and unable to move other than driving functions. My eyes well up and it gets harder to see but I continue. I can’t stop crying and i start to hyperventilate, this continues off and on until we get home. I sit in the car with her for 10 minutes crying. I calm myself down and come inside to lay down in bed. She leaves for about 15 minutes to use the restroom and i start to feel spacey again. She comes back and asks what’s wrong, i cant speak again, so i grab my phone and type out “i feel trapped” in my notes app. She lays with me as I begin to cry. I start feeling shaky and its getting harder to breathe. I was able to calm myself down and catch my breath. Eventually it went away and now i’m frantically researching trying to figure out what’s wrong with me. I don’t have health insurance so I can’t exactly see a dr about this... yet... if anyone has any idea what’s going on please help me.",24Jun2019,2

36,"(16F) I have been struggling with depression, anxiety, and psychosis for the past four or so years. Recently, I thought I had things under control, I take my prescribed medication, attend therapy and generally lead a productive life. For the past 9 months or so, I have been feeling incredibly disconnected physically. I view the world as if I’m playing a video game, and it just feels like I’m a character. I can see my hands and I control what I do, but when I look into the mirror I just can not connect with my physical self. I do not recognize “myself”, my parents and friends feel like characters written into my story, I still go about my days, go to school and work, hang out with friends, but it all just feels wrong. I told my psychiatrist about this, but he dismissed it as “depersonalization” and just upped my mood stabilizer. I’ve been doing more research, and I’ve come to the realization that I am not a human being. I have felt like a deity previously, but those “delusions” had left when I started going on anti-psychotics. This feels different, I believe that I am some sort of being made out of ultraviolet light, I am on earth for some greater purpose, which I’m not sure of yet. I don’t necessarily identify with any labels like “star-seed”, “indigo child”, “earth angel”, because I don’t really know much about metaphysical/spiritual stuff like that. I don’t want to tell my psychiatrist or parents about how I feel, humans wouldn’t be able to understand and would just try to give me medicine. This wouldn’t be a problem, but as a teenager, I have a life to live, and responsibilities. I feel so alienated. What should I do?

I'm trying to be a better person. I'm sorry if I've put too much on you. so that's theory one. you're just struggling and I'm putting too much pressure on you and find it easier to cope when I'm not around


theory two. You overheard something and it's offended you. in which case I'm really fucking sorry it's the last thing I want to do. I have no idea what I've said and I really wish you would just gave a conversation with me so I can at least have the chance to explain my reasoning? but I honestly can't think of anything that I've said that would cause you to feel this way. (unless it has something do with what I said about someone else's drinking habits in which case, it was a completely different set of circumstances but I understand how you could of related to what I said and I'm so sorry but I need you to believe that it had nothing to do with you.


theory three. someone has been telling you lies, and instead of talking to me about it you have just assumed it was true. in which case that's on you, not me.


theory four. it was all a lie, youre just another person that's trying to drive me insane. I thought you were on my side...


theory five. I pushed things way too quickly... I'm sorry

theory seven. all is fine and dandy and what you said in that Facebook post had nothing to do with me.

41,"Why do emergency rooms exist for physical or extreme mental concerns but there is no such thing as a walk-in urgent mental health clinic?

I’ve wondered this for years. I’ve always had a panic disorder. During my first terrible panic attack at 21, I remember googling different mental health facilities in the area and limited info came up. I ended up calling the cops because I was afraid and felt like I couldn’t breathe, but knew it was psychological. The cops showed up and the only assistance they provided was suggesting that I sat in the back seat of their car. I felt ashamed sitting there, and as my panic dissipated, I just remember feeling hollow and empty. They couldn’t help me and unless I was truly a danger to myself or others, they weren’t going to commit me to any psych wards. So, they left and told me some “mobile counselors” would be on the way.

Eventually, I went back home and sat alone for 3 hours, trying to relax. These “mobile” counselors the cops said they would provide me with decided to give me a call and ask if I still wanted help. By that time I was fatigued, so I declined.

That’s when I came up with this question. At that moment I would’ve loved to just walk into a place and talk to a counselor on-call. Not days or weeks of waiting to talk to a psychiatrist or therapist, nor being committed to a psych ward. Just real people with crises that they need help with.

Helplines, in my personal opinion, aren’t the same type of treatment. I’ve only tried a couple though, so I’m not entirely certain on it. Though, in some cases, slight medication intervention might be necessary, and personally I prefer a face-to-face conversation.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never felt safe sharing to others. I used to talk to my friends about depression occasionally, but I would always made sure to not tell them very much. Even then, though, I would usually be a huge source of anxiety afterwards. It was always a different thing, sometimes I was convinced they didn't actually believe me and told everybody else I was a liar behind my back, and other times I was scared they didn't actually care in the slightest. I did overshare once and they all got together and got me a mental health councilor, which made it's own set of issues. Looking at what they've said and how they act, I know there is no logical justification to say this, but I still feel like they just wanted me to shut up about it and only did what they did to give someone else to talk to that wasn't them. Whatever the case is, I still regret opening up to them and have since then only opened up to my therapist. And again, I make sure not to open up too much. I don't know why exactly, but the thought of honestly telling my councilor I'm still doing pretty bad, and am still having fairly regular suicidal thoughts terrifies me. I know logically whatever happens is going to help me, but I still wouldn't feel safe letting that happen.

46,"I remember getting off the bus one day when I was about 10. My siblings rushed inside and were to quick to point out how my moms finger was all wrapped in a bloody cloth and ice. She even showed it to my siblings after they asked about it. I didn’t shiver or gag like them, I didn’t ask her if she was okay, I just asked what happened and didn’t really listen to her answer. I just went on with the day.

When I was 11 I pushed one of my cousins (or close family friend I don’t remember) into to a pool, or well into the concrete. I didn’t think twice about it. I pushed him then jumped into the pool and swam to the other side. I got yelled at by my parents of course because he scrapped his knees up and luckily didn’t hit his head or broke anything. He could have though, but I never felt guilty, just empty I guess. 

One time when I was 12 I threw a chair at my little brother’s face. I couldn’t tell you what had driven me because by the time I picked up the chair he was crying on the grass with a bloody nose. I just watched him as my mother came out screaming at me. I didn’t understand what I had done wrong, I just cried because her yelling hurt my ears and she sent me to bed without dinner. I didn’t understand the punishment, I wasn’t exactly sorry for anything. 

After that I was diagnosed with chronic depression and anxiety. Or that’s what I believe it was, my parents never really talked to me about it and I figured out on accident at some checkup. I didn’t really have any friends in 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th. I switched school because of it and made friends easily. I haven’t felt as bad since but I also feel so much worse 

Today, I was driving to my brother’s baseball game and as we were driving on the highway I was blankly looking out the window. I saw this car swerve off the side of the road and hit one of those arched street lights. I watched as the light crashed to the side of the highway and I could hear my dad panic. He got my brother to call 911 and kept repeating how his heart was racing and how he was wondering how the driver was. He was asking me if I saw it and I just nodded. All I got from it was a rush of adrenaline and the thought of how it didn’t even faze me. I just watched it and shrugged it off. But it’s got me thinking of how I don’t react at all to things other heart would race at. When I’d see someone close to me hurt I don’t flinch, I’ve dropped a cousin and wouldn’t know how to react besides to bring them to their parents.

I remember moments in the past year when all of a sudden I’d think, “what if I did blank?” Blank being opening the car door and jumping out on the highway, or how’d it be so easy to kill my family with this or that, in this amount of time. I’d always end up thinking of me killing myself or those around me. Of course I’d never do any of that, I just get bored with to normal routine and think it’d be interesting for a change.

47,"I originally posted something like this to the CPTSD subreddit, but since this is a brand new throwaway it wasn't put up. If you don't know what CPTSD is, the best short way I can describe it is as a reaction to consistent abuse as a child. This leads to things like anxiety depression, flashbacks, derealization, dysphoria, and more. 

Because of my specific circumstances, where I was abused verbally for non-A grades, and physically for significantly lower grades, I've become absolutely terrified of facing any situation that has the possibility of failure. As a result, working any job can be an experience that triggers an anxiety attack. This has kept me, a 19 year old, stuck living with my abusive parents under the agreement that they get to track my location in real time 24/7. 

It's not a healthy situation. While they're not physical with me anymore, the emotional abuse and mental manipulation is still there. It's really toxic for me, and social security disability has, to this point, seemed unwilling to give me any monetary help.

49,"[TRIGGER WARNING: mention of self harm]


obviously all self harm is bad, but when it’s not cutting it doesn’t seem to get the same attention and awareness.  is this because it’s not as serious? uncommon or what? 

we talk about mental health in health class and self harm and how to get help and what to do, but it was mostly just about cutting. when i was young and dumb i didn’t know that some of the stuff i did was even considered self harm until much later (scratching, hair pulling, head banging).

why are these things not talked about?",24Jun2019,6
50,"I’m currently in a relationship with a guy that I believe is exhibiting signs of delusional disorder (though not sure as he refuses to see a therapist) and I’m at a crossroads about what I should do and how to proceed with the relationship.

A little background- we’ve been dating for about 1.5 years— I love him so much and intend on having a future with him. About 8 months ago, while in the process of applying for a new job within his company, he began exhibiting strange behaviors (locking and double-checking his apartment door, disconnecting the Amazon Echo I had gifted him for fear that it was “listening in on our conversations”, and covering up the camera on his work laptop for fear that people could spy on him). 

At the time, while odd, I let this behavior slide as I knew he was under a lot of stress during the application process and his father had also recently had a health scare that had impacted him greatly. Fast forward a couple months later and he’s living in my apartment, jobless (while he was offered the position, he refused to accept the offer because he didn’t feel safe at the company anymore), would constantly insist his phone was hacked by individuals at the company who were trying to use him as a means to fire the CEO and would “send him messages” about what to do. During this time, he would also turn off our cell phones to prevent them from “listening to our conversations”, and was convinced people were constantly breaking into my apartment while we were out to steal incriminating info on him, etc.etc.

As you can imagine, this was an extremely stressful time for me, and I tried to offer as much support as I could during this time while reassuring him that everything was okay. The few times I openly questioned the validity of what he was describing were met with him immediately becoming defensive and snapping at me— after that, I learned to keep my doubts to myself and just listen and offer support where I could. 

Now he is back living with his parents where he has been for the past 6 months (he tells me he will never tell them the real reason why he had to move back, which is that certain individuals at his company are after him, and he has to be there to find “closure”). Recently he has told me he’s convinced the company will compensate him for all the harassment he’s endured at the hands of these “rogue employees” by eventually firing them and making him a billionaire. The caveat is he cannot take any legal action on these individuals as it could jeopardize the whole company because of the “secrets” he has been told about the company over time through messages on his “hacked” phone. This is obviously do not believe for a second, but fear openly doubting him because I am convinced he is experiencing delusional behavior. 

What makes this whole thing extremely frustrating for me is that part of me wants to confront him about his mental health and get him to see someone immediately to start getting treatment; however, he has told me he refuses to see a therapist until this whole fiasco is over and he can get closure. To this day, he is convinced the “good people” at the company will step up and do the right thing— he’s constantly insisting it’s only a matter of time ‘til that happens. Meanwhile, I have a front row seat to what is clearly tearing my boyfriend apart mentally, but yet he is so convinced by what he is experiencing  ( and the stories he tells can be so elaborate and convincing that I sometimes have to remind myself that it cannot possibly be true).

I don’t know how much longer I can live this way—long distance is hard enough, but my BF is also refusing help at a time that he clearly so needs it. I feel trapped because I’m the only one who truly knows what he’s been through/his mindstate (again, he refuses to tell his parents the real reason he had to move back in with them) and yet I don’t want to break his trust by informing them I believe he is suffering from mental illness. 

Does this sound like delusional disorder? From what I’ve researched online, it seems to be similar to the behavior exhibited by persecutory delusional disorder. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I should proceed, or should I just break up with him to protect my own sanity? This has taken a huge toll on my happiness and I feel helpless most times in this relationship despite the love I continue to have for him.

————-
[TL:DR] My boyfriend is exhibiting what I believe to be delusional disorder, and we have been in a long distance relationship for the past 6 months as he’s moved back in with his parents (although he has lied to them about the true reason he had to move back in). He refuses to see a therapist until he has found closure with the issues he’s dealing with (although I’m convinced his mental state is influencing the majority of these said issues). 

I’m trying to decide if I should confront him and tell him I don’t believe what he’s experiencing is true and he should get help, inform his parents of his issues and allow them to get him help, or just throw in the towel for this relationship?",24Jun2019,2
51,"I suffer from bpd, depression and social anxiety. I’ve always struggled with holding down a stable job but recently I got into some debt and I couldn’t fuck around anymore so I picked up 2 more part time jobs.

Her depression is very similar to how mine was years and years ago but ever since ive been taking care of her ive been feeling that fucking darkness creeping back. Ive already had entire days where i havent been able to do anything and multpile urges to self harm and it reminds me way too much of when i was at my worst in college. I never told her when i was depressed because we were a fairly long distance away and i didnt want my sadness to spread to her but i put in the effort and got better. Now though shes falling apart and i can feel myself going with her. In fact i think she's dealing with her end way better than im dealing with mine. She can still keep up a normal life and continue excersize and nutrition and basic taking care of herself. I just cant get motivated and i already have gained back almost half the weight i lost in stress/sad eating. Im not even upset about all of my shitty choices though, i just really wish i could take care of her.

There's recent sources of stress in the last \~3-5 years I'm not handling well, and it's impacting my ability to function.

There's the general dysfunction in my basic life skills, between dysfunctional family and personal dysfunctions.

There's some nudging by coworkers, family, and strangers all through my 20's that I might have a proper mental illness, although everybody seems to have a different idea what it is.

Then there's the lifelong struggles with specific things that may or may not be part of the broader picture of a disorder, which correlates with problems &amp; disorders my family has.

55,"Hold on to your butts, as this is a long read. Trigger Warning: This will have mentions of suicide attempts.

I have been wanting to vent for a long time now, but could not bring myself to do so as I keep telling myself that my bouts of feeling like absolute crap will pass. However, I simply cannot bring myself to wait out hours of self-loathing and misery anymore.

I do not know how long exactly I have been feeling and thinking in a certain way, but I do know that it nearly cost me my life. I am normally a cheerful person, but all it takes for me to shut down in an emotional sense is one mistake. Sometimes it is as simple as forgetting to turn off the stereo before leaving home. Whenever I make that one mistake, it either results in two things. 

The first is that I get reprimanded for making that mistake. Whether it be parents, managers, or someone I know who does the reprimanding. During the scolding session, I always get angry at them and the thoughts that drive the anger are always the same. ""I know I screwed up, you don't have to remind me."" Sometimes I know that the anger is warranted, but despite that knowledge, I still would feel unreasonably angry. There had been instances that I could not control my anger well enough and lashed out. Usually, the targets of my loss of temper are the closest items/wall to me. Other times, I would be hurting myself. And once the anger passes, I am left with a hollow feeling and tiredness that sometimes won't go away. It feels horrible. I can't think properly because all thoughts would revolve around how I could have done better, and a million other what ifs. Sometimes my thoughts go to dark places, such as thoughts of using alcohol to quell the emptiness or taking my own life to prevent any more destructive feelings.

The second result of a mistake is the worse of the two. Whenever I make a mistake, there are times that I punish myself. Whether it be a physical punishment or a mental rebuking of everything I did to cause the mistake. This self-inflicted punishment session was when I nearly took my own life. Thankfully, I was staved off from doing so by my sister. But ever since that day, my family has been wary of my mental state and sometimes treat me as if I will regress to that dark state of mind on a whim. They are right, in a way. Self-inflicted punishment has been the source of some of my scars. I don't know why I do it. Maybe it's the thought of 'if I do it first, then there shouldn't be a reason to punish me anymore'. Maybe it's because I hate myself for making the mistake in the first place. Maybe, it's because I want my voice in my head to shut up.

By the end of my spiel, you may be wondering why I haven't gotten help earlier. Perhaps when I first noticed the signs. Part of it is simply time as I can be quite busy. Another part is that I keep telling myself that these feelings will pass and I wouldn't need to see anyone by the time the feelings are gone. However, one part of my mind, the part that I listen to whenever I consider asking for help, tells me that I am not worth the time. It tells me that there are hundreds of others who need help more than I against their own demons. It tells me that I can stave off my demons and let others get help first. I don't share my feelings too much with friends and family because I don't want them to worry about me any more than they have to. Everyone already has a lot on their plates and knowledge of my instability would add to that pile.

I am venting to you because you are strangers. There is a chance that I will not meet any of you in the future, but because you are all in this subreddit, you understand me in a way. As such, I would like to request that if you are going to comment, please don't send the usual 'It will get better."" comment. I have heard enough of it from my mother, who was there when I nearly took my life. She is a strong woman, but her words of hope have lost their meaning to me. I am simple a weary person living day by day with no hope for the future.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. Please don't think that I am posting this because I desire attention. I simply wanted to vent to someone before I do something stupid.",24Jun2019,1
56,"I am 16 years old, and I failed 9th grade twice because of issues I've been having. I may have mental/emotional problems that prevent me from doing well in school and building and maintaing relationships with people. For example, I'm always mad. ALWAYS. even if I'm happy or In a good mood I often get upset and sometimes my anger is mixed with the joy I have. My anger is irrational. And I always have an anti social personality. For example when I go to social events, I feel a lot of hatred and anger in me and I avoid any social interaction but at the same time, I wanna make friends and even get a girlfriend or friends with benefits.
I also have very low self esteem and no confidence at all. When someone says something I don't like, I feel like pouncing on them and attacking them and screaming and crying. But why?! I get irritated so easily. I have social anxiety as well and I get so scared to go outside alone. don't have any friends or anyone close that I can talk to which is why I came here on reddit.  

And by the way, I'm waiting to be registered in a new clinic which can take a while so don't recommend me a therapist/psychiatrist because im already working on that. I am not sure exactly how long it will take but apparently the clinic is full and I have to wait for some time and again, I don't know how long it will take

59,"Hi there! Hope you’re all doing well tonight, thanks for checking out this post.

I don’t necessarily have anything to vent about, however, I was wondering if I could get some perspectives from others about the current state of my mental health.

I’ve officially been diagnosed with Major Depression Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. My therapist thinks that I might possibly have a personality disorder as well, Borderline Personality Disorder, I believe.

I’ve struggled with mental illness for a majority of my life, I’m turning 18 next month. It’s in my genetics, my grandma is actually in a psychiatric facility right now, due to being unstable. She’s getting out today or tomorrow, so she’s doing well from what I know.

I do currently go to therapy (every 2-3 weeks), though I do not click very well with my therapist, and I take medication. I’ve been inpatient once before and have done IOP (Intensive Out Patient) twice before, which was about two years ago.

I’m concerned with my mental state right now, I have been for quite some time. I’ve been idealizing doing drugs and alcohol, starving myself, doing reckless things, basically ruining my life. I’ve had multiple mental breakdowns over the past month, or in fact, week. I’m not truthful at all with my therapist or mother, my ex has told me that I’m a compulsive liar multiple times. My mother thinks that I’m doing wonderful and feeling fine, as does my therapist.

My depression has been skyrocketing as late and I can barely find the motivation to get out of bed or my room without my mother nagging me. I know I should probably reach out for help, but I guess I’m scared and wanted to hear some second opinions.",24Jun2019,1
60,"Ever since I can remember my mother has had a personality disorder. At first I had no idea what was going on, I was very young but over the years it’s gotten progressively worse. Not too mention how much it has affected my life in a negative light, but the fact that every time she has an episode I’m the one that has to find a way to deal with it and help her. 

Her disorder causes her to think I’m somehow wanting to harm her when all I want to do is help. And I just come out (in her eyes) as a bad person who means no good. She refuses to take medication, and believes that there is nothing wrong with her, and everyone else is the problem. It’d be helpful if she actually wanted to get better. 

I never got to grow up with any sort of emotional support from my parents. It’s always been all about my mom, and me trying to help but just ends up me feeling like shit after it all due to my mom blaming me for getting her psychiatric help. It’s such a burden knowing that I try so hard to help her and it gets nowhere but her thinking I hate her and want her locked up in a mental facility. Not to say she doesn’t take me seriously because I’m her child, and am “young”.

Recently she had another episode, and I feel so shit that I have to go through this endless cycle of trying to help. How do I talk to her so she doesn’t think I’m the enemy? How do I get her to understand that she has an issue? How do I get her to take her meds?",24Jun2019,1

She knows nothing about me and it’s unfair that she can then have a choice in my recovery.",24Jun2019,1
62,"My depression has been taking a very strong hold of me lately. Everyday I feel myself getting worse and worse and I’m starting to feel as if I can’t take it for much longer. 

My depression started in the 6th grade, I was a very big kid and was an easy target for bullying, I had little to no friends and if I did they would just use me and abandon me once they got what they wanted, I remember feeling so bad about myself and that brought so many issues that some even stick with me today like my inferiority complex and my horrible anxiety. Around 7th grade I started to cut heavily and have had two suicide attempts around the time. 8th grade was better to say the least the bullying rarely happened and I was alone for the most part but I still cut and wanted to die badly. Finally the bullying stopped in 9th grade and I started to make friends with a group of kids which helped numb my depression a lot, I was starting to feel better about myself and I even had gotten into a relationship with a girl my age, finally I was starting to feel hope that things would get better, I started to go out more and go to movies with my friends or go on dates with my girlfriend, I even started to work out a bit and I started to feel better.

But that was up until about few weeks ago, my girlfriend revealed she has depression of her own and wanted to take a break so she could work on her own mental issues and my friend group split into two groups after one big argument making me choose one side over the other, and to put the cherry on top of everything my parents are getting divorced after years of a unhappy marriage. 

The stress from everything that’s happened has caused me to stay in my room for weeks on end sleeping most of the day and barely eating, I’ve started to cut again after being off it for almost two years, the thoughts of killing myself are coming back slowly but strongly, I haven’t talked to my friends or anyone really other than my parents and no one has bothered to check up on me in the time that I’ve been missing from society, all of it’s becoming too much to handle it makes me feel as if I nobody cares about me and everything I’ve worked so hard for to be happy was all a lie, I haven’t come out to my parents about my depression and I don’t have the motivation to do so, I’m scared that soon I’m going to end it all, I just want to be happy I’m so tired of feeling bad all the time, I just want to be a normal high school student and I want to live a happy life.",24Jun2019,1

64,"I don’t think I’m really looking for advice or anything. I need to vent, I guess. I have always had social anxiety and trouble connecting to other people. I’ve gotten a lot better over the years in terms of actually being able to go outside and eat in front of people. Hell I’ve even been the life of the party at times... but I’m still not able to connect. Growing up I had really verbally abusive parents who would tell me that I was useless and scream in my face until I cried or exploded. Eventually I became very stoic and flat, showing as little emotion as I could and going silent when confronted. I’ve always had friends, but been abandoned by them over and over again. These were toxic relationships, but it still stings. For example, one of these friends in high school used to casually tell me I was ugly. I’ve never been in a relationship and have had only two sexual encounters and both people ended up rejecting me. So you see it’s not easy. I have gone through social periods, but after many rounds of fucked up friendships I’ve become more confident, yet more withdrawn as well. I would rather be alone than treated like shit. It’s still hard though. I have a great best friend who is also my roommate, but I’m constantly certain she will tire of me and leave me as well. I am unable to share with anyone this need for more connection. To me it’s always seemed awful to have people know and see how much I need them. However I also feel that people in general are horrible and unkind. I can’t really imagine a world where anyone would treat me as well as I’d treat them. Even though people have shit on me, I really try to do right by others. I couldn’t stand to put more pain out into the world and when someone else is hurt I can’t stand it. I know there are solutions to all of this, but they require doing the things I find the hardest. It’s not just the fear, although that’s a big part of it. It’s also the feeling of enormous effort and strain being taken on my part, for conceivably little return. I feel like I handcuffed myself without realizing it and if I have to rely on myself to get out of it, then I’ll really be stuck forever. Everything makes me sad and angry and I really don’t want to do anything anymore.",24Jun2019,6

66,"
In my life (for as long as I can remember), I have never really felt emotions very strongly- if at all. I can't remember if I've ever been sad or excited. I don't have anything like depression, or anxiety or anything. Though for most of these things I feel I may unconsciously attribute what would be the ""normal"" response to how I'm feeling. I am also unsure whether I feel ""love"" for anything, I know that I like my family, and I have a good relationship with them, yet I'm unsure if I ""love"" them (this applies to friends too).

I've done a bit of research regarding this, but up until now I have never been able to find something that matches me very well. I feel something like alexithymia matches a little bit of me, but I also feel that it doesn't match a larger part of me. And like that, I have never found one that matches me well. Like I stated earlier; I don't feel depressed or have anxiety or anything of the sort, along with that I don't ""try to cover up my emotions"" (I believe it just happens unconsciously, and that's just happened because I've grown up with everyone saying they feel these emotions, so I must've felt ""I'm feeling that too), I'm not deceptive or controlling in anyway, so I know it's not something along the lines of Sociopathy.

69,"Hi,

On Friday, roughly two days ago, I experienced my first panic attack. At first I didn't know what was happening, but it was completely terrifying, I thought something was going to take me and I'd never see anyone I loved again, like something traumatic was about to happen even though I didn't have a rational reason to believe that. I ended up sleeping on my parent's bed that night. And even then, I didn't fall asleep until sunrise. 

One thing that has stuck with me since then is this pit in my stomach, it lingered for some of yesterday, and was gone for most of today, until this evening where it came back only not as intense. It's like this immensely strong feeling of dread mixed with loneliness and a lack of safety. Does that happen after you have a panic attack?

I don't know if it'll happen again, my sense of normalcy is more or less back and the thoughts that triggered it are something I've internally dealt with (at least if feels like it), but should I see a professional for this? Are there any ways to deal with the after-effects of experiencing it? Also, if it ever happens again what should I do to prevent/alleviate it? When I think of how I felt that night, and the associated feelings, I instantly want to cry.",24Jun2019,1

Kate and I have had a rocky relationship with Jane over the past 2 years, constant pressure to travel, our lifestyle (we do not earn the best money but do the best we can) is not up to her standard, we don't visit(we live next door, not sure if it's worth mentioning she hasn't been in our place since we moved in.)

I also assume this is the reason i fall in love so quick which i find verrrrry annoying. I really want a SO but i also have a feeling that i will be mentally/physically incapable to do it. Maybe there is something about which would make it actually impossible for someone to far from me. Im also prettt ugly. The type of ugly that could become ""decend looking"" but never will. This shit really makes me loose motivation. The worst parr is that i have a feeling i wont be ready for a relationship for a while. But how long that ""while"" will take is undecided. I really would like to write a tl;dr but idk how. Thanks for reading",24Jun2019,2
75,"My Bf (22m) and I (19F) have been together for almost a year now, but weve known each other for at least 3. He knows Ive had issues in the past, but I don’t know how to talk about what Im currently going through. Ive always dealt with depression, anxiety and an eating disorder. Ive tried to commit suicide twice before (years ago), But in the past few months my depression has gotten worse and Ive become suicidal again. I also had bulimia and a general eating disorder since i was 15. Again, the past few months it has gotten worse and Ive noticed that I sometimes go more than a day without eating. When I do, it’s something small. Before anyone says anything, Yes I am medicated and have been for 2 years. I think the only reason Im scared to tell him is because I dont want him to think its his fault at all. Hes so wonderful to me and I actually feel a bit better when Im with him. I just know I cant go through this alone. Im not used to hiding anything from him and I know he would want to help me through this. 
Any advice or help, I would be extremely grateful for.

TL;DR: I have Depression, anxiety and an eating disorder. Any suggestions on how to help? How do I tell my bf how im currently doing without making him think he has any fault?",24Jun2019,1
76,"I really don't like to talk about my problems anywhere but I've been bottling this all up and I'm afraid it might get the better of me.

I'm a 17 year old student and, as simply as I can put it, I might just be having a bad week. Its not as bad as the other posts here but I just can't help myself.

I'm not that great with my academics, it was just something I could never get a grip on but I would always try to get an average score at least. My social life is average as well but my relationship to my friends is that I'm always the butt of some joke and I gotten used to it knowing they mean no harm. In come my results from the latest test a month ago, my mom and I went and picked it up and I found out I got the lowest rank among my class and on the way back home my mother berate me about my horrid habits and started crying as she shouted at me for being a disappointment. I felt horrible about it and I couldn't look at her in the eye for the next 3 days at all. I silently cried in my bedroom at night for days because of it and I'm still regretting my decisions.

As a small background, my parents have really high expectations for me, never wanting me to get low marks whatsoever and always got mad at me over small mistakes even if I really couldn't do anything about it. I grew used to it but her words would still sting me.

My friends, although I know they meant no harm, aren't really helping my condition. After they found out about my low marks, they immediately made fun of it. Usually I would ignore it and laugh along but after seeing my mother cry, I couldn't help but feel down about it.

Lately however, I feel like it's getting worse as I'm getting closer to another big test and I can't think of anything else other than how I would only disappoint my mother more. I've been cramming more and more of my studies for the past week in preparation and it's been taking a huge toll on my mental state as my fear of failing is slowly overcoming me.

I want to tell my parents about this problem but knowing them, I'm scared they would interpret it as me being useless and making excuses for my low grades. I also wanted to vent towards my friends but I don't want them to feel like it was their faults.

I just needed to tell somebody my problem, to at least remove some of the burden. Thank you.",24Jun2019,1
77,"Hi, everyone.

Around this time time last summer, I was going through an exponentially terrible time where my mental health was dragged through the mud, leaving me a shell of who I recognized. I’ve had depression for several years, but I didn’t necessarily put 2+2 together until soon after this happened.

I was driving back home from work after a very stressful day, and I was mindlessly listening to whatever music was playing on my phone. A song that I know by heart started to play, so I was humming along and waiting for the chorus. As soon as the chorus hits, the words sounded like straight up gibberish. Even though I knew the lyrics, what I was hearing sounded like a mumbled, garbled mess. Out of confusion, I switched the song and tried to process what had just happened. I thought maybe something happened to my speakers but nothing else I listened to sounded like *that*.

I started therapy about a month after this incident, and I mentioned this in passing one day. She told me it’s somewhat common for people under high levels of distress to sort of lose simultaneously lose focus on what you try to process in conversation, music, memory, etc. That gave me peace of mind, but I still have yet to find anything on the internet that sounds like what happened to me — aside from falling under the umbrella schizophrenia.

I don’t believe I have any other symptoms of schizophrenia, but would my incident be a sign of that? I genuinely have no idea what to make of it after all this time.",24Jun2019,1
78,"What I wish I could tell them: There's no need to worry. It's like worrying about a house fire. Dude, it's ashes already. It's been ashes for years. I've felt this pain for years and years, day for day, without anyone noticing. My body, my brain, my sanity, it's already burnt coal black. There wasn't a single day where I didn't want to die. I've grown up and built a personality on anxiety and self-hate that a dozen therapists can't fix. I've shut my mouth for 20 years and beyond. Yes, it didn't have to be like this. Yes, not being homophobic sexists would have helped me accept myself. Not having to hide every problem that in life I had would have helped. But now that it is what it is you can't turn back time and fix everything. Your guilt doesn't have any weight. Now you wanna do change your ways with your piece of shit religion and your intolerance? Fine. But leave me the fuck out of it.

I love my family, which is the major reason why I kept living. There's a ton of things that they didn't know, but if you tell someone what you want to hear, then it loses its meaning. It isn't honest anymore.

I've seen quite a few posts from the other side. Maybe it's not a good idea to wait for too long when you see your kid struggling, and just hope that it will pass. And yet this is what I'm seeing among relatives and acquaintances. Not all of them get depressed, but it might affect their future in other ways. The kids don't want to talk about it? Well, no shit, if everyone else keeps bottling up.",24Jun2019,1

Since then, I've continued to progress through hard work and a willingness to accept what I've experienced as well as where I need to be.

I'm now 10 months sober as of this very day. It's also the 10 month anniversary of separating from my wife. Not every day is amazing, but i'm amazed that I just keep getting better. More opportunity, more responsibility, more perspective and more acceptance.

I'm happy to be where I am today, which means I must accept every moment such has come before. If you are reading this, it gets better. I used to fantasize about being dead every day. Many times a day. Now, my therapy has dropped to once a month, i'm in alcoholics anonymous and I've been honest and thus surrounded myself with support.

81,"Month and a half ago, I accepted a job promotion. From a (not so) simple guy to a leader of cca 16 people. I am supposed to start on the first of July.

&amp;#x200B;

My current boss, the leader that is leaving, the person I am suppesed to get my training from, has become very insufferable. She has never been a good boss, she yells a lot at people for the smallest mistakes. In the past two years or so during which she has been doing this job, she has created a toxis envirnoment. There has been complaints at her, several of our people transfered to different departments, some even left the company. In the recent month, she started yelling at me more, she hasn't showed me anything about the job I am supposed to do. Every day she finds something to rub in my face - and the truth is, she is right in many of these instances.

&amp;#x200B;

Years ago I suffered from severe depression and anxieties to the point where I couldn't do anything. I couldn't even talk to my friends. I left my first job because of it and had been unemployed for over a year, during which I didn't go to a single interview. I just couldn't. Eventually, small company where my mother works hired me, thanks to her. There, after another personal event that left me broken even more, I finally got really pissed and decided to do something about it, in a good way. I started excercissing, eating better and thinking better. I stopped drinking. I lost 60 pounds, from a year long depression I got it to max 1 day per year. After many years, I finally didn't want to kill myself. It was awesome, a masive improvemnt. I got my current job in a huge international company, the plant I am in has over 1000 employees. It was a challenge for me but I wanted to improve even more. And it has been good, for the most part.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to present day. I can't fulfill the smallest task I am given. I hide from people, I spend 20-30 minutes sitting on a toilet just to save time which I would otherwise have to spend interacting with people. I even started thinking of ways to get myself fired on the spot. Including punching her. I cry at home and more.

&amp;#x200B;

On friday, there was a ton of work, and I couldn't help my coworkers because of the state I have been in for the past couple of weeks. I am deeply ashamed of that. And of course, my boss rubbed it in my face again just before I left in the afternoon and I couldn't do anything about it or say something. I just put my head down and left.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, it is not just her but also the pressure from the new job. A job I don't really want to do. Never have wanted to but I didn't know how to say no when I was approached, I was embarassed to say no. I thought I had to say yes that it was expected from me. My current job is OK and still challenging for someone like me. Even salary is great, I don't even spend all the money I get.

&amp;#x200B;

So, more than a month after I took the promotion, after all the talk with my future boss on how I will manage to do it, after all the time I have been reassuring him that I am capable, a week before I am supposed to start - I want to tell him I don't want it. The thing is, this will cause an immense trouble for our department and for him in particular and my coworkers and people around. I want to tell him but I don't want people to suffer because of me.",24Jun2019,1

It is even worse if a female account not only laugh reacts but then says something really mean or nasty. 

Also this applies the female STRANGERS. Not sure because I'm afraid of how pretty they are. If it were a female I know laugh reacting at something on facebook it doesn't effect me like how when a stranger does so. 

I cannot control what others say and they will say whatever they want. Different people have different issues.

85,"This is a long story and my head is all over the place so I’m sorry if this doesn’t make much sense. I’ll start at the beginning where I think this all started. I (F29) had a very toxic mother who I could never please. She never expressed her “motherly love” towards me and would treat me differently to her other daughters. She would give me the silent treatment for a few days at a time and only acknowledge my younger sisters and dad. One of the times this really truly hurt was when I failed my higher exams at school because I was depressed and didn’t know I was at the time. She seen me as a disappointment and a failure so she ignored me for days. She would also hit me until I was about 13/14 and that’s when the emotional and psychological abuse started. I don’t want to go into much detail as it’s still quite upsetting to think about but a couple of examples are she would constantly compare myself to my sister and her good grades. She wouldn’t allow me to socialise with friends from work (18/19 yrs old) but then tell me I needed to make friends as I was alone. I struggled with school especially the last two years there and found it difficult to make friends. If I was out with work colleagues then my mother would phone and text me all the time to see where I was and when I was coming home etc. This would be from 7pm until I agreed to come home early. I cut all contact from her 5 years ago . But the rest of the family stood by her and supported her even though I told them what my mother had done to me all these years. Even when I told my dad everything my mum would call me a liar and convince everyone that I was not to be trusted. That these accusations were just stories. 
5 years later, and I’m sitting here writing this because I needed to let it all out. My mental health isn’t great. I am taking antidepressants which I’ve been on for almost 2 years. I hate myself so much and I don’t know why. I can’t stand to look at myself, I punish myself for the way I am, how I feel or think. I hate that I have no family to talk to. My boyfriend and I argue so much these days and I think it’s because I become defensive when he takes the mick out of me or says something innocent and I “over react” and take what he says to be nasty. I know that spending 20 odd years with my Mother has caused me to be like this. To be depressed, not wanting to live anymore, I’m always anxious especially when I’m alone. I have no confidence at all and constantly question why I am still here if it hurts this much. I hate myself so so so much I can’t stop feeling like this. I know it’s not right to feel like this. All I do is apologise to everyone because I’m worried I’ve upset them or constantly feeling like everyone is against me. I don’t know what to do so thought this would be better to share with anyone who is willing to read this story. 
Thankyou Reddit.",24Jun2019,1
86,"I never had a happy childhood. I was an odd ball so to speak. Did not have kids my age growing up and in school never had many friends and no good ones. I always felt i was ""behind"" emotionally and socially. That is all in the past and behind me now, mostly. 

Recently i read a novel where i identified with the main character. That does not happen that often for me. This time i understood the characters motives, the though process, why and how he does things. In a sense it was like it was about me in a different world. Then i found out that character is on the spectrum. That made me research it. There are different tests online for it. They all say that they are not definitive and that one should speak to a professional. I did a couple of test, scoring on the lower end on the spectrum every time. Then i did them again thinking back on how i would answer as a kid. Those end up in the middle. 

At this point i dont know if i have a form of autism or im just socially awkward and using this as an excuse to justify my shortcomings and explain my shitty childhood. Both make sense.

87,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for about two years and over the months I’ve gradually begun to understand the struggle that life is for him a lot of the time. 

A bit of background information—he had something very traumatic happen during his childhood and he has diagnosed PTSD. His anxiety has been so bad—hyper-vigilance, a mind that never slows—that he has seriously considered taking his own life to escape the pain.  At one point he had a plan, but didn’t follow through. (That was before we met). 

Now he seems to be doing better. He’s been in psychotherapy for about a year and he recently saw a psychiatrist and is taking an SSRI which he says has taken his anxiety from a 7 to a 2. He puts so much work into himself and is trying so hard to overcome his demons. Still, healing is not a linear thing and sometimes I feel overwhelmed by the depth of his wounds.


As someone who has never really experienced severe anxiety or depression, I can be a good partner and advocate. However, sometimes I’m overcome with worry that someday he will be too exhausted to keep fighting this fight and take his own life. I know it seems selfish to say this, but I can’t handle these thoughts and worry about the enormous pain I’d feel if this were to happen 5, 10, 20 years down the road. I deeply want to build a life with him, have children, see our dreams through and  grow old together, but this fear and these “what if’s” are always simmering in my mind. Despite his baggage, there’s no one with whom I’d rather be. How can I change my way of thinking? I’m deeply excited to potentially marry him and build our lives together, but at the same time fearful of how mental illness might jeopardize our mutual happiness.",24Jun2019,1
88,"This is a sensitive topic.

My boyfriend and I had an intense 8month relationship that went from smooth to rocky.
At some point we were arguing every day (him starting most of the time as he was short tempered) 
I broke up with him because our relationship got toxic (we attempted to fix things multiple times but it didn’t work.) and I wanted us to work on ourselves separately for a bit to realise our wrongs.
We are together again after a month.

he didn’t open up about it but I could see the signs of depression when out of frustration he would point out that sometimes he wants everything to “end” as all his efforts don’t show results.

He often mentions about how he dislikes his job, the city he lives in and how people are fake.
I am the only one that knows his personal situation.
His family and friends think he’s fine.

I wanted us to see a psychologist,but he doesn’t support this idea.
He is also not very religious.

He is not happy with himself and I can see he has a big void within him. 
I know he is not like this and I Don’t want to leave him because I know this is the time he needs me the most. I really want to fight this with him.
As if things couldn’t get worst, his motorbike that he worked hard to buy was stolen a few days ago.

He told me he feels cursed but what he’s really trying to say is that everything is going wrong no matter how hard he tries.


I’m scared of what he could do... it’s getting hard to see him as he is staying home more. (This is not likely of him, he loves dining and staying outside)
He told me he’s not good company (which is not true and I’m trying to hang out to get his head off things)


Please give me ideas on what to do to help him out.

One of my friends was messing around round the side of a pub we went to before we went into a bar and threw an empty beer keg at a wall.
The bouncer (understandably) turned us away as he didn’t admit to it. But, my other friend, who was at the front, decided to argue with the bouncer over the decision and proceeded to become threatening to the bouncer.

We eventually left for home in embarrassment after what had happened and my friend who started the altercation with the bouncer genuinely didn’t know what he did wrong and believed everyone was ganging up on him.

99,"This might get a bit rambly but I really need advice so apologies in advance.

So at the start of the year I dated this girl for just over a month, we did a lot of shit really fast including getting really physical really quickly and talking all the time, on the phone if we couldn’t meet up in person, which we often couldn’t do as her parents are pretty overprotective. She ended things because she was having some pretty serious emotional and physical contact issues and didn’t feel like she could be in a relationship. We stopped talking for a while, but eventually started up again and are friends now, although I still have feelings for her.

While we were together she hinted that she had been abused in the past, and she has a history of bad relationships (including neglect, cheating and an attempted suicide). Her family is pretty fucked, as her mother is neurotic, controlling and emotionally manipulative and her father is depressive with anger issues. Her gran is bipolar and emotionally and physically abused her and her mother when they were younger, and is no longer in contact, but her grandfather is the biggest issue.

He sexually abused her as a child repeatedly, and after she told her parents they assumed she was lying and CONTINUED TO BRING HER TO HIM. THEY ARE STILL IN CONTACT TO THIS DAY. Her family refuses to believe her when she tells them what happened and, though the abuse has stopped, she still occasionally has to see him.

She revealed that despite the fact that she was and is very sexual, often initiating things when we where together and joking about it often with her friends, she never actually enjoys doing sexual things, and usually feels extremely vulnerable and doesn’t get off. She would get the urge to do something and then suddenly shut down emotionally and physically, or would assume the other person only wants her for sex and do it just to try and make them happy. She assumes that people only see her sexually, what with teenage boys being cunts and her friends joking about it non-stop, and her grandfather “using” her that way.

She’s got some health issues that have been fairly expensive in the past, and she is currently seeing a therapist about her issues, but her parents are extremely manipulative and often guilt her for things that are not her fault, with her mother trying to stop her from seeing her therapist because she “sees it as unnecessary” and her parents occasionally threatening to divorce or to abandon her for fairly minor things. Her parents fight constantly and do not seem to be in a good relationship, and seem to have stopped caring about her health, where her mom used to be extremely overprotective she now seems more apathetic to her issues.

She describes her emotions as being very on/off, where they either hit her extremely hard or just aren’t there for weeks or months at a time, revealing that she only consistently felt anything for the first week of our relationship, after which they would switch on for a few hours or a day at a time, and then switch off again, meanwhile she would either try to force it or just pretend everything is fine.

I really care about her and want to help but I have no idea what to do. She was very nervous about opening up to me and isn’t used to people caring about her or treating her like a human being.

I talk to him and try and not enable him of course with his delusions that the government is after him but instead give him the compassion he craves so he does not feel alone. He is a good guy but I worry about him often. So what I am wondering is this.

I have ADHD so I am no stranger to internal stuff with the imagination. I create fantasy worlds in my head for stories I write and game scripts and things of that nature. Now I do know they are not true of course and I do not see them with my eyes but instead picture everything with my mind. But for him I think he may actually see things with his eyes.

So I am trying to understand this better so I can better communicate with him and try and understand his illness. Is it that he is having a phsyical external hallucination that he sees with his eyes as if it is really there? or is this like a sort of mental vision gone rogue and he is not aware of it being fake and can't filter internal imagination from external reality?.

102,"I've struggled for years with this feeling and it makes me feel completely alone even when surrounded by friends. I have several close friends whom I love very very much, and I always feel like they don't feel the same deep love for me. I've also been told my entire life that my emotions are ""too much,"" I'm too sensitive, etc, so sometimes I wonder if that's part of it. Like my emotions are stronger/more intense than other people's, so by default my friends wouldn't love me as much. In any case it leaves me feeling extremely depressed and lonely.

105,"hi so this is actually a call out for help for my sister...

she is 13 and isn't eating. when our mum spoke to her she said that it's because she thinks she's fat and even brought up BDD. She's lost a lot of weight, which is causing her to be very lathargic and fatigued, have a very low mood and an increase in anxiety. 

the other day myself and our mum had to rush in to school to effectively scrape her semi-unconcious body off of the sports hall floor after she'd had a panic attack. 

I've suffer from flickering eating disorders myself (they come and go) and I know some of the horrendous consequences I've faced in the past for my actions caused by my EDs, and I don't want that for her. My parents are also all very very worried and the stress is really damaging the family. 

Though I have personal experience, it's never been linked to me feeling I was/am fat even though I'm not (also btw she is and always has been really tiny - not much meat on her at all even when she's perfectly healthy), so I don't feel I can help her too much because I can't relate to her feeling of being fat even when she is quite the opposite. 

Any help would be appreciated, both my myself and my sister as well as our parents.

It feels like i miss so many opportunities in life by doing this.
I also have problem talking to a group even though i enjoy it when I calm down, becuase i like to have responsibility and I get more motivated when i have it.

107,"I understand that I should take everything I read on the internet with a grain of salt. However, I am genuinely interested in the worlds opinions at this point. I am sick of living my life like this. There is something seriously wrong with me, mentally, and I do not have thousands upon thousands of dollars to throw at someone sitting in a chair. So for now, I'd like to get some ideas from the community. This post will likely jump around a lot, so I apologize for that.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Where to begin...I guess with my childhood. I grew up in a small city in Wisconsin. I have a pretty small family, just my mom, dad, sisters, grandparents, and cousins. All in all, under 20 people. My father was constantly in and out of prision for the majority of my life. My mother was a raging alcoholic, but had her good moments. From Kindergarten to freshman year in high school, I was consantly in trouble. I fought a lot. Had very few friends and I suppose I could attribute that to the fact that I switched schools every single year until high school. I'm sure that had something to do with it. No real chance to form lasting friendships. When I got to high school I saw what those life-long bonds produced. Finding my way into some of those circles was extremely difficult so I learned quickly to morph into someone who was likable. Someone who had the same interests as those around me. I did this so much that I eventually lost who I was. To this day I still have no idea who I am. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to present day, and why I am posting today...

I am 30. Married. No children. I own a home and have a steady and stable job. I have no interests/nothing interests me anymore. I have no drive to do anything. When I am around people in public (ie: going out to eat or something) I get so nervous that I start to shake. Not noticeably or anything, but I am shaking. If I hear laughter in the background in any direction I automatically and instantly think it is about me. Something is wrong with me and they are laughing. I have walked into an establishment before with my wife and immediately left because I couldn't handle the feeling of judgement. I hate my body, I feel ugly all the time. When I was younger, I used to get so mad that I would beat people up and then immediately feel terrible afterward. This feeling has followed me mentally. When laying next to my wife I often think about how easily her life could be taken. There are knives in the kitchen, an intruder could come shoot us both. And I have these thoughts about everyone close to me, and as soon as I have those thoughts I (just like when I used to beat kids up) feel extremely terrible. It is as if I find comfort in some strange way from the terrible feeling. I hope you don't get this turned around, I'd never hurt anyone today, but the thoughts of doing it enter my mind as if to trigger the terrible ones that follow. Not sure what that's about. 

&amp;#x200B;

Going back to when I was in high school, I am a pretender. I have no real personality. I automatically adapt to who I am talking to. If life brings a person in front of me and we start to talk, I listen closely for queues as to what their interests are and build my responses off of that. I want nothing more than for the conversation to be over, but I cannot simply leave a conversation for I do not want to be judged and deemed an asshole or something. I have climbed the ranks at my current job because of this trait. I am a people pleaser, and I morph/adapt however necessary to be liked and promoted. 

&amp;#x200B;

That's all I have for now, I have to take care of a few things. I will add to this post later. In the meantime though, if you have question for me that would better help you to understand me, please ask them.

108,"(18F) and I’ve been informally diagnosed with social anxiety for a couple years now. However, my new therapist has really tried breaking down my fears with me and I’ve started to suspect that separation anxiety may be the bigger problem. It’s embarrassing because I’m an adult who can’t stand to be away from family in many/most situations, not a toddler who, IMO, has every right to be fearful of everything/everyone that isn’t “mommy”. I’m already dreading certain activities that are planned for this summer because it involves me being away from family for extended periods of time. 

Does anyone have experience with adult separation anxiety? I start school in the fall and I’m scared as hell to be away from home, even thinking about school and courses puts me in distress.",24Jun2019,1
109,"I've been dealing with mental illness now for over 5 years, but the past year and a half have been a period of intense worsening of my symptoms. I am now a grad student with a wonderful, compassionate, and understanding supervisor. I love what I do but most of the time it is very hard for me to get my 35ish weekly work hours in. My supervisor is pretty relaxed about timing (as long as it gets done, he doesn't really care about the timing). My problem is that I am definitely not getting my hours in and I cannot make it up at other times at my current level of functioning. Plus I have doctor and/or therapy appointments at least once a week. 

&amp;#x200B;

My supervisor keeps telling me I'm making good progress but he doesn't really see that I'm doing the bare minimum to keep afloat in my work and home life. I want to talk to him about it, maybe it would make me feel better about things? But I find it so hard to talk about candidly and eloquently about my mental health without crying and I usually don't get my point across (it's either crying to making self-deprecating jokes, which don't go over too well with some folks). Plus if I talk to him I feel like I should be asking for something, which I'm not sure what that would be. His understanding? Pity? Etc.?

I wish she would compare the me a few years ago to the me now and realize something isn’t right. I have no support system at home. My mom has no maternal instincts and I often wonder why she even had me. She’s the only one I have here though. They wanted to keep me in a mental health hospital indefinitely but she fought against , thank god because I did not want to be there.  They have me on meds for my paranoia/anxiety, bipolar as well as anti depressants and sleeping aids etc but those are just band aids on a much bigger issue.

No one has really hung out there. My room feels so isolated and sterile like a hospital room. Frustratingly I happened to get really sick on my second day here and have been holed up in my room. I fear that while everyone’s establishing friends and going out, I’m left here alone and miss out on this important time to make friends. I’m sorry this is long and thank you for letting me rant.

Yes I could live off of it, but my parents would not like it and would insist on me staying with them, which I see as no issue.

114,"Need some guidance. I'll cut a lot of corners on the story but to put it simply; I work for my wife's uncle. He's a big-wig salesmen and he hired me in as the ""inside guy"" because my background is in IT and AutoCAD. I do all of the backend work after he makes a sale.  
 

About a year in I planned to leave as to be honest, I hate it. Sales is not in me at all. I'm a mr. fixit specifically with IT. The only thing I've ever been truly good at is fixing and deploying tech related stuff. I took this job because prior to this I was only making about 40k for my family of 4; this salary was a game changer for us at 65k.  
 

When I neared my year point where I was going to leave, I had difficulty finding a new job. Go figure. So he offered to let me stay on as I was doing a good job; which I accepted because the alternative was unemployment. We verbally agreed to me staying an additional 2 years; no formal paperwork was signed or anything like that (small business).  
 

On the surface, it's been great. I got about a 10k raise, I got to keep my job, and the owners / managers have always treated me well. This is part of my conundrum… I'm not feeling this way at ALL from the actual positon; just my inner self.   
 

This is where it gets shakey. I have mental health issues (depression) and I always have had them. I go in and out of depressions mainly strung upon what I do at work. Like I said, sales is not in me, so for whatever reason when I know someone got kinda ripped off… I dwell on it for weeks at a time. So this is the main reason I really dislike this job. Moreover, literally a week after I accepted to stay here, I got called back for a dream-IT job that I had to turn down an interview for. Over the next month after that I received 3 more calls; all of which I had to turn down.   
 

I want to leave this job as it's causing emotional issues with me. I see a therapist and they also agree that this job, and sales in general, is just not health for me. Call me weak minded; I'm ok with that. However at this point I'm still in a 1.5 year verbal agreement. Moreover it's with a family member making the situation even greasier.

A friend of mine works at an oil/gas company in Houston (where I live) and they're data center manager contacted me about an opportunity. This is very similar to the first call back I had to turn down; a DREAM job. It would change our lives regarding compensation (we could finally begin paying off debt) and moreover, it's basically THE job I went to school for, THE job I got 5 IT certifications for, and THE job I've always wanted.   
 

With 1.5 years left on our verbal agreement, my therapist saying ""leave the company"", and this opportunity at my doorstep; how unethical would it be for me to just say fuggit and leave? Again, I want to emphasize that 99% of this is brought on by my mental state. This job I work now, while the compensation/benefits are great, to me is no more than selling popsicles on the corner. I come in at 8, sell the popsicles, then at 5pm I want to forget every single thing I did that day… metaphorically speaking.  My gut is telling me to ""GTFO.""

117,"I have always suffered from anxiety and depression since childhood. It comes in waves - some periods I feel mostly fine with a general malaise, but other times I am overwhelmed with sadness or panic to the point of debilitation. 

I moved to across the country from a big city on the west coast to a rural area 40 miles outside of NYC two years ago in order to return to grad school. I got a job, got into the grad school of my dreams, and started trying to rebuild the life I had left behind.

But things quickly degraded. I'm now in the process of withdrawing from school, mostly because it's proved to be too expensive and the program I thought was my dream has had some unexpected elements that have really disillusioned me with academia/education in general. 

My job is seasonal - I teach - and since school's been out for summer, I'm very bored without anything to fill my days. I have been actively looking for a summer position or a 'side gig' to get me out of the house and generate some extra much needed income. I had a really great interview with one place a couple of weeks ago, but I just got word they chose another candidate, and that heightens my sense of failure/depression, especially after making the decision to drop out of school.

Since I've moved I'm also fairly lonely. I left behind most of my friends, and I do have close friends and family nearby, but I don't really get to see them as often as I'd like. I want to get out and make new friends, but not having a steady job means feeling guilty whenever I spend money. I find it hard to justify buying drinks/dinners out when I can save money by just enjoying them at home. I also live in a very rural area where there aren't many people my age around. As such, I'm having a very difficult time connecting with other like-minded people. In the past I've always made friends by doing activities I enjoy, through work/school, and/or becoming a regular somewhere. But working in such an isolating field, and not working in the summertime I've really had difficulty connecting with others, no matter how hard I try or how often I go out. 

I'm not overwhelmed with anxiety/depression - I am still mostly functioning, keeping up with routines, and actively trying to make things work. But I find it hard to concentrate recently. It's like I'm Eeyore and a perpetual dark cloud is always following me. I feel foggy, dark, and achy. I'm fatigued and worried. I try to get out - get sunshine and activity, go for walks and swims, but the darkness sort of follows me. It feels more like a numbness than a sadness.

I'm not sure what to do. If it were the type of depression akin to grief - where I cry all the time and can outwardly express my gloom - I could handle it, but the fact that I can't break free from these emotions is really concerning. I was seeing a therapist for a little bit earlier in the year, but my insurance only covered 8 sessions, and I disliked her immensely, as she was younger than me and a little condescending/judgmental about my situation. I'd like to see a life coach, as I've never tried it before and I've heard there's more pro-active elements - exercises and activities patients can complete that put them in control - as opposed to therapy, where I feel really whiny and unmotivated because I'm a little bit older now and understand the triggers and origin of my mental health problems.

But without insurance, or any steady employment, I can't really afford it right now. I just feel really hopeless, and would like some sympathy/comfort/advice regarding getting through this difficult period of time rn.",24Jun2019,1

My father took me on the four wheeler into the woods to show me a “tree house” he had made for me. I remember it. I remember thinking it was weird, but what does a 5 year old know about anything? How was I supposed to know it wasn’t right? He was my FATHER. It was there, in the back of my mind, constantly being pushed down. Until I was 14, and I went to visit him. He commented on my growing body all day long, and before bed he came into my room and brought up that day when I was 5. Everyone thinks they want to know WHY someone did what they did, but do they really want to know? “You climbed up the ladder and your underwear was sticking out of your shorts. And I just wanted it.” Five years old, now 10 years later, asking to, “feel you while I jack off”. My sister texted me that night, and he got up and left the bedroom. She has no idea that she may have saved me from something horrible. Now 8 years later, in the middle of day, getting lunch, doing laundry, listening to music, it will pop into my head, “and I just wanted it.” “Feel you..” it doesn’t get easier.

Somewhat cross posted in r/bipolar. About 2 years ago, after numerous depression meds that didn't work,  I saw a psychiatrist that did an analysis that said bipolar 2. Now I have felt better to an extent, even to the point if finally starting community college instead of saying its implausible. 

That said, my life has evened out. I got out of a pretty bad relationship about a year ago. She was pretty physically/mentally abusive, but honestly I still cry and miss her, and by cry I mean i just did this morning. This is a good thing as before her, I had 2 relationships that lasted 4 years each that I never cried about or even really cared when they ended. In fact from around age 12 I never cried about anything. Relationships, step brother and roommates suicides, grandparents deaths. So crying and feeling that emotion is calming.

Now the problem is still daily. Although never to the extreme, my mood changes constantly. Not daily. Not hourly. Almost in intervals of 10, 20, 30 minutes what have you. I am typically a little anxious but normally calm, but usually a more negative mood. Sometimes I get frustrated or very anxious randomly (sense of impending dread for no reason, but not panic attacks), to awesome bouts of almost mania feelings of happiness. They come and go as things happen throughout the day. I've always been kinda wierd, awkward whatever, but I'm trying to find out why, and why my mood changes like this. The mental abuse of my ex also has made me very weak mentally. I have a date from tinder tonight and though I will go, i am already subconsciously ready for her to dismiss me. Also, I occassionally think I would feel better off meds, but then I think back to how I am in school and doing better.

126,"I’ve been going through a pretty rough low point lately. I lost my bartending job, and it’s the slow season where I live, so there aren’t any jobs opening up. I’m not sure how I’m going to pay rent, and to top it all off I cut the tip of my finger off and don’t have health insurance. I was prescribed painkillers and before I even notice that my finger was no longer throbbing I noticed this complete lack of anxiety, and that I wasn’t drowning myself in worry over my current situation. I didn’t feel medicated, I just felt calm and rational. I reworked my resume and started sending it to restaurants and bars on the off chance that one is hiring. 

Six hours later like my prescription said, I took another pill. The pain in my finger subsided and I cleaned my apartment after months of being unable to bring myself to do it. I unpacked the boxes that have been sitting in my kitchen for eight months. 

I think I’m going to give my boyfriend the pills and have him hide them from me. I watched my brother struggle for years with addiction and I know that’s the last thing I need. But I already miss not having that weight of anxiety hold me down, I realized that this constant tight feeling in my chest isn’t normal. I don’t know how else to get that.",24Jun2019,1

The point is-I do not feel like i hate dating. I found myself extremely stress out and even nauseous when someone ask me out or cuddling me but I DO WANT to start a relationship and I don’t want to be lonely. I’m afraid that everyone will get tired with me either.

No noticeable benefits either. Before this I was on sertraline 150mg and nothing from that either. I'm going up to 40mg in 2 weeks. Has anyone any experience with this medication, or have noticed a difference when increasing the dose? I stopped work 5 weeks ago after 7 years because of anxiety, and am in the process of claiming a benefit. I don't intend on finding a job again until I feel better because its all so stressful. Did your medication have a big noticeable effect or did you have to look for it? I just want to get better and have been having counselling for 3 years, but am desperate so get my old self back which is why Ive started medication as well. I'm still nervous to go to the shop, go for a walk, go out to eat, answer the door, answer the phone, cross roads, get a haircut, take my dog for a walk, hang the washing out etc. I've been doing this stuff for a long time and these things still stress me out.

129,"I guess you could say I've been through a bit in my life. My fair share of ups and downs. From the age of 16-23 I had an anxiety disorder and would have nervous breakdowns from time to time while being medicated throughout the majority of that time. 

Although I had problems I was always a pretty talkative person and enjoyed meeting new people. 

In the last year I have been off medication and I have found a way to find inner peace (Sony ask me how), I guess you can say I learnt to accept anxiety and not fight it. 

What I have noticed recently is that I have become a more quiet person. I take my time when responding and sometimes I do not talk much at all, even when I am with friends. 

I am very happy though and I thrive when all is quiet and tranquil. People tend to tire me out much easier these days. 

A few days ago I was pretty exhausted and was tired to the point where It was hard for me to speak. Like I literally couldnt get my words out, felt like a mash in my head. 

Anyway I am now a very happy person, this only happens when Im under a little stress. Im now 25.

Anyway I would appreciate if anyone would like to share their stories of becomming quieter? Is this normal? And have you found your inner quiet yet?

130,"I'm not going to go into the exact details that are occurring, but I'm hoping you will be able to still give some advice since I'm really not well versed in this kind of thing. One of my friends is currently going through a manic episode that is causing them to have delusions.  From the medical side my friend is fully supported by doctors and family, medication etc, it's just that they need time to take effect. 

Now my question comes in around the delusions they are having. My friend talks about them constantly and although they have some awareness that they are not currently themselves, they have complete and total belief in the delusions they have created. When my friend talks to me about these delusions I really don't know what to do. I want to support them so up until now I have just been there to listen, but I'm now worried that simply listening is reinforcing the belief that they are real because no one is actively calling out the delusions. To my friend, this has meant that everyone is on their side and believes everything they're saying. I'm concerned that if we continue to do this it will reinforce the delusions so that even after this episode is over my friend will still believe the delusions are real, and I'm worried about the repercussions of that. I want to do what is best for my friend, I just don't know what that is, so any advice or resources would be helpful. Thanks in advance (Ont., Canada)",24Jun2019,1

132,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

Let me start by sharing my story:

I am 22 years old and in 2 days I am marrying my best friend who is also the love of my life (we have been together for 8 years). I have been diagnosed with reactive depression and I'm going through a pretty tough time right now.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been seeing a therapist and she is very helpful. We have discussed what I believe caused my depression:

I. Last year **my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer**. She battled it and won but I never really processed her illness. For around 5-6 months I shut myself off emotionally.

II. For the past 2 years I have **battled asthma**, trying to improve my lung capacity so that I could join the armed forces which has always been my dream since I was very little. My father, grandfather, great grandfather etc were all soldiers and it had always been something I wanted to do. My asthma was getting worse but I tried to ignore (which was extremely stressful) it until I ended up in hospital and going back on inhalers which meant any aspirations of joining the army were over. This really crushed me.

III. I left university with an **engineering degree** and started working at a job I hated. I only worked there because I was engaged and felt the need to start saving up money for when I was married. This was a really stressful experience as the job was making my asthma worse.

IV. I grew up in an **impoverished area** and my family never had a lot of money. Throughout school I worked very hard putting myself under a lot of pressure to do well so I could escape my background. I only did an engineering degree because I thought I would make lots of money and get out of my poor area and then become happy as a result. I never enjoyed my degree and it was extremely hard. 

V. I have a lot **childhood trauma** from when I was 6-7 years old. My dad's uncle was tragically killed by two drunk drivers and my dad became very depressed. He would drink a lot and cause a lot of disturbance at home at night. This would really scare me and my way of escaping it was trying to sleep. Nowadays when I'm faced with a situation where I cant get to sleep it really makes anxious. 

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially in the past 2-3 years I have lived my life in a pressure cooker so to speak. I have put myself under immense stress and about 8 weeks ago I had a breakdown. Myself and my fiancé were staying at a hotel, I began to have a massive panic attack and we had to leave the hotel and go home. Since then I have felt extremely low and very anxious over the smallest things. The idea of my wedding makes me terrified. The idea of moving out of my home also scares me. I feel like life is moving faster than I'm ready for and I just want my mental health to improve.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no appetite, I find it hard to relax, I've stopped socialising and I've lost enjoyment in nearly all aspects of life.

Can anyone give me any advice on **how I can start putting my life together again?** I love my partner and I want to be a good husband to her. I feel like I am a burden on her right now and I don't want to go into my marriage depressed and anxious all the time. Cheers guys.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: 

Getting married in 2 days to an amazing woman. Suffering with reactive depression and extreme anxiety. Under lots of life stress because mum had cancer, asthma stopped me from dream job which was the armed forces, did degree and job I hated to save up for marriage, grew up poor and put myself under immense pressure to do well at school, have childhood trauma that flares up my anxiety when I cant sleep.

I have stopped enjoying life and want to improve my mental health so I can be a good husband and start living again. Need advice. Cheers.",24Jun2019,3
133,"ok not really an essay but i cannot for the life of me write a serious title, so.

to put it simply, emotions are really difficult, and something about my mental state etc makes them even more difficult at times, especially when it comes to romance. just to be entirely clear, i'm bisexual and a pretty typical hopeless-romantic kinda guy, so it's a little strange to me, because whatever's messing with my emotions (still not clear on that one currently) makes me basically have 2 modes: devotedly adoring/caring or completely apathetic. there's a middle-ground, but it's rare. it's like i can be utterly in love with someone one second and not care about them the next, it's a little concerning.

i'm mainly just wondering if anyone else has similar problems? if it's relevant at all, i have a kind of involuntary routine of being completely happy and fine for weeks and then very suddenly being straight-up self-loathing and suicidal. it's a little scary.

I won’t act out or anything.

135,"I really don't know where to begin but I am in a living hell. I've been diagnosed by several psychiatrists with OCD focusing on harm thoughts for the last 10 years. Over that time I've gone from relapse to relapse, usually once a year lasting months.

At present I am getting strong urges to act on my thoughts. As if I am being magnetically pulled toward the act. It is making me very suicidal as I know the consequences and to be honest I'm not sure I can live with/like this anymore. My mind is utterly tortured. I am anxious all the time, just not able to relax or enjoy anything from life. My girlfriend can't cope with me anymore, my family are exasperated. Can anyone relate to this in OCD?

137,"I have been struggling with this question for while and i don't really know how to move on.

I just feel bored and empty and unless i have something to obsess about, i just feel like there is no meaning to life. I just don't know what my purpose is on this earth and i don't understand why everyday i wake up and do stuff and some times while obsessing over an activity, i just feel so tired but somehow i feel like this thing/activity im obsessing over will change everything. And i will happy and satisfied with life. When im in school, i also just obsessively study and no matter how i try to convince myself, everytime i do something not beneficial to my school work/future i just quickly lose my motivation to do that activity. Then this makes me question again,  why am i even working for my future because idk whats the point.

Panic attacks, shivering despite not being cold, teeth rattling, cold sweats, stomach problems, being spaced out, needing a chaperon to leave the house, not being able to drive alone, impending sense of doom, suicidal thoughts, secluding yourself from friends and family, self-loathing, trouble going through house chores...and the list goes on. These are just a few things you experience if you live or used to live with GAD. Never in a million years that I imagined this could be me...

&amp;#x200B;

Homeless twice in my life, once with my dad when I was 2 years old after my mother threw us out, second time was when I was 14. Had to go live with my mother (father was jailed), this was a challenge since she never had me growing up, and it was a decision made by the judge since she was financially and physically able to care for me. Came home from work one night (worked part time as requested by mother) and found my stuff in garbage bags, doors locked and lights out. This is pretty much all I remember, the years that followed are one big blur. Then I got into a toxic long term relationship, boyfriend that would spend his money everywhere except for bills, forced me to work full time while attending college, full time (threatened to kick me out if I didn't find a full time job)...he was emotionally and financially abusive, took me 4 years to leave, and I still hate myself for being so easily manipulated.

&amp;#x200B;

This is just a tiny glimpse of the mental and emotional baggage I tow daily, it's exhausting, well, was exhausting. Few months back I snapped and decided to get help. I missed my old self and wanted more than anything to feel normal again, if even possible. So I went to the ER and after a few evaluations I was diagnosed with GAD and severe depression. They gave me medication, which quite honestly, didn't want to take at first (watched one too many docs about big pharma). First weeks were horrible, side effects were intolerable (later found out via my doctor they started me off on 4x the recommended dose) but after continuing with the medication and giving it time...magic happened. Last week marked my two months taking Lexapro 10 mg. 

&amp;#x200B;

***I can now manage to...***

*do laundry daily*

*go grocery shopping alone, and I enjoy it.* 

*clean the house regularly*

*eat breakfast and cook dinner* 

*shower, even twice a day sometimes (sounds like not much, but if you know, you know)*

*wake up actually rested*

*do my hair and makeup every morning (again, not much but...)*

*eat better foods (never craved fresh produce so much)*

*make time for friends and family*

*feel accomplished instead of guilty when leaving work*

*make appointments and go to them without losing sleep over it*

*feel less overwhelmed when faced with uncertainty*

*pick up new hobbies (or retake old ones)*

***and so much more....***

&amp;#x200B;

Lexapro gave me back my old self, and I've missed her dearly. Although I know there are still bad days to come, they will be faced with determination. I refuse to go back to my old, shivering, teeth rattling, scared to death self. Now that I remember how it is to feel ""normal"", I will hang on to that feeling no matter how bad my day will be. Anxiety is only crippling if you let it become, never will I let it control me again. If you'd asked me three years ago what I thought about anxiety, I would've probably said something like ""meh, we all gotta deal with it, so why should I need help?""

Turns out, we don't ""gotta deal with it"" and we're not supposed to. No matter how lost you may feel there is help out there that will make you feel whole again, and I wish I got it way sooner. Feels good man, being happy again. Feels quite fucking amazing...

It has been a year of me being completely out of energy. I get tired of people really fast, and i am unable to concentrate on things (I had to drop medical university because of that). I have no money to go to the doctor and I am too afraid to ask my father for money because he thinks that therapy (psychologists?) are useless. And the only thing that keeps me from fulfilling the thought of killing myself is that i don't want to upset my relatives. 
My mother died 14 years ago, when i was 6, and even though i think i got over it i guess i never actually did. It left me with a fear (or a constant thought?) of my relatives dying. I am afraid that my grandmother, aunt or father will die, since they are not that young (father and aunt in their fifties, grandmother about 80). Moving out also scares me because when I am at home I still feel like some sort of a child, and moving out will mean that I am actually alone.

So recently I’ve been doing quite well past few weeks but on Saturday I was waiting on my girlfriend coming out of the shops and just my head started to wonder and I started questioning things like, what if my girlfriend doesn’t love me, what if she harms me when I’m sleeping or what if she does something to my food and every time I think of this it just gives me horrible anxiety and I’ll be honest I don’t think she’d ever do anything like that to me. Why though?? Why is OCD so hard sometimes and other times I’m absolutely fine? Is this OCD do you get horrible thoughts that cause you intense anxiety because I always worry about schizophrenia because my grans younger brother has it, is anyone else on the same boat or am I honestly going psychotic?

Also I wonder like ohh don’t touch that or look at that I case something bad happens when you do it and also I’m questioning everything like for depersonalisation I’m always saying to myself I know where I am, I know my name and I know I’m going to be ok?

149,"I get that this has been an opinion, and maybe even a fact for a long time. But, Facebook really fucking sucks. It never really bothered me till recently, maybe because I'm entering a new chapter in my life.  

I work my ass off, just got let go after gambling and accepting a job that's too good to be true, didn't make the money I was promised, but I will admit, I struggled greatly with the job. However, I give myself at least some credit for trying. Back to square one. Since this happened, social media has been really insufferable. 

Recently: I login to Facebook, thinking it'll be different this time, but it's not and i should know that it wont be. Most of it is people I don't know anymore (obviously no offense to them), a portion is people I don't like. Maybe seeing those folks thrive is making me a little jealous. I understand that is a personal obstacle i need to overcome. I really shouldn't care, but when people treat you like shit, you see them get even more ahead, it fucking sucks. 

I'd actually say a very small portion are my friends that have my phone number. I always say, ""gee, maybe I'll keep it to just say hello to people that moved, grew apart or whatever.""  But reality is that everyone's so busy, that maybe they don't want to give you the time of day. 

I have tried the ole ""hey so-n-so, been a minute, how's life treating you?"" Only to get left on read. Like... I guess I didn't really say anything worthy, but also what else am I supposed to start with when I haven't someone in a good amount of time? Start slow, show interest and uhh OH, have a small conversation is my mentality when I contact someone I haven't seen in a while. 

The thing that really pisses me off the most is everyone's pda. Like... Stop... I don't really want to see how well your relationship is going. I try, i put myself out there, but certain people have really struggle with that. I ain't no ""nice guy, incel, or entitled pos,"" if I get rejected I'm as understanding as possible. I totally understand no one owes me shit. All im saying is that it would be great if i could just fucking do that right too. Everyone wants to be loved, especially when you feel a bond. Don't say you don't because you're lying to yourself. 

I guess what Im trying to say is that Facebook makes you feel bad about where you are, because it really shows that no matter how hard you try, they're always someone better. That's really not the best thing to be reminded of so constantly. I get you have to know and assume that so you get motivated, but you don't fucking need someone always showing you how much futher ahead, successful and happier they are than you. You dont have to be like ""look at this person I'm with and you're not. I just started X job and you didn't."" That's when it makes people feel like shit, wonder why they can't get there, and why they don't deserve to move up.  A lot of times when I see that I think well, ""gee, what the hell did/didn't I do to not deserve this life event?"" I won't shun, or take anything away from that person, it just sucks seeing that they did it and I couldn't. When i fail, I don't need a participation trophy. But I sure as hell don't want to see people bragging about what I failed at. No one needs that. 

I'm not saying this affects me constantly. I'm saying I'm really starting to realize where all these newfound mental health issues are coming from over the past 15 or so years. It's all the bragging. It creates envy, even if people can't admit that. It creates a whole new set of confidence issues because of the lack of modesty people have.

150,"So, I am a cancer survivor....and I was a member of a support group that encouraged me to self-talk to help out my loneliness and sadness from being sick. It worked and really helped...but now I can NOT stop! I am constantly talking out-loud to myself...sometimes more than others...but especially when I am angry! I am working on my anger and temper but I just can't shut up sometimes! I'm so raw about my parents, feeling that I have to do everything myself and not getting the appropriate help from them, regarding things that are important to me! I have a unique situation: I'm now in Medical school!!! It is my dream...never thought I would make it...and now have to be at home with them to study for my STEP exam bc it is cheaper and easier to just stay here. Now...thing brings back LOTS of bad memories and previous angers that I did not resolve...and honestly, don't have time to now since my primary objective is studying...CONSTATLY!!! This type of career requires that I take massively difficult exams on material that takes a long time to understand, so I have put my previous issues on the back burner! But...I'm feeling the effects of those previous issues clashing with my current stress levels and feel like I'm going insane!!!! (for lack of a better term). Part of my support group, like I said was the self-talk, and now that I have this new school stress, I find myself constantly chatting...epecially when I am alone! I hate it!!!! I have tried so much to stop, but it just is not working! How can I do this without killing my Med school dream? This method really helped for a while when recovering but now I feel like it's back-firing and making me seem totally nuts!!! It is very distracting! I do not have a mental illness...I am an intense person, in regards to talking kind of loud, and fast sometimes, or moving fast...but everyone in my family is like this and I DO NOT believe it is pathological! It is just how we all are...and we should be ok with that! Not everyone is the same...and I refuse to conform to anyone's standards: bc I believe I am a good person and want to do good things with my life!!!

159,"I have seen two different therapists / counselors that operate out of the same clinic. I switched from the first to the second because I felt I wasn't making progress. Now i'm finding the second therapist has the same exact methods.

I can only call it a ""motivational speaker"" type mentality. Telling me to put positive affirmations on the mirror, ""look for the good things in your day"", ""make a list of things you like when you're sad"", etc. I understand these are probably valid and helpful techniques for some people but for me, its been extremely unhelpful. It hasn't addressed my issues with PTSD, disassociation, or anything else. Infact, the times i've tried to bring up ""darker"" things regarding my past or my mental state, they're responded to with the same kind of motivational speaker counseling.

After switching therapists to find she conducts her therapy the same way the first one did, i'm starting to get really frustrated and feeling like I don't want to go back.

Is this a specific type of therapy / counseling? How would I go about finding a therapist or counselor that is less.. ""live, life, love""-esque?

Also I have spoken with both of them regarding how I think their methods do not help me. They both said they understood but essentially conducted the same kind of therapy.",24Jun2019,1

161,"This is going to be a bit ranty and negative, so if you're easily offended do not read this. Also keep in mind that I am generalising here.

Well, basically, I'm diagnosed Bipolar I and I have next to no patience for people with BPD. I'd love to be able to have more empathy and sympathy for other people with mental disorders, but frankly the many people I've met with BPD have drained the nice right out of me.

I've come to this conclusion through a mixture of personal experience and being in bipolar support groups online - where many of the people have comorbid BPD (often, in my opinion, they're misdiagnosed bipolar).

From personal experience, I was friends with many people with it due to my time in psychiatric hospitals. They seemed very nice at first, but all of them soon proved themselves to be almost narcissistic, manipulative, deceitful, attention-seeking, evil borderline psychopaths.

I don't want to go into too much detail as I don't want to be an asshole and a lot of it is very personal.

One of them made my life an absolute misery for months on end. She made me feel dependent on her as she knew that she was my only friend in the immediate area. I met her in hospital and she seemed like the nicest person I'd ever met. In hospital and for the first few weeks after we both got discharged, she made me feel like such a special person - I loved her and I'd never met someone with so much love and devotion for me. She did everything in her power to lure me into her trap - it worked. She then got too comfortable with me and started telling my mother everything she knew about me (she got my mum's number), including things I'd rather my mother didn't know. I warned her about this but eventually just let it go. It eventually escalated into her making countless suicide threats to me - some in front of me (often with a smirk on her face) and some over the phone. She even phoned my mother in the middle of the night to tell her she was going to overdose. I had to call the police on her countless times. She made two rape accusations against two different men in the short time I knew her. In short, she was a lovely person until she got bored (which happened a lot). We had an argument and the toxic friendship ended.

Another one had less of the attention-seeking crap, but found a way to make you feel like crap. She would manipulate you into doing things by making you feel really guilty. She lied so much - she'd even deny things that happened 2 minutes ago in order to get what she wanted. She would regularly belittle me and make me feel stupid. She used me and only wanted to see me when she had no one else. She visited me in hospital all the time before my discharge in order to gain my friendship. I always thought it was out of niceness, but looking back she seemed more interested in talking to the other patients and being in the ward (she seemed to love it in there). Due to the way I felt she stood by me in hospital, I put up with her nonsense. The attention-seeking behaviours were there but very subtle - she'd never make any effort to cover up her self-harm scars and would talk about self-harming and suicide a lot. She never made a threat to me, but she did show me her stockpiled medication, with a smirk on her face, that she ""was going to overdose on it if I feel like it"". I eventually ended the toxic friendship after about a year.

Another one was just flat out evil to me. She was a friend of the first girl and she'd regularly phone up the first girl screaming and crying if I said something she didn't like. We got into an argument once, she threatened to kill me and contacted one of my close friends (who lives quite far away) and started asking if he wanted to know my 'dirty secrets'. I eventually blocked her and it solved the problem.

I've had many dealings with more people with BPD - online and from hospital, and their behaviours were similar (although less intense as I didn't know them so well). This includes deliberately showing off fresh cuts, talking about overdosing all the time, making suicide threats to other people, refusing to pay back money I loaned them (she blocked me when I asked for it back), being flat out evil to other patients in hospital etc.

It also really pisses me off when they try to liken their illness to bipolar and even pretend to have bipolar (seen it many times).

What I really don't get is how people with BPD get so much sympathy when they do really horrible things. Everything gets blamed on their BPD. Why not apply the same logic to someone with ASPD - it's in cluster B too and shares many similarities! They share many traits, such as: manipulation, deception, antisocial behaviour etc. A psychopath being evil gets no sympathy, but someone with BPD gets told ""it's a shame because you had trauma as a kid"". I fail to see how trauma is an excuse or justification to treat people like crap in adulthood. I don't buy it when people say ""they're not in control of their actions"". Should we argue that psychopaths aren't in control of their actions when they commit a crime? A psychopath is evil, but someone with BPD isn't evil when they do evil things?

BPD is literally someone's awful personality made into a medical condition. They do not suffer from a chemical imbalance in their brain that causes them to lost control like in bipolar. 

People don't ever seem to think about the people who are victim to people with BPD's stunts. They only seem to think of the poor ""mentally ill"" BPD person.

Agree or disagree?

162,"So I’m having an issue.  I accept people for who they are even if I have strong disagreements with them over political opinions and lifestyle choice.  I have a few friends that I would consider very controversial in the way they think and conduct themselves.  So much so that I have certain friends that would probably clash pretty harshly with each other if they ever met.  The problem comes in since what I want to do in life, directing movies, is a group effort.  And those people would like very much to help on my productions.  However I know putting my friends together would inevitably result in tons of problems.  I love all of these people and they care about me deeply.  And due to principle, I would not feel very great with myself if I excluded them.  

I’m probably catastrophising or whatever you call it, but this could mess up my personal life pretty bad and my credibility isn’t that great.

I am currently having a really hard time. I got rejected about 14 times by girls last week, and I do not even know anymore what to do.

So to begin the story, I was on a lot of parties last week. Because I am currently 21 and still had no girlfriend, I thought it would be a great chance to meet a girl. I found one and cared for her when she passed out. Later she told me to ""f\*\*\* off"" because ""I am a creep"". The next party I went to I finally had success, I found a girl and we kissed... till her friends pulled her away and screamed ""Eww not him"". She ignored me for the rest of the day. 

At this point, I was just finished with my life and didn't give a f\*\*\* anymore. Therefore I tried to talk to some more girls over the week. I always got rejected with disgust. I do not know anymore what to do.

You couldn't keep up, you were falling down.

When are you gonna let me know if you give a damn about me?
Don't tell me because I know what's real.
Sometimes quiet is violent.

Gave my heart to a gun, why you lovin' so reckless?
I still need you, but what good is that gonna do?
99 problems but you ain't one.

169,"Not sure I’m on the right sub.

My mental health the last year hasn’t been the best, and it made a lot of tasks seem impossible. Including how to tackle my family.

My grandfather and aunt are VERY invested in how I’m doing, to the point where they call me so fucking often and ask me out about what I’m going to do now, etc etc. Telling me about this new job advert, when they know I’m on a sick leave because of my mental health. I’ve been so stressed out about it. If I don’t reply right away, they’ll keep reaching out. They just don’t stop.

It just seems way to unbearable to confront them, and say they should tone it down a bit. Cause I know they do it out of love. And I feel so guilty for not just appreciating it.

I’ve had my mom ask them to tone it down, which has helped in some ways, but not all. And I feel like such a child for not being able to say it myself. And it made me feel even more guilty, knowing they were told to basically leave me alone.

I just don’t know how to get rid of this guilt? And how to move forward from this. It’s been going on for a year, I can’t keep on having my mom do these confrontations but I also don’t feel like I’m in any condition to tell them myself. I just really don’t want to hurt them.",24Jun2019,1

171,"Context: I'm 23 (F). My Grandfather died last year and my idiot brain decided its only valid coping strategy was to develop Anorexia Nervosa, on top of what was already severe General Anxiety Disorder, in order to cope. Cue the rapid unraveling of a rather successful little life: I've had to quit my job, quit my apartment, and return home, and I've been on the waiting list for Eating Disorder out-patient therapy since March. It was insidious and sneaky and before I knew what was happening it had swallowed my life. 

In April I was given an ultimatum by the assessment therapist: gain weight, or risk being hospitalized as an In-Patient *and* kicked to the back of the queue for funding (meaning an even longer wait). With this in mind, and terrified of abandonment, I've managed some degree of quasi-recovery, albeit only in the slow, agonizing regaining of weight while I waited. 

This week I was told I finally have a therapy slot, due for two weeks time, and my brain is now in full-on panic relapse mode. I'm so desperately certain that I've gained *too much* weight. Too much weight to been taken seriously, to 'warrant' professional help. That they'll take one look at me then gently-but-firmly shove me out the door. Every meal means agony and severe panic attacks. I can't eat in front of people. I can't look at myself in the mirror. I can't stand anything to do with food or the thought of eating, but I'm so scared my weight gain in recent months is going to leave me abandoned and alone because I'm no longer physically 'sick' enough. 

Right now my brain wants me to lose as much weight as possible in the two weeks I have left. It tells me I've done it before, and I know how to do it again. I've spent the last two hours in a screaming, crying panic attack and I'm too terrified and ashamed to tell anyone in my family about it. I already hate the burden I am and hate the burden I've been to them in this awful time.

I know it's just AN trying to sneak back in. I know I'm not even fully weight restored. But oh god, everything hurts. I'm so scared and desperate and in pain. I want to hurt myself and I've nowhere I can go or do. I already feel disgusting and unlovable and here we are, shoveling on even more proof.

I don't really even know what this post is for. But something to jolt me back into the real world would be greatly appreciated. Just someone to knock my perspective back into place. I feel so alone and hopeless.",24Jun2019,1

I’m so scared to see any of my family because or my weight gain . The thing is im either sad or mad all the time I don’t even have the motivation to go to the gym . Since I don’t have any friends I can’t talk to anyone about anything .

I’m also stuck working a 9-5 as a bank teller for the worst bank in America , all I do is sit on my ass all day indoors behind a window, fake smiling at rude customers all day .

173,"Sorry if this isnt the right place to post to, and i will remove if its not.
My brother passed away about 10 months ago from a drug overdose. He and I were very close, and my significant other ended up leaving me shortly after citing it was taking to long to get over it. We had been together for several years and considering marriage. I understand the breakup was probably a bullet dodged, however, it does not change the fact I loved her. Back to my brother, I spent the first 4 months after he died locked in my room playing video games trying to avoid dealing with grief, eventually realized it wasnt helping or healthy, and then she left (which may or may not be because of my inability to cope)  This kinda helped shove all the progress i had made back down the toilet. Ive adjusted my eating habits to be more healthy, got a gym membership, and tried to cut back on the video games. Unfortunately, I cannot find any motivation to cook, workout, or speak to other people (in general or intimately). My body aches all the time and ive begun to feel sick constantly. 

All in all, i understand grief is normal and in this situation depression would be normal, but all the research in the world doesnt really help, as it seems common sense. However, this is my first real stint with depression and im not sure if going to the doctor for pills is helpful or leads to dependecy. However i dont want to be sad all the time and im tired of not enjoying literally anything. From sex to video games to hobbies to work, i enjoy nothing now. Im not sure what to do and i feel stuck. I try to do things like workout but it takes my body forever to heal back up. 

Any advise or knowledge? I know time heals and whatnot, but i dont want to start drowning before i realize i shouldve learned to swim, as i may be in this situation. And maybe if depression would influence my immune system or make me feel sick and achy?

My dad calls me names and doesn't treat me like an equal, I feel like my friends are slowly seperating themselves from me, and I lost the ability to properly trust people nearly five years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if calling CPS will help. I don't think it will. I was manipulated in fifth grade and treated like a piece of shit. I hate how I look, how I talk, how I think. My sense of comedy is horrible, I'm always asking myself if I'm manipulative and toxic, and am always worried people are talking about me behind my back. I'd kill for a hug, any sort of irl affection, I'd kill to someone to just hold me and say that everything will be alright, or to see who I want to be in the mirror. My grades are terrible. My anxiety and depression just keep getting worse. Please, what should I do?",24Jun2019,1
183,"I don't know what is wrong with me. Today I woke up feeling really down which is normal for me on many days. My parents wanted me to do yard work, so i did, and after I was done, my parents asked for something more, and I don't know, I had some sort of mental breakdown. My parents got mad at me and were telling me that I'm lazy and were threatening to kick me out and beat me. I ended up feeling lots of anger and sadness and I started hitting myself and broke my glasses and threw things. I also hit my desk and cut into it with a knife. I have never done anything like this and I'm scared. I couldn't stop crying and almost couldn't control myself.  I was thinking of seriously hurting or killing myself. I managed to calm down now but I'm scared for my own health. 

 I want to get help but my parents won't let me and I am home schooled so I can't talk to a counselor. I also don't have any friends and I live far from town. Is there anyway I can get help? I'm 17 and don't have my drivers license yet. So I can't drive myself anywhere or work. I also can't walk because I live far away. I just don't know what to do. I honestly want to just end my life.

186,"I have been on and off with my ex for over 3 years now. Our relationship is clearly very complicated but we always found a way back to each other. He ended the relationship last weekend and I’m completely devastated. I honestly thought the problems we were going through were fixable, however he did not want to try. I know he cares about me but he says this time it is over. For the sake of maintaining our identities, I will explain one incident after the breakup as short and concise as I can. A few days after the breakup I saw something on social media that made me very upset. I lashed out on my ex very badly. I felt betrayed. Days later I admitted to being wrong but now ex really wants nothing to do with me. This is hard because I know he means it this time. I’m having a hard time letting go because all of the previous break ups I felt this pull and connection to him still, and he obviously did too. He was always the one to initiate contact with me to reconcile. I know the easy answer is that it clearly didn’t work for a reason, but I love him. During our break ups I did try and see other guys but nobody compares to my ex on so many different aspects. He is exactly what I want in a guy and I know the traits he has are rare to find especially at my age. Please any advice I’m heartbroken. It feels like I’m living a nightmare. I feel worthless and empty. Everyone just tells me not to waste my tears on him. I feel like I want to die. Someone please help.",24Jun2019,1
187,"Hi all I am desperate for advice I have had a mental illness all my life.  Just recently in 2009 I was diagnosed with conversion disorder and schitzaphrenia.  From then on my health has had a downward spiral.  I have walked out on my partner 4 times as I get in my head that I have to do that.  I saw mental health last year as I was concerned about my health and they took me off my abilify I was on 30mg a day as they looked at me and said I were not schitzaphrenia as I dressed well and told me to get over it.  Then this year I saw them again and they said after seeing me for 2mins that I had autism and was very immature.  My symptoms are now leg spasms when resting,  lack of emotion,  very talkative,  getting very angry when someone is talking to me,  zoning out, no intimacy,  frequent headaches,  hearing voices not there,  have to be prompted to do daily tasks,  no money skills. Etc.  I am at a loss I saw a psychologist they tried cbt but during trying to do meditation everything was blank.  So after all what is happening with me I am seeking a second opinion with a neuropsycologist.  So we will see what will happen.  My mental health is deteriating.

I’ve been dissociating for hours/days at a time. I struggle to find a sense of self, and question who I even am. I look in the mirror and can’t recognize myself. I feel like my body is not my own and that I’m almost living in a movie, watching the world pass in slow motion, totally detached from my body. I sit and stare for long periods of time and finally realize that I’m not thinking of anything. I’m just blank up there. Some days I’m terrified that I’m never going to “pop out” of this daze, and that I’ll never remember who I truly am.

193,"Maybe this is just for me, to get my thoughts down. I have never stopped and thought about this thoroughly until now, it will probably just be a list of where I feel different from other people, anyway, here it is.

I have never sought another person out for emotional support/discussion. I don't feel lonely, even when I am alone. The relationships I have had have been superficial and always instigated by the other person. I struggle to condemn evil. I don't totally grasp the concepts of confidence, guilt or nostalgia. I am very private, I am in my 20's and have never spoken to anyone like this, until now I guess. People tell me it is always harder to talk to strangers, but I find it is harder to talk to people I am familiar with, I understand their interests, and must always consider them into what I say, whereas strangers are so temporary so it doesn't really matter what I say. I think i am naturally rude, but I try very hard not to be, I can even come off as kind if I don't talk too much. I have never stayed in contact with friends once I have moved house/school, regardless of how close we were. There is a place I love to go, I love the smells, sounds and atmosphere, with people going about their day, I stand within the bustling crowd taking in the environment with a grin on my face, I am the only one there who is still, the only one who is relaxed. Another day, in the same place, I might smell a disgusting smell and it puts me off the whole area, I start seeing the people as degenerate and their busyness becomes the scurrying of rats that shouldn't be on the street. 

Despite this disconnection from other people, I am happy. I feel more positive emotion than negative, by a long way. I often feel overwhelming euphoria, it starts in my head with tingles like a time-lapse of stars under my skin, it travels and consumes my body until I cannot feel anything except the flickering of soft electricity, then iI close my eyes to darkness, so the experience isn't dampened by the dull limitations of the eye, then I feel the surfaces of the surrounding area, smell, touch and hearing become one sensation, whilst sight is replaced by a vibrant monochromatic awareness of the space that my surroundings take up, I feel the grass outside my house moving and the rigidity of the walls that populate the area. Yeah it is a great experience, i'd recommend it (try music).

&amp;#x200B;

So like I said, it is very unusual for me to reach out to people about this, I hope it isn't illegible to anyone who isn't in my head. There is a lifetime of things I have missed, but no one wants to read all that. Let me know what you think.",24Jun2019,1
194,"My life has been a continuing pattern since I can remember. My family always been dysfunctional, authority figures abusive, And I was always bullied in school. As I teenager I coped by rebelling, I got in fights, Skipped school, failed all my classes then fell into depression and started self harming. My mom never wanted to talk or see why I was doing what I was doing and just threw me In phys- hospitals. A couple years later I fell pregnant, I knew I'd make myself get prepared to work hard to give my child a good life. I never completed my high school education and am now working on getting a GED. Me and my childs father are in a complicated relationship now a days and I'm living with my mom who is verbally abusive and completely over bearing. She constantly harasses me for my choices and calls me trash and drags me for not having a diploma. It is hell having to depend on her for things because she constantly uses it as amo against me. I know the only reason why she keeps me here is because she loves my child. I am working but cant work full time or go to trade school until December and even then I will still be financially drained.

197,"I don't think that I deserve treatment. 
I just figured out a pattern. After I talked with my nutritionist and we discussed drinks that you probably shouldn't drink (often) one off them being orange juice.
All of the sudden I started to buy and drink orange juice often, even though I knew that I shouldn't. Every time I lost weight I'd drink more orange juice, because I specifically remember her saying that it's not a good idea. For the longest time I didn't know why I did it but then I realized why. I was happy. For the first time in years I'm working on myself and I was happy and I was losing weight. And I don't think I deserve to.

It's the weirdest feeling, because I have always wanted to loose weight, but now I'm trying to manipulate my weightloss. I should be losing more weight. I  could be losing more weight. However something keep holding me back and telling me that I don't deserve that. Because it makes me happy and I don't deserve to be happy.

Now theraphy is like the antonym to my orange juice. 

I know that it can help. I know I don't really love orange juice. I know that the one bad experience of therapy shouldn't stop me, because it can help me. But I don't believe that I deserve help and even when I need it I'd rather work tirelessly to help myself than to ask for help. But that annoying part of my brain doesn't want me to help myself it wants me to drink orange juice. It doesn't want me to ask for help, because it believes that we're only dealt cards that we can deal with. And I can deal with it. If I can't and I break down it's my fault.

 Just like if I drink orange juice and I don't loose weight it's all my fault. I would deserve to not loose weight because I did what I wasn't supposed to do. So there are consequences. 
But what if I didn't drink the orange juice and I didn't loose weight?
What if I go to therapy and they can't help me? 
If I can't help myself that's fine, but if they can't help me than there's something wrong with me. 

So I keep drinking orange juice even though  I don't love orange juice.

198,"No need to read, I'm just using this as a diary. Need to get everything out of my head. 
And my neighbor knows my reddit, so if you're here, Anael, leave. 

I don't know what's happening I feel horrible and cry every single night. I'm stuck. I've never wanted to say it but I think I'm depressed, but I don't know. I just don't. These mood drops only happen at night, well at least, up until now, but yesterday I ended up crying and feeling awful during the day. It was the first time ever.

I've tried going to therapy, but I really didn't like the girl, I hated how she was trying to read me while I was reading her, and a freaking probationer/trainee was also there, and my mom as well, and I know it was just the first time so that's why but then I just didn't want to anymore and my brain was too scared and lazy to go back so i ended up making up excuses to not go again, just like I always do, and my mom agreed.

I couldn't open up to her, because it was daytime. I CANNOT open up during the day, I've put on this happy mask during the day for over 16 years, I can't just take it off like that. 
And when I do open up to people late at night, then the next few days, they don't leave me alone and keep harassing me to know if I'm okay and I hate being looked after like I'm weak. 

I barely shower or clean myself, I'm overeating, I push everyone away, and mainly, I cry.
I always was this really goofy and happy girl, and have now became the complete opposite.

I know the main cause of this phase, but i was also like that before, just not as intense. 
I crushed on this guy, and from the way he would talk to me I thought things went well, and one day he was a little harsh with me, so I thought he was just having a bad day and left him alone for a week, came back and this time he got really mad at me and told me how annoying I was. The worst thing is, I know I was annoying, and I'm not actually like that, I was just so nervous with him and was blinded by him. We haven't talked since, and for now I'm not planning on going back to him. Soon he'll leave to another city really far, so I guess it'll help. 
So that was the main problem that started it all. But on top of that, we have a mutual friend who is throwing a birthday party on the 26th of June, and I thought I was going to be invited, and got really excited, thinking it was the perfect occasion to show my crush what he's missing, but turns out I'm not invited. And my sister is invited, so I constantly hear about this party. It drives me nuts because it was the PERFECT occasion. 
By the way, I've tried multiple times to get invited. Last time I tried was this morning, I was going absolutely nuts, thinking ""my plans are ruined, but since when do I not do anything about it? I always get what I want. I can't just sit here and cry about it, I'm going to regret it forever if I don't try one last time, wondering what would've happened if I did"", so I did, but it was once again unsuccessful. I think I'll manage to get invited to futur parties, but I'm pretty sure the boy who rejected me won't be there, so no point to it. 

I also have my drama play coming up on the 26th as well, didn't practice much, my French final oral exam, which I didn't study for, and I have to get my drivers license within a month. I feel so overwhelmed with everything.

I've also made the dumb dumb dumb decision to bring this guy I had barely met with my family and I this summer in Romania to go see my family, and I have tried so many times, my mom REFUSES to cancel. And of course, I don't get along with the guy anymore. I'm so sick of him, and I hate that he'll get the 'privilege' of meeting my family, I don't like him enough, he doesn't 'deserve' to meet them. Once the trip is over, he's OUT. 
He's a nice guy, but I'm sick of some of my friends saying I'm too harsh. Yes I am, I know, but I literally can't do anything about it. Once my brain decides to hate something or someone, there's no going back. There are so so so so many things about him that drive me insane, we're just not compatible at all, and on top of that because of all of my other mental issues right now, it doesn't help anything.

I've finally felt like I had so many friends and wow how cool. But whenever I want to hang out, no one can or wants. There are some which I have no problem with, but the others, I feel like they vaguely like me and find me funny, and the rest of the time they use me or drag me along because they feel bad or I don't know.

I constantly procrastinate, and I cancel things because, well, I don't even know. My brain just says ""no"", and when I ask why, there's no reasoning. Except ""I don't feel like it"". Yeah okay, but meanwhile, I'm losing life opportunities. I've been thinking about enrolling in my city's drama conservatory for 2 years now. Last year, during the registration period, my brain just said ""nah, I don't feel like it, I don't want to"", so I didn't, and now the registration period just started, but nah, of course my brain doesn't want to. And I am so lost, I don't know if I should, or if it's actually my instinct telling me that there's no need for the conservatory (I already go to drama class every week, and plan on going to an acting college after high school, it's already enough).
My mom doesn't recommend me to go this year. She says last year I should've, but this year I have the finals. But I don't know if I should listen to her, a lot of the time I end up regretting it. I don't know I don't know I don't know, who should I listen to I'm so lost.

So overall my main issues are; the boy rejecting me, the party I'm not invited to, the trip with the guy I dislike, too many important things to do and not enough time, the conservatory.

I hate how I sometimes get really motivated at night. Because when I get motivated, I can't do anything because I'm tired, and then, in the morning I'm really really unmotivated and never end up doing those things I wanted to do the night before. 

I've done so many dumb things to get the attention of some boys, and hate myself for, like kissing girls in front of him, when he cleary told me he liked discreet girls, or going out of my way to see him, and so so so many other things.

I don't understand why I get sick of everyone, as if I was any better than them. I need a change, constant change. New new new, sick of old and routine. I am extremely empathic and can accurately read people. I'm always right about it, always.
I'm constantly bored at home. I wake up, YouTube, I go to bed. That's literally it, every single day.
I live my life through others, and I love it, but it's becoming more and more unhealthy. I'd rather watch someone workout, study or even do something fun and be happy for 10 hours a day, than actually do any of those things. 

I want to be in September. I will have forgotten about the party, I won't think about the guy as much, the trip will be over and I will have cut all contact with the dude, the exams and the play will be done, plus the beginning of the school year, meaning I'll make new friends, and probably find a new boy to have a crush on and who will hopefully not hurt me, and help me forget about all the previous guys.

I hate those dumb tips online to cure depression by exercising, eating well, and sleeping. I mean, yeah, my diet kind of sucks, and I don't work out a whole lot, but it's fine, my habits aren't crazy unhealthy.

I was thinking about writing a letter to everyone who makes me feel sad, to let my feelings out, but never send it. Also do a bit of scripting. But I can't open up to friends, I don't want to let in all of this negativity in our conversations. 

I guess that's all for now. I was bawling my eyes out when I started writing, but I'm calmer now, and actually feel a little better. 
Not sure if it's because I've opened up and written my feelings down or because I'm way too tired to cry, but I'll use this as an opportunity to go to sleep. 

Good night.",24Jun2019,1
199,"Not sure if anyone knows the answer to this, but today i had a really weird moment of sorts, i don't even know what to call it, what i felt was:  


1. i didn't feel like myself, much
2. i felt distant emotionally, and a bit numb
3. i felt comfortable, but.. not the good kind of comfortable, the *too* comfortable, eerily comfortable, unsettlingly comfortable 
4. everything felt surreal and off
5. my own voice felt slightly distant, like hearing someone else's voice, there was less of mental recognition that that was my voice, it almost felt like i was hearing someone else talk, but it was just my own voice, it just felt a bit distant and foreign 

The next two parts are mainly what i'm asking for, as these two are the first time I've experienced something like this, the above four symptoms I've all felt before, either separately or all together. 

&amp;#x200B;

6. everything felt eerily and unsettlingly quiet, not like a boredom quiet, but like my hearing was slightly lessened, not that i had trouble hearing people, not that lessened, but enough to notice things sounded quieter.

7. but it wasn't just a hearing quiet, it was also a quiet in thoughts, like i had a mental fog, like i could barely think or visualize things, i was too out of my own head, and too in the present that it felt surreal and not comfortable or normal, it felt like i was being blocked out of my own head. I could barely hear myself think either, if anyone knows how when you're typing, or reading something, or simply thinking to yourself, you usually narrate it in your head, and it's usually in your voice (or another voice if the context calls for it), yeah i couldn't hear my own thoughts, it was like a mental quiet too. 

&amp;#x200B;

You should REALLY consider getting off of Reddit.

  

Reddit was once a fantastic forum website due to its high quality niche content and its really involved, engaging members. I believe times have changed.  Now,  Reddit is a website filled with negative and demoralizing, shallow content. It has lost its ability to have civil, productive conversations and, instead, every post is now riddled with hate comments, low effort replies, and hivemind responses. Test it out - go to any post on the front page of reddit and the majority of responses with be critiquing somebody or discrediting the topic at hand. People have been trained to be negative. I think it's fair to say that most commenters on this site are contrarians now, only looking to be negative to serve their own self-interests. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whether you have realized it or not, if you actively use Reddit, your opinions and mind are being shaped to correspond with whatever the hivemind of Reddit dictates is ""right"". You might believe that Keanu Reeves is the best actor of all time, Donald Trump is pure evil, the United States is falling apart, and a whole host of other beliefs that you have never questioned. People will often disagree that Reddit is turning for the worse and just continue to be manipulated by the content on the site.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to the hivemind mentality, a lot of content on Reddit is just plain negative and corrupting knowledge. If you are a teenager or an impressionable person using Reddit, you will quickly believe that the world is a mean, scary place when that is rarely the case. The front page is filled with headlines of terror attacks, murders, crimes committed by corporations. It leads you to believe that you shouldn't trust anyone and should be scared of reality.

&amp;#x200B;

I encourage you to take a break from Reddit or quit it if you can. Some small subreddits are still good but besides that, it isn't very redeeming of a website anymore. Users of this site are becoming angry at the world and at other people, scared of reality, and the overall opinion on a variety of subjects is being shifted without them even knowing.
