0,"I have been sharing some of my journey on a few different sub Reddit’s during the last couple of weeks. Yesterday wasn’t great and I ran away to kill myself. I was found before I had a chance to do anything drastic and ended up speaking to the police who then sent me to the hospital. 

I spoke to some mental health ‘professionals’ and told them what was going on. Which was so hard since part of my problem, Jamie this person that I see, is
Very violent and doesn’t like it when I talk about him. So it was very hard to tell them anything because I had to try and hold him back from hurting them as well. 

They didn’t put me into a hospital. I wish they did. But my dad doesn’t like them so he said no. It’s not even his choice. I’m an adult for Fucks sake..

I’m speaking to someone tomorrow. Apparently they’ve had similar experiences. I don’t know. My dad also hasn’t called up about another meeting so I can get some anti psychotics. (Which he was told to do today but ‘it’s down we will get to it sometimes this week’)

I had an up and down day today. I saw two movies at the cinema. Both triggered me. I got my nails done. I didn’t like the people touching my hands but they feel pretty now. I usually do them myself but I’m not being allowed out of my parents sight and they don’t like the sound of my nail file (which you need a lot when doing acrylics just in case you didn’t know) 

There was someone following us though. They were trying to get into my head again. And someone was watching from down the road to the house I’m staying in (other issue that happened has left me homeless). I saw a load of animals in the front room. I can tell they aren’t real because they shouldn’t be there but. They just look and sound and feel so real...  

At least I’m sort of getting help? Edwood wants me to cut at least if I cannot kill myself. I know it’s bad still but I guess it’s better. My mum took away all of my blades though. I have another lighter I can use but it doesn’t have the same effect. 

Anyway, I hope your having an ok day. Thanks for reading. ",10Feb2019,1
1,"Today i made a mistake that others should know about before doing the same. Recently my s/o has been very depressed and isolated, having just moved across the country, and after a morning argument began talk of suicide. She left.  Convinced i would lose her, and never hear of her death due to a lack of paper connecting us, i called the suicide prevention line to ask advice for what to do. The counselor advised i call the local nonemergency line for the police department to ""let them know someone may be at risk"" and to ""give context for if she is found"" and so that i would be contacted with the news. I did so. It started benignly, but after taking my information it quickly turned into an open case and was taken out of my hands. They put a BOLO out on her car and said that upon finding her she will be taken to the hospital for an evaluation. Not only was this not what i wanted, i couldnt put a stop to it. Once the police report is opened, only they can close it. This, of course, greatly escalated the matter when she returned apologizing, as she had asked me not to call anyone about what she had said/was threatening to do. Now she cant come home because the police are passing the house in case she returns, and she doesnt want the evaluation for fear of being committed.

TL;DR: police become liable upon learning of someone with suicidal thoughts. It will not end without MANDITORY psych eval, potentially hospitalization. ",10Feb2019,1

3,"This is a crosspost from /r/relationships because there is a strong mental health aspect to this story and any help I can get from people more familiar with mental health issues would be fantastic. Based in the UK as per rule 3.

So, long story short my gf and I are doing long distance as she is still at uni and I am job seeking. We still see each other every 2-3 weeks as I'm not that far away. She has a history of anxiety and the stress of uni and being away from home is getting to her. Her schedule and workload are a nightmare and to be quite honest I don't think it's the right environment for her, and that she's forcing herself to stay out of spite and stubbornness and fear that she'd regret it. She is miserable all the time and it wouldn't surprise me if she's spiraling into full-blown depression, considering how she is and a few other symptoms which don't merit discussion here. Unfortunately I'm not an expert on mental health, and she has a lot of trouble opening up about how she's feeling to anyone. But she is miserable all the time from uni stress, missing her family, and missing me.

As you might expect, this puts a bit of a strain on the relationship. She is fine most of the time, but sometimes late at night when she's tired she'll start talking to me about how she can't do it because she is always missing me. She's never direct enough to say she wants to break up and is deliberately vague so it's never clear whether she's just lamenting the situation or trying to build towards something. She seems happy to be with me 99% of the time but every so often, late at night I'll just get ""I can't do this"" or ""I'm always missing you and its awful"". Bear in mind for context with that first line she will often say ""I can't do it"" or be self-defeating as an exaggeration for when something is difficult and isn't out of the ordinary or definitive.

Now the kicker in all this is that I genuinely believe I help her mental health. That I keep her more stable than she would otherwise be. She tells me things about her wellbeing which she doesn't tell anyone else and that she *needs* to tell someone. She won't bring it up with her friends, family, or medical professionals despite my nudging her to do so. This isn't an ordinary relationship issue because of that aspect - in addition to us loving each other and wanting to stay together, there is also the element that I really think I help to stabilize her on her bad days and that I'm her lifeline on the mental health aspect because she doesn't tell anyone else everything she should, and as much as I try, that's not likely to change.

I'm at a loose end here. I don't know whether she wants to end things or not, and if she does whether it's her or a combination of the tiredness and some serious mental health issues talking. And if it does end, it puts her in a bad place with her mental health as she loses her support and I dread to think where the added unhappiness from a breakup would push her. She really is happy and excited to see me the overwhelming majority of the time, with no fizzling or a sense that we're just coasting on inertia. It's just when she gets into a dark place of an evening and hates the world then that's something on the chopping block. I'm not sure where else to turn. Despite the conversations hurting a lot I can't exactly ask her to stop because if there's legitimate need there then I can't cling to things like that, but if it's just the mental health it most likely only makes things worse for both of us.

tl;dr GF and I are long distance. She has a lot of stress combined with some somewhat serious mental health issues - anxiety and potentially depression. She opens up to me about them to an extent she doesn't do to anyone else but *needs* to talk to someone about. Despite being happy for the 99% of the time, when she's tired and in a bad place she sometimes makes vague statements about whether she wants to be in the relationship or not. I am unsure whether that's coming from her or her mental health.",10Feb2019,1

I was socially isolated and had no friends in the city i lived in because i burnt those bridges. It was my fault but in a way it wasn't because i was manipulated and used. Like i said, it's like I wasn't even a person.

19,"I'm 19 and this has gone on for maybe 6 or 7 years. I've made very few social connections in my life. I've had ""friends"" but they have always been superficial and short-lived relationships. I have never had any romantic or sexual relationships. In school, it was severe social anxiety that kept me from reaching out to my peers. But towards the end of my high school years (I was admitted to a residential psych facility and dropped out senior year, got my GED while living there. My GPA was about 0.9. There was no recovering from that) I greatly overcame my fears about being judged and, though still moderately awkward, I wanted to form relationships with the people around me. I got a job after returning home but lost it within a month due to bipolar episodes and not being able to handle the stress. So I applied to community college. There I made a couple superficial friends, but after dropping out 3 quarters in due to failing grades and loss of financial aid those relationships disappeared. I finally swallowed my pride and applied for disability benefits on the basis of bipolar disorder. I've been approved for one program and I'm waiting to be denied for the second so I can get a lawyer and fight it. I've quickly realized that being a young person that isn't employed or attending school makes meeting new people really hard. And if I do meet someone, they want to know where I'm working or what I'm going to school for because that's what young people are doing. When I tell them I'm unable to work or attend school due to ""health reasons"", their interest in being around me dies. I feel worthless. And you know what? I kind of am. Being depressed from the beginning of junior high, I never developed hobbies or interests. The only hobby I enjoy is gaming and that interest stems from pre-depression days. Regardless, I haven't played a video game in a long time. I can't find the energy for solo activities. I just want people. I haven't interacted with anyone outside my immediate family in months, spare my counselor. So all this time I've been talking to people in my head. People that I've made up and fictional conversations with people I know. I know these aren't real voices, but sometimes I ""lose control"" of what the other person is saying and the voice sounds louder and clearer and so real. I've had hallucinations before, and I think that may be what I'm experiencing. It's like my conversations are coming to life with a mind of their own. The loss of control moments have become more frequent. I think I'm losing my mind. I don't know what the point of this post is. Just venting thoughts because who else is here to listen.",10Feb2019,1
20,"Hi, so, never posted in this subreddit before but i need some mental health advice. warning, this may be long. 

I’m diagnosed depressed and anxious, for about two years now. maybe six months or a year ago i was diagnosed with a mild form of bipolar disorder. i’m not sure exactly what it’s called (i can never remember) but it has “cyclo-“ at the beginning of the name. 

i’m on melatonin for sleep, 5mg of Lexapro for my anxiety and depression, and 75mg of Lamictdol (idk if i spelled that right) for my mood disorder.

so lately, like past month or so, i’ve been really lonely and depressed and slipping back into some old patterns from back before was medicated. stuff like being irritable, being suicidal, etc. it’s gotten really bad the past week or so. i’ve been extremely sad, cut myself off from friends (the few that i have), and my mom says i’m acting weird. i’ve been struggling with my mental health since 7th or 8th grade (i’m now a junior in high school) and this is the worst i’ve felt in about two years, when i was at my lowest ever point. 

since i’ve been regressing, and my therapy and meds don’t seem to be keeping me stable anymore, i’ve been considering asking my therapist and my social worker about maybe going inpatient. i think it would help me a lot to be checked into a hospital or something. 

however, i am very nervous about asking. i’m scared that i’ll never get out of the hospital, that they’ll deem me dangerous to myself or crazy or something. i’m also extremely worried about the potential schoolwork and finals i’d miss if i went inpatient soon. i’ve never been inpatient before and i don’t really know what to expect. 

i’m just not sure what to do. maybe i should just die and not worry about this shit anymore. anyway if anybody has been inpatient before or can offer any advice, it would be greatly appreciated!!

TL;DR- i’ve been slipping back into my old depressive and suicidal moods lately. i’m wondering if i should check myself into a mental hospital or something to get some help since medication and therapy isn’t helping anymore. however i am very scared to go inpatient. help? advice pls????

21,"Hi everyone, I never thought I'd come to ask this question as it seemed like such a foreign disease.

My brother (33) lives in another country and has 3 children, aged 2 to 6. SO many things happened randomly during the years, but I never connected the dots. Recently he told me that people are following him around town, he is sometimes seeing and meeting an old exgirlfriend (who is 600km away from him, so not possible). A few years ago he asked me to check his computer, phone and wireless connection to see if someone might have ""infiltrated"" his network or devices. Giving the benefit of the doubt, I checked everything and nothing weird was happening, but every time I visited the wireless router was turned off (supposedly because of the dangers of radio waves). My brother has a PhD and knows that all the scare is bullshit, but I understand that we're not always rational beings.

Anyway, he came to visit me last summer with the kids and girlfriend, and he mentioned to me scaredly that some people from our country are following him, and he saw them a couple of times.

His girlfriend almost left him a couple of times because she thought he was cheating on her, but she seemed to understand that this ""ex-gf"" is not really real. Technically, she is, but she's really far away and hasn't spoke to him in more than 5 years.

He also told me that sometimes they communicate using youtube videos with special meanings to them, through fake profiles.

A few weeks ago thought, he accused my father of touching one of the nephews and she told him that my aunt is going to punish him for this (that aunt died more than 10 years ago) for this, because he also molested her or something like that. My father has never touched me, my sister or my brother inappropriately. He mentioned a couple of times that he saw this happening, one of which I was there and nothing happened. Me and my father were playing with a niece, and her leggings came off a bit. Another time the kids were jumping on the beds while my parents were trying to watch TV and they grabbed them by the legs so they would stop jumping since they didn't listen and the bed is like 1m from the ground.

While putting all this on paper it seems like my brother has schizophrenia, but I'm not sure and will not be until a diagnosis is confirmed. I want to help him, but the problem is that I'm 4000km away from him and so are our parents. The girlfriend seems to have shut down after this accusations started so not much I can do.

So I really don't know what I'm looking for, but how would you help him? Don't know where to start, and I feel so helpless being so far away. Does this sound like schizophrenia?

22,"Over a year ago i was in a dark place, the stress of my Alevel combined with my introverted nature lead me have some messed up thoughts. i had transferred school for sithform so i new almost nobody there. I would sit on my own and could feel people staring at me, and i swear i could hear the disgust at me even being there. Home wasn't any better as my family is always so busy i never thought that the way i felt was important enough to warrant any of their time, i had the same job back then ans mental health was the butt of the joke most day so no refuge there. All my friends from my old school had exams or other problems so we met maybe 1 every other month. The only place that i felt safe was in my room with the door closed tight this resulted in me faking being sick, shoving my finger down my throat just so i didn't have to lie to my family. I was 17 at the time so not legally required to go to school but eventually the school contacted my parents as my grades were slipping, my parents thought i had autism or something that was making me not want to be around people so they made an appointment with a GP. that appointment i had a mental breakdown in, balling my eyes out i tried to explain every thought that crossed my mind in the 4 months. when i finally manged to get all of my bottled feelings out i turned to my left and my mum was crying just as much as i was, i never want to do that to her again, the GP took many notes gave me a proscription for some antidepressants(which they bumped up after 2 weeks). the next week we got a letter for a councillor the GP referred me too. The pills made me feel like a robot but they allowed me to show up to classes and scrap a passing grade, the councillor gave me a person to vent to and showed me strategy's to minimise the panic i would send myself into.

26,"When I was 16 I witnessed a violent murder. I was worryingly good at lying to my parents. Abusing their trust completely, I’d say I was going for sleepovers at my friend’s houses, sending prepared staged photos of our ‘sleepovers’. 

In actuality we’d sneak out and explore the city the entire night. I was going through a premature drug phase (I’m repulsed by drugs now) and was hanging out at a skate park regularly. One night a group of 20ish young men and teenage boys invaded the park, they came over and introduced themselves. I shook hands with one. Little did I know that same boy would beat someone to death in front of me ten minutes later.

The guys had a plastic bag containing bottles of alcohol and I’m sure some weed or something in it. They were hanging out one side of the park and we were sat diagonal, watching them argue with a homeless dude who’d wandered over to them. This argument turned into a scuffle that was broken up my someone we knew. Sure enough later the homeless man returned, tried to take off running with the bag full of alcohol only to be smacked in the neck almost instantly with a metal pole knocking him unconscious. But not before he landed on these glass bottles, shattering them and piercing them into his face and body. From then onwards chaos ensued. And if anyone wants me to go into further detail I will but essentially he was brutally beaten to death. 

I was a 16 year old girl in the wrong place at the wrong time, now in major shock. When instructed by the friend who initially tried to stop the fight ,to run. I ran. An ambulance was on its way and the perps had also fled the scene, not before videoing the guy as he lay dying.

In the rest of the summer that followed I had night terrors and experienced horrific PTSD. I was angry at the world, it was evil and violence was everywhere. Seemingly desensitised I grew morbidly curious with death, spent hours on Liveleak, BestGore, Documenting reality etc. Eventually so angry that I wanted revenge, revenge on the people who had actually hurt me. I wanted to hurt people, murder them. I won’t go into anymore detail but it was bad. 

I went into therapy and was put on medication that only made things worse, I ended up in the hospital with drug induced psychosis. Now a few years later I’m off meds and doing better than ever. But in therapy I’m having to talk about it and after a few recent nightmares, the thoughts are back, I’m angry again and my brain is flooded with violence.

27,"First the backstory:
       For the last year or so, I've been seeing a therapist and Psyciatrist for what they called anxiety and potential a mood disorder. All I knew at the time was that something was wrong. I was in college, had a hard time focusing and studying, and would sleep 10 hours a day, usually waking up incredibly tired in the morning. I'm not exceptionally good at describing emotions or how I feel, and so with the information I gave, their diagnosis was anxiety. However, after a few different medications (All of which made things worse) I had retreated home to online study's, and stopped taking my medication after my life fell back into order (with my parents *cough* ""coaxing"" *cough*). I felt much better, but didn't let my Psyciatrist know I was stopping. Oh, and I smoke weed (which of course the doc blamed for everything wrong with me)

Now for where I need advice:
So I've been off my medication for a few months now, and anxiety has not been a problem, but I still suffer from a lot of the things that lead to my failures in college. Lack of attention, inability to concentrate on things that I want to, and by all means should enjoy, but don't. I want to talk to my Psyciatrist about adhd, but again, I'm bad at describing what I'm feeling, since to me I just feel... well... Like always. I don't want him to think I'm looking for stimulants because I'm just a druggy or anything like that. I've taken stimulants before from friends, and they actually really help, but I'm not sure if that's even something I should mention, since it's a controlled substance, and technically as far as paperwork goes I was abusing it, since it's not my prescription. Any advice would be hugely appreciated. I have a therapist appointment the day before so I plan to talk about how to describe what I'm feeling with her, but I'm terribly worried the Psyciatrist will think I'm exhibiting drug seeking behavior, especially since he wasn't exactly pleased that I quite his last regimine cold turkey without saying anything.

So I asked myself this. ""Why don't we all just stop?"" As simple as that. Just tune out. No more commenting, sharing, tweeting, hashtagging, or even reacting to ANY posts by the media online or otherwise. They could post a dozen Trump posts an hour only to come back to their social media pages to see that no one has liked, commented, shared, or really paid attention to a single one of them. I know it's not possible to get this message out and get every single person onboard, but imagine if we could cut down their viewership but a high percentage?

Whether you wanna admit to it or not, the media (right or left) is only interested in telling you what to think, how to feel, what to be outraged about, who to vote for, etc. Without your rage and emotions, they would be nothing.

Mondays would be a great start, but imagine if we could extend this to other days? Hell, even all days? Don't watch or listen to the news. Take up a new hobby, or get active on another one. Go out and make friends. Eat good food. Go see a movie. Enjoy the world. 

Stop being pawns. It'll be much better for your head.",10Feb2019,1

I’m turning 18 on feb 22 and depression is still spiraling, getting worse. I’m so alienated from myself and from everyone and from this earth, I am not a victim but I am my own predator, I don’t want pity I just want to connect man.. somebody who understands, I feel like I’m being dragged through this life.. it’s like my energy is literally being sucked by dark entities, constantly drained, loosing emotions but crying too much, breakdowns in my room, I don’t want to break my moms heart but I just don’t know what to do anymore. It’s hurting Me and I know it hurts you to see me this way, you won’t go in my room. I’m so sorry.

34,"Hi everyone, I know this isn’t a diagnostic site but I feel like I need some unbiased opinions on what might be going on with me. I’m a 36 yo male, I think I’ve got a lot going for me, mostly things are good in my life I have a good family who is grateful for but I have always had anxiety and my moods have been all over the place. I have gotten way more outgoing as I’ve gotten older and most people think I’m definitely an extrovert which I am. I still have anxiety though although most people probably wouldn’t know because I talk to most everyone easily and find it pretty easy to make friends. The main thing bothering me is my mood swings that seem to be getting worse. Here’s the deal,if someone says something that I perceive as critical, I obsess over it and can go into the depths of deep depression at the drop of a hat, but then if someone else pays me a compliment I can instantly come out of it. Also I tend to be very impulsive and am most always exhuberant and expressive, and pretty vivacious, however I have done some really impulsive things sometimes just based on how high my mood is. Then, I tend to have a couple days where I’m more calm and subdued, and sometimes I tend to get very melancholy for no reason and can brood and just almost shut down so it can be pretty obvious. It’s like I’m just all over the place. A lot of times I forget things my short term memory is pretty bad sometimes. I’m seeing a psychiatric nurse and he thinks I have anxiety with a little ptsd from bullying I got during school and is treating me with Xanax as needed and has prescribed me antidepressants such as lexapro and now cymbalta but I am afraid to take them. I use cbd oil sometimes for anxiety and it does help some but my moods are still all over the place. A friend of mine is a psychologist and he said he thought I was bipolar and should be on a mood stabilizer plus something like Zoloft but that was just his opinion as someone who knows me. I have never been on a mood stabilizer before and the psych nurse I go to now said they tested me for bipolar and I did not match any of the criteria at all. So I’m not sure. Are the mood swings just part of my personality then? And I never have depression lasting days or weeks it’s usually just like a few hours if I feel real depressed but mainly it’s just anxiety that comes and goes and erratic moods. Thanks for any helpful comments/thoughts! ",10Feb2019,1
35,"So about 2 weeks ago I experienced mild chest warmth, which turned to extreme burning. I went to the urgent Care, and they checked my heart vitals which came out good, and ruled my issue as GERD, before going in I also thought it was that or an ulcer, but went to make sure it wasn't some weird heart attack. But I don't know if what I'm feeling is real anymore, and that could mean my mental is breaking down. So while I had those chest burning feeling, I would feel like water would be moving around my chest, freely, kinda dripping to my arms when laying sideways. Whenever I drank water or ate anything. I've been taking antiácids since my visit though, and since then I no longer feel whicked burns, just the dripping all around my torso. With it pooling around my sides if I lay down sideways. But since yesterday, I felt a weird visceral feeling from where I usually feel the water originate. It kinda hurt, but instead of feeling droplets, It felt More, Thicker, and after a few minutes I started feeling itching in my chest, and upper delts, but the thing is, it doesn't feel like paresthesia, since I've felt that from beta alanine before, but instead it feels like something is poking me from the inside. Which I thought maybe could be me leaking the tortilla chips I ate. But I told myself the feeling was in my head. But the thing is, if it was real, why am I feeling it again, I didn't eat tortilla chips, I ate crackers with some water, but those are mushy if anything. But I still felt the water leaking around today, it just felt more.. thicker than usual, unlike water. But now I feel these annoying prickles whenever I move or press on my arms, chest, and stomach. But accompanied with the dripping, Im just so.. annoyed. I could take the dripping, not both. I cant move without feeling weird pokes. I'm not sure if I'm fully going insane now. Is feeling things like this a signal of mental instability? Or do I have something more serious? Before these 2 weeks I never felt anything like this ",10Feb2019,1
36,"I was battling over whether to put this on r/vent or r/mentalhealth so sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this. 

It's currently 3:56.a.m. . I've got school on Monday.  But what's the point? What's the point of living. I don't matter, not really. Sure there'd be a few people who would be upset if I died,  but it wouldn't matter.  
I've written countless suicide notes over the years. I never scrap them, I just occasionally go back and edit them. It's 3:56 a.m., why shouldn't I just watch more fuckin YouTube to help me forget. Why the fuck should I sleep? What's the fucking point? I'm just a fat useless fuck who can't do anything right. I can't starve myself for long enough or stop myself from eating,  I can't succeed in life,  I have no friends,  I don't have the guts to get help because some stupid fuckin Dr that made a stupid assumption that really fucked be up.  I can't take criticism, I can't stand confrontation. I can't even fucking send out a thank you note for Christmas without my heart feeling like it's going to explode. I have nothing to give to anyone.  
Why the fuck should I live through school? The only thing I want to do with my life is impossible for me.  I wish my ceiling was high enough to hang myself.  The only reason I don't is because I'm fucking terrified of consequences.  I will never be the person I want to be,  I'm too fucking scared. I have nobody.  Nobody wants me. I would be doing everyone a favour if I just killed myself. I was the closest to doing it 4 years ago,  when I wasn't aware,  when I didn't even know what depression was, when I truly believed that no one cared. I should have done it back then.  I know now that a few people do care and that just makes me feel fuckin worse.

37,"You can look through my post history for context but long story short. I’m trans, and when I was outed my mom signed me up with a therapist who agreed with her views and, because she thought being trans was caused by depressive disorder (I know this because of her search history) got me on Sertraline. I am almost 14.

I’ve been on it for a month,  each tablet is 50mg, I usually get one and a half at night, and sometimes in the morning I believe. It’s hard for me to remember because I’m just handed a bunch of pills every morning when I wake up and I’m still groggy. I know I do get them sometimes in the morning. I started with a lower dose but now I’m taking more.

Anyway, a couple weeks in I started getting really bad hand tremors. I’m an artist so this made me really frustrated, but if the medicine was helping I figured I could make sacrifices. Problem is it wasn’t making anything better. About a week or two ago I got really scared at night and I carved into my skin on my leg with a sharp piece of plastic, and I’ve been doing that almost every day since. It makes me feel a lot better, but I feel really bad when I don’t have the chance to cut. I can’t stop thinking about suicide. I don’t want to die but I also really want to . I am also constantly in a state of unrest. Like the feeling before I’m about to get a panic attack, just constantly. 

I’ve told my mom I hate taking the medicine and when she asks why I don’t know how to tell her. I hate my therapist with all my passion so I don’t really talk to him, and I don’t want to talk to him either. I think the last session I went to a few days ago will be my final one. I don’t know how to get off the medicine or if I should. I want to stop cutting and having suicidal thoughts.

As a Catholic man, I believe that pornography is immoral and that masturbation is a form of sex outside of marriage. Me, personally? I just know that I feel incredibly dirty whenever I view pornography or masturbate, or even view pornography *and* masturbate. In a way, I can feel my conscience screaming ""VIOLATION! VIOLATION!"" But I seemingly can't stop. It has become habit. Tuesdays and Thursdays when I return home from class? First stop is my room. Mondays and Wednesdays when I'm alone for 7+ hours each day? You can bet I'll probably be up there at least once. This past Friday, I challenged myself to go 24 hours without masturbating. I went 28 (from 8pm Thursday to 12am Saturday), although I did give in at around 12:30am Saturday morning. How do I break myself of this habit? What can I do to resist the urges?

40,"I'm at my wit's end, I feel like I'm about to break. I can't do this anymore, I can't deal with the constant awkward tension when he's near me. I don't know how to talk to him, my family is walled off to discussions about mental health, so nobody brings up the topic. He kept it hidden for some time, but revealed his diagnosis not long ago. I wish I didn't know.

He has multiple obsessions that are making me angry, confused, and giving me a strong desire to move out, but I'm not in a position to do that. I'm constantly on edge, and my ultimate fear is his voices will tell him to hurt my family. I don't know if I can do this. I don't feel safe in my own home.

The first obsession: religion. He was an atheist for years, now he found God and goes around talking about love, and goes to church. What the hell? He's creepy--he walks around with headphones and stares off into the distance, can barely hold a conversation. Talking to him is painful, so I actively avoid him. 

Everywhere I turn, he rips open curtains and blinds to pour light into the house despite the fact that all of us have expressed that we don't want light especially in the morning. Talking to him accomplishes nothing, it's like a brick wall, he's set in his ways and will not change.

He's inconsiderate of everyone and a complete asshole. He bangs dishes like a thunderstorm in the early hours of the morning when we are all sleeping, or does laundry at those times. What kind of asshole does this to his family? How can he sit there and preach love when he's a dick? 

I don't feel any love for my mentally ill brother. I know how callous this post sounds, but the above is all true. I deal with issues of my own such as severe anxiety and depression. I can't handle all of this. I cannot live treading on eggshells for the rest of the time I am forced to live with him.

41,"After a very difficult year, I feel like I’ve lost myself. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy my life, but only because of how self-destructive it is, I indulge myself constantly, whether it be drugs, food, clothes, but none of this is productive. I feel like I can’t find any meaning to life, like I’ve tried to, and I just can’t. Nothing feels real to me anymore, and it makes me sad, but I carry on indulging myself because it’s the only thing that makes me feel better. A year ago I was in a totally different place, I felt motivated, I genuinely felt special, like I was on this planet for a reason, to do something big and great, and after a difficult year, all that’s gone. I have zero motivation, I enjoy things in the moment but don’t plan ahead because I don’t see the point. I literally take nothing seriously. In the space of a year, I’ve failed my first year at uni, became hooked to MDMA (which I no longer use), had a cancer scare with my mum (who I’m very close to) , been used and fucked over by people who I thought cared about me but we’re actually just using me, had to endure so much pressure, my dad is emotionally abusive to my mum, my relationship ended, and it’s all fucked me up. The only thing that kept me going all these years was my confidence that I was gonna do something great with my life, and now that confidence is all gone and I feel like I’m left with nothing. I feel like people don’t understand me and in all honesty I don’t understand myself, I just feel very very lost. I have great friends who I love very much, but when they’re gone and I’m left with my own thoughts it’s often a very dark place. I’m not manically depressed however, I’ve accepted this as the reality of my life and I get by. I don’t even think I have a mental illness and although I’m considering seeing a doctor, I don’t know if it would make a difference, I’ve just seen life for what it is; shit. I’m so unhappy with myself in so many ways and yet I have no motivation at all to make changes, as much as I want to.

Sadly I need assistance and participation in that class or else i fail. Not going made me really mad with myself.

Instead of studying to make up for the lost day I did nothing. I stayed at my bed all day and watched ODAAT. But that only made more sad because that family has a really good and open relationship and support and stuff...

At night I got really strong wave of (idk how to describe it) feeling of wanting to die (nothing new but I don’t like them).

45,"My grandmother has some major problems that need to be addressed. She's been prone to anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember, mostly manifesting in some mild paranoia (always making sure her windows were *completely* covered after dark even though she lives way out in the country, not leaving her nice jewelry in the house if she was gone overnight, stuff like that) but it's been slowly getting worse over the past few years.

She used to have really bad night terrors after her mother died and as of right now is having daily visual hallucinations which we suspect are tied to some kind of repressed trauma in her past. She's been to a doctor and even had a 10 day psych evaluation last summer that ruled out dementia and any physical causes we could think of and is currently taking medication for depression and anxiety but nothing specifically for the hallucinations as far as I know since they only occur in her home and the doctors couldn't see for themselves she was having any. These hallucinations are causing her to lose sleep which is in turn leaving her with very little energy or appetite (which leaves her with even less energy) and more recently she's been getting confused a lot, possibly from the combination of stress and sleep deprivation.

She also goes to a therapy group a few days a week but that doesn't seem to be helping much beyond just getting out of the house for a few hours so my parents and I discussed finding her a personal therapist to figure out the root of her problems and possibly help with medication if that's necessary (we've also brought it up to her and she's completely on board with it).

So my question here is what should we be looking for? I assume a pyschiatrist is what we need but is that right? Should we look for someone who specializes in a specific area of pyschiatry? And if so, which one?

63,"To sum it up, one of my closest friends has been struggling with his mental health for a long time. we’ve spent countless hours together calling into the late hours of the night talking about our lives and we’d help each other out. In those calls, he’d mention his suicidal thoughts and I always did whatever I could to talk him down from them. He already sees a therapist and is going to start medication soon, but recently he’s been talking about taking action.

In a series of drunk videos he’s sent to me, he told me about his plan to kill himself and when he’s going to do it. it really seemed like he had it all planned out as well: he had a date, location, and method. I tried to talk him out of it but he seems truly adamant on doing it. I know that it wasn’t a drunk ramble because he’s also mentioned the same thing when he was sober, and that really scared me. I don’t want to lose him.

I’m not sure if he’s told any of his IRL friends, but he said it was a secret so I doubt they know. but I know why he told me. we’re internet friends, and I live on the other side of the world so there’s really nothing I can do about it apart from talk to him. I would really like some advice on this situation. just something, or anything really. as long as it helps.

After this I began having anxiety and depression, obsessive thoughts, intruding thoughts, constant fear. It lessened with time, and I’ve been in therapy for 3 months and I feel like I’m nearly cured. I’m not on any medication. 

lately I’d been doing well! My fear is down to normal levels, some self harming thoughts that I quickly corrected, more happiness and feeling high energy at my job. 

I watched a horror movie with my dad tonight and I liked the plot but whenever I watch anything scary I get so on edge and it’s hard telling myself it’s just s fake story. I know it is but I need to lock the door, I’m on edge, I can’t sleep. Sometimes I’m terrified it’s actually going to happen even if I know it won’t. The movie’s main character was someone with mental illness and so it also brings back my old fears of losing control. So lack of sleep plus fear makes for a weird combination. 

I dunno maybe it’s nothing. 

And it wasn’t even a hardcore movie. So I don’t know why I got so scared. It was worse with bird box though, my sister wanted to watch it and I had to turn it off it was way too disturbing and awful. 

But can a horror movie trigger people’s issues?

Glad its not mine.” But then when I come back to reality I’m like, “Well shit...this /is/ my life.”

68,"I have to go to an urologist over some issues with the genitals, but I have huge issues with being touched or being seen naked due to a lengthy history of being sexual abused and raped throughout my childhood by multiple perpetrators.

To get the referral I had to first be checked out by a GP back in December, and that brief exam messed me up bad. The mind/body link broke and I went numb and dissociated. My PTSD flared up and emotionally I spiraled down, only managing recently to climb back out enough to no longer be suicidal.

The urologist testing will not be so brief, will be more invasive, and will also include an injection to induce an erection.

Because of my past I have never been involved in any kind of intimate relationships, and so aside from that GP I have never been handled by or naked in front of anyone except the past abusers. I don't have anybody in my life that I could bring with me for support, nor anybody whom I can practice nudity or touch with to make it easier once that time comes.

Even though I know the doctor will be professional and isn't going to try to harm me, the body doesn't care what I try to tell it. It still goes fullblown PTSD panic mode whenever I think about it, and then that affects my mood and emotional state.

I see multiple therapists for trauma, and I've spoken with them about this, but no matter what I mentally tell myself or how much I try to calm down the body won't cooperate. They tell me not to push myself because it will cause retraumatization, but what is going on cannot be left or it could have lifelong consequences.

How can I prepare myself for the PTSD to be triggered badly? This last time lasted over a month yet was far less invasive than this upcoming time.",10Feb2019,1

We're doing this because he's convinced there's some massive trauma in my life that I can't recall, so I suppose he's going to look for any really sudden gaps. 

But now that I'm writing it all out, there's a lot of traumatic shit in there that I wouldn't personally consider trauma, e.g. surrounding drugs and some questionable romantic partners.

73,"I would like to hear some of your opinions. Senator Manka Dhingra in Washington State is sponsoring a bill that would allow doctors to administer electro shock procedures on non-consenting patients in certain circumstances. 

In my opinion, we already have enough methods to restrain/subdue people who are deemed a danger to self or others. We have sedatives, tranquilizers, padded rooms, mechanical restraints, etc.

Dhingra's bill would also extend Washington's involuntary psychiatric hold from 72 hours, to 5 days. I feel like 72 hours should be plenty of time to get someone evaluated and make a decision on whether to release. 

Permanently altering someone's brain by electro shock against their will seems like going too far. What do y'all think? Here is the text of the bill. I feel like this bill is a slippery slope. What's next, legalizing lobotomies again?

My psych tried many medications but nothing worked. I don't remember what they were but none of them were controlled substances. Nothing worked, I was afraid to be alive. We eventually worked our way to Lorazepam. I was originally on .5mg 3 times a day. This actually worked, I went to college, graduated, still dealing with anxiety but I would actually live a life. After a few years, my anxiety started to creep back and came back with a vengeance and horrible depression. My psych and I had a talk and I wanted to try something else instead of raising the dose. We tried Buspar and Klonopin and I believe a few others. My anxiety was still very severe. After nothing else was working he put the dose to 1mg x3 a day. That was about 2 years ago. Since then I have moved cross country (out of my parent's house) and began living my dream as an environment artist for video games. My anxiety is still there at times (especially when I forget a dose) but It's tolerable. Here is where I need your help.

&amp;#x200B;

this story is lacking details but it would be too tedious to explain fully

(last time was maybe January 10th 2016. we had cuddled in december 2015. she told me she was cuddling with someone else. i wanted to slit my throat. she stopped doing that on her own accord. she would see me maybe once a month, i thought she had someone else. in april that year she sent me a text message to say she was leaving the state in a few weeks. i wanted answers and went through her trash and found notebooks she had thrown away. there were entries from the summer before about having sex with her then boyfriend. i photocopied the entries and sent her anonymous emails of them and others. she stopped communicating with me. i've been thinking about her nonstop and have sent her emails outlining my suicidal intentions. sometimes she opens them but never responds. my phone number is blocked.)

(I lost my virginity with a girl in high school a number of times but she had a girlfriend and was generally abusive of my feelings)

&amp;#x200B;

i can't stop thinking about the girl whose notebooks i took--her interface is everything i crave--and every time i think about her i'm humiliated and want to shoot myself. i tried to buy a gun once with the intention of immediate suicide but was denied on the fire arm application because i was in a mental health diversion program (i had a number of art installations inside maintenance rooms that weren't mine)

i can't stop thinking about driving to where she is and shooting myself in front of her.

i can't stop thinking about who any of her previous boyfriends might have been.

i can't stop thinking about what it's like to be her, and do everything she does (eat food, put on clothing, brush teeth, think thoughts, drive a car, hear music, etc. (i don't like thinking about her talking to people though))

i don't go any span of 20 minutes without thinking about killing myself.

i have passions and hobbies (at the sacrifice of having no friends)

i spend 90+ minutes every day masturbating. today was at least two hours. it helps me feel connected, and if i'm less horny i'm getting less upset about her. i can't watch pornography involving men without getting very sad. most of it is soft porn, camgirls (but vaginal videos make me uncomfortable,) or animated. I don't want to go through all of my sexual preferences and fantasies.

82,"ive explained this situation a million times to friends and my therapist so i wont go too into detail. im 23 yrs old, in nc, usa, and go by he/him.

last year my mother started losing her mind after having a seizure for the first time in her life, which was slightly traumatic for me to watch. a few months later she started becoming delusional and highly obsessive, genuine psychotic ocd symptoms, throwing clothes, food supplies, anything away that she thought had ""parasites"" in them and guilted my whole family saying we ""dont care about her issues"" because we arent experiencing them as she is. shes made a lot of dramatic major changes in her life very out of character for her, but now at least she seems like shes stabilising.

in the same time (within a month of this coming on), my 3 yr girlfriend admitted to cheating on me with our mutual friend and wouldnt break up with the person she was cheating on, but begged me to stay anyway. i was also relapsing with mono and physically could not get out of bed or go anywhere for a long while, in pain and feeling miserable every day. i was diagnosed with chronic ebv and also had a ct scan done which prompted a multiple sclerosis diagnosis. it was very stressful and im still not physically recovered, or emotionally.

but the thing is, for the whole year last year (these things happened in the first quarter of 2018) i was initially very upset, but then dealt with it quite well! i didnt feel like i was pushing any of it down, i was genuinely dealing with things in a healthy way and felt very very confident despite shit hitting the fan around me everywhere. i felt like this up until a couple of months ago... where i suddenly stopped feeling ANYTHING. i have been dx with borderline personality disorder for quite a few yrs and as anyone else with bpd knows, we only EVER feel too much. so suddenly feeling nothing... i thought it was just a seasonal depression, but this past month, it acutely got so much worse. and ive finally snapped.

i have never physically self harmed in my life, but i tried every knife in the kitchen on me last week during my initial big breakdown, and ever since then, i havent felt myself at all. life just looks so pointless, even though i know logically that doesnt make sense. i dont abuse substances, but today i took a pretty big dose of nyquil on purpose because i am allergic to acetaminophen, a big ingredient in nyquil, and luckily i didnt take enough to go into anaphylaxis but it did hurt to react. i feel nothing still. nothing i like is making me happy.

therapy is not helping. it feels like its doing the opposite, really, and i have no other real support system other than friends who absolutely do not understand whats happening to me or how i feel, so its like me screaming and them not knowing what to even say, which is understandable. i want to get private help because i know im going to die, i know im going to just keep doing dumber shit, but i think back to when i was hospitalised for just a WEEK when i was 18 or 19 and put in a shitty institution with no insulation in the winter where i was crying and freezing in bed with people who were very violent and aggressive, had to be tranq'd to go to sleep every night, and the only help i got was a missed diagnosis and some meds and being too scared to continue treatment there. it was involuntary commitment, but i wasnt as bad as the other patients so they let me go. i dont want that experience again. every non-private (? like one thats appointed to you) mental hospital i know of around my area is like this, and i wish i could get private inpatient help or something. i dont know what to do. it also cost 10k usd for the shitty week stay, and i dont think my insurance will cover anything. i cant afford something like that. i dont know what to do anymore, and i dont want people telling me that they know how i feel. i know im not alone. i just wish i could be so i could disappear already, but i also want help. im sorry if any of this is dumb or sounds mean or stupid. ive brought up these concerns with my therapist and she says the only way i can really be helped now is if i get that special sort of treatment and i feel so stuck!!! why does it cost so much just to keep someone as worthless as me alive. why didnt i snap like this last year when people still felt bad for me?",10Feb2019,1
83,"Hey everyone. 

I need some help. First some backstory.
I suffer from sever depression and anxiety. I live in India and went to college in the US. The end goal for any student going there is to get a job there. 
For one, you want to make up the ton of money you spent to get your education. 
Secondly, the standard of living is just so much better there. It is just a better life.

Even though I did well in college, my mental health prevented me from landing a job mostly because I didn't try very hard. I was partially hospitalised around the end of college and engaged in self harm, suicidal ideation etc.

Now I'm back home working long hours for little pay. And the guilt is just eating me up. All that money my parents spent on me was wasted. All the time and energy I spent to have a better life was for nothing. I will never be able to make it up. I miss the life I had there. 

The guilt is the first thing I feel when I wake up and the last thing I feel before bed. I don't know how to deal with it. Therapy hasn't helped much for this.

So my question is, how do you guys deal with the guilt of missing out on an opportunity because of your mental health? How do you deal with the fact that our issues can prevent us from achieving what we truly are capable of?

84,"Pardon the text wall, right now I'm just in such a state that I've got to get this out in a public fashion. Maybe someone out there can provide some guidance, otherwise I may just have to give up.

I do not know how else to put it except that when it all boils down, I feel trapped by life. Work, family - everything to this point. 
My real father committed suicide 4 months before I was born, my mom was 41 and the rest of my siblings were already out of the house. Mom remarried a Christian minister when I was seven. Extremely religious family, very strict and isolated upbringing. Homeschooled. Forbidden from dating. I wasn’t encouraged or helped to look into higher education (despite wanting to pursue). 

I was the odd one out in my family, once I was of an age to start thinking for myself and form my own views and ideas. I am not religious whatsoever. In fact, due to the position of my immediate family it was always blatantly obvious the hypocrisy of it all, which made me want to further distance myself.

That being the case, I threw myself into work. It was all I had, first the early odd fast food jobs – due to high work ethic quickly becoming managerial. I met people who introduced me to alcohol and partying. I had friends! We partied and had amazing times together. Probably during this time, I started to rely on alcohol for coping with things because I wasn’t otherwise equipped due to my upbringing.

Finally was able to get into a career in IT after a couple years once getting some certifications. After a particularly bad experience at my first long term job (6+ years), I was fired for no fault of my own. Drinking continued…

A friend got me a job for a company doing outsourced IT, I crushed it – quickly gaining responsibility and trust due to my work ethic. All the while, not realizing that as time went on I had to compromise myself. Boss telling half-truths to clients, not able to talk plainly about things occurring, underhanded business practices. Coupled with the insane stress of the job, and becoming practically on call 24/7 365 – I start to turn more to drinking as a coping mechanism because I didn’t know what else to do.

After having tried to adjust in order to better things actively since late 2011, early 2012 things have only gotten worse. I drank a lot in the past to cope; it was my ""reset"" button: reach the end of my capability to deal, get drunk as hell/recover over weekend and face the next week.

I've always hated myself and my life for as long as I can remember. Part of that was my self-image, being an obese individual and having gone through many different things to try to lose weight - I tried another, Medifast. Great success after 10-11 months - went from 293 lbs. to 192.

Opened up more socially, started actually having good interactions but it fell apart. During this time, this was the first I tried medication - Dr. prescribed Pristiq, which seemed to help a lot except for ratcheting my anger to insane levels. After a particularly bad incident with a coworker due to it, I quit cold turkey.

Things spiraled more out of control near after. Step-dad got very ill, and I dealt with some severe pain/ability to get around during that time. He passed away about 6-8 months later, and things go more downhill from there. While my step-dad and I didn't have a great relationship when I was growing up, there was mutual respect and our relationship improved after I was out of the house. He had involved me in his wishes for after his death. He had a will so I assumed all was accounted for there as well. Once all that started to go through the process, unfortunately realized some of those things he had only expressed to me verbally so his real children paid that no mind.

My mother suffered during this and due to this as well; in turn it hurt me more. I also had to deal with my own sister acting like a petulant child during this time due to some severe offense she had with my mom and step-dad (she is like 20+ years older than I).

I began to drink more; I didn't know what else to do. Obviously, this started to take more of a toll on me physically and mentally. All the progress in weight loss began to poof away. As I was already a person with low self-esteem/confidence and self-loathing, this obviously did not improve.

Here I sit now, some 8 years later... after a bad drinking binge in April 2018 I decided I needed to truly give a real try to improving my life and I would only be able to really do this completely sober. I haven't had a drop of alcohol since, 306 days now.

Having tried more therapy with no success, and again tried medication route (which left me even worse off again, and with even less respect for majority of the medical profession as my experience is they don't care/give a shit and just want paid). 

I sit on the precipice now, my career has had me trapped since I started; I've just been used and abused due to my work ethic - I'm completely burnt out. My family has me trapped, my siblings are distant and my sister causes me much grief. My mother is worsening with dementia and I don't know how to handle this, I have to limit my interactions because it hurts me.

My life has been a ridiculous shitfest from the get go. I want to die so badly, but I haven't been able to take my own life. I'm so tired and I'm reaching the breaking point. I don't know what will happen and it scares the fuck out of me. I wish I could just cease to be, have never existed.

His parents don’t take him seriously, cancelled his therapy after one session, and he seemed distressed by his own behavior and thoughts. Poor kid told me he was on Prozac and sleeping pills which I’m sure are making him feel more numb. Some of what he said sounded like severe OCD.

All I know is that he lives somewhere in Canada. I directed him to the Canadian version of the crisis text line I’ve had success with, gave him a link to an article about intrusive thoughts, and suggested using Calm Harm instead of hurting the dog or looking at disturbing things, then blocked him after I felt he was genuinely going to text the line.

88,"Hey folks,

So this is a long time coming and I really haven’t told this to anyone, at least not with this level of detail, but I’ve gotten to the point where I want to be able to at least name my demons or have an idea of where I can start looking for those names. I’d seek a professional opinion but where I’m located (rural Nova Scotia, Canada) mental health services are difficult to come by, like 6 months to a year long waiting list if you’re lucky. 

For as long as I can remember I’ve always been able to compartmentalize my emotions, put them aside, and keep it to myself. I don’t know if this is something I was born with or if it developed as a response to the relentless bullying I experienced throughout my early life but at this point it’s a subconscious reaction that I don’t even realize is happening until afterward when I realize that a situation that should have made me angry or sad didn’t. 

Since I was about 18 or so I’ve noticed that this reaction had become less and less necessary as I just don’t feel anything, now it’s at the point where I’m conscious of what I _should_ be feeling, what most people would feel, but it’s just not there anymore. 

I’m also very empathetic, I can pick up on other people’s emotions very easily. With this I’ve found that without even thinking about it I leverage this to best suit my needs. 

For example: I’m on a date with a girl and she opens up about something I sympathize, console, then while staying on topic slowly guide the conversation in a way where I appear to be exactly what she needs to move on from whatever hurt her. 

Another example: I start a new job and as I’m getting to know my new coworkers I keep my conversation neutral until I pick up on their personality then I start to mimic and in a very short amount of time I’m getting along with everyone. (I actually did this once and within 6 months I went from entry level with no idea to what I was doing to regional manager) 

I seem to have this tendency to make myself a blank slate and project onto myself a personality that the other person wants to see. Lately I’ve been much more aware of this and am starting to realize it’s why I have very few meaningful relationships in my life, and it’s also likely why I’ve never settled down into a serious romantic relationship. It’s not uncommon for me to be messaging 3-4 women simultaneously, picking up on their emotional vulnerabilities, and using that to work towards casual sex that I can walk away from without any personal attachment. Just writing that makes me feel like a fucking predator but I don’t have a malicious bone in my body and would never physically harm anybody, I’ve just become more aware of my habits and am realizing that my behaviour isn’t healthy for anyone involved. I know these things cause untold emotional scars on people so that’s why I’d like to put a name to whatever this may be so I can work towards becoming a less terrible human being and maybe even start building some real relationships in my life rather than just using people and moving on. 

This wasn’t an easy thing for me to type out because it meant taking a long, uncomfortable look at myself in the mirror but I’m tired of this veneer I’ve been wearing as skin and would like to actually look the real me in the eyes for once. Thanks everyone.

It was way worse harder to control as a child but I now try to take sometime and think about my words so I don't do this but even then somehow it still happens.

90,"Hi All,

So recently I did dry January and I've now noticed every time I have even a few drinks I'm waking up the next day with quite intense anxiety. I'm not sure if it may be linked a little to having seasonal depression. I'm from Australia but live in Wales and do find the winter here a bit intense.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that the obvious answer here would be to just stop drinking, and I truly am considering it, but I do enjoy going out with girls and having the occasional beer at home. I wouldn't consider my alcohol consumption to be excessive. I just want to be able to enjoy it without worrying about how I'm going to be the next day.  


If anyone experiences this I would really appreciate how you've coped and managed or just any advice in general.  


Thank you.

91,"ill preface this by saying im 18, im a female, i just took a non prescription xanax to help with the anxiety im having right now (i dont abuse them anymore) and im feeling very depressed 

&amp;#x200B;

im really sorry. i dont know exactly what im sorry for, but im sorry im me. 

i want to change and do better but i dont know how. for as long as i can remember its been this way. 

i hated school so much. i felt like an outsider. i remember in 1st grade we had free time to draw whatever we wanted. i drew myself crying and i took it home with me. my mum questioning me on it and made the assumption i was getting bullied. 

she transferred me to a different school. i was teased by the other girls there. i used to hide under my bed every day before school, mum would call dad over and they would physically force me to attend. i pretended to be sick every day, i would try and force myself to vomit. sometimes i could.

my mum transferred me again but the bullying just got worst and my lying to evade school did too. i developed insomnia and mum couldn't handle it. she'd lock her door at night so i couldn't get in. i used to sleep next to her door and cry myself to sleep.

i cant really blame her for being so distant and cold to me. her dad was murdered when i was 7 weeks old. i dont think she was able to develop a connection with me.

my main bully lived with us, because his mum was my mums bestfriend needed help so he came to live with us for awhile. he sexually and physically abused me. 

my school counselor told my mum that he couldn't see anything happening to me or any real problem with my mental health.

so much happened to me that you guys don't know, but i know im sorry i need to stop making excuses. i fucking know im just searching for attention. i think it might be because no one validated my feelings as a kid. 

high school was a fresh start, i wasn't bullied there. i was actually pretty popular, but my hate for school never left. this made my mum resent me because we always argued about it. thats when i started abusing valium. 

i overdosed multiple times but no one knew, they just thought i was sick. as a vomited everywhere at school. but mum wouldn't let me come home, because i was ""lying"" just like i did when i was a kid. passing out on my desk but i was just ""tired"" from staying up too late.

she made me stay with dad sometimes, who was even more depressed than i was. i watched him cut himself. i watched him abuse drugs. i was so sad. i wanted to make him better.

mum laughed at me when i told her i was suicidal. 

when i was 15 years old i overdosed. i didnt want to die, i wanted everyone to understand the pain i was in. it was 5 days before christmas. everyone was angry that i had ruined christmas. i spent 3 days in hospital when i was let out on christmas eve. dad didnt even get out of his car to come see me and wish me merry christmas, he drove back to his house with my brothers because i wasnt stable enough to leave home yet.

i stopped using valium after that.

i was raped that year too. but thats one thing i dont like to describe in detail.

i dropped out of school. i couldn't do it, i couldn't face the world.

i tried to study, i tried to work. but i couldnt do it. i barely completed my two certificates with a less than 50% attendance rate and dropped out of my third. i quit 2 jobs. i just couldn't do it and im sorry. i know you all want me to be better but i just don't know how.

then 2 years after that when i was 17 my step dad who i thought the world of admitted to having sexual feelings for me. it ruined me, more than anything previously to that.

i guess thats when all the drug taking really kicked in, it makes you feel the best for the few hours you're high, but when you come down its just so sad realising how shitty life really is. watching everyone around you who is also using come down too, remembering things arent really as good as they seem when you're high.

im really sorry to everyone, to my boyfriend who told me that i need to stop making excuses. thats all im doing right now isn't it? im just making excuses. because i just don't want to live, i dont want to work, i don't want to study, but i dont want to hide in my bedroom anymore either. i don't really want to die either, im just existing. and its painful. 

mum keeps telling me im a burden. she says ill end up like dad.

i know other people have it worse than me, i know that. im just weak and i can admit that. i want sympathy, i want someone who will tell me that my feelings are justified. but what would that even achieve? 

so im just fucking sorry. i feel like an inconvenience on everyone. how am i supposed to break out of that? ive seen 5 psychologists now. 2 psychiatrists. im going to get a referral for my 3rd psychologist on tuesday. 

im just fucking sorry. im sorry for feeling bad for myself. sorry for self-loathing. sorry i couldn't give my life to someone more deserving. 

&amp;#x200B;

im so so sorry. i just cant see myself living in this world. maybe its not for me?

&amp;#x200B;

\*Also, very sorry for the lack of grammatical structure here, I wasn't exactly in my right mind while writing this\*

&amp;#x200B;

Dear \_\_\_\_\_,

&amp;#x200B;

  

I’m at my whits end. I’m getting to the point where I can’t deal with it anymore. You treat me like dog shit. I am your punching bag \_\_\_\_\_, everybody knows it, I know it, you know it, \_\_\_\_ knows it, \_\_\_\_ knows it and so does everyone else in this friend group. You have selected me as your target, because you know that I’ll take it. You didn’t chose \_\_\_\_, or \_\_\_\_, or \_\_\_\_, or \_\_\_\_, or \_\_\_\_, for a myriad of different reasons. But it’s a lose lose for me. You chose me as your punching bag, because I will just sit there and take the punches, and I’ll deal with it, I won’t say anything, and god for bid if I do. It’s a lose lose because either you give me shit, I don’t say anything in response, and you just continue giving me shit due to that fact, or b, you give me shit, I try to fight back, and you tear me back down using your emotionally manipulative sociopathic mind to rip me to shreds, and just continue at infinitum. Your excuse for always beating up on me is that “you’re always the one fucking up” or “I give you shit because I know you can take it” or my personal favorite “you never fight back”. You’ve called me a pussy, in front of everyone, and then explained why you think that of me, by telling me that I always take the easy way out.

I don’t know what happened in your childhood \_\_\_\_\_, I wasn’t there. Sometimes in families with multiple children, the youngest is sometimes left out, gets the least attention, that can hurt. Sometimes older siblings can gang-up on the younger sibling, always giving them shit, no matter what they do, that can really suck, and can leave some real emotional scars for a person. If that’s what happened to you, I’m truly sorry, but the growth comes from moving on after shit like that. And you haven’t.

Growing up, my Dad has been a manipulative, scrutinizing piece of shit, he still is to this day, always has been, always will be. And every day growing up, he would pick me up from school, and lay into me about how much of a piece of shit I was, and then I would apologize to him for making the mistakes that caused him to say those things to me. It was abuse, it still is. But I’ve moved on, I pledged to myself that I wouldn’t be like that with my friends, or family, or to my future children. You are just like my father. Every day, I get in the discord (**\******editors note - discord, for those who don't know, is like skype, but not shit*****\***) and spend the day listening to “jokes”, always towards me. I hear about how much of a piece of shit I am, and how every loss in a game we’re both in, is ALWAYS my fault. The night always ends with me closing the discord, saying goodnight, and thinking about why I talk to you, why I sit there and endure your attacks every day of my goddamn life. It’s abuse, it’s emotional abuse by somebody I should be able to trust. You’ve used that excuse many times “you’re always the one fucking up”, it’s confirmation bias (\****another editors note - just google it\*)*** for yourself, you’re saying this to me, but you’re really saying it to yourself, you only focus on when I make mistakes, not when anybody else does. You do it to confirm your own actions as valid, to absolve yourself of any blame of the psychological damage you’re causing me every day.

There’s something about you that you hate, something that you despise about yourself, nobody but you knows about it, it’s hidden, deep, in your brain, nagging at you, reminding you about its presence, and you need something, someone to tear into and rip apart to make yourself forget about that little thing nagging in the back of your head. That person is me. I’m your coping mechanism, you treat me like shit, beat me down, constantly, to make yourself feel better about yourself, and you tell yourself “he’s always the one fucking up, I’m just telling him about it, this is justified”. You’re using me, as nothing more than a way to deal with your pain, your past, your experiences of sadness, your inability to attach to others, the inability to care about others, is all shoved down and forgotten about by attacking me. And it hurts. It deeply hurts me.

But if I was out of the picture, you’d just find someone else to latch onto. I am convinced now, that you have never liked me as a friend, you don’t respect me, you don’t like me, you don’t care about my concerns, my fears, my wants, my needs as a human being, you think of me as a lesser being to yourself, you are more important than anyone else in your life. If I died, right now, as I’m writing this, if someone walked into my dorm room and blew my head off with a shotgun, you wouldn’t even bat an eyelash. You would just forget about me and find someone else to bully. I don’t care what you say to me, nothing will change my mind about this, because I know it’s true, and so do you. But you don’t care, you probably aren’t even paying attention to me right now as your reading this. You have no empathy, no feelings for others, you don’t have sympathy for other things, for example, you don’t care about animals, at all, they mean nothing to you, they are lesser to you in your opinion, and you respect only those that are equal or above you in your mind, this is why you respect \_\_\_, you like \_\_\_\_, you think highly of him. If \_\_\_\_ stopped joining the discord, you’d wonder and be concerned about him. But not me, I’m nothing to you. 

And yet, here I am, sitting in this discord, continuing to deal with the same shit, every day, and not stopping it, even though I know I could. I don’t know why, but I attach to people who treat me like shit. All I’ve ever wanted in life is for my dad to tell me he is proud of me. When I was in elementary school, there was a kid named \_\_\_\_\_, treated me like absolute dog shit, like I was the worst shit to ever walk the earth, and all I ever wanted was for him to be my friend. Every day, you treat me like shit, and yet, all I want, my deepest want in life, is for you to like me, to want to hang out with me and be my friend. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. But I finally see, I understand now, I understand that I seek the approval of those who have mentally abused me, because I have been trained to do so through my childhood, with my father, and It’s something that I will have to work through for the rest of my life, I know that now. You, ironically, are the first person I have brought this to. Just goes to show that I haven’t changed a bit, and I probably never will. So go ahead, keep treating me like dog shit, at least you’ll know that I’ll always be there for you to beat up when you need me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sincerely,

&amp;#x200B;

105,"So I've been dealing with panic attacks and anxiety for the past 4 years. It mainly started with my break up then eventual patching up with my partner of 7 years. He was my best friend but when we got back together I was extremely depressed. Eventually we broke up and I moved back to a city where most of my friends were.
Things were okay for a bit, then my anxiety started seeping into my sleep and I began sleep walking  again for the first time since I was a kid. It's a really foreboding feeling, knowing you were up but not being able to recognize anyone or anything. Most of the time this happens I'm drunk, so I began cutting back on drinking.
Then I started to see someone from work, someone I really like. I know relationships shouldn't validate your existence and no one person can cure you of anxiety, but it went away for a while and talking and being around the person kept the panic at bay. It was really nice
He broke things off, for good reasons on his end. He's a little younger than me and had only started seeing me after about a week after his ex cheated on him so I get that he needs time to be alone. But I hear him going out and getting so drunk he falls over and all I can think about is helping and taking care of him. We still talk and see each other but I miss the affection. And in worry  lot about him.
Fast forward to a few nights ago, slept with a mutual friend of ours, I was drunk as hell. Now he's feeling guilty and I feel guilty.
Basically, my panic is starting to take over, it's been a whole day since then and I have only been able to keep down water and yogurt. I recognize that I probably need to quit drinking, at least till I get my mental health under control. I really wish I had insurance so I could see a doctor, I've never been diagnosed with anything, but this feeling of panic and intense fear has got to stop. I dont feel alive and just want to be unconscious, I'm not suicidal, I just want dreamless sleep

I was raised by a bipolar and narcissistic mother, my father just wanted to make her happy, I was sexually assaulted by a family member at the age of 5, and my entire life story is pretty much “it’s a long story.” 
I have 7 siblings, most have different dads, all older than me, they all hate my mom. I’ve been having panic attacks since the age of nine, along with the adhd that my mother refused to get me help with, which lead to failure in school and the whole “you have so much potential, you just don’t apply yourself.” from my teachers. I started self harming at fifteen, had a long major depressive episode, was hospitalized for a little. I battled my sexuality for awhile during this time too. I was uprooted from my life during this time and less than a year later experienced another long depressive episode with a little psychosis mixed in. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and all that and have been on every antidepressant in the book and none of them worked. after I turned eighteen I decided that since the pills weren’t working I needed to go to the Mayo Clinic to go to the mood disorder unit to seek other options because I felt my depression was treatment resistant. Of course, the way I did it screwed ke over. I ended up in some mediocre town’s hospital because mayo didn’t have a bed open, and they took me off the antidepressants and put me on a mood stabilizer. Since then, I’ve been ok. I graduated high school, got a job that I loved, stopped taking the pills. I moved 800 miles away from all the people I loved because my landlord wanted to sell my home, and now I am alone.

109," 

This is my first time posting on one of the darkest places on the internet, and also when I feel like my personal and public life are blowing out of proportion.

I have been focusing on trying to better myself and I have realized that one of the biggest hurdles in me discovering my true potential and worth is the fact that im attached to sadness way to much. Like, I would much rather remain hidden and under the covers, rather than fight and strive for my right to breathe. And because of this, its three years later and its getting really fucking hard to put my foot down and just abandon my past and just fucking put myself together. I could talk to a therapist, but in my college, there is only one therapist and she is the fucking worst shallow, narcisist thing I have ever seen. And very recently there was a suicide in my college, which explains how worthless she is.

I could talk to my friends, they have offered some soft advice but I don't open up to them about it entirely because they're mostly brickwalls, and I dont feel like i can trust them enough. I cant open up to them about this because this is too personal and embarassing. Im second guessing whether I should end my friendships but I also remember that they were there for me sometimes, so you see this is effecting my personal and public life too.

Its been three years and now its the final year of my college and Im panicking that I have not decided on where I want to go, not done something meaningful with my life. While my friends have atleast gotten into the middle of their self-deelopment because they atleast have an idea of where they want to go, I feel like I have barely even started because I feel scatter-brained, absent-minded all the time and wanting to just go with the flow.

110,"So I don't think generic therapy is good for me, I started my seeking help journey in August because years of (probably since age 10--now almost 28) just dealing has taken a toll and a half.
The beginning was rocky but helped me realize my bf at the time was toxic for ME, but I still cared about him but as soon as I took the step to decide to find the person who would make me feel all the reassurance I've needed and holy crap a miracle.

I have an extremely dependent personality and I feel l've made myself more than happy in my acceptance
Of my full self so I don't see my own need to get constant reassurance as a BAD THING. Someone would come by when things needed to and they did.

Granted the original therapist was ok; the next psychiatrist was ok; and my new therapist makes me wanna spill my guts and I leave feeling horrid for

I have been so scared of ""controlled substance"" type drugs for fear of seeing people in the past.

I'm just checking in to talk about an instagram page/blog that I've created to combat stigma against mental illness especially/including serious illnesses such as bipolar, schizophrenia, OCD etc called ""stupidity scares me"". I've just started it so it's still a baby. My aim is to show the public/society how we can be impacted by stigma and how it can make living life with already serious and debilitating illnesses so hard and to also educate.

I'm also looking for contributors to the blog, if you want to tell you story about how stigma has impacted you there is the place to tell it. I'm not a professional blogger or instagrammer by any means, this is just something that I am passionate about. I hope you guys will check it out and happy Sunday!",10Feb2019,1

116,"My father passed away on September 2nd, 2017. Three months later, in December, my mother had surgery.

She was diagnosed with hypertension and dyslipidemia post-op, and because of this, we had to purchase a blood pressure machine to track it at home. I started to measure my blood pressure and heart rate pretty much every single day in the months from January - April of 2018. Without being aware of it, I had begun to obsess over my health.

My health anxiety got really bad in April. I went to the hospital several times a month with chest pains, shortness of breath, dizziness, and tachycardia. It got so bad, that I didn't leave my bed for 4+ months (October '18 - present).

I was obsessed with my heart and absolutely convinced that I had some sort of cardiovascular disease, and that I was going to die at any moment. Finally, on January 3rd, at the very beginning of the new year, I guess my brain finally gave in.

I have now been experiencing permanent derealization and depersonalization for over a month, which is driving me to the very edge of insanity.

From what I've gathered through anecdotes and research, disassociation is a protocol which is activated by your brain in order to protect you. It is the brain's natural response to having been over-loaded by fear and anxiety for too long.

Does anyone have a similar story of developing DR/DP from their general anxiety/health anxiety gradually becoming worse over time?

I often play a videogame called Overwatch and sometimes I write something to someone in the public match chat (for example they're so good at the game and I ask them what their rank in the game is). And they are obviously here and they probably saw the message but they just don't anwser. They play, when they die ingame, or after the match in the score screen, they could respond, but they just leave without saying a word, or worse, they might respond to other people's messages but not to mine. The thing is, something so minor makes me sometimes instantly close the game or leave the match because of how angry I get. When someone kills me ingame I can get frustrated pretty easily, because i'm taking that personally too (my own mistake, or just being so close to killing someone else but getting killed first)

122,"I need help. I don’t exactly know where to go from here. My father (54M) has been showing signs of depression or bipolar disorder for many years. It has affected our family in that something very small turns into him becoming very angry and verbally abusing my sister, mother, and I. When I was 9, he constantly called me a loser because I wasn’t good at soccer or any other sport to the point of screaming at me on the field (we had just moved to the US and I had never played a sport before) and he never wanted to practice with me. He insults my mother because sometimes she mispronounces a word in English and calls her awful names.

He has a lot of issues at work. He has switched jobs every two years because he says managers hate him and want to eliminate his position. It has been the same argument at every job he has. I’m not sure how much is true. He is constantly applying to new jobs. 

He comes home from work and just lays in bed on his iPad or watching tv. All he wants to do is sleep and be in bed even if my sister and I are home visiting or a family member is there. He just quietly goes upstairs to his room. 

Over the past few years, this has gotten increasingly worse and he wants to spend his weekends drinking. My husband and I just had a baby and live in another state so when he comes to visit with my mother, he always suggests a brewery or winery and gets upset when we suggest another activity that is more baby friendly. He spends the weekends drinking and going out with my mother even though she does not want to but does it because she knows it makes him happy. When he drinks, he’s happy. It’s the only time we see him happy anymore.

Last night, my mother and him got into a fight and he said he didn’t want to live anymore. He said if he had a gun, he would shoot himself. This is my worry. I don’t know what to do to help him. He is a Hispanic man who grew up with the idea that a man must be strong and mental health is something that’s never spoken about and it may seem weak. He doesn’t believe in psychologists and doesn’t think anything is wrong. If there is something wrong, he believes it comes from an external source. It’s somebody else’s fault for making him feel this way. 

I am at a loss and I am worried about his wellbeing. He has become increasingly angry over many small things. He’s not happy and we don’t know what to do. We worry about him becoming violent because when he is angry, he has done this in the past. How can we talk to him to get help if he doesn’t believe in getting that help?

I’m 99% sure I’m not suicidal. I mean why would I be? I have pretty hard days, I’m depressed because my friends are, empathetic, narcissistic family members, etc.

I just want some solace. I’m going to a doctor within this week, very soon. A GP. I’m aware that unless if I genuinely make a suicidal gesture “I’m going to jump off a bridge”, the doctor will not hospitalize me. I’ve also had intrusive thoughts of violence, involving hurting/stabbing others. Obviously these thoughts are very distressing.

I think one of the reasons I put off driving for so long (finally getting my license soon, early 20s) is that I worried I would ‘go crazy’ and hit someone. Anxiety 101 huh? :P

Any solace friends? I get it, I ask for a lot of reassurance. The doctor won’t ask for specific intrusive thoughts, yeah? Just that I have intrusive thoughts that *distress* me is a hallmark of an anxiety disorder.

133,"My elementary school teachers were always telling to my parents “he is extremely intelligent but he is lazy”. I know that this is very cliche but please keep on reading. I was the “perfect kid” in high school with the best grades, sports, social life. People around me always praised me as I’m the brightest kid around. I have been told that a lot, however, that came with a lot of expectations. People were thinking like, this kid can manage everything he’ll face somehow. 

Currently, I’m at the first year of university. I had no problems adapting to a new country and all, but just around the last year in my home country, I had this girl issue(which is not directly related to my point of writing here but it might have changed some things idk). We had a thing, then she left, and I was heartbroken for like almost 9 months(I wasn’t able to eat and sleep properly, but still that’s not the point). After some time, I was kind of okay with this and ready to go to the university. But despite the people around me, I was feeling lonely and broken.

Then, as I said, I adapted perfectly to my new life, however everyone still had expectations of me getting the highest grades, going to a top tier graduate school, starting working and having a good life. 

To be honest, that’s my plan too. Well, definitely there are a lot to talk about but I can put the words together in here for everything. For example, I’m scared of getting old, I’m questioning why we exist because none of this makes any sense, I’m questioning the fakeness of the entire world and people, I’m questioning nobody really really loves you except your family(although you feel like it, I think, every relationship is SUBCONSCIOUSLY based on benefit-it might be materialistic or emotional- we all are getting our cut from our relationships)  and whatever you probably say that these are common thoughts, I’m just trying to give you insight. Meanwhile, I’m using our relationship(me and the person who is reading this) to relax myself by putting out my thoughts that I can’t share with anyone. I don’t mean I don’t have any friends or no one to share. I mean, people act like they are listening and they care, but at the end, no one really cares, and they would just try to consolate me and cheer me up.

Although I study hard, I failed all of my classes, and I think I have anxiety and depression. I sometimes sleep too much, sometimes I can’t. Every day I wake up, I don’t feel like going on. I am extremely anxious that I will fail again and end up like sh*t. 

I feel like a failure.

I am also feeling very lonely. 

I feel like there is no sense in all of this.

Not to mention I am scatterbrained, you have probably noticed if you have read until the end. I can never stop thinking about everything and I can’t even put words together and write proper paragraphs. 

I feel like nobody can save me except for myself, but I would like to hear what you might say.

He has a history of drug use but 3 years ago started taking this medication which is supposed to help manage narcotic dependence. I didn't know this was something he took until he let me know a few days ago that he would be ""going through the process of getting off these medications which would be like going through narcotic withdrawals."" 

The last three days have been really bad. He's broken doors, windows, is yelling and punching walls, is abusing Xanax and alcohol and is generally uncontrollable.

Because it’s like this whole time I’ve hated myself and then yesterday, I spoke to people who I hadn’t ever spoke to because I just assumed they didn’t like me, I told them that and they said “I always found you hilarious but didn’t think you liked me”, so this entire time we were both just restraining ourselves with the fear of not being liked when really, we both like each other, which makes me feel like I can just be confident in myself because most people I’ve met in my life, I found out yesterday really fucking love me for who I am. I don’t know whether I’ll feel different tomorrow but one things for sure, I’m always gonna remember that night and this post, and try to apply my new perception of life and confidence and happiness to everything I do. 

Basically I’ve just realised I’m not so bad after all.

If anyone is wondering about trying it, do research on all of it so it’s safe and once you’re aware of the safety precautions etc, just fucking do it, it’s incredible.",10Feb2019,1
142,Something horrible happened. I cannot remember the last 2 hours of my life and when I became myself again my beloved hamster was mutilated and hacked to pieces with an ax. I have no recollection what happened. Please halp,10Feb2019,1
143,"I always think about the elements that make up who we are - the experiences that we've had in our lives that cause us to have certain traits or habits or patterns of thinking. I had a lovely life growing up - sure, the normal dysfunctions of any family and the  common challenges that any teen might experience. But I was blessed. 

Entering into my first kinds of relationships I've noticed that a lot of the guys I go out with keep asking me about 'my past'. A lot of them assume that I've had some sort of trauma or abuse happen to me - but nothing like that has ever happened to me. 

When I started thinking about the cause of this, I reflected on other areas of my life. I have had my battles with depression and developed coping mechanisms through self harm in multiple fashions since I was seven years old. Again, I had a lovely life and wonder why I reacted like this? It seems like it's always been ingrained in me and at 20 years old, I'm starting to wonder if it will always be this way. It keeps coming back, becoming more debilitating each time, and I'm afraid that without knowing what causes it, I can't conquer it. 

**Does anyone else ever feel like there is a part of their lives or themselves that you've blocked out or forgotten but explains why you are the way that you are? Or am I really just the way I am for no reason?**

Any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Cheers. ",10Feb2019,1
144,"I struggled with depression, severe anxiety and eating disorders from age 10 to 19 approximately, and in those last years something here and there changed from time to time, a little cell, then a little thought, and with time I managed to get myself out of those conditions. My life is like sleeping with one eye open at all times, but that's not so bad since one of my personality flaws is having to have everything under control, so it's channeled in a positive way. It's been almost a year since I last felt like I was significantly improving my life. In the meanwhile I went back to college. All my colleagues are dying to get the job of their dreams and I just want to be more qualified. I just want to learn, I was never very ambitious and I was never focused on one interest alone. But there's somethings I want. To do, to go through...but I feel like I'm not going after them. I never really went after nothing, I've spent too much time being afraid of trying, of failing, of succeeding... So now that I'm proud of where I am, I start to feel like I'm watching a little child fragile part of  myself getting lost, and not knowing where to go next. Cause I'm not sure how I can be a more aggressively confident version of myself. I want to be more assertive and  impulsive.  When will I get that confidence and energy  everyone has?  Others attitude is  ""I'M HERE, I KNOW THIS, AND I'LL DO IT' and I'm just..."" I'm here, I'm doing this...yea I know it"". Further talking would get more confusing. Do you have any idea of what I'm talking about?  I wrote this with a migraine so it's probably fucked, sorry",10Feb2019,1
145,"sometimes i'll go through a 1-2 day episode where i am hypersuicidal (more so than usual) and can't really think straight. i move around a lot (like jittering my leg), get the urge to laugh/make noises, and have maybe a little more energy than usual. it's also accompanied by a constant anxious/excited i guess feeling. is this mania, or is it something else?

147,"So I've been really stressed - like out of my mind stressed. I'm 18 and in college, about to finish up my two year in business (I'm also a guy if that's helpful). I have two projects I'm working on right now (work, not school). One of those I am leading, the other one is entirely my own. I have this annoying wart that's been on my hand and won't go away (I've used medication and it still sucks - can't shake people's hands, so I've been hugging more than normal - being in business and not being able to shake hands is terrible).

There are flees in my room that won't stfu. I'm mostly sleeping during the day (except for classes, if I make them) and working/procrastinating during the night. I'm trying to stop playing video games (slow progress, but it's ending). Watching too much porn (I'd rather not be watching any, and I'm struggling to end that too).

I have way too many friends, and I never see them. I love talking to people and I am VERY extroverted, but I always feel unprepared (and usually am), so I'll just avoid seeing my friends. I have been talking to a girl but she's in Florida (I'm in Washington). We like each other and decided we'd just be friends for 2019 and work on ourselves (it was mutual - our relationship isn't really sexual, we just really enjoy talking to each other on the phone - talking to her usually de-stresses me).

Because I am not seeing people (how I get my energy) - I don't really have any energy. I've been trying to find time to listen to books (currently Jordan Peterson's ""12 Rules For Life""). Trying to maintain a workout schedule (I'm skinny but I'm good looking and good at basketball/baseball/track - it's not that I'm insecure about how I look, I just want to actually be healthier). I still think about this girl that dumped me over a year ago (not all the time or anything, but I'll get reminded and it's weird idk - I thought that'd be over in a year lol). I'm not eating that much, I never have (I'm NOT anorexic).

I hate planning and scheduling. I'll check the news too often and have political conversations with my dad (I like politics - btw I'm a liberal conservative in case you were wondering). I love hip-hop/rap (old-school 90s - some R&amp;B - Fugees, Eminem, The Roots, Mos Def) and I'm a very talented lyricist and writer. I know people in the Seattle rap scene that I've been wanting to record/perform with but I can't find the time. I like listening to that type of music but every time I listen to it I want to sit down and write or freestyle (or just dance), so it gets to the point where it's not enjoyable just to listen to because I want to apply it, and I can't because I don't have the time.

My current two projects are at the point where they are producing, but all the cash goes right back into the business (or needs) so I don't really have any extra cash and I'm very reliant on friends/family if we're hanging out - which I hate because it just makes me look like a dick - which I don't normally mind, unless I'm hanging out with real friends/family, which I try to, because why would I hang with fake friends/family? I'm also trying to study for my permit so I can somehow get my licence and somehow save up and get a car (or have a fellow mentor perhaps lend me one).

When I am at school and nearly forced social interactions - I'm addicted to people and will make new friends that I don't have time for (which makes me feel stupid). Some grandparents are dying that I've been relatively close with (see what I did there?) and it's just hard having people that could just be gone tomorrow. Really amazing people. My grandpa was in WWII and escaped three enslavement camps (I'm 50% Polish).

I just don't know what do. I'm in despair. I don't know what anxiety attacks look like, but I'll get to points where I just randomly start shaking and making the kind of noises one makes when they see they got a 27% on their math exam. I've had suicidal thoughts (not so much out of depression as they are out of just the sheer amount of stress on my brain, and how falling 300-400 feet headfirst onto concrete pavement could get rid of all that stress, and the stress that I don't even know about that would come in the future - I'm just 18 - I can't imagine what it will be like later on, or maybe I can).

Every single time I'm hanging out with people I just feel gray, and I see gray: ""There are things I need to do. I could be improving myself. Why am I doing this right now?"" Oh, and a couple realizations of ""Hey, we're all going to die one day"" - which is then immediately followed by thoughts of the future and anti-aging technology and what life will be like if I get to live longer but have to watch my parents die and a lot of my friends (because a lot of my friends are older 45-50+ - I'm weird like that I guess). I'm a Christian but I don't actually believe in an afterlife (I don't know how to literally believe in an afterlife). I'm a Jordan Peterson Christian. ""Christian apologist,"" right? I don't drink and I've never done any drugs, I like having a clear mind - at least I think I do.

Anyways, that's my situation. I know it was long but if you read this far I hope it was somewhat of an amusement for you and not just torture. Any help, personal testimony, experience, or advice that you have to give me would be very much appreciated. Thank you very much! I value your time and energy.",10Feb2019,1

149,"I'm a 17 year old male. I've been diagnosed with depression but I know it's more than that. Firstly, I have really bad nervousness (not gonna say anxiety because no diagnoses). I worry a ton, it ruined my last relationship because I convinced myself she didn't like me. I have a few social media accounts but I never post because of a fear of being judged. Also, I can't talk to people sometimes, I'm completely silent. Another alarming set of ""traits"" is an inability to really feel any remorse, violent tendencies, and inclination towards crime. I got in a car wreck a few weeks ago and the other person got hurt an I didn't feel bad even though I admitted and knew it was 100% my fault. When I heard she was suing for that I was pissed, although maybe that's normal for my age but it concerns me because that's not the philosophy I try to follow. Also, I do have violent tendencies, if someone annoys me I want to punch and fight, luckily I stop myself and also my fear of being judged stops me from doing that. For inclination towards crime I mean I already do some stealing, little things though, like candy and pens, maybe a charger from a friend if I lose mine, I don't feel about this and if I'm caught I just admit that I stole it and take whatever consequence I get, only because I can't sincerely apologize and a punishment makes people think I learn not to do it again. I do idolize criminals, I find myself fantasizing about being some kind of a successful crime lord, like actually thinking about the things I might have to do to make that a reality. Lastly, I really hate talking to people. I'm not good at it and people are so boring. They're not fun to talk to, I don't find their jokes funny, I don't find conversation interesting. I don't have a single person who I enjoy hanging out with, they're either boring, weird, annoying, etc. Even when I had a girlfriend it was boring, being honest the only reason I stayed with her was for sex and to be able to say I had a girlfriend, which I know is messed up, but I don't feel bad about it. I don't judge people, I admire them, I can't make jokes and carry an interesting conversation. I wish I could do it. Problem is, all these things aren't who I want to be, but I feel like it's such a fundamental part of my personality I can't not act like this. I really think that I will kill myself because I hate how I act. I hate how I can't enjoy talking to people, I hate how I never connect to people like I used to be able to, I hate being an asshole who lies and steals and hurts people without remorse. A couple of days ago a friend of mine called me for advice because some girl he was talking to said she was gonna kill herself. When he showed me what she said I laughed because of how she worded it. I stopped myself and apologized but I really didn't feel bad. I did not want this girl to die. Reading the message in the back of my head I told myself maybe it's for the best she killed herself because of her situation. Luckily I did give him actual advice on what to do and she decided not to do it and seek help. That being said, shouldn't I feel bad for this girl? Why don't I? What's wrong with my head? I try to be nice and helpful but I fail a lot and I fail horribly.",10Feb2019,1
150,"the title describes it quite well. I just don't know who I am anymore, not all the time actually but sometimes I get these episodes where I just think I am completly fake.

I'm gonna quickly go over what I have been through/who I am to give you a bit of an idea.

20 year old fem anon here who was bullied basically all her life, never physically but always excluded, trash talked...etc. etc. Don't want to get into detail here. However this got me to considering suicide when I was back in 4th grade, 8th grade was the worst. Decided best would be to kill off my emotions. Created an 'alternative personality' in my head. I tried to be him more and more and eventually I did hear him talk. He was seperate, inside my head, never could **actually** hear him. 9th grade it was bad, but got better. 10th grade was mostly fine, still horror, but eh. Way less bad, so I was good. Got in contact with a girl that was cutting and used to have anorexia. Told me about her therapist that had a client with dissosiative identity disorder (DID). Always had been disassosiating, completly getting lost in thoughts, staring into the distance and thinking up stories about my alternate life, built those stories so intricately that I eventually started to believe them. (example: what would I do if I saw a fairy and she'd grant me three wishes, took me months to get back into reality and convince myself back that that would never happen, since then I have learned my lesson and never think up stories with myself as the main char)

Managed to gain some confidence through meeting my (now ex) bf. His parents were psychologists so he did know how to help me a bit. Start of 11th grade. Told him bout my 'other one' in my head and my history. Spiraled myself down more and more, eventually started cutting cause...why not? Probs wanted to seem edgy (ugh. Why.) Stopped with that, he got me into BDSM...that went bad. Still have scars all over my body and I hate them every single day. Fixated myself around him, tried to make him like me, while actually being really repulsed about being in a relationship. I hated it, but I suck at saying no. So. That time my 'other one' got worse and worse, episodes where he took over my body, talked to me, talked with a different voice, I had black outs and later on woke up not sure how I got there. It was really fucking scary. Cutting actually stopped the thoughts. 

Two years pass, still with my now ex. Moved to him cross countries. Loved him less and less, blablabla, disrespected him because of how incapable he was (could not cut his own bread while still being condescending). I just wanted to break up but he had threatened before to kill himself, did it again and again. Threatened to kill my pet frog. Eventually decided to break up, he still came over all the time. Not gonna say he raped me, cause after all...at that time I did give my consent, true after each time I hated myself more and more and was extremly grossed out... this continued for a good half a year before I finally managed to move away. 

Still get seasonal depression, when I am stressed I hear my 'other one' again, but the worst part is the times when I just do not know who I am. I break down, start crying and think about all that has happened and do not know what is really me and what is not me, because after all...I probably just did everything I ever did because I picked it up from somewhere? Starting to cut because I knew someone that did? The whole 'other one' BS because I thought it was 'cool' or something? How much of me is fake and what am I actually? I don't really know, I just feel pathetic because if all of this which has defined me so much (as seen on my body as hecking ugly scars) is just fake? It's just...something I made up? Am I made up? I can't really put it in words, I hope you understand and thanks for the help in advance.

TL;DR: struggling with not knowing who I am anymore at times, just break down unsure of what is real and not. Pls help.",10Feb2019,1
151,So i have a really really great relationship with my therapist she is such a sweet person and i have been seeing her since may and for the most part i feel good leaving there and i get excited for my appointments but i feel like there has to be something better out there? She makes me really understand why i struggle with what i struggle with but she doesnt really offer me any like planning or strategies really especially with the biggest problem i have right now (heartbroken) and cant stop thinking about the girl im sad about which is causing me to have mood swings and depression. I also need a new doctor for meds too  I  feel like i cannot get the right combination of meds i have tried so many differint things over the last year and idk lol i wonder if the meds i have been on is the best it can get as far as feeling better.

152,"Hi, I have a loving family and very nice life but I cut myself because I can't deal with failure. Recently my grades have been slipping due to my own fault. I keep studying harder but it appears to do no good. I feel very upset and worthless at the moment because I have no skills other than studying, so once my grades drop, it's like I've wasted my whole life. This is my last semester of high school, so if my grades slip hard enough, I am very worried that colleges will revoke my admissions. I'm also ashamed of myself for being so dramatic over grades because I know people have far worse problems than I do.

153,"I have GAD (Generalized anxiety disorder) for about 2 years.  My psychiatrist established it. Now, i am able to function properly again and am happy again.

Aside from the standard problems of.. thinking too much, always feeling like you’re stressed out and some panic attacks.. i have one thing that is just annoying me.

I check if I’ve done something important at least two times. for example; at least three times if my bag is closed. I have to grab my zippers to make sure they’re closed.

Or, check another time if the lights are off.

And sometimes (and right now) I feel like if I went to sleep, I’d die because of something. And I’m doing everything I can for staying awake.
Most of me knows, that this is irrational and I’m not going to die (maybe only because of idk, a bomb), but a part of me is yelling that YEAH, YOU’RE GOING TO DIE BECAUSE OF AN UNKNOWN DISEASE YOU CERTANLY HAVE.

I'm told that people with that type of OCD never have a history of violence or anything like that, but in my case, if I was charged with every crime I have committed, I would have charges including but not exclusive to; kidnap, aggravated assault, assault with a weapon, firesetting, vandalism and more. I don't want to be violent, but often the way I feel makes me so angry (I think anger is right, I scored high with a therapist on identity diffusion), that I act aggressively.

165,"I need some help here. My mother in law is causing stress in my family. I am certain she has a mental illness and I'd like to do some further research. I'm not asking for a diagnosis, just to know what disorders may be consistent with this type of behaviour.

I've got a clinical background (speech-language pathologist) so I'm somewhat familiar with this stuff. 

First of all, there are multiple overlapping behaviours that point to: anxiety, ADHD, OCD, depression and maybe bipolar. 

I actually think her behaviour may fit with borderline personality disorder, or even histrionic personality disorder. 

She cycles through relationships with other people. These relationships usually end with her hating the other person and blaming them. She is ALWAYS the victim and never acknowledges her part in any breakdown. She hates her ex husband and bullies him a lot. Despite the fact they broke up, she is constantly at his home cooking, cleaning for him. 

She hates being alone. She is always either at our home or her ex husbands. She takes over with cleaning and cooking. She is very generous in many ways it then later will use the fact that she did these things as evidence that ""she does so much and sacrifices for us"" (playing the victim). 

All of her jobs (which are many and frequent) involve a colleague or boss that is ""out to get her"" and she frequently is not renewed (she contacts), gets a new job, or sometimes is fired. 

Most recently, she has turned on my wife and me. She is struggling with a job she hates and would come to our home and start cleaning and being really grumpy, muttering under her breath. It disrupts everything in our home life. We feel she takes over and acts bitchy. My wife has been telling her to leave when she behaves this way.

This recently caused a huge argument, out of proportion with the incident itself. She has been bullying my wife, messaging her and telling her how ungrateful she is, etc. She also turned on me and said some racist things about me which I have put up with because I know she is mentally ill. 

You can be sure that every 3 months  or so there is a crisis in her life. It includes blow ups of personal or work relationships, being out of a home, being fired, etc. She was kicked out of a restaurant for verbally abusing someone. 


Anyway, since she has now turned on my wife I need to step in as I've mostly bit my tongue when she has these manic episodes. But it's affecting my family. 

My wife told her she can't come around to help with the cooking and baby caring duties for a while. She had been over every damn day. She always finds a reason to come over. She cannot be alone. It was so hard to even get her to rent her own place. She was couch surfing for 10 years (""staying with friends"") before about a year ago. 

So this incident has turned into a huge deal. Constant texting about how she would never do that to her mother, she gave up everything to help us, etc. 

I told her she needs to come with kindness and focus on repairing the relationship, not blaming and victimising. I try to be very careful in the language I use but she has an inability to take any responsibility for her part. 

I've dealt with narcissists before and I'm starting to realise  that communication  with  her is  a similar  thing. Zero awareness on her part and an inability to reason. Arguements/discussions go around in circles and are exhausting. 

My wife is almost at the point of cutting her out of her life. I try to remind her that she is most probably mentally ill. I even suggested to then both that we book a psych. 

Anyway, I am sorry if this description is disjointed. I hope it describes the issue well although I'm sure there is a lot to info missing. 

What kind of disorders might that be consistent with? Any info would be appreciated. Ask questions if you need. 

I'm really desperately seeking a solution here and yes I'm pushing for her to see a professional but so far that was used against me as she said ""I'm not a psycho""",10Feb2019,1
166,"Serious question...

My mom divorced my dad 20yrs ago. My dad still considers them married in the eyes of the church. He still talks about her all the time, shares old stories and is convinced when they die they will be reunited in heaven.

She has since remarried. He has never and will never date or have another relationship.

Is this just a matter if religious belief and staying true to your beliefs, or is this a possible mental health issue?

My siblings are split on the seriousness of what's going on.

I would appreciate honest feedback. Thanks.",10Feb2019,1

I want to die so bad but I wish I felt different. I think I have no choice at this point.

169,"ive stopped giving a shit about what happens to me.

im not actively suicidal, im just drifting thru my life with no expectation of living it for very long.

i self-mutilate and self-injure out of sheer boredom.

(i looked up ""motivation to stop self-harming"" months ago and i saw a picture saying ""before, you cut, imagine what you'd look like with those ugly scars. now look at yourself without them. isn't that better?"" i sighed because i dont give a shit about what people think of my many obvious scars.)

i don't want an honest living and a family. i want to be left alone. if i can't have that, why bother? i dont see myself being capable of living happily in a world like this. we're just not compatible.

i constantly feel numb and empty and pleasantly stupid. my teachers all say im a smart kid, that i could be amazing if i tried. but i dont want to try anymore. i just want to draw and listen to music for a while and then go to sleep forever.

171,"I’m on medication for depression, and it helps me lower my anxiety too. But I can’t shake the feeling that there’s something else.

My childhood, my existence basically, has been full of medical trauma. Possibly other trauma. But a lot of my childhood I can’t really remember, it’s like in my head every day before this day didn’t happen. 

I’m struggling to understand if the way I feel is normal or not. 

I’m struggling with feeling like more really bad things happened to me as a child but I just don’t remember. 

I feel like I’m missing something, and I don’t know what to do about it. And I have a big problem with trying to look up things that I could possibly have, like DID. But I don’t really fit the criteria for someone with DID, yet I feel like I wish I had DID?? For some reason. Maybe just because I wish I had this better understanding of what’s going on in my head. 

How does a person know everything that they are and have been through is all of it? And not just a tiny portion? ",10Feb2019,1
