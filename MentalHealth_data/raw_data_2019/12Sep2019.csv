Every person matters. I've had anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. Podcasts like this remind me that there is always someone that needs help. It's up to me to ask.

1,"It's like 2 am where I live and i used to cry when I went to sleep almost every day because of overthinking about my parents and time and my friends and all those things,but today I stopped I did it,i started crying but I managed to stop instead of being 2 hours crying.
Yay :D",12Sep2019,3

3,"Little back story, was always happy annoying loud outgoing helpful motivated and everything good (almost seemed I was stuck in a manic phase my whole life), till one day I just woke up after a heavy night of drinking and everything was wrong. My heart would race anxiety was awful everything felt wrong couldn’t sleep anymore, motivation was gone, ptsd type thoughts came in racing my head, couldn’t get out of bed, nothing sounded good anymore, girlfriend helped the most out of everything I tried, my bowl movements changed, lost 20 pounds in weeks, couldn’t smoke weed anymore, just completely went of to a opposite person who I thought I couldn’t never be.

Been on:
Wellbutrin
Lamictal
Zoloft
Buspar
Clonazepam
Xanax

So I started seeking mental health. So they put me on Wellbutrin, I didn’t really give it enough time to really work but after a week it may have seemed to make my problems worse and suicidal intentions worse. So I stopped then lemictal did nothing. So then they tired. Zoloft after even the first couple of times it finally felt like that cloud was gone from above my head. But beeen using that for 5 months now and still I feel pretty awful it almost seems like I just got used to my problems so it doesn’t seem as bad as before. 
I just wanna know what went wrong and if you guys think you might have an idea what might be off in my head and maybe give some medication I could try.
(Benzos help me deal with it but do not help with it at all, even if I’m barred out I still feel like shit I just don’t care)",12Sep2019,1
4,"I am a 17M who has had a lot of mental trouble for the majority of my life. It is nothing severe (thankfully), but it hurts me still.

For years, I can not find enjoyment in anything. I’ve tried so many hobbies and so many activities. Nothing seems to “spark” with me. Not even relaxing makes me feel good. I don’t feel happy at all. Only video games have given me some enjoyment. In the past 3 years or so, it has gotten worse. I’ve had breakdowns where I just cry to myself (not a lot, a few). The only thing I find myself doing now is just passively watching YouTube or music. I want to do stuff; I want to be able to enjoy a hobby, at least. However, whenever I try to, I feel nothing. Nothing to keep me pushing forward. And when I do, there comes the inevitable mistake one makes, and I just get very close to said breakdowns. I’m nowhere near suicide, but I feel so depressed and emotionless all the time.

I’ve only tried talking to my parents about this a few times. There are times where I mention I enjoy nothing, and while they do seem concerned, nothing comes out of it. There was also another time where I came into tears with my mom about it. She did seem worried- I am not saying they don’t care. But, she just blamed it on hormones. That was two years ago. I’m still being affected by this.

What should I do? I’ve considered going to a therapist, but I don’t want the cost of it (US resident here). I also don’t want to add more costs to my family. My brother had to ride in an ambulance for something, which cost a good sum of money. My mother had to be in the hospital (for a personal reason), which also cost a lot of money. Then, my father had to be hospitalized for weeks because he got bacterial meningitis, which was also a lot of money. I don’t to add more burden. I also feel bad for talking about this. I see so many people posting they are “depressed” but are not, that I started believing that I am either faking it, or I am over exaggerating it. I don’t want to pay $1000 for a therapist to say that I am just a hormonal kid. What can I do?",12Sep2019,2
5,"I decided to room with one of my best friends, I'm really socially akward so thought it would make the transition to college easier, but honestly he doesnt really have any respect like I thought he would, he's even been treating me like utter dog crap too! Like he always calls me a dumb ass all the freaking time, even over the smallest things and it's REALLY annoying, and he's just been really rude and really inconsiderate too! Like at night he'll stay up to like 2 playing xbox with his friends, or watching youtube, which I really wouldnt mind if he wasnt so LOUD about it and when I try to tell him if he could turn it down a little, he just calls me a bitch. Also today, it was raining and I wanted the windows closed so my PC, which I built and was expensive, doesnt get wet and damaged, he called me a b*tch said the room gets to hot for him, opens the window then goes to class and as the dorm door is wide open yells that I'm a b*tch, now I'm afraid our RA and other people on the floor think I was doing something mean... I didnt think he would act like this in the slightest, I get that friends wont always get along, they'll fight, and poke fun, but holy cow I wasnt expecting this! I'm getting annoyed and really frustrated that he doesnt have any respect! Also earlier in the year, he said he doesn't care if my stuff gets destroyed cuz, I quote, ""it's not my sh*t, why should I care."" He also always tells other people that I met that I'm a dumb ass, a b*tch, and a lot of other stuff and it's getting really annoying... I'm afraid to try and change rooms cuz I don't wanna start any more drama then there already is... I think that I'll just have my parents take my PC back home when they come and visit soon since I dont even use it that much because of college anyways, and hopefully I make some new and better friends whom of which I can room with next year instead.

Final thing I think I should add, I treated him like he treats me, and he he got all depressed and mad as heck at me and said that I was doing it to be mean while he does it all sarcastically, which kind of screams hypocrisy... Honestly maybe I really am just a b*tch, and I really am just a dumb ass, but I dont care I just dont want my stuff to be broken...",12Sep2019,1
6,"I have been having a lot of vivid dreams that are so convincing I wake up assuming its real. And then by the afternoon I dont know if it happened or not or if its real. I'm abit unsure if this is a result of the abuse of hypnotics and blackouts so on or something other, I have diagnosed with possible delusions which I believe is a psychosis? Would they be linked?",12Sep2019,2
7,"I am 33 years old turning 34 soon, used to build websites using CMS but that business died, got fat and I fueled my online gaming addiction in the process as for the time it was easy living fixing desktop PC and building websites until that industry collapsed and transformed and I didn't keep up enough. Wasted my life doing an advanced Diploma in IT which I never used or didn't push hard enough to find a job when I could now the Diploma is almost useless. 

Ended up working in a company that delivers goods like sugar and doing hard manual labor, I am hated by everyone because I have a lot of education and am doing said job and people think I am stupid, lazy and spoiled for doing this kind of work. I saved my money in 2 years doing this work and paid to do a full 1 year HVAC course in a refrigeration school I also lost 50 pounds and feel much healthier and can climb easy now, I have 1 month before completion and now I am getting more hate from co workers. They tell me I will never amount to anything and I will waste my HVAC certificate like I did with my IT diploma. So much guilt I feel now you wouldn't believe it not even playing video games can take it off my mind

Then I got an anal fissure from constipation that is still ongoing after 8 months and lots of pain and no medication can cure it. But it is however easing up and is a lot less painful now tho I have to drink milk of magnesia every night and use an expensive cream. Who knew constipation could be so deadly? 

Then there is Karen, who is she you may ask? She is my cousin's ex wife she married my cousin in 2001 and they had 2 kids who are now 16 and 18 each. The guy she married was her first ever man she is a very nice and quiet person and very decent and kind, after getting married and moving into a room in the same house that he and his family lives her husband sisters along with his father started cursing Karen, taking her groceries etc when she wasn't home and tossing it into the trash destroying her personal belongings. She started spending her hard earned money to buy her inlaws things in the hope of them treating her better, this was a lost cause as they all wanted her gone as they were jealous of her success in life in both being pretty and an accountant. She bought a new pair of sneakers for her husband's father and he threw it at her when she offered him the gift then cursed her and they all banded together in that house to fuck up Karen's life. Karen's husband turned out to be a gambler and a drunk even tho he has a great job, he treated her so badly, so after 3 years of hell and 2 kids she packed up and left got a divorce and never looked back. The bastard husband didn't even care for her

Her same wicked father in law came with her son last month by us home here to visit and brag about his grandson's success as if he had anything to do with it. This triggered the memory of Karen in me and got me seriously depressed, even tho its 16 years since I last saw her it still pains me deeply to even think about what she went through, she used to tell me all what they would do to her when I would visit her when she was living there. 

I desperately tried to get into contact with her by asking a decent family member for her number, all efforts failed until her son gave her my number. This decent family member told me Karen won't speak to any of us no matter who it is but I wanted to try because last year Karen was missing and nobody cared to even inform any of us. 

Finally Karen messaged me 2 days ago I phoned the number immediately and told her how I wanted to know if she is fine and how I missed her kindness. She told me thank you but she also said right now she doesn't want to speak to anyone this is 16 years later she still won't speak to even me. I was in utter shock and disbelief but I also understood why she is the way she is now, she is broken and hurt beyond repair and who wouldn't be? I messaged her and let her know that I know what they did to her and I will always stand up for her character and name no matter what. 

She thanked me and said she is happy that there was still 1 good person from my family she said she appreciated the support. She then blocked me on wats app and now I know that there is no more tale to tell, it bothers me greatly not that she blocked me but that she is so hurt, the pain appears to transfer over to me in some weird way and I don't know why I feel so hurt and broken over what happened to her even after so long. An old wound shared for an old friend that I have not seen in a lifetime.",12Sep2019,4
8,"Hi all. the way I see it, if I was never born, I wouldn't care if I don't experience happiness. I wouldn't have a conscious mind to begin with. i wouldn't exist, and I would have never existed, so I wouldn't care.

to me, most of life is either mundane, painful, or not worth it. the happiness never lasts long enough and I can't do much to fix the world. 

I don't want to die, but if given the option, I'd pick ""go back in time and stop my dad from nutting in my mom to create me"" rather than ""keep living life as it currently is.""

&amp;#x200B;

people say that someone bored by our world is just a boring person, and that someone who sees all the bad is and edgelord, so since I don't want to die but rather would choose not to be born if i could choose that, am I normal? 

&amp;#x200B;

i don't long for it or anything. i just know i'd choose it if i could. life's joy isn't worth the pain to me. and then you try to tell others how you feel and they put you down for it. anyway, is that normal or a sign of something?",12Sep2019,1
9,"So I am a 14 year old (M) who is clinically diagnosed with OCD, anxiety, and chronic motor tic disorder. These are all problems that I have been experiencing for 10 or 11 years. I have been in and out of therapy throughout my life, and I have been seeing my current therapist for basically 2 years. However, I feel like it’s really not helping me. I don’t feel like I’m getting better and it’s costing my parents a fortune. They have been suggesting getting me medication, but I don’t want to resort to drugs if I don’t have to. I’d like some advice on perhaps some things I could do so that I don’t have to go on pills. I’d like to get better on my own so that I’m not reliant on medication for the rest of my life. Anything helps. Thanks.",12Sep2019,1
10,"I have this belief that my father and soon to be stepmother are neglecting me to the point of poisoning my food. I believe that they want me to become sick so that they don't have to deal with me anymore, and that they know I have a mental illness which they are exploiting. However, I lack any evidence of this and it all appears in my head. But it seems so real that I can't sleep without taking a benzo. If I don't take a benzo, I think about all the ways people want to hurt me. Then, during the day, all I do is walk around the house in agitation, without eating or taking care of myself. The stress has caused me to form chest pains, a cold that lasted two weeks, and like I'm about to collapse. 

I am seeing a counselor soon, but there's times where I feel so hopeless that I need to be hospitalized. What should I do to fix these problems, and what is wrong with me?",12Sep2019,1
11,"Today is a the biggest mental health awareness day in Australia so wanted to do my due dilligence and make the effort to spread this awareness far and why and contribute to those who need the support. So for you who are reading this R U ok? If you are I am really happy for you, if you're not please reply below and share your story.",12Sep2019,1
12,"Ok so over the last year I have become completely obsessed with the idea that I have a cluster B personality disorder, specifically Narcissism. This has come in tandem with increasing guilt and shame about my thoughts and actions from when I was younger. I have come open about these fears to some close friends and family and they have been completely reassuring that they don't think I am a not narcissistic, but I feel like maybe I just internalize it but don't let myself act out in a shitty way. I'm pretty sure I have empathy but now I even question if I really do. I'm maybe 8 sessions into therapy and my therapist has identified that I have had internal feelings of not being enough since a quite young age. Kindergardenish. I'm so terrified of being a horrible person. If it matters I have generalized anxiety disorder and some obsessive tendancies, and ADHD. I've been under the advice from friends that this is just an obsession but yet I am constantly identifying judgemental internal thoughts that are reflections of my own insecurity on others. I just don't want to be like this. I don't want to be a bad person but I'm so tired of the constant thoughts and anxiety. 

I also have some dependant tendancies and fear of losing my friends or pushing them away and being alone. I have commitment issues from a past relationship that was traumatic but have a minor obsession with finding a serious relationship before college ends because after that I feel like dating opportunities get scarce. However I also believe that I shouldn't get into a relationship because in reality I would be doing it for the wrong reasons and I might be a narcissist and I don't want to be a shitty partner. 

Has anyone else felt like this or have any advice? I've heard the whole if you worry you might be a narcissist then you aren't one but the DSM V doesn't say anything about lack of self awareness in it's diagnostic criteria.",12Sep2019,1
13,"Im struggling between believing that i have these problems and that im not depressed enough to be depressed. 

Whats going on with me. I got so angry over this i just gave myself a black eye. Fuck",12Sep2019,2
14,"A bit of past history: i'm currently 25 and have been displaying symptoms of clinical depression (diagnosed at 17) since I was 10 years old. Most probably triggered by a traumatic event that happened then. Since then I have slowly been developing symptoms akin to Bipolar II, which is the most likely cause of my mental health issues now. I have family members with Bipolar, and myself and other family members strongly believe my mother has it too but no formal diagnosis. 

In the past I have been seen by counsellors, CBT therapists and a small stint of EMDR (for Chronic fatigue syndrome). Other than the EMDR and 1 counsellor, the rest of my experience with mental health professionals was before I was 18. But that's not for lack of trying. I have been trying to get mental health help for years. I thought post-pregnancy I would have more luck, but instead I seem to be ignored even more. 

At 5 months pregnant I was deemed 'at risk' due to mental health. I had a counsellor through the pregnancy and then for 6 weeks post-birth. I was supposed to receive care at a local perinatal unit, but they conveniently found a reason not to have me in their care. But they wrote a letter saying I needed Secondary care due to long-term mental health issues. Weird how they said I need extra help but weren't willing to do so themselves. 

Asked my GP for referrals a few times, 1 referral was sent through to a short-term therapy centre who said they cannot help me as I am 'too complex'. That referral was closed. My most recent referral led me to my area's main hub for patients who need extra help with mental health due to long-term illness. I thought 'great, finally going to get help'. But instead I was told they cannot help me as I 'only have depression'. Apparently because I don't exhibit extreme euphoric manic episodes I cannot possibly have any form of Bipolar disorder. I literally tick every box for Bipolar II except for sexual interest... and been advised by other medical professionals that I exhibit clear signs of Bipolar disorder.

I was supposed to get a call back from that mental heath facility, but have heard nothing. I have rung twice (well, twice I've gotten through, usually it just rings for 10-15 minutes, and I give up) and both times they say they'll get someone to call back. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just tired. I have a 2yo little boy, a flat to upkeep, and a psychologically and emotionally abusive mother who I have to care for. And all the while I stay up until 3am+ either crying or zoning out for hours at a time. I'd pay for private psychological help but i'm not in a position to pay. All the charity mental health counselling either has a long waiting list or doesn't serve my area. I'm stuck as to what to do. 

I'm sorry about the long post, I suppose I needed to vent and I heard Reddit was the place to do that. I've just lost all enjoyment in my life because i'm so drained mentally. I want to give my son the best life, but how can I do that if I'm being a zombie mother who isn't really, fully there....",12Sep2019,2
15,"My friend has depression, pretty fucking severe depression too. Her parents know she’s depressed, they know she needs her medication. They’ve known for 5 years now (Holy shit we’ve been friends for 5 years) and they still fucking forget to get her medication for her. They can afford it, they just don’t get her medication. Its fucking annoying and abusive and I fucking hate it. I think its intentional too, because they seem to not buy her medication whenever she’s getting better, every fucking time. I hate this so much.",12Sep2019,3
16,I recently heard that if people say stuff about you a lot ots mostly true... and one of my friends calls me a dumb @$$ all the time and my other few just say I'm dumb or retarded... I mostly got A's and B's but I guess that isnt good enough... so how do I get smarter?,12Sep2019,1

18," I've been feeling really guilty about sharing my suicidal thoughts with close friends and family. But I feel like I can't really handle my thoughts sometimes. After expressing my thoughts, people try to make me feel better. Afterwards, I tell myself I'm bad a person for being emotionally manipulative; making my busy friends and family take time out to calm me down. Other times, I say my coping mechanism didn't work and I just needed help.

19,"Should I kill myself because?:

* I've always been really insecure and hated myself. I never had friends and don't have a single one now. I tell myself I'm a freak and a loser every day
* I'm angry and sad all the time
* I hate being Latino. I hate my Spanish name. I hate not getting better jobs, raises, or promotions like a white guy would
* I hate my parents. They're terrible typical Latino parents who never provided for me. My mom is a disabled mentally unstable abusive lunatic. My dad is an irresponsible loser handyman who never helped me financially in any way
* I hate being stupid. I think my intellect is so low and I always feel intellectually inferior to everyone else. I've been in the US for 13 years and still have a slight accent. I'm just too stupid to sound American
* I'm bisexual. I hate being a fag who has never related to real men. I literally only had 1 gay male friend and we're not friends anymore. I feel like such a freak whenever I see a guy and think he's cute. It repulses me.
* I hate my job. I'm basically an admin and work with all women (and have worked in all women environment for years). I work for a pharma company making $65/yr w/no benefits and can barely pay my bills (live in Boston- REALLY expensive out here).
* I feel so inferior to all my MD and PharmD coworkers (vast majority of them are these). They probably give all the good jobs to all the white guys instead of me
* I feel like no matter what I do, I'll always be poor and a loser bc I'm Latino and all the white guys and Asians take all the good jobs
* I do have a GF. She's a white Physician Assistant. She makes $110K. It's so humiliating to have a PA GF and you as the man basically be the secretary working with all women. It's so pathetic and degrading. Her parents are the perfect white family. They paid for her college and supported her completely. Mine couldn't even afford a roof over our head. Her fam is so typical white and mine is so typical Latino
* I have eating disorders
* I can't stop thinking of past mistakes or dumb shit I said as far as 10 years ago. The memories haunt me constantly and just remind me how stupid I am

I don't have a therapist and for the first time I've almost committed to going to a hotel and shooting myself",12Sep2019,4

21,"I often feel all alone in this world. I am alone in my sorrows, alone in the challenges that come upon me. I am bombarded and overwhelmed in life right now. 
Mentally I feel I really can no longer cope. Things have been going on for so long with no resolution and no break. I can't even feel happiness at the point. I live in fear. Fear of what is going to topple around me next. 
I sleep very poorly. I get headaches more frequently now and am plagued by crippling anxiety. 
Sometimes I can't even think right, I can't focus and I cannot remember. People ask me to do simple things and I literally forget. I have forgotten the dogs outside multiple times. 
I forget to get things out of the freezer. I forget to remind people when they ask. 
Then, I sometimes forget why I walked into the room. I forget my sentences mid conversation. I can't recall things I used to readily know.
Sometimes during these anxiety attacks by eyes start feeling so overwhelmed. I can see everything but it feels like I can't. There is crap everywhere and I just can't wrap my mind around it.
Sometimes I feel dizzy and I get the shakes.
I feel I always have to take a pee, especially after an anxiety attack. 
I have stubbed my toes and knocked my hips on items that have been apart of the building forever.
I have hypothyroidism. Now I have anemia too. I also somehow developed insane allergies that I now an constantly medicated for in addition to my allergy shot day.
I have very severe acid reflux confirmed on xrays.
I am so tired of everything. I am having to take 40mg of omniprezole, iron pills, levothyroxine, singulair and an antihistamine..usually zyrtec daily. On shot take I have to take xyzal and allegra at the same time and I feel so destroyed those days.
I have two ferrets, both with adrenal disease and both with insulomia. The males is very aggressive. I have to feed them multiple times a day and medication must be given every twelve hours. He fights me and usually decides to pee or even take a BM so it is a lot of cleaning.
My dog, my most treasured pet just got diagnosed with mammary cancer. Yay. I took her for tumor removal. They forgot the main one somehow so we get to relive all our fears again in addition to still waiting if it is benign or malignant.
My child has a speech delay and for some reason just cannot seem to recognize any letters regardless of diligently exposing him. He just started kindergarten and that has it's own stressors because of expectation.
My husband works out of town now. I see him for 6 days every two weeks and of those 6 days we usually fight for 4 of them.
In the past he has cheated on me. The first time when he was deployed. The second when I was pregnant. The third when I had our premature child. He never helped with a very needy baby. I was enrolled in 40 credit hours that year against my advisors judgement. He re refused to help me with the baby and it made me get two ds that semester because he would bot let me take my midterms. It took my GPA down to 4.48 so I lost honors. That last cheating charade, he spent 10k. I could not buy necessities at that point. I could not afford newborn childcare at 2k in the area and I was far from home so now help from family. This period tore out my soul, I dont think I ever recovered. During this period he was straight from an Afghanistan deployement. He came home and was abusive af. He would choke me, hit me a few times, broke my stuff, would hold me down and scream into my face. 
Then he would not allow me access to the bank account and trashed my perfect credit very badly. He then quit his job, and got the vehicle in my name repossessed. I have not recovered and now live with my mother since he travels. He is not physically or financially abusive, not even so much emotionally anymore but I have also grown not to care. I have a lot of resentment. 
I physically feel like shit now. I have gained 40 pounds in 4 years. That hypothyroidism has made it so hard to lose it. Now I feel fat and ugly. Yay. I hate myself so much. I am eating healthy however and will eventually get back to the gym when I actually have time. 
I am 29 now. I wanted to go to law school, I had so many dreams. I have nothing now. I am crippled. 
I would thing something was seriously wrong physically but I know the stress on me is probably causing it. I am alone in my suffering and I can't talk to anyone. I have no friends and my parents are condescending and very controlling.
I really need help. I need light and happiness in my life. I am in this tunnel of despair that I cannot seem to reach the end of. 
My mind is so absorbed in all these problems and failures at all times I can't even think anymore. 
Please help me. I am at my wits end.
I am in constant fear of what bad thing will happen next.
They say just crying helps but when I feel the need, my eyes well up with tears and then nothing.
I get angry very easily now, especially in traffic.
In addition over the years, some fucko tried to Jack me in a park. He only let me go because some people came down the path. Some other fucker, he was a friend until this, drove me to a deserted area trapped me in his car and tried to force me to have sex with him. I refused and he would not take me home, I did not know where I was and instead he took to dry humping me and groping me. 
At one job the manager was stealing my paychecks and cashing them at a liquor store, I was not even old enough to enter one at the time. 
Then at my last one they would clock me out when I was still working and my pay checks would come of short.
Some lady hit my parked car and completely crushed the side. Nope she never paid. The cops said it was a private neighborhood and they had no jurisdiction. She was a retired cop. 
Then some mechanic put coolant in my overheating car with it off and blew my gaskets. He then charged me 2500 to fix it. I was 20, what did I know. 
Then, I put all of my hard earned belongings in a storage locker. Someone broke into it and took every single thing. The cameras all just so happened to be turned the wrong way. They then used an old expired Id from when I was 16 and rented a uhaul then abandoned it when I was in Europe. So I cant rent uhals now. I was just married then and the money we saved to have a actual wedding went to replacing our necessities, we slept on a mattress on the floor for two years.
There are more bad things I can tell you all about but I will stop here since it is giving me the shakes.
I have a therapist. She sucks.

22,"Im in hospital due to my mh but theyve not made it too clear as to why.  Theyve diagnosed ocd, but say im here for ocd type symptoms and the same with low mood and anxiety symptoms.  In the past i was diagnosed with depression but again theyd talk about low mood.  The reason they give is that they dont want to give the wrong diagnosis but ive been here several months, the first month and a half on a section.  Also ive been told if im diagnosed theyd have certain treatments theyd want to try and for some reason they dont want to do it that way? I dont get it.  Wouldnt it be easier for us all to actually know.  It doesnt help worrying that theres nothing wrong with me and ive made it all up.  Doesnt seem normal and its making me more anxious that theres not actually anything wrong with me and all of this is fake.

23,"My mom is married to my dad for 27 years and their marriage is an unhappy one. My dad is abusive physical and emotionally. He would curse us and belittle us to the point that it may have affected our lives now. He also tends to be violent to my mom, us his children and other people like our househelper (if only I can type everything he did) and our family driver. He doesn’t help my mom in the bills, food or even education. He just spends his money on himself.  I think my mom hates him for that saying “he’s the man, I’m taking his role and this is how he repays me?” I’m not close to neither of then because of this. So, lately with that in mind, we realized he is a womanizer and a cheater. We didn’t know that or had any clue. We thought since he was getting older he was a changed man but he wasn’t. My mom caught him having an affair with someone younger than him. Then after that, all his women were revealed. He has had a lot, by a lot couldn’t count them anymore. My mom became paranoid and kept looking for clues and she kept starting a fight with my dad. Wherein he would react badly and hurt her, sometimes he would leave her shouting by herself. Since none of her tactics would work, she resulted to making a scene. One time she took a rope trying to hang herself, then once she took a knife and tried to stab herself with it, shouted at us she will leave in the middle of the night to “find her husband” then she wet herself with drinking water. She resulted to looking for the girls she knows and she kept telling them my dad is crazy and abusive and that they should avoid him. She seems obsessed with him even monitoring his whereabouts when he leaves our house even if with a friend. She would skip work just so she could come with him sometimes. 

They already went to a psychiatrist/marriage counselor but it didn’t help them, because my dad walked away when he didn’t like what the doctor said.  Also, my dad had been a long time patient with medications and was diagnosed with Bipolar 1 (we just knew recently)

What should I do now? Seems like it affects the whole family even my brothers and my daughter. 


Things I already did:
1. Talked to her about how I feel and what she should do. 
2. Suggested divorce or just calm herself somewhere else with me.
3. Go to a psychiatrist by herself (of course I’m accompany her.) 

She doesn’t listen to any of these. She just agrees then proceeds to do what she wants. I’m tired. I just want to make her stop doing this.",12Sep2019,1
24,"Hey guys! 

I’m currently sitting in the waiting room of my local emergency department for my mh and I’m struggling with some things right now and I guess I just needed to vent. I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD, depression and anxiety for a couple of years now as well as (chronic??) suicidal tendencies. 

The last couple of weeks have been really hard and I’ve started to notice signs of psychosis. I’ve been hearing things which aren’t there (alarms ringing. Dogs barking. Yelling and people calling out my name etc) as well as seeing things which aren’t there and having major paranoia. 
The worst thing about it is that I’ve never had these things before and I’m just scared about what’s going to happen. 

I’ve struggled with the things I’ve been diagnosed with for 8 years now so they’re familiar in a way?? I know how to react when they happen but this new territory is freaking me out. I’ve been waiting in a crowded waiting room for over 3 hours and I just feel like I can’t breathe. 

I guess I just need some comfort???",12Sep2019,2

My life has been decent lately, but I recently got dumped by my exgirfriend and I've just been kinda down in the dumps lately. I've tried to just lay down and let my emotions flow, but I don't feel sad. It's almost a numb feeling. I still feel joy and pleasure from life but I have no way to let my bottled up sadness go away. Now that I think about it, I haven't  really cried in a long time.

I was pretty depressed for a good 3 years of my life, I say this sparingly as it was undiagnosed. This last summer, I've felt better than I ever have. I was happy, in a good relationship, so I thought, and had a good paying job. This girl really messed me up. I feel like I should be sad, but I really don't.

Decided that was okay and took 3 trips to Pattaya. On my last trip it was the best trip of my life. I felt so totally and completely relaxed all I could think about was going back.

Then I met my GF, who is now my partner.

I had an opportunity to go back, I didn't take it. Jordan Peterson tells us we get more happiness from lots of little consistent spells on happiness, where Pattaya is one big hit of being happy and then it fades for the rest of the year.  

I am so damned angry I chose not to go to Pattaya while my GF was away but I knew that the risk of her finding out was too great so I didn't go but I can't shake the pull. I also felt like if I went, I would be back to square one and I would be craving Pattaya.

32,"A few years ago, I hit a dead-end of sorts. I was 18, ready to set off to a prestigious school, excited about life, and then I received a 'D' in Econ (my then major subject). My admission was rescinded and with a grade like that, most schools didn't want to take me. I was never super-intelligent or the over-achiever type throughout my middle and elementary school but I started working very hard in high school and felt like I was beginning to come into my own - which is why this debacle hit me very hard; my confidence, self-esteem, and self-efficacy plummeted, I felt extremely ashamed of myself, and decided to cut off all social media. Flash-forward a few years, I joined a community college, fell in love with a completely new field of study, learned things that I had been afraid of, and ended up transferring to a good school. All throughout this journey, the people around me - family and close friends - were incredibly supportive, and my parents couldn't help but say, ""The D in Econ turned out to be a blessing of sorts!""

Now that I see it all, I realized this wasn't as big a deal. However, I still like a worthless piece of shit. I stopped opening up to people because I was afraid to talk about my past; in fact, I felt so ashamed that I began to distance myself from anything and everything that could trigger my memories, started becoming very evasive about my past and (to my absolute horror) slipped in a few lies simply because I couldn't bear to explain the whole situation and relive that moment. During my first quarter at my new university, I looked up a few standard online resources for help with an assignment, and received a minor policy violation for it. This stressed me out so much that my anxiety levels sky-rocketed. I began to second-guess myself for every little thing and started having issues with my roommates; I was curt, unforthcoming, and insensitive, and my entire mindset was ""I just want to get over with this!"" Now, I have one more year to go to complete my undergrad (six years since I graduated high school), and I have this (physically) debilitating fear that something is going to go wrong again. In the past three months of summer break, I have been ruminating excessively about everything I've said or done in the past as well as what could go wrong in the future. I've had a very few nights of decent sleep even though I'm free most days; I wake up in panic and completely short of breath, always find something new to worry about, have stopped washing my face or combing my hair, and honestly, I don't remember what it feels like to not have my stomach knotted up in dread.

All this reached a point where I couldn't bear it anymore and so I decided to do something. The first thing I did was to be honest with my roommates and apologize to them for having been so insensitive and unforthcoming. Both of them seemed very understanding, and I am beyond grateful for that. On the personal development front, I started investing my time into personal projects, interviewed for a research position, and received an offer. However, in spite of all this, I still feel guilty and ashamed, and continue to experience mini panic attacks and existential dilemmas at least twice a day. Last night, I was talking to my parents about the internship procedure in a very dejected voice and my mother just to cut to the chase and asked me, ""You don't seem very happy about this?"" In response, I blurted out, ""I don't want to jinx it!"". She then told me this: ""You need to stop beating yourself up for what happened five years ago. You have moved beyond that point but your mind is still stuck in June 2014.""

Weirdly that really hit the nail on my head, after all these years! (It is just so simple but maybe I had to hit rock-bottom to understand it). That one 'D' in Econ has ended up destroying my life but for altogether different reasons. So today I apologized to myself for being so unforgiving and inconsiderate - towards myself. This isn't a happy-ending and doesn't solve my problems but I think it might be a start. I'm also going to see a therapist to better understand how to cope with my intrusive thinking. I know this experience is very trivial in the larger scheme of things and the ""problem"" seems incredibly exaggerated but there is something to be said about being forgiving and compassionate towards yourself because the way you treat yourself will eventually translate into the way you treat others. (Mom's words) From what I've seen, the people who post and comment on this subreddit think very deeply about others and so that's even more of an incentive to be kinder to yourself :)",12Sep2019,6

Some is individuals I consider close friends have been ignoring me (saying that need space...this was two months ago) or have been saying that I’m not fun.

35,"Hi. I'm a 24F diagnosed with clinical depression and generalized anxiety. I went to a psychiatrist and he prescribed some meds that did help like Lexapro, but in time my depression got worse and he changed it. He prescribed me some tricyclic antidepressants, like Elavil, but it made me so dizzy and my heart was beating so fast all the time. So he changed my medication again. For the last 2 months I've been taking Wellbutrin and Topamax, but I haven't felt a single improvement. I'm not going back to that psychiatrist because I just don't feel like I trust him that much.

I'm being abused. I'm crying intensely at the moment due to something that irks me. 

My abuser, my brother, he called my mom's abuser ""crazy"". He said how could someone do that.

I'm shaking. 
Does he not understand of what he is doing?
He calls it sibling rivarly! 
Who does he believe that will fool!
Himself? Is he truly so deluded?

He has kicked me continuously after throwing me down on the ground for a mistake, he's whipped me for being annoying, he's choked me, he's punched me, he's given me bruises. He calls it sibling rivarly! How fucking idiotic is that?

Sibling rivarly may be a sister hitting another due to them fighting over who gets a certain snack. 

It's not YOU, coming into my room, hitting me because I'm not good enough! I'm not how you want me to be? 

You laugh! You rarely apologize!

He is truly despicable. I'd run away if it wasn't for my cat. 

I've been heavily considering this thought. A lingering temptation. It doesn't go away. I want to end him! Take his life! Cut his throat! Make him  beg for me to stop but i deny his request! Why should I? He never with me!

When! How?

39,"WARNING: Could be triggering to those who are survivors of sexual assault/abuse.  Also, this is going to be a long post.

So for those of you who follow the news, recently the Emily Doe of the Brock Turner case revealed her identity as Chanel Miller. Turns out she's an Asian American woman, I'm an Asian American woman and it was empowering to see her coming forward. It really inspired me to share my story, for the first time, face-to-face with someone. I felt that my therapist was the safest person to tell it to and it was the most positive experience I couldve received. 

The first I ever spoke to about this was when I was 19. This was a romantic partner of mine, who was very unsupportive of my story. He told me ""Arent you glad you didn't tell anyone? Think about how broken apart your family would be if you did. That's your mom's brother."" Not once had that idea ever come across my mind. He instilled in me, fear, and after that, I knew that I could never ever tell anyone in my personal life about my sexual abuse story. 

I was only 6-7 years old and it was my mom's then teenage brother, who assaulted me. For this story, we'll call him Dee. 

The first time (at least I think it was the first time) it happened was one day when I was visiting my grandparents home. Dee asked me if I wanted to play frisbee. I remember we went out into the backyard which was fairly big. Towards the outskirt of the backyard was a shack and two abandoned cars that were parked parallel to each other. And I remember he had me lay down in between those two cars and proceeded to assault me. He told me things like ""Moan for me."" I don't remember how it felt, I don't really remember anything after he told me to do that. 

Flash-forward to another event that took place: I was visiting my grandparents again and Dee took me into the bathroom with him. He sat on the toilet seat and proceeded to have me perform oral sex on him. I remember while we were in the bathroom together, another uncle of mine knocked on the door telling Dee to hurry up with the bathroom because he needed to use it. At that moment, Dee looked at me and gestured me to not make any noises as he responded to my uncle outside the door. Shortly after this, I remember tasting something in my mouth, which I now perceive to be semen, and wanting to spit it out into the trash but he told me to swallow it. After that, he told me to leave the bathroom first so that no one suspected we were in there together.

I'm not really sure if anymore events happened after those two. Honestly, I feel like I didn't comprehend that these events were of sexual abuse until I was in my early teens. At the time the events happened to me, I don't ever remember feeling that I needed to tell someone. I feel like I had little comprehension of what was happening to me. I do remember wetting my bed until I was at least 9 or 10 years old, and looking back it makes me wonder why no one ever looked further into that. Bed-wetting is a sign of childhood sexual abuse.Why didn't anyone think that maybe something was happening to me to make me wet the bed so often, and at an older age than what was normal.

My therapist told me that the reason why I cant remember much of what happened to me or remember how I felt during those moments is because in traumatic times like that, your mind kind of checks itself out in order to survive. 

Something my therapist told me that, quite frankly, made me want to give her a huge hug was that the best way I could help the little girl who endured that pain, is for my current self to process my emotions and to heal. I've never felt so safe about sharing my story nor hopeful that I could proceed to heal from the terrible events that happened to me.

I hope that anyone who is also a survivor knows that 1) you are not alone 2) there are safe places to share your story 3) it is not your fault.",12Sep2019,6

46,"I've been in and out of counseling since age 10 and I really started to feel better about myself at 17. Throughout those 7 years it was my family situation, antipsychotics, and school that kept me down. Now at the age of 20 I recently had a small mental breakdown. It ended with me smoking weed and ending up in the hospital three times in one day. 

I then went into mental health services convinced I needed it and that talking it through would help. Immediately I described my anxiety, abnormal thoughts, and simple auditory hallucinations (Which assumed were hallucinations but not sure. They occurred once a month for multiple months in a year period). I was told I had anxiety disorder which I totally agree with but I was also told I had ""unspecified schizophrenia disorder."" My counselor was an older gentleman who seemed mentally delayed himself so I found it odd he was practitioning. My first two visits (After 3 Intakes!) were him telling my mistakes of getting off of antipsychotics and pushing me immediately to go to a psychiatrist. 

I dropped out of this counseling even though I genuinely wanted to talk through and opted to my doctor prescribing me an anxiety medication called Venlafaxine. Since on the anxiety medication it has helped many of my symptoms go down, I really don't have any of them much anymore. The downside is this month I have been experience restlessness, foggy brain, and other things from the medication. I also general object medication, what they like to call ""non-compliant"" (I hate this terminology so much). 

I want to talk to my primary doctor about getting off of it and just doing this all on my own but he keeps pushing the idea I'm schizophrenic as well. I just feel like I'm genuinely not and wouldn't like to be pushed into antipsychotics or incorrect therapy. My dad is on 6-7 Antipsychotics all at once as he was also diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. I feel like if I do have it, it is a minor case and it definitely doesn't affect my functionality.

The only thing is that for the past few years he's insisted I was just lost. I never was fully okay and finally know I need to be doing more than seeing my therapist once a month. She agrees I should see a psychiatrist. And now I know I need to. I'm under his insurance and I don't want to hide this anymore anyways. I just don't know how to tell him when he's so optimistic about it and I know if I tell him he will get scared again. But I need to tell him.",12Sep2019,1
53,"I go through patterns of irrational and irresponsible behavior, and Ive never really talked to anyone about it. Im tired of it, and I want to feel normal, so I have set up a talk with a doctor.  The following short story is just an example of what I feel and what I do when I go through one of these ""episodes"". Luckily they only last a few days and they dont occur extremely often..maybe once-twice a month. If anyone has any input about what Im experiencing, please share, and thanks so much. 

  

Monday-September 10. First of all, Lee (husband) is not here, and I rely on him a lot, whether I realize it or not. He keeps me in check just by being himself and being here. On Monday, I knew I had lots of things I had to tackle- lab notebooks, studying for the early test, chem homework, getting ready for drill, studying for zoo quiz.… I think that’s it mostly. And the gym of course. That did not happen on Monday. I was thinking of what I would eat, went to class at 930, and I was angry the whole class period because someone took my front row seat, and I struggled to pay attention in class the whole 50 minutes. After class, I had an extreme impulse to go to starbucks, like literally sitting in traffic I made the decision to go there instead of going home (impulsive). I went inside and I ordered much more than I originally wanted, 2 sweets and a drink. I got back into the car and ate that shit so fast I wasn’t even out of the parking lot, then finished the second sweet off by the time I was home. I was physically sick to my stomach, too much sugar, but I kept drinking the Frappuccino anyways. Then, as the tummy ache hit me, I had the urge to throw it all up. Like not actually retching, but thinking that making myself vomit would make the guilt and the sickness go away. So that’s exactly what I did- I went and threw up everything I had just eaten, and not gonna lie, that shit felt great. Made me feel better physically and felt good coming out. I think this is the most that I threw up ever, in amounts of times I induced retching. It was upwards of 10-ish. I vommed so hard that I must have strained my neck because it hurt later that night at work. So, now its time to go to my next class, so I microwave some vegetables, barely have time to force a couple down my throat, and I run out the door. At this point, when I consider my throwing up, I don’t really have any feeling towards it. I don’t feel bad about it, I don’t feel like I have a problem, I don’t think its something that warrants medical attention on its own. I almost feel like an imposter for seeking medical attention for something so stupid. What bothers me so bad about this, is how chaotic it makes me feel, and how fucked up my relationship with food is. I don’t understand it. Its like an addiction that I have to suppress 24/7. I fight off the urge to stop and buy candy (sometimes lose) every time I get in the car. I know that if I bring any money to work, Ill ditch whatever health food I brought in 100% of the time and instead go buy so much fast food that I feel sick and fatigued when I go back to work after lunch. And then grab I candy bar to finish it off. Its an urge I just CANNOT control. 

Now, we cut to yesterday, Tuesday. Im avoiding shit I need to do (avoidant/procrastinating). I go to class, take my zoo quiz, go to chem lab. Chem lab gets out early, and Im starting to plot and plan about how Im going to bake something today. But what? A cake? Cookies? Croissants? I settle on attempting macarons and cake pops. Its important to note that I love to bake, and often do it as stress relief. I usually don’t eat my bakes, but instead give them to other people. But on this particular day, Im wasting precious study time thinking of how Im going to bake these extravagant macarons. I go spend $50 dollars, and by this time its 5pm… Im already late for homework and study time, but Im well aware and I just keep procrastinating anyways. Fast forward to 10 pm, and Ive finally finished baking. They look okay, not crazy great. So I immediately and impulsively eat them, and halfway through I get sick. So I take a small break and then finish the rest. I did not purge these. By the time I started the work I actually had to get done, it was around 11pm. I sit myself in front of the computer and try to work on organic chemistry homework, but honestly, it looks like another language. I cant follow, I cant comprehend…its useless. So I promise myself I’ll wake up a little early before my first class and do this homework. Of course I don’t… I sleep until 8, realize I have forgotten all about a different classes homework that is due today. So, I skip my first class this morning so I can do my second class’s homework..very rushed and stressfully. So at this point in the week, Im feeling extremely frazzled. Cant think straight, feel like im in a fog, having trouble focusing in my classes. So, I decide Im going to call out of work and go speak to a doctor about mental health, because Im tired of this pattern.",12Sep2019,1

Prefacing this to say I’m (F,20) not depressed but I’m starting to wonder if I chose the wrong Major or if school just isn’t for me . 

I (F,20) used to be really creative I would draw,paint, do weird makeup, write lyrics , write poetry etc but then I got in a dark place and I can’t seem to get out of that dark place when it comes to being creative or doing school work . In regards to school I do try very hard , I spend countless hours studying and revising my work  to no avail .  

I want to find something I’m good at that I can build a career on. I know the one talent people say I have is making others feel better but I don’t know where to go from there I took a psychology course and hated it , I’m okay at sociology but idk . 

I know if I had the skill I would love to be a lyricist , a writer or performing artist but isn’t that a dream everybody has ? 

I just feel like I don’t have a purpose . 

TL;DR: I feel like I don’t have a purpose , I’m not good at anything anymore, I feel like college might not be for me , but I don’t know what to do .",12Sep2019,32

56,"Hi

I feel like I have glass splinters inside my forehead, above and right between my eyes. In a circular area, about the size of tiny makeup boxes that women carry around which have tiny mirror on the inside.

Can someone help me how to get rid of this phantom feeling. This is causing much distraction and mild headaches. I am even scared to touch the area.

**Short story long**: 

A few nights back I had dream. 

We were trying to get through a mystic portal of some kind into some place. This portal was made of glass/mirror, inside a tiny circular metal box, about the size of Nivea cream boxes. The first person got through it(that too might have been me as well).

How we warp is, we slowly get absorbed/sucked into the portal and then we are in the other place/room. And then, when I tried, the absorption part started, but eventually it felt as if the process was reversing. Instead of me being absorbed into the portal, the glass part of the portal slowly crumbled and got absorbed into my forehead. 

My partner (have never seen this man/guy before. But we bonded like brother in law. My wife doesn't have brothers. My sister is yet to get married,not in a relationship.) planned to take me to the hospital. We have to get on the motorcycle and he has to drive me. I didn't know him before, I didn't like or dislike him (except for my dislike of social interactions). Before we could leave, we were interrupted by multiple family matters. And we finally got on the motorcycle and he started driving. 

We eventually reached a cross road(He now felt like the younger brother of a brother in law). Where the smaller road we were on was merging with the highway. And he did say something witty, for a kid his age. And I said something like, ""you think you are a doctor"" or ""you are a doctor"".",12Sep2019,1
57,"Hey, everyone. I’m not sure if this is the right sub reddit to post this to, so if it’s not, please redirect me.

I’ve struggled with mental illness my entire life, but haven’t been able to pinpoint what exactly I have. I’m posting here in search of opinions or ideas of what it may be.

When I was 17 years old, I started experiencing a loss of appetite, loss of interest in hobbies and life, and perpetual sadness. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder as a result.

When I was 19, I began experiencing sudden panic attacks that came unprompted, irritable bowls, shaking, and sudden vomiting. I was then diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder (though in my opinion, I think I have Panic Disorder.)

However, I still have so many random symptoms that don’t seem to fit in the depression or anxiety category.

As a child (roughly ages 8-14), I had delusions of grandeur. I believed that a meteor was going to hit the Earth and would literally stand outside each night and stare at the sky waiting. I also believed that the devil could hear my thoughts. At one point I believed that my dog could secretly speak and was hiding it from my family. (Yeah, I know... weird.)

These delusions aren’t as frequent nowadays, but they are still present. I have a delusion that I can’t shake that my dad has hidden a camera in my bedroom (I have no basis for this belief.) I also constantly think my spouse is cheating on me.

I just need help :( Any thoughts?",12Sep2019,3
58,"Gonna try to make this as concise as possible. Basically I’m 22, (f) graduated college in May. Did summer internship and am now looking for full time job. I have been deeply depressed before and that didn’t feel like how I feel now.
Basically, I’ve been sleeping up to 15 hours a day every day for the past month and a half. Some days more than others but at least 9 hours a day. Been feeling super anxious and a bit depressed-ish but not fully blown like before. Not like a deep painful sadness, more like anxious and lonely and hopeless and worthless. 
I went to doc and got bloodwork done and doctor couldn’t find anything wrong. Also been feeling really spacey, disconnected to world and kinda high but I’m not high just like out of it and fuzzy in my brain.
I work out like 3 or 4 times a week usually (a bit less last two weeks as I’ve just been so unmotivated) and it helps my mood but makes me exhausted mentally. I eat pretty well. I don’t know what’s going on.
Had anyone had this experience or maybe know what’s wrong? Am I simply depressed? Could this be medical? I’m so confused!",12Sep2019,1

61,"I recently finished my freshman year of college and it was probably the most interesting experiences of my life (for a lack of better terms). Going into college, I already had really bad mental health but I felt as though college would be a time for me to turn that around and be happy but Freshman year was pretty lackluster and hurt me pretty bad. And I feel as though that was due to my mental health related stuff (like anxiety) as well as the people at my school. There was a certain group of people at my school that I didn't know whatsoever and still don't really know at all but, we all lived in a close proximity of each other at the dorms. We were strangers initially (I would pass by them and they wouldn't look at me or say anything) but I started to notice that they acted weird around me. They would give me pretty ""rude"" / ""disgusted"" stares (I don't know how else to describe it) and I saw them whispering among themselves and because of that, I felt as though the whole vibe was off. This gave me massive anxiety and made me feel extremely uncomfortable even entering my building because of them. And as time went on, they continued to do the same stuff and I felt as though maybe I was just overthinking it but that was until I started to notice that their friends that didn't live on the same floor, started doing what they were doing. Whenever I would walk around campus, they would stare at me uncomfortably.  This went on for months and really took a toll on my stability. At that point, I asked one of my friends that lived in the same room to see what they would say and she refused to tell me, just saying they were horrible people. The only thing she told me was that they said one time ""it's okay to make fun of \_\_\_\_, because us &lt;insert ethnicity&gt; are critical of eachother all the time."" At that point, I didn't know what to do. To make matters worse, even before that whole situation, I already felt ostracized from my own ethnicity on my campus. The whole situation really just made me feel like an outsider and made me feel like I don't belong anywhere. I feel as though I'm ostracized from my gender for not being masculine enough and furthermore, I feel ostracized from my own ethnicity. It just makes me wonder what was so terrible about me that they disliked me that much. Maybe it's because of the way I dress. My style is pretty mainstream but niche if that makes sense (honestly probably doesn't). But it's not something I see a lot of guys wear at my school. I get a handful of compliments about it but sometimes I wonder if they're just being sarcastic or something. Another possible reason i could think of is because I opened a door for them a couple times and maybe they got the wrong message?? And the last thing I could think of is because of how I look. I'm pretty ugly and so idk and I definitely get treated differently because of that. The thought of me being ugly always lingered in my head but the thought wasn't fully concrete till someone called me ugly. They didn't say it directly to me though, they said it to this girl that I guess you could say I was dating. She basically told her ""why are you dating him, he's ugly."" That hurt and it still hurts to this day because I know I'm not attractive but I feel as though I shouldn't be treated differently because of that. Like for example, a receptionist at my school was super nice to this guy in front of me but when she got to me, she was pretty rude for no reason whatsoever. I've had similar experiences like that growing up and even more recently at an airport. It just sucks and makes me feel horrible. And I feel as though that group of people might've been saying stuff about my appearance. And this group isn't a couple of people, it's about 11ish people. So yep, that sucks.

63,"This is the short version of a much longer story.

My now ex-girlfriend started having mental health issues. She was seeing people that weren’t there and talking to them. She has attempted suicide 4 times in the last 2 months. She keeps pushing me away, but I’m the only person she can rely on. She has a son who I have raised as my own for 4 years.

She started showing signs of PTSD related problems about 9 months ago. She had an extremely abusive childhood and a very abusive adulthood. Her son is a is a product of the abuse.

We lived together nearly 4 years. I gave her everything, a home, a family and I loved her.

9 months ago she became completely delusional and saw people that weren’t there. She had names for them. She also claimed that she had multiple personalities, all of which had names. She always followed tones of conspiracy theories about something called “gang stalking”. She believed that the government was performing behavioural experiments on her.

At one point she nearly met up with some random guy on a gang stalking forum. I didn’t let her go as she didn’t know this guy’s name beyond a username. After learning I didn’t let her go this guy claimed I was obviously in on the conspiracy against her. She actually asked me at one point if I’d ever been paid to give information on her to the government.

I got her to see a doctor. I basically had to force her because she believed that doctors were in on the conspiracy.

During this time she begged me not to leave her, I promised her I never would because I loved her.
She asked to have a baby with me but I said no, because I was worried about her mental state.

One day she announced she didn’t love me anymore and kicked me out of the house. I wasn’t allowed to see my son who I’d raised for 4 years and I lost everything.

My home, My son, The woman I loved.

Gone.

She eventually realised she needed me in to look after the boy while she was at work as she couldn’t afford child care. I jumped at the chance because I love my son.

She has attempted suicide 4 times in the last 2 months. If I didn’t intervene the last time by rushing over to her and kicking her door in. My son would have woken up to an empty home with his mothers corpse in the bath tub. During this attempt she was texting me the whole time saying how I let her down and that nobody cared about her. She wouldn’t answer the phone so I raced over and broke in. she was overdosing in the bath tub. I got her to the emergency ward and luckily they were able to save her using charcoal to absorb the drugs.

She is seeing a therapist regularly now and has been diagnosed with Psychosis cause by PTSD. She is also in a new relationship with a man called Tom. Fun fact about Tom, he doesn’t exist outside her delusional hallucinations. This man simply DOES NOT EXIST. She claims to have started a relationship with him while we were together. At first before I realised this guy didn’t exist I thought she had been cheating on me.

She didn’t cheat on me. Simply because this “Tom” is just a fantasy.

She has referred to Tom as “a manipulative monster”, “The Homewreaker” and “the man who loves me”.

I asked how she first met Tom and her response was “he raped me in the back of his landrover”. No shit!

I asked how she could leave me for somebody that could possibly do this to her and she said “because he loves me”.

I have explained to her that I don’t believe this man exists but she just laughs and says “my therapist doesn’t believe me either”

I told her I wanted to support her trough all this no matter how long it took because I loved her and I wanted our family back. But she just says on repeat “I don’t love you and we are never getting back together”.

If anything happens to her I have no legal attachment to my son. His biological father is a abusive POS but for some reason he has more say over the boy than I do. He's never given him a cent, but I raised him for nearly 4 years. 

I love my son.

I started talking to my own therapist and I was picked up by the cops 3 weeks ago while attempting to throw myself of a bridge.

Last Friday I had asked my ex to go have an evening a meal with me. I did this just to get her mind off of everything and give her a fun night. We had a great time and she had fun. I took her home and asked if the next time we went out maybe we could call it a “date”. She totally rejected this idea and kinda freaked out. She said I had ruined her whole night and she already had a boyfriend (Tom) she said I’d betrayed her trust and she kicked me out of the house again. I’d been living on her sofa since her last suicide attempt 3 weeks earlier. I asked her why she didn’t love me and she cried and said she didn’t know.

I was explaining everything to a therapist last night on the phone while walking around an empty parking lot and I broke down hysterically laughing. I can’t explain why as I’m in a great deal of emotional pain and I’m very confused right now. I was crying with laughter my face was covered in tears but I was laughing and I couldn’t stop.

My therapist called the police and had me escorted to a safe place.

Now I’m here.


Just thought I’d post my story anonymously to get some thoughts on this as I am very confused. My life ended for insane reasons.

What should I Do?

I've spoken to therapists and friends and they all advise me to think about myself. But it's not in my nature to do so. besides, the only thing I want is my family back.

64,"Hi, it’s 3 AM and I can’t sleep because I think my mom hate me (even though I know rationally she doesn’t.) 
Basically, I was sleeping on the couch and all the sudden my mom starts putting on all the lights and her &amp; my brother are having a loud conversation. I get pretty frustrated at this, so I ask what they could possibly need at 3 AM. My mom tells me, clearly mad at me, ‘do you think I want to be up right now?’ and says she was looking for something to give my brother who was having a toothache.
I didn’t apologize in the moment because I was just so tired and frustrated, but now I can’t stop thinking of the tone of voice my mom used. My mind’s telling me that she hates me, that I should never talk to anyone again in my entire life because it’s just better for everyone if I just the hell up. It also triggered my suicidal thoughts, because now I’m thinking, well she yelled at me, so she clearly must want me dead. Everyone’s better off if I’m dead, I’ve proven that now. Obviously these thoughts are scaring me a little.
And the thing is, I know rationally that it’s not true. My mom doesn’t hate me, she doesn’t want me dead, she was just frustrated in the moment.  That’s the weird thing- I feel like I’m going insane because my perception of other people’s emotions is so skewed that my mind wants me to believe I should throw myself off of a building if someone just yells at me. Am I going crazy?
I guess I’m just asking if anyone knows any coping mechanisms or has had similar experiences in not perceiving other people’s emotions the right way. I can’t wake my mom up now, so I can’t resolve the issue tonight. I think I’m just gonna spend the next six hours hating myself and everyone around me. Help?

66,Friendly reminder that you are not a burden to tell your friends about your mental health and issues.,12Sep2019,55
67,"So recently, I've been seeing my sister struggle with her mental health a lot. She's been using some unhealthy outlets as coping mechanisms and I'm trying to help her break out of her negative cycles. I have been offering her positive advice, motivating her to engage in positive self-talk and to believe in herself, and inviting her to join me in healthier activities that have helped me through darker times. At times, she'll be on board with accepting my invitation to hang out and talk things out, but typically it's a short-lived talk and then she'll walk away, going back to her cycle of unhealthy habits and actions. 

A few years ago, when I was her age, I went through some severe depression and engaged in a lot of the same toxic habits as what she is currently engaging in. Since I started practicing yoga, I learned how to be nicer to myself and how to manage my mental health better. I began learning more about how to take care of my self and fill up my own cup. Recently, I moved home for a short period of time so I can spend more time with my family before my career takes me further and further away from home. Upon moving home, I have become an observer of the toxic communication patterns within my family. (I was a coms major in college and I actually used to write analyses on my family's communication patterns as assignments for school when I took family communication) I can see a lot of the underlying issues that have become the norm in our ways of interacting with one another. My family practices minimal empathy for one another and constantly blames one another for various problems, with everyone frequently taking turns playing the victim. This has inadvertently resulted in my parents raising three depressed children under the same roof. 

Leaving home was a huge catalyst for me overcoming my depression. My siblings are both younger than me and I was having a heart-to-heart with my brother, who's a middle schooler, tonight. He revealed to me that he feels sad almost every day and basically lives with mild depression and it influences his frequent bad behavior at school, his constant butting-heads with our parents, and addiction to electronics. He hasn't talked about this with anyone, he doesn't really have friends, and doesn't feel comfortable telling our parents. He says that it's just something that is for him to deal with every day and that's it. I told him that he could always talk to me or even our other sister whenever he is feeling down. Also I told him that even after I move away, that I would check him with him every day and he needs to tell me where he is on the happiness/sadness scale and he agreed to this. Middle school is when my depression started forming and is also when my younger sister had a suicide attempt. I do not want this pattern to repeat with my brother. 

I approached my sister about our brother's mental health situation and asked if she could check in with him for me periodically when I'm gone since our brother doesn't have any sort of support system. They have a history of butting heads and she basically told me she has zero sympathy for him because he's annoying, egotistical, and only cries for attention. I tried explaining to her that his cries for attention are a reflection of his internal suffering and depression and that she could be there for him. Essentially, she started going off about when she was his age, how she felt like I ignored her so much and all of our parents' attention went to our younger brother instead of her, which led to her suicide attempt. This is definitely an unresolved trauma and is triggering for her. I told her about how when I was in middle school and high school, I felt much the same way because our parents always assumed I had my shit together and didn't have to worry about me, so they spent all of their energy tending to my younger siblings. I also tried explaining to my sister this toxic cycle that is repeating with each child within our family and how we could do something to help our youngest sibling since we've gone through this shit already. She basically said that it's up to our brother to deal with it himself because nobody was there for her. She feels like since her wounds are still not healed, that she shouldn't do anything to help her younger brother, even though he's at a high risk of repeating this toxic cycle and pattern of severe depression that we have experience coping with. 

The thing is, our family was very much aware of depression by the time my sister was going through it because I made sure my parents were conscious of the mental health status' of their children before I left for college. Everyone remembers things differently and has their own perspectives. My sister essentially reminded me of how I could have done more to prevent her suicide attempt since I was one of the last three people to see her before she tried it. She went into more detail about how I kept saying the wrong things to her like on that day, like to ""take a deep breath"" or to ""forget about the problem for a few minutes so she could calm down"" from the problem that triggered her on the day of her suicide attempt. I told her about how for a long time, I carried around the guilt that I felt like it was my fault that she had her suicide attempt and there was nothing I could do now to change what had already happened. I also reminded my sister of all the actions our parents and I did to try to help her through her tough times and how often I came home from college every weekend, to spend more time with her. In her memory though, we didn't do anything to help her and nothing we said were the right words, it was always the perfectly wrong thing. Part of me gets it, like yeah how can someone tell me to calm down and forget about my worries, that's fucking impossible, but also, it's fucking possible, and when you're depressed, you're often in a trapped mindset and way of thinking. 

I relate depression to the prisoners in the allegory of the cave because once I overcame depression, whenever I try to share my methods of healing to my sister, who is still suffering from depression, she discounts all of what I have to say as nonsense or unrealistic. She says that my ""advice"" is insensitive and that I can't just tell her to ""try to see things from a new perspective."" I'm not trying to put the responsibility of making sure our brother's mental health is fine on my sister. All I wanted was for her to periodically converse with him, that's it. They currently only yell at each other or ignore each other by locking themselves in their own rooms most of the time. All I asked my sister for was that if our brother ever needs someone to talk to, and I can't be there for him for whatever reason and it's urgent, that she be there to listen to him. She was completely unreceptive and maybe it was too much to ask of her. I'm honestly not sure if it was insensitive for me to ask this of her or not. Just not exactly sure what to do here because I see a toxic pattern and I don't have any resolution because every member of my family is so stuck in their usual ways and makes excuses whenever I try to encourage them to do something new. A phrase I commonly hear coming out of my parents and siblings' mouths is ""I already tried other things and none of them worked"", essentially saying I tried and I don't think anything will ever work because I haven't seen any real changes.",12Sep2019,1
68,"Hi, i need a day off from school because it’s been impacting my mental health. Friday is the day in particular that’s been impacting my mental health. You have to wake up early, bring heavy items, you’ll be yelled at, and collective punishments are very common. I honestly don’t have any problem at the other days. being at school at fridays has always given me stress, anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, and it has exhausted my body incredibly and given me pains around my hands due to all the stress in my head and the physical punishments i always get.

I absolutely dont have my shit together and am very far from who I was when I felt better but I also dont think my condition is as bad as what I read of other people who talk about mental health.

The thing is, that when I feel bad I dont have the energy to make an appointment and when I have the energy I feel too OK to waste their time.

How do I figure out if a psychological assessment would be the right thing? I want to feel better but I dont want to steal a spot.

A little creak or noise puts me on alert and my brain has to assign it as something. A creaky floor bored or air pressure difference causing a door to move. Otherwise my brain instantly shoots to ""intruder"" and I get defensive. A great example is my basement. Its a finished basement. I constantly have my eye on the stair case because it doesn't have a door. I am only truly comfortable when i'm in a room with 1 entry with a door on it. I can hear the door and instantly know something is moving. For instance my bedroom/office. It has 1 door and a window next to the front entrance to the house. I love it for that reason.

82,"Those goodbye letters that you have written, stored at the back of your drawers, hidden from the light of the day because you're afraid your parents might be heart broken to know that their ray of sunshine is going through something, is your strength. 
Having gone through it all at a young age, I learnt how depression attacks you anywhere, not discriminating the time or place. I have soaked cushion covers, crying myself to sleep. I have suffocated myself, depriving myself of the smallest moments of happiness in my life. Depression took the best years of my life away. I laid in my bed, thinking of ways to die. I thought of all the people I had ever hurt. I reminisced the ways I used to smiled, when I meant it. I imagined how happy everyone would be without my existence. I stored all my notes, of the numerous words I had been called, the scars I had, the battles I fought with myself. The poems that called depression pretty angered me. I felt the wrath in my veins when those poets made it seem plausible that crying myself to sleep was cute. It did not feel that way. I wanted to die. I wanted to die. I wanted to die. 
The day I decided to die, 29th of November, 2016, I sat down, crying. This was all that it led to. I did not have to.gwt bullied anymore. I took one last look at my hand. I rolled up the sleeves of my jacket. My hand was filled with scars. Line by line, every touch of the scalpel hurt me. I thought of all the happy moments in my life. All the times I laughed with my friends, all the times my parents smiled at me, all the times I listened to new music, all the times I saw people happy, all the time I was happy. For a second, I thought I was more than my battles, or my scars. I was more than the words that others called me. I was more than those who hit me. I was more than those who pulled me down. So are you. 
You're a person of your own. You define yourself. If you're going through anything remotely similar, you probably cry yourself to sleep, thinking of how your end would be the start of a happier life for others. It's not true. You're not living your life for them. All those times that you've been happy, those countless memories that you consist of, they make you a person. A human. A human others would be glad to meet. Do not die. Life is hard, but you're strong. You have lived through the worst battles, till now. Go on. It gets better. It gets better. 
It really does get better.",12Sep2019,4

85,"Hi everyone,

Name is Jose. I mainly post on the Sim Racing subreddits but I made my way over here because I wanted to share my story, and also discuss both the outlets I have found that have really strengthened my mental health to the point that I feel some of that innocence of my youth starting to come back and it's beautiful.

Depression, anxiety and OCD ran my life for nearly 20 years. It was my own stories that I made up in my head that led me to that lifestyle and what I have learned is that at one point in my life I made a conscious decision to feel that way based on my lack of knowledge and understanding to what was really happening. I felt these negative effects as if a blanket had been pulled over me and I just felt heavy, slow and sluggish all the time. I started talking myself down and felt worthless. 

I can't even begin to describe how lucky I am to have been surrounded by the people that have been around me for so long and they are the ones that helped almost without them even knowing it. The help came from within me and I simply started to look at things differently and make sense of them differently. I started making conscious decisions to live the life I wanted. 

Now, coming up on two years, my first company will be turning 2, and I have since started working on a new project where I have found the biggest tool to strengthen my mental health.

I started go karting back in Puerto Rico when I was 5 years old. Unable to afford it on my own, I was never able to do it professionally. Simulator Racing has really taken off and taking the plunge to work for myself has allowed me the opportunity to get into Simulator Racing quite seriously. It has made me feel like the 5 year old karting kid I used to be without a worry in the world. Except this time, I'm the same 5 year old with 25 years of knowledge on top of that and the world makes a bit more sense now. It's a beautiful thing. 

Being aware and accepting how this has made me feel, I've really taken on a passion for continuing to strengthen my mental health and also sharing my experiences. I want to share my experiences because for so long I searched for answers, never really finding anything that worked FOR ME. My experiences are from me, dealing with it on a day to day basis, and really trying to learn something from it. I really hope that my experiences are able to help someone because it's such a beautiful thing being able to free my mind, even if it's just for 5 minutes a day, sometimes those 5 minutes can be a life changing moment. 

I am doing all of this through my social media platforms. On Instagram I discuss my food photography business along with the effects that working for myself and working in that industry has affected my mental health, and on YouTube discussing Sim Racing and how the simulator itself serves as another tool to strengthen mental health. 

Should you ever want to seek out someone else's experiences dealing with mental health, my social media platforms are linked below.

To start things off my mom has anxiety and depression and is on pregabalin for it (idk how this would help but im clueless on this so I included it anyway incase it holds significance). My mom got anxiety and depression through extensive drug abuse and from traumatic periods In her life, now flash back to about 2-3 years ago when I first started doing drugs, I was a bright kid, was never bad at school and had decent grades, like a year later things started to go a little downhill as I started taking drugs more and more, eventually I started smoking weed everyday without fail and I even steal sometimes just to get a gram because without smoke my brain just overloads and I start to lose my shit at the tiniest things, anyway fast forward to my final year of school, this year was just crazy, I was constantly in trouble at school whether it be for stealing, fighting, being a Kyle and punching walls, headbutting door frames, flipping chairs etc. Just being a complete dickhead in general, but then my head of year pointed something out, there is nothing that puts me in a bad mood, it will just happen out of nowhere, one minute I'd be all happy and hyper in my lessons, and then within the space of a minute id be losing my shit, I did a little research on bipolar and the symptoms just seem toooooo accurate, anyway, you can probably guess how my grades did this year...

87,"I've been thinking of dropping out of school for years now ever since I was in 6th Grade. At the time I didn't mind it much, but wanted to be homeschooled instead because at least I was still studying, just not in school but at home.

Every year (ever since 6th grade) there was always a thought of dropping out of school. Especially when I was in 7th-8th grade, I always found excuses not to go to school. My mom still doesn't know that majority of those excuses were lies, because I knew if I told my mom I wanted to drop out she would get mad at me and give me lectures and all that. 

My thoughts of dropping out kind of stopped when I was in 9th grade because I was finally moved into homeschooling. This homeschooling was different though, you had a choice to go to those classes they have once a week, and my mom didn't ask me if I wanted to go to those classes, she just made me go to them. I got mad at her for a while but I realized I was actually fine with it because it was actually kind of fun and even better than my previous school. 

Moving on to 10th grade I was getting the sense of wanting to drop out again. I didn't mind it though, because I felt like it was just because of schoolworks and how stressed I was. But throughout this timeline (6th-10th grade) I only realized now that my mental health was getting worse and worse every year. I didn't know and still don't know how to deal with it.

I'm currently in 11th grade and I really want to drop out. I've been trying my best to not think about it, telling myself that it's most likely because of schoolworks and all that. But honestly, my mental health is getting worse every single day. I honestly hope I was exaggerating about that but I'm not. I don't really know what to do. I want to tell my mom that I want to drop out after the 1st Sem ends. But I'm too afraid to tell her because I hate explaining why, and I'm pretty sure she won't allow me to.",12Sep2019,2

97,"Hey,  

This is an attempt from me, because I am feeling really bad rn (and I dont know if im in the right subreddit), to try and get some help.

&amp;#x200B;

Ive never had friends nor hang out with anyone for the last couple of years (im 22 now) but i did have my gf.  

I had PMO problems and it ruined my relationship with her. I would think of other girls, think of cheating, bored with sex cuz PMO ruined my head etc.  

Since it was like that, we would break up occasionaly for like few weeks, and I would start feeling dreadfull without her.  

Eventualy we would get back together.  

This happened a few times over last couple of years and it would always be the same in my fucking head:  

**When shes mine** i dont love her the way a bf should, especialy with that PMO situation, i would be like yeh shes here, as if she was just some kind of arbitrary extra for me, not my soulmate.  

**When we break up and shes not mine**, I cant sleep, I check mesages every 30min to see if she responded to some random msg i sent her,I cant eat, im crying-  

&amp;#x200B;

We broke up 2 months ago when I went to my vacation house due to same problems, but in those 2 months i tried and did fix my PMO because I truly wanted to be with her and have a healthy relationship (which ofc then includes sex life too)

She offered me to be together again a few weeks back when i got back from my vacation house but I didnt want to cuz I fixed my PMO problems and I wanted to fuck other girls while having her as an option. However I didnt do anything, I tried but I would always end up thinking about her no matter what I do. Like ""Wow, maybe casual sex isnt better than having a real loving gf"" (i never still had a casual sex with anyone other nor had any other gf ever, so my curiosity kills me)

This is now, our last cycle (currently in breakup faze) and last few days i couldnt function and she was in town where i live and we said we would maybe see eachother but she said maybe not because she was ready to move on from me. Iz was literally killing me. I was in my bathroom 3am shakin freezing cold, afraid i might lose her.  

I would wake up in the middle of the night, check my phone at like 5am then go back to sleep anxious.  

&amp;#x200B;

**NOW FOR WHAT THE FUCK I CANT STAND ANYMORE:**  

Like I said, ***when Im losing her***, or i know shes not mine and shes slowly deleting memories of me in her head, im losing my mind. Im thinking like ""ok other girls,casual sex"" but i end up just crying, thinking how i shoulda told her i love her, how i shoulda been honest, and how im ready to accept that im fucked up but she still wants me and i want to become a good bf to her.  

And ***when i know im not losing her***, like just today when she just told me she will come to talk to me, and when i asked does she wanna stay few days, she said maybe if our talk goes right. This in my head means that we are going back together AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IN 1 SECOND I lose all those fears of losing her, all those EVERYTHING, i can eat I can whatever. But in a bad way, im no loger having that inner fire thinking ""i just want to hug her, fuck everything else"" or ""im gonna run up to her when she leaves the train when she gets here and just cry in her hug"" and im just like, chilling.  

Like almost ""eh, whatever"" stance. Like I dont care, were together again, cool. LIKE WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT.    

Im no longer like wanting her love, her touch **as much**. I literally would do anything for her to not go when shes not mine, and when i get a confirmation she still is, im like cold stone chill almost dont care, dont wanna go to park or moovies as badly as i wanted when she wasnt mine.  

I am so sorry for this awfull text, but i just didnt know what to do and I dont wanna spiral down some bad thoughts...  

**TLDR**: I want to love my gf like she deserves it, and give her back the love she gives to me. When shes gone, Id do anything in world to get her back, but when I do get her back, I just instantly turn cold, like i dont care ""stay or go, whatever"". If it sounds sick, you got it correct.

101,"Title summarizes it. My husband and I met at 27 and 30 with no children from previous relationships. We always wanted children, the more the merrier. 6 years later now and I’m pregnant with #3. Looking back I know I had some mild ppd with #1 but was able to tough it out. Didn’t medicate because I was pregnant shortly after having the 1st. My #2 came 10 weeks early. NICU stay and uncertainty about her health really made the ppd show. My body and mind needed a break. 1.5 later and I felt like I was finally getting somewhat better but just in time to get pregnant again. Well boom, I’m 13 weeks pregnant and at my lowest point ever. I’m anxious and agitated, I beg my toddlers to leave me alone so I can cry and lay down in peace. My husband tries to help but doesn’t know how. He nonstop complains about money. I brought up not having a 4th kid yesterday and we pretty much had a 12 hr off and on screaming match. He says I’m selfish and lied about wanting a bunch of kids. I’m begging him to understand.

After this happened I'm legit terrified of any1. People approach me or want to ask me sth my heart will go nuts in fear sometimes i don't even want to leave my house knowing I'll be in danger and many times thought of going out without taking my phone.

As I was fixing my loose break cable (looking directly down), I accidentally ran into the back of a Jeep.

I didn't even fall of my Bike, but had a scrap above my right eye which was bleeding quite abit.

I went to the Hospital and the Doctor's examined me carefully and said there was nothing out of the ordinary. 

They glued my gash directly above my right eye and I got a Tetanus Shot. 

I feel fine and am wearing a Helmet from now on when I bike. 

It has been over 24 hours since the incident and felt zero signs of a concussion, nor did the doctors notice anything to indicate a concussion.

I am 24, was biking less than half the speed (lightly coasting) the average person can run at.

Than 4-5 months ago I got angry about something small and dumb and realized I don't want to that either let's figure that out. Since than it's been absolute hell. Every past mistake Ive made is destroying me, I feel like everyone is only thinking about them. Every few days I'm thinking about something that's not 100% and how I was doing it wrong, how I need to fix it, how to fix it. It's consuming my entire day. I just want it to stop. I want to be able to truly enjoy my day but the constant thinking and beating myself up and wanting to fix years of mistakes in seconds is driving me crazy. I want to apologize for things people didn't know about that I didn't do to them or they don't find bad so it will go away. The worst is when they don't think it was bad and I do try to apologize it becomes an itch I can't scratch. I'm thinking about these things so much I can't think of anything to say to my wife. Like I need to think of something?!? I feel like I need to fill every second with her or else she'll find me boring or something wrong with me and leave me(there is zero evidence of that) but that's just how I'm spending my days.

108,"To start it all off, I know it's not the best idea to vent out about myself to strangers, and that I should get professional help. I just want some advice or consolation about my mental state.

The only factual information I'll give out is that I'm from the Philippines, and that I'm an academic scholar.

So I've been really stressed and tired for the past few months, and it has only gotten worse. 

I've been talking to friends much less and rarely even hang out with my friends on weekends. Also, I've been much more sensitive to the comments my (let's say girlfriend but she really doesn't like that title when I use it when we talk, so let's just call her Y) gives from time to time. I've been more mad at things and just generally sad all the time, compared to before when I was one of the popular kids in school. I've been in better control of my temper, but generally more negative in nature. I've also cried quite a few times in the past few months, and fought with my father, Y(a lot with her), and sometimes even my best friends.

I feel worthless, sensitive and shitty most of the time. I'm losing motivation gradually and have been feeling generally less happy and insecure about myself. Headaches are pretty common now, too.

I guess the stress of academics is a huge factor for this, since I made a promise to myself to actually take school seriously starting now. Despite that, I've still been failing math (although I admit, there was one heavy test where only 2 people out of 84 in an entire batch passed), and not doing what I would consider my fullest potential.

I think Y triggers it a lot too. She throws out a lot of comments about me, but I understand that we're quite young, and that she means constructive criticism.

Please, if any anon can give me some advice or lighten my day up, do so. It would help me a lot.

Thank you for even considering to read this.",12Sep2019,1
109,"I was badly bullied in school for all years. Daily harassed and a target for violence. I was threatened, beaten, called things and excluded. Got my things either stolen, hidden or damaged. This was more or less my daily life in school for years. About 5 years were totally hell, from age 11, the rest just bad. It was a war. I got pretty hard through this time. First I tried to adjust to the bullies and the majority but this didn’t work, so I distanced myself from them and isolated myself from everyone, making the situation worse. I felt everyone were against me, both inside and outside of school. There’s still graffiti in the place I live with my name harassing me, been there since forever, I think that’s pretty illustrative. 

Some years ago I stopped seeing myself as a victim anymore, but I’m still cautious. An example is that it took me close to 7 years to join a gym. I’m never comfortable going out. It’s like it never ended. 

I’ve always been seen as different, been excluded and left alone. The rest of the damage is because I isolated and distanced myself from others. This is still on. I’ve obviously social anxiety, had problems connecting to others during my time at Uni, which has made me very lonely, few (none) friends, nothing going on, no life. That said, I’m often seen as charismatic, interesting and very passionate, this makes me also get in contact with people, but I’m often fucking it up because of my anxiety and insecurity. 

I’ve due to the bullying and some newer episodes problems with my own looks. I’m not ugly, but I’m not attractive I’ve been told. This has made me pretty much anxious as well, feeling inferior to others and therefor spending a lot of time researching plastic surgery. I much want to hide up and not being much outside at the worst. I’m not visiting venues I don’t feel at home, or other places for that sake. Where people can see me as a stranger, someone who don’t belong in there. Be a bar, club, beach or concert. I’m not feeling welcome, such places are not for me. 

I’m often not feeling au pair with others, feeling inferior, a class B man, or worse maybe. I’m sometimes feeling I’ve less rights than others, like I’m denied things others take for granted. I’ve even been told by someone at least one time I have to understand that, not direct, but very understated. 

In today’s society with social media, ads, ideals everywhere, I’m just feeling anything can blow up these feelings. Just walking outside is a roulette with fuel for my depression as reward. 

I have very little belief in myself. I’m struggling getting work after my graduation, I’m struggling socially, I’m lonely and more and more isolating myself. I’m dragged more and more alive into my depression and anxiety, and I fear it’s spiralling to something worse. Everything gets harder for each day and I’m having less and less motivation. I don’t really have any motivation at all anymore. I’ve de facto given up on my life. I’m totally unable to improve anything. I’m feeling more and more like a looser. 

I’m feeling time is running away from me at age 27, I just wish I could live. Like just another guy.",12Sep2019,1

Also, I tried various depression medications growing up, and NOTHING worked. They just made me tired, and caused me to miss school. Im in my 20s, and enough is enough. I need medication to control my thoughts. I have tried Klonopin and It would really well with my depression. Do I go in saying ""Klonopin works really well for me.""?

124,"I am an adult who has struggled in several ways for most of my life. I have never been diagnosed with anything more than anxiety, but some of my siblings have been diagnosed with ADHD, depression, and a personality disorder. I have an upper-middle-class IQ and, as a child, I was considered academically gifted. 

Symptoms: 

1. Trouble processing auditory information AT ALL- this one has terrible effects on my life. I don't hear words sometimes. If I ask a question of my professor, I don't hear substantial parts of the answer. In job interviews, I try to create facial expressions that suggest I heard what they said. I hear the sounds, but they aren't processing as information. 
2. I process all information slowly. This is not just my perception, although I definitely perceive it to be true. I had neuropsychological testing once, and although I did very well on most of the tests, my processing speed was in the 14th percentile. They told me it was probably anxiety. All I know is that I work much longer hours than others do, only to just keep up with them. 
3. I can be oblivious to social cues. I think this might be a symptom of slow processing, but I can't swear. When someone makes a subtle joke, I will sometimes fail to realize it's a joke and embarrass myself by displaying my obliviousness. 
4. As far back as I can remember, I and the people around me have had the sense that I was not performing up to my abilities. At one time, I thought this was the result of laziness and criticized myself for it, but the truth is that I don't have a lazy bone in my body. Everything just takes me longer, and I don't always meet deadlines. Once I realized I wasn't at all lazy, I started to wonder if I had ADD.

Social security disability insurance (SSDI) gives her a monthly stipend but it's not really enough to pay for much. Her husband works 50+ hr weeks to pay for the medical bills, house, etc. But she has been steadily getting more and more depressed. I don't worry for her safety but when I bring up talking to someone she explains it away with ""we don't have the money for that."" 

She has always been a rather active person, loving outdoors, her gardens, keeping her home clean. But since her back surgery she hurts so much and gets sick all the time so she can't do what she loves. All she wants is a purpose or something to love doing again.

So I'm hoping someone here knows a way to get help either through SSDI or another government agency to help her pay for the help she desperately needs.

This is my first time writing here but I am looking for any input. Thank you in advance. 

Sorry for any grammatical errors, I am absolutely exhausted. 

I am struggling so much with my mental health, which is now making me physically ill. I have been pushing through for the past 8 years but recently I have reached my limits. I don't want to disclose the details but things are bad. I desperately want to quit my job that I have started 3 months ago; but I am so so so afraid. 

I want to take the time to get help, properly dedicate myself to my self care and be in a better place both mentally and physically. Time-wise I am wanting to take between 1-3 months. However, I fear that it will make me unemployable in the future.  I am terrified that my current employer will perceive me as incompetent and any future employer will perceive me as incapable.

When I decide to look for work again, the first thing that will be asked in any job interview is why the gap in my resume and why I only worked my first proper paid job for 3 months after finishing my studies. (I am now in my late 20s).  Hence, I will have to disclose my mental and physical health issues in the interview and well.... I think they will judge me..... harshly.... even if they say they won't.  If they compare 2 candidates with similar qualifications, they will most likely choose the one who has not disclosed mental health concerns.  On top of that, I won't have a reference from my previous employer as I worked there for only 3 months.... so nothing to show for during my time there. 

Basically, I fear that taking this time off will unleash a chain of events that will lead to a non-existent career. I have interests, passions and ambition but my mental health is hindering that significantly. Most of the amazing things I have accomplished have painful memories attached to them because of the constant battle with my mental health (during the process of attaining those accomplishments). It's been hell and has taken me to very dark places. So I am thinking to myself enough is enough.

Symptoms began to alleviate if i changed my demeanor that's why now I rely on my changing my attitude and behavior. But i still have heaviness of left side of head, insomnia- i sleep like 4-5 am and that too very weak sleep, can easily wake up from small noise. Memory problems. Lethargy. Sometimes concentration and decision making problems. Please help me decide should i begin with antidepressants again to get rid of these problems or my natural behavioral changes are enough.",12Sep2019,1

137,"I'm starting to look for psychological/psychiatric help for the first time. A grandparent, who's obsessed with health (and I think less trusting of psychotherapy), is forcing an appointment with a place I'll call the 'Health Institute'.
I was open to the idea, but then she off-handedly mentioned that they don't accept any kind of insurance, and that it's 100$ an hour. So I got kind of suspicious and looked it up - it's vague about what they *are*, there aren't any reviews or outside mentions, and the photographs only show a gym (no offices or anything). She only recommends them because they share an office building.

From their website, I'm now a little suspicious of their wording: they analyze you for 30-45 minutes, then develop a 'treatment plan', which I think just means different types of exercise. You're then charged for an $100/hour gym membership. Is this a valid replacement for psychological help? I've never done this before so I don't know if it's unusual.",12Sep2019,1
138,"Hi all,

I am hoping someone can guide me to some resources or provide me with some advice regarding this issue. I hope I utilize the correct terminology and apoligize if I offend anyone.

I live in an apartment within a larger complex in Minneapolis, MN. Since moving here last summer I've noticed a woman who lives in an apartment the floor above mine yells...a lot. And it's hard to ignore because it is very loud.

She always demonstrated these symptoms, however they seemed to subside after a short period of time. Lately it seems significantly worse and I hope I can maybe help her. 

The last 2 weeks I have noticed she is yelling when I wake up in the morning, yelling when I come home from class in the afternoon, and she's yelling when I go to sleep. My partner has even mentioned that twice she's been startled awake around 2am by the woman running down the hallway yelling. 

When I stop to listen I notice the yelling never makes sense, it's total word salad and is often about weird things like Tom Selleck or Bon Jovi. I've also noticed she often plays the same song over and over again.

I've seen this woman exit her apartment a handful of times. She is often dressed innapropriately for the weather (wearing a puffer vest and sweater in the summer heat) and using a broken umbrella. My partner once was taking the trash out and passed by the woman who proceeded to close her eyes, plug her ears, and hum. 

I know nothing about this woman. I feel for her because it's obvious she's living with a severe and persistent mental illness that just seems awful. I cannot imagine how exhausting it must be for her. Is there anything I can do to help her as a total stranger? Can I call a mental health crisis response team to potentially knock on her door? Should I knock on her door? Is there anything that would help?

Thank you in advance.",12Sep2019,3

Every person I’ve gone to thus far has been absolutely bonkers. One woman wouldn’t stop talking about politics and how she’s in a different tax bracket, so I basically had to sit there listening to HER rant about HER problems. Suffice to say, I haven’t gone back.

Another person (we didn’t know this at the time) specialized in hypnotherapy. I’m not saying it doesn’t work, but my parents weren’t comfortable with it and I wasn’t in love with the concept either. So we told the lady that, and she went off saying how we all hypnotize ourselves all the time and she finished by saying, “Don’t worry, I won’t PLAY with her.”

UHHH wait what

Every single time a psych person pulls this garbage, we give up on it. It’s so difficult to find a good psych that works with our insurance and isn’t nuts.

I’m also frustrated with how they deal with suicidal thoughts. Since I’m 17, they pull the whole thing where “If you’re having suicidal thoughts we have to inform your parents and they have to be in the room...”

I’m always confused as to why some people do involuntary hospitalization garbage as well-I’ve had suicidal thought for 9 years and I haven’t acted on it...and now you’re going to force me to be charged thousands of dollars? Don’t you understand that many suicidal people already feel like a waste of resources? It’s all backwards, and because of that policy I’m always worried about speaking about that just in case the psych is stiffer than I thought...

I'm at university for the second time. I failed before, but now I'm older and hopefully wiser.

I'm really trying to stay positive, theres a lot to be excited about. But at the same time I'm anxious for a lot of reasons.

Last time I was at university, it went very wrong. Several things happened in quick succession culminating in a suicide attempt, and then me dropping out. In my self imposed isolation I also lost every friend I'd ever made.

On another note. My hairs been falling out. I went to the doctor who told me it was alopecia and that he couldn't do anything. So far my hairs long enough to cover it, but new patches keep appearing, some as large as 5cm in diameter. I'm both scared and self conscious about it, my hands are shaking just from imagining it; I already felt ugly.

I've been trying to make friends but it's hard. When I'm with people nowadays, the words just don't come out no matter how hard I try. People eventually just move on to talk to someone else.

I feel like little pieces of myself have been slowly falling away, I dont know whos left anymore, I'm a  stranger. I've been trying to get to know myself again, like how I'm writing a novel, and making art just for myself. 

In a lot of ways having no connections to the world is liberating, I feel free to explore who I am in a way I never could before.

160,"Today, I lost my girlfriend of a year for good. We agreed to be friends while I figured myself out in college, and I began catching feelings for another girl. I messed up and decided to hook up with her, as I figure sex as a more platonic thing. This girl got attached, and I had to cut her off. I hurt her and I feel bad, but her and I have also agreed to be friends. I had a full panic attack, coming to a full realization of what I had done, and how badly I had messed up. I immediately went to tell my (ex) girl, to which it hurt her, but she said after time we'd be okay and back together. I have felt absolutely horrible since, and have done everything I can this entire time to make it easier for her, because I still love and care for her so much. Today, somebody told her things about the other girl and I, all of which was misinformation, and she decided enough was enough. I tried telling her otherwise but she wouldn't talk to me. She called me a piece of shit, told me to fuck off, and to never talk to her again.

The kicker about this was in the beginning of our relationship, she said she was so chill that if I ever wanted to have sex with another girl, all I needed to do was ask her. But being me, I couldn't. I was too scared to. I went through all of this and stupidly went behind her back as I started to like this girl.

This girl was my world. I have thrown up multiple times, I've cried all day. I hurt her so badly when all I wanted to do was make her the happiest girl alive. I'm such a piece of shit. I'm empty inside. I fucked up so badly and I don't think I'll ever be able to date or talk to or have sex with anyone else ever again. I feel like the scum that I scrape off the bottom of my shoe. I suck.

162,"I don't know if this is the right subreddit, or what I should even say. There is too much to write it all down. I just feel so alone and depressed recently. I'm beginning to realize again, that I have always been alone. My parents are divorced (both married with another partner now), my mother was an alcoholic and my older brother is a few cities away studying and living with his gf. I pushed a few toxic friends away the past weeks, what probably is a good thing, but it doesn't help to get rid of this feeling. 
Since I was a kid I always had to look out for others. I brought my mom to her bed when she couldn't do it by herself, while my dad and brother yelled at her, or most of the time just ignored it. I had little time doing the stuff a teenager was supposed to do, beside getting drunk myself on the weekends, or as I got older getting really fucking high. 
First my brother left, then my father did. I was all alone with my mum, who I had to take care of. Constant fear if she is still alive when I returned from school. Even though I hated her for what she did to me and herself, I still love her. That's what you supposed to feel for you mum, isn't it? But I'm still not sure.. Despite the chaos I managed to do my A-Levels. I never thought I would live long enough to finish school, but I'm glad that I did. I hoped to earn some praise and attention for this, but no one showed up to my graduation party. No one cared. My mum was too drunk, my father and brother just didn't show up. 
Now I'm living all alone in a house, that was used to be my home with my family. My brother, my father, my mother.. they all left and are all happy now. And I'm really happy for them. Everyone deserves to be happy, but it seems like I'm the exception. Here I am: all alone. My gf broke up with me a year ago, the only constant I had in my life for a short while. The people I would consider my real friends are in a healthy relationship and too busy, or just don't answer me when I message them. All I have left are these traumatic experiences and the pain they left behind. I just want a person that takes me in her arms and tells me, that everything will be alright.

One was some free youth thing held in a church (it wasn’t religious but that’s the vibe). I think it was just counciling rather than therapy though. It was just what the NHS threw at me whilst I could take some pills and wait for CBT. 

The other was CBT which I had for a little bit. 

Didnt really get on with either of them and felt anxious going to them. The later one I didn’t even want to be at but my mum was coercing me into going. I was taking a lot of drugs (weed, acid) at the time as well. 

I’ve grown up a bit now but still feel crap, I’d kinda like to try it again on my own back. 

I found CBT kinda dumb, like he had me playing with these quartz bowls and stuff. A lot of it felt like nonsense (I also find it weird how they separate thoughts and feelings). Also neither of them really understood me being trans (although I haven’t transitioned) and I just got the stupid patronising “Oh, I have a friend who is trans” and other cliché stuff.

It was such a flashback to the days before the diagnosis, therapist and medications.  I thought I needed to move quickly and started reaching out to his current therapist, his previous therapist and anyone I thought might be able to connect with him because I was failing at it.

This morning his old therapist reacted in the same panic in which I had contacted her.  She  was going to set up an appointment, me me this afternoon and set up an appointment to work with him.  However, that is not what happened.

Luckily she stopped and thought about the panic I had ensued and she came to her senses and called me.  She not only called me but she called me out and was so on point with her assumptions.

She stated that she could not be his band aid and that if he is reacting in the manner he is that he is reacting to his environment.  At first I rationalized that she was wrong but she began asking questions about me.  She said I bet you're not taking care of yourself, are you?  I bet you are not eating right, caring for yourself and managing your own anxiety. What you are doing is projecting your own anxiety onto him and in return it's causing you to be reactive to his anxiety.   

It took me a moment to take in what she was saying.  I knew I was struggling mentally but I had been so focused on providing him with support that I had been neglecting myself and my responsibilities.  She was right, God she was right.  I have allowed myself to forget that my needs matter and that not everything can be fixed or perfect.   I needed someone to tell me to back down and do my own mental health check.  Parenting is hard but parenting with anxiety and having a child who needs constant patience and a strong example is even harder.  Shout out to the parents out there who go through this struggle.

171,"Hello,

We are Psychology researchers from Deakin University, Australia and we are looking for participants for an online experiment investigating cognitive factors in OCD.

Please read below for more information (e.g., background information, what the experiment will involve, reward for participation, etc).

**To participate, please click** [**here**](https://researchsurveys.deakin.edu.au/jfe/form/SV_0ffVVkH26yuvndr)

&amp;#x200B;

1.	What is OCD?

\-Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is one of the most incapacitating mental disorders and majority of the individuals with OCD often suffer from the disorder for lifetime. 

While there are treatment options available, the prognosis is less than ideal, which is why it is crucial to refine the cognitive models of the disorder to improve treatment effectiveness for OCD.

As it has been found that the majority of the general population also experiences symptoms of OCD to some extent, we are looking for participants in general population to investigate cognitive processes related to OCD.

2.	What will the participation involve?

\- Completing an online experiment where you are asked to read some vignettes while identifying any spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, or awkward expressions.

\- Answering a couple of questions about your view of the situation in the vignette after reading each vignette.

\- Completing a series of questionnaires about your self-view, cognitive style, OCD relevant symptoms, and depression symptoms.

\- All information will be anonymous and results will be grouped when it is published, therefore it is not identifiable (more information is available in the link).

3.	What else do I need to know?

In order to participate, you must be over 18 years old, speak fluent English, and have access to the internet.

Some questions about sensitive topics (e.g., clinical symptoms, moral dilemmas, threat-related situations in the vignettes) will be asked in this study. 

If you are uncomfortable with this and/or if you have OCD, you may wish not to participate.The study is expected to take approximately 30 - 40 minutes.

To thank you for your time, we are giving you a chance to win an Amazon voucher (equivalent to 40 AUD)!

173,"Im a 24 year old woman and im severely depressed. I stopped therapy 3 months ago because my therapist retired and now I can't afford any therapy. My room mate is moving out leaving me with more bills on my end and now I wont even be able to afford 1 session a month. I looked at betterhelp and other online alternatives but they are even more expensive than my copay would be. I owe $155 to my old therapist anyway so I can't find a new one until I pay that off but I can't fucking afford it, and on top of that an almost $500 exhaust leak in my car that I also can't afford to pay, I couldn't even pay my car insurance this month. I'm trying to sell my art on the side to help with life expenses but I've only sold 1 painting to a friend in the half a year I've had my store open so that really hasn't gone anywhere. I don't even find it fun to paint anymore, whats the point? I already have like 20 paintings that no one wants sitting in a rubbermaid tub, I don't need to make anymore and its not like they make a difference to anyone anyway. Plus all the painting supplies are too much money.  It just feels like help and self care are only for those who can pay for them. My work does offer 3 free therapy sessions, but thats only 3 sessions. I need something permanent that I can afford. People keep saying to me ""You need the help dont worry about the price right now we can think about that when you're healthy."" but whats the point? Why would I get help now and end up being stressed about having too many late payments later? And I feel like even if I could afford the help what is it really going to do for me in the long run? I'll still be depressed just maybe a little less depressed, but I'll still have to fight this feeling again at one point. I dont want have to keep fighting the same monster over and over again for the rest of my life. I'm done fighting. I dont care if I win anymore I just want the fight to be over.

&amp;#x200B;

on top of all of this too I work in mental health. I'm the call center person. I get yelled at daily for things that I have no control over. I'm constantly interrupted and no one ever listens to what I have to say, coworkers and clients. I haven't gotten through a single phone call today without being cut off. I'm so tired of it. I just want to be able to talk and be heard but no one cares enough to do that for me.

174,"The conversation went well, but he also broke it to me that a new position would be posted and I will most likely not even be considered.

I work very hard, despite my mental health issues and put out great work. But older folks in my office hate me and treat me like shit. I’ve been rewinding all my mistakes in my head.

I probably won’t get the change, but part of me regrets even asking. I don’t want to spiral down.",12Sep2019,1
175,"Ever since high school, I’ve felt like this. I used to have a best friend he blocked me a few days ago  because he didn’t feel like dealing with peoples shit. My girlfriend doesn’t even treat me as a priority at all. Like for example she won’t answer my a text or a Snapchat for 2 hours sometimes when she’s doing nothing really or on ft with one of her friends. If we end up ft late at night around 10 she’ll constantly put me on pause to go answer her friends but she never bothers to answer me. At school, she literally treat me like I’m not even there and just talk to her friend. And if I try talking to her she won’t hear me talking. My parents leave me at the house constantly with little food to eat, and if I ask for food they tell me to eat eggs. I can’t eat eggs for dinner 4 times a week. They barely do anything for me. I haven’t been to a hospital for a checkup in years. They never bother to take me to a dermatologist, or if I get sick they won’t take me to a hospital. I’ll sit at home and wait until I get better. I had a sinus infection and stomach infection for 2 weeks. they bought me some allergy relief. Is something wrong with me for feeling this way, am I being overdramatic? Or am I possibly depressed or something",12Sep2019,1

177,"it’s taken me 6 years to finally realise that talking about your problems/feelings is a lot more helpfully than i used to think. i’ve been attended multiple groups in the past couple of months where i have met people who have similar problems, (maybe not the same reasons why.) 

I know going out and talking about things can be scary especially when you’re used to being by yourself all the time, but working up the courage and telling a group of strangers that i felt like shit and had constant suicidal thoughts, was the best thing that i ever did, and i’ve met 20+ people who are in the same boat! 

Get out there and share your story and you won’t feel as alone anymore ☺️",12Sep2019,2
178,"*Long Post*. So as the title states, I’m going on my first vacation from work starting on Sunday. I’ve been looking forward to it for a month, but now that it’s almost here, I’m scared of being alone. Before I got the Job, my parents would go to Florida and I’d stay home, which lead down a very bad mental path. So I’m afraid of that happening again. To such an extent that, when they leave, I may not have anyone come over due to the fear of being caught in a down moment. I’ve made plans with my Brother and some other friends, but I’m still afraid of the down time. 

How am I supposed to deal with my bad moments when I’m all alone? I’m asking this as a question, because I don’t honestly know. If anyone else deals with something along these lines, I’ll take any advice anyone could give. I’m horrified of being alone.",12Sep2019,1
179,"I dont care how people. I day some really fucked up shit and people get mad. Logically I understand why people get mad but its how I feel and I think it's funny. Whether it's death, misfortune or people being stupid. I thinks Its funny and I'm very honest",12Sep2019,0
180,"I’m currently in the midst of a bit of a mental health crisis. A combination major depressive episode and increase in anxiety related problems. It started a few weeks ago and despite a change in medications it has yet to respond. My work is suffering, I can’t focus, i can’t think sometime, my motivation is shot, I can’t retain things, some days I can’t even leave the house and call off. I’ve been making more mistakes, I even screwed something up pretty badly today because of a completely boneheaded error. I had ample opportunity to catch my mistake and i just didn’t see it. I don’t know what to do, I can’t just take time off because all the problems are still there, I can’t call off anymore because that just puts me behind and makes everything worse. I feel lost and coworkers are starting to notice although I think they probably just think I’m stressed out. 

We have an employee crisis program, and my doctor proposed intermittent FMLA but I don’t know if I should or even if it will help. There’s no turning back when I notify them of my issues. I don’t know what to do.",12Sep2019,2
181,"I've recently been made redundant and my mental health has taken a turn for the worst where I'm thinking I'm done with this and don't want to continue on.

I call a number a friend gave me for mental health services in her area which is 15 minutes away from me. It's a charity and goes to voicemail and gives the number for the crisis team which also goes to voicemail. These are both meant to be 24 hours. I get a call back from the crisis team an hour later to find I'm not in their catchment area so they don't have my notes and there is no crisis line for my area. At least 2 weeks between appointments and only offer group therapy which I don't find helpful. There is a 3 year wait for one on one therapy and you can't have any treatment in that time.

I have tried everything from samaratans to A and E and they were not helpful. I don't know what more I can do. I'm unsure of whether I can get help out of catchment area as Barnsley's mental health team is part funded by the council or something along those lines?

I'm trying so hard to hold on but I'm not sure how much longer I can if there isn't help out there.",12Sep2019,1
182,"So I’m currently going through a pretty dark period of my life. I’ve always been pretty depressed and anxious and just recently learned I have some OCD tendencies. I was unemployed out of college for like 18 months while looking for a job in my field of study. Within the past 2 months my gf of 3 years broke up with me and I started a new job. The gf aspect has messed with me the most and find myself unable to sleep at night and crying almost every day now. I legit haven’t slept in 36 hours which makes work a living nightmare especially since I’m new and it’s an actual office job. 

I have been thinking about going on an anti depressant and I’m curious to know how it effected you personally?",12Sep2019,2
183,"i have had very bad social anxiety and what i think is moderate depression for some years. i did go to therapy for a while but my mom would only agree to take me to this christian place and just. eh.

anyways my mental state is never stable and i have multiple anxiety attacks a week. i always seem to be dreading something. i am also extremely. excruciatingly. lonely. i crave connection and friendship so so bad. but i cant do that due to the social anxiety

my parents think the only way to deal with this is to tell me to just stop letting the worry control my mind, or telling me to pray about it, or telling me it’s not a big deal.

i’m really miserable.

im 16, 17 in two months. is there any way i can see a psychiatrist and get a prescription on my own?",12Sep2019,6
184,"I've had very bad experiences with non White people, I feel they are very ungrateful, rude, arrogant, fraudulent, dishonest, two faced and deceitful in my many experiences living in London. The only thing that's stopping me getting revenge against them is that's it's illegal, but if we ever get a true nationalist leader that allows us ethnically cleanse the non White invaders I'd be the first to take their lives even if they are elderly or children as they don't care when they target Whites who are children, elderly, poor, homeless or even disabled.",12Sep2019,1
