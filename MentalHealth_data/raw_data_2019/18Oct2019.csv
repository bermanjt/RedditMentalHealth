I tried talking to him about it and he just dodged all the questions, so i asked why was he sad and he kept teling me he was mad at everyone but not me and two of my friends. then i asked him what did they do and he answered thet it wasn't their fault... I don't know what to do to help him and im scared. We're 13 almost 14 if that helps.",18Oct2019,0
1,"I’ve never posted before, but I really need tonight now because I’m afraid.
Im a 35 year old woman, I have anxiety and depression and I don’t have health insurance. I’m having a hard time right now with everything. When I say everything, I mean everything... little things like my internet installation not working out days in a row. I have a job that I used to like but they’ve added so much to my workload I can hardly keep up. I feel like I can’t catch a break on anything. Mhy mind tells me every day to stay home from work... but lately I’ve been going to a darker place. I don’t want to even wake up anymore, I’m just tired of life beating me up all the time.
I want to check myself into a hospital or something but I’d fall behind on bills and then I’d be in an even worse spot than I am now. 
I hide my illness really well. My family right now thinks I’m fine and i would just let them down if they found out I’ve let myself go this far. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. 
I don’t know what I’m doing on here, or what I’m looking for.
I feel like I can’t handle it on my own anymore but I don’t have anyone to talk to who understands.

I haven’t been this afraid of myself in years",18Oct2019,1
2,"Junior in high school, horrible procrastinator.  Feeling like nobody really understands me, at this small town high school. I cant gather enough of an interest in my studies to actually do well in them, I want to do well so badly but somehow I always let my grades slip. Not sure whats wrong with me. I have friends but they dont really get me, I could talk for hours about all the art and music I devote my time to and theyd just want me to go back to making jokes. Man I really thought I was like onto something, like I was talking to a person who really understood what I was saying but then I got this look that I'm so familiar with like they thought I was unstable or something. I just need something that will get me through high school. Literally anything. Cause everyday it looks more bleak and bleak and everyday I have to struggle to explain another shitty grade, I really cant take it. I think about public suicide a lot, mostly from like a creative viewpoint but also something about that scene from Ken Park where the kid shoots himself in the skateboard. Is my life really gonna suck terribly if I dont do well in high school? Its something totally different, its not that I dont want to do my work or that I'm lazy, I have dreams and I have so many aspirations and I want to do well but I lack the motivation to do this kind of stuff every day. I probably sound like such a dick and youll probably just tell me I need to get over myself, I'm just frusterated. This happened my sophomore year, I failed two classes which isnt as bad as I thought it would be. My father, who has custody of me, uses stress as a motivator. If I have a bad grade he'll just ask me ""Why? Why would you do this? Why would you have this grade?"" when he knows I dont have an answer. In a lot of ways I hate him. Tell me I'm a lazy prick or give me advice, tell me how I can make it, if I will make it, what I can do. I need something like right now, I need to know its worth it. Thanks for reading this far I guess, never vented to strangers on the internet before.",18Oct2019,5
3,"I'm prescribed clonazepam - only 0.25 mg a day. But omg my memory is terrible. I can barely remember my week. So when it's time for therapy, I barely know what to talk about (it's also interesting because I had trouble remembering my week before clonazepam - I'm also on Depakote ER which I think messes with memory too - but it's definitely worse now. This past week it's been even more worse and the only difference is that I was on my period so Idk if that made things worse somehow or what).

Maybe I need to start keeping a journal. But I also have a tendency to forget things seconds after thinking them (although eventually I do remember, usually within a few minutes of forgetting). I feel like IN GENERAL I have trouble remembering my day (and I had that issue before clonazepam) but if I think about my day right now I remember an okay amount.",18Oct2019,0
4,"Well, this is embarrassing and awkward but I'm trying to do this for myself as well as for others of lost innocence. I made a short video, this is in no way self promotion. I do not care if my video gets likes or anything of that nature. My video is very crappy and I look and sound awful but my point is to let people know they aren't alone and that they can be happy. I hope its okay to share it , it was cathartic and it was very very hard for me to do. I just want to help myself and help others that have been through this. Anyways this is my shitty video and though its very embarrassing and hard to share I just hope it helps at least one of you out there.

5,"I am a voice impressionist. I have been doing voices, new and old for the longest time. However, with each new one that comes. It becomes a part of me. A voice in my head as well. I haven't used my real voice in years. It's lost! No matter how hard I try. If my normal voice uses just a slightly different pitch. Another character starts talking. Some are triggered, like when I burp. Rick from Rick and Morty is my voice. I also take on some of there personality traits. No matter how many times I get yelled at to stop. I still retain the personality but the voice changes for the moment. It's like one big council in my head. It's why I can't get a girl friend. Why I am seen as a freak. I want it to stop. It's ruining my life!!!! Help!",18Oct2019,9
6,"I’ve been doing rather well in my life up until recently. I have a general idea of where this comes from, with the holiday season just around the corner, my working environment can be rather stressful and that normally sets my mind down a “pity and guilt fest”. I’m just afraid of losing myself in this time of year. It’s happened most of these past few years, but after the progress I’ve been making, I just fear that I may slowly begin to lose it as time goes by this next little while.",18Oct2019,5
7,"For 4 years since starting university I haven't had normal mental health for various reasons ranging from social loneliness to death anxiety. But currently I'm stuck in a very weird problem and my mentality is honestly malfunctioning.

So essentially, for 3 years at uni I totally struggled to make any friendships, I got terrible depression and my grades went to ruin. Last year things turned around, I started doing good in studies again and met my current best friend.

For a socially-incapable ASD person like me, surprisingly her and I had a lot in common and we really connected. She and I became quite close and life was good for some time. I did end up falling in love, and was turned down, and that hurt a lot, but currently it's a somewhat separate issue.

Mostly I asked her out because I genuinely liked her, but a part of it was a desperate gambit to keep her around a bit longer. It's the first real friendship I experienced in ages and I am terrified to lose it. This year we have many of the same courses, and next year, not so much, and it's actually influencing my choice of electives because I desperately want more chances to be with her.

But I am certain my concerns with our friendship has become obsessive and unhealthy. I would frequently check Facebook to see if she said anything to me. I would get frustrated when I get messages from other people because I thought the notification was her. When she doesn't come to uni I feel like shit, and as even as I write this I'm literally looking out the window to see if she'll come to class today.

I know this is weird and wrong. If she knew she'd probably be somewhat freaked out. But I don't know, my brain seems broken right now. Help.",18Oct2019,7

There's no reason for me to feel so incredibly awful, but I still feel like shit. Treatment isn't working. Coping skills don't work.

11,"This is really just me venting and letting it all out. I’m just tired, not tired or living necessarily but just tired. Over the last few years, my life hasn’t panned out the way I would like. The first major knock was my final year of university. I have always suffered from anxiety, but it really amplified ten fold during uni. As a result i stopped going to lectures, got sloppy grades and needed a deferral to finish assignments in order to graduate. Because of this, I could not graduate with my class and had to wait a whole year (graduated this July).  Post uni depression really hit me, especially after I didn’t get the grades I wanted and i had to wait to graduate. The last year i have been in jobs that I genuinely don’t care about, that don’t stimulate me in the slightest. I was unemployed for about 5 months until i my dad got me a job at Nando’s (he’s a manager). Because of my anxiety, i find it extremely hard to work and often fall ill and/or call in sick. I failed probation and was fired after 3 months (not by my dad dw, he didn’t work at the same one as me). In a way i was kind of relieved because i hated going to work, but this had left me in a vulnerable position. When I’m not busy, I over think and then my anxiety consumes me. I was fired mid/end of August and i was on the fence about going to uni to do a masters after a year of being away from education. I ended up applying extremely late to uni, (last week actually) and basically begged to be let onto the course due to not having very good grades or very good references. I was thankfully accepted which i am so grateful for because the course director decided to give me a chance. I get extremely stressed and during the application process my anxiety was disgusting. Anxiety sufferers know can relate, you know that feeling when you’re just on edge all the time and afraid for no reason... this was me (still is me) and i find it hard to get out of that state of worry. I am due to start attending uni next week and I’m so anxious because I’m a month behind (wish me luck) but today something happened that just made me break down. My student finance fucked up, my student accom fell through and i started stressing again. Earlier i was sat down and I just scratched the middle of my head. I felt a bald patch :) i went to investigate and realised that it was fucking huge. My little sis took a pic and showed me and I didn’t even know what to think. I have Trichotillomania so i do tend to pick at my edges and baby hairs but not the hairs in the middle of my scalp so i knew it was probably down to stress. Then i remembered when i woke up this morning and i had a tuft of hair in my hand from when I scratched my head. Told my bf and he joked about it, didn’t get why i was so bothered and I just broke down. I know that my stress is killing me, my anxiety is doing way more to my body than i realised and I don’t want to fall into an even bigger downward spiral than the one I’m in. I’m just sad, I’m scared and I don’t know what to do with myself. All this may not seem like a big deal but obvs there’s way more but I’d need a day to even type up all that. I don’t like sounding ungrateful when i know people have it worse than me but I’m just really upset and i cant seem to make this uneasy feeling go away.",18Oct2019,3
12,"I’m getting nostalgic over friendships I never had. I had friends in elementary and middle school but we were never super close. We got along fine but they weren’t the type of people you went to for help or support. In high school I didn’t have any friends until senior year but it was the same situation. I always crave the type of friendships you see in movies and shows like Super 8, It, and Stranger Things. It’s so hard making friends when you’re older and as someone who just graduated high school that scares me. I feel so lonely and I’m afraid I’ll always be lonely.",18Oct2019,0

15,"My ex girlfriend used to always bring it up, but now I’m starting to believe it. Yesterday my APRN that prescribes my medicine said that she doesn’t want to see me because I don’t fulfill my side of the patient provider relationship. She said I take in too many self destructive activities like not eating, not taking my medicine, and not talking to my therapist. It reminded me of the whole bpd thing my ex brought up and how she said it seemed like I’m self sabotaging myself. Besides that, our relationship was very rocky. We’d argue often and I’d bounce between being all over her to being distant. I’d always ask if she was going to leave me or not. She says it’s like I live in a fantasy world since I believe nothing is ever wrong, but I’m always scared everything is going wrong. I do tend to think that there’s nothing wrong with me though despite having depression and anxiety. My mood swings a lot. I can go from feeling fine to really down to severe panic attack out of nowhere. I do idealize self harm and suicide, but never went through with them. I’ve been really tempted with self harm lately though. My self image is also unstable. I tend to think I’m the worst and won’t amount to anything, but sometimes my ego gets big and I think I’m the best. I continue to think I’m ok though, but now I have doubts. I should really talk to my therapist about it, but I fear I may have borderline personality disorder.",18Oct2019,5

17,"I am doing better now. I have been taking my medication and haven’t needed to talk to a therapist for a few months. But for some reason, I miss the person I was when I was depressed.

Quite frankly, I was kind of disturbed. Before I really started getting better, I was depressed, angry, and I wanted to take it out on others. I had thoughts about harming others all the time (but I never did), and I was so used to the thoughts that I kind of enjoyed feeling that way. I miss it. I guess I feel like that part of me is trying to come back; maybe because I’ve been so bored doing well.

I don’t have anyone I feel comfortable enough to talk to about this. Obviously my parents know about my mental illness but I have no friends that can relate. When I was doing poorly I always wished I had a friend who felt the same as me. I know that couldn’t have ended well but it’s all I used to want.

I don’t know what triggered this feeling of longing for the old me. I used to follow a lot of accounts on YouTube and iFunny who posted about killers and mass murderers because I thought they were like me, but when I went back and looked at all these peoples accounts, they all seem to have moved on. This just makes me feel more alone.

Sorry for the long post. I need someone to talk to, though. I feel very alone and kind of empty, like something in me is missing.",18Oct2019,2
18,"i keep having weird dreams. i asked a couple of people about them and what they meant and they all said the dreams were really bad signs and i wa sin danger. the first dream i was washing my face and my head fell in the sink and i fell in and it turned into a giant ocean.

Blood started coming from the ceiling and i passed out on the floor and woke up. the worst part is every time i wake up im in a different spot. ive woken up in my bathtub with water all over the floor. Ive also woken up in the chimney, on the roof, and my old school. ive also been hallucinating alot. this is the weirdest one. I was in science class walking im from the bathroom and i looked at my wrist and i had slit my wrist and spiders were coming out climbing everywhere i scratched them away and looked up and the lighting was dark, like someone had turnes the vinagette up all the way on a photo. my teacher was drinking water and it looked like she was drinking blood in slow motion. my friend snapped me out of it and i looked at my wrist were the cut had been and ut was bleeding from how much i scratched it. it there a mental condition for what im experienceing. every time i try to tell my mom, i feel like my mouth is sewed shut and i hear voices in my head telling me theres only one way to shut them up-death. i rsally need help but cant get it.",18Oct2019,2

20,"I'm just writing down whatever comes to my head. Ive never gone to see anyone or talked to anyone about this. This is actually the first time I've posted to anyone or anything about it. Lately I've been feeling real shitty again. I've started to drop back into my bad eating habits, not that they were ever perfect but I increased healthy eating a lot before and lost some weight and felt great about it. I've had no motivation to get out of bed most days and when I do I find myself only making it as far as the couch in the living room. No matter how hard I try and convince myself to do the simple things I have planned for myself. I get sudden urges of my body feeling extremely tense and my heart feeling like its gonna burst out of my chest while running random scenarios in my head about different aspects of my life when there was nothing to cause it. Aspects like my future, my relationship, my friends and more. Makes me wanna curl up and sleep forever. I get those urges and for no reason feel like those around me that love and care about me are actually slowly drifting away from me or not caring. when deep down I know they care, I know they love me. And in the act of these urges I force my ""love"" and ""affection"" on these people to the point of them getting sick of me or actually pushing me further away. Which causes me to feel like I need to try harder to show them my love. I make very impulsive decisions. Not like physically hurting someone or robbing a store, but doing things like looking thru stuff without asking someone or saying something that might hurt them. I forget things. Like not just normal a little thing here a little thing there. Like look at my phone say I gotta do something turn around and forget. Or tell someone something multiple times in a day or week to where they get irritated. Fuck man. My head feels like a blender of nails and dirt with the occasional burst of light. The worst part about this is I have absolutely no reason to feel the way I do. I have the best mom a son could ask for. Absolute best. Shes the strongest woman I've ever met. I wouldnt be the slightest where i am today without her. I have the grandparents someone could only dream of having, they've helped me through life like no other granparent. They are the picture perfect grandparents. They all do so much for me I'll never in my life be able to repay any of them. And the girl, man let me tell you about the girl. Shes glistens in her beauty, she radiates absolute joy into my soul. Theres nothing that makes me happier than running my fingers through her gorgeous blonde hair. Her immensely blue eyes are a chanel of captivity that suck me in like sunlight to a flower. Dont get me started on her smile. She has a smile that could light up an entire coastline on a gloomy day. A smile that no matter how bad the day, makes me forget about it all as pure happiness overtakes my body. A day feels like a lifetime without her. She has the physical being of a goddess and the soul of the strongest warrior. The perfect girl. The girl I want to grow old next to. The girl I wanna build the perfect life with. The girl I'm slowly pushing away being the way I am...

I self destruct. I wish I knew why, I try my hardest but in the act of doing so seem to makes situations worse. I always feel like when something's going good that there is bad coming. No matter how perfect the situation, my brain tells me bad is coming which makes me worry so much it causes it's own kind of bad. I just wanna know what to do. I just want someone to tell me how to do it, not just how to be happy but how to stay happy. How to not worry so much. How to be more grateful for what is in front of me. I dont wanna loose the people I have in my life. And I feel like I lay it all on there shoulders. I dont wanna be a burden. I feel like I'm dragging people down with me. I feel like I'm loosing a battle with myself and I just wanna be able to control it. I wanna be able to help those around me and make them happy. I wanna help them when they're down, I dont wanna drag them down. I wanna be one of the reasons they all smile. Which is bullshit because I know I already am. But I wanna stop hurting people without trying. Dammit all I just wanna be normal",18Oct2019,1
21,"I don't know how I feel. I've been interested in doing that for at least 10 years, but I never managed to do it for several reasons. I feel confused about what is wrong with me, but I feel I've been living my life in a functional way barely enough for nobody notice I'm broke, but not really accomplishing anything. I have periods of great sadness without any specific trigger, where I can barely get out of bed. 

I have a hard time with routine, I struggle with social relations, I have a disordered eating habits, sometimes I have hallucinations of things getting out of proportion or of falling, sometimes I spend days melancholic fixated with the idea of death. I don't know – it's years and years of issues overlapping. I also have a very unhealthy relation with my best friend/ex-boyfriend, mostly because I've been pouring all those problems on him for years and he is really a good person and try his best, but I became very dependent on him and sometimes I became very anxious over him not answering and such... it used to be worse but still is far from optimal. Other from him, I have mostly distant and difficult relation with people, mostly I feel I never really like anyone.

Well, so I went there today. It didn't started well. The reception was so messed, the girl at the receptionist was sort of rude to me. I felt really uncomfortable, almost left but I decided to stay. The psychiatrist was friendly, asked things and the conversation flowed well. I concentrated mostly on my anxiety and how I tend to feel paralyzed, my hardship on concentrating and finishing tasks and my stress eating. I didn't felt comfortable to mention the death fixation. 

Then he gave my prescriptions for three medicines. Alprazolam, Fluoxetine and Topiramate. He mentioned it would be low doses, that I should take them and return in 30-40 days and we would adjust the meds. I asked about side effects, he told me that I should take them and we could adjust it later. I also mentioned I was interested in doing therapy with a psychologist (I need a referral from him, due to health insurance policy) and he said we could discuss it when I return. 

I feel conflicted about it. I don't know if it was normal, I just feel strange about having a bunch of meds to try and how the end goal seems to find a combination of medications that will make me function, but without really investigating what is the issues behind it. I'm afraid I'll get dependent on the meds and won't really discover what is off with me or ever heal out of it. 

I'm thinking about maybe looking for a second opinion, but I'm unsure if maybe it will be the same as maybe this is just normal or the very function of a psychiatrist?",18Oct2019,4

My group is looking at the mental health attitudes of active duty military, veterans, and civilians. Right now we don't have many responses from active duty military or veterans, so we would love for anyone who is active duty or a veteran to take our survey! Everyone else is welcome to take this survey as well! Also please share this with others (especially active duty military/veterans!) if you'd like! This study is being conducted as a class project for a Senior Capstone course in Psychology at UNCW. There is a POC (Dr. Erica Noles) who can provide you with the study results in December if you'd like. Everything is completely anonymous and we do not collect any personally identifying information about you. The purpose of the study is to understand factors that predict attitudes towards mental illness and mental health treatment. Your input is highly appreciated :-)

Recently I’ve gotten concerned with my thoughts. At certain points I’ve really considered pulling fire alarms or doing something bad and it is hard to fight my thoughts.

Have any of you ever had something similar to this happen to them or someone they know",18Oct2019,3
25,"I hate talking about this but I'm desperate at this point.  This'll be a long post because I have no one I can tell this information to.  This is essentially my last hope.

  I want to go back to the beginning.  My parents met at I believe my dad's work, but who cares.  They were 11 years apart in age, my dad being older.  My mom had it rough growing up and also (I suspect, anyway) is bipolar and antisocial.  My dad grew up in total poverty and also had it rough, but in different ways.  His dad was an abusive drunk and was a physical and emotional burden.

  My mom used a lot of her ""tactics"" (humor, sex, and pretending to be nice) to basically get to my dad's money.  I even recall her calling him her ""sugar daddy"" when I was little.  My dad fell for her scheme, and as he made clear, they accidentally had me.  My mom claims I was intentional, and I suspect that was because she wanted child support.

  So here is where the shit really hits the fan.  Growing up, most of my memories of my parents are them fighting.  My mom took out her raw emotions on both my dad and me.  I was screamed at, hit, and had my belongings broken and smashed.  I moved out with her when I was 3 or 4, to a small town 200 miles away.  Every other weekend I would drive up to see him.  The abuse continued to get worse now that he wasn't really in the picture anymore.  At least not in my new house.  I still have flashbacks to having to lock myself in the bathroom because I thought my own mom might kill me.  She would scream and slam her fists on the door, and if I opened it I would be greeted with punches and kicks.  On several occasions, I was bruised/bloodied.  You get the idea.

  Fifth grade, she meets some mechanic who makes pretty average pay (much more than she was making since she had no job).  The guy is a lot like her, and eventually they forced me to move into his house (along with her, of course).  I've blocked out a lot of what happened there but I do know that while he was coming to my actual house, I couldn't sleep because they would loudly shower together right next to my room and then have loud sex.  Every single night.  And when I complained, my mom gave me ear plugs, implying that I was the problem, not her.

  During middle school I genuinely wanted to kill them both and then myself.  All that held me back was that I was too scared.  Many people tell me, ""Oh, I'm so proud of you for staying strong and living a good life through all of what you've been through.""  The reality is, I was too scared to face my problems, and now I fear it's too late.  Since middle school (high school senior now), I've been a very bitter and cold person.  Cynical, pessimistic, and critical.  Eventually, numb.  And on top of that, I've lost almost everyone who I cared about.  Initially it was just my lifelong best friend and a couple other guys I had known for several years.  I almost appreciated the loss because it finally meant nothing was holding me back from moving in with my dad (which I did one year ago.)  

  When I moved in with my dad, things only got worse.  Recently I lost my other best friend (we met online, and though I never physically met him or the others from that friend group, we were like brothers).  I've lost my mom, and now I've lost my dad.  He is a complete narcissist who takes out his anger on me.  He gets in my face and tries to scare/anger me and it's making me more hateful every day.  I have nowhere else to go really, the rest of my family is just as insane or doesn't have room for one more person.  

  Currently I have no interest in succeeding, I can't even get my driver's license because he'll throw a tantrum.  I'm in counseling but he INSISTS he has to be there with me or else he's threatened to stop the meetings altogether.  Counseling isn't helping anyway, my counselor just says the same shit every session and it doesn't help that I'm literally on my own.  I hate my peers, I hate my family, and I even hate myself.

It’s just not fair and I know life isn’t supposed to be fair but it’s so incredibly hard for some yet so easy for others. It just doesn’t make sense. Where’s the mercy God is supposed to have. Also why does it seem that everyone with a mental illness has multiple. Is one disorder not enough? Nah I got five. Somehow I’m intelligent with all the shit wrong in my head but I think so slow.

I feel bad that I want to isolate myself from everybody- including him, and it isn’t against him.

31,"So I kinda accidentally have an appointment with a pmhnp (psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner) now... I’ve been searching for a therapist for a few months now with no luck. I got a phone call from this group (apparently my doctor sent a referral there) and they said they take my insurance and they help with the issues I have. I was quite excited since it’s been so hard to find someone. I went in today, did the intake paperwork, but when I got home I realized that on the card it says pmhnp, and I looked it up and realized that they aren’t psychologists. I had just assumed that they would be since the doctor referred me to them and we had talked about my struggle to find a therapist. 

So now I have a couple of concerns. One being cost. I can’t find anything on how much it’s going to cost me. I know my copay for therapists is $20 but I don’t know if this will be different. Another thing is from what I’ve read I’m not really sure how much therapy they’ll actually do. It seems like they focus more on diagnosing and prescribing medications. So do I need to cancel my appointment or will it likely be fine? Does anyone have experience going to a pmhnp before?",18Oct2019,1

38,"Hey sub,

I've been having a rough couple of days lately and don't have anywhere to turn. I don't have any close friends, my extended family is non existent in my life, and the pain was caused by my parents so I can't really talk to them. My siblings are either on my parents side or don't wanna be involved. 

Growing up, I was beat by my middle eastern dad for not doing good in school. I'd be spit on, have kitchen table chairs thrown at me, be slammed into walls, and have chairs thrown at walls so hard that holes were made. This sort of abuse happened for 3ish years during my middle school years. 

My mom and dad both play mind games and expect me to change my attitude and feelings to however they are feeling on that day. They act like I'm a robot who can be programmed to their current mood but it doesn't work like that. I'm a human being who doesn't forget the past. When my mom is pissed at my dad, I'm allowed to be mad at him. But when things are good with them, I better get along with everyone or else. 

Other previous things they've done include:

\-my dad taking me to the middle east against my will so he could find a bride 1/2 his age

\-my dad being embarrassed of my sexuality and me being Christian so he won't tell his family

\-my mom doesn't work and blames me for issues but has no idea how hard real life is

\-my dad maintaining a relationship with his fam, while they've never had one with me

&amp;#x200B;

There's alot more but im too distraught to think and it doesn't make as much sense typing as it does talking in person. I'm just wondering if I take a break from my family, move out of the apartment they pay for and just do things on my own, no matter how difficult it is, will that be a solution?

40,"I’m a teenager. I have no idea if this is normal or if I have some sort of disorder. 

Whenever I feel something major, it controls me.
When I’m angry, that’s all I can focus on.
When I’m anxious, I fear what I’m anxious about like the end of the world.
When my ego is triggered, I can’t help but express my superiority, even if it’s unwarranted and false.
When I commit to a task, I feel like I drank a cup of coffee or something. I’m energized, and I go way too fast.
When I’m sad, only sweets or going to bed can stop me from crying.
When I’m happy, I’m very impulsive and... bubbly, like I imagine how being drunk would feel.(edited)
When I have no emotion, I simply can’t consider threats, risks, or rewards the right way. Nothing seems to have any weight on me in this state. For example, I had a revelation when my parents forced me into my anxiety state, and was convinced that I had to do something about my (yes, very excessive) internet use... but, once I went to sleep and woke up, I didn’t feel like it anymore. 

I can often flip states in just a few seconds. For example, when I started complaining about the noise that one of my parents was making (I was a bit of a jerk, I admit that), while watching TV, they snapped back at me, asking me to help. This instantly got me to my anxiety state. I was afraid of them. 

I was told about a certain contract in advance, in complete detail, and thought “whatever”. Awhile later, when I was told about it again, when I had to sign it, I was quite anxious about it, and barely signed it. 

Is there something wrong with me? I have absolutely no idea what I should feel, or experience. What is normal?",18Oct2019,5

I've transferred one of my courses for December cause I missed half of it. Everything is overwhelming me. I just wish someone told me everything will be fine after this.

44,"When I was young I got anxiety because my mother would yell at me and get angry every time I watched a movie.  My parents always paid more attention to my older brother growing up too, which made me confused and depressed.  He was getting so much attention, he was able to get a phone, a tv, video games, and I had to ""wait until I got older.""  By the way, I thought they would wait until I was the same age he was when he got these things, but instead they waited years... By then it was too late and I was already extremely maladjusted with no way of relating to anyone.  Once they finally got me a phone... It was a flip phone while everyone else had smartphones.  Plus I lived in a place with terrible wifi connection, having to go to school where (most) everyone else was developing normally...  I did not have any way to truly relax growing up, because there was no one I could trust.   My non empathetic brother bullied me and called me stupid, retard, weak, idiot, etc. while knowing that I had no control over my life.  How is it possible to trust anyone after something like that happens?  Well, maybe my parents will help, I thought.  Wrong.  I'm a tattletale now and somehow that's worse to report wrongdoings to try to find someone to show compassion to you than to do wrongdoings as my brother did?  Anyway, it got worse as him and his friends would always call me retard and idiot when I'm around them for not knowing about things I had very limited access to (such as movies or video games, which I was allowed 1 hour a day).  It didn't help that at school narcissists would pick on me and call me weak.  Anyway, I grew up to become very slow in my thinking and learning because of all the prevention of learning that my parents forced upon me.  So the bullies proved to be right in the end, I really was an idiot never did become better, healthier, smarter, stronger, etc.  My mental health seriously declined and I became more introverted, anxious, and depressed than ever.  Now I am in college where the fog is slowly clearing since I finally have freedom to do and learn as I please.  I can seek out help online, since I am living in a city with great internet access.

52,"I’m still processing and I’m sort of in shambles after face-timing this person for about 4 straight hours, so please forgive me while I try to chronicle this total clustercuck. God bless anyone who actually read this. 

My best friend from high school that I grew up with was always a little odd. One of the defining characteristics and idiosyncrasies that always stood out to me is what I now know to be the term “word salad.” 

That is, he would routinely say certain things and use specific words and phrases that either do not make sense, or didn’t apply to the situation he was describing. This happened all the time. It was always very subtle, but was a huge reason that he had a hard time making friends growing up. In addition to this, he always had weird delusions about “his image,” and what people thought of him, but could never articulate why other than the inherent worry of “what people have been saying.” The thing is, I was one of the only friends he had growing up, so this never made sense. 

Okay, that’s the stage for this scenario. 

A few years ago, I lost all contact with him for about 4-5 years. During this time, he deleted his Facebook and Instagram, and I had no idea what happened to him. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago, I march with him on Tinder of all places (he’s straight, so this was very bizarre) and I immediately opened with “Oh my goodness, how are you, I was so worried about you, where have you been all these years, etc etc etc.”

The thing is, he looked absolutely horrible in his profile photos (gained a lot of wait, but still somehow looked very gaunt, sunken eyes, weathered complexion) and my first suspicion from his appearance and the fact that he completely brushed past my concern, was that he was on hard drugs.   

After weeks of bizarre conversations (he mostly communicates through memes, or weird coded and overly pedantic language that doesn’t structurally make sense - ways of speaking that I was mostly used to from knowing him in the past) I finally got him to talk to me over FaceTime. 

It became so clear almost instantly that the issue isn’t at least in large to drugs. 

Things like clanging, word salad, and him admitting that he “can’t hear me over the static of the radios,” and the “noises of what they’re saying.”  — Made me conclude that my friend may have severe schizophrenia. 

During our talk, he showed me around his house. He used to have his own apartment and was always very clean. This time around he had a mattress on the floor, his clothes and belongings were totally disheveled. His bathtub was filled with water that looked like it was there for ages. When I asked him why his tub was full he said “because that’s how you fill your water, everyone knows that.” - I said “what about your sink?” And this idea seemed to offend him. I meant I’m talking total disillusion here, with almost every subject.  

He was drinking grape juice out of a shot glass. He drank hot sauce out of a bottle and then threw up while talking to me. He brought up the subject of beastiality and started to scream about how it’s so evil that people do that to animals.... Dozens of strange behaviors, coupled with a series of conversations that... simply made no sense at all. In between that he would snap back to being lucid. 

After ages of back in forth I asked him if he ever hears voices or sees things. In between every question, his eyes darted around the room and he looked off camera to something that snagged his attention. He shifted subjects constantly. 

Finally I asked him if he knew what schizophrenia was. He said a little. I read him softened definition, and he said that he agreed with it. 

After a while he got very lucid. Enough for me to simply appreciate the fact that the person I used to know was there. I let him know that I love him. That I would never say anything to harm him. Then I told him I think he may be very sick, and that he may need to resources. This sent him back into his delusions, and we continued to cycle back and forth, with me constantly reminding him that his words aren’t making sense. 

Our call ended with me offering to take him out to lunch, or to bring him lunch. And that if we are going to have any friendship, it’s going to be with his mental health in mind, and that would be the angle I’m operating from. 

He made me promise that I would never institutionalize him. But from this exchange I can see that he has absolutely disconnected with reality and even trying to chronical his conversation makes me feel like I have stepped into his world. 

I’m so lost. I don’t know what to do, or if I even have the emotional capacity to handle this situation. Thank you to anyone who read this. I’m going to cry now, because the person I knew was still there, but watching him disconnect from reality in real time broke my heart in half. 

TLDR : haven’t spoken to friend in 4 years. Reconnected. During call he displayed clanging, word salad, paranoid delusions, and a total loss of reality. He seems to have zero support system, but when I asked him about his family, he would snap to being lucid and tell me that he didn’t want to break them up, and that he would rather talk about something fun instead. 

What the fuck do I do.",18Oct2019,23

I don’t have the greatest relationship with my mother, we always fight at least once every second day. I try to remain calm even tho the things she says are hurtful but I make sure I don’t cry or am seen crying by anyone. I feel that I am not allowed to show that I am sad at home cos I’ll get yelled at and a fight will start. I have pent up emotions such as stress, anger and sadness but can never show it. When I’m at school with a friend I have an urge to tell them my problems but I shove them down and try to forget about it.  I’ve noticed I like rainy days and sad music cos it makes me feel sad.  I’m too scared to go to a therapist and if my mum finds out. The last time I cried was 3 years ago and that was due to a break down I had. Sometimes I stay back after school for “homework club” but I go just so I don’t have to go home. I want to feel sad but I can’t.  What’s wrong with me?",18Oct2019,2
57,"My sister has been battling anorexia and bulimia for years now. She's 21, around 5'9"" and her lowest weight has been around 79 pounds in the last year or so. She's moved from an abusive household with my mother to an abusive home with her now ex boyfriend and his mom to our grandparents' home where she is constantly fighting with my grandparents because of her eating disorder.

 She struggled mainly with anorexia around 6-7 years ago but her main problem right now lies with her bulimia. She is constantly stressed and her reaction to stress seems to be to binge and purge. She has no money and has to pay restitution every month for a car accident, a shitty job but no better options at the moment, and doesn't really have anyone supporting her. I do my absolute best to always have her back and stick up for her when no one else will, but it's hard to do when her eating disorder is what's causing a lot of the turmoil in the house. I hate saying that because it's not something she can control, but it also can't be blamed on anyone else. It just is.

 She tends to always overeat and my grandmother always belittles her for she. She and my grandfather will either mock or fuss at her, even if she wasn't planning on purging. But that just makes her more inclined to purge. At this point she's stopped really trying to make peace with them and now responds with sarcasm until they leave her alone, but that just makes everyone mad. Obviously her health is absolutely the most important thing, but my grandparents are both retired and live on a fixed income, so providing for two young adults, one of whom eats almost everything and then throws it up, is very difficult on them.

 And it's not like she hasn't tried to get better. She has a rare clean day where she doesn't do anything, and I give her nothing but praise and support (thought I try to show support even when she slips up). She's tried therapy but there aren't any therapists around that are equipped to deal with eating disorders. She's been hospitalized and in rehab facilities, but nothing has worked. If anything, they just made it worse. They fed her 4000+ calories a day when her body was used to the absolute bare minimum and did nothing for her mental health.

There is also the problem that she's scared to recover because that opens possibilities for people to say she was faking it. Honestly because this is such a difficult thing to understand, a lot of people we know say she's just doing it for attention even though it literally has almost killed her several times. She's scared to recover because then people will say it was never real or that she just drew it out longer so they'd pity her. As much as I wish she could just not be bothered by people like this (including our family and our grandparents that we live with), she's the kind of person to take those things to heart.

I just don't know how to help her. The only person that can really get to her, in all honesty, is me, but I'm also the only one in her corner. I'm terrified of having a serious talk about this and how important recovery is and the impact it's having on everyone else (though it's not her fault) because I'm scared she'll think I'm turning against her. The last thing I want is to lose her trust. I love her more than anything and I just want her to be happy, but I don't know how to help her. She's told me time and time again that she wants to get better, but her condition is so severe that I don't even know where to begin. If it continues as it is, I'm scared I'll lose her entirely. I've tried to explain our situation as best I can but I'll answer any questions needed. Any help or suggestions are very much appreciated.",18Oct2019,4

I think I might have an addiction to alcohol. It was especially bad over the past month and now that the weekend is approaching and I'm scared I'll drink again. I'm doing really badly right now and I'm genuinely afraid of myself, because I feel like I'm losing control. I don't know what the fuck is happening to me.

I feel like I need help right now (have been putting off seeking help for years and it only got worse) and that it would be better if I could spend the weekend somewhere where I'm not alone.

61,"I've decided to use Reddit as an avenue to speak my words. In a world of real struggles there is a pathetic me, I don't even think i'm deserving of asking for opinion on this sub-reddit. 

I am 26 this year.

Quick background. My dad is wealthy, more than enough for me to live comfortably until I die. I developed learning disability growing up (I was told) and I definitely was a late bloomer as my peers matured much faster than I did. 

Growing up with a silver spoon, I can get whatever I want without having to work for it. 

I started to realize I was very different when I left my sheltered life to live abroad and had to meet many different people. Fast forward... I've moved back home after, wasted my life in University overseas, have little to no professional/work experience, stuck doing literally nothing on a daily basis at my dad's company because no one wants to give me work

I feel like its hard to gain respect from seniors and peers when you're being judge for having no accomplishments. Plus it makes it harder for my self-esteem when people will always have certain expectations of you (e.g. you will take over you dad one day or you will become a successful business man in the future). Matter of fact is that I have no skills to survive in the real world because my parents have sheltered me from it. 

Communication is also an issue because I live in a multilingual society (where English is not the mother tongue) but I only speak English because I went to international schools growing up.

I have so much security in life, I literally have no drive to pursue anything.  I feel like an outcast in society. Its my fault that I end up this way but I can't help to question myself if it actually bad parenting that made me who I am. 

I'm borderline mentally unstable (at least I think I am), although its not as bad as it sounds, but I do have frequent mood highs and lows. I also have social anxiety and just overall frequent anxiety which often suppresses me from doing anything. I have improved with mental health (especially moving on from my insomnia stages) but the anxiety still is part of me 

IMO everyone has depression, just different levels of it. 

I may be depressed but its nothing major and I do have passive suicide tendencies especially when i'm alone (e.g. driving). My fear is that one day I might just commit suicide. So many people that commit suicide lived with depression for many years maybe without even wanting to die but still do.  

Look at Anthony Bourdain, fulfilling life, but secretly had underlying depression but he lost to it when he is in his 60s. Same with Chester. You just don't know if the suicide bug will bite you. 

I don't feel like a man, I don't have self-worth, All I have is my dad's money. 

I'm sorry if I wasted your time, I am just frustrated and lost.",18Oct2019,8
62,"For the past 4 months I've been feeling extremely sad. I'm constantly tired, my concentration is basically inexistent, I've been slowly abandoning all my hobbies and losing interest in things I used to enjoy. I've also become very forgetful. I'm only 18 and I turn to alcohol and cigarettes to boost my mood and some would say my behaviour can become unpredictable and reckless. 
I don't want to diagnose myself but a lot of people would suggest maybe I have depression, but I don't know what to do about it. I want to get help but in a small village like mine I can't consult my GP without my parents eventually finding out. How do you choose a doctor and what do I have to do when I call? Say I don't feel well and I'm not sure what's wrong with me? I've never went to the doctors before (hopefully I don't have to anytime soon for anything else) and I'm scared. Please give suggestion and share your own experience!

How do you usually deal with your symptoms? Does it sound similar to your anxiety? Every time I get bloods done and get a general check-up everything is fine, so I know it has to be anxiety. I just don’t understand how it can consistently make you feel so rough. The fact the feeling never goes away just makes me want to cry all the time, I'm so fed up.

73,"Not really linked, hoping the people of this subreddit could use this though: 

Yoo b. Im gonna be blunt. Its likely no one will ever remember you, in lets say 100 years your last records could be wipes from the last database server from some ancestor website because they need to save space. And as peak as that is, i see it in this way: if no one's going to remember me, why should i care?

Whats the point of trying to make others happy when in the end no one will remember. 

Now with that you need to choose what person you want to be. Almost every choice will lead in you being forgotten eventually. However, its not all about that: what is it about? Here and now. Youre here now. Time will always go forward, but no matter what it will never ever go back. 

Theres no point in being upset about whats happened. If you was in the position again: youd do the exact same thing. If you was feeling exactly the same as you did back then, you'd do the same thing. Dont let that hokd you back. Everyone makes mistakes, the diffrence between a mistake and a failure is that a mistake is a mis-take, implying that you retake it. And no matter how many times you make that mistake, as long as you strive to have a good take, youve not let it become a failure. 

You only live once, and regardless of how long you have left, you should enjoy every moment of it. 

Life can be hard. Sure. Harder than you can ever possibly handle. But if you let it bring you down, you can let it bring you up. 

Never give up. Theres one fight youve always been in, one youll always be in. The fught for happiness. Sometimes theres not alot you can do, maybe nothing. But if you can keep yourself happy, no matter how hard it is, if you can stay happy, you're on the way to recovery. Youre on the way to winning. Youre a hero.

And I probably am, somewhat, so I apologize in advance for how annoying this might sound and am prepared and eager to read any comments about the arrogance and potential danger of feeling uniquely any one way. I worry about this a lot and do usually try to combat these feelings when I feel them arising in myself. Right now, obviously, I'm not doing that. If it seems indulgent, I suppose it is.*

My friends were all going around the room today sharing first impressions of each other. When it got to me I was struck by something a lot of them seemed to say about me. Apparently, I have a very ""fascinating"" and ""chaotic"" personality. My friend said when she first met me and got to know me it was like ""1000 different puzzle pieces she was trying to fit them all together""; when she said that, the others all enthusiastically agreed in unison. Then my other friend said her first impression of me was that she could never follow, or predict, what I was about to say, or the way one comment would lead to another and that my intensity and vulnerability fascinated her but also made her uncomfortable. Another said she thought I was the most chaotic and ""layered"" person she knew. Another said there was something ""un-tranquil"" about me. Finally, my ex-boyfriend said I was one of the only people he could not fit into a box/type (he has aspergers).

I've heard things like this my  I thought I usually came across like a sweet, smart, very socially anxious people pleaser and not much more. It's true, I do have a totally crazy side, but I don't EVER deliberately create chaos or drama (I hate conflict, in fact!). I'm pretty much never angry or deliberately hurtful (to others).  It's funny, I'm not mysterious at all, either. I am talkative to a fault and wear my heart on sleeve. And I'm almost always in the dependent, adoring, submissive position. I do act in self-destructive ways. I am also hyper aware of everything going on inside me (and outside me) so that I'm almost always feeling dozens of completely completely conflicting emotions at once, but doesn't everyone do that? 

This almost sounds like I'm bragging. I'm definitely not. I'm genuinely curious about this, and also the origin of this kind of fundamental extra-chaotic way of being and relating. I wonder if anyone here can relate and if they think it's possibly related to a very difficult and unpredictable childhood, or more biological processes, like temperament and even mental illness? I mean they all intersect but I was wondering what popped into your head. It's almost seems like a kind of borderline personality disorder but without the anger and constant interpersonal conflict, like it has more to do with cognition or something?",18Oct2019,1

80,"tw: mention of grooming and heavily focusing on the topic of abuse 

hi so this is my first ever reddit account and post, ive been a lurker for a long time but i just wanted to express something im going through right now. 

im a teenage girl (16) and like most people my age am starting to try and build meaningful romantic and platonic relationships. ive always been an extreme introvert and tend to socially isolate myself often and dont like people in my bubble, but even though im not one for physical affection, ive never been bluntly repulsed by it. however recently its becoming a problem and i think it might be to do with repressed memories? 

as i said ive never been one for being hugged and even sitting directly next to someone makes me uncomfortable, and in the past year or so its been getting so much worse. i feel like this sounds stupid but around 6 months ago i recalled something that happened during my childhood through a dream, i do sometimes dream of past events that have happened so i really dont think i made it up. i dont remember what it was but i woke up and felt like i needed to be physically sick and kept trying to fall back asleep. it was  a really weird feeling of guilt and disgust? i dont remember it much but i know i kept thinking fuck i need to tell my mum and it was a weird feeling realisation that hey that's not normal thats fucked up and i still get the same feeling now remembering it but i dont remember the dream at all and  i think im forcing myself to forget. 

unfortunately like a lot of teens i suffer with depression and anxiety and with that tend to disassociate myself from problems i deal with or simply ignore things until they go away. as i said before im trying to build better relationships with people and for once actually have a crush on someone, but he wants to hold my hand and hug and things, it makes me feel physically repulsed and even sitting with him or making eye contact is becoming an issue for me. ive been talking to my psychologist about it and he keeps asking if ive been through some sort of trauma and asked my parents if ive had an aggressive male present my life before or if ive had some type of trauma that could relate to this. i usually just awkwardly laugh and say no because i dont remember anything happening to me and everyone in my life is kind towards me but i get extremely uneasy when he asks me and have little to no memories of my childhood. i dont even remember my parents from memories before 8. i tend to put that down to the fact i moved around a lot as a child, migrating across europe for most of my early years and usually blame that for my lack of memories as i was too young to make lasting ones amongst all the constant changes. however im really starting to think something happened to me as a child to make me the way i am because i can't shake the feeling its a reason i cant remember anything. i also feel like it could be a factor that causes my internalised homophobia and fear of anything to do with sex, i do know i like girls and boys but im grossed out thinking about either even kissing me on the cheek and fear that this could be to do with a past trauma. 

the main reason i think ive been through something and am forcing myself to forget is that i was groomed by a friend of mine into being sexual with her when i was 13 ( i have dealt with this now, and thought was the root of my dislike towards the knowledge i like girls, however the feeling is more present now ive moved on from this). i was very openly against the idea of ever doing anything, because as ive said i dont like intimacy full stop let alone with someone i have no feelings towards but i didn't see it as abnormal then and forgot that it happened until asked about my friendship with her recently. its making me feel like my brain forces these things away and that its happened before even further in the past?

I don't know what it is these days but I keep experiencing the same emotional / mental cycle over and over.

I start feeling unreal and lightheaded, disassociated from reality, time, matter, everything. And then I get this immense sense of existential horror. Can't stop ruminating about meteors wiping us all out in 5 minutes, super tsunamis, the airplanes passing over my head suddenly take a deep dive and flying into my apartment while I watch the pilot's terrified eyes before the plane smashes into me and splits me into atoms.

I get this feeling of my stomach churning and like there's this ball of concentrated fear in behind my navel just being pressed and pressed harder together, almost like a black hole, until the density is so strong I almost get afraid my entire body will be sucked into it. I know I'm rambling but it's so hard to put into precise words.

And the weirdest thing is this fear again leads to me feeling unreal, almost accepting or wishing for the apocalypse (personal or as a species). Like I get this anticipation somehow and find a morbid interest in experiencing the very few seconds before disappearing into the nothingness.

I suppose im just venting and maybe to feel less alone if anyones been through major hardship and made it out the other end. I got no where else to share really, I keep this stuff hidden as best as I can.",18Oct2019,1
91,"I’ve (f26) always been a very anxious person. I deal with a lot of obsessive thinking and thought patterns. Making my situation worse because I’ve been going out and drinking too much. Pretty sure I’m developing a drinking problem because I black out frequently. I’m petite and don’t eat a lot which doesn’t help. Ended up at a strip club last weekend with friends (only been once before, not a regular thing for me.) Got black out drunk. Spotty memory of me going into the champagne room for a dance (which I know my boyfriend (m30) is okay with as we’ve previously discussed. ) Remember the dancer dancing on me then looking over to realize two guys had followed us in and were watching. Remember one of them coming over and touching my leg, rubbing my thigh. Then that’s it. I know I had all my clothes on. Remember meeting back up with my friends after and telling them some guys had been in the room and touched me, one of my friends got really upset. They told me I was only up there for one dance (5 or so minutes.) 

I told my boyfriend all of this. What I remembered and what I didn’t. It’s been a week and I can’t stop obsessing over what else could have happened while I was up there. I don’t remember touching them back I just remember the stripper dancing on me and hands on my legs, but I’m a wreck wondering if I cheated at all. I can’t think of anything else, trying and trying to remember anything that would make my guilty of infidelity because I just need to know. 

I’m over come by guilt and paranoia. I want to stop drinking and putting myself in such dangerous and vulnerable situations. It’s not fair to myself or my boyfriend, just not sure how to stop obsessing over this incident. I feel like such garbage human. Part of me needs to know/find out because otherwise I feel deceptive or a liar. I don’t know how to cope with not fully knowing the extent of things.",18Oct2019,2
92,"My psychiatrist started me on Lexapro a month ago when I first saw him for depression and anxiety. I told him my brother had tried Lexapro before and that it helped him at first and then he started having increasing suicidal thoughts so he had to stop taking it. I was apprehensive to try Lexapro specifically because of this, but doc said it was a good option for me, so I decided to give it a shot. 

Turns out, Lexapro works the same way for me as my brother. Worked great for about a week, helped my anxiety. But then the suicidal thoughts started and all I could think about was slitting my wrists. I have no history of self-harm thoughts or behaviors. At this point, I sent a message through the portal to my doctor and his assistant's response was to keep giving Lexapro a chance and go to the hospital if my symptoms got worse. I was like okay, whatever, it's early in the game, maybe this will turn around. 

So a week ago, I go in for my next appointment and explain that I'm still having all these side effects and that I'm also going through trauma therapy for PTSD with my therapist, so it's important that I can be stable on my meds to continue that. 

I also asked him for his opinion on EMDR since I was considering starting it with my new therapist but wanted more opinions on it. He went into this detailed account of a patient he had who had been tied up and raped/brutalized for weeks and how she did EMDR and it helped her. I was so triggered by this story I just wanted to get the hell out of there at that point (my PTSD stems from domestic violence history/sexual assault). 

In the end, he said he wanted me to keep trying the Lexapro and that the side effects might get better. So with him unwilling to change the med, I just went home feeling pretty helpless. I had a panic attack and dissociatove episode that afternoon that lead to me giving in to the self-harm thoughts and cutting my wrist for the first time. That night I started weaning myself off the Lexapro because I was terrified I would escalate further and actually kill myself on this med. 

I have already decided I don't want to see this doctor anymore at this point, but the new psychiatrist I'm trying to get in with has a waiting list situation (will likely be doing an IOP through them) and I'm stuck in this spot with no meds to help me really manage my anxiety other than the occasional xanax for panic attacks. 

I sent one last plea for help to the original psych doctor yesterday. The MA messaged back and suggested I just completely stop the Lexapro and see if my symptoms resolve over the weekend and that she would talk to the doctor on Monday about it. This is dumb as hell and also dangerous, because I know for a fact you don't cold turkey quit SSRIs without a replacement because the withdrawal effects can be horrendous. And even if I did just abruptly stop, Lexapo is not going to magic its way out of my system in a day or two. So my symptoms won't just disappear over the weekend. 

Anyway, this rant is long but I was just curious what y'all think I should do because it's like pulling teeth to simply get a different SSRI and the people at my current office are being irresponsible as hell about all of it. I hate to go to the hospital for something that should be handled outpatient, but I don't know if it's safe to keep waiting for this new psychiatrist to call me back. I've cut myself twice more this past week and this whole thing is frankly scaring the shit out of me because I feel like I have no control in this situation.",18Oct2019,6
93,"Hi, everyone.

I hope you’re all well. I’m seeking advice for a dear friend who I suspect is suffering from some kind of mental illness that I can’t identify. We’re both in our early 30s and we’ve known each other for about 12 years now. My friend has always had issues controlling his anger, but over the last 6 or 7 years, his condition has taken a turn for the worst. He also, I think, has just had some *generally bad luck* in his life. There was an arrest that was completely unjustified, several random house fires that destroyed his belongings, his father was thrown to jail (the catalyst for which was, I think, similarly unmanaged anger), he had some romantic partners that were cruel, he had some roommates that took advantage of his kindness. He has very little money and few financial prospects. People sometimes mock my friend in public for some of his physical characteristics. I don’t know why and it’s awful and it gets under his skin.

I see all of this happening and I try to offer him support and tell him I’m sorry about whatever things have happened and that I’m here for him. I believe that he’s been dealt some very bad hands in his life. I tell him that I see how many of these bad things have happened to him and he’s justified in being angry about them.

So, I hesitate in some ways to blame *all* of his problems on mental illness.

However, there’s an obvious pattern of anger controlling his life that has led him down some very unfortunate paths. He’s been fired from 5 or 6 jobs due to not getting along with co-workers and anger in the workplace. Over the past year or so, he’s also had some several very public meltdowns in which he’s tried to ruin property. He’s gotten kicked out of multiple bars in town. All the while, he's venting - criticizing other people he knows for what he perceives as their ""privilege"". The other night, he went on a 3 hour rant about how much he disliked everyone in town (in great detail) and how he's had a bad lot in life. He talked about how he wanted to get in a fight with the next person who talked to him.

My strategy, up to this point, has been to be there for him and to listen to him when he’s venting or going through tough times. I’ve followed him through a couple of rough nights trying to calm him down. When alcohol exacerbated the problem recently, I had to convince him to sleep on my couch instead of driving himself back home. I've decided to not drink around him anymore.

Frankly, I’m afraid of him much of the time and I’m afraid that if I suggest to him that he might have mental illness that it will send him off the deep end and make his problem much worse. I’m afraid that he’ll stop talking to me. I want to help. Not to drive him away.

He’s mentioned suicide several times. Whenever he has, I’ve come to him after the meltdown and offered my support and tried to express my love for him. After a couple of recent meltdowns, I’ve calmly voiced my concern about his anger. I’ve told him about my own experiences with mental illness (I have severe OCD) and about therapy and medication and how it’s worked for me. I researched some therapists in our area who do payment on a sliding scale. I’ve offered to give him these contacts if he wants them. I know that I can’t these force things on him. I’ve brought up the conversation two or three times and he never seems to express interest in actually doing therapy or looking into the possibility of medication. Every time, he just says “you’re a good friend” or something to that effect. I don’t know what he has.

To be perfectly honest, I haven’t spent much, if any, time really researching what he may have because I don’t know if it’s my place to say to him “I think you’re bipolar” or “I think you have borderline personality disorder”. However, the little research I have done seems to point to borderline personality disorder, but I’m not a medical professional. I want him to see someone who can properly diagnose him. I’m afraid, though, that he will react with more anger if I tel him what I think is really going on.

I want to help my friend. Any advice would be much appreciated.",18Oct2019,1
94,"After suffering in silence with severe depression and suicidal thoughts for two years, I had a breakdown at the weekend and finally opened to my wife. She was stunned and supportive, and pleaded with me to go to the doctors and get the help I need. 

I had been hesitant after a failed attempt at getting help in February. The doctor I saw back then saw me and said ""try not to do anything stupid and you'll be fine"".

I relented, realising the damage I'm doing to myself, and my family and booked an appointment. 

A new doctor saw me today and when I explained the situation, he was kind, understanding and made me feel comfortable. 

He's given me the help I need, in the form of antidepressants to deal with the symptoms and referred me to counselling to address the cause. 

But the one thing I took away that completely changed my outlook was this. He looked me right in the eye, and in a calm and sympathetic voice said ""it's not your fault"".

98,"Good afternoon. This is my first post on Reddit, like ever. Having said that, be patient with me. I'll give some background, then dive right in.

I'm 23 years old, successful, and have everything right going for me. I was a college athlete, I've graduated, I've landed good jobs with salary and benefits, I have no loans or debt besides student loans, I live at home, and my car was gifted to me. I've dated literal 10/10's. My family loves me. I have plenty of friends. I have access to mental health care and medication. 

My life is a dream, for some people. I have it made pretty well. There's a problem, though. Every day, I am wildly depressed and feel like I have no purpose in life and that I'm going to feel this way for the rest of my life. I have no joy in anything. Life feels empty, and that I'm just going through the motions. I'm doing what I've been told to do all my life, and that's just fine. I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I used to take medication and see a therapist, but I stopped once summer began. I know I need to get back into it, but the process is taking awhile. 

My depression sparked up again in October of 2018. Since then, I've felt this way every single day. I graduated college in May, moved home, and started fresh. I ran out of medication and stopped going to a therapist because they were located in the town I went to college in. Medication wasn't working, and therapy felt useless because I NEVER felt better after going. I'd gone to therapy for eight years and eventually gave up. 

I've gained 30 pounds, somehow gained ED (yup...that sucks), got dumped by my girlfriend, and feel alone and like a failure. I don't enjoy life anymore. I've tried to get help, and it just doesn't work. I'm going back to therapy and getting on new medication. We'll see how it goes.

My family doesn't understand why I'm so down. I explained to them everything I've said above, and they don't get it. ""You're exactly where you need to be, there is NOTHING wrong. Stop being sad, get help, and grow up."" That is what they tell me. I can't tell my coworkers because my jobs are relatively high profile; if they know I'm struggling, there will be judgement. Furthermore, I fake my happiness at work.

I come home from work and either sleep, get drunk, or play video games. Nothing else. I have no motivation for anything else. I'm miserable and I'm losing myself. I'm giving up hope. If this next round of medication and therapy don't help, I'm done with the life I'm living. I'll save up money and move to the west coast and start a completely fresh life.

I don't know what is going on in my head anymore. I hate my life and I hate myself. I was on top of the world a little over a year ago. Things in my life fell apart emotionally in the last year and I'm lost now. Maybe it is graduating college. Maybe it is growing up. I don't know.

I'm posting this to vent my frustrations. I have so much more to say, but I don't think anyone will see this, nor respond. If you've gotten this far, please say something. Tell me if you've felt the way I feel. Everything is going well in my life, but I still hate myself and my life. Just tell me I'm not crazy.

Thank you,

1. I AM LOOKING FOR ADVICE ON HOW TO HELP HIM. I do not want to be told to leave him.  I am a domestic violence survivor and I know what is a problem relationship. This hasn’t reached that level.

2. I don’t want to hear about how he is cheating, or anything else. I know the man, I trust him. I’m concerned about his health.

I think my partner has bipolar depression. We’ve been together close to a year and his mood seem to go in cycles of four months.

Month 1: Happy go lucky, super fun. We party every week, out til 4 or 5 drinking on work nights and then he gets up at 730 for work. Overeating, over drinking, compulsive travel and adventures, risky behavior like public sex. I’m not going to lie, it’s a huge amount of fun.

Month 2: More normal, quiet dinners together, more intimate settings, less drinking late, he wants to go to bed earlier, more focused, more constructive, less scattered thoughts. This is my favorite part.

Month 3: Starting to withdraw. Sort of being more quiet, texts become less frequent. We still meet a few times a week. This is when he may use drugs, specifically ones that “pick you up.”

Month 4: total shutdown, 3-4 weeks of total withdrawal and shutdown. During this time he may run away for 2 weeks for travel but has a miserable time. May or may not communicate during this time. Possible suicide attempts, one time he climbed out of the 5th floor of his apartment building and his mother talking him down. This month ends with him getting back in touch like nothing happened and we start over at the top.

I’ve also noticed we get “month 4” behavior if we run into normal life stress, like death in his family or a move but it may only be a few days.

Of course this isn’t fixed so but these are general trends. 

He was on Zoloft for 6 months in high school and was taken off it because it made him completely manic and uncontrollable. He’s also got severe anxiety and zero self esteem.

He is also one of the most kind, considerate and loving men I’ve ever met, and I want to be with him, good and bad. I just want to make sure he’s getting the help he needs.

My question is: how can I help him get help? I’ve suggested therapy but he isn’t ready. I think he needs to talk to a psychiatrist. Right now we are on the 4th round of “month 4” and he’s been off the grid for 3 weeks. When he gets back to me in a few weeks, I want to try to get him to make an appointment. Any thoughts.",18Oct2019,7
100,"Just a thing I wrote and secretly wished everyone at my school and in my family read even though it’s me being a brat

I am not okay when you are waving at your friend across the classroom. I can see it in the corner of my eye. You distracting the teacher impacts me. Not everyone is smart or doesn’t care about school. I will hate you. You laughing next to me makes me startled. No, I don’t understand. I need you to help me understand your joke or math problem. I can’t tell if you are teasing or being intentionally mean to me. Poor jokes are not my fault for misunderstanding. Please make the movie theatre quieter and put on subtitles. I can’t hear you. Repeating yourself four times just so I can hear your cool news or topic will make me smile. Not willing to repeat yourself gives me the impression that I am even more disabled. Tell me when I am being rude and why. I try my best to express my emotions. I may smile too much or have a flat expression. Don’t call me dramatic when you suddenly turn on the blender or my flat feet are in pain. I notice when you don’t care about what I am saying. I also notice when you are happy for me. My webbed and fused neck always feels tense or in pain, so don’t be angry at me when I have meltdown if you keep forcing me to walk or stand. My head banging, throwing objects, and sobbing should indicate I want to be left alone. If my head is buried in my knees, I am rocking, and nonverbal, I am experiencing an intense shutdown and need to be somewhere quiet and dark and read an anatomy book or pet my dog. Don’t force me to take off my headphones to talk to you after school. I am trying to decompress from all of the stimuli I went through. I am fragile despite looking very stubborn and confident on the outside. Handle me carefully with personal topics.",18Oct2019,1
101,"Last year, I met this guy and I fell for him fast. Early into our relationship, he was diagnosed with schizophrenia and went on anti-psychotics. I’ve struggled with depression for a long time so I wasn’t judgmental at all or scared. I researched everything I could about his illness and I asked my therapist to explain to me about it too. I was as supportive as I could possibly be and I always told him that it doesn’t change how I feel about him and that I know his brain is sick. He told me all about his hallucinations and opened up to me. He said I’m only one of 3 people he’s ever told. 

When he went back to college after winter break, he sort of freaked out on me. He kept sending texts saying things like “I can’t be there for you.” He ended up dumping me and blocking me on everything and I didn’t get an explanation for why. A few months later I was unblocked and we talked. Then he blocked me again. 

I really love this guy and I always want to be here for him, relationship or not. The last time I talked to him, I didn’t even recognize him anymore. He doesn’t sound or act like the guy I once loved. 

Can you please give me some advice? He’s the first person I’ve ever known with schizophrenia (to my knowledge) and I don’t know what behavior is typical. I want to know what I can do better and what to expect",18Oct2019,2
102,"Strangely direct I suppose but I just wanted it to be clear before I dove in.

I was in a relationship with someone long distance for almost three years until about two weeks ago when they ended it. In this time, we were never particularly close sexually given the distance just made doing things on Skype or whatever reasonably limited, so I gravitated towards a different activity we did together as something I considered the most important thing. About five months ago now, they stopped doing that activity with me, opting to do it with someone else instead. I was distraught and it ate me up and caused my anxiety and mental health to plummet to the point I considered suicide. At one point during this, I equated it to cheating on me - the act of taking something I considered intimate and important and giving it to someone else. They flipped at me, threatened me with breakup unless I took it back on the spot. Told me it was an awful thing to say.

I don't believe it was though. I enjoyed the sexual stuff we did manage, but it was never a driving force. I'd have given up all sexual contact entirely if it meant we kept our hobby going together. But they just refused to believe they could be the one in the wrong, up until the day we broke up.

It's eaten at me every since, and I'd love to know if I'm thinking too much into it or not. I'm not here to be told I'm right and the like unless I am, so please just be clear and honest with me.",18Oct2019,3

Hi everyone (F21). i live with my mom and am currently taking a break from college (i restart next september). my older sister used to bully me a lot and i had a lot of problems because of that (depression, ed, self harm, suicidal tendencies) from 11 to 18 (and still deal with them today but not as much). when i was 18 my mom kicked her out after being awful to us for so long; it was a very traumatic experience, the police were called, family came over, neighbours were watching... 
eventually we moved away and so did she, she travelled with her boyfriend and worked here and there for a few years. she apologised to me and i (thought i) forgave her which wasn’t bad since we were away from each other. she has been spending time here at home after being in debt and at first it was for two weeks, then turned into three weeks and now my mom tells me she’s moving back in for a while, she even found a job in town.

113,"Agoraphobia, depression, 16+ hours a day online.

That was me a year and a half a go, and that is me at this moment. I have been like that since the beginning of this month.

&amp;#x200B;

I was doing really really fine. Life got a lot better and I have made a lot of progress with exposure therapy. After years of being housebound I was able to take public transports, eat out, go to the cinema....

Basically, I got the point when I did not give a fuck whether I have panic attack or not, because I knew from experience that it won't hurt me. I still had ""NO GO"" places, but in general I was doing really great.

That was not the only change I did. Stopped playing games, watching porn and masturbating, and even stopped using internet for nearly half a year..  
I was doing really good until my grandpa died. That happened 5 months ago. Overwhelmed by people coming every single day and the fact that I have gradually stopped going for my daily exposure my fear of panic attack gradually, but surely returned.

Until I had a big one and that the worst thing possible, escaped.

From that point onward, I did my exposure less and less. I mean, it was not so bad, but my depression simply took over. I couldn't get the thoughts of my head, such as: 

""This is pointless, and why I am even doing this?""

""I've been doing this for a year and a half and I am still here.""

Sure, I've been practicing CBT and I am meditating daily for 4 years, so I was able to spot those thoughts and simply to not believe in them. But...I got the point were it didn't make much sense to LIE to myself anymore. Facts are facts. Sure, those thoughts were not ""useful and helpful"" but they were still the facts.

Even thought I did my best with exposure, at one point I simply gave up....and here I am.

Browsing the internet, watching porn, and playing games for the past 2 weeks. I am trying to get back on the track, because internet, porn and gaming actually makes me feel even WORSE. But it is so damn hard.

The main issue right now is the damn depression. Depression because I cannot live the life that I want. I am 33, I never had any job and I am living so far away from my values and I wonder will it ever get better?

My teeth are in terrible shape and that has been the biggest source of my depression and insecurity. But, I can' really do much about it.

Another thing is that I absolutely hate spending time online, playing games and watching porn. That is so fucking away from my values...

I mean, the life that I actually want to live and that will enjoy for sure is not spent at home. It is living freely and enjoying every moment of it. But, I am not even close to that, and in order to get there, it will take me a LOT of effort. And frankly, I am not sure if it is ever going to get better despite my best effort.

114,"Hello!  
I have been dealing with depression for the past seven years or so. Starting from a young age, I was diagnosed with it but never took any medication and jumped from one therapist to another. Once I graduated high school, I decided to leave for university in a different country and had to deal with my depression on my own for the first time. During that time, I got deep into philosophy and constantly read authors that didn't necessarily help with my feelings of despair, but made me feel understood and that I had somehow reached some type of awakening—one that required looking deep into the void and accepting it as a part of the meaninglessness of existence. Whilst in therapy, I refused to take antidepressants even though I was constantly having suicidal ideations further promoted by the philosophical currents I adhered to.   


After finishing university, I returned to my home country and went from a constant, somewhat bearable depression to utter madness. There was not a single day I didn't think of killing myself and became exasperated at the ""problem"" of not having the means to do so. I actively looked for ways to die and worsened my drug consumption. Being with my family again, it was no longer possible to hide my symptoms and I agreed to visit a psychiatrist. I was first given sertraline but, after having a mood peak, I was prescribed mood stabilisers in case I was bipolar. I switched doctors after a while and am currently taking fluoxetine and an antipsychotic to keep suicidal ideations and derealisation episodes at bay. I've been in a great mood lately; however, there is this constant thought that I'm living a lie and that I'm sedating myself because I couldn't endure what I once deemed a conscious awakening to the true nature of life and being (and, to some extent, still do). Now I'm thinking whether taking my meds is really a good choice or if I'm rather taking some kind of soma to forget about the lack of intrinsic meaning and forcing myself into a productive member of society that cannot act upon her notions of self.  


Have you had a similar experience? I don't want to quit my meds, but this thought is haunting me every second of the day.",18Oct2019,0
115,"I just recently admitted openly to seeking help for depression and anxiety. I start seeing a therapist and I was pleased with the experience. Then the medical bills hit my already thin bank account. Let's just say it wasn't a pleasant day. So basically I have a high deductible medical ins that won't cover anything until deductible is met. So I'm a bit overwhelmed with the idea of now having to budget mental health as if it should be compared to my cable or cell phone bill. I know in the end you can't put a $$$ amount on your well being, but give me a break; the private medical industry and health insurance companies sure as hell can. Anyways, I didn't mean to rant. I just wanted to ask how everyone is paying for therapy, if at all.",18Oct2019,3
116,"Reddit I'm lost and I don't know what to do because I don't have experience dealing with this and I really don't want to do anything to make him feel worse or ruin what we have. 

I'm seeing a guy who I very much like and he has depression, like pretty badly it seems. When he's depressed he just shuts down and shuts me and everyone out. And he seems to be going through a depressive episode at the moment. Like for the past few weeks, and this week has been especially shitty with work. I've never been with someone who does something like tell their partner to leave them alone and not talk to them for like a whole day and/or night so naturally when it first happened we ended up arguing quite a bit before he eventually kind of opened up to me about it. 

I've been trying to be understanding and not push for him to be a bit more willing to talk it out, or not just shut me out like he does, but it's hard. Because it makes me feel so awful. To an extent I feel like I can appreciate the intensity of depression but in all honesty I don't. Growing up my parents were never much for getting that kind of thing diagnosed in me or either of siblings, nor were they particularly emotionally supportive or available. And it's not like any of us are the picture of good mental health either.. so it's hard. And not anything I've dealt with before or been shown/explained ways in which to handle so I don't know what to do. 

Experiencing it first hand has kind of shocked me and left me feeling lost. Because I really care about this guy and I want to make it work. But I just don't know how to best handle when he gets like this. It's not like he'll talk to me and tell me how best to handle it. I've had a shitty few years and am in therapy myself so honestly when he's being like this and being cold and harsh towards me for no reason I'm struggling to handle this properly, and not let my own head get to me. Telling me that he doesn't care about me because otherwise he wouldn't treat me like this. I try and tell myself that he isn't trying to hurt me and this is just how he is but it's extremely difficult to stop my anxious brain from going into overdrive in these situations. 

He just wants to be left alone and I'm learning to respect that better every time, but it doesn't seem to get any easier for me to do and that's becoming kind of emotionally exhausting to me. 

I don't know what to do. Please can someone try and get me to see a bit clearer. I know that making it about me is not good, or fair and won't resolve anything; I need to be able to give him what he wants without letting it get me down so much, can anyone who's been through similar maybe give me some advice?",18Oct2019,16

Now it's Friday and I havent heard anything so I'm starting to lose hope. I've been in a horrible slump for days where I barely eat or get off the couch. 

It's even worse that I have to go to work today, Sunday and Tuesday. Because now I've lost that hope where its like ""today sucks but it might be one of my last!"" Because now it probably wont be for a long while. 

This job, despite how simple and easy and non stressful it would be to everybody else, has had such an impact on me. I hate how my mom (who I live with- I'm 20 and in university) prioritizes me having a job over my mental health. Like she sees me sobbing every time I have to go in, consoles me in the freezer at work, and sat by while I had a breakdown a few weeks back and started self harming. She sees all this and still thinks I shouldnt quit until I find another job.

I became suspicious of him (because I think he's out to get me for whatever reason, sometimes because I think I may have said something and that might have made him upset.) So anyways, when he came over (I became suspicious that he might try to steal something from my room when I'm asleep). So I set a precautionary measure; I closed my door and I put my laundry basket behind it and I would take a picture of exactly how I put it.

i’m really concerned i have schizophrenia, and/or some other illness’ such as avoidant personality disorder.

i would like to mention i have done a lot of researching and have been sort of documenting myself the past few months.

from around the age of 7-8 my mum would verbally and emotionally abuse me, everyday and i believe that could be a cause of this, thankfully i only live with my dad now.

i really want to get diagnosed since it could become more severe over time, however knowing my dad he wouldn’t believe me and just say i’m growing up, it’s all in my head. my dad is so kind and nice, but when it comes to mental things there’s always an excuse it’s me growing up, he just won’t take me seriously.

also i act very different depending on my surroundings and who i’m with, it’s like 5 different lives, with my dad, by myself, at school, online and with my mum and other siblings. because of this he doesn’t know what i’m like alone and at school, so he doesn’t have a clue what i get up to, the closest thing he knows to how i act at school is how violent i can be. (violent as in punching, kicking, tackling not proper full on fights, however i’m only violent towards others if i know i’m not going to completely knock them out and they are somewhat ok with it.)

how should i approach my dad? how do i talk to him about it? how should i convince him?

I'm struggling with identifying who I am and what classifies me, as me. I'm in my 30s and have little to no memories of my childhood and growing up, and the beginning of my adulthood. Nothing traumatic happened to me, but when I think back to memories of my family, growing up, all my ""firsts"" I can maybe remember flashes of moments, but not how I felt, not why I made certain decisions, no sentimental connection to any of it. Aren't all of these moments supposed to be what makes me ""me""?   


Now, i feel mostly empty. I watch a movie or a live show and although I feel like I'm responsive in the moment, the minute it's done, it's gone. I can't think back to it, I have no opinions of it, I have no reaction to what I've seen. To the point that if you asked me about how I liked a show I watched 3 weeks ago, I might not even recall watching it, until I see some visual that will remind me, but still the details are gone.

145,"Hi guys,

I don't know if this is the right place but I'll go ahead and describe my situation.

Let's call my classmate X, we're both 31 years old. We used to be good friends back in the day when we were 15-16, hanging in the same small group, riding bikes and all that growing up stuff... We kinda fell apart when he was held back a grade and we didn't hang out anymore. I went to high school and law school after that and didn't hear much about how he was doing. I had one encounter with him maybe a year or two into uni where we met on the bus and he filled the entire 1,5h bus ride describing his sexual encounters and belittling women. I remember a few other classmates describing a similar encounter with X from that period.

By now I've heard he has also gone ahead and went to law school (a school that doesnt have a good rep and supposedly hands out a degree to pretty much anyone willing to pay tuition. some of my classmates from uni have gone to do their masters there after BA and describe it as ""easy as"". Doesn't matter, i remember him from schooldays for not having the sharpest mind but who knows - maybe he's gotten his stuff together. Good for him.

Now that more than 12 years have passed from our last encounters, X has added me on Facebook. There's no intro or anything, he just starts talking about having some brilliant movie ideas that he has and his plan to succeed in the movie industry, there is a lot of mentions of IQ in most random places (and constantly reminding that his IQ is extremely high) and also bunch of stories of how he used to go out and pick up girls every time he went out. Also there was a (fairly disturbing) description of his method of ""going out alone, joining a random group of strangers and trying to pick up a chick and if they send him away just trying again by trying to join a new group (of strangers)...."".Also, there is a lot of talk about being an existentialist and fan of socrates + a bit of Jordan Clarkson and Sam Harris in between.

I did ask him where is this all coming from and why is he sharing all this with me and he said something like he is following the socratic way and everyone is familiar and also that he is casting people from these conversations to gather a group of smart people for when he has succeded with his plans.

I have a few friends that have had the exact same experience - X has added them after a decade of zero contact and the topics are the same.

I really don't know what to make of it but i am worried about his mental health. At times he seems way more educated than i ever could've imagined him being from back when we used to hang out but still the vibe and the randomness of him popping up with all this detailed data of his supreme plans and ideas is weird.

Seems that he has had like 2-4 bday greetings on his facebook wall during the last years and maybe he just doesn't have much friends? Or could it be something else? What is causing this? How should I act in these one sided conversations? Am i right to be worried?",18Oct2019,0

In conversations, I have a knack for zoning out of conversations if I am with a group of people and recently noticed in general I never feel satisfied or there is a feeling of ingratification when talking to people. To compensate I think I try to intensitise the conversation, examples: talking at a different pace/tone to the conversation, finish other peoples sentences, interrupt people, get frustrated when interrupted or when someone else hogs the conversation space. All this trying to chase that feeling of gratification. I think this feeling is the reward feeling known as Dopamine. My theory is I have a dopamine deficiency, which is basically what ADD is. Basically ADD or not, I probably need to have some sort of dopamine enabler to fix my brain, some kind of stimulant.

150,"Hello   


So really quick, I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 with a possible combination with BPD about 3 ish months ago. I started with 10mgs of Trintellix after my first visit with my nurse practitioner. She directed me to a psychiatrist and after, began taking 25mgs of Lamictal along with the Trin.   
Now, I'm up to 100mgs of Lamictal and I'm feeling pretty great.   
Only problem is that one of my medications (or both) is making me extremely nauseous. I take it in the morning because my nights can wildly vary. Because of this, I've had multiple instances of having to run to the bathroom in the middle of a lecture. Walking back into class looking disheveled with red eyes isn't fun.

So I'm wondering if anyone has experience with taking one med at night and another in the morning. I suspect it's the Trintellix that's causing this and it don't mind being as consistent with it so I'll try taking my dose tonight even though I already took it this morning. 

Thanks and sorry for the long post.",18Oct2019,1
151,"I had an incident in a parking lot. I pulled out of a spot and a pickup truck backed out in front of me. He kept gesturing towards me and I was confused as to why he pulled out in front of me. Eventually I backed back into the spot and rushed out of the parking lot. I didn't realize it but I'd cut off the pickup I'd just encountered while rushing out of the parking lot. He blared his horn and I beeped back. He then pulled up next to me, I could see he was wearing a cop's shirt and he said, ""You were going the wrong way! That was the problem!"" I then just started crying and drove home. I'm a terrible driver, but now I'm afraid he could report it and I could be arrested. I know that pulling out in front of him could be perceived as road rage but I was honestly just upset and rushing to get out. What could happen to me? Could I be charged? Could I got to jail? How long until I'm in the clear and I know I don't have charges against me? What could happen? What should I do? I'm so tired of being so afraid and I don't want to wait around to see what could come of this. I really thought about hurting myself this time. I'm so tired of being afraid and I dont want to go to jail or to have a criminal record.",18Oct2019,2

153,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 3.5 years now. We both met and bonded over the fact we both wanted to go into the same profession. In the beginning of our relationship, we both attempted to get into nursing school (BSCn) and I got in right away and he didn't. I've always been an exceptional academic student so academics were never difficult for me. For him, academics were much harder but he put the work in and on the third attempt, 2.5 years into dating, he got into the program. During the 2.5 years, I helped him immensely, he used me as a crutch and I was okay with it because I enjoyed taking the ""teacher"" role. I helped him upgrade his prerequisites, oftentimes completing assignments for him as he was bad with time management. Once he got into the pram, since it was the same school, I would make my notes and organize them so that I could later pass them on to him to use. I taught him how to do assessments and I motivated him to great extents. I helped him study alongside my own course load but I didn't mind because I wanted to see him succeed. He was into second semester now and just midway. He was coming out of his first clinical rotation in a residential home where he basically had to do care aide things as all nursing students have to do in order to build a foundation. He absolutely hated it, over the 6 weeks of clinical he began to slowly give up, he began to hate the idea of being a nurse and his mental health was crippling. I tried to motivate him saying the clinical rotation he's in doesn't even begin to teach you of what a registered nurse does and that the clinical rotations coming will be much better. But for some reason, he within a week made his mind up that nursing wasn't for him, and that he hated the idea of taking care of patients and felt he couldn't provide the empathy that's required when being a nurse. Now, a couple hours ago, he just withdrew from the program mid semester. I invested so much time and effort into helping him get to this point that my head feels like it's going to fall off. I feel like this is my failure just because I was such a big part of it since the beginning. He's not dropping and doing nothing, from what he says. He wants to find something else for himself. I'm just scared because he sucks at time management, and he will wake up at like 2pm whenever he gets the chance. He got this far and having to start again I feel like he's going to go back into that cycle. I've been crying for the past 3 hours because I for almost 4 years I've been living this dream that one day we'll be nurses together, we'll specialize, open our practice, something like that. I always wanted to be with someone in the health care profession, someone I can relate to, someone that when I come home from work, I'd be able to tell things to that would understand. And maybe being so stuck in that image I messed everything up. Now, I don't know whether I even want to be with him. I'm so exhausted from the last 3.5 years of supporting him and it going to complete waste, I don't know if I can do it again. I love him, I really do, and I don't want to be that partner that leaves when things get hard but the thing is I've been going through that for the past 3.5 years going through the hardest with him. And now I don't know how to even put myself first. He's so sweet, he's been telling me to prioritize my learning and to put myself first but I don't even think I know how to do that anymore when for the past years I've been so used to putting myself second and helping him as much as I can. The thought of just worrying about myself and letting him figure stuff out is so foreign to me and it's putting an incredible strain on my mental health. I have exams next week and I've just been tired and sleeping all the time, when I haven't been panicking and worrying about him. If there's any advice anyone can give me, or any motivation, please share. Thank you for taking the time to read this far, I hope I explained things properly if not, do ask me. Thank you in advance.",18Oct2019,3
154,"I am so overwhelmed. My brother (25) has been suicidal lately. He is constantly in contact with his counselor on the phone, texting, and in person (which is great!) so he is very open about how down he is feeling, but he allowed his counselor to speak with me the other day to explain how he needs to be around people and he thinks about just going on a long drive to the coast and just to not allow him near firearms or to drive off by himself. I work. I’m a full time student. The paranoia and anxiety I have that he will hurt himself when I’m not looking is outrageous. A close friend of my family just had a parent kill themself so the thought of my brother now doing it is causing stress that idk how to handle. What do I even do? I can’t function without worrying about what is going through his mind. Or if he will jump in the car after I go to sleep or to work. My mom is just angry and wants to runaway. I am trying to hide how bad he is from my sister (21) because she also works and is a full time student and she’ll lose it if she finds out her brother is suicidal after we just lost someone.

160,"I’d just like to mention that my hands were freezing the entire time of writing this and I also have SO MUCH to get out that I struggled keeping a single train of thought so please bare with me. 


long story short I’ve been struggling the past few years and it started freshmen year of high school. I’m currently 19 years old and have been out of high school for about a year and a half or so just to help put things into perspective. Throughout freshmen year my mental health really declined and I missed a lot of school which led to more and more problems which eventually led to a failed suicide attempt near the end of the school year (keep in mind I was never bullied or anything like that) Fast forward to next year and I’m a sophomore and it’s October and things were going great than I started to miss more school which led to my parents wanting to put me in a youth shelter to teach me a lesson and I really didn’t wanna do that especially after being in the psych part of my local hospital and all of that freaked me out and one day i got into an argument about that w my parents and things spiraled and led to me locking myself in a room w a handgun. Police showed up and had rifles pointed at me and it was just a shit show. When I first attempted I was super happy to be alive and it helped me appreciate life again and it wasn’t as traumatic for me but something about this second time really screwed me up. I remember being extremely mad at my parents and the police for ruining my attempt at suicide and I remember being furious towards everyone because I felt wronged as I wanted to leave and they took that away from me. I was 15 years old. Ever since that day I haven’t felt the same. It feels like I did die that day..just not physically if that makes any sense, like I just feel like a ghost. I was also being switched from med to med which caused me to feel like a zombie throughout all of this so my mood was never consistent and I lacked stability. Uhh afterwards I ended up missing like half of my sophomore year and I never went to school and I never saw my friends which really made things hard because I became even more distant from everyone. Oh yeah I also forgot to mention that I quit one of the meds I was taking (Effexor, the doc thought I was bipolar for awhile) cold turkey. Uhhh fast forward to junior year and everything went great for me actually, no problems there and I was getting out more and had a pretty cool girlfriend so that wasn’t a problem at all except my attendance. Now it’s senior year and everything is great, I actually had another gf who was also my best friend so she really made everything amazing for awhile. I also got into smoking weed heavily with my friends but I didn’t worry cus I was still socializing and working and going to class so it was all good. Fast forward to February and at this point my girlfriend turned super manipulative / controlling towards me and the relationship was extremely emotionally abusive and one day I just broke down and ended up in the hospital again but was released the same night as they believed I was fine and just super stressed. Time passes and I forget about that shit but things in the relationship are super bad now. I’m basically the glue holding it together and everyday she would start arguments and tear me apart while also cheating on me occasionally. Although this all went on I still stayed with her because I believed she just had her own mental problems and I thought I could help solve them and that things would return back to normal. She absolutely destroyed my sense of self worth and self esteem ectt like as of writing this I’m still recovering from it. I endured so much w her and throughout the end of the relationship I would continuously get severe panic attacks causing me to vomit and hyperventilate and she would intentionally cause me to have them by threatening me or blocking me and unblocking me yanno a bunch of petty ass games and shit. She really got into my head and fucked me up bad. I was doing great but the relationship contributed to my mental decline again. On top of that my only 2 close friends went behind my back and were messing around w my ex a month after our breakup and that really messed me up as well. 

Okay I know all of that was a mess but this has all been compiling inside my mind as I have had no one to vent to in awhile and i figured the added context would help you guys understand me a little more. 

Uhh okay so now let’s talk about 2019. So the beginning of 2019 was rough due to the relationship problems on top of my already persisting mental health problems and on top of that I lost my full time job which was the only thing grounding me to reality and stability. I also took lsd back to back to back to back for a couple weeks In January right after all these bad events unfolded and that did strange things to my head and I just didn’t like it. Keep in mind I’m very educated on lsd and a lot of drugs due to my own curiosity and I preach safe and responsible drug use so that wasn’t a problem. What was a problem was how the repeated trips really screwed with my mindset. I wasn’t in a good point of my life but I still did it anyways cus I figured I could try to figure myself out more as I’ve felt lost since that 2015 event. Uhh okay January was okay but February of 2019 took a worse turn. My ex decided to torment me more and made comments about me being worthless and what not so I tried to slit my wrists and thankfully didn’t succeed nor did I cut deep enough. That led me to being hospitalized for 3 days being put on Zoloft than released. I was on Zoloft up until a week and a half ago as of today. While on Zoloft I felt extremely desensitized and emotionless as I had felt years ago on similar meds. Everything that happened just happened. Nothing made me sad or mad or happy or anything I was just in a consistent apathetic mood, just going through the motions. Well literally 2 days ago me and my sister had a bad fight and i believe being off Zoloft (I ran out and didn’t have insurance at the time and it took awhile to get insurance back and I didn’t have any Zoloft pills left until the hospital sent me home with more) for awhile and my mood was just everywhere. Well that event triggered something and caused me to breakdown freaking out about going to the hospital again so I started freaking out trying to find something to end my life so I wouldn’t go to the hospital.(not sure why but the hospital and police were always a huge trigger for me and still is) i don’t remember the events much as I kinda “blacked out” as you will and I guess I threatened suicide by cop saying that I’d rather die than go to the hospital when my sister called 911, out of pure worry keep in mind. I eventually grabbed my skateboard to ride and cool off but as soon as I stepped outside an officer had his pistol pointed at me and immediately told me to drop and I was cuffed than taken to the hospital and was evaluated and sent home as I was calm after the episode happened. The doctors determined it as being off the Zoloft and the past couple days since have been pretty average. I feel fine but like I guess I’m just kinda spooked. I’m extremely worried about myself and my mental health because I’m worried I’m gonna have another one of those episode things and lose it or something or whatever and lately I haven’t been able to control them where as back than I could. I’d also like to mention that I feel back to myself and I actually enjoy life again after being off Zoloft but like I feel like I should just take it again because I’m scared of what could happen next. Idk what’s wrong with me but if you guys have any LOGICAL suggestions and have an idea as to what you’re talking to than I’d love to hear your input / feedback on all of this. I have nowhere else to turn to tbh. One last thing I’d lack to add is how I’ve been extremely introverted lately and how my anxiety has been ramped up since that toxic relationship. Okay I think I covered most of it. I’m just very worried about my mental stability. Part of me thinks I have ptsd as all the events got triggered by certain things and I would like to add that whenever these events happened I always felt like I was “15 again” not sure how to explain it but I’m just really lost and I’ve been stuck in this mental purgatory where I don’t wanna live but I don’t wanna die.",18Oct2019,4
