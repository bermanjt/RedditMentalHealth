0,"I’ve been having a host of problems for a long time now &amp; could never get any answers for it

At around 18 I had an MRI, had my eyes checked, my vision you name it. It all looked normal.

I was just recently watching a video of a woman explaining how her life is different from suffering a MTBI from a fall in the shower. She was listing her symptoms &amp; all I could think was “holy shit, that’s me.”

At 16 I got on a horse I shouldn’t have, got bucked off, landed head first into some gravel then was promptly ran over. As dazed as I was I proceeded to go chase the horse down. My mom being the person she is, decided I was fine. Looking back now, that’s fucking crazy. I’m sure I had a concussion.

I also am sure this was brought up at various appointments when trying to find a diagnosis to my problems. Nobody seemed to be concerned.

I never knew how falls can cause just severe problems. Especially even mild trauma to the frontal lobe. 

Anyways, having had an MRI that came back normal, how do I go about being taken seriously about this. It’s the only thing that’s made since in almost 8 years.

1,"Hi All,

I'm going to try to be brief. I suffer from anger, depression and anxiety. I'm mostly depressed due to my cynical outlook on life. My anxiety kicks in every single time that I must do something new or challenging, that includes a lot of bad talk to myself. Now every time I'm stressed I get irritable and angry and to be honest I just cannot find a decent balance. All I can see is darkness and emptiness and I don't know what else to do. I'm not even 30, I have a decent job, I live in an apartment that I rent by myself, I live abroad but I still cannot find a reason to keep on going on. 
All my relationships are superficial and I cannot find the strength to.change to a better me. 
Any suggestions?

Apologies english is not my first language and I just had to put this out there.

Thank.you ",06Feb2019,1

Honestly I just need to know that Im not alone in my experience. I’ve been in therapy for anxiety/depression and OCD for about 5 years now. I’ve made strides but there’s still so much I have to improve on.


Im just wondering if anyone has any advice or even just shared experience on self-loathing. I’m angry at myself. I’m angry at myself ALL THE TIME. Sometimes I feel like I’m going to cry because living with myself and my thoughts is just too much. Every mistake I make plays in my head on repeat. Anger is generally not an emotion I’m comfortable with- even when I should be angry with someone, I find it impossible and always wind up redirecting the anger to myself. And then the anger just turns into sadness 


Do you guys feel this? I know that I need to change the way I think. What makes this situation particularly difficult is that I think somewhere subconsciously I won’t change my thought patterns because I think I deserve the anger I give myself

Its gotten to a point where I cant tell what I should really be afraid of and what my OCD is. I can no longer rationalize anything.

I have isolated myself for the last 7 years and I have never felt more disconnected from the world in my life. Unlike depression this feeling of hopeless doesn't come from feeling deep chronic sadness.....its just fear, paranoia, insecurity and guilt.

I believe i'm letting this problem fester.

I feel that I must hurry and help myself in case I lose it again and end up doing something dumb again. Time is drawing nearer.

While, naturally, I tend to be a nervous person, i've been finding that the reasons for my worries have started to become odd and make no sense. I don't realize it at the time. This fear tends to be all consuming. I feel that it explaining everything would take to long . I suppose if someone wants me to elaborate, I will ,but otherwise I won't much. I've made a post a while ago explaining mostly everything. I've held on to these beliefs for a while, albeit to a lesser extent compared to when I first conceived them. It scares me letting them go though, because what if i'm right. They don't make any sense. . . but they make sense, if that makes sense. Sometimes there's just too many coincidences and I get especially distressed and believe in them full-force again. It's not just that generally speaking i've been doing pretty bad. I'm all over the place. I feel like I can't do anything anymore. I can't think.

From the other couple post here are some of my options:

1. Make my own appointment Pros: Will have appointment made. Cons: Parents will probably be very mad at me and ridicule me for doing so. They might not let me. 2. Tell school staff what is happening with me. Pros: Might force me to get evaluation. Cons: Parent's still not very happy with me, have no idea what I would even tell them , might think i'm faking. 3. Commit Myself to Hospital. Pros: . . . Cons: Scared to go, don't think i'm an immediate danger, have cameras in house so parents might catch on, would randomly disappear and that will probably also catch their attention. 4. Wait for me to accidentally hurt myself for the third time. Pros: Might get help? Cons: Don't want to accidentally hurt myself, possible injury, panic attacks, might lose insight and think i'm fine again, might get pinned to couch again, might run around for weeks-months panicking about nonsense.

I've already gained 20-25 pounds within the last few years just by depression alone without any medication.

25,"
So I will start with this. When I was 8 or 9, I had a female doctor molest me. My mother was actually in the room, but could not see what she was doing to me. I was too scared to say anything in the moment. After the appointment I expressed that I was upset and my mom brushed it off as ""a normal exam."" She told me everyone gets their private parts checked out. (I have never heard of any other female getting down there checked out for no reason at such a young age, but I haven't looked into it either) So I pushed my feelings away and told myself it was normal. The same doctor also falsely told us I needed back surgery in front of me and I started sobbing out of fear.
I know now that what that woman did to me was NOT normal. Today I have a pretty bad fear of the doctor, but I can manage a checkup. The huge problem is the gynecologist. I am only 18, so it's not a really big deal yet, but I have a crippling fear of the gyn. Just the thought of it makes me sweat bullets. I tried watching a video of an exam because I thought it may help, but only made it 20 seconds in before nearly puking and then having a full blown panic attack on my bedroom floor. The position they have you in for an exam is the same position I was in when it happened. Even now as I type this I am starting to sweat and my eyes are getting glassy. I fear the gyn more than death.
My boyfriend tells me I will heal with time, but I feel like I only get worse. My fear of the gyn has grown exponentially and I think of that moment way too much. Sometimes I cry alone at work because it bothers me so much and I wish it would stop appearing in my head. I also have developed dermatillomania over the years and don't like being touched. I hate doctors before I even meet them. I don't have money for therapy and I am terrified of telling family. I have no friends to confide in. If anyone has any advice I would love to hear it because I feel so lost.

I would need another 2 years to earn my masters (so essentially I have 4 years and some change left, plus a *ton* of financial aid and student loans to consider) but I really want to finish my degree. I feel that I’ve invested enough already and that I would make a really good counselor, but my past makes me wonder... 

I myself am in counseling and the last time I saw my therapist she suggested that I have expectations that are too high for myself but she didn’t differentiate between whether that meant pursuing my degree or if it was directed toward the way I pursue general things in life. I’m definitely in that category but I don’t know if she was trying to suggest I shouldn’t pursue this degree... I plan on asking her but I wanted to get some feedback from others first.

I've always been a very anxious person, it wasn't before I was 11 years old that I started having panic/anxiety attacks, and would eventually slip into an depression the same year. My mother would then start taking me to a psychiatrist.

The depression (I obviously had no idea what was wrong with me at the time, I just felt immensly sad and cried all the time) would get a little bit better toward the the start of 7th grade, and I eventually started enjoying life... until I turned 14, the anxiety would come back, and I would also be diagnosed with anorexia nervosa. I would just deny that, thinking that males cannot get eating disorders. (Oh boy was I wrong).

I quickly started to lose popularity, and people started to stare at me... my eating disorder twisted me into thinking I was ugly and overweight, so I got even skinnier to the point of almost being hospitalized, which made me hate myself even more.

Then the depression came back, at age 15. I barely went to school anymore, I would often isolate myself, just sitting there and self harm while listening to some questionable music which I believe made my mental state even worse. 

According to people around me (my family, who are very supportive) I used to be this happy and social guy who enjoyed life.

Three years went past, I dropped out of school, while my friends went on to go to something that is about the equivalent of a high school or college in the US (16-18 year olds). They got girlfriends, new friends, etc. Looking back, it feels like I've lost a lot of my teenage years, and it feels bitter as hell...

There's obviously a lot more detail to my story than this, but as I wrote earlier, I'm feeling really low right now.

I'm turning 19 years old this year, but it isn't getting any better. 

I have this devouring feeling of anxiety and depression inside me, almost constantly nowadays. I try to keep my spirits up during the day, but it bites me in the ass when I try to go to sleep at night, because the feelings are too overwhelming.

The worst part is something I've tried to deny myself to believe for some time now, but I am starting to believe that I have some sort of bipolar disorder. 

Just writing this post is difficult, because I change my mind so quickly. Do I have Bipolar Disorder or do I not? 

I'm sorry if my post is disorderly written... I also just switched over to a new psychiatrist, and I don't really like her...

I've been close to commiting suicide before, and I've been to one of those emergency hospitalization centres.

But do I really want to do it? These past 2-3 weeks have been particularily difficult for some reason... 

I really hope I get back on track to a normal life, how life was before I got mentally ill, to get a job and maybe even a girlfriend, but my fluctuating emotions can be really rough, and it's been two days since I last slept...

I don’t necessarily think I’m a bad person, I don’t know why I feel this way. I’m a nice person but I feel guilty all the time for everything I do.

For example my mom was congratulating me on doing good in school and I thanked her and stuff but I also brought up that some people weren’t doing so good, specifically the girl who sits next to me. And for some reason I feel really guilty now. I was just trying to talk about how hard the class was but I feel like I was talking bad about this girl now, and my mom was so proud of me but now I feel like she shouldn’t be proud of me because I’m a mean person(because I said that this girl wasn’t doing good). Another thing is that today my boyfriend took me out for coffee and I didn’t want coffee so I ordered juice instead and I just felt really guilty about it for some reason. Like I ruined our date.

I know that’s a stupid example but it’s how I feel right now, and pretty much all the time. Every little thing I do I feel guilty over. Obviously ordering juice instead of coffee doesn’t make me a bad person but for some reason even little things like that make me feel so guilty and like I don’t deserve the people around me that love me.

33,"This is all started when I was a kid, I would see videos about the military and since then I always dreamed of joining the US army and at least serving 4 years. My parents always just saw that as a child's dream. My father especially would punish me and become enraged if I did the smallest mistake in school. I remember once when I didn't understand a question, get started yelling and calling me a stupid idiot and why did I ask him for help if I couldn't even understand it. So I stopped asking them for help with my assignments. When I turned around 8 we moved to another town and I was bullied for years and never told my parents because I didn't want their help. That mindset of them just going to be yelling and blaming me for the mistakes just stuck with me even to this day. My dad is also a strict catholic and would force me and my younger siblings to catholic school on weekends to be good Catholics. But around age 13 I began to see things that I was against the church and it began a split between my family and me. Then when my uncle began to argue with my mom and her side of the family and me and my siblings, instead of defending us and calling him off, he told us that we are to shut up and respect his brother. I began to hate my dad and my mom would tell me shit about his side, but when I would stand up to him she and my father would talk me down. I was the only one who was willing to defend against them as my siblings were too young to do so themselves. And this wasn't just in the family, if I got in trouble even if I was in the right, my father always found a way to blame it on me. Even if I was in an accident or an event of any kind , he would blame it on me for not being careful or being stupid enough to do it. When I started high school, I started to become independent, and taking control of my own future, but when it came time to make large decisions like which classes to pick, my parents wold choose everything for me. When I wanted to join NJROTC in my freshmen year, they just told me ""Are you stupid, you want to join the army and die out there."" I told them ""You know I wanted to join since I was a kid."" They just signed me up for sports. It was to the point where I couldn't decide my own meals for them to cook without them changing it in some way or complaining about it. Eventually I did join ROTC and they thought it would get me out of the ""military phase"". But even through those years they never supported me fully, they just showed up at major inspections and cheered and they would constantly ask if I was still joining and I just ignored them. In NJROTC we have to go to a dance called the military ball. And I wanted to go alone, but no ""We picked a date for you, you are going with her so you wont be alone and miserable."" I didn't know this girl and she only came so she can say she went to all her friends. I told them off when it was done and they still always bugged me about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

When they started to realize I didn't want to go to college at all until after the military they started to pressure me telling me ""oh you want us to suffer, you don't love us, we did everything for you"" kinda bullshit. So I just lied to shut them up. When they found out I was talking to a recruiter that's when it kicked me in the heart. They were angriest then they have ever been before in my life at me. All the shit they did too me for years about my dream they just kicked me mentally in the groin until I submitted and said Ill go to college. Even as I was depressed over the months following the event, no one noticed, no one cared, I just hid it and pretended everything was fine. Until one day after shooting practice, when everyone was gone, I stole a rifle and 1 round. I placed the barrel in my mouth, 3...2...1 (click). Before I could pull that trigger, something flashed in front me. It was realization. I just realized what I was doing, ""no"". Is all I said before i put the rifle away pretending like nothing happened. And still no one noticed me suffering in my head. First being rejected by three girls I was deeply in loved with, to having controlling manipulative parents, to being bullied for years, to thinking of everyone around me hating me. That all almost pushed me to end it all. That flash made me think of what would happen if I did that, god would reject me. 

&amp;#x200B;

So 2 months pass by and its the first week of December. Christmas vacation is around the corner and I am trying to enjoy my day. As chief and major and the other high ranking students set up decorations. I start a conversation with my commander a 19 year old named Eric. He treated his men including me well. I then begin to have memories flashbacks and possibly ptsd from that day. I then tell Commander Eric, ""CO can I talk to you in private, I need to clear my head"". We discussed everything, I cried kicking my chair break, regretting what I almost did. Why I almost did it, and what triggered that moment. He comforts me tells me everything will be fine. Next period my other friends see me and ask if I am alright. 2 hours later I get called into the counselors office and they tell me that my commander had told them. I had to tell them what happened. My parents would out. My mom was crying and balling her eyes, my dad was furious at me and blaming telling me that I was stupid for not telling them about this. Why did you think that. etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wasn't allowed to return to school until a week later when I was approved to leave the hospital. Even after explaining, my dad still fought with me to be a catholic and both still forced me to quit any plans to join the military. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today I am 18 now, it was over a year ago that happened and I am in college but I miles away from them. I honestly regret ever going to college even thought they are paying for it all. Its not the life path I wanted. Really the only bright side is that I can at least be on my own away from them and I could do almost what I want within my zone. I also still plan on going to the military and joining the French Foreign legion after the US army. But I still have nightmares of that day, of my depression. I still get headaches of the flashbacks to those years. 

&amp;#x200B;

They still control my life although now that I am miles from them its not as strong of a grip, but they still bring up me ""choosing to go to college"" and that they are paying for it. They are completely against me getting a job or even going to study abroad alone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I still am optimistic that one day I will be able to just live my life without any of their control in it. 

&amp;#x200B;

If there is one thing I can say to anyone else going through what did just say ""You had your lives to live out, now its my turn.""

34,"Hi redditeers! My partner has always struggled with mental health issues, however the last couple of years have been hard. 
We have 3 amazing children together and she has started to fray really badly. 
Unfortunately for me when she gets overwhelmed she takes it out on me. It’s only verbal but I’ve started to become over sensitive and my nerves are shot (seriously she broke the lid of a toy box last night and my heart tried to escape my chest. I should add this was a accident she walked over the lid when it was on the floor). 
Now I am starting to pre empty her anger by getting angry myself at the slightest provocation or hint that I did something wrong. I shrugged and made a face the other day and it turned into an hour long argument!
I don’t know what to do any more! She is trying to get help but I don’t know if it’s enough. How can I say something upset me if I’ll only get excuses of “I’m sick, you don’t understand it’s not my fault!”.
I’m so stressed right now and don’t know what to do anymore. I’m not feeling compassionate anymore, just angry and it’s not like me. I’m normally a very empathetic and understanding person but it’s killing me!

39,"hi recently i’ve been noticing that i’ve developed some really weird habits where i doubt my own sanity and check things over and over again 

examples:
on instagram i get irrationally nervous that i accidentally somehow commented something bad on someone’s post even when i KNOW i haven’t typed anything. then i go and count all the comments on the post (even if there’s like 30) to make sure i didn’t somehow secretly leave a comment

before bed i will check to make sure the oven and lights r off in my kitchen and that nothing is plugged in. i will check like 4 times even if i KNOW that i JUST LOOKED and everything WAS OFF. i will be looking directly  at the turned off oven and think “what if i’m seeing it like this but really it’s on” or i’ll wonder if maybe i turned the oven on while checking it (even tho i didn’t touch it at all)

i will open and close the messages app a million times to make sure i didn’t accidentally text someone something bad/inappropriate even though i know i haven’t. if i don’t check then i get super nervous that i did send something weird that i have no memory of sending

i do a lot of little things like these where i keep doubting my own ability to ..  accurately perceive reality i guess? this has developed within the last 6 months or so. any ideas as to what’s up with me? ",06Feb2019,1

I don’t like talking to anyone about my problems. I had a 40 minute session today and sat silently for 20 of them until my therapist started talk.

42,"Hello.
I'd like to begin through stating that I belive I have a rather healthy mind. I have never visited a therapist of any kind, mostly because if I'm going through an anxious episode, I keep it to my self and don't want anyone to know.
I have had suicidal thoughts for years now, and only have come close to doing so a few times. However, I like to belive that suicide is not on my agenda, it seems far from where I am right now.
I have big planes for my future, and I live dreaming of those. They are my motivation and the source of my will to continue.
Now, if one of these failed, mostly because their outcome are based in soneone else's decision, I found comfort in thinking about suicide.
I have this thought of: if the reason I'm here failed, and if I don't want to be here in the first place, going out seems actually like a charming idea. Almost as a plan B.
I don't think of this dread which is the reason I'm writing this. I'm not scared of disturbed by it, and I want to see if more people find this normal or not.

43,"This is my first post ever, but I just wanted to share my experience and maybe get some advice.

Last fall I started my first semester of college and it was the worst 4 months of my life. By the end of the semester I was run so thin I thought everyday was going to be my last. I wasn't getting more than 5 hours of sleep a night, I was overly stressed about school, I had health problems relating to my GI tract/ heart problems/ lung problems/ etc., and was having problems with family on top of it all. I had already been diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety a few years back and was on meds, so my doctor and I tried tweaking with my meds, but honestly just made it worse.

Come winter break, I was in the worst depressive episode I had ever been in, and it was scary. Everyday I was having extreme suicidal thoughts, but thank god I was too paralyzed with depression to act on them. Each day felt like a year and I was suffering 24/7. I had a periods here and there of no sleep, yet terrible depression. I finally saw a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with unspecified bipolar/ bipolar II (she hasn't decided 100% with all of the factors). She started me on Lamictal and seroquel on top of my 225 mg Effexor I was already taking. The holidays and everything combined caused me to fall into an even deeper depression and the diagnosis was not a relief but more of a life sentence. The spring semester started and I missed every single class the first two weeks, so I decided to withdraw for the entire semester. I feel so disappointed in myself for not being able to just push through it like I did first semester, but I honestly do not think I would be alive by the end of the semester if I tried to do school.

I'm currently taking lamictal, seroquel, and effexor, seeing a therapist, exercising, eating healthy, taking supplements, anything I can, yet it just keeps getting worse. I had a good few days of solid sleep and a stable mood, but last week it all disappeared. All of the sudden I was back to where I was 2 weeks prior. I'm really losing hope on ever getting ""better"" and being able to lead a so-called normal life. My suicidal thoughts are back and every day is a struggle between me and my mental illness. I am tired of suffering and having to live my life like this!

I desperately need to start recovering. If you have anything to offer I am listening!!",06Feb2019,1
44," I know I'm depressed. I have been since I was 11 or so (probably before that).


I'm 19 now, I've never seen or told anyone (except for my best friend).



I'm an absolute wreck of a human. My diet consists of coke, redbull, and junk food. Also a pack of fags a day as well. My personal hygiene is near non-existent, hardly ever shower or brush my teeth. I never do exercise either.



I sleep way to much (I can easily sleep for 18 hours a day, if I could). When I can't, I sleep every moment I can. 



My parents have never mentioned about me or my health. Not once. They just seem to think I'll click out of it or something (talking about this kinda think is really taboo in my family for some reason). 




I've spent many hours on the Internet trying to research this  before. Everything I've come to is more to do with fear or not knowing how to get help, not about not wanting help.

45,"hey guys. I’m new to reddit. well I just started an account. I use to just browse through threads. but I wanted to ask for advice... I’ve been dealing with anxiety/pure o ocd for around 5 years (I’m 20). It’s been a hell of a journey. I say that because I’ve been dealing with it on my own, not purposely thought. when my anxiety started I told my mom and she would dismiss me as if I was bothering her. so that made my anxiety worse... I felt alone, nobody in my family had it, they didn’t understand... but I managed to deal with it... I would even talk to teachers, but that only lasted for a while... after I got out of high school everything went downhill from there. I started to get really bad intrusive thought with pure o ocd. they consumed my life. but I still kept it pushing, with hopes that it’ll go on its own. my parents have never been there for me emotionally. recently my brother got depression because of his ex girlfriend and other things he did that made him get depressed. that was enough for my mom to believe him... she would be there for him, console him, give him advice... he even ended up going to therapy for his depression... of course that made me lose hope and made me sad seeing her completely ignore me because “I had no reason to have anxiety”. I don’t mention my dad because I have no relationship with him... all he does is work... I’ve never had a real conversation with him. anyway, all this made me realize that my parents don’t love me... they never have... it’s not only because they didn’t take me to get help. but many other things... when I was in high school me and my dad would always argue and my mom would “defend” me, only to throw it in my face later on. It hurts me because I grew up thinking all this was normal... I want to move out so bad, but I’m scared to not make it on my own... I don’t know how to drive, I don’t have a real job... I don’t have any other relatives or friends... anxiety/pure o has ruined my life... I’m sorry I went in depth, I’m just scared that my mental health with the mental abuse from my parents have completely ruined me from even recovering. I feel stuck... but at the same time I don’t want to make it a big deal... all I want is to be happy and live a healthy life... any advice?",06Feb2019,1

It's 6 am now and I can't sleep. I was sleeping for an hour or so and then I began to think about my life and boom my night is ruined. I can't understand this phenomenon. Why I'm thinking in my sleep?
I overthink a lot when I'm sleeping and it result as me woke and crying a lot and no sleep at all.

A short story here of ""why I'm sad?"".
I can't find peace. Every day is a new day when I say tomorrow is gonna be better but today I started to lost hopes. After 5 years living in the capital next to my uni, I've to move back to my parent house. I was living in a shit hole and paying a lot so my mom suggested I could go back home. At first I thought it was a good idea until I've done that. Now I'm home, in my bed, crying. I don't understand why I'm like this. Before moving out and when I was planning I was happy, I thought I will retrieve myself here, save some money and have a better health (the flat where I was living was pretty bad and affecting my health). Now that I'm here (so after all the work), I'm very sad. I'm not gonna see my boyfriend like before (he can't see me here often and we were used to see each other every day or two), I'm gonna miss my liberty, I'm very anxious that my mom and dad will start dictating my way of life. All of this scare the shit out of me. And it's nearly 7 AM. I've no sleep and I'm crying in my bed. When I was alone I hade problems and I said that moving out will be the best for me. Now that I'm here I can't understand why I've chosen this. Today my sister and my dad said that they didn't understand my decision and I didn't have to go back home. It was just my mom decision... I can't go back to the city, I've nowhere to go, not enough money to have something decent and I just moved out today, I can't go back now...

52,"Using a throwaway for obvious reasons. Just looking to rant realistically and get some shit off my chest. I'm depressed and lost and don't know where to go anymore. I'm married, been married for over 10 years. I care for my wife but don't love and respect her. She got pregnant early in our relationship during the honeymoon period and we just fell into that stage of pregnancy and living together as parents and marriage made sense. But we're not a match, sexually we're quite different as well as personality wise. She's fun and goofy and I'm morose and severe. Most say opposites attract but we're so different the only thing we actually have in common is we're the same age. So I did what any piece of shit does, I cheated and just carried on. Every time the guilt or unhappiness got too much, I'd blow up and try to vocalize how I felt and every time I found myself still fucking married to this poor woman. Now here I am, more than 10 years later, with a job I dislike that pays the bills with benefits for my family. A wife that's severely overweight and doesn't work outside the home. 2 young girls I love and am trying to figure out how to be an involved father to. I got really depressed last year and went to therapy when the suicidal thoughts got to be too much. It helped for a while and, while I didn't confess to my wife, I did tell her it's over. 10 minutes later we're back together and trying to work on our marriage. She guilted me instantly and I just went along with it. Why? Because she had 10 years of no fucking work, no savings or anything. So instead of breaking up my family and leaving my wife destitute I stayed and decided I'll give it time and see how it goes. A few weeks later my job moved me basically across the country with my family in tow. My mental health and marriage went to the back burner. Then we got a damn puppy because I'm fucking weak willed, guilty and dumb. So my overweight wife that was supposed to be going back to work and exercising instead is devoted to this dog and can't obviously leave him alone. We still haven't worked on our marriage realistically or my own mental health because I'm stuck in the work routine. I lost 30 pounds over the last year and feeling physically better and a little more attractive but of course now she's worried I'll just leave her. Which is an understandable worry as I've already tried to leave her once.  I want to be happy but feel trapped. I'm thinking again of just hopping off a bridge or drive into the ocean which I know is wrong but I just feel trapped. I can stay with my marriage which is a lie or leave my wife with no home, no savings, job or even family here. If I leave her I have to stay in my job which I hate because I'll have to pay to support her. If I stay with her I still have to stay in this job to pay the bills.  I just don't know where to go and am stuck in a holding pattern.

My best friend’s older brother has always been introverted and socially different. It was never really a problem throughout high school until he got to college and had a psychotic break (on hallucinogens) and was Baker Acted (taken against his will to a mental institution). 

At the institution, he was diagnosed with Schizophrenia. His mother brushed it off as a side effect of the drugs he took and didn’t seek any further treatment.

Now 5 years later, he’s been coping with instability and delusions via alcohol abuse. There’s been times where he’s gone missing or injured himself from falling while drunk. He started hanging out with homeless people. During the holidays, he was supposed to drive my friend to their family home, and he instead got black out wasted. My friend ended up driving and the brother was upset the entire time about seeing family.

During the holidays, her mother complained that it would be too expensive to put him in therapy or rehab. Her dad offered to bring him back to Florida to seek help. Nothing came from the conversations.

Today, she asked me what to do. He’s apparently having a mental break and not speaking coherently. He’s been on a series of benders, disappearing and what not.

60,Hi. I am struggling at the moment. I have been diagnosed with Aspergers last year. I constantly feel like I'm being divinely persecuted. I feel that the powers that be are amused and laughing and enjoying all the things that go wrong in my life and actively making them happen. Like for instance for Christmas I asked my sister to get me an MP3 player. Her husband bought one from Amazon and I was looking forward to it. Then I unwrapped it and I left it for a while as I was busy but always in my mind I was thinking 'what if it doesn't work' and then I said to myself 'no it will be fine'. Anyways I finally got round to trying it a couple of weeks ago and it didn't work. I feel like the powers that be knew my fears and made it happen. I feel like they always know and are always working towards making things go wrong for me. So now I have to pay money to send this MP3 player back to the manufacturers. They say I'm eligible for refund on their website for return postage but I just know they won't bother refunding me. I'm so tired of things like this happening. Last week I was hot and not thinking properly and the dog was annoying me and I went swimming with my car keys in my pocket and now they are dead so I have to get them fixed too. I feel like my life just revolves around things like this that make me angry and sad. That I'm too busy fixing things that have gone wrong to actually get anywhere.

63,"Hi all,

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety as a young teen, which changed to bipolar I as an older teen (would have been bipolar II except for  two “suicide attempts”). 

I have been on all sorts of medication for it and none of it ever really worked that well. I never really connected with my diagnosis either. I definitely have anxiety, depression, can see a bit of BPD in me as well, potentially. I’m no psychiatrist though so I won’t self diagnose that. 

Was wondering if any of you choose to live without medication? I’ve been off my meds (my choice, tapered them very very slowly myself) since the beginning of December, so two months now. I have honestly not felt this good in years. 

What I have come to realize, is that I think my main issues concern self/emotional regulation and self esteem. Ever since I was a little kid, I was highly emotional and highly sensitive, and very perfectionist. I was volatile and angry and easily hurt/upset. I also dramatically lashed out for attention, a trend which continued until pretty recently (I’m 23). As a teen/young adult this would involve screaming, crying, yelling, breaking things, running away, drinking heavily, and (only twice) suicide attempts. I never actually wanted to die. I was just so desperate for attention that I would do anything to get it. I always was such a perfectionist, and hated myself so much, didn’t have a shred of self esteem. I sought validation and attention from everyone else since I only ever thought negative things about myself in my head.

Once I realized all of this a few months ago, I’ve been trying to just chill out and let shit go. And holy shit but it has really worked. I think growing up and maturing has helped a lot as well. I’ve learned to recognize my emotions, am getting pretty good at regulating myself, etc. When I feel depressed/anxious/think “stinky” thoughts, I refer to these moments and thoughts as the evil voice in my head / my evil alter ego. I know it sounds nuts, and I don’t actually believe that I have an evil alter ego, I just find it helpful to separate that voice from myself because then it’s so much easier to tell myself that all the negative shit I think about myself isn’t true. Now whenever I think some shit, I just kinda screw my face up (weird I know), let it relax, acknowledge that the thought is there but go “You are not true and I don’t need to listen to you. So you’re going to go away now and I’m going to think about something else.” and I do. I force myself to think about useful things that aren’t some bullshit overthinking nonsense that do me no good. And sometimes it takes a few tries, but it works. 

Has anyone else had an experience like this??? Maturing, growing, and learning how to regulate my emotions and thoughts have worked wonders for me. I obviously did a lot of therapy and stuff to be able to achieve this, but yeah. Not saying I’m doing perfect, just that I think it’s interesting that I feel way better off meds than on. I really don’t think I’m bipolar. I just think I have extreme self/emotional regulation and self esteem issues, with an extremely volatile and sensitive and perfectionistic personality, and some anxiety/depression issues that surface at times. So many of my problems over the years really boil down to self hatred and to extreme attention seeking. Does anyone relate to this??? 

Sorry if none of this makes any sense. Would really appreciate any comments/questions.

My illnesses make me think things are going to be way worse than they really are, for example when im about to get up in the AM, it’s a 50/50 chance of whether I’ll actually get up or not because my brain makes me feel like I’ll habe that early morning zombie feeling all day, when in reality it only lasts until i get in the shower and wake myself up. Or I think sleep is more important and it’s okay to miss “just one day”, but it’s not just one day. It’s multiple days a week. I’m doing ok in my classes since most of them are project based, but im really behind in placement hours because I keep missing it. 

I’ve been fired from a job because I was so depressed and always called in “sick” to just stay in bed and wallow. Although I got another one, I hate it. My boss is very rude and yells at me a lot for stupid reasons, so it makes me extremely anxious and I literally shake when I walk in the door. 

My anxiety makes it nearly impossible to do anything without overthinking the crap out of it, and because I overthink it, I end up just saying screw it and saving myself the panic attack and not going or doing the thing im thinking about.

86,"I have been an enthusiastic and active producer of content on the Internet. For years, I used to run a music blog where I spent a few hours a day writing posts. The blog gained some interest by my blogging platform and put on the spotlight. That was simply my favorite moment of online experience. I am still active on social media especially Twitter. I write articles on the topics I have more knowledge about. And yet I am reaching a point where I might just pull the plug off it all and become an Internet hermit. It's thanks to communities like Reddit that I can share my anxiety because I haven't voiced my concerns just yet.

My problem is quite simple and I know I am one of many millions: The amount of engagement and interest I get from my real-life friends online is next to zero. Embarrassed how we come to measure our mental health these days based on social media reactions but it's the truth. Apart from occasional likes now and then, these otherwise friendly people have been silent observers of almost everything I do. Only a few nights back I curated an elaborate list of good music and documentaries I have seen as of late and shared it to a group of close friends on Snapchat. The text was marked as ""seen by everyone"" with absolutely no reaction. This is just one example. 

This feeling of screaming out into the void, spending an awful lot of time on trying to communicate online and start a discussion has exhausted me. I have grown chronic anger against these people. Any moment from now, I may just compose one last post to part ways with them even though I know this will not solve anything.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, in most cases, if the people in your immediate network do not react to or share your posts, it is unlikely that any of your contents will get a good reach. And so has my online experience been for the last couple of years. I do not post selfies. I do not Instagram my wine glasses and lunch dishes. I really do research my work. But at the end of the day, nothing comes out of them.

I am seeking help because I cannot take this anymore. Soon I may lose all my friends based on this issue that is disturbing my focus both at home and at work. Who are these silent observers? In this new media age, what is the definition of friendship? Isn't a feeling of being supported and protected a part of it? Do people not build a friendship so that they don't feel lonely? So they feel included? Well, apart from occasional beers and lunches, I am not getting anything from these ghosts.

Now, I haven't considered myself depressed and have a loving long term partner. But when I get upset, I get very uncontrollably upset. I guess this has always happened but I'm more self aware of it. I don't lash out and in fact most anyone doesn't notice, I try to avoid anyone and it's hard to talk when it happens.

For example my mother has always been rather overbearing and due to other issues (autistic) I've struggled with getting a job. I was having tons of anxiety about it and feeling like a burden to the point where I couldn't sleep, and have been applying. She angrily messaged me about how ""I would think you'd be concerned about getting a job"" and other things basically accusing me of not caring or trying, when caring has caused me tons of anxiety already. This caused a flood of emotions that I realize after is very irrational, I get very depressed and suicidal. Self hatred. Like my old depression comes back full force temporarily. It gets hard to move, I would stare at objects and not really process what I'm doing. In these moments (hours-days) suicide seems completely logical and there's no rational force in my brain. A while later I might be fine. This can't be normal right? 

 I also get uncontrollably upset (cry easily) when others are angry, even if it's not at me.  These irrational episodes end up making me hate myself more, especially since it might look like I'm doing it on purpose to make it about me. Weirdly my emotions are fairly flat otherwise, I don't cry easily at sad movies etc.

97,"So I recently, for the first time ever, started going to a counselor for my mental health. That was a big step for me. I feel like anything I do, whether I enjoy it or not, requires all my strength to motivate me to do and leaves me feeling drained (especially when it’s something I don’t want to do like chores). So something like seeking mental health required ALOT of motivation after months (maybe more) of procrastination. I’m not in a crisis, or suffered from trauma, or anything very serious. I just know my mental health is degrading and is affecting my work and my relationships and my outlook on life. I’ve been to 5 one-hour sessions now, and am feeling really discouraged. The first couple sessions had me feeling really hopeful (she suggested I could have adult ADHD, which I’d never considered, but after I did my own research I learned I fit a lot of the signs). Now, not so much. 

I’ve got two things I would love feedback and help with. One, I’d like to know if my therapists behaviors are normal of a good therapist. And then I’d like ANY help and input on how to find a therapist that works for you and what some red flags are. 

So firstly, if anyone else has had professional help, please let me know if this is typical, but here are some things that have me questioning this therapist (and try to ignore my bias in there, I’m obviously discouraged and viewing this therapist in a negative light):

1. Two of the five sessions, she said she couldn’t find the notes from her last session. So I felt like I spent half of that hour I had recapping everything we’d talked about in the past. I felt that about some sessions she did have her notes too. She’s repeated examples in sessions so I feel like she’s forgotten what we talked about. 

2. She gave me a printed article off the internet to read about ADHD and told me to ignore the ads for medicine at the end. I would’ve expected a scholarly article or maybe an excerpt from a book, but again, never done this before so I don’t know. 

3. This one really has me bummed. I work 8-5 and can only have appointments after that. Her 7 slot is the only one I’m able to get into, and so I’m always her last appointment. Every appointment now, she has mentioned what a long day it’s been and how she’s tired, and one time she asked to she end the appointment early. She did say she thought she was sick, so I figured ok this is a fluke. But five weeks of acting similarly? It makes me feel like she just wants to leave and she isn’t really paying attention.

4. At our last appointment, she told me she didn’t really know where to go from here. I guess she meant how to start helping me. After five sessions would a normal therapist still not have pinpointed what issues should be worked on? Or not have a plan in mind for where to go from there? She said she’d talk to her friend who’s a nurse practitioner about some things (I guess where to go from here with me). Which also seemed like a red flag, kind of like the random internet article. 

So there is all that. Any feed back would be appreciated. And from here, how should I go about finding a therapist who works for me? What are some red flags and what are some green flags in that process?

Thanks

The a second later, i came back, i told myself 

“I died, now what do i do” 

In that moment i was in the understanding that i had died there, and i am now here. To continue this life in a different universe so to speak. 

I was scared that when i got home, the bed may be in a different spot, with my girlfriend telling me it’s always been there. Or that i would be driving and realize that “wait, the powerlines were on the other side of the road before” but as time passed, i noticed nothing different. 

However, about a week ago, i went to feel a mole i have always had on my stomach that i would always randomly touch, and i couldnt find it. I looked at my stomach and felt around and i am 100% sure that there used to be a mole there. 

I have stayed convinced that i had died there and am now living here. I understand this is not normal, yet I don’t know why i feel this way or what to do about it. ",06Feb2019,1

100,"I am a 25 year old male who has self diagnosed ptsd, adhd, and dyslexia. I have been dealing with anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts a good portion of my life. I am currently working with a therapist but would like to get some things off my chest and seek others opinions as to what I should do. I am also currently taking fluoxetine, adderall and Buspar which I belive is what has allowed me to come to reddit to ask for help. 

P. S. Sorry if the post is confusing/long ask me anything and I'll try to explain anything better. 

My past

My past wasn't that bad or that's what I tell myself. I was bullied when I was young by who I thought where my friends. My father was a narcissistic and used what I now know as Gaslighting. My mother was a drug addicted and was gone for about a year of my life she has since then fixed herself. We where not poor by any means at that time in my life, later on my family had to live in a small camper with a lean to on the side of it in WV. I don't remember a lot of things in my life and as I talk more about it more things tend to come back to me. When I was in high school I was sexuly abused by my school's physical trainer, he committed suicide after others reported him for doing the same thing to them. I was asked if he did anything to me and I told them no because his family was going through enough I didn't want to add more to that pain. My father was sexuly attracted to my sister, I found father/daughter porn on the computer and also found out that not only she but his other daughter from a previous marriage was abused too. When I brought the fact that the porn was on the computer he denied and told me that I was crazy for think that he had done that. I also was attracted to my sister and did experiment when I was young with her, it was consensual, I still have strong feelings for her. I also experimented with my cousin who was a male. I have never been I a real relationship with a girl and have never had sex with another person. I had a couple of chances where I could have had sex with a girl but passed on them. I have on the other hand had sex with a dog twice, this fact has almost lead to me killing myself. My father was in the army and I really liked that about him and was the reason why I joined later in life. I always wanted to talk to him about his time in the service but he would get mad at me after talking about it to much. He on the other had would want to talk about how he didn't like sloppy seconds or other sexuly encounters. When I was younger I would have fits of rage and anger, I would take it out on animals and hate myself after doing this. I would also steal and lie now since I have gotten older the stealing has stopped but lying is still happening even when I try not to lie I still do unconsciously. My mother has always been there for me and not in a good way, I don't know if I could function if she died, she has held my hand up to this point in my. 

My thoughts 

I feel that my sense of reality is warped. I am sexuly actracted to role of my sister, not my sister directly, I would like my lover to be my sibling. I also don't want to cut corners when it comes to a significant other I feel that they have to meet certain standards. I am a furry and I am also attracted to animals. I absolutely hate myself for eveything that I have done that was the wroung or incorrect. I now second guess eveything and am unsure if something really did happen in my life. I am afraid that I might be mentally disabled or retarded. I feel that I can't keep a friendship and always blame myself for losing people or not gaining friendship. I also don't want to risk making new friends because I fear that I will look stupid. I can be over emotionally on the wiredest things like inanment objects. I seek out things that are emotionally sad and day dream about how I could sacrifice myself or that if I had a tragic past and that it would make me stronger or special. I also sometimes like for things to be taken away from me, by this I mean like a lover being stolen or raped where you have that heart ache, this also has turned me on before. I also daydream where I have killed people before, I have them where I am the bad guy and some where I am the good guy. I don't care about most of my family and wish something bad would happen to them so they could learn from the experience. I really want to have someone care about me but I don't want anyone to get close to me. I also have gotten physically sick when showing signs of affection, this doesn't happen all the time though. I am afraid of talking to girls that I find attractive its is a imoblizing fear. My mind also goes straight to sexuly thoughts when talking to most females. I like drugs and how they make me feel and have abused them before. I wish things like pokemon where real and I also find I am sexuly actracted to them. I am unsure if I am bisexual and am afried that I might be. I also think I might be a narcissistic which just make me hate myself even more.

101,"Hello, im 17. Im curious if there is a name for what i experience. Sorry for my bad english, it's not my first language.

TLDR at bottom

As long as I can remember, I don't (barely) feel things like sad, happiness, pity etc. I'm not depressed, i just dont't care how I feel, im certainly not sad. Thing is, since these emotions don't come naturally for me, I try to have them in the right occasion. Like, when a kid who lives near me drowned, my mom told me and she was like oh thats so sad, this feeling did not just come up in me, In my head I tried to tell myself why I should be sad, giving arguments to myself. 

So i try to have certain emotions in certain situations, but I have to manually convince myself to have those emotions as they dont come up naturally, and they're not even real, they're there so other people can see it. I honestly don't care about most things, like when a friend was telling about his holidays, i try to be interested but it is so hard to fake it.

TLDR: In situations emotions don't come naturally for me, I manually convice myself with arguments why I should have a certain emotion at a certain occasion. I don't give a sh*t about what happens, even if I try to give it.",06Feb2019,1
102,"How would you deal with this situation? Yes, my father flipped and he rushed to the kitchen room to grab whatever it's there, and he was yelling he would stab me to kill. My mother was standing in between us, and I thought she would be the first one to get stabbed. I was feeling sick in my stomach. My father did verbally threaten to murder her a few times before. He came back from the kitchen, and he ended up just rushing at me with no weapons. Here's what you need to know. He used to be an alcoholic for 7-8 years. He's been clean for years now, but whenever he flips, he's unstoppable. For the first time, I really thought I might kill him before he does. I was scared. I have been mentally unstable for ages. I was diagnosed chronic depression a long time ago, and I've gone through some very dark time.

Anyways, he just couldn't stop rolling his madness for hours. He threatened with some deadly weapons like a dumbbell, golf club, and whatever he could have grabbed sitting around. He choked me and continually asked me to kill him myself. Saying that that was the only way to end this. I am still thinking right now, if I wasn't lucid at that time, I really might have killed him, because he was pointing a sharp corkscrew under my throat. I tried to leave, but he kept wrestling me. I ended up bleeding in my finger. He grabbed my hand and rubbed my blood on his face.

After 2 hours, I managed to calm him down. He said he got angry because I cursed at him. I apologized. I told him we were having an elevated conversation, and I happened to speak my mind. I told him I was verbally absued for my entire life, saying that now he should have understood my pain a bit. He said it's tolerable for him to do such things in a parent-child relationship to tease me if it is necessary. I cannot convince him otherwise so I am done with that.

I want to deal with this situation like an adult. I cannot go back to what I used to be. But, I cannot help but picture in my head, him rushing through the ktichen with madness in his eyes yelling that he would fucking stab me to death. He seriously meant his action. So this is fucked up. What kind of fucking father have I made him to become? I feel responsible as a family member. At the same time, I honestly have no affection left toward him. I cannot look at him anymore. He dies tomorrow, I shall be fine. Maybe I want him to gone.

105,"For months now I’ve been hearing things that I don’t think are there. It started I think around October maybe? I know what’s real and what isn’t (now that I think about it, don’t we all?), but I still hear them and it creeps me out sometimes. 

Anyway, the things I hear are usually voices. I normally can’t tell what they’re saying, it sounds like they’re speaking another language most of the time. They usually talk quietly, as if they’re standing on the other side of the room and they don’t want me to hear them, or they don’t know that I’m there. Sometimes I hear someone whispering in my ear. They say seemingly random things like “good morning” out of nowhere. Sometimes a voice will repeat things and its usually something kind of unsettling like “you need to get out”. 

I know auditory hallucinations are usually associated with schizophrenia, but people with bipolar and even anxiety can hear things too. I’m not asking anyone to diagnose me with anything, only if someone else can relate. It wouldn’t surprise me if no one replies but whatever. I’m already considering giving therapy one last try, but this time bringing this up. 

I don’t know if these voices were maybe triggered by the sleep paralysis I occasionally have? It started back in August and it’s like the voices I hear while having sleep paralysis somehow made their way into my waking life. 

Does anyone else here have auditory hallucinations without ever experiencing psychosis? The things I hear don’t usually scare me, but they’re weird and I’m kind of worried it could spiral into something else, as most people in my family are mentally ill to some degree and everyone has different symptoms.

106,"Every day, I struggle with knowing whether I should be an open book about my anxiety and depression, or if I should shut myself off from the world. 

I feel like blogging or posting on Facebook can be a good way to work through my feelings, and it can possibly help others who may be struggling to know they aren't alone. But some days, I feel like that opens the door to hateful or hurtful comments from other people, and it makes me want to quit all social media and live a quiet life with just my favorite music and books.

I have no idea what the right answer is because my thoughts on this change daily. On really bad anxiety and depression days, I want to retreat. I cancel all plans and cocoon up in my bed because I feel like my mental health is no one else's business but my own. On good days, I apologize to my friends for canceling, beg for forgiveness, and am very candid about my mental health. 

The cycle repeats, and I feel like I'm stuck in an endless loop of shitty emotions.",06Feb2019,1
107,"tl;dr - My mental health sucked. I was stagnent on anti-depressants and it caused a lot of damage in my life. Based on self-analysis and some research, I worked with my doctor to get a stimulant added to my care plan and found amazing results.

Since this post does relate to controlled substances and mental health, I was to make it very clear that I am not advocating (a) obtaining stimulants without a valid prescription from your doctor or (b) taking stimulants without first talking to your doctor. Possessing a prescription drug, especially scheduled drugs like these, without a prescription if very illegal and taking medication without your doctors guidance and authorization can have dangerous or deadly results. Now that the PSA is out of the way, away we go:

I’ve been getting treatment for depression and anxiety for years. The first couple of years were horrible, changing up the medication left and right with nothing but horrible side effects and in most cases, intensified symptoms. I finally talked with my doctor after doing some research on my own and started a combination of tricyclic anti-depressant and a beta blocker (for anxiety and high BP). This was the best I had felt in as long as I could remember, my depression and anxiety weren’t gone but I didn’t feel so down that I want to die and my anxiety is in check enough to stop me from feeling like I’m absolutely insane. Years passed by and my personal life was falling apart and I couldn’t figure out why. My wife left me, friends stopped calling, I hurt or offended almost anyone I interacted with, but I never felt like that’s what I was doing and if someone pointed out what I was doing wrong, I thought they were just being too sensitive.

My wife leaving me was like a bucket of ice water being dumped on me in my sleep, the reality check that I had so desperately needed for far too long. I finally sat down and decided to pick apart every details I could come up with about how I’ve been acting. I was being more cognizant of what I was thinking and how it influenced how I was speaking/acting. I wrote down a list of what I was doing wrong, then boiled that list down to why I was doing those wrong things, what “symptoms” were causing me to do this? I then turned to Dr. Internet and searched for stories of people with like symptoms and found information I wasn’t expecting. I found tons of anecdotal accounts of how psychostimulants (such as and most frequently referenced, amphetamine salts) had improved their lives by leaps in bound when added to their pre-existing medication regimen. I thought surely must just be stories by people who are hyping it up to justify getting a pill that is known to be abused for academic and occupational advantages. So I then adjusted my search query to focus on real data from accredited and trusted institutions. I found an [NIH study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3181580/) that covered almost every question/concern that I had, one if the biggest being risk of dependency (I have a family and first-hand history of problems with addiction). They found that patients were randomly cutoff from their stimulants and monitored for withdrawal symptoms but never showed any (they did note than the patient was clearly without the therapeutic/beneficial effects of the stimulant, but no withdrawal). What really caught my eye was the note near the end that said patients 

I took all of this information to my doctor ready for a tough talk and worries that I’ll be viewed as a drug seeker. She was very receptive, I didn’t even use most of the information I had available. Her main concern was what affect it will have on my already difficult-to-control anxiety. I asked if her concern was so great that it outweighed the possible benefits and she responded with a quick and simple “no.” I let her know that I would be more comfortable with the extended release so that I’m not getting a flood of amphetamines that probably *would have* had negative effects on my anxiety. She concurred and we discussed the best dosage to start on and that was that, quick and easy. I picked up my prescription on my way home and started taking it the next day. I will note: I have been seeing this doctor for years and she knows me and my mental health very intimately, which I’m sure made that discussion a lot easier than if a new patient came in asking for a controlled substance.

What is this feeling? Is that actual happiness? When I see my wife, is this what love actually feels like? I want to get off the couch and actually go out and have a social life - that’s different. And the biggest shocker... where did my anxiety go? Wow, I’m not stuffing my face all day long and drinking myself to sleep every night. My weight is gradually working back to my normal weight from before I started the anti-depressants. I feel empathy and actually care how the people around me feel. I don’t get jittery/tweaked out. I can skip doses as needed to prevent tolerance without any bad side effects other than maybe being a little sleepy or distracted. It feels like the medication I was on was doing 50% of the job and the stimulant brought that up to 100%. I am absolutely amazed with the results.

I finally could see that all of those years that I was “doing okay” I was just not aware of or capable of feeling much of anything. No pain is good right? No. I feel like I’m the me that I had long forgotten ever existed. Unfortunately, the damage I had done to those I love was severe and dragged on for years. While most have forgiven me and embraced the new me, my wife is still very hurt and it is going to take a lot of work on my part, mixed with time and patience, but I am positive that if she can find it in herself to afford me the time to demonstrate how much I’ve improved and continue to improve, I can earn hear love back again. I’ve known that I loved her all this time, but I was incapable of feeling and reciprocating love in a passionate or meaningful way.

I hope this has been interesting or helpful in some way. I mostly wanted to get it out there so that if someone else is in the position I was in and hasn’t already thought about this, they can do their own research and talk to their doctor. I’m also interested to hear if anyone has had similar or opposite results.

Take good care of yourselves and thanks for reading!",06Feb2019,1
108,"So, [23M] writing here for the first time. 
I’ve been through something that has scarred me probably forever. Making relationships or even having a small interesting conversation with someone I like is almost impossible. I’ve been detached from social life completely for a few years now and it has become a habit, to a point where I don’t know what to talk or how to behave around people. I’ve tried anti depressants, anti anxiety and a few mood enhancing drugs too but none have helped. Meditation, hobbies, responsibilities, a job and anything that would keep my mind off, but not one thing helped.

I’m looking into the future and I don’t see any difference in my lifestyle, neither any happiness nor anything to live for. Everyday kinda repeats over and over again and the mere thought of that kills me.
I see people being normal doing normal things like I did several years ago and I don’t even understand what’s going on or how they are able to it or what part of me broke or how I couldn’t see when parts of me were being ripped apart over the years. I walk away when people approach me, most just talk out of sympathy and that makes me feel worse. 

I end up trusting the same person who watched everything happen and I for some reason I end up trying to stick to this same person who mocks me for what I am today.
This person shattered me to a point where I’m beyond repair, and I can’t help but dwell on these horrible memories while this person’s voice repeats endlessly. This just makes want to kill every damn person from my past, 
I’ve been thinking about this for a few years and came to a conclusion that the only way to get rid of all this is to leave this damn place, my family, to a completely isolated place where I can grow my own food and live like a tribe or something. Idea here is that I own my freedom and a calm peaceful life with nothing to worry about. Moreover, my family wouldn’t see me suffer, when they realise. ( They see me as a leech who feeds on them. I’m just lazy and pretending. )
On the other side I just want to end myself because nothing seems to make sense other than the fact that no matter how much I achieve, I’d still look for something that I’ve lost and end up being unhappy. A lot of struggle and I don’t know if I can go any longer.

( I’ve been learning a few technical courses to get a job hoping that would stimulate me. But I know after a couple of months I’d be counting days, hours and minutes eventually. 
Also this whole psycho thing has drastically reduced my overall cognition, simple math has become so damn confusing which just adds on to more negative thoughts. )

That being said, I need plenty of advice that would help me and also others who feel the same.

I’ve applied and attended interviews in bouts. Generally the pattern is straightforward: I apply, apply and apply, begin to feel down due a lack of progress and, due to this, give up and slip into depression. Alternatively, I’ve been invited to an interview, failed and become severely depressed.

Recently, I’ve started applying again. This coincides with the birth of my second child who is now seven-weeks-old. I’ve been to one interview and failed. I’m also starting to find that initial successes (being called by recruitment companies etc.) are starting to die off already.

128,"To preface this, I have borderline personality disorder (BPD), OCD tendencies, and also PMDD. I have made huge strides in correcting my behavior and I’m in a place now where people can’t even tell I have issues. I’m sorry if you’ve been hurt by someone with BPD in the past, but please don’t take it out on me here. We’re not all the devil incarnate when we get the right help. 

So usually I just lie completely to my therapists, especially because I’m very paranoid and fearful of authority. I never tell them that I drink alcohol once a week (I once got labeled as an alcoholic because I only drink on Friday OR Saturday nights but I have 3-4 drinks in one night. Now I just say I don’t drink at all. I don’t even like drinking, sometimes my friends will want to check out a new brewery and we’ll sit there for a few hours. Being an “alcoholic” was on my permanent record for years and I would be refused medications like antibiotics until I met a new doctor who thought that was ridiculous and took it off my record.) 

Usually talk therapy is enough for me, but lately I’ve been extra depressed and angry and I think I might need to turn to medication in order to keep my life from flying off the rails. I am barely holding it together right now and have barely been holding it together for the last few months. 

I smoke weed only before I go to bed. My brain feels like it’s full of bees and my heart feels like it’s full of moths. Negative thoughts are buzzing through my brain and my heart feel so heavy and flustered all the time. I can’t force myself to be happy doing things I used to enjoy. Weed dulls the sensation of constant agitation and irritability. I can smile and laugh again while I’m high. I enjoy reading and watching my boyfriend play video games again. Then I fall asleep blissfully, only to feel terrible again upon waking. 

Recreational marijuana was legalized in my state, but it is not federally legal, so I know it’s still possible to be marked as a  drug abuser for smoking weed and be barred from accessing psychiatric drugs. To complicate things, I work for the federal government and possess a security clearance, which makes it extra bad for me to be caught. I can never have a medical marijuana card (even though my state doesn’t consider mental health issues as qualifiers for them anyway). Because of my job, it is also very important that I avoid an actual diagnoses of BPD, which is grounds for my clearance being taken away. I actually have a good reason to be paranoid about that. The therapist I’m seeing now doesn’t believe in diagnoses, so I am safe with her. I can’t stay with her because she also doesn’t believe in medication and I think I really need that as the next step in my treatment. 

I just wish I could be honest with my doctors. My current plan was to go to a new doctor for depression and anxiety and not mention the BPD or the weed, and see what happens. But I’m going to be extra miserable without being able to smoke at the end of the day to wind down, and I also feel bad about lying about what kind of treatment I need. I don’t know if it’s my paranoia and fear talking, but I feel like doctors don’t really want to help me and I’ll just be screwing myself over for life if I’m honest. I’m not dangerous or reckless or a threat to national security. I’m just very sad and I need help. ",06Feb2019,1

Be kind but honest please.

So I had an idea that I wanted to get some feedback on.

Obviously wouldn't be doing this for profit or for the hopes of turning into a youtube star or anything, I kind of just want to provide validation and potentially insight for people with similar mental health issues as me. Idk about other people but I have found very few videos discussing the topic that weren't condescending or pandering or felt like a cash grab.

I was wondering if this sounds remotely like something anyone would be interested in? If even a couple people thing it might be cool I'll give it a try, I'm doing it for myself as well to get my thoughts out of my brain, so any interest at all will be reason enough to give it a go.",06Feb2019,1

**this is long, please read its entirety.** 

(for the potential reader, i am not suicidal or going to harm anyone or myself. this is just the thoughts in my head. i am trying to find out if i am on a path to psychosis. which comes and goes.) 

&amp;#x200B;

my head is wild, its out of control and its like i dont know who i am. not like schizophrenia or anything like that but that doesnt seem too out of reach for my current state. its like i am a secret psychopath. i have never done anything psychopathic before but its almost like, i can relate to those who are psychos. i was raised pretty normally except my dad is abnormally controlling. never violent or abusive really, but almost like he has a God complex. 

&amp;#x200B;

see, i never capitalized anything other than God.(which i never do, for some reason this writing is different) so its almost like i am one form of normal, and i understand that God is the higher power within our universe. but i never feel normal, i never feel like i fit in to anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

my mind is wild, it cant be controlled. i heard someone on the radio today say something about some hormone injection they got that helped them think more and have so many more thoughts. i laughed because i cant stop thinking. i dont necessarily ever have complete thoughts because i have so many. i can never finish anything, thoughts included. its extremely frustrating for me, but i can imagine it is frustrating for those around me as well. i sleep pretty dang good though almost every night i sleep really well, so its not like my mind doesnt shut off ever.

&amp;#x200B;

its just when my eyes are open i am having many thoughts, they contradict each other too. which is an even bigger frustration for me. one second i want to be a national internet criminal, the next i want to goto seminary and follow that path of going into ministry, then the next i am back to being an i.t. guy at our family business and eventually take the reigns from dad, then i want to start my own company in the same industry and be independant then i want to be a computer programmer or web dev. i can never be consistent, its like my focus lasts for 2 weeks max then im on to the next goal. its a miracle i have stayed married for almost 6 years.

&amp;#x200B;

which i am blessed to have done it because i probably wouldnt stick with me as long as k has. shes done really well with the kids too. they would have driven me mad by now. 1 is constantly saying ""mommy"" and whining for snacks or milk and 2 is always screaming for food since 2 is only 1 year old. now, i wont even name my kids or wife in this...why? i have no idea, what makes me think i am writing some kind of secret manuscript with nuclear codes in it or something. its like i wish to live in this fantasy land where i can do it all, and experience all different paths of life. did i mention that one of my other constant desires is to be a farmer and help my family become independent from the 'grid' and from the modern luxurys of society? 

&amp;#x200B;

see, i never really experienced a lot of life, which i am glad about. morally, i dont think college is a good place, i think there is a lot of sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll if you catch my drift. i always feel glad that i never went to college just because of that, i feel like its a breeding ground of sin and immorality. which shows that i do have some sort of moral compass. which comes from my upbringing. i was raised in a 'christian' home, went to christian school all except one year which i returned back to the christian school because i didnt care much for the public system. my parents are christian just not super involved. they had christian morals as a guideline but it was never strictly enforced or anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

in school, i had a really hard time staying focused in class, i had no interest in it as a general rule, it was all too slow for me maybe, i would get bored. my grades were terrible. if it werent for k, i would have failed miserably, she did some final work for me to make sure i graduated. i am ever grateful to her for that. 

&amp;#x200B;

sometimes my temper is bad, i lose it on the road sometimes, but i never show it, another secret thing i keep to myself, things make me really mad sometimes. but i am usually really quick to get over them. 

&amp;#x200B;

i have overcome a few things in my life too, i am what some consider to be, 'white privelege'. my parents were raised by east and south texans, which to say the lease were not the most open to other races. so we had a touch of prejudice in our house hold, but it wasnt out of hatred, it was out of not knowing any different, i have now helped my family overcome some hesitance towards newcomers in our family which are not white. which is a big deal since in high school i was disciplined for posting very racist comments on the internet. but i found a deeper relationship with God, and found that i was very wrong and have since changed my mindset on that. also, i was pretty much an addict to pornography starting at age 10 or so, until the fall of 2017 when i was 23 years old i have been free of that addiction for nearly a year and a half, and now use that as one of my biggest turning points in my faith.

&amp;#x200B;

now my main struggle is controlling my thoughts, like i said before i constantly and rapidly change my mind. the show, done by netflix in late 2018, called '""bandersnatch"" black mirror' has had a recent influence on my brain. its almost as if it opened a door that i did not know existed. its concept is rather anti biblical in the sense that they think that the world has multiple realities and its all controlled by some 'spirit' out there in the universe. very, free thinking outlook. i do get a sense that there are multiple realities, from the sense that person 1 sees things completely than person 2 does. they react to the same scenarios in extremely different ways. and that the 'spirit' out there in the universe is the Holy Spirit, of the one true God. one ending of the show that involves murder is not really attractive to me, but i find myself wondering what it would be like to be in his shoes, not wanting to kill someone, but wanting to understand what it feels like in his brain. i am confident that murder would be the thing that would kill my soul. i am confident that there is no way that i could stand the guilt of knowing that i ended someones life. i feel good about that. but the desire is still there to gain the understanding.

&amp;#x200B;

maybe thats my issue, is that i desire to understand it all, a desire to understand everything that is. maybe i have inhereted my fathers 'God complex'. i sure hope not. since it is one of my biggest frustrations with him. 

&amp;#x200B;

i desire solidarity pretty regularly. it is tough to be married and want to be alone. i like to think at times. i am really smart...intellegent i guess, smart to me means book smart, but i was never much of a studier ( i am at times ) but i feel that i have a high IQ, some of the ideas i have had as far as inventions in the retail or manufacturing world, i came up with originally, without influence of seeing the idea from others. though someone else, -usually a big conglomerant like samsung or apple- comes up with the product before i even think about starting it. however, the idea was original to me. anyways, i feel like a higher IQ and solidarity kind of go hand in hand. i tend to think that i could be alone forever, but i know that when the time came for my sex drive to gain control, i would end up in a very sinful situation very quickly. there are times when i desire to hug or kiss my wife without the intention of having intercourse though which shows me that i would get lonely if i was alone all of the time. yet, my mind still goes there. 

&amp;#x200B;

i have had thought tangents where i want to leave and be in the wilderness like a wild mountain man. with just me and my dog, cowboy like. but i dont know how i would fare the cowboy life. i am sure i would get bored. 

&amp;#x200B;

i feel like i live multiple lives though. i have the way i seem to other people, the way i am with my wife, and the way my brain thinks, and i am constantly suppressing the way my brain thinks. why? today, i thought about becoming a photographer to capture wildlife in its beauty. while simultaneously plotting my web dev business and my musical career, while morphing that into the idea of being an artist. then i entertained the fact that if i were to be a good artist i would need to use psycodelic drugs to get inspired, which goes directly against my thoughts 2 days ago to become a minister of some sort. 

&amp;#x200B;

i was medicated for adhd about a year ago, and felt a little difference, but i didnt see enough value from the cost of the meds, i would say that i got slightly more focused, but it was definitely not life altering. i am at a really weird spot in my life. i am not suicidal at all, not in a psychopathic break, i dont like to hurt people, i dont want to ruin my family, yet at the same time, the understanding of what would happen if...maybe thats what consumes me. i am really not sure. 

&amp;#x200B;

i will goto church tonight, and do some bible study. just learn a little bit, i have also asked to lead a young boys group that i was a part of as a child. i really feel like its a good opportunity to deepen my faith, my walk with God i feel will definitely benefit from that, others have suggested that i step up to the plate and do it, so they must see something that i dont. i dont really like kids. i like mine but they are little right now, this group is grades 1-5 and i think theyre all punks and feel like i cant really relate to them. maybe its Gods way of humbling me since i feel like im on a somewhat higher level when it comes to IQ and understanding the Bible. so i am open to it and am really praying about it. my nephew is in the group since we take him to church with us and he really would be excited. he doesnt really have a dad figure so, my dad and i have to step up sometimes. i think i will do it, and i think i will do fine. i was always told it is good to get out of your comfort zone. it makes you better. 

&amp;#x200B;

i just cant stop thinking that i dont fit in. like, if i really told people what i think they would think i am weird or stupid. i like being weird, i just dont want everyone to know it i guess. maybe i need to be more confident, maybe thats it. 

&amp;#x200B;

yet, while writing this, i am having a text conversation with my wife about buying a house. something i think would be good. not really sure. but i am sitting here having this weird mental thing happen, and i feel like if i showed her this she would think im a freaking weirdo and would probably want to leave me or think that i belong in a mental hospital. this is a rant i guess. maybe this is all i needed and i will never show this to anyone, who knows. like, why am i writing this in notepad?? no one freaking uses notepad, why didnt i use word? or google docs? who knows, maybe i am worried that google or microsoft will steal this and show it to the world. or maybe they would dub me as insane and i would be the next culprit in a government conspiracy, i dont know. i probably am a little, or a lot crazy. i just dont know what that means yet i guess.

&amp;#x200B;

i havent figured out how to channel the crazy. where can i use it as an asset? where can this make me stand out? maybe i want to famous. not really though because the limelight seems like its a little bright, and then i would be found out as a loon and that would be short lived. 

&amp;#x200B;

i notice that i have a strong desire to do nice things for people, but when it comes to helping my own wife around the house like doing dishes or cleaning around the house, i want nothing to do with it. it almost pisses me off that she even wants my help with such a menial task, when i have been 'working' all day, which really just means that i am sitting here having a mental battle with myself and i am worn out. i have done very little actual work today, which is exactly where i find myself every few months. i am in a lull...bored. why? i shouldnt be, i have plenty that i could be doing. but i weigh the potential consequences, or lack there of, and dont really care. why? no idea. but i dont. do i care about my family? sure i do, making sure they have food? of course, but do i care that i could lose my job if i didnt work for family? yes. but am i doing anything about it? no. why? no idea. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

im bored i guess. bored with my life. not sure how. i have a lot going for me. yet, for some reason i just dont care. i just talked to my mom for a few minutes and i seem totally normal to her. heck, i feel pretty normal to myself, but theres still this other part of me that cant figure it out? there is no way that feeling like this is normal. what does this mean?

&amp;#x200B;

am i just destined to struggle with who i am my whole life? or maybe, God is calling me? someone who is reading this that may not be religious will think i am a loon just for thinking that i hear voices from a God that they may not think exists. however, in the christian religion this is not something new. our entire religion is basically based on people hearing from God. 

&amp;#x200B;

all i know is i am tired of it. i am tired of feeling weird. one thing that has stuck with me is back in 2015, i lived in texas and i was about to move back to va and had just turned 21. my cousin(borderline alchoholic), uncle(alchoholic), and sister(drank often at the time) all asked if i wanted to goto the bar with them. being me, i said, 'nah i dont really drink.' my cousin immediately goes, ""yeah, you were always weird"" for some reason that stuck with me. i think because i was at this time already thiinking this way and i was afraid that i had been discovered as a weirdo. could this all boil down to me being insecure? i act confident. i feel confident most of the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

also, though i feel smart and like i have a high IQ. i am very intimidated by those that have college degrees. though, i really dont feel like i need one because of the immorality issue i mentioned prior. when i am at work functions and surrounded by people who are much more formally educated than i am, i feel stupid, or like i dont know as much as they do because when they speak they use bigger words or write more proper emails than i do. 

&amp;#x200B;

i also tend to oppose authority, at least in my head. i never outwardly show the resistance except to my father. for some reason i dont like run ins with police. i get extremely nervous and yet i act respectful to their face, in fact my neighbor is a cop and i am always nice to him and feel that he is a nice guy. i have never really done illegal things with the exception of some experimentation with weed in highschool nothing more than that. my good friend has experimented much more than i have. ive never been a bad person. i feel that i have a good heart.

&amp;#x200B;

throughout this writing, i still am worried that i didnt say enough. i didnt cover political views and views on recent experiences in my life. i will let the politics go. but i dont like to be around people. once i know someone or once someone starts a conversation with me i will start talking pretty quickly but i dont know how to start a conversation or keep a slow one going. i come off as rude or anti social most of the time. i think this is where i cant see myself in ministry. i can be blunt or sometimes just stop the conversation from continuing. by just losing interest, or not knowing what to say next to keep things going. i also text people when i need something instead of building a working friendship i just say ""hey, need you to ...... asap."" i have had people tell me that i am rude. but in my brain i just need something, take care of it and move on? i guess that is rude to other people. not really sure why? 

&amp;#x200B;

i love my children and wife. i dont want to go crazy like you see the people on tv. i want to be normal, i think? i just want to feel normal. maybe i dont. normal is boring. but how do i channel my weirdness? its like my mind is this deep abyss that just keeps getting deeper and deeper. but yet i cant focus on something long enough to channel my weirdness into it. its almost like i gain enough understanding about something to get the concept, but never really establish myself in it. maybe i got it...""3 Then he told them many things in parables, saying: A farmer went out to sow his seed. 4 As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. 5 Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. 6 But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. 7 Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants. 8 Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.""   this could be it. maybe the answer is to plant myself in good soil and dig deep enough to build up a root system and maybe then i will find myself. or maybe the goal is not to find myself...maybe it is to find God. 

&amp;#x200B;

but how? how do i control my focus? how do i not feel crazy? will the desire to understand things of this world leave me? 

 

by the nature of this letter i am sure people think that i am just a confused person with severe adhd. and mybe that is it. this is just a ramble from some severely adhd person. is that what this is?

138,"I don't really know where to start and I am honestly very insecure about writing this in the first place. English is not my native language so please be careful with negatively commenting about that since I know I will be effected by it if someone does. (or about anything else on here for that matter)

I don't know where to start or how to really explain so I am just going to throw it all out.

I would consider myself to be an unnattractive person nor do I see myself as capable of going to college and succeeding since I don't feel like I am intelligent enough, I haven't been outside for the past 3 years (maybe 3 times) after dropping out of high school. (I am graduating this year and I don't know what to do with my life which is another struggle) and I don't do anything else during the day then read, masturbate and daydream, I have the emotional awareness of a pineapple and I literally can't seem to understand or learn anything from my past mistakes in life. I don't have many friends because I'm honestly just odd in every way, I don't know how to have conversations with people and I don't understand why, (I personally think it's because I'm very unintelligent) I am incredibly insecure about anything I say or do in public and I feel almost paralyzed to an extent that I feel like I have to be careful with being myself every second or minute of the day. I sit in my room most of the day and don't do much other then masturbate, fantasize about kissing and hugging my imaginary boyfriend (jeez this sounds all really pathetic and sad) that I met online (which I have been talking to for the past three months and because I find him so attractive I didn't want him to lose interest in me so I lied to him that I would be visiting him next month in another country (not sure how to handle that situation either) I also always compare myself with everyone in literally EVERYTHING, I compare myself to my dad with how much better he cooks then me, I compare myself to my friend who seems to be naturally good at academics, I compare myself to people on instagram who seem to be naturally good at taking pictures, I compare myself to literally everyone about anything and it drives me insane because I am never satisfied with myself because of how unnattractive and uninteresting I feel as a person. I genuinely am very desperate at this point and don't know what kind of advice I'm looking for, maybe I just wanted to throw this all out because I'm a mess. OH yeah and also, I spend sometimes hours a day dancing or listening to music and imagining as if I am very pretty, liked by everyone and very intelligent and succeeding in every aspect of life.  I am pretty sure I am a maladaptive daydreamer which also consumes not only a lot of my time but makes my imagine things that I am planning in my imagination to do to become 'the perfect girl' that I daydream about being. I haven't been diagnosed with anything but I also suspect myself to be a HSP, ADHD and depression. I am not sure what to say now anymore and I am just going to post this without reading and see what people on here might respond with as advice.

OH and by the way I am going to a therapist for the first time in a very long time next Tuesday and hoping to get treatment for all my issues and just see what happens really, I am aware that I might sound like a troll because of the way I talk and stupidity in general but I honestly just want some help, I have no one to talk to and I feel overwhelmed by my mind and having to do it all alone.",06Feb2019,1

140,"So I’ve always dealt with toxicity, both from the people around me and myself, and recently I’m being the toxic person I tend to hate and I just need some advice on what I can do to be better and improve myself.

So, I get super jealous when my best friends hangs out with other people, and I try to hold it in and I always end up being more upset about it.

And of course anyone in my life has the right to hang out with other people, but I don’t know why I feel this way anytime one of my close friends sees someone else.

As some background, I had Disinhibited Attachment Disorder, so I tend to have issues with over attaching to the people around me and then struggling with jealousy and depression when things change. 

I would never tell anyone (especially my best friend) that they can’t hang out with someone else, but I don’t know how to express my feelings without making her think I’m unaware of my toxic/unfair/unhealthy thought processes.

And the other thing is that my best friend always wants to do things with me during the day, but I work evenings (often until midnight or later) and don’t have much time where I’m coherent during the day. And sometimes my thoughts spiral to “I guess if I can’t fulfill her want to do fun things in the day, then why should she not just replace me with this other person?”

And the other person is another friend of mine who moved an hour away and I don’t get to do much with anymore. They both don’t work and have all the free time they can to do things without me.

And I feel insecure as well about introducing them to each other and the fear of them getting closer and then ditching me.

So if anyone has any advice on how to communicate to my friend about this while also acknowledging that I recognize my unhealthy thoughts, I’d really appreciate it ♥️

TL;DR
My best friend is getting closer with someone else due to my unavailability and I’m having toxic thoughts about being jealous and wondering if I should just let them ditch me because I have trouble communicating my thoughts in a fair way.",06Feb2019,1

142,"Hi I'm Kate, I am working on a project to rework the experience of finding a treatment provider. I understand the process of finding a therapist or treatment professional leaves room for improvement (as I have personally been through it myself) and am interested in hearing about your experiences. All answers will remain fully anonymous, and I'm happy to accept direct messages or private responses on the topic. Thank you for your help!! 

* Can you tell me about the process you went through to find your current or past treatment professional (therapist, psychiatrist, doctor, treatment center, etc)? 
* What blockers (negative experiences, access limitations, lack of options, etc.) were present for you in that process? 
* What worked well in the process, what features of your search did you find helpful?
* Did you immediately find someone who was a good fit, or did that take multiple tries? Was there an option for specifying your individual needs during your search?
* Anything else you’d like to share about your experience with accessing and finding a care provider/ suggestions for improvement? 

Lastly, can you indicate whether this was a search for you personally or a family member or friend? ",06Feb2019,1
143,"I recently held a presentation in front of a group of 4 classmates. After just a few sentences I sort of had a panic attack, where I just felt that I would start crying if I continued, and I had to cancel the presentation. This was a major shame for me, since it never has happened before. Ever since then I have had an escalating social anxiety. Everytime since then when I need to speak in front of a group, big or small, I feel the same reaction coming. 

I study a pretty high intensity program in my countries equivalent of high school, where oral presentations in front of at least 10 people are not uncommon. This next week, on Tuesday, I am supposed to hold a presentation in English (which is not my native language). I have major anxiety as it comes closer. I am so afraid of that I will start crying or blush uncontrollably and inexplicably in front of the group.

The thing is, I usually am very social and extroverted. I used to love talking in front of people, and I love hanging out with friends still. This social anxiety and glossophobia has attacked me from nowhere, probably due to lack of exercise and sun the last couple of months. The lack of exercise comes from a skiing accident from a month ago along with sickness before that, both of which probably have screwed up my hormonal balances.

Should I avoid the presenation next Tuesday, and talk to my teacher about my problem? Or should I try to collect myself and do it, risking another ""attack"" and further social anxiety as a consequence? In the best case scenario I do the presentation and succeed, leading to my subconscious accepting that my fears are irrational. I know that I probably should seek help in both cases, and certainly in the former.

TL;DR: I am a social guy who gets panic attacks when holding presenations. Never had this problem before, and therefore I don't know if I should avoid further presentations until I have gotten therapy.",06Feb2019,1

145,"I've always known and for so long that I've had mental health problems, I put off dealing with it in a healthy way. I hid from it and distracted myself from the problem - well as much as you can, it never does work really does it?

So about a year ago I decided it was time to start doing something. I had a few crisis moments and ended up seeking help from emergency teams. They never seemed to take me seriously but it gave me the kick I needed. I went to my GP and I spoke about things. He made a referral for a psychiatric  assessment. I waited weeks for this, whilst filling out the mood charts and info they'd asked for. 

This assessment was done by a nurse, who then took her notes and everything to a meeting they have each week about their new referrals. A few days later I was sent a letter to tell me that they couldn't decide whether I had bipolar or borderline personality disorder but had advised my GP of which drugs to prescribe. Went back to my GP and he did this and explained that I would be unable to have any further psychiatrist appointments because I'm not a priority. 

I had to gradually increase my dose to the highest and for a while it's been working. My moods had stabilised and I felt I was getting better. I started paying for private counselling, however this really didn't help, we didn't click and all in all it was an awful experience that I don't want to repeat. 

However just recently things have been getting worse. A lot worse. So being an adult about it I made a self referral for an assessment to a ""secondary"" team who help those who are less of a priority - they came back to me and said I was too extreme. 

Now I'm feeling quite frustrated because I'm too much for one, not enough for the other and I'm only trying to do the best thing, the thing you're always told to do and talk, get help. 

So all in all over the last year;

* I've been to A&amp;E - who all but turned me away and told me to deal with it.
* I've been to my GP - who did what he could and referred me
* Had an assessment - which told me what I might have maybe, they don't know
* Been told I wasn't bad enough for support
* Tried to get myself some help privately
* Made calls to crisis lines when things have got so bad I can't cope
* Made a self referral and told I was too bad for support by that particular team

What can I do now?! I'm so close to giving in and deciding that this is the way my life has to be from now on. ",06Feb2019,1

Example2: I’ll be talking to someone and respond with a tone that almost sounds flirty but it’s ment to be monotone and just follow the conversation.

I will listen to really depressing music and watch depressing films and it won't shift my mood, sometimes I feel the slightest bit sad but only enough to notice that I'm sad and I can get on with whatever I'm doing.

I know it’s helped a lot of people, and I objectively know it can work; but I feel like every time I go into therapy I’m just being lied to and being fed false hope. How do I cope with the doubt that “This isn’t disordered, black and white thinking, I’m just legitimately a fuck up”? 

I guess I just don’t know what to do because I feel like my self loathing has gotten so bad that anything else just sounds like propaganda, and **I** know the real truth about myself. Would this be considered a delusion?

154,"(21,f) I have been in a dark, dark place.

I changed from a sociable, loving, person, to someone who feels nothing and does nothing.

I've had ""depressive"" periods multiple times throughout my life, but I never took any of them seriously because they would only last for a few weeks. But this time, it's different. I have isolated myself from everyone I know and love, family, friends, a guy that I liked, and I feel like something in me  is broken. I moved from a country where I was free to do whatever I wanted, to a place where my every move is controlled. Before I had moved back, I had gained 20 lbs, which made me extremely insecure to the point that I couldn't get out of the house, and I try to never look at mirrors.

for many months now, I have been spending the majority of my time in my bed. at some point, I had a month long holiday, in which I spent approximately 20 hours a day in my bed, I didn't talk to anyone, nor did I want to. My group of friends get involved in very ""problematic"" behaviors, that I'm not willing to be part of for the most part. Smy exboyfriend, who is very dear to my heart, and was a really good friend, cut me off because he started dating someone else, and this devastated me. I have a very ""flexible"" relationship with the rest of my friends, so it's not weird not to see them often. I have had an eating disorder for about 7 years now, and it seems to become worse and worse. At this point, I eat very little. Nobody knows about this and I dont trust anyone well enough to share this information, but my restriction of food only started a couple of weeks ago, not from the start. I have also been picking the skin around my nails to the point of bleeding, they hurt and look gross. 

I am unmotivated and unhappy, I don't go out unless I necessarily have to, I could say that I haven't been out with friends for more than 4/5 times in the past 2 or 3 months. something is wrong because I hate myself more and more every day. I can't date because I always end up hurting the other person, and I can't be depended on because I can easily disappear from peoples lives for weeks or months. I self sabotage, and I sabotage whatever relationship I'm in, orwhatever connection I have with other people. I enjoy being alone, so I push people away and freak out whenever Im close to anyone, even if we're just friends. I have lost joy in everything I used to enjoy, and I sleep for 12 hours a day whenever I can, I just watch tv in my bed feeling like crap about myself most of the time. I feel numb a lot of the time, sometimes I feel sad but I try to hide and control that even if Im alone. What the hell is happening to me?",06Feb2019,1

I've always had super crippling social anxiety. Someone thought I was mute after going to school with me for 4 years. 

I dont remember becoming addicted to food, since I was too young, but when I was 12 I began binging and purging. I started self harming at 14. My eating disorder got out of hand when I was 18, and I started smoking pot everyday at 20. Then at 21, I started drinking nearly every day.  Drinking and smoking kinda took over after that and it was pretty much my only issue for 2 years. 

Then I quit drinking, joined AA, started therapy, and STILL every other issue flared up. Plus I discovered my horrible dependency problems. I couldn't be happy if I was alone unless I was high or drunk. After 3 months of trying so hard to hold it together, I gave up. I was tired of my moods, I was tired of hurting myself, and I was tired of caring. I withdrew from friends, lost my health insurance, stopped therapy, and stopped taking all of my medicine

Now, after about 2 months of drinking and smoking all day everyday, I want to stop. This isnt how I want my life to be. 


Before I stopped therapy, it was strongly recommended that I check myself into rehab. It's starting to sound like a good idea. I'm pretty sure I'm going to seriously hurt myself if I try to get sober without help.


The problem is, I have no health insurance (the next open enrollment period is in October). I currently have about $4 in my bank account and am $500 in debt. 

I feel trapped, and a crazy part of me wants to just wait till I try to off myself or accidentally get alcohol poisoning. It sounds better then trying to figure this out alone. ",06Feb2019,1
167,"I’m not entirely sure weather this is the right place to post this but I want to know if this is normal or not?
 I’m an 18 year old male and over the last couple of months I’ve started to feel like I need to protect people younger than me, specifically my young friends and my older friends children. I know it’s not really any of my business but whenever I’m near younger people I start to worry that they’re in danger.

Is this something like parental instincts developing or am I just a bit odd?",06Feb2019,1

I am a third year Psychology and Counselling student at Teesside University. I am currently writing my dissertation which aims to assess why people with Mental Health problems use self-help blogs and forums. 

I will be using this Mental Health Subreddit to collect data for my dissertation, and I am wanting to recruit people who use this thread to be participants. Participation is completely optional. If you wish to take part, please email S6015890@tees.ac.uk to receive the information sheet and the consent form which will need to be completed and sent back electronically. 

To take part in this study, participants will be asked to write a piece around why they use mental health self-help forums or blogs. It will need to include why they are used, how/if they are helpful/unhelpful, whether it is used for support (either for yourself or others), is it for sharing experiences etc. Any other information you feel relevant is also welcome and encouraged. This response can either be emailed to S6105890@tees.ac.uk or replied to in this thread, whichever you prefer. 

All data collected will remain fully confidential, no personal details such as your name/age will be used; pseudonyms will be used to ensure confidentiality. Participants must be over 18 to take part, and must not be currently experiencing any mental health issues (you must be in recovery/recovered). 

This data will be used for the purpose of this dissertation only, and will not be published in any journals. There are no sponsors in relation to this research. 

Thank you for reading and I hope to hear from you soon.

I can't do techniques where is like ""keep your hands busy when you notice you're picking"" because you realize you're picking and so you do something with your hands but the moment you stop doing that you feel like you need to pick. So like obviously I can't be doing that certain thing 24/7. ",06Feb2019,1
170,"I thought I’d post this because I don’t think I’m the only one who’s struggled with this.

Today, with a therapist’s help, I realized that I try to help everyone, which ends up with me feeling emotionally exhausted. I knew that I was essentially becoming my father’s therapist, and I had recognized that it was too much. But I wasn’t even counting all the other stuff I was doing as a part of the issue. Somehow I didn’t realize that I was devoting a good amount of my time to helping friends and family members through emotional traumas and ailments. 

I’ve done therapy before, but I guess I never really internalized the idea of boundaries. I didn’t even realize that it was okay to have other options then being there for everyone 24/7. I only realized the problem when an “emergency” from my dad kept me up until 2am, even though I had to be up early in the morning. I always believed that being a good person meant supporting people through their tough times, but I guess I never learned where to draw the line - how to stop putting everyone else’s wellbeing over my own. It’s especially hard when people tell you that even what you’re doing now isn’t enough. 

Anyways, I just thought I’d share, in case there’s someone out there who needs to hear that it’s okay to say that you’re not able to help right now or to set up boundaries over what times people can contact you. If someone relies on you for everything and gets upset when you put up boundaries, that’s on them. (As in they should see a therapist)

TLDR: You’re not a bad person if you can’t be there for people 24/7 because you’re only human. If people make you feel bad for that, it’s on them. ~Important things you learn in therapy~",06Feb2019,1

172,"I’m located in Northern Illinois, also I’m sorry if this isn’t the right sub to post this in. I wasn’t sure where it belonged. 

To start, my best friend(18M), let’s call him Kyle, committed suicide in May of 2018. Kyle’s younger brother(5M), we’ll call him Dave, was only four at the time of his death. Dave has been dealing with anger management, emotional expression, and general confusion/sadness since Kyle died back in May. Since then he has developed some severe behavioral problems stemming from these emotional issues. His mom has been searching for a therapist specializing in children (and preferably grief) for the past couple of months with little to no luck. He has Kids Care and Atena insurance. We are looking for either some specific recommendations for therapists in Illinois who take this insurance, or just good resources to try and find one ourselves. We’d also appreciate any advice you guys could give us on better ways to handle Dave’s grief, as well as how to support him throughout this.

173,"Hello people of reddit,

I've had a lot of bad experiences the past 3 years. I.e. finding my father after he took his life, 3 bad breakups proceeding that, and my mom/family dissolving afterwards. I've left and moved across the country to a new area to escape my family issues and be with my partner. Despite all these hardships, I don't feel as if I've been scarred. The night I found my father I was actually pretty calm, with the typical, short emotional grieving outbursts later. I still do miss him and I won't pretend that it doesn't bother me at all sometimes, but all in all I feel I've handled it well, and my old therapist (whom I saw before I moved) seemed surprised at how well I was handling things and told me I have a good head on my shoulders).

Anyways, my partner and I are very happy in our relationship together (9 months, me 20, her 19). We are extremely committed to eachother and I'm basically a part of her family now, and I love them all so dearly.

But I've noticed that when I'm around her or just thinking in context of the relationship, I'm a lot more sensitive. I get more upset about the grief of my father and mother running away from my sister and I, daily stresses, etc. While I do genuinely feel these things, I love being comforted -  hugged, kissed, told it all will be okay. It's like I have this need for reassurance and comfort and I CRAVE being loved on. Although the loss of my father was really hard, I found so much joy and comfort in being basically coddled. Though, I'm told that I'm an extremely loving person and I'm often compared to a puppy.

I realize now that this isn't a healthy way to be, and isn't necessarily fair to my girlfriend either. It makes our fights a bit worse and I'm usually a little too over-apologetic because I crave reassurance that I'm not crazy, selfish, etc (hence my manipulative tendencies). The manipulative tendencies I have are mostly in this context, and I never want to hurt her or make her feel bad, but I understand that sometimes this causes her to blame herself.

I've always had an emotionally distant relationship with my parents, particularly my mother. I remember her being a great, loving mom at times, but sometimes it felt like she did it just to look good and most times I felt like I was a bother to her. If there's anything that crushes me, it's being told that I'm annoying. 

I'd like to figure out what this is and how I can better myself. I don't have any prominent mental illnesses that I know of. I do have ADD/ADHD and am obsessive on things sometimes. I suspect I may have dyspraxia but I need to see a professional and get evaluated. What are your guys' thoughts/advice?",06Feb2019,1
174,"I recently opened up to my two best friends (one since childhood and the other is a friend of 4 years) 
about my anxiety. I couldn’t tell them in person but I decided to message them about it since they always said to me I could tell them anything. 

The friend that I first opened up to it about (childhood friend) simply just replied with “ok” and then didn’t continue the conversation after me telling them about the recent issues I’m experiencing. 

My other friend (friend of four years) simply ignored it and then vented to me how they’ve had a headache all day, I told them to get some rest and take it easy but they didn’t reciprocate. After I told them to take it easy they didn’t message me back. 
However, this same friend has spoke to another one of my friends who suffers with anxiety and always listens to them/is there for them? 

Am I just overthinking this, or do my friends just not really care all that much?

175,"IC is imaginative companion which is different than an imaginary friend as a child. IC is an adult issue where your mind fragments off into another personality that exists in their mind or an object. Usually it's used to protect or nurture as a child but stays until adulthood. Similar to Identity disorders or multiple personalities, the character seems real and yet the user knows that they aren't real but just a part of themselves. It still causes issues in a persons life and the research is out there with lots of information so if you're interested in IC info check it out, it's very common and interesting but we still are slowly understanding it's effects",06Feb2019,1
176,"First off I want to say I hate self diagnosis And When people go around using anxiety as a cool thing etc.

I have been diagnosed with anxiety, a very bad phobia which they said has caused me minor PTSD (which I hate saying because I feel like a fraud).

In the many appointments with drs and therapists I have never mentioned my constant numbness, self harm, suicidal thoughts or how close I was to not being here today. I never mention the times I used to punch myself in the face to a bruise and blame it on the door, the time I spend now scratching skin off mt arms to relieve the pain. I feel like now its too Late rhey wont believe me? What good can they do? I know I am depressed I dont need to admit it to anyone I dont want to.

Pretty much since the start of this year I have felt more and more like I'm going crazy. My moods are more up and down than ever, if I dont cry a day its a miracle. I cried over stairs. I will go from beinf biting back tears to dancing across the room in less than 5 minutez without reason. I know this isnt just bipolar and I know I dont hve bipolar (though I do have some of the other features). 

Is this a thing? Is there a condition like this? Fo you have any advice?",06Feb2019,1
