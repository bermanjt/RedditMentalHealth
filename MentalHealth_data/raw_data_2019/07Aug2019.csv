BUT I am a Masters student who has finished all their course work and is stuck on their thesis. A year late finishing. And I want to finish so bad but I feel stuck on my topic and find it hard to have time to work on things and research with my full time schedule. 
I feel like my anxiety and depression and getting my confidence down, and I don’t know how to get back on the horse again. 

I feel stuck. Does anyone have any positive advice/ motivational quotes/ experiences that could help me get out of my rut and on the road to finishing?",07Aug2019,1

2,"I don't know when it all started, but it may have started when a girl rejected me when I was younger, and she blocked me on social media after I told her simply that I liked her. Anyway ever since then I can't be myself around women near my age. I seem to ignore and not talk to girls because deep down I know I'm afraid of giving them a nice attitude and being rejected again. Not even asking them out, I mean being nice and having a girl be mean. Im shy by nature, and I have no problem talking to dudes and older women, but ones who I feel attracted to, I avoid. Im almost 20 and I don't know what to do. I seem to have blamed my face. I have posted my face before if you want to see it, but the thing is, I don't think im ugly. I feel quite the opposite. However I seem to think every girl thinks it's ugly, since no girl has ever complimented me or has seemed interested in me. I started working out, and my self esteem has gone up since I have gained 20 pounds of muscle, but I still can't shake that feeling I have around girls. What can I do? Sometimes I think I may be ugly because nobody has said otherwise in person. I really need honesty.",07Aug2019,1
3,"I've been clinically diagnosed with moderate to severe depression and anxiety as of two years ago, but have been experiencing symptoms since I was younger.

It's gotten to the point where I can't compose myself whenever I have a panic attack or mental breakdown. These are mostly due to my self-loath, which begins to pile up little by little until the tiniest mistake makes me blow up. I don't want this to become a burden for my family, so I'm considering moving out, though it's not the most plausible or realistic approach given the current status of things (financially and personally). I've tried counseling for the third time (started at 11, I think – I'm 20 currently), and it only makes me feel worse. 

Any tips for bettering myself on my own? Should I even try therapy again?",07Aug2019,1

5,"You're NOT the Reason 

You're the reason I always look over my shoulder

The reason every night I toss and turn over

The reason I thought my body was love

The reason I constantly cry out above

The reason I am scared to be touched

The reason simple noises are just too much

You're the reason I feel dirty with grime

But guess what? You see, now it's your time

To feel my power inside


You're NOT the reason why I thrive

How everyday I grow, and fly

How my journey makes me find identity

On my own strength and serenity

You're NOT the reason why I am a butterfly

You tried to keep me in a cocoon on your time

But that wasn't the end, was it?

And you bury yourself in disgrace


You're NOT the reason I am strong

No, not at all.

6,"Im going to therapy soon and I feel like my thoughts are kind of dark. Not in a weird way but about how worthless I feel and how much I don’t want to be alive stuff like self-hatred etc. 

I used to self harm when i was younger but I know deep down if it ever came to it, I would never harm myself in a serious way. But I do think about death a lot and what everything would be like without me - which sounds like I am intending to harm myself. Id like to voice my thoughts without accidentally getting myself hospitalised. 

Does anyone know how to stay on the safer side of therapy? I dont really want to walk on egg shells in therapy and express my thoughts clearly but I feel like it will sound like I am a danger to myself. Is that the only reason they could hospitalise you? Or is there other things I have to be careful of?",07Aug2019,1
7,"Trigger warning: Talk of death, Cancer, Alzheimer’s/ Dementia, Anxiety, Depression

This is a throwaway account because my gf and friends know of my main reddit account 

Anyways...

Since the beginning of this year my girlfriend’s (of almost 5 years) mother has been sick and in the hospital where she, just as of last month, passed away. It’s been a lot for her given she’s only 20. To add onto this, her father has dementia and an increasingly bad case of it. Given that her household only consisted of her, her mother and her father, it being only her and her severely demented father was understandably too much for her. So for the past 2 months I’ve been living with her and her father, whom receives help but not nearly as much as he needs (her uncle stays over to keep an eye on him on week days but does nothing much else than watch him). Before all of these horrible series of events had gone down I had lived with my mother for my entire life (I’m only 19 after all) and I’ve found myself getting day by day more and more homesick. I feel so guilty for longing to just go home and return to my normal life visiting her normally once a day and having our space. The guilt comes from the fact that I’m sure she wants her normal life back too to when her mother was alive and happy and could handle taking care of her father. We both love each other greatly and that’s without a doubt. We’ve been through a lot of bs given that we met in high school amongst bullying, drama, rumors, hormones and all that jazz. I would never want to do anything to hurt her or her feelings but leaving her in what is obviously such a horrible time in her life makes me feel so overwhelmed with guilt even giving it the thought, especially given her history with anxiety/depression of which I also have a past of. At this point I’m probably rambling/venting so, to summarize:

My girlfriend of 5 years is going through an absolutely horrible time in her life and I’ve had to live with her and her demented father for a couple of months. I feel horrible evening thinking about leaving but it’s been so mentally exhausting I’m at a bit of an impass. Is there any advice that anyone could give me? Am I an asshole for wanting to leave? Any answers are appreciated. Thank you for reading this.",07Aug2019,1
8,"So I have noticed a dip in my mental preformance over the past year or so. I am a 26 year old female, and I was diagnosed with ADHD as a child.

Intro aside, I have noticed ive started to struggle with things like getting thoughts out, or actually saying a full sentence without jumbling up the last half. I regularly stumble over words, or fail to say a word over and over before I have to completely stop and restart what I was saying.

I also have noticed when counting (I work retail and have to count out mt drawer each day) that I stumble on numbers, specially 12-15. I get to 12 and then 13 seems like its not the right number to come next. It bothers me greatly since I always liked math and was quite good at it in school.

Im not sure what is going on, but it scares me. Im not sure if its just the ADHD, or if I have developed something further or worse.

TLDR: in the last year counting from 12 to 15 has caused me confusion, and i stumble over words a lot. Dont know why.",07Aug2019,1

12,"In 2016 I was admitted to a psychiatric hospital because I was having extreme suicidal thoughts. I was a danger to myself and felt like i was being forced to go, I wasn't. I signed myself in, as to not stunt any career in the future I may have been denied for having been forcfully hospitalized (302d).

On September 15th at 11:23pm I waited for the ambulance as my mother cried, I was feeling a lot of emotions at this time, none of them pleasant, and didn't say anything to her as i left.

15 days. 15 days of being locked in a hospital until I was considered recovered enough to leave. That 15 days felt like forever, and after the first few days I wasn't as upset as i was before. 

Staff was friendly, a little lazy and unorganized but they definitely knew how to set up a fun and friendly atmosphere. The food wasn't horrible, myself and my friends i had made would joke about stale bread or the off brand foods.

I met one person named Earl, who we called Will. He impacted me the most, as I only opened up to him about my substance abuse, to which he taught me easy ways to get myself clean. I was on Prozac at the time and gained the nickname Happy, despite me being depressed and generally high off of extremely high doses, (80mg was my first dose). 

I was staying in Southwood outside the Pittsburgh area, i definitely didn't receive the help i actually needed, but i was shoved in the right direction and met very good people who got a bad hand in life.

I don't have contact with anyone I met there and sometimes wish i did, just to see how they're doing after 3 years, but overall going to an inpatient hospital was worth it, if I didn't go i probably wouldn't be alive today.

I apologize for how disorganized this may be or how poorly put together it is, it's just something I never talked about, when my friends ask me where i was i just say locked up or in rehab.",07Aug2019,3

14,"https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/toxic-relationships/201901/all-you-should-know-about-covert-narcissist

This article (among others) has me feeling distressed. I recognize a lot of this in myself. Except for the lack of empathy and feelings of superiority. I'm confused about whether a covert narcissist feels superior or not, this article seems to contradict itself a bit? 

I'm sensitive, I'm insecure, I'm self conscious and shy. Which is actually self absorbed when you think about it. Small talk bores me, I suppose I'm not overly interested in people. It's hard to say if that's because I'm a narcissist or if it's because I have generally had shitty interactions with people in life lol

Is there overlap with people who have low self esteem, feelings of emptiness, and covert narcissism? I guess I have periods of time where I do feel like I'm being unjustly treated, and I get resentful of that. It's hard not to think that this is an example of ""They take things personally and feel distrustful, mistreated, unappreciated, and misunderstood. Although they devalue themselves, they dream of greatness and wonder why people don't appreciate and understand them."" I don't dream of greatness but I do find myself often feeling misunderstood and mistreated. I often feel empty. Is this just depression/anxiety though?

16,"Hello.  I am not sure whether I am suffering from clinical depression or some other psychological ailment.  I've had a persistent feeling of listlessness for several years.  My academics have been about as mixed a bag as possible.  I've earned perfect scores on just about every standardized test I've taken (ACT, SAT Subject Tests, APs, etc.) and jumped ahead 6 years in math as well as 4-5 in science.  On the other hand, I've failed to advance in two olympiads (neither of which I studied for, so the blow to my intellectual self-esteem was hardly crippling) and been rejected from several precollege and early college programs, two of which I even considered to be far beneath my ability (my ACT score, based on published data, was strictly greater than those of literally every admitted student in one case).  It feels like the universe is mocking me.  Give and take, give and take.  Tantalize me with the suggestion that I could have merit, and then crush it in an instant.

My past hasn't helped me to center myself.  I was never recognized as gifted in public school.  Indeed, I was diagnosed with ASD and provided with special education services.  My experience in elementary school severely traumatized me and led to perennial refusal to attend school.  The administrators would threaten me, send monitors to shadow my every move, and manhandle me into a so-called ""safe room"" (in actuality a sensory deprivation chamber where I could be confined for upwards of 20 minutes) for such minor infractions as contumacy and swearing.  The gifted program used its own battery of shoddily-constructed assessments and refused to accept genuine IQ tests out of equity concerns.

Forgive me if I indulge in what may regrettably appear to be boasting.  It's not, and I can't talk about this without discomfort in real life.  It turned out that I was measured to have a verbal IQ of 164 (99.999th percentile).  It should be noted that a fair amount of conventional wisdom regarding scores like that seems to be predicated on the large corpus of psychometric data amassed from years of assessment with the now-outdated Stanford-Binet Form LM.  The numbers produced by that test have consistently been shown to be wildly inflated, to the tune of a 130 on a modern Wechsler sometimes translating to 200+ on the old Binet.  Commensurately, many may underestimate the degree of maladjustment that such a score on a modern test implies.  Since deviation IQ scores are directly tied to a normal distribution, the gap widens between the (MA/CA)*100 ratio score and reported IQ as one considers more and more aberrant scores.  I attained raw scores of 53, 35, and 30 respectively on the Vocabulary, Similarities, and Comprehension subtests of the WISC-IV at age 8.  These scores correspond to mental ages of &gt;16:10 (greater than 16 years, 10 months, which is as high as the charts go), &gt;16:10, and 15:10.  ""&gt;16:10"" is likely an underestimate, however -- this band begins at a raw score of 49 on Vocabulary and 31 on Similarities.  My performance IQ was so much lower, however, that an FSIQ was not calculated.  Because of how uneven the results were, giftedness was not suggested.  This is not at all in line with the position adopted by the NAGC.  Even if the FSIQ had been outside the gifted range, the 60+ point difference between index scores should have suggested that the VCI was a better measure of my potential.  Not to mention that it's generally regarded as a better measure of intelligence than nonverbal ability is.  I later scored 148 on a nonverbal test, which in conjunction with my emotional state when being tested with the WISC may indicate the PRI as a severe underestimate.  The psychologist already noted Comprehension as a likely underestimate.

""Great,"" you say, ""isn't it nice to be so advanced?""  No, it's not.  Especially since I didn't know the other half of why all this shit kept happening to me.  I'm still paranoid from the experience.  I worry that my future employers will gain access to my school records through underhanded means, or that all of my online data has already been sold to college admissions offices for a pittance.  I fear that my few ""friends"" are laughing at my social gaffes behind my back.  I occasionally speculate about political intrigue, and by always asking who stands to gain inevitably end up within the realm of conspiracy theories.  I've cogitated on issues of social structure, free will, morality, and the future.  I always come up with the same answers: that free will cannot exist under societal constraints, that morality is entirely relative, and that humans will ineluctably destroy themselves and the world through rapacity and ignorance.  I am profoundly disappointed, both on a personal level and on an impersonal one, with our species.

I've occasionally seen psychological profiles like the one sketched out above, and that's what really scares me.  Alienation, depression, early social trauma, attachment to animals, paranoia, perceived lack of recognition, ASD-like symptoms, eventual academic advancement after repeated denial leading to a questioning of self, and stratospheric verbal abilities all seem to be associated with two main eventualities, especially in white males.  One of these is my dream.  The other is my nightmare.

My worry isn't eased by the fact that I used to be endlessly amused by pyrotechnics.  When I was about 10, I piddled around with manganese heptoxide, thermite, and some mixtures of my own devising.

I want to be a professor.  I have a passion, a goal, and even the outline of a plan to get there.  But if I were to slip up along the way, if I were to not get into a good college, if I were to never land a research position...  I don't know what I would do.",07Aug2019,1

Also, if I ask him to buy me Gatorade or something, he will say yes just to make me happy and then not do it at all. Whenever he eats my food, he does not replace it. Remember I work full time, so I buy my own food. He either works on his “hobbies” (building a house for 31 fucking years &amp; forcing my mother to be his assistant because god forbid a woman be smarter than him), or literally sitting on the couch with eyes glazed over.

24,"Hi, I am 17 (female) and im worried i may have an early sign of schizophrenia. I get these mind loops where my inner voice (the voice you hear in your head when you think) will repeat something over and over, getting louder each time to the point it sounds like yelling. It only lasts for about 10-40 seconds but in that time there’s nothing I can do to stop it. I try thinking about other things but my inner voice won’t break away from the loop. I get this nostalgic feeling that is very uncomfortable and while this happens I usually space out for the time being. If I try to go on with whatever I was previously doing, it will only get louder so i usually just sit there and wait it out. It makes me feel like I’m going crazy because I can’t control it!!! I’ve been having these “loops” every since I can remember, but not often. I got them more when I was younger but on average maybe only once a year now. I’ve told my mom about it and she said “oh I get that too, it’s just overthinking”. But it’s not overthinking. I know the difference. And it’s not repeating my thoughts, like OCD can cause. Even though it’s the voice in my head, it’s uncontrollable. I cant stop it while happening, or recreate it/make it happen on demand. It’s like something takes over my inner voice and I can’t control what it says/how loud it gets. It’s like a spiral, starting quiet but usually ending in a loud yelling voice. The voice is fast paced and always repeats the word(s) (usually only 1-2 words max). It’s not the typical schizo “hearing voices in my head” type of thing. It’s never a conversation, and I don’t physically hear it with my ears as some schizophrenia patients do, but rather quite literally in my head. It’s the inner voice you hear while reading a book or thinking about something, not an actual physically audible one. It’s one of the most unsettling feelings ever. I don’t know what to call it other than a “mind loop”. It may just be classified as repetitive thoughts but I’m not sure. If anyone has experienced this or knows what it is please help!!

30," Way back when I was eleven I finally started to wonder ""What happens after a person dies?"" now I was raised in a religious family and even though  I am still pretty religious myself right now sometimes I don't even know myself what I believe in the point is that back then I was 100% sure that there was heaven but then the more I thought about heaven I began to think that once I died I would be in heaven for eternity and that the days would pass on and then the years but I would still be in heaven now this scared me a lot to the extent that when my family took me out to see an action movie and every time a background character died I got so scared to the extent of almost crying. 

I ended up talking to my mom about it but she just said ""Oh, well heaven is nice so nothing to worry about"" this answer didn't make me feel better since I thought she was missing the point but as the days went on I managed to suppress this idea to the point  in which it didn't affect me anymore and I could live life without worrying.

Now months ago this fear came back but this time it was worse since I had to think about the fact that none of us really know what happens when you die and that there is a chance that there really isn't anything in the other side, this terrified me, I had constant nightmares in which I was about to die with  uncertainty of what would happen after, I started studying a bunch of religions/non-religions  and started focusing on the cons of every single one of them and I didn't know who to talk to about it, my  parents might get angry over me questioning my religion, my friends can't help, no one I trust could, and like the last time I had to suppress these feelings.

And we come back to today where these ideas have come back but worse. Now I am going, to be honest at this point in life I feel very healthy with myself so I don't really worry about dying anymore since I have managed to convince myself that I just have to enjoy life and that I have many things to look forward to in the future and that I have nothing to fear about death but very recently I had a nightmare in which my parents had passed away and this has given me an all-time fear, I can't leave the house without feeling stressed for my parents, I feel like I'm the only one who can do something to help them, I feel like everything I do can lead to problems for them, I feel like I'm responsible for anything that could happen to them, I feel like if I  think too much these thoughts will become a reality and It will all be my fault. Apart of me knows 100% that they will live full healthy lives but that part of me is getting overshadowed, I hate not being able to enjoy a day because I worry about what will happen to them if I eat at the wrong time or leave the house to early, I hate it that every night I think about what will happen tomorrow, I'm living everyday like its everyone that I know's last. Every time that I try to enjoy myself with some alone time there is that part of me who thinks spend more time with your family. I have probably told them 'I love you' a billion times last week. My friend is saying that he doesn't see a point in life anymore and that really scares me because I know that anything could happen to him and that I had a chance to stop it but I'm not 100% sure if he really means it because I've seen him laugh and smile at dumb jokes more than anything. I really need someone to talk to, but I don't know who I can really trust with this information so I just came here. I'm really sorry for the horrible pacing but this has been really eating me up from the inside and I needed to get it off my chest, I don't know what to do at this point so any suggestions would be nice since answers are really what I have been needing right now. Thanks.",07Aug2019,1

32,"This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons. Well, I am a 27 year old male who has had a long history of panic disorder with OCD. I used to have severe panic attacks multiple times per day which made me not want to eat (Panic attacks were from a food phobia) so I was always skinny (120 pounds 6 foot 3). 

When I was 15 my parents allowed me to meet a therapist who gave me celxa 20mg for panic disorder and it helped, but then when I entered my 20s something changed. I started having panic attacks again, as well as intrusive thoughts as I walked around college imagining how easy it would be to kill them with a gun. The type of homicidal ideations have always been associated with guns and mass murder. Even though the medicine I was taking now was not working I decided I was fine. When I was around 23 my thoughts started to become an obsession to where I would read books about mass killing/ watch documentary about Columbine and even constructed and exploded a homemade explosive. But then with the stress of these thoughts I started to self harm.

I was self harming and cutting my self with razor blades, and even had to go to hospital to fix a wound. So I decided I needed help and spent a month at a mental hospital and got medicine. They never really told me what I have but while I was there I was so angry and had thoughts about abusing the women. I never did any of it, but the thoughts were there. But anyways, they put me on 25mg Lexapro 500mg Depakote and 100mg Seroquel. 

The thoughts after that stay went away for a year, but about 3 months ago they came back and they  keep coming into my mind. I do have access to fire arms but the reason I would not do it, is not because of the guilt or the sadness of the people that would be dead, it would be the jail time that I would have to spend. I don't really want to waste my life in prison. I have a good life, a good career and wouldn't throw it away even though I have held a loaded gun to my head a few times this month. Idk my thoughts are really mixed right now and Depakote makes it hard to formulate complex thoughts. I really don't know what to do, I have not seen my therapist in 8 months because I moved away but last time I talked like this they put me in a mental hospital against my will and I can't afford to do that right now with my dream job on the line. Any advice on what I should do??",07Aug2019,2

34,"I’ve sort of been sitting on this post for a while, working myself up to actually posting it. I really wanted to get this out to SOMEONE, but oddly enough I am not wholly comfortable unloading this stuff on my friends. So here we go.

My dad’s side of the family has a history of mental health issues, mostly anxiety but some depression here and there. I assumed I lucked out because into early adulthood I didn’t exhibit any symptoms.

Unfortunately, around summer 2017 I started experiencing these bouts of pure dread. Just absolute hopelessness about any issue I don’t have immediate control over. I had issues dealing with this at first and my relationships with my friends and partner suffered because of it. 

By the time I got into college, the issues worsened. I was having trouble getting out of bed, I was isolating myself instead of making new friends, and I was just miserable. Couple that with the split with my girlfriend of roughly two years, who had always been a source of stability and support, and I was coming apart at the seams. Towards the start of winter, I basically wanted to die and couldn’t stop thinking about how much I’d like to quietly cease existing. Luckily, right as it hit the fan (around November) I started seeing a therapist. Immediately, he suggested I get put on an SSRI and I had a prescription within a few weeks. 

Gradually, I started improving. Still have bouts of negative feelings every now and then, and typically they’re much more bearable. I got out of my shell and made some great friends who have helped me through it all. I have been working hard to stop ruminating on my mistakes or blaming myself (which I’m still working on).

I have a lot of trouble talking about this with my friends, however. I think part of it was I was very private about my emotions for a long time, and that may have resulted in issues communicating my feelings. 

I think the other part is imposter syndrome, or something like that. I remember rejecting the idea of seeing a therapist for over a year because I was convinced nothing was wrong, that my behavior was normal and that treating it as a mental health issue was melodramatic. And then when I started therapy, I hoped to get a diagnosis so I could feel clinically validated. That never happened, the closest was when my PCP speculated (but did not confirm) I may suffer from depression. So I can’t shake the feeling that maybe I’m overreacting or faking it somehow.

But despite all of that, I am doing better. I’m not completely rid of feelings of hopelessness or self destructive desires, but they’re more sparse and easier to deal with.

I’m grateful for my new friends. I miss the girl I was dating a whole lot, but I don’t blame her for not wanting to carry my baggage and for looking for someone who was more stable. On the bright side, being single has been way less stressful and I find myself worrying about my personal relationships less. I’m looking forward to starting from scratch with someone who will know me as the better-adjusted person I’ve become rather than the emotional mess I was a year ago. But you know what? Even if that doesn’t happen, I feel like I’m in a good place.

Here’s to a new school year. Let’s hope the upward trend continues.",07Aug2019,2
35,"I'm not sure if I'll end up posting this or not. I feel like I need to just let it out because I have nobody in my life that I feel like I can confide in. Life started to look up for a little while. I met an amazing guy after getting out of a terrible relationship, I've moved out of my abusive father's home and I'm so close to finishing nursing school. I should feel like my life is starting to fall into place but it's not. I've spent every night the past week on the couch, like I am right now, staring at a wall or a sticker on the water bottle that's been sitting on my table for the past month because I haven't had the energy to do anything let alone to clean. I've been working as much as I can because I feel like it's the only thing that takes my mind off of everything for a little while but I'm starting to burn myself out really quick. Is the flow of this making sense? Probably not considering I'm just typing out the first thing that comes to my head. Anyway, I'm particularly upset tonight because I feel like my boyfriend is distancing himself from me. But I don't know if that's true or if it's just my mind playing tricks on me again. I'm too afraid to ask because I'm scared it'll push him further away. His ex-girlfriend had a lot of mental health issues as well and from what I can gather she pushed all of her problems onto him and eventually exhausted him. I'm terrified that if I say I'm not okay that I'm going to push him further away. I love him so much and he's been what feels like the only good part of my life so far. Losing him would kill me. He's just too important to me. When I finally left my ex-boyfriend he said, ""I hope that the next person you date hurts you so bad it destroys you like you're doing to me. "" Those words haunt me everyday because although I knew I did what was best for myself by getting out of that abusive relationship, I still feel like he's right and I deserve it. I'm so alone with all of these thoughts I don't know what to do anymore. Not sure really what I'm looking for in response to this really. Am I completely crazy and overreacting?",07Aug2019,1

37,"My best friend’s parents are driving him crazy. Parents have dementia and extreme paranoia and have made his life hell for years now.

I’m begging for some suggestions. I’ve told him to reach out to the older siblings and for them to take them in or send them to a Assisted Living Facility or pay for home health aids and for my bro to leave. He’s been on antidepressants and benzo for years now and their siblings solution have been to increase his dosage and deal with parents. He’s told me so many suicidal things over the years and I’ve done everything I could to help.

38,"a bit more background info: I'm 17/f and in a better place now, but my family is still homophobic as hell and I suffer from the aftermath of being there at an impressionable age. ALL the shit you hear from Fundamentalist Christians was taught to me and they still feel like ""instinct"" to me. Indoctrination just does that to you. BTW I've got Aspergers and Anxiety, so that shit makes me obsessive in a way.

I wasn't able to write enough but it's like during middle school, a good ton of my depression developed because I wasn't able to enjoy myself like the other girls. most of my energy went into the mask I was trying to fit into. I've been told that I'm an abomination and that I'm unnatural and going to hell by everyone in my life at that point.

The memories of being outed still haunt me and I still walk around feeling like someone's looking over my shoulder. In a relationship with a girl, I hardly feel comfortable around her unless we're alone and even IF we're alone I feel like I'm hardly safe.

I left Christianity long ago which was freeing but I still suffer from the paranoia. I feel like I'm on edge a lot and that there's something I'm ""running"" from so to speak.

I have a hard time being honest with ANYONE. I also developed a good chunk of my Irritable Bowel Syndrome at that time and it's probably going to be there for the rest of my life.

I am now a Quaker who believes in a loving God who accepts all people, regardless of sexual orientation or gender, but I still can't get the hateful god out of my heart and head. I was an atheist but I found Quakerism to be more fulfilling.

40,"Not sure if this is the right sub, but I (17M) have pretty poor emotional empathy. My cognitive empathy is just fine; I can put myself in other peoples’ shoes and be able to speculate logically how they’re feeling and how I’m to react. But my emotional empathy - being able to feel others’ pain so-to-speak - is lacking. Because I’m always navigating emotional things with a sort of basis of logic rather than emotion, I mess up pretty frequently. For example, I often have a hard time understand when it’s best to stop talking about a difficult subject, or knowing what’s appropriate to talk about. If there’s a tragedy in the news, I want to say all the details I learned about it, forgetting sometimes that it’s ok to leave some of them out if it’s upsetting the person I’m talking to. I’m also lousy at comforting people beyond basic etiquette.

I had a not-so-great time growing up, to which I can probably attribute at least some of these issues. I know that abuse/neglect typically causes victims to become sort of “natural caregivers” and value others’ wellbeing over their own, but I feel like it’s made me more concerned about self-preservation, which makes me feel sort of guilty. One of my family members was also mentally unstable at times so I learned to be very quiet and unobstructive if someone’s crying, to the point where I get a lot of anxiety when I’m around someone who’s upset because I don’t want them to lash out at me. 

My first memory of this sort of thing was when I was around four and I was at a birthday party where a little girl got hurt and the other kids were saying, “I feel so bad for her,” and I genuinely didn’t know what that meant. I’ve been to over a dozen funerals in my life and have never mourned. I know that grief can manifest itself in many different ways, but I honestly don’t believe I’ve ever grieved. I especially have a hard time relating to when something - usually the death of a child - is in the news, and people say things like, “I can’t watch anymore, it’s making me sick.” I come off as calloused in situations like that because I can only fake an emotional response to a certain point, you know?

Bottom line, I want to be able to feel other people’s pain more naturally. I’m afraid I’m going to end up an asshole. I already don’t want kids because I don’t have it in me to completely selflessly provide for another human, and no kid should have to go through having a father who doesn’t have their best interests in mind at all times. But what if one day I have to, for instance, care for an ill family member, and cognitive empathy won’t be enough to subsist on? I don’t want them to feel like a burden because of my own shortcoming.",07Aug2019,6
41,"Hi guys,
So this is going to be a bit long but I really need some help wording this all out to my doctor and landlord. 

So, I struggle with anxiety pretty bad. I was always wary of medication but last summer it had gotten so bad that I needed to talk to my doctor. I was dissociating while driving and then getting home and crying, or convincing myself I had some disease and staying up until morning freaking out. I was put on Zoloft but struggled maintaining the routine/remembering to take it while at school and eventually just stopped. My anxiety got really bad again and on top of this I was in an abusive (physical and emotional) relationship. I ended up looking into emotional support animals and just taking it upon myself to buy a cat since my apartment was pet friendly and I was honestly fine with paying the fees. I ended up calling my doctor a month later to see if she would write me a note for esa since my friend told me to at least try. She did write me the note (it was just a quick note stating that I needed the cat to help with anxiety) and my apartment accepted it. 

Fast forward, my cat helped me preform better with school as she helped me develop more of a routine, and also tremendously helped with my codependent tendencies and I ended up finally getting out of my relationship with my ex. I really depended on my cat to bring me back to reality in times of panic or if I was feeling like breaking down. One thing that helps when I experience dissociation is to feel something physical and holding her and focusing on breathing helps me out. After I got out of my codependent relationship, I was a wreck. I was drinking so much every weekend and I ended up completely lashing out at all my roommates because I was so emotionally unwell. I told them, drunkenly, that I hated them all and that they were terrible friends to me. I will admit they were bad friends lol but after that happened I genuinely had no one. My roommates would not even look at me for the rest of my stay there and I ended up moving out early. I didn’t eat for a week, had one meal, didn’t eat more than a snack for the following week. I see a counselor and she and my parents wanted me to go to a hospital. Anyways, as sad/dumb as this is my cat truly was all I had during this time. I was suicidal and in a really bad state for a few months. I grew a huge attachment to her, but I also had to find myself a new living situation. I asked some girls I didn’t know well if they’d live with me and they ended up saying yes. I didn’t want to live alone and isolate myself so we all signed a lease at a townhome that has a no pet policy. I figured I’d be able to hand them the note I had, but they sent me a 10 page legal document that had to be filled out by a professional explaining why the cat helps me function in daily life/what purpose she serves. 

I have an appointment with my doctor to discuss this in 2 days, but I’m not sure how to word all this to her. These new girls are best friends and I’m an extra and I will be staying in the basement. As someone who really does struggle coping with loneliness and who has bad anxiety, I am so scared that I will ruin this with them or feel too left out or something. I really feel that having my cat there would benefit my ability to stay more stable during the year. I’m so attached to her at this point and I really don’t know how I will be able to handle leaving her at home.

If anyone could help me form this into words, or help me with what I should tell my doctor in two days I’d really appreciate it. I’m nervous and scared that all of this isn’t significant enough to keep her or have those papers filled out but truly she has benefited me so much. 

I would also like to mention Schizophrenia runs in my family and part of my anxiety is that I’m going to get it soon (I’m around the age where it starts to show). I grew up watching it effect my sister and since then I have always had a fear of that happening. I’m scared living with people I don’t know well if I do end up having some sort of episode they won’t understand and I’ll be completely isolated again. 

If you read all of this I really truly appreciate you sooo much. Just need some advice :) sorry if this sounds like all my problems clumped into one but I had to get everything out. Thanks",07Aug2019,2

43,"I was unofficially diagnosed with depression last summer by my therapist. I had been going through several years of various trauma, and I did not piece together that what I was struggling with was depression.

Unfortunately, I’ve hit a bump in the road mentally, and it’s one that’s barking at me to find some additional help. When I see my therapist this week, I’m going to ask about antidepressants because I feel they are somewhat necessary to help me get through a very large stain on my day-to-day.

I was diagnosed with severe PPP/PPA a few weeks ago. I did the bare minimum taking care of my new baby and didn’t take care of myself at all. My husband couldn’t be bothered to look up from his phone long enough to notice so I didn’t tell him I was on the verge of just running away and getting the hell out because I wasn’t a good mom. I felt like I was failing. I am isolated and baby is colicky and I’m so tired because heaven forbid my husband do any of the nighttime feedings. I have panic attacks constantly. I’m on medication and had my doses upped because of all of this and am in therapy, but once I again I’m sitting in the dark unable to sleep and no one gives a shit about me. Nobody gives a shit because now I’m just baby’s mom, not a human being. I try to feel better, but I know when I’m at work (part time and I need to work for our finances) my husband sits on his ass on his phone and does the bare minimum. When I’m home, heaven forbid I ask for help. And I need it so badly. I’m so tired and am sitting on my couch staring at my front door realizing I could just walk out and leave because no one would care if I did. It would just be inconvenient. I just at a loss and feel like absolute shit. On top of all of this my eating disorder (for which I’d been in recovery for 6 years) has reappeared. I can’t bring myself to eat. I don’t want to because I can control that. I can’t control anything else but I can control what I eat and I don’t want to eat anything. I’m not breastfeeding so it doesn’t even matter. I just feel like I’m losing it and really needed to vent because I’m alone and no one gives a fuck about me. My doctor was the first person to ask me how I was doing and mean me, not my son and it killed me inside to realize that. 

I may just walk out that door and just keep walking.

I’ve always been a big dreamer, and today I casually and rhetorically asked aloud about what I could to work in a few of my different dream jobs. It was only in the spirit of the moment and not very serious, but I also firmly believe that you cant accomplish anything that you don’t dream/believe you can accomplish. So, I always keep my biggest aspirations in mind and will throw them around in casual conversation as I see fit to ensure that even if they are unlikely, they’re still possible. Either way, my parents, in the most serious way possible, told me stop dreaming big and start dreaming realistic. I said “you’ll never accomplish anything that you don’t first see yourself accomplishing” and they told me it’s a waste of time to falsely believe I could ever accomplish those dreams. For what it’s worth, those dreams included writing successful books, serving as a writer for a variety of my favorite shows, and finding a line of work where everything I do makes others happy.

How do I do this? This might not be the best sub for this question. So point the right way of so. 

But like give me so advise please. My family is smart. Sister is straight As. Not street smart but eager to learn. She says she doesn't look forward to school but never says she hates it. Brother is very smart but never applied himself. You can tell just by talking to him. He understands the world around him very easily and can navigate it with easy. mother got masters and is basically a doctor knowledge to match. Father only got bachelor but is an engineering genius. 

I on the other hand hates school. B C student who hates school. I am the only person in family who cant do something for hours on end. Hour or 2 is absolute max before I have to do something else. I have ADHD and it shows despite me being 21 years old. I have shit self control. I smoke, drink, mindlessly browse internet, and love to work out. I Put that last on because it is the only think I can do well. If you leave the gym tires and fatigued then you succeeded. Only thing I do well. The worst part is I am very introverted so I am not even one of those fun idiots who goes partying and such. I do my best to be nice to people and be a good friend because that is all I have. But while I am stupid I am very opinionated and often argue with people. Witch makes people not like me much. Fortunately I am an introvert so that doesn't bother me much it makes those that do stick around actually good friends. Even if I sometimes think they are out to get me. Something that gets me is that fact that I love classical music and art. These are connected with smart people and I love them. I couldn't tell you who I like or what peice I like cause I cant remember what they are. But I have multiple playlists of what I like and regularly listen to them. They're just considered high clace intellectual thing and it those me of. Just to show I ain't as smart as I seem.

My grandmother is not the most intelligent but is very extroverted and loves it to. When i am sober i cant much stand her but when i am drunk she is everything i love. i say after 8 beers. I need to wrap this up.

You can say, hey but don't do it, you still have a lot to live for, but that's the problem. Life is pointless, there is no purpose there, anything matters, why should I bother. It has no sense.

I'm just so unmotivated, I don't want to kill myself, but if a magician wanted to make me stop existing I wouldn't really fight him. I would try a bit, and then that's it. I stop existing. 

I don't really want to go to a psicologist because I see there's no point in doing that. My goal in life is to have a pet, I don't really know if I'll have it but eh, I don't really care that much anymore.

As reads in the title, I have severe Persistent Depressive Disorder. This is the result of abuse of every kind as far back as I can remember by my biological parents. The main effect of this, as well as the driving cause of my condition, is a crippling lack of self worth.

Basically, everything and anything I do means nothing to me and it never will. Because these ideas we're so deeply engrained into me for such a long time, I cannot percieve it being any other way.

But that's okay.
Here's how I can accept that I mean nothing, but still find happiness and fulfillment in my life in a healthy way:

[I am constantly learning how to describe this better, so understand that I may not have this at its most accurate]

Starting with the assumption that there is 0 worth to myself, a very good first question is where to start building. 

To make it a bit easier to digest, I'll use a black hole as an analogy. A black hole is more or less a very dense chunk of matter floating through space. Imagine my self worth is a black hole. You cannot see black holes, so for the longest time we did not know they existed, and the harder you look for one, the less you'll find. We know black holes exist because of their effects of surrounding bodies, this is the core of my belief and the idea that has improved my life 100-fold.

I judge the value of myself through my effects on others.

The most common first response to this is usually something like ""you can't live life trying to make others happy, put yourself first"" this is a very valuable piece of advice, but relies on the assumption that I try to please others. My standpoint is used entirely reflectively in nature, so this argument breaks down.

 Let me elaborate: When I'm in those moments of a heightened sense of depression, I look back on any point in my life and the changes in others around me. I find things like: ""That little compliment I gave someone made them smile"" or ""Giving that little bit of extra help at work seemed to mean a lot to my co-worker"" and if I assign those actions to a strawman, I could not rightly say they were a bad person, in fact, I would say they were a great person to be around. And because of that, by extension I cannot say that I am not a great person and someone like that is pretty valuable. 

All my life, I have had doctors and friends telling me not to accept the lack of self-worth, that it would cause me to get worse and lead me to bad places. (And for a time, it looked like it was) But I had found that in reality, the cause was me fighting myself over one thing which my everything was built off of and another which my everything knew was right. Now that I've accepted that feeling and learned to work around it instead of fighting it, I've turned my life around and am yet to look back since. 

TL:DR: I accept my depression instead of fighting it and built a new, unique perspective on life around that, and can lead a happy and healthy life as a result.
Really though this is a very nuianced point and even this essay of a post doesn't give the clearest, fullest picture.

57,"This is more of a rant because I have no one to talk to in real life, let alone at 1 am.

I haven’t been able to get a proper night sleep in months now. I’m always tossing and turning for hours or wake up with super bad headaches.

I’m so stressed thinking about how I will afford college despite working damn near full time at a part time job, my parents can’t/won’t help because of their poor financial decisions, and I need a laptop. I can’t get a good amount of scholarships because my parents make too much on paper but in reality we barely make enough to get by. On top of that I’m going into a career others have been working since the womb for.

I am working so hard at work but feel like I get overlooked for good opportunities and get worked too hard for what I make. 

I feel so alone and after four years of high school I made no close friendships, let alone relationships, and I feel so behind in the social aspect of life. 

My depression keeps telling me to give up because I’m a failure and waste of space and it just gets harder and harder to even do anything.",07Aug2019,5
58,"So as the title suggests, I have tried ( All available therapies, multiple times, multiple sessions, multiple people)  And anywhere in-between. No dramatization, no bad period in my life to speak of that has not always been there. Just a realiziation, that realistically there is no actual help for me. ...I'm bipolar, have severe PTSD, GAD, Insomnia, Depersonalization disorder, Derealization disorder and a severe form of separation anxiety going back to since i was a young kid. (kindergarten) Very rough upbringing, and have felt completely defeated too many times to count-but this time it's very different. All are exhausted. Literally. This is not a ""this too shall pass"" or ""hang in there"" scenario, it's all done. I will be 29 this 11 of December. That's all i can muster up to say right now.

But i don't have the strength to type anymore. But my instinct tells me i have to give this a shit at least. Ask anything, unless it's related to the things that I've already tried and done. Questions regarding anything else about me is open.",07Aug2019,2
59,"I have no idea how to say what I want to say, but I will try. I'm taking a risk by posting this anywhere, but I don't know what else to do. 

My friend and I have been close for several years now. We dated back at the beginning and ended up coming out as really good friends who wanted to live separate lives romantically. I've known her closely and I never stop learning more about her. But for almost all of the four years I've known her closely, I've known about her sever anxiety and depression. 

I may not be the best at being supportive, but I do try. She's very secretive of her personal issues (which is why I said this had risk by posting), and her parents do know about these issues, but not to the same degree that I do. She confides in me more than her parents or her therapist. She has told me that for years she has tried so hard to hide her issues from people and make herself out to be perfect (which is unfortunately a biproduct of how she was raised). Of these people she now tries to hide the truth from, her therapist is one. Partly because she is afraid of how her therapist would react of she told her the truth. I will return to the point of her therapist later.

To give insight to how bad her anxiety and depression has become, I will explain a few events of the past year. She, last fall had begun her first semester of her freshman year at University. She has looked forward to this her entire life. Her anxiety has followed her socially since before the age of 8. Unfortunately, she was misdiagnosed by a shitty psychologist at that time as simply being defiant. This made her parents because more physically punishing. This only caused scarring and more issues later on. They are loving parents, but horribly misguided. She's 19 now. And during her first semester of college she got sick. The illness was amplified by her anxiety which prevented her from leaving her dorm. She missed classes, and anxiety also prevents her from making social connections as she believes she can't fit in anywhere. Even though college was supposed to be different. She had hoped. 

She managed to pass all classes with a 4.0 but she still believes she is worthless. The illness involved surgery which ultimately did not help, but recovery mixed with anxiety forced her to withdraw from the spring semester. This was another huge blow. All the while, she has to watch me come around and be supportive, insisting that I am happy to do so, while I'm also taking classes and doing the thing she believes she ""failed"" to do. Now we are gearing up for the fall semester again and she has another dorm. But she broke down (as she has often in the past from all of this) and told be she can't do it and insisted against everything I said that she couldn't do it and that she doesn't know what to do of she ""fails"" again.

I know her parents (who have changed and want to support her) would understand, but she really believes she can't tell them anything. I tell her to talk to her therapist about it and she says it's pointless because she wouldn't have anything useful for these issues. I tell her the truth I have which is that she is worth a lot, a lot to me, and that she can do this so long as she doesn't give in to defeat now. But, like many times in the past, my words fall on deaf ears that refuse to believe anything else than the truth she has built up for herself. 

I really, really care about my friend. Admittedly, a lot more than I should. But, I don't think she would benefit from knowing that if she doesn't already. I'm afraid to ask people for guidance because I feel they will tell me I need to take care of myself. But, I can't abandon my friend. She has gotten to the point where she dreads time that I'm not with her and depression consumes her more easily. I know I'm being supportive by being here with her, but I'm scared. And sometimes I feel myself slipping down a dark path for myself and my relationship with her. 

This post was largely a vent that I guess I needed. But I really want to help my friend. If anyone knows anything or has any advice for me, please tell me. I want hope for her, I what her to have hope. Given that she is secretive and wouldn't want me posting something like this (which I feel makes me a terrible friend and confidante) I won't be able to direct her here. But, I can try to implement any advice. As for me and my fatigue, I will gladly listen to anything except any notion of abandoning her or distancing myself.

Thank you.

60,"I have had a very interesting path since my marriage breakdown, remembering all the trauma I've been through. I had time alone for a while but it did not bring me much joy. I met some new people who supported me about a year and a half ago but I have successfully pushed them all away. I have had a lot of trouble being vulnerable with people. According to family I am coping well and they believe my current feelings are situational but I cant help but feel that there is something wrong with me that stops me from building healthy relationships
 I have a psychiatry appointment soon but I have been on fire the last week, finding it very difficult to function but still pushing through.
Someone who said she loved me for 6 months recently instantly formed a new connection after making a last ditch attempt at forming a formal relationship with me. I was close with her and the most vulnerable I've been for years with her. Her behaviour instantly caused me to spiral, even though my unwillingness to commit which was circumstantial was obviously at fault. I think I just expected different behaviour despite it being I guess healthy?


I'm stuck caring for her but trying to be alone without support and it has been the most difficult thing I've faced from what I remember.

Is it healthy to be this alone? I feel like it should bring about an epiphany or something but at the same time I feel it might come from an unhealthy place where I think that nobody deserves to be affected by me, my moods and my situations and circumstances, and feel like I have been feeling this way for years. I feel like this might be situational or a sign of rejection sensitive dysphoria- other things make me think that as well I guess I'll figure that out with the psychiatrist.

Cheers to anyone who made it to the bottom of this rant. 

For those who didn't a tl;dr discussion point would be is it healthy to be completely alone or is it human to have a support network for talking about the day to day problems we all face.",07Aug2019,10

68,"So the past 365 days has been an absolute roller coaster. I’m 25 and this 365 day period began when my Girlfriend of six years and I broke up. It wasn’t the toughest break up in itself though it did involve cheating, the hardest part has been getting used to being single and feeling like I’m still learning how to be an adult properly. We were 18 when we got together and moved in pretty quick so iv never really spent much of my life on my own.

In the time since I’ve had many ups and downs, the ups being some of the best times of my life. After about six months I fell in love with a German girl who was in my country travelling, we had an amazing whirlwind romance but eventually reality came to remind us that things that good can’t last forever and she had to return home. (Health issues and Study). While that was on the whole a beautiful experience the fallout and emptiness of it still lingers. Especially since we still talk.

Over the past couple of months my life has been different, I can’t even say I feel an overwhelming sadness like I had always imagined depression, it’s more of just a feeling of ‘what’s the point’. I oversleep and struggle to get out of bed in the morning, I overeat, I enjoy the thought of dying but I don’t want to kill myself.

Everyone around me would think there is nothing wrong, I’m a very positive person, always making jokes and I’m known as being a funny person to be around. In these moments around others I would seem happy and I am, but  lately happiness for me only lasts in brief fleeting moments.

Yesterday I decided it’s time to do something about it, so I went to the doctor with the intention of arranging therapy sessions. He did a assessment and put me on SSRI’s and therapy. But I was surprised he considered it that bad because as I’ve said, this isn’t exactly what I imagined depression to feel like, it feels more like laziness. Does anyone else feel this?

I don’t really know what I want from this but can some people tell me their opinions on meds? Also what helps you and how long until you started feeling better? (If you’ve been through depression) And does this go away at all to the point where I won’t need therapy and meds?

You DO have choices. They may not be favorable. They may not be advisable. But in the end, YOU are the one who is in treatment, not an illness. You have EVERY RIGHT to ask questions of your therapist and be open about your progress. You should be in a place where you feel comfortable to ask those questions--what's your therapy style? What's our goal? MOST IMPORTANTLY: What will this drug/exercise/therapy style do for me? What is its function? If you as a client don't know what and why you are taking something, you are not taking full advantage of your power as a client, consumer, and human being.

Notice how I said client, not patient. Client speaks more to the fact that it is a mutual decision to be in treatment that is negotiated between the two parties. 

I'm not endorsing going against medical advise. I endorse knowing how that advice fits into your life. When a psychiatrist wanted to put me on a third medication to treat symptoms of the first two, I said no, and I stuck with it.  We tried another medication altogether. I don't regret it. Now I'm abroad, and a therapist advised me to see a psychiatrist. If I was in a less stable condition, yes I would.  I insisted, no. There are GPs around, and I've been on the same medication for 10 months. I know what's best for myself, where I can find support, and how to get support when I need more of it. I don't need to pull anymore money from my wallet because a professional highly recommended a psychiatrist.

It's take to take charge by making choices that are informed by professionals AND your own life experiences, wants, and needs.

77,"I don't know where to start... i'm sorry, this may be a long one, I'me really lost right now and I don't know what to do, and I feel like I need to explain how I got there...

&amp;#x200B;

Tomorrow I will turn 22. For the past eight years, I've been struggling with low self esteem, and what I recently got diagnostized as mild depression. I was bullied in school because I was the quiet smart guy type, then became the weird guy nobody talks to. Thinking back, I had no character, I was simply a smart child. I had a friend that I met on an online game. I considered him my best friend. I also had a ""girlfriend"" (we were 12 so nothing extraordinary happened). One day I introduced them to each other as they were two important persons in my life. After maybe a week, she left me for him. I felt anger, sadness, I felt that life wasn't fair, that I should trust nobody because anybody can betray me. Since then I just started to blame myself for letting this happen. I spent the rest of middle school alone, because those I though were my friends were actually her friends.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was in high school, I met wonderful people that became my friends. Some of them are now my best friends. We would play for hours, laugh, talk about anything. They made me forget about my sadness, about my anger, about everything. But when I was alone I still felt empty.

&amp;#x200B;

After I had my diploma, I started to study IT. I kinda linked IT, but I mostly did it to follow my friends. I still felt empty, but knowing I would see them everyday was enough to make me happy. But years passed, and most of them are now at the other side of the contry, in great universities. I'm still studying in my hometown because I'm too lazy or too scared to move that far from home.

&amp;#x200B;

So for years, when I woke up in the morning, my first though was ""I hope I get hit by a car today, so that I finally stop existing.."". Too depressed to enjoy life, but at the same time too cowordly to end it myself.

&amp;#x200B;

For the last two years, I've tried to meet new people. i've joined a pen and paper role playing game club at my universities, and have met great people I still play with regularly. One of them, let's call him Bob, invited me to dm at a party at his girlfriend's house earlier this year. I was not sure what would happen, but I guess I just went with it to see. It was great. I had so much fun. It was not the blasting-music-drinking-all-night-long kind of party, it was more of a chill party, where we play, speak, laugh and have a good time together. I loved it.

&amp;#x200B;

Some days after, Bob's girlfriend (let's call her Jess) messaged me on discord to talk about how I was cool and she wanted to invite me for the next time. I was thrilled. Having someone tell me that my presence was liked. That made me so happy...

&amp;#x200B;

Over the few months following this, she invited me to all sorts of events, parties, and it was frankly the best months of my life. I felt like I had friends, but real friends, not online friends. We were talking a lot, and I really mean a lot. She was cute, intelligent, our conversations always were meaninful. But, at one point it happened, and I fell in love with jess. I was devastated because I felt like I was betraying Bob by having these feelings. I hated myself, but after some days trying to hide these, I had to tell her, I was getting exhausted. I knew she wouldn't be mad. She conforted me, telling me it was not my fault, it happens. She was actually happy I told her and that I didn't just held them for me.

&amp;#x200B;

So for months I stayed in love with her, and things were smooth. We talked even more, I would tell her how much she meant to me, and she would confort me when I felt down. She helped me open to some of my friends about my emotions, because we never talked about that between ourselves. She made me feel hope about my life. At one point she even kissed me, to try, hoping she would dislike it, because she was catching feelings for me. But she told me she loved Bob and would not leave him. And that even if she left him, nothing would happen between us two. I was really sad, but went along, because I loved her, I loved spending time with her.

&amp;#x200B;

Last month, she invited me to spend some days with her and Bob when they were camping. I was so happy. It was actually the best holidays I've ever had. that is until... I made a huge mistake... I can't exactly tell what happened, but it was big enough so that she really hesitated to break of all ties. I was devastated. She was hurt. After a week, we talked about it. She told me she forgave me, but at the same time could never forget what I did. Now, she is unconfortable being with just me. And I can understand that. And I hate myself for that.

&amp;#x200B;

So here I am. I feel like I have lost everything. I don't know what to do. I still love her, she means so much to me, but at the same time I know nothing will ever be the same with her. But still, for my birthday party (that I did last week to have as much friends home as I could), she spoke to all of them so that they could group and buy me a ps4. I had mixed feelings... I was so happy because I wanted one and they all participated.. But at the same time I feel like I didn't deserve it. I am a burden. The only thing I do is hurt people. Is hurt my friends. I hate myself for everything I have done to her, because I've hurt her profondly, yet she still went on her way to make me happy. I feel like the biggest douchebag on earth. I shouldn't be alive, I shouldn't have these people as friends. I know they like me and they want to see me happy. But I can't. I feel like I made them waste their money and time. For the past week, I have been alternating between sadness, indifference, anger against myself, several time an hour. I feel like I will explode if I continue like that...

&amp;#x200B;

Several months ago, I went to see my doctor to talk about my depression and got diagnostized with mild depression. He gave me anti-depressants, and a paper to give to a psychologist I should see. But I never took them. And I never went there. I feel like if I go there, I will waste his time, and take someone else place, someone that could really need it, more than me. I'm not worthy enough...

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do now. I don't know if I should just let time flows, see how things goes. I still love her, but I know I can't continue like that, because it will lead nowhere. I hate myself for crying like that over the internet...",07Aug2019,1

83,"Hey, I’m writing this because I really don’t know a way out anymore.
Today I’ve hit the breaking point, my suicidal thoughts have been here the whole day and they won’t go away. The feeling of loneliness, the feeling of giving up is so strong right now.
When my ex left me everything went downhill really fast. I broke down. She was the reason I got out of bed every day. Now I’m just laying in bed, not knowing what to do. I’m also dealing with PTSD and I’m getting help but it’s just not working. I’m getting new medicine but idk how much longer I can take this pain. Yesterday night I was ready to overdose on any medicine I could find, I didn’t overdose but I just don’t see a way out anymore. When you wake up every day with the strong feeling of loneliness because the love of your life left you is just so horrible, when you wake up every day with this anxious feeling and the feeling of helplessness is just breaking you and I just can’t cope with it anymore. Every day I wake up I feel scared, I feel lonely, I feel like giving up. And not only because of the lonely feeling but also because of my PTSD. I thought my life got better. But then she left me and everything went downhill so fast. It’s not her fault but I just feel so lonely now. And that feeling of loneliness is eating me right now and the stress and anxious feeling and panic of my PTSD is getting worse too, it’s just all too much. I can’t even properly do my job anymore because of the panic I get. It already feels like I’m dead from inside, because I’m not living anymore, I’m trying to survive. But I feel like giving up right now, I really did everything I could to find happiness again. I’m gonna lose my job, the thoughts and feelings that come with my PTSD are getting stronger. The feeling of loneliness because the love of my life left me is just breaking me right now.
And if my family ever sees this and I did die of suicide, I’m sorry, but I can’t take this pain anymore.",07Aug2019,2
84,"Tl;dr: I just skimmed through my own words and realised this is just barely coherent rambling so probably don’t read it haha I think I’m just venting anyway

I’m 19, my name is Dan, I live in the UK and I’m increasingly starting to believe that there’s something seriously wrong with my brain. I’ve not felt even the tiniest bit of happiness in the last 6 months, just varying levels of anxiety and sadness and numbness. Days pass days pass days until it’s been a week until it’s been a month until it’s been half a year. My girlfriend broke up with me 4 months ago, we were together since I was 14 and I loved her, somewhere along the way she stopped feeling the same way and then she was gone. I pushed on and adopted some healthy habits, I go for a run at least every other day, I keep an eye on what I eat. But even so, there’s nothing that brings me joy. I have 1 friend in the whole world and it takes him days at a time to read if I’ve messaged him just saying hey how are ya. 
My mind taints everything I see and do, I got myself a cute little hamster and I love him to pieces yet I spend half my time with him worrying about the fact that he’s only got a short life and I’ll be so upset when he’s gone. I don’t sleep well anymore, I just toss and turn and bite my nails and think about how blue I feel and how it’s not going away. Just a relentless ticking in my back of my mind saying “this is an awful feeling, this is an awful feeling” so some nights I only sleep an hour or two or not sleep at all. I’m on day 2 right now. 

Over the summer I got a job, hoped it would be a good stabilising thing for me, instead I got a horrible boss that worked me like a mule and took advantage of the fact I was doing an apprenticeship to pay me 3.90 an hour. Eventually I packed it in because it was killing me and for about a week I was totally lost. What was I going to do? I’m 19, I have very little experience and no friends and no way of making friends. So I decided the best thing I could do was go to university, it seemingly potentially offers everything I want, an opportunity to meet people and make friends, it opens up more career prospects and I get to study something I find interesting for a few years. So I did it, I applied and got in late because of my (accidentally) good grades and I move to a new city at the end of September for the biggest experience of my life. - I should be excited, but I’m not I’m terrified, im second guessing every decision I’ve ever made, I’m not going to make friends in uni, I’m painfully shy. 

I just wish more than anything I could be excited about my future but I’m not, I only see the worry and the bad in everything and I can’t stop myself, this is a great opportunity for me yet my mind subconsciously turns it into something to avoid, it shoots ideas of “well maybe it’s not too late to cancel my enrolment” down my spine because I can never be self assured in anything. The only thing I can do reliably is worry and panic

88,"I went back to work on Monday after over a week of being off due to suicidal thoughts and other psychological phenomena. They let me finish y shift and called me in. Gave me 2 warning papers. One was for ""An absence without adequate notification or a doctors note is subject to be inexcused"" and the other was ""inadequate watering and previously told to throw away anything that was dead and/or not retail quality"" with an attachment of several pictures of dead plants. The weeks before the incident, I made my manager aware of possibly having to go to the hospital for mental treatment and also that the new hours they had given me did not allow me to water everything in the lot on time. They even knew I was going to therapy. I had texts to prove this but before going back to work I decided to clear some space on my phone (deleted 4,000 pictures and messages/voicemails etc). I argued with them that I have 2 doctors notes and left them at home on accident and that I had asked for help with all of the dying plants. The manager just said ""Okay. So you're not going to sign these?"" Of course I wasn't. My sudden absence was an emergency and I did my job as well as I always had. I'm guessing the manager never relayed anything I had said to the owner who was standing there too. The manager never checked my work. I was literally alone in the lot every shift. 

The first day of my absence, my mom became suspicious of the manager collecting photos of plants and asking me about them over text when I was trying to recover from repeated panic attacks. 

Every job I have had before has been nothing but a traumatic memory. I have bills to pay. I need money to pay for therapy. But I am paralyzed with fear of applying to other potential traumas. Things like having ""good people skills"" immediately keeps me from applying to a job. I don't trust myself to do well in any job. Sometimes I blame myself for why I can't find a job that treats me fair. I am afraid that if I take on a job that is too much for me, I will be tormented everyday. I can't do anything right. Not only can I not every completely clean my room or pick up my messes but I also can't get some slack for things I have no control over. 

I had initially had suicidal thoughts because my medications apparently stopped working and I could not think. So I began telling myself that I am defective and nothing will help me be anywhere close to normal. I will never be decent at anything. 

But, I know I have also been repeatedly treated like a helpless piece of shit by my past employers and even my father.

89,"I started suffering from depression and anxiety at thirteen. My mom didn't want me to take any pharmaceuticals until I was out of my teens, but by eighteen, I was on my first medication. 

I've gone through a dozen different drugs, all in the SSRI or SNRI types and they helped but not a ton. My darker mind was always there with me trying to get me to sabotage my life. 

At thirty-three, I took the 23andme DNA test out of curiosity and then ran the results through Promethease and found a note where it mentioned that my genes might be limiting the effectiveness of SSRIs and SNRIs and so I went to my doctor and asked for Wellbutrin or another drug outside of those two classifications and to my surprise Wellbutrin worked better than anything else I had ever tried.

I remember on a drive home from my aunt's, I had a laughing fit because I realized my darker mind was silent. 

Sure, I still have some rough days and I hate taking a drug every day but it really helped me finding something that actually worked for me.

90,"Hi. I'm a dude that was kind of a drama queen in the past. About a year ago I self destructed in marvellous ways (stopped eating, was drunk all the time, problem-bombed a couple of people and I let myself be used by someone else) and this ended up in me alienating all my friends.

Now, I've grown a lot of self awareness and have found a lot of positive coping mechanisms to deal with my illnesses. I'm not normal but I'm a lot better than I was, and continue to try to be better.

However, I can't get over the guilt of my past actions. I understand why I did the things that I did, but I just feel horrible remembering the person I was. It was my birthday recently and some people from the past were kind enough to wish me happy birthday but made it clear they don't want to hear from me further, they were just saying happy birthday. This made me feel hurt. Them not wanting anything to do with the person they knew me as is understandable, but it still hurts a lot and I keep getting flashbacks to my past actions which really messes up my mood, and pretty often too.

93,"This is a judgment that does not only live in the imagination. This is a real sentence said by real people to other real people. It is a sentiment that many of us have heard since we were little children. “You can't just sit at home all day.”  

I was diagnosed with clinical depression and social anxiety when I was thirteen (maybe fourteen but it had been going on for a few years), but this is not about my struggles. This is about my progress. I am now twenty-eight. I'm a stay-at-home, unpublished writer. I am not employed. I have no income. I have no colleagues. I have no manager. I have almost no social life... and I feel great.   


**Context**: I've never had a flourishing social life. I've never lived in one house for more than four years. The longest I've attended one school is 3 years. As a result, I have never had a friendship last much longer. The exception is an old classmate with whom I still have semi-regular contact.   

 I have moved countries four times: the last two times I moved by myself.  I am currently learning my third language (not counting my one year of school French).

 I have worked in a few very different jobs: I've had physically demanding jobs in shops, in parks, and with animals. I've worked in an office with customer support and with clients. I've mentored and trained several people, and I've organized social events for work. I've worked for huge, international, billion dollar companies, and I've worked in small national stores as well as tiny local organizations. I've done volunteer work for the community. I've learned to work and socialize with people from all kinds of backgrounds and with all kinds of interests.  

 I have travelled. I've had port and cataplana in Portugal. I've walked in the French alps, had pizza in Paris and pastries in Adjaccio. I've had Czech beer and pig's foot in Prague. I've biked in the Dutch countryside. I've seen my favourite band in concert in Amsterdam. I've driven 160km/h on the German autobahn. I've bought Berliners from a bakery in Bremen. I've been to the zoo at Cotswold in England. I've sat in jazz bars in Copenhagen. I've crossed the Golden Gate Bridge in San Fransisco and tasted the In-and-Out burger. I've rowed on Swedish lakes and camped in the forest. I've galloped on Connemara ponies over the fields in Ireland. I've lain on Greek beaches. I've swum in the Mediterranean Sea.  

 I've worked my ass off. I've lived frugally. I've paid back my dad for my scant education and for my driver's licence. I've saved up half a year's worth of wages. My lucky break was being made redundant (for the second time) which made up the other half to give me enough to write for a year.   

 I found true love. We are coming up on eight years together and we discussed for a long time that I wanted to write full-time. Eight months ago I gave up the job that was stressing me out and moved to the small city where my partner grew up. My partner has a job that covers our bills and we use our savings for extras.

 I may not have seen it all but I've been out there for many years. I've been pushed far beyond my comfort-zone and I've found my way back. I've found what breaks me and I've found what makes me happy. So I won't listen any more to ""you can't just sit at home"". I've worked for it. I deserve it, and it makes me happy.

97,"Hey everyone, 

I just don't know anyone I feel comfortable talking with about my issues, so I thought I might give this a try. 

Lately I feel totally detached from everything. I can't stand people at all right now. When someone talks to me I find it hard to follow and can't concentrate on what they're saying. My mind constantly wanders somewhere else and I often can't even tell where. Most of the times it's my fantasy as I'm a hobby-writer. I have to make huge mental efforts to even follow the slightest bit what drains way too hard on my energy. Same with talking. Often I simply cannot partake as I cannot find any words to say or have no idea how to react. If I do I can't hold a conversation and only react directly to what was said 

 When I get to a crowded place, I begin to get extremely uneasy and it's all too noisy. It's too much so that I actually fail to actively notice stuff or people. It's like I'm living behind a veil. I don't leave the house without headphones at all simply to not having to hear all the noise. Being at work up to three times a week is already too much (home-office rest of the time) so I make an effort to visit the gym or stores when I think they're empty or not too crowded.

I'm also completely unphased by almost everything. Previously when my boyfriend and me would fight it would always leave me in an emotional state. Right now I don't feel anything at all when we fight. Same with my parents so it's not just that my relationship has come to an end. He is actually the only one I can spend time with without being annoyed right now. The thing is I'm not generally that numb. Seeing my bf doing well at work gives me joy, watching my cats play too, making mistakes at work makes me sad. It's all there, except direct social interactions - I'm just kinda unresponsive emotionally and verbally.

While I've always been the loner-type who didn't have or want close friends, I feel freakish right now. I used to be okay with being social to a certain degree but right now I'm 100% asocial and I don't really *feel* like I'm missing out even though I *know* I do. I don't know how to properly describe this state but I kinda had to get that off my chest before my appointment with a therapist in approx two months (insane wait times are bitches).

105,"Hi all, my name is Raashi and I am a mental health advocate from India. I lost my little brother to suicide on 6th January this year and it hasn't been easy. What's worse is that I didn't even get to say goodbye and I still don't know what happened. I have now dedicated all my time and energy towards this cause. I have launched a petition asking the government of my country to launch a national helpline number for suicide prevention. There is so much stigma still. I aim to start a conversation and want our government to address this issue on a national platform so that people know that they are not alone. I'm here. I'm fighting for us.

107,"I've been going through a 'Dark Night of the Soul' for the last few weeks and need some advice. Currently seeing TWO therapists; One seems to be somewhat helpful but the other we mostly just discuss the philosophical implications of all that I'm going through, which I am interested in but doesn't help much day to day. 

I've struggled with Anxiety and a tendency towards OCD for going on ten years but recently my mother passed away and that mixed with a tumultuous relationship has triggered Depression, OCD and probably other stuff that I'm trying to uncover.

It seems as if my mind is coming up with new ways every day to pull me into an endless stream of fear, suicidal ideation, paranoia and depression. 

I had a bad LSD trip many years ago that created in me a profound sense of Derealization, specifically around a girl I was seeing at the time. Everything she did seemed fake and preprogrammed and this has since followed with other relationships I've had with women. I think there is a common theme here as it seems to be like I am pulling away subconsciously. Also after my trip I dealt with a lot of OCD and constantly researching feeling like I was losing my mind. Finding lots of coincidences (Synchronicity) in the real world also contributed to the derealization and sense that everything is unreal or preprogrammed. 

Fast forward to now and I have been having a lot of suicidal ideation mixed with Pure O OCD, constantly researching wondering if I am actually suicidal or not. I've come to terms with it and am trying to accept the thoughts so spend less time researching that subject but the urge is always there despite it causing me anxiety at times and not wanting to die. However I am also very depressed and anything that once brought me pleasure it seems like there is a chemical reaction in my brain that instead of feeling happy or hopeful I feel hopeless. For instance just thinking about food (While normally would probably give me a brief small dopamine kick) makes me feel hopeless and overwhelmed. Everything about my life as it is now I feel depressed about. My home, my pets, my relationship, my future. 

I think part of this all stems from always wanting more. I am in a long term relationship that I have always had one foot out the door despite on paper my GF being perfect in every way. It's like I can never just be happy with what I've got. I've always wanted a perfect fairy tale life and as different life stages pass by and I grow older, lose a parent, become involved in a serious long term relationship, it all seems to leave me wanting more. I had a Porn addiction that I am working on that has destroyed her and her trust and has caused increased friction in the relationship. For her this is something to work through but I know that if I continue to string her along I am committing to her and I fear that for some reason and it was now translated to that sense of derealization around her. Feeling like everything is predestined and I don't have any agency. Like even after I broke her trust she still wants to be with me. That's something she of course has to deal with and I understand her and am trying to be there for her but it is tough during this time.

Yesterday after a meditation practice I went into full blown anxiety and had a horrible night filled with a profound sense of dread and suicidal impulses. I sensed that everything she said was preprogrammed or something and seemed unreal. 

I am wondering if any of this might also have to do with some type of spiritual awakening. I am agnostic about everything however I do 'believe' in spirituality and think it may have it's benefits. I am reading the Power of Now in order to try and practice mindfulness and being in the present seeing as how my mind is on full blown attack mode. Could this have anything to do with some type of Ego Dissolution or should I just leave all that alone now considering my feeble psyche? Am I nearing a psychotic break? Is this all just a very creative anxious mind creating all sorts of fears and illusions? 

I feel a profound sense that I need to change everything now. That I need to make big decisions or something in order to escape the clutches of this anxiety. I also of course have fears about suicide. I get overwhelmed by all of the self help out there and all the things I should be doing to get better; Meditation, Exercise, Healthy Eating, Reading Self Help, etc. I know the obvious answer there is to just chill out and accept the moment as it is however I have this profound sense like I mentioned that I need to fix myself and change. Which obviously I do because this state of mind really isn't sustainable. 

I am not taking any medication as when I did in the past I first started having suicidal ideation so I would like to not go that route again. Trying different things like Ashwaganda, 5-HTP, exercise, etc., but all that feels like it merely masks something because ultimately I've got deeper stuff going on that I need to fix and work out. 

Any advice or insight is appreciated.",07Aug2019,1
108,"Hi! 

So I was working and I had a meeting in 2 minutes and my boss, who is also a friend, asked me to post something to facebook before the meeting. I rushed it, didn't tag the post accordingly, proceeded to delete it and then he became very angry, started shouting and acting aggressively. After that we talked, he apologized for overreacting and I apologized for my mistake. But I now feel like I'm seeing a lot of disrespect in his behavior toward me and I'm anxious when I see and interact with him.

I know I tend to be oversensitive about things but this is making me want to quit working for him. I don't know how to act on this feeling, if it's justified or if it's just me not being able to handle life? Any advices?

115,"

In 2017, I went to college and there I was diagnosed with GAD. I got medication for it and took it for a while and it didn’t seem to help. Upped the dosage, not any better, plus it made me feel weird so I stopped taking it around a year after starting it. 

For around a year now, I have been off the medicine and using marijuana to help control my anxiety and it works perfectly fine when I’m at my college town and under normal circumstances. 

The thing is my family is very over stimulating and anxiety driving so when I go home (which is only once or twice a month) I am way more stressed (and not smoking because my family is super against weed and if they found out I used it I would be dead). The issue is, my mom keeps suggesting I up my dosage and wants me to go back to the same doctor I’ve been seeing. I want to go to a different doctor because she knows my current doctor and I’m afraid she’ll tell my mother if I inform the doctor I am not taking my medicine and self-medicating.

119,"You're probably wondering about the title so let me start from the begining. 
I was born with a shy and anti-social personality but I am natrually very gifted. I only had a few friends. These friends were my world and I was a bit overprotective with them (Like one time I hit a girl with my toy bag because she was insulting my friend). Well when we went to school some friends moved away while my ""BFF"" ignored me and never even said hi. I may have been born smart but my internal organ were sorta weak so I was in a lot of pain when exercising (I broke my finger at 10 and was completly calm and simply walked to the teacher and told her. Even the doctors were suprised because they thought It didn't hurt and wasn't serious because I was so calm)

Everyone in my class except one skinny boy (One of my trusted friends today) made fun of me and isolated me because I was chubby not even oveweight. So I started going to training even though I frequently hyper-ventilated or felt vey pained.

I was emotionally broken because of the abuse and my parents the only adults I ever trusted only said ""Adapt"" I tried to commit suicide at around 7-8 but couldn't do it. 

No one believed I tried or comforted me.

The people at training started to isolate me again so I was all alone. And I finally gained friends by pretending to be  ""perfect"": kind, hardworking, athletic, talkative and  charismatic. That is of course on the surface.

My ""BFF"" told every little secret to everyone and played the victim card, my ""friends"" always gossip about everyone and my family went from neglectful to abusive.

My mom went from ""I don't care"" to physically and vocaly abusive and my father was always emotionally manipulative.

I started seeing what people felt or wanted with me from their expressions and started trusting people in general less and less.

I don't trust anyone, I don't love anyone, I'm simply what people want me to be.

I don't think I have a real personality anymore and a lot of adults ( All the teachers in the school love me, adults that came to talk about different themes to school...) say I'm very mature and have an interesting outlook on life.

120,"This is gonna be quite a long post, so hold onto your britches.  


And if we're being honest, I'm not even sure this has much of a direction anyway, I just desperately need to vent somewhere to someone..  


I don't know how else to describe my current predicament without describing my past; I was the victim of abuse for around 15 years of my life. My step-father (we'll call him John) is a narcissist and my mother was too deep in her own woes and despairs to protect my brother, sister, and I from any of his manipulation and violence. It started with my brother, John made sure that his life was the epitome of misery. After my brother being sent to a plethora of group homes, foster homes, boys homes, and juvenile detention halls, he was allowed to escape our miserable existence at the ripe age of 14 and lived out the rest of his teenage-hood with my grandparents. My grandparents never understood what was so wrong with him, mostly because there wasn't anything wrong with him but John was a stellar liar and made sure that all of the police, Sheriff's, and social workers involved believed that my brother was a demon.   
I was 7 at the time and I had felt like the only person that had loved me had been sent away. My sister resented me because my brother bonded with me more and she made is obvious every single day how much she wished I didn't exist. You see, my sister has mental issues of her own, namely her learning disorder. As I grew up, her hatred of me grew simply because I could get smarter but no matter how hard she had tried.. she couldn't. After my brother left, I guess John needed a new victim.. he needed to feel powerful and my sister didn't make the cut. She was too good at pleasing him, always cooking for him and doing little errands. Throughout all of this my mother was absent- but not physically. She would sit on her laptop all day and pretend the world around her didn't exist. The moment she would emerge herself back in reality, John beat her down. Literally. I remember him breaking a window and stabbing her with a piece of glass in the leg when I was around 5. 

Everything started fairly slowly for me; years 7-9 I was uncomfortable but not *very* miserable. I wasn't allowed to have friends over, go over to a friend's house, or have friends at all.. My school life was watched very closely by John, I think he was afraid I would tell someone but I was too fear-stricken for all of that. I used a clear backpack so that he could easily see the contents of my bag, my bedroom door was taken off of it's hinge, and I wasn't allowed to be upstairs in my bedroom unless I was asleep. I had to be under John's watchful gaze always. It wasn't until I was 11 that real changes had been made in my life. The moment I joined middle-school, John's already mean disposition turned diabolical overnight. He started treating me the same way he had treated my brother... I didn't know how to rationalize it other than ""he is treating me this way because he thinks I will start acting like the stereotypical teen"". I couldn't understand why he started treating me this way; I was the top of my class, always getting straight A's without any encourage from home, I read at least 6 books a week- I was a powerhouse for knowledge and I absorbed everything like a sponge. From a distance, my life looked great! Then again, no one my age was quite allowed to get a closer look into my life anyway. 

My life was like this until I was 16. I was pulled out of school at 12 and placed into homeschooling. I was promised it would be great, that I could advance much faster and study what I wanted to study whenever I wanted to study it. At first I remained optimistic but soon realized it was just another ploy to distance me from society. My grades fell and I learned to ***hate*** school. I never had a break from the constant burning eyes of John on my back. From dawn to dusk, My every action was controlled. I was given an old computer to do my schoolwork on in accompaniment with my workbooks, but my internet access was very restricted- he watched me all morning. I had never had a phone or a tablet, and John kept it that way. He cut off all of my access to the outside world. I was surrounded by his own propaganda.. he hated Hispanic people and black people alike, I was taught that Muslim's were evil people and that I should never befriend one. It also didn't help that we were taught to believe that the end of the world was going to be any day now and we better repent for our horrible sins! 

Every day I lived in fear: I feared living, I feared him waking up, I feared him hurting me, I even feared him waking me up at 3 AM to drag me out of bed, beat me, and have me clean (which happened often). That was something also prevalent in my life at that time: the beatings. By 13, my depression and anxiety were *so* pronounced that they had physically manifested health conditions such as scoliosis, arthritis, and fibromyalgia. John thought I was a hypochondriac even though the doctors and my medical records say differently, but he used this to his advantage. He would have me huddled on the floor, kicking me in the back and he did this often. If I didn't fulfill his every whim as fast as he wanted, I was hurt for it. One time he even got so angry that he took a loaded gun and pointed it at me, chasing me through the house. I was so terrified I hid behind my sister and wept. 

I wasn't allowed to enjoy any of my life, John would have me sit in the dark kitchen and stare at a wall while him, my sister, and my mother would play video games and watch tv. I was told that even watching them be happy was too much joy for me. At one point he smashed my school laptop because I didn't close it down fast enough, even though the power off screen was up. He took it to the kitchen floor, threw it, and smashed it with a hammer. And you guessed it, videos where parents shot their kids technology gave him great joy and I'm sure they were a source of inspiration to him. This would go on for hours a day after my schoolwork. At the end of the day, if he felt like it, I had to sleep in the living room on the floor so he could supervise me. There was also times he would wake me early in the morning just to have me throw away everything in my room such as toys, cute clothes, and anything that wasn't the 3 outfits he permitted me.

It wasn't until I was 16 that it all was finally put to an end. John had developed this dream- that we would move to the middle of nowhere and *we would make it*!! You know, Little House on the Prairie style. We lost the townhome we had lived in and we packed up our belongings. We were so poor we had to rely on John's friends for a solid year. John finally collected and liquified our assets into $6000 and purchased 5 acres and a small R.V. We moved there with no plumbing, electricity, and no money for food. We gardened, built an outhouse out of wood from the woods and multiple huge tarps and a garden hose. I was so malnourished I went from a healthy 140 lbs to 115 in the span of 1 summer. But you see, John didn't lack any of the luxuries of life; he had rigged something from the car battery that allowed him to charge his laptop and had his own personal hotspot. He would watch tv shows while we worked.

One day, that laptop fried. When that laptop fried, all hell broke loose. An enormous argument ensued between my mother and John.. it ended up with him taking our only vehicle and everything we owned along with my sister. I remember sitting outside as John and my mother argued over who would take me. Neither of them wanted me.. John hated me, and my mom wanted to be free! To live the teenage life again, free of responsibility and my 16 year old self was a huge hamper on those plans. Finally, my mother allowed me to stay with her.. and my grandparents, the one and the same that rescued my brother, drove 500 miles to come and get us the very next day.

My grandparents treated me well, even if my mother didn't. My grandmother made sure I was fed 3 meals a day, I was given plenty of clothes, and *I was allowed to paint my nails and do makeup*. I started feeling like a human being for once. My brother, then 24, got wind that I had been rescued from the clutches of John. He quit his nice job in D.C., left his home, and came back just for me. A frail and terrified girl, I entered that place as, but with the help of my brother I emerged a strong woman. He helped me enter this world and prepared me for my first job. I admit, it took years to overcome the mental boundaries John had set, in some ways, I still haven't..  


**Flash to a few years in the future**

Depression and anxiety have always been apart of me, I've learned to live with it even though I shouldn't have to. My past has given me a fear of counselors and seeing what they did for my brother. I live with it..

I guess what the summation of this huge rambling is... I feel like I am back where I started.

I have a husband and as humor would have it, he's black (I would love to see John's reaction to that). We have a gorgeous toddler and even though he has his fits I wouldn't trade him for anything in this world. We have a cute puppy that I gifted my husband for father's day, a home, jobs, blah blah blah.. The American Dream, right?

Tell me how I still feel empty.. My husband has grown tired of how broken I am that it annoys him. It annoys him that I can't go into a store by myself because I feel like I'm drowning when I'm by myself. It annoys him that I can't walk into our leasing office and demand to see management by myself. Things like this have put a hamper in our marriage.. I would even say.. that it has caused his anger issues to relapse. The same yelling John would do, my husband has began. There isn't the same amount of fear, but.. it hurts me. It hurts and I fear that the man I love will turn into the man that tried to ruin me. I feel like the burdens I carry with me is destroying something I hold dearly more than anything.. I want to save my marriage.. I want this to work.. I want to stop being the broken little girl that feared the dark not because of monsters but because John might show up and drag her out of bed... I want to feel like I'm actually worth something, and not the deformed creature I see in the mirror...

I want peace..",07Aug2019,1
121,"So in the past, I’ve been officially diagnosed with depression and anxiety and my therapist has suggested heavily ADD. I also suffer from symptoms of ROCD though i have never been diagnosed.

Now, I’m in a relationship. It’s been a year and a half now, and we’ve been living together for 4 months. We moved to a new city and I’ve yet to make any friends, so most of our free time has been spent together. We’ve definitely had hard times- the beginning (first 6 months) i was constantly obsessing over if he loved me or if he truly cared about me. Once i became more secure, i started to OBSESS over my feelings. I researched for hours on end only to realize love is a choice and feelings come and ago. After that, things were great between us and i felt this strong connection and felt very loved. The butterflies were never really there, but he was my BEST friend and i trusted him with my life.

Once we moved in together, things got hard: long story short, he had shut down for a while and we had to work on communication. We had a huge fight where he almost left, but we worked through it and on paper, things are great. He’s communicating well, developing hobbies, trying to make friends, and I’m trying on all those things as well.

But i have lost that lovey feeling as well as the best friend feeling. I love him and still want to make things work because he’s such a great man, funny, caring, hard working, and we connect well. But i spent a weekend without him and felt great. Coming back these last couple weeks, it’s been hard. I feel a bit suffocated when he’s around, and i just enjoy my alone time more than i used to. I really have been OBSESSING over this change and I’m terrified it means we shouldn’t be together. I just don’t feel like he’s the person i want to hang out with most in this world, and i have no idea why. I’m not sure if it’s because we spent so much time together for over a year or if it’s something to do with my mental health or if it’s just the wrong relationship.

126,"I have a significant fear of getting testicular cancer that started about a year and a half ago. At first it started with just being diligent about checking my testicles for lumps and bumps. Over this 18 month period, it has started to inhibit my life. I spend upwards of 20 to 40 minutes (possibly an hour on a bad day) over the course of the day, checking my testicles repeatedly for lumps. I am fully aware that a check every few weeks is sufficient and that when I find nothing, nothing is wrong with me.

However, because I can't see inside the scrotum, I doubt my perceptions. I ask myself if I \*really\* can be sure that there was nothing there (maybe I missed something?) or that the angle I was feeling at wasn't good enough, or that one more check will help assuage my fears. If I attempt to simply stop, I become uneasy and feel like I need to check some more. It takes a lot of effort and patience with myself to walk away from it and get on with my daily life. I am the point lately where my testes feel sore from time to time and are probably irritated by the checking.

I am never going to be a big streamer and work a full time job but i do always want to give back so this just felt great to me. Im thinking about doing it every day around 6:00 just so i can help others (: either way just wanted to share that it was such a positive experience and really helped make some people’s days brighters",07Aug2019,3

129,"Probably since I went through puberty I've had ups and downs with depression and anxiety, and for a long time I would just hide it. I have always been very silly, outgoing and friendly with the people around me, and so when I finally opened up the response was mainly around disbelief, ""you're not depressed you're the happiest person I know"". 

I pretty much played by the rule of ""fake it till you make it"" but I just never made it. I got so good at appearing to be happy around my friends that even when I thought I was happy I couldn't tell if it was real or not. 

I've never been suicidal, and I try to be an optimist, but I seem to be quite apathetic about things. I enjoy being alive but I just don't enjoy my life, and I don't know how to change this. I've tried exercising, eating healthy, taking a class, going out to events... And yet nothing seems to change this overarching feeling of dissatisfaction.  

I've tried moving to a new city, throwing myself into my job or a relationship, learning a new language, and yet through all of this I always have this feeling of being stuck. Of not being happy with my situation and not knowing how to change it or what kind of change would really satisfy me. It's as if I'm searching for something and yet I don't know what. 

I keep hearing people say to just deal with it and not everyone you have a relationship with is perfect, or most people don't like their job, or you're thinking too much about it. I think to myself okay then, but do I really want to live the rest of my life feeling dissatisfied about everything? 

I keep trying to think of what I can do to make myself feel happy and enjoy life. What dream job do I want and how do I get it. What are the situations that I would enjoy... And yet even with this I can't seem to really pin things down. Do I really want to go back to school? Would I really enjoy living in another country? And honestly I am doing these somersaults in my head just resulting in me staying the same or making a change that doesn't really result in any type of mood change. Maybe it's just a bandaid solution that seems to come off in a couple months. 

A part of me feels ridiculous writing this out, especially since in many ways I live a privileged life, and there's no really reason why I should be feeling the way I do, and yet I do.

Anyways I just wanted a place to vent and see if anyone else has had similar situations in their lives and how they have dealt with it.",07Aug2019,2

133,"So my therapist and I have been talking about child-work as an effective form of therapy for me. Positive self-talk and self-care are the hardest things for me and I don't feel comfortable with them. Maybe because I don't feel its important or more likely that I don't have myself as a priority. I have researched child-work a few times but there's something keeping me from getting started. I can only remember a handful of memories as a child but it's ever more rare that I remember what was going through my head at those stressful times. I think I struggle with the same internal things I did as a child, today. Sense of identity, purpose, confidence, feeling included, self-importance, feeling capable, reaching goals, etc. So I guess what I'm confused about is how to ""give my inner child"" these sensations when the current me still struggles with the same things. Where do I start? I can only remember struggling to be average. Being scolded for showing symptoms of my ADHD, not being physically fit, having weird interests, and not being able to relate to my fellow classmates. Where do I start?  I remember trying to be a tough girl and do tomboy things and make boys scared of me. A lot of my issues today were caused by having an emotionally neglectful and disciplinary father and a disabled mother. I assume my traumas were caused by the high concentration of stress during my grade school years. How do I confront these events? I don't even feel emotionally connected to my childhood self. How do I achieve this connection? I have a hard time accepting that these events were really traumatic and that I am just weak. Obviously the emotional aspect of my development was neglected, but doesn't my inner-child just need to get over it? I am incapable of showing myself love.",07Aug2019,3
134,"quick disclaimer-sorry for my english, it isn’t my first language.. also sorry if im posting this into a wrong subreddit but i thought it would fit here best

so as the title suggests im kind of worried that there might be something wrong with me but im not really sure, maybe im just  over exaggerating. lately (past few months, maybe even a year) i’ve been feeling really empty. i cant show my emotions, i cant cry when im sad, i cant show that im happy when something good happens (if happens). it slowly builds up in me and when ‘the cup is full’ im just over sensitive and i cant control my emotions for few hours, i usually take a nap and then i’ll be ok. i tend to get angry and annoyed quick but i must hide it, otherwise id get myself into unwanted situations or id yell at my friends, but it’s just not worth it idk. i cant empathize with other people, i suck at being a good friend, people think im emotionless and mean.. sometimes im unintentionally rude to my ‘friends’ because i always think that it’s not gonna hurt them, then im like ‘sorry i didnt mean it like that’.. i started to care less or almost not care at all about anything. i stopped with all my hobbies because they weren’t making me happy anymore, i got bored. well im always bored at home in bed scrolling through internet doing nothing. it’s summer holiday for me and i havent done anything adventurous yet. and i dont think i will. my parents are divorced and i dont have that kind of friends that would reach out to me and invite me to do things. even if they asked me to join i would most probably decline anyways. i dont want to be the third (fifth?) wheel as alway. i’ve been that shy, quiet, weird kid in the class. no one really cares about me except few people. and i think im losing the connection to them as well. 
i know all of this might sound so stupid to some of you. im just a teen, i should be enjoying my life at its fullest, but im not really feeling it that way. i dont even know what im expecting from this. am i normal and everyone goes through this once in their lifetime or have i turned myself into total useless piece of a human.?",07Aug2019,1
135,"TRIGGER WARNING! 
I always had social anxiety and a certain paranoia and fear that people will leave or betray me.
This year did nothing but make it much much worse. I had a run in with a nice guy who after I rejected him went to complain to my so called friends and I lost 5 friends in one go. One even called me telling me I was selfish. 
Then when I thought it was finally over, I was betrayed by my twin brother and a common female friend. But before I knew of what they were doing behind my back, I realised something was wrong and was desperately trying to make it up to them, thinking I had done something to deserve to be treated like that. 
It broke me. I always thought of my twin brother as my best friend. Sure, we had our rough spots and we would bicker from time to time, but that's normal. Worse thing was, while I was taking less time with my friends (and losing them) in order to try and see what was wrong with him (thought he might be depressed), he was happily crap talking me. 
After that, my family fell apart. I was supposed to be strong since I was seemingly the one who was keeping it together the best (but I was just unable to express it). So when my parents asked me, with whom I would go in case of a divorce and they expected me to take a side or when my mom asked me to forgive my brother, I didn't complain and just continued acting the same. 
The only place I could drop the facade was at college and my last friend clearly noticed that something was wrong. She chose to avoid me.
I started isolating myself. I went from going out regularly to being almost a shut in and went from a job where I had to interact with people to a job where on a good day I meet maybe 2 people. 
At this point I don't even know how to express myself, so I just don't. 
At the same time I feel empty and messed up. I go from extreme apathy to sobbing my eyes out when no one is around. I have stopped talking to people almost entirely, just keeping the charade up around my family. 
And I don't know if I am a shitty person who deserves this or if this is all my fault, but I am just so lost. On many days I feel like it would be best ending it all and like there is no point to what I am doing anymore. 
I just want to leave this damned country and just go and go until I am far enough from everyone I know. 
But at the same time I don't want to hurt families family or worry them either. 
If anyone has read this far through my rant, thank you kind stranger",07Aug2019,0
136,"Let's start with the beginning.

Ever since I was small, I was (and still am) a sensitive person. All my social interactions were pretty fucked up up to this point. 

Up until 4th grade, i was fairly isolated, not really going anywhere during breaks, speaking to only 2 people and being bullied. 

I found myself around 11 years old watching porn (sometimes), but gore mostly. I was literally, sometimes close to vomiting, forcing myself to watch all of those disgusting images and videos of people dying etc. because i thought that by having a tolerance to those things made me not a target for others. i also listened to rock music for the same reason.

Then, i became the freak girl. i can recall bringing some knives when i was outside just to scare people or throwing knives after my best friend because i was just ""playing"". i started crying myself to sleep because nobody was hanging out with me.
i was sabotaging myself without knowing.

2016-2017 were very bad years for me.
i was having panic attacks on the regular to the point where my parents thought i had a heart condition.
i started immersing myself into more porn because it was the only source that gave me some sort of happiness, like i was high all the time.

i met this group online that was interested in content  with a lot of gore and sexual themes (which i found appealing at the time) and it went all downhill. i lied about my age, and i offered everything to them: my time; my health: my attention; my drawing skills which they profited from ( i was promised 100£, i wasn't doing financially great then).i started drinking, having insomnia, wanting to die most of the time; i lied about a suicide attempt just to get their attention. then, after the 4th attempt at telling my parents that something's wrong with me, we went to the psychologist. 

the psychologist told me that if i wouldn't open up more and talk to my parents more, i would be put in a mental institution and that scared me; what would others that knew me think? i didn't fully open up to him.
my dad concluded that i just didn't have enough friends and refused to go the psychologist sessions with me.

i was prescribed adhd pills (i don't know why) from which i gained a lot of weight, and because i had my hair very short, it wasnt helping with my self esteem that much.

those experiences have left me deeply scarred, and the stress of the exam that i had to take this year mentally and physically drained me. i have currently a boyfriend, but i'm uncomfortable doing anything close to make-out sessiona just because they remind me of those bad times.

 i rarely feel real excitement, happiness or pleasure. i emotionally feel like a robot that is struggling to learn about emotions; it feels much easier to feel sad or feel nothing most of the time, and disappointment became a everyday thing 

 i am afraid that i am a psychopath. even a depressed one. sorry for the long post. can somebody help me figure it out?",07Aug2019,1

138,"Hi reddit, 

I wanted to share my opinion on mental health facilities. A few years ago, I was practically forced to one because I tried to kill myself. I know they do that for the safety of yourself and others, but I felt like I was being arrested. I had to get into the back of a cop car and had no choice. When at the facility, I felt as though I was a prisoner. For obvious reasons you aren’t allowed your phone, but as some of you know you also have to wear the patient clothing they give you. I see this as a problem because it’s almost as if they are enforcing the stigma that looms on individuals with mental health issues. I felt as though I was a stereotype. I was also forced to take off all jewelry, and fought to keep a religious bracelet on because it was extremely important to me. My mom gave it to me and it always made me feel safe. I felt as though I was being stripped of my identity and beliefs. It’s almost as if they put everyone in the facility under one single category, even though the issues range from suicidal to psychopathic and delusional. I was spending the night there and in the morning they injected me with some sort of medication but i didn’t know what it was. The only food they gave me for a 12 hour hold were some crackers. When I was discharged, I was diagnosed with “adjustment disorder” (backstory: I was admitted because I suffered abuse a few months ago and was having a hard time dealing.) but to keep me there for that long against my will, and diagnose me with that? I don’t know. You may not agree with me but I certainly felt completely powerless and it honestly made me feel more depressed. I felt as though I was the problem and I was being held prisoner.

I haven't been eating the amount of food that I should due to stress and depression and I'm scared I'm harming my baby.

I go through loops and loops of suffering and wishing to maybe just have it end, to being happy that I don't have to worry about it because I ""want"" it and then enjoying something, only to come back and realize I'll lose the feeling. It's hard to enjoy things without thinking about these obsessive thoughts that I'll die, it's pointless, time is passing, I can't even remember it all.

I'm running my department at work for a week both to cover the manager who is on vacation, and as a trial run as part of my own promotion. so work went well yesterday and I felt good. I came home and felt something I hadn't felt in a long time. I felt hopeful. so I took advantage of this moment to write a to-do list for the next day (today), assuming the feeling would last. evidently it didn't and now its 7pm and I have barely left my bed. 
part of my plan for the day was to clean up the apartment while my boyfriend was at work all day. lately my depression has been really bad and I haven't been able to do much around the house. and my boyfriend never complains about that. he picks up the slack and cares for me and never tries to shame me or demand more from me. and for whatever reason that's starting to piss me off. part of me wishes he would be disappointed. but he won't be. he will come home tonight to a mess and a crying girlfriend and it will be exactly what he expected to walk into.

I just wanted to surprise him by doing something nice for him that he wouldn't expect, but I couldnt even do that much. it was a really bad day for me and I can't figure out how to motivate myself and prevent this from continuing to happen every day. I don't understand how I can function perfectly fine at work, but as soon as I am home or I have a day off, I become useless. any attempt to just push past it and force myself to do what I have to do ends with more crying and going back to bed.

151,"Not as dramatic as the title suggests, but I’ve noticed I have two ‘modes’ I switch between, several times a day. However, I’m pretty sure that outwardly, I don’t look or behave differently in each mode. It’s just my point of view that changes. I’ll call them A and B.

In A mode, I’m relatively confident. I’m optimistic. I’m happy. I feel sure I’m just ‘normal’ and there are no real problems to be treated.

In B mode, I’m miserable. I feel hopeless. I hate myself. I feel sure something is very wrong with me. I want that problem fixed.

A and B doesn’t understand each other. They know that each other exist, but both are sure the other is wrong.

Perhaps I should add C mode in which I objectively reflect about A and B and freak out- thinking ‘Have I gone crazy!?’

B mode has driven me to research about a bunch of mental disorders/illnesses/conditions/whatever... Including narcolepsy, depression, bipolar, and ADHD. I’m particularly knowledgeable on narcolepsy and ADHD because I spent so much time searching info about those (through web &amp; books).

I’m beginning to suspect the obsession itself is the real problem to be addressed? I’ve been like that for the past 2 years. Is this a sort of health anxiety...?
