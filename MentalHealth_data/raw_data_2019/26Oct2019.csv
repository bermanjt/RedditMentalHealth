1,"I'm 23, and I've been on a die-hard comparison game with other people for 2 years, no exaggeration. You could probably go through my history (though I have alts here on reddit) and find proof of this. I'm constantly comparing myself to other people. There's one person in particular I'm thinking about because I identify myself quite strongly with her, but it happens with other people too. I'm constantly seeking external validation and all my behavior is guided towards that, so I mimic whoever I think is socially successful, even if I don't find them very interesting myself. So I turned arrogant and insulting only because arrogant and insulting people seemed to be getting attention, for example. And when I still couldn't get results, I would beat myself up. Gradually, I lost all my friends.

Long story short, this caused me to start questioning myself. DAILY. About everything. I've been running this mental pattern for 1.5 years now, and I know that because 1.5 years ago I went into therapy, but it didn't work, and I don't know why. It made it worse, somehow. I lost all my ambition and drive. I used to have pretty big goals, with defined steps of what I needed to learn to get there. And I threw it all away under the quest of becoming more interesting.  Started watching old movies I don't really like watching, started listening to songs I don't like hearing, started watching random facts youtube videos and made a personal ""Today I Learned"" that now has 1500 videos on it and it used to have 2000. Download a bunch of documentaries on topics I don't give two fucks about only because I envy the social success of other people that seem to know a lot about sports, and cars, and whatever random stuff.

THIS IS MADNESS, what the hell?!?! I'm so obsessed. I see a video on my Youtube feed and the first thing I think is ""Would someone else find this interesting if I talked about it?"". I don't know how to stop... I keep forcing myself to watch videos and movies and stuff and I don't know how to stop... I don't know how to prioritize things anymore. And then if I'm doing X I'm thinking about why I should be doing Y instead, so I'm never really doing anything.

Constantly questioning myself and my abilities. I've noticed that my short memory is suffering. Or maybe it isn't and I'm making a whole deal out of nothing. I've noticed that somethings just fail to stick to memory, and the more I try, the more they fail to stick. So I was watching the original Ben-Hur the other day, and the villain's name (Messala) just... didn't stick. Literally every 5 minutes out of those 4 hours I would ask myself what his name was and I couldn't remember it. I could remember Judah's just fine, but Messala didn't stick. A few days ago, me and my friends almost ran over a cute animal and went online to search for his name. It's called ""gineta"" (idk how it's called in English and I'm too tired to search a translation). Again. Didn't stick. All day long I've been tried to get that simple name into my memory. And the more I try, the less it does. Every 30 minutes for the last 12 hours I've asked myself ""What's that animal called again"", and I never get the name right. 

At the same time I can recall all my day in pretty good detail, and remember mostly everything that was said in conversations, I just don't remember the damn animal's name, probably because I get so stressed out when trying to remember it? Idk. So maybe this isn't a cause for concern. But of course now I'm concerned I'm dumb or not as smart as those other socially successful people and that makes me even more stressed and now my head is actually hurting.

I know this is not exactly articulate but whatever man. I'm stressed out. I've been stressed out daily for over 1.5 years now, and God knows how many time before that that I wasn't keeping track of. I'm thinking right now my mental health is at stake and my only solution is to 100% shut down on all fronts and refocus myself purely on my goals and ambitions, at least until I have my life on track or start being happy with where I am, and then maybe I can start devoting more time into those other random topics. I can see I've slowly let myself fall down into an unhealthy obsession and this is the only way I can see to climb out of it. If I find the discipline to see it through. 

If you read everything I appreciate the fuck out of you because I let myself go, so thank you a lot for reading! And hey, any thoughts and advice are welcome :)",26Oct2019,7
2,So for the past few years I have been experiencing on and off phases of severe near crippling anxiety. And I guess this week has been the week. That it decided to start. I have read an article that spoke of antihistamines like Diphenhydramine (Benadryl)  being an efficient short term remedy for anxiety attacks due to its Sedating effects on the body. Should I do this? Usually I take articles as fact but for something like this I decided I should probably get another opinion on that. Thanks all!,26Oct2019,6
3,"Hey guys,

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe the title is a little melodramatic but I do feel like it describes my situation pretty accurately.  I've been fighting with depression, addiction, anxiety and some compulsive thoughts and actions that I can't seem to control.  I've always thought of myself as a bad person but mostly everyone in my life sees me as a great person.  I'm caring, selfless, compassionate, but I'm also addicted to porn and weed, I struggle to keep my mind away from thinking about cheating on my girlfriend (who is the best woman I've ever met, by far), I think about suicide often but I don't like to admit it since those thoughts would disqualify me from joining any branch of the military, which is what I was pursuing for a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

From the outside it looks like I'm making progress but honestly I feel like I haven't changed at all.  If anything I feel worse about myself than before.  I don't know how to deal with my persistent failures and turn them into battles won like so many other people do.  I can't see myself as being a success one day.  I doubt that there's any chance that I'll get out from under this weight.  There's a lot more I could write but I don't feel like laying it all out on the table unless I know I'll have someone to talk to about this.  Is anyone else going through this too?",26Oct2019,1
4,"this is gonna be hard to explain but i'm gonna try as hard as i can to explain it. so basically for the past few days i've been feeling a weird vibe everywhere i go and i feel different. i'll give an example: i usually go home after a long day of school and sit down, watch youtube or listen to music in my room. doing this feels completely different for some reason. there's this weird vibe that i can't quite explain... it's just different than normal. it might be because i've been sick for the past few days, or (this sounds extremely stupid but) my headphones broke and it caused drama between my dad and i (yes it really caused drama). but yea i just don't feel right. anyone know what could be going on??",26Oct2019,2

6,"Hey, 

I’m not sure what I’m going to get from posting this, but I just feel like I have no control nor say in my current situation. I’ve suffered depression in recent years, went on and then off antidepressants, and I feel like it’s creeping back. 

I’ll start by saying that my husband and I have debt. Not 6-figures, but it’s hard to manage while I’m on maternity leave and my husband pays all the bills. Well, he was offered a substantial promotion in a city a province away...and this city is about a quarter of the size of where we currently live. To add to this, I will have no family and no friends in this new city so it’s basically like starting over. Not knowing anyone doesn’t affect my husband; he’s fine as long as he’s working. 

This promotion should only be a few years. If I were to find work in our current city then we’d make more together than moving to this new city. Plus, all the stress that comes with moving is not helping my situation. 

I know my family won’t come visit because they are - in a sense - stuck in their respective homes/cities and they refuse to drive 12+ hours to visit. My friends say they’ll visit, but I don’t really believe it. 

This move is seriously making me upset. I’m really bad at making new friends so I’ve been really anxious. And I’ve been having these thoughts, like if I can’t find work or make any friends then I’d start drinking. While that doesn’t sound bad, I never drink. I drank 13 years ago and it got out of hand so I haven’t wanted to go back to that feeling. But I keep thinking that drinking every day is one of the best options because then I won’t feel so upset about living in a smaller prairie city. And I’ve had thoughts of hurting myself and cutting my wrists; I’d never do that, but I’ve been having more and more thoughts in that direction. 

I am visiting my doctor next week, but are these feelings normal in the depression range or are they more serious? 

I’ve tried to speak to my husband about my feelings but he doesn’t understand. It’s so hard to talk to someone who has never had depression and try to explain what’s going on. 

I’m sorry this is so long, I just had to tell anyone that can somewhat understand what I’m going through.",26Oct2019,1
7,"Everything has been overwhelming and I'm just starting to see how severe my PTSD is since I quit drinking 11 months ago. The last 11 months have been so very rough and long. I feel I finally found stable ground again and now I find out how truly damaged my mind is. But I've been untangling a lot and as I'm working to relieve the excess stress, anxiety and fear and try and uncover my blocked memories with EMDR. Im trying to let go of the root of my trauma and that is very complicated. I feel like I'm opening a can of worms, but for once I feel I'm in a safe environment and I'm making safe and sound decisions and I'm making real progress. I just see the world more panicky  and fearful when my symptoms are bad, which can last days. Just trying to be ok with so much. Let alone my schizoaffective disorder on top of everything else. But so far staying in and alone and reducing any excess stress is working.",26Oct2019,2

9,"When I’m interested in something, I enjoy it and can listen In easily. But if I don’t even have a slight interest I can’t seem to focus on it even when I know that the information is really important (tests and stuff for school). 

I can just about finish the work before the end of the lesson but when it comes to an actual test I write one or sentences then I just can’t think anymore, it’s like a block I think and think and think but nothing comes to me. Or my ideas are too shabby to be good enough for the test so I end up writing half a page while my classmates write about 1.5 pages for a 25 minute task.

I do get 25% extra time in real tests - ones that would effect my A level results anyway.

I’m just wondering if there is anything I can do to prevent this from happening as it is severely affecting my performance in school/homework. 

I have thought of the fact I am just being lazy and don’t want to admit that to myself.

Thoughts/opinions?

Thanks for your time",26Oct2019,1
10,i'm kind of content with the idea of this at this point. nobody else did this to me; i took it into my own hands. no tragic accident caused by someone else... just my own self inflicted pain.,26Oct2019,46
11,"My first ever post, so please be nice-ish? The title really explains it all very simply. Also on phone so sorry if horrible formatting

I saw a therapist for the first time in a few years...after talking about the different issues I felt I needed help with, she says that the common factor she hears is a lack of direction and purpose.  I’ve been dwelling in this ALL DAY. I’ve been a caregiver for my wife since 2010. She gets ill quite often so I’m the sole breadwinner, I care for her, and take care of the house about half the time.  But, because of my being focused on her, I’ve lost my purpose in life.  

That scares me...A LOT.


That means I’ve been a drone for the past 5+years. It explains why when I feel the need to go out sometimes, and when I do, have no clue what to do (I usually end up driving aimlessly for an hour).  But WOW.  I never thought I’d lose who I am or what my purpose is.  Now she is going to help me figure all that out.   I am scared I won’t like what I find.....has anyone else gone through this type of situation? How did it turn out for you?

I just turned 49, don’t live near family, she has a disease that won’t kill her but definitely messes with quality of life, I suffer from anxiety and depression, have no friends or support structure near by, and feel utterly lost and slightly hopeless.  

Thanks to those that provide real advice and aren’t out to be trolls.",26Oct2019,1
12,"Im not an insecure person with my looks but I really struggle with my personality. I know who I am and what I am but some people seem to purposefuly want to misunderstand me and end up having the wrong image of me in their heads. Insult my looks as much as you want and I dont care but when you say something bad about my personality I literally shatter into million pieces. It makes me feel so worthless when people dont want to hear what I actually mean when I say something and when they get so dead set on their opinion of me that no matter how much I tell them im not this or that they dont believe me.   I hate it that to be liked to some people I need to put on a whole another personality so I can actually not get in trouble with their opinions and then not end up getting hated on by them. I just want to be me and it seems that even the person im supposed to rely on the most has started to turn their backs on me just because I have my opinions and to them theyre not relatable. If I try to let my feelings out there they just get stepped on repeatedly and silenced which really hurts. I have boundaries and theyre not respected. Im able to have debates but when people throw hidden or not hidden insults towards my personality while debating with me it really hurts. The hidden ones that are said without using the specific insultive word and are used passive aggressively are the ones that hurt me the most. Like why cant debates be done in a way where you dont throw insults towards someones personality? Im so insecure about my personality that in the very beginning of my childhood I always pretended to be someone else and now that im done with pretending ive gotten to the stage of hurting myself because I just want to be understood and not made into the bad person just because I have feelings and im literally begging for people to stop throwing insults hidden or not at me when having debates or anything where I do something that they dont agree on. Why cant my boundaries be respected and when after the debate I want to let them know that ""hey. What you said really hurt my feelings and I want to talk about it because its going to bother me like a lot for a very long time"" I just get rejected with them saying its not worth their time or that they dont care even though these people should care. Just a simple apology of ""Im sorry that I hurt your feelings unintentionally and poked at your insecurities. I didnt mean it to come out like that."" would have been enough but it seems that these people dont even feel like they need to apologise to me even though I let them know about my insecurities and that it literally feels like someone is stabbing me with a knife to my heart and someone is choking me at the same time. My chest feels so tight, my throat feels like someone is choking me, I struggle holding in my tears and the rest of my body feels so very numb that it feels like ive lost my ability to control my limbs. Sometimes I lose the ability to form sentences because of insults towards my personality and sometimes my body gets goosebumbs because I feel so cold after such insults. Most of the time the insults are towards the way I speak. For example even in this message ive repeated the same things multiple times and to them it feels like im just trying to drill my point into their heads when in reality its just the way I speak. Im not trying to manipulate or brainwash. Its just the way I speak because its the most sencible way to speak for me. If something ive said before can answer something later I will say it again but just with a bit more detail. Im not a manipulating, brainwashing, inexperienced, worthless person. Im just a girl who has a specific way of speaking and who might sometimes try to figure out how someone can end with their opinion and guestion the logic behind it. Me really trying to understand your opinion but sometimes failing at it doesnt mean im inexperienced or an evil person. It makes me feel so stubid that I cant understand how someone can cheat on someone who they claim to love for example. No matter how hard I try and try I cant understand how someone can love someone but also cheat on them. Like im really trying my best and I dont need to be insulted thanks to me struggling to understand. I feel so alone. I have no one to go to with my feelings anymore because the person that promised to be there for me and to provide me a safezone around them has become one of these people that now think bad things about me because im really struggling and today this person said that they feel like im placing a minefield/traps infront of them when talking to them when in reality thats not true at all. I just dont want to be insulted when it comes to my already fragile self esteem towards my personality. Now that ive lost the person who used to just let me vent how I feel to them and has started to deny my speech and feelings my self esteem has gotten a lot worse. The person literally says that im not worth their time and they they dont care and they even say shut up to me.
Another problem that I have is the fact that because my personality is so easy to be insulted im getting desperate to find people who actually like me which leads into people using me and then throwing me out of their lives once they get what they want. Like a person that understands me and what I actually mean is someone who I value a lot in my life and then when they end up just using me and throwing me away or treating me bad its just a worse strike to my self esteem. I just need a person who loves me the way I am and wouldnt insult me with things that really hurt deep inside and make me feel physical pain. I truly feel so lonely. One of my worst fears is to one day wake up to a world where im the most hated person and nobody would want to love me as me. I hate it that I have to be a people pleaser all the time and I dont even have one person to give me that long lasting hug where they tell me ""I love you the way you are and I wouldnt change a thing in you. You are perfect the way you are and if you want to change you do it for yourself and no one else. You are important to me and you will be okay. I would never abandon you and I will be there for you like you are there for me. I am proud of you."" Im so done being scolded and then it being called advice when in reality its too harsh to be advice. Also how often do I need to be given advice in a month? Just please listen to me instead and be the person to actually encourage me into being a better person through positivity.",26Oct2019,1

14,"For quite a few months now, every time I've been speaking to people, my thoughts have been telling me ""shut up"" repeatedly along with ""no one cares just shut up"" and it's incredibly distracting. I saw a counsellor last year who said it's possible that I have GAD but I never got an official diagnosis as she decided to leave the programme. I've had panic attacks before and constantly cringe about every little thing that I do. I get agitated with myself easily, which I feel like I almost project onto others but reign it in before I upset anyone. I also get incredibly bad second hand embarrassment, for instance if I feel like my friend is talking too loud in a public space, I get extremely stressed out and visibly cringe, pulling my hair, visibly distressed, tense, and have to get away, even if my friend isn't really being that much of a disturbance and I know it's just me. It's a very visible and extreme reaction to something that I know deep down is minor and probably not even much of a disturbance at all. I feel like I annoy everyone around me but I also don't want to bring it up as I don't want to be seen as pathetic. I feel like people tolerate me. I'm thinking of going to see another counsellor but it will take at least two months to be seen by anyone and I don't know what to do in the meantime. Does anyone have any idea what these symptoms are? I'd be very happy to hear what you think as this is stressing me out a lot, the whole time I wrote this my brain was telling me to shut up and stop typing and it's doing my head in.",26Oct2019,2
15,"Growing up I wanted to be like my father. That statement doesn’t need any justification, it’s somethings that just make sense. Also, as part of growing up, I changed my mind. I saw flaws, the anger, the imperfection. I hated him. I hated the dream I had. I hated that he was cold and angry. I hated that he rarely smiles and says he was proud of me. I hated that despite trying my hardest I never got the recognition. It was all pointless, I was trying then I realized he wasn’t. But a few years back he had a moment. A moment that even he had probably forgotten. He was drunk then he cried as he asked me “do you know what I am?”. I couldn’t care less. He was drunk and I made the typical guesses I used to made hoping that the whole thing would be over. Nothing I said was right, he wasn’t carrying on with his stories. Then, he made me felt the guilty. He said he was an orphan, he never had a dad. He said he always feel lost and without guidance, he talked about how he searched for a mentor and never really got one, he said he wanted to be one for me and my sister. After that talk, I see him differently, for a short while. Not much change after the talk, this wasn’t a moment in a movie where all things turned around. I went back to resenting my father, this time because he didn’t become the mentor he talked about. I thought I found my mentors. The first was a lecturer at University. He was someone that I felt a connection with despite little interaction. We had a few talks, he took an interest in me and even helped me out with an internship at a big corporation. And again, I wanted to be like my mentor. I planned to have an appointment with him to talk about my career path. I planned but never did it. I thought I had more time, but he left 18 months after I first met him. After a short time, I started to wonder why he rated my as he did, and was he really someone that close to me. We rarely talked outside the classroom, and even in class I was always quiet… I noticed a few things that he said and did and felt a connection because somehow, I felt like know those behavior well. I thought he was like me, I didn’t have lots of friend, I sat alone in class. He said I was one of his best students in Vietnam and that I can reach out to him anytime especially if I need a letter of recommendation should I plan to continue my study. How could he know that I was as good as he though, and if he couldn’t know, how could I ask for such a favor. We haven’t talked since he gone back to Australia. The second mentor I though I had was my “boss” at the tutoring job I had at Uni. I spent more time with her, we talked more often. With her, it’s almost like I know that she knew me… I asked her for advices. She was a friend. And just my luck, something happened, and she moved back to Korea with her husband. We still talk every few months. A few words when I wanted to update her about my life or for whatever reason… She also offered to keep in touch and to reach out to her for help with academic recommendation… But even though we were close, I still fear that after a few years I wouldn’t be someone that can comfortably ask her to help. In a few years, I will be a stranger…",26Oct2019,1

19,"I love my boyfriend, do not get me wrong there. Whenever he asks me what is wrong, I cringe, and I have sinking feeling inside. I don't want to voice what I am feeling, because I just know he, nor anyone else will understand. He had a positive outlook on life, ""things will get better"", I always respond, ""you don't know that"". I don't feel understood, instead I feel dismissed.  When I talk, I get a response, ""don't worry things will get better, you have me here"". Yes that is true, but did you hear what I just said? What are your thoughts? Do you feel it too? I'm so alone here right now.

 To me, I find it pointless to talk about it, because no one can fix my problems. The problems  I am facing are out of my control in this point and time. For example, I am living, well, I am stuck living at home. I am in grad school, will be for 3 years. I have  a loving bf who is working hard to get me out of here. I hate being at home. It is extremely toxic for me, and I cannot escape it here. Everything time I try to get away I am harassed about when I am coming back. I have a poor excuse for a father, an absent sister, and a mother who is clingy, ignorant, and  does not support my career choice.  She only cares about her problems, or her mother's (my grandmother) issues. No one asks me who school is going, how I am coping, but I have to listen to them go one about their day and be expected to be there. If not, I'm harassed by my mother. I hate being at home, I am always sad here. I do not know how to escape, how to leave. Do I increase my debt and add on money to my loan to get an apartment? I just feel this isn't smart.

20,"My dad stopped taking Prozac, which he was prescribed for depression after having both cancer and a stroke immediately following the cancer treatment.

I found them quite stressful to change/find the one that would work, and I dislike the idea of temporary fixes and would rather fix the bigger picture. Me and my doctor agreed that my depression is mainly caused by a chemical inbalance, with the occasional physical reason too.

On to the rant/advice. I'm not the best at writing/explaining so it may be a bit scrambled. Basically, my living environment isn't the healthiest for me, I'm living at home with my parents, we're living comfortably, so its nothing like that. The primary issue is that my parents have health issues of their own. My dad is always constantly stressed, and takes it out on the people around him (AKA me and my family), this isn't my primary issue, as he's getting better with it.

This is my primary issue, I stay up to times similar to her, and have to see what comes around with her drinking habits. Now, she's not a bad drunk, she's just really relaxed, and the fact that its starting to cause many other health issues due to ther drinking, which the doctor even told her about. I've tried helping her constantly to get better, but she just ignores me and lies to my face. This is by far my biggest stress currently, which is adding to my depression as is. The thing is, I can't get away from this, I'm currently unemployed so I can't move out, and my MH limits the jobs I could possibly do. 

I do have other family members I could possibly move in with, but its the fact that its my Grandma on my Mum's side, meaning anything I say to either of them will get relayed to the other. I did move out temporarily during renovations on my room, and I must admit I did feel much better. Its just the fact that its in my mind constantly, knowing that my mum is basically just drinking herself to death infront of me, I honestly and physically cannot just let that happen.

I know that the best thing to do is to get away from the stresses and environment causing them issues (Or I believe this would be the best). But I cannot afford to move out, or don't want to rely on other family members to pay for anything, I dislike my parents paying for things for me as it is. I will definitely not be able to persuade her to go to a therapist or anything; she does know about her drinking issues, she just doesn't seem to want to change/be able to change. 

One part of me just wants to leave and never speak to her again, but I feel like this is far-fetched, despite it probably being the best option for me. The other half wants to stay and keep trying to help her, despite all the pain and stress it  is causing me. It just hurts me so much, as my mum was the one I'd talk to, before I realised the extent of her own issues, and it makes her feel untrustworthy to me, especially as she lies to my face constantly. My dad doesn't really understand depression and everything, so he's not a good source to talk to. I'm also awful at explaining and showing feelings, and just isolate myself most of the day.  Meaning I have nobody close that I can just speak to comfortably. I'm terrible at making and keeping friends and I'm practically alone.

27,"(Long story)
I’m 24 and I feel like a complete failure, like I don’t deserve anything I haven’t worked hard for anything.
Ever since I was a kid I went through a lot of emotional instability, it started with my parents &amp; their constant fighting. I was always afraid that my “dad” would do something horrible to her, because I remember once I woke in the middle of the night &amp; he had a gun..she was crying. He didn’t do anything because me and my siblings were watching. Then at 10 and still to this day I spent my life going to hospitals every single day. My brother had a car accident 14 years ago it affected his brain so he’s not how he used to be. He only 20 when it happened. I feel like I never got to live my life or a normal life at that..my teenage years were spent me sleeping so I can numb myself. I seemed heartless but I just didn’t want to feel anything. At 19, I finally was doing good was in college, got a job. But then at 20, i didn’t do anything at all, everything was going left. At 21, I started taking classes again and I had a stable babysitting job that paid me enough, &amp; lives with roommates. Then, I met this guy and ended up having strong feelings for him (lost my virginity to him). At 22, I had to move back with my parents, my close cousin died (this hit me hard), I couldn’t land a job so I babysat and other side jobs, and fell in a deep depression. Also, I ended up heartbroken..he played me bad, but then I ended up forgiving him. At 23, finally decided to let him go early that year..after seeing he didn’t care about me. I regained my self worth by doing so. I was also paying my debts off, getting close to god, and then ended landing a job. Then I lost the job later on..I relapsed had to do my side jobs again. Found out my ex got a gf, he treated her better than he ever did to me and was showing her off. At 24, I’m still doing my side jobs, still live at my parents, and idk what to do. I feel like I’m not capable of doing anything and I wasted all my good years. I feel like being with him affected me bad (wasted my good years focusing on this) and my cousins death. With my side jobs I barely make a 1,000 every month. It’s embarrassing.. I’m so depressed, I shouldn’t be in this position at 24. I’m broke, I pay for all my expenses, except for rent..I should be living on my own by now. I barely have experience in jobs, because I’ve only been doing side jobs. So I can’t land a job.",26Oct2019,1

Every day is a blur. I can’t remember anything that happened yesterday except my aunt coming over and drawing on a desk. I know I went to school and attended classes because it’s my schedule but I can’t remember doing it. I don’t remember what happened after I got home from school, before my aunt came over but also after she left.

Each day feels the same. I’m not trying to do good, I’m just trying to get through the day so I can go home and sleep. I always feel ready to pass out. Unfortunately my internal clock is wack and even though I feel ready to sleep any time I usually can’t sleep until at LEAST eleven, though often times I lie awake for hours on end—exhausted but unable to fall asleep.

I don’t have energy for anything. Sometimes I just lie down and do nothing for 15 minutes to an hour. I just lie down and close my eyes, breathe, and just think. I just don’t have energy to do anything. The other day I was doing the dishes and had to stop halfway through to lie down for ten minutes because I didn’t have it in me to finish it in one session.

33,"Lately, I've been experiencing ""depression""-like behavior. I have been through depression when I was younger; I'm almost 30 now so i'm no stranger to it. I started to research some of the thoughts I've been having lately (nothing akin to suicide or what I deem majorly wrong) but researching my mental state got me thinking i've developed ADHD or something similar. Science? (at least through my research of this) proves that is genetically passed down. 

&amp;#x200B;

A little about what i'm feeling/going through,

I feel anxiety. A ton of it; but only on my days off. When i'm basically away from everything; alone. I start to self-evaluate that I'm not where I want to be at in life at the moment and question my existence; as if it didn't matter if I was here or not. Once the work day rolls in again though, these feelings disappear and I'm ""normal"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel I don't have time to do anything I used to enjoy doing anymore. I was, (i can't even consider myself one anymore) an avid gamer. I streamed on twitch everyday when i started, bought a ton of things, but now i feel like i just don't care for it anymore; not streaming, but my hobbies in general. I used to be passionate about everything I enthralled myself in. Now I feel like i'm am empty husk of my formal self; and that I don't really feel like i have purpose anymore. I end up avoiding contact lately; and dismissing attention (more on this below).

&amp;#x200B;

Financially, I think i'm finally in a great position; though I do have a ton more effort I have to put in. I recently just transferred into a better job; and for privacy reasons I won't mention much more then that. But compared to my last job; I do have a lot less free time. When my days off come rolling in however; I end up lying to myself or others, making up excuses on why I can't hang out/play games/keep in contact with them for more then 5 minutes. I just kinda... end up sleeping the day away; knowing i had NOTHING to do that day or the next day. 

&amp;#x200B;

What really drove me to ask this on reddit though (because all of the above are phases most if not everyone goes through) is the fact that my attention span for everything is well.... at an all time low. I'm not sure if i developed some kind of mental state where I just can't pay attention to the things I used to love watching. I can't stay on and watch a youtube video for more then 2 minutes without clicking off of it and watching something else or doing something else entirely. I used to never be like that. This also goes back into not keeping contact with anyone for more then 5 minutes. I just feel annoyed or my mind drifts thinking about everything else i have going on in my life when i do talk to anyone; friends and family alike. I've been trying to actual get better about meeting new people as well prior to this but now; I just keep to myself 100% of the time outside of work when I know I want to go out and be active. This low attention span just really get's in the way. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm afraid of this not being a phase; as low attention span is something more along the lines of being an actual mental condition. It's not something you end up developing (or is it?). It's (from researching lately) something you've always had. I never really felt like I've had this; and it's really bothering me that I can't for the life of me concentrate on taking in anything I used to love watching anymore.

36,"I (27F) have hypothyroidism, generalized anxiety, dysthymia, and PTSD. I've been having panic attacks more often, anxiety almost daily, and definitely have been depressed to say the least along with being irritable as all hell and lashing out. 

I don't have insurance yet and can't afford to go to the doctor or a therapist out of pocket (though am on meds for my thyroid which are utd). 

The two worst symptoms I've been tackling have been 1. Feeling like I can't breathe, heart racing, vision narrows, heavy and shallow breaths, sensitive.  And then 2. I cannot hold any kind of conversation for more than a couple of minutes without disassociating really hard.. I've spent the last week  kind of in a haze of disassociation where it almost feels like I'm hungover and I literally only have a drink a month, maybe, and if that it's a single light cocktail so I know it's not that. It makes my head feel so weird and out of it and I cannot shake it at all. Some days I'll wake up okay and end with both of these things, and other days I'll just wake up like this. If I don't have either for the day it's because I'm so exhausted from not sleeping or being so overwhelmed with all these emotions. 

I feel like I've hit a wall.  I can usually work through everything by myself but this last month and a half has been great, as in everything is actually seemingly perfect in my life for once(ever!!) and I'm dealing with this with no crisis happening. It's making everything ba struggle for no damn reason.

I don’t know how to explain how far from who she was any of that is. 

But all of those things have really made me triggered and insecure - to a point I’ve checked her phone and just been a little paranoid.

I even freaked out because of what she was wearing when she went to a club for a gig (literally she NEVER drinks, NEVER goes clubbing, NEVER...) 
She bought a vest top thing that was really tight and revealing like I can clearly see her nipples through it
So when she put it on at home and was about to go out I was like ehh? because again she NEVER wears things like that
She said that she’s wearing a jacket over it and isn’t taking it off
She even complained how tight and revealing it was

when i am presenting infront of my classmates, i get very shaky and sweaty, and my face flushes and ill get overwhelmed.

These last few weeks have been pretty awful. I think 2 weeks ago my relationship as of almost 3 years ended. It wasn't a surprise and I think there were learnings for us both, and it was hardly a bad break up, but it still hurts like hell. I thought I was okay - I'm increasingly unsure.

Rewind a year and I moved to a different country. I am pretty useless at talking to people irl, especially in groups so I've really struggled to meet people here. No surprises I guess. This kinda worked okay since I used to speak with my SO at the time pretty much daily - it kept me sane and I had someone to talk to.

I did okay about a week...

It's not like I don't know anybody else - but I seriously struggle to talk about anything personal with the people I do know. I find myself almost lying with certain people to avoid personal stuff - and it's not like it's a concious effort but rather I am scared of what they might think if I told them. It makes it really hard to make any proper friends.

At this point my aquantances are related to coworkers - and people I used to know at school. The latter, I still talk to online ocassionally about stupid stuff but certainly I don't feel comfortable talking about anything important - it always ends up being the same how are you, what are you doing now, any plans for X holiday, etc. The former are just that, professional relationships. Ocassionally I'll get like 30 minutes where it feels like I do have a friend, and it's great, but it's always just by chance. I don't know how I can ever actually develop that into an actual friendship. I've found myself staying in the office longer just so I'm not totally alone, it's not great.

56,"Intelligence is a very hard thing to decipher what is, some people may believe getting good grades or being particularly good at something is intelligence; to me these are just results of hard work, dedication, and time investment. An absolute idiot could possess these characteristics and I’ve met many people that represent this argument.

For this post I’m going to give intelligence my own loose definition: critical thinking, logical and problem solving abilities as well as articulation and general awareness; for the most part these are things that can be judged but not necessarily accurately tested.

P.s. these are not the only things that warrant intelligence.

Anyways the point is has anyone else noticed intelligent people tend to be riddled with mental illness or disorders while lots of less intelligent people tend to be happy and confident? A lot of the more intelligent people tend to be born with disorders like Aspergers or ADHD and develop mental illnesses like Anxiety, Depression, Bipolar, OCD, etc. Why is this?

Does being intelligent almost always warrant your brain won’t be all to normal? Does it have to do with development maybe the same things that made them so intelligent also caused mental illness? (I struggled with neglect, abandonment, and had a lot of exposure to things I shouldn’t have as a child and from that I believe my necessity to figure things out on my own from a young age brought a form of intelligence as well as caused mental illness later in life) Why it so common to see mental illness among the high functioning?",26Oct2019,1

     His brother died when he was younger(11/12) and I don’t think he really ever got closure so he’s terrified of being abandoned.  He also overreacts to EVERYTHING. 2 years ago (16yrs old) his friends turned his minecraft house around and he got so mad he destroyed everything in his room and wouldn’t talk to his friends for a week.
     (I say he has extreme anger but he has never yelled/been angry/hit me at any point in our relationship.  He almost puts me on a pedestal and most definitely treats me as his whole world. He is very obsessive over me.) 
     A few months ago I was on the verge of breaking up with him because of him compulsively lying about his addictions and when he was using/where he would be.  I said something along the lines of “I don’t think we should do this anymore I think I may want to break up.” I left his house after this because I needed to meet with a group for school and I couldn’t miss the meeting.  He IMMEDIATELY takes all of his meds (attempting to overdose) and his mother has to take him to the hospital to reverse it.
     Currently he is only diagnosed with PTSD and Depression but I think something more is going on.

If you're not interested stop reading.

I'm 14 years old. I'm 174 and 68kgs and have a curvy figure as everyone else says, although I don't see it. Even though I have a BMI of 22, I'm still convinced that I'm fat for whatever reason... 
I dislike my fat stomach. This weird line I have just above my belly button. And I also dislike my fat thighs. Most of all, those damn hip dips. These may very well exist, not exist or just be very unnoticable, but for me, I see a cow lmao. It's gotten to the point where I'm constantly checking my appearance in the mirror. Sometimes I look in the mirror more than one hundred times a day. I'm not sure whether what I see is real. Sometimes, I'm just walking past the window of a shop and I will accidentally see my reflection. For a split second, I look skinny but then I go back for another look and I look fat again. And I'm so confused. I'm always comparing myself to others and I always end up upset, sometimes to the point of crying actually.

I constantly count my calories, if I've eaten over the calorie limit, I'll workout for almost 2 hours to burn it off. I restrict myself of treats a lot. If I do, I will eat a lot of it and then not eat anything for the rest of the day which is horrible.

Everyone I know says I'm skinny, but for some reason I choose to think opposite. I'm honestly scared this will turn into an eating disorder...

I don't know whether I'm seeing things honestly. All I know is that i think I look fat. Sorry for this rant but yeah, hope some of you can help me with this.",26Oct2019,7

Even with a good network of friends and family I still feel so alone and isolated from life.

I've never really been in a relationship, I was close with one girl who I really thought was the one and she eventually got bored of me, because well, in this state I'm quite frankly boring and clingy. 

I find it hard to open up and trust people. I'm still suffering with mental health issues and I'm a bit of a broken soul.

The moment a girl is interested in me i somehow find a way to distance myself from her, the moment a girl is disinterested in me I find it overwhelmingly difficult to part. I don't feel emotionally stable and though I want a relationship, I feel that if I was ever in a long term relationship and it eventually parted it would hurt so bad!

87,"Hi r/mentalhealth

My health background:

I have a recurring depression and ADD.   
The last depressive episode was triggered about 3 months ago after I escaped from a toxic relationship.   
For the first time in my life, I played with open cards at my employer's, which was a very good decision.  
My company and my colleagues helped me a lot to rebuild my self-esteem.  
So, I have worked a lot in the last weeks, which was very rewarding but also cost a lot of energy.

Now we have weekend. The apartment is in a chaotic state. I would like to change this urgently. I'd like to do my household chores. I need to go groceries shopping. Then there is beautiful weather and actually I want to hike in the forest and in the heath.

What I do instead is to procrastinate, watch videos and I get to do nothing.  I gained 10+ kilograms of weight from one of my antidepressants (mirtazapine) and I'd like to do some sports.  
I don't know where to start and I can't find the energy to start. It is like I am paralyzed.

Do you know that and do you have any tips and advice?   How do you get started? How do you find the balance between work and private life?

I personally are a F25 and I use CBT to handle my anxiety diagnosis. I have been to therapy several times so I know the drill but from time to time I just get lazy, no not do my ""homework"" and I fall apart. I'm also on medication

Send me a PM if you are interested, I do mostly look for a female since an incident with a male is one of the reasons I have anxiety in the first place.

90,"So a little background my wife has bipolar, an anxiety disorder and has had trouble with post natal depression. After our little girl was born she hit rock bottom and we had her put into a psychiatric hospital that specialises with woman post natal depression, it was good because the baby can also stay there so they can still manage to form bond and heal which was great.

That was two years ago and my wife got better for a while and then got worse, then better and then worse etc...

Because of her condition I have basically taken charge and just do everything, I cook all the meals, clean all the dishes, wash all the clothes, I am the full time carer for our baby and for her basically. She can look after our baby when it's just them while I'm at work but as soon as I get home she checks out..

Anyway I'm going on a bit, I'm just exhausted and over it. Her psychiatrist can't seem to help her anymore and she isn't willing to go-to a different Dr... 

Her manic moods make her super irritable and the slightest thing will set her into a rage where she screams that she hates me and throws things around. She claims that she doesn't mean any of it and that it is her insecurity that she believes I'll leave and take our baby.. I don't know if I believe her and I'm starting to think she actually hates me. She's also drinking a lot..

I've talked to him once before, just casually nothing serious. I wave and smile at him when I see him in the hallway, and sometimes he gets surprised by it.

Everything seems to be fine so far since I've seen a few guys hang out with him occasionally.

BUT he's been sharing stuff about suicide and suicidal thoughts on social media and it's alarming. It's giving me flashbacks of when I was in a similar mindset, and I feel like if I don't do anything I'd regret it. So how do I approach this?

Two days ago, while I was returning from work, I saw a pretty, stray calico cat playing around my garage (it’s an open garage). I managed to befriend it and it was a very friendly cat. I left water out for it every day in hopes that it would come back and play again. My parents are heavily against animals in the house and my dad keeps threatening to kill animals in general and that, in turn, sets off my anxiety and paranoia. 

I know the information is all over the place but is there a way I can convince my therapist to let me have an emotional support animal?

101,"I've had many mental diseases all at once and I wanted to share what worked for me, and I've tried many things. PLEASE CONSULT YOUR PHYSICIAN BEFORE TAKING ANY OF THE DRUGS.

Depression: If your depression is more like having negative thoughts, the best medicine that I used for this is Sertraline. If it's like you're having little energy to do stuff, than you should choose Efexor instead. Modafinil kinda made me get up from my bed too but I'm not sure of this.

You may be having dullness which can be confused with depression. Nootropil helped me with this issue and kinda brought me to myself.

OCD: The best drug I use for this is Sertralin again.

Trauma: Seroquel helped me with the anger issue that comes from the trauma. Also Dideral made the trauma feel lighter.

Stress: Ginseng and gingko herbs. I wonder why there aren't any drugs for this.

Restlessness: There are different diseases that causes restlessness. If it's hysteria, the herb Valerian is one of the best working drugs that I used for a disease. If you're having more of a scratching your skin feeling than it could be Akatisia you're having. Akineton is the drug for that. Atarax works too but it may make you depressed so start slow.

Anger: Seroquel and valerian worked for me for this in different ways which I can't explain.

I also suggest meditation apps like Calm, Headspace and Simple Habit which brought me visible changes, even if it's for a couple of hours. But I think using them continuously will bring permanent results. Just try a couple of the many sessions and stick with which one works for you the best.

Fabulous app also works for me. Just don't go hard on yourself with exercises and other stuff, you may get discouraged otherwise. And don't forget, all options are getting activated when you progress in the first Journey.

This concludes the best of the methods and drugs that worked for me. I feel I have a little more to go but I'm far away from where I started. One more thing, if a side effect occurs after using a drug, take a drug for that issue too. I hope I could be helpful.",26Oct2019,2

104,"So I'm like that, at least since shit hit the fan -- in 2007, at the age of 14. I rarely to talk to my parents and my brother, and when I do, I do it to vent my frustrations. Other scenario is when I basically have to force myself to communicate, but after that I only feel unsatisfied and unfullfilled.

The only thing close to something meaningful is my female friend, who is very fun to be around, but even then I cannot connect fully and have reservations. Thoughts like ""I should just quit her"" and ""My feelings are too shallow"" circle around my head all the time. Never fucking content with what I have, even though I would feel shitty actually losing her, because she's the only one actually caring for me right now. Really shitty.

But all this shit dissipates for a brief moment once I drink coffee and I actually want to chat with my mother and there's a strong gratefulness I have my friend and I would never let them go and always be around when they need me... Oh. Yes.

105,"Hi all,

I often feel like people are talking about me, if I walk into the other room and away from others, I immediately think they are discussing poorly of me. It's not something that massively worries me as I'm not hugely bothered if people don't particularly like me, but sometimes I find it hard to know who to trust. If I go to the shop, even people I don't know I feel like the way they talk to me is as if I've done something wrong, like everyone's pissed off with me, often I don't talk to people as it just annoys me bavk in turn. The other day I went into town and had a slight freakout when I thought a woman was taking photos of me, thinking back on it now, as I try to rationalise it, I can dispel the thought that that may be the case, but at the time my heart was racing, I thought she was spying on me. Lately I've been wondering if I'm being monitered as if I'm suspected of a crime, I know I haven't done anything, but I wouldn't rule out foul play. Also little things like if someone is walking the same way as me, at the time I suspect being followed.

Some may call it paranoia, but even so, I don't like that word to be used unless I 100% know it's so, lest it convolutes the true meaning of paranoia.

If it means anything, I suffer with ASD and Bipolar, but my mood has been really stable for a long time, I'd suggest the idea that these instances are of an independent entity than within a Bipolar context",26Oct2019,2

He has hit us or anything but i was still scared. So yesterday i was trying to find my charger and i started to search in an old closet in our house we store some things we dont need. While searching i found a box with 50 9mm shells and a loaded clip but no gun. Now my anxiety is getting to me and i dont know what to do with the bullets. Ps my father was in the military police but 30 years ago and he worked there for 5 years. Can someone give me some advice becouse i am still scared.

111,"Hi guys.

I never thought I'd post something on reddit, but I've been wondering if I'm the only one facing these problems and wanted to hear other people's thoughts on this, so I decided to make a reddit post. I don't even know if this is the right place to post this stuff, but the subreddit title seems appropriate so here it goes...

To give a little background to this post I think I'd have to tell you a little about myself.

I'm a pretty ordinary guy and overall I'd say I'm doing okay in life. Raised properly, good family etc. Doing sports, enjoying social life and such.
What is probably a crucial part about me - I tend to be an overthinker. I always overthink and imagine things, sometimes daydream and seems like my mind is always non-stop working.
I just finished high-school and joined university. Elementary school through  high school everyone always had labeled me as a ""bright-mind"", usually top of the class in every subject and a smart guy overall.
Now that Ive joined uni Ive come to realise it was only the local pond I was a star in and there are tens maybe hundreds of people better at what theyre doing than me, to the point I almost feel like I'm falling behind.
Situations like this really make my mind race, I start developing thoughts like ""maybe this isn't for me"",""I should stop wasting my time"" even thoughts like ""God ive really become a disappointment"".

Today I started studying for my upcomming exam and realised ""God I don't know what I'm even studying for"" and I felt really lost. I started having all these thoughts and I had this thing I don't even know what to call- maybe a breakdown or a panic attack(?) To the point I almost cried, even though Im usually not a very emotional/sentimental guy. This isn't the only time it has happened.

I regularly find it hard to fall asleep, because of my mind, so it's like a snowball effect. I lose sleep, next day feel exhausted, can't focus during class and when I get home I feel so overwhelmed instead of studying I just crawl into my bed and fall asleep and stuff starts piling up.

I dont wanna say I'm mentally ill or stuff like that, because people these days, especially teenagers tend to label themselves as deppressed or ""f*cked in the head"" in order to gain some attention (maybe it's just me and they really are who am I to judge). But if these are the signs of someone who hasn't got their mind in the right place, I'd like to know.

I've been asked by my family members and friends many times ""are you depressed? Is everything okay with you?"" Seems like it's showing with my behaviour or from my looks, I don't even know. I always respond ""ofcourse not"" because I believe I'm actually not, but these questions have planted a seed of doubt and maybe I am but just dont realise it or my mind tends to ignore things like that? I'm not sure.


Maybe all of this is me overthinking it all and stuff really isn't as bad as I make it I don't know...

Sorry for the long read, I just thought i'd get things off my chest and look for some advice here, since I have the chance to keep my identity unanymous.

Hope to hear your thoughts and if anyone has ever had similar experiences, let me know. Any advice is welcome.
Thank you in advance.",26Oct2019,1
112,"Hey everyone.
I suffer from depression and anxiety. I've been on Sertraline and Lexotan for more than 7 years. I haven't had psychology ""help"" since I turned 18, I am now 22 years old. This year, 1 month and a half ago, I decided to go to the psychiatric emergency because I just feel miserable. The doctor told me to increase Sertraline, and to take 5 days of diazepam and stop taking lexotan. I've done it and the first 3 weeks were okay. The 4th week was when everything started falling... I started to feel numbness on my left hand and arm, going to my chest and burning the heck out of me when I started thinking about it too much.  I was really conscious of the blood streaming through the veins in my head, I felt my head really hot if it even makes any sense. I couldn't stop shaking... I went back to the psychiatric emergency and this time the doctors told me to keep taking the sertraline and go back to lexotan plus 2 other ""tranquilizers"". But I've never done it. I lowered the sertraline dose to the one I had for years, went back to lexotan and now, 3 weeks later, I don't feel any of those side effects anymore. Still feel depressed as heck, miserable. But don't feel/think I am going to die from a heart attack or aneurysm or something.

I was on a balcony just now and the image came into my mind and all I could think was why not? So im scared of what I could do and I dont have anyone. 

Just a resume, i had a bad childhood mostly down to my stepdad and my mum never standing up for me. When I had the chance to get out of there in the form of going to live with my boyfriend at his parents house I did.
Fast forward 14 years and im still living in this house but I feel like im having nervous breakouts constantly and nobody gives a shit.
Im always saving money to get out of here but there are always set backs,  losing jobs, not getting paid enough, not being able to find a job and then expenses etc.

Its got to the point where I would rather die than turn 30 in this house.

I had a huge falling out with my own family, they were bullying me into doing something that I didnt want to do and were insulting me and basicaly ripping into me saying things like they have no respect for me or the person that I am.

I just want a break, all my life living with a bully of a stepdad and then inlaws (nobody wants to live with their inlaws for so long doesnt matter if they are nice or horrible, mine dont even speak to me t he y just ignore me and even act like I dont exist turning lights off when im in the room and such)
Its like when is it gona be my time to be happy with my own safe space? 

I got myself a good job now, demanding and stressfull but at least now I can pay for my own food etc. 

It just kills me inside that my own family treat me in this way, why wont they help me cant everyone see that im crying out for help. And all i can do is rely on some kind words in reddit to try to get me through the day without killing myself, cos i have no reason to live",26Oct2019,2

From this, I get the common mood-swings etc. and more recently I've experienced lucid dreams and hearing the odd voice swearing at me.

What's unusual is the experience I had just the other day...

By the time I get home normally from college, it's dark (particularly this time of the year), and I take the bins out. My front door is one side of the house and the big green bins are the other so I have to walk the length of the house where about 4-5 cars can park.

As soon as I opened the front door, the pitch-black outdoors almost inverted and I felt overwhelmed and blinded by light I could barely stifle by squinting. I was very confused but without really giving it a lot of thought began walking towards the bins when I noticed how difficult walking was. It was like trying to walk in custard with fatigue across my whole body. 

When I went to look up to see the sun (as if it was the sun that had suddenly grown 100x bigger) I could see hundreds and thousands of black birds flying by my head at great speeds and I could feel the wind they were creating. The noise of their squawks got louder and louder until it became unbearable. After what felt like five minutes of this I finally reached the green bins. Next to the bins is a big metal box (boiler unit) and I could hear lots of birds trapped inside banging themselves trying to fly out and making a terrible noise also.

After that all I remember is getting back to the front door - my legs really aching from trying to walk so hard and then closing the door and walking back inside. Everything then went back to normal.

I don't know - it really confuses me. I wanted to sorta get that experience off my chest and also wondered if anyone else has had a similar experience?",26Oct2019,1

125,"Title says it all. Lately I feel no remorse, very little empathy, I don’t care of others safety and I only care about my own. For example a coworker was nearly badly injured because of me and I didn’t think oh shit I nearly killed him with a sawzaw instead I thought oh shit I’m gonna have some serious legal issues and I’m gonna loose my job. I had a heart to heart convo with my crying mother calling my insensitive and telling me about all the heartache going on in the household and I felt nothing. I felt no emotional distress during that convo. I do love her, I said I did and I do feel love I know damn well I do but aside from that I’m incapable of also showing my emotions on the outside. I have hurt people in the past which is why I’m on a throwaway and I will not lie the rush I got from it was almost as pleasurable as doing cocaine. I know right from wrong so obviously I’d never seek to hurt people but I don’t hesitate on that action when it’s needed. (I’ve had several self defenses with a lethal weapon) I imagine it’s normal to not feel bad about killing someone in a self defense situation however. I’m emotionally abusive to the dogs in the house, I don’t hurt them but the way I talk and treat them can be cruel and I can’t help it I do it without realizing. I try not to as they don’t deserve that but Idk why it happens. I only think about myself, of course I have a tendency to put girls before myself in social situations but once again... it’s usually because I’m trying to get laid that night. I’m not worried or bothered at the “numbness” I feel I’m just intrigued by it. I care about no one but myself, I know I’m a piece of shit for that but I cannot help it. I’m not evil, or mentally twisted the way some are. I just don’t feel emotions normally and I don’t know how to explain it. I’m numb that’s what I feel, drugs make me feel them all tho. Psychedelics in particular unlocked feelings I didn’t know I had. Cocaine is a close second but... I’m one of the can’t do to much coke or I’ll assault someone type of user. I’m an aggressive drunk and get the same way on stims. MDMA is the only stim to ever make me feel truly loving emotions however but that’s because of the insane serotonin rush. Idk why I wrote this I just don’t wanna talk to another person about it out of fear of being shamed and looked at as a sick man. I don’t do twisted things, I’d never hurt someone who doesn’t deserve it. I’m just looking for other people’s opinions and thoughts and perhaps even come across people with the same issue going on.

128,"I don’t know a great way to start this off, so I guess I’ll take this rant all the way back in my history. Let's go back to my first day of middle school.

Now, I live in a very ghetto area. Both my middle and high schools are ratchet as fuck. When I went to elementary school, it wasn’t like this at all. It was in a comfortable, stable, predominately white area. It was like a normal elementary school. I had no exposure to memes, other than those old classic memes with white text and what not. I had no exposure to the hood, vines, memes, etc. All of that, I never even heard of. And so, it was very surprising and awakening when I went to middle school. I never experienced something like this before. It was alien to me. It was a whole new world that I had to adapt to.

The thing I am talking about today is my two personalities. The two versions of myself. Not anything like Multiple Personality Disorder/Dissociative Identity Disorder or anything like that. I mean the two different versions of myself.

One of my versions is the shy, quiet, loner kid. The kid that obviously would get picked on. The serious, almost emotionless, quiet and shy little proper white kid. The other version of me, is ghetto, swears a lot, and whatever. I developed the other personality, because I had to. If I didn’t act like everyone else, if I didn’t adapt to the way the social system works, if I didn’t adapt to this new, unknown world, how was I going to survive?

I remember when I was in middle school. I remember all the bullying that happened to me, and how being bullied by ghetto kids all the time for years, definitely changed me. I remember all the times I was picked on. It’s a funny, albeit cringy thing now, that I am a much different person than I was back then. I remember how much it affected me, living in that lifestyle. I still remember many moments from back then, many fights I got in. I remember how much I hated those who ever bullied and harassed me. I remember being so serious about it. I remember it got so bad that I even wanted to murder all of them. I remember the fantasies and planning I had, about going to school, and killing everybody. It sounds bad, especially when it was in middle school, but I remember being so serious and torn apart by it all. Now, of course, looking back, I cringe and laugh about that shit now, but I still remember it all vividly. I still remember the day that I was THIS close to actually going to my school with a knife and killing everybody, but I decided not to. I still remember that shit, even though, now, I laugh and cringe by it. And that goes to show you how much I changed since then, how much I adapted to the lifestyle of going to school in ghetto areas.

I change just in personality a lot depending on who I am with, or where I am at. It’s like, if I am with one of my homies, even if they’re with their own friends, who I normally would be too shy to talk to, even in front of teachers and adults, whatever, my confidence level goes up. I’m instantly the fun, funny, ghetto white boy. Even if it’s with a total stranger, if the situation calls for it, I change my own personality on instinct. It’s like a switch is flipped. If there’s ever a stressful situation, like maybe someone is harassing me, or talking shit, or there is someone on some fuck shit, any situation that gets me sweaty, scared, whatever, my brain just takes over, I react on instinct. I can’t even think or control myself at that point. My brain just reacts and takes over. I’m a slave to my own brain. I’ll end up acting all hood and shit, though sometimes my brain just switches to the other, quiet, passive, boring version. Whatever the situation is, I just react.

Now the thing is, is that these two versions of myself, it’s tearing me apart at this point. It’s like a game of Tug of War, with my two personalities going at it, trying to take control of my body and mind. At this point, it’s controlling and ruining my life. My relationship with my parents and family feels so alien at this point. My parents always wonder why I act all quiet, serious, almost like a zombie all the time, they wonder why I always seem all depressed and whatever, and the answer is, is that I have to. If I ever acted all ghetto and shit, they wouldn’t like it. They already don’t like it when their own kids swear in front of them, like saying a fucking word that society says is bad for some reason will place some harm on them? I don’t know. But I do know that if I ever acted like that, they would get mad about that, they wouldn’t like it, and so I’m forced to use my other personality. This ruined my whole relationship with my parents, siblings, whatever. If I’m with a close relative, like my nephew, who is used to me acting that way, and is kind of that way himself, I bring a bit of my ghetto-ness out, and it feels good, like my mind feels more free and relaxed, than if I am with, literally anyone else in my family. It is just hard to even have any enjoyment and fun with my family anymore. I wish I could go back to when I actually felt like I had a family, now I just feel like I have temporary owners, which is technically not wrong, but still, you get the idea. I have to act ghetto, because that’s just how you survive at this point. There are great things that I got from living in that lifestyle. I definitely became more intelligent, mature, aware of the world and reality, etc. It definitely brought many great things. But to me, the bad outweighs the good. The versions of myself are pulling me apart, I’m just a robot at this point. I developed that version as a coping mechanism, to adapt and be like everyone else, just so I could survive there. Before that, I had no friends, I was a shy, lonely, quiet, bullied kid that everyone loved to pick on, and ignore and laugh at. I used to get bullied all the time, and yet, after adapting and getting used to it all, I started mimicking everyone else subconsciously, just so I could have a chance to feel accepted, to have friends, because now, being a sophomore in high school, I have many friends now, and that is mostly because of the way I act. The only reason I even have friends and the only reason I even survive being in high school is because of that. It’s always funny when I’m with my friends and someone’s like “lol look at this Harry Potter looking ass white boy tryna talk hood lmao”. That is what I think it is subconsciously, it is all a coping mechanism.

But it’s not like it’s all fine and dandy, even with my friends. There have been many times that I’ve gone too far with how I act, that I even almost lost friends over it. I remember one time, I made a joke to one of my friends about how his mom was his girlfriend. Now, I know that seems fucked up, but the thing is, is that me and my friends, we roast each other all the time, we throw insults at each other all day everyday. None of us ever get hurt or offended by any jokes we make, even if the roast is towards our families. And so when I was joking with him like I always do, he started reacting all angry and violent at me, and I didn’t even know what I did wrong. He even blocked me on Snapchat and everything. I even talked to some of my other friends about it, and even they started reacting all angry. They didn’t want me to talk to them ever again. The drama got bad as shit. As it turns out, they, and their friends were planning to jump me during school. One of my friends got together with a few of his friends and walked me down to apologize to my other friend, because yeah, I shouldn’t have made that comment to him, knowing how much he loves his girl, and so I was like “aight, I’ll solve this real quick”, and so we went down. They gathered around me, because apparently they would probably fight me, and apparently I can’t defend myself worth a shit, and so they all gathered by me, walking me down there. As I’m walking, we’re going down, and one of his friends was like “wow him? He looks so small and little, like he can’t even defend himself. He looks like an innocent kid, why are they trying to fight him?” And they were talking about how scrawny I am, so yeah, that definitely didn’t help it. So yeah, we all made up, they forgave me and that was it. Good thing too. I would’ve lost the most important friends here. Without them school would’ve been EVEN more boring than it already is. There were also times where people got way too offended and angry just because I joke around all the time. Just today, I was messing with my friends, right, and we always roast each other, call each other gay and shit like that. Apparently the lesbian in the class got offended by that, while we were working, and was like “as a person who is gay, can you like, shut the fuck up” and talking shit like that, and she even threw shit at me, pushing me out the doorways like an angry mom and doing shit like that. Because apparently jokingly calling your friends gay, even though they don’t really care about it at all, they do it to me as well, we just fuck with each other, and apparently people just can’t take a joke at this point. It’s like, all I want to do is have fun, make people laugh. I fantasize every day about being with my friends, laughing, roasting each other, whatever, and we all laugh at each other, have fun, all that. Apparently that’s impossible in reality. There’s this one asshole in my class, that is all sarcastic and disrespectful all the time. Everyday he acts all bitchy whenever I’m around. One time, I was cleaning the area, turning off lights, being organized, shit like that. I went to turn off the lights in this one room, and closed the door. I didn’t even know he was in the room. He starts yelling and shit being all like “turn the FUCKING lights back on” and yelling and shit, and I was like “oh my bad”, even though I should’ve been like “bitch who the fuck is you yelling at” and all that. One time, I was just sitting in my chair talking to my friend, and he was talking about some random girl that likes hitting him playfully, and I don’t even remember what I said, I was joking about shit like “yo pussy ass wouldn’t even hit back either lol” and he was like “shut up freshmen lol” and shit like that, and then he walked over to the asshole kid, and he was like “he said I was a pussy because I wouldn’t hit (girl’s name) back XD”, and the dude walked up and was like “well if you hit her I’d prolly snap your neck but...” then he turns to me “if you did it I’d probably do worse, I don’t really like you that much”. I don’t know why this motherfucker keeps talking shit. Like what did I do to him that makes him be all fucking rude and disrespectful?

At this point I don’t know if anyone can take a joke anymore. No one can accept my sense of humor. I try to be all funny and shit and people just mock me wherever I go. I’m just not good enough for anyone I guess.

Anyways, these two personalities control everything in my life. It doesn’t even feel like I’m a human at this point, that I’m just an advanced robot that is really good at acting. Am I really a human? Do I really feel emotion at all? It certainly doesn’t feel like it. To me, even when I am laughing, or whatever, it doesn’t feel like I am actually feeling anything, it just feels like I’m acting. Am I really happy? Or am I just pretending. I don’t know. I don’t know anything at this point.

I just hope I die so I don’t have to experience this shitty existence anymore. I don’t know how I survive this shit. I hope y’all have any feelings, any psychology or psychoanalysis or whatever y’all could tell me about myself. I don’t even know anything at this point. I don’t know how long I can stay alive. Maybe after I die I’ll be born into a better existence, I don’t know. Thank you guys.",26Oct2019,1
129,"A little background on me (21f) and my mental health. I've had depression and  (particularly social but also general esp these days) anxiety since around 11/12. I started going to therapy at 14, stopped at 17 (therapist moved away). I then started again at 19 and ended recently (therapist moved away..again). It helped me a TON.. but at this point I feel like I've gotten what I needed to gain from it. Towards the end I came in biweekly and still felt like I had to rack my brain for things I felt would be productive to discuss. When I had something to say it was about the the same stuff that at this point are just out of my control. That's why I want to try medication (er, again). 

I went to a psychiatrist for a short while (when I was 18 I think). He prescribed me Paxil- which honestly wasn't a bad experience but I unfortunately don't think I took it long enough to have the full experience. I stopped going to him because he generally made me uncomfortable. It's important that I have someone I'm comfortable with otherwise I'll be less inclined to go back. 

That's partly why I want to try an online psychiatrist (also because I live in nyc where it's kinda hard to find a good one in a convenient location that isn't hundreds of dollars)- chat to someone over the phone and then have them send over the prescription. They can't prescribe anything crazy like xanax, and I have a general understanding of dosages/knowing when it might be way too high- so safety isn't a worry of mine. I just want to know if anyone has tried this? Is the service good/effective? Any websites you recommend? 

TLDR- struggling with mental heath for a decade, want to retry medication, don't have time/money/will to go to physical psychiatrist, has anyone tried online psychiatric services?",26Oct2019,1

THE STORY AS TO WHY I WROTE THESE AND WHY I SHARE THEM NOW:
Hello.

So 2015 to early 2018 was a rough chunk of time for me, and to say it left my nerves frayed and me completely cooked from it all would be understatory at best. And it seems many I met on the way had a similar beast of a time.

In that time, I'd managed to get through a lot. A few highlights:
1. 2 of my animals dying within 4 days of each other.
2. 3 year nose-dive of a 10 year marriage into stressful divorce (which had a while swathe of events that could be classed as 'traumatic').
3. Suicidal family member who I had to keep an eye on and care for, for about 6 months straight.
4. Parents getting rapidly sick (heart issues, a stroke among other things).

There's a lot more, but I'm listing these so you can get a sense of what inspired me to eventually do the thing I'm sharing here. 

I also had some good things happen too. Can't ignore those! Had a game I produced / designed get nominated for an emmy and I worked on a bunch of fun things. The hours sucked, but tbh they kept my mind distracted which was well welcomed. Made new friends that now have a nice room dedicated to them in my heart, and learned I could get through things that I had no belief I'd be able to prior. That was probably the biggest positive I got out of all of it.

So fast forward to mid-2018 and I'm at work, and finally I feel the last crack before the dam breaks. 

My dog Tishie has her second renal failure. She pulls through, but two nights later, due to head swelling, she's unable to bark. She stares at me, I see she's wet herself and she looks terrified and confused. She starts having seizures. She shows decline in the following 24 hours and it looks like she's not at all going to be ok. We decide we should put her to sleep instead of letting her suffer more (she was getting subcutaneous fluids for 6 months prior and could no longer enjoy her favorite food - cheese!). She gives my hand a kiss on the way out like she's saying 'thanks'. I even offered her some chocolate so she could taste it on the way out (it's toxic to dogs, but you know they'd eat it if they could)...

Anyway. That was it. I quit my job, grabbed my stuff, took my savings and left. I knew I was a fucking mess and had to give myself a break.

I drove around America, went down to Peru, tried all sorts...

And learned a shitload. And got better. And learned more about what I needed to be at my best. What made me happier. Healthier. 

Turns out I had so much traumatic stuff that was buried in my body, I couldn't feel myself in the present. Turns out that's the thing that was missing, to be able to navigate choices in my life in a way that would bring me the most happiness. If you can't sense your present true state, how can you make any kind of decision that feels aligned with your truest desires?

I was able to start putting an understanding to how my brain works with emotional traumas and energies. And I was able to change some of it from within, using tools I'd been taught or intuited. Turns out our system has a complex pile of software in it that we've not been taught how to use for this purpose.

So I'm sharing that now. Here are the links again. I'll be writing more too.

134,"To start with I’m a 17 year old female. Living with depression since I was 7 and have developed more diagnosis after that, 5 to be exact.

I tried to commit suicide 4 times during my first year in junior high school and had to redo that year and ended up where I am now, in a different school.

I’m not American so we have another system were we get study-welfare(?) every month to help with living expenses. To get this money you have a minimum of presence in school (80-90%/ month) or else it gets withdrawn, obviously this makes sense. 

But, from the first day of school I gave them access to my medical journal and told them that I suffer from severe depression(+ other stuff) and migraines and will do my best to attend. 

They said ok and I thought that was the final. Now with no heads up they have withdrawn my study-“allowance” and I feel punished.

I understand that this is to prevent people to skip school for no reason, but they have read my file that is documented from that I was 7. And all my absence is sent from my parents to the school. 

I feel all alone, ashamed that I’m who I am and that I am struggling with life. I wish they could be supportive but instead they punish me and now I have to pay back the money that I got last month ($125)

140,"Please share your stories on the negative side effects of birth control if you’ve had any or know someone who has. 

I’ve been on birth control for close to a year now. (Nexplanon the arm implant) 

And I’ve gained a significant amount of weight (which sucks) but that’s usually expected as the main side effect of birth control and it’s not that big a deal.  (Also I’ve never before in my life had acne and now I do) 

However, my main concern is the mental health problems I’m having. 

I’ve had depression for several years now and for many reasons, but I have to admit it’s never been this bad before. Now I’m not immediately blaming it on birth control... but the significant change is too prominent to dismiss. Especially since I felt a strong sense of improvement before I got on birth control, and that immediately vanished.

I don’t really know how to explain it... but I just don’t feel like myself anymore. And for no good reason. Nothing bad is happening to me and nothing wrong is going on in my life currently (obviously I’m still healing from a lot of trauma and such from my past) but I’ve never not felt like myself. 
Nor have I ever felt this out of control of my own thoughts, conclusions, and emotions. 

It sounds strange, and I know it is, but truthfully... I feel a bit crazy at times. Or manic. I seem to have really manic episodes (at night usually) and I’m having trouble feeling normal and struggling to be motivated to do literally anything even if it’s the things I love the most. 

It constantly feels like my body is forcing me to be sleepy/tired feeling and I’m constantly putting up a fight trying to stay away from my bed.

I just don’t like this whole sense of insanity that I feel and the reason it concerns me so much is because birth control is my only option, I can’t afford to get pregnant. My arm implant last for 5 years so I don’t have to worry about remembering to take a pill or any of that. But I want to have clarity, I want to feel normal, and most importantly, I want to live a happy life. 

I’m tired of feeling this way, I’m tired of feeling out of control of my own brain. 

I truly just don’t know what to do. 

I’m looking into getting a therapist and going to the doctor over several problems. 

But until then, I’m worried if I do try a different form of birth control... will it only be the same? 

Also... if anyone else has experience with Nexplanon is this something everyone goes through? Have I not made it past the hump yet? Will this pass? Will everything level out? Will I feel normal again? I don’t know and I’m just scared either way.

Please help in any way you can. And thank you so much in advance.",26Oct2019,12
141,"Hello there, 

first: I'm not a native speaker so please excuse any mistakes I make. 

I should be happy. This week I finished my Master's degree. I'm free and can start with the next thing, but I feel like panicking. I work three jobs, had to study all the time and suddenly the studying is gone, the jobs became rather easy and I have to find a real job new. I could start my own projects now (writing stories, music, have hobbies and so on), but I feel like blocked, I feel anxious, like screaming and crying, but both aren't not working or I'm to restraint. 

At the same time, I had a relationship with a woman for about 6 months. She knew that I would eventually have to move away, but she wanted to begin the relationship anyway. After 6 months she became stressed about the fact, that I would move away and we agreed to end it, but stay friends. The following two months she was less stressed and happier than before. She has a very strong fear of losing people, and the uncertainty of the situation was too much for her and I just wanted her happiness. 

Now she asks for the second time, If we could try it again because I was so good to her and she really likes me and liked the time we had and she wants it again, even though my situation has not changed. I'm looking for a job, I can not control where I'm going to go. I have to go where I find work or a phd programm. But I want her to be happy, so should I agree? 

What do I want? Feel happy for once. I want to feel like celebrating, I achieved an important goal in my life, but I feel the same as before. I want to start new in another city, I want to go out before I want to settle down and I want everyone to be happy, because then, people tend to leave me alone, but at the same time I feel lonely and overpowered, while unchallenged as well and I have no goal in life. I had one, it didn't work out. It was a job in an institute, it didn't get funded, now I can't find anything like that. It's all fresh.

I have nobody besides my therapist to discuss narcissism with &amp; I want to deepen my understanding of how people have / are dealing with ‘living as a narcissist” &amp; “living with a narcissist”.

Hey all! A bit of background. My brother passed when I was 11, my parents became profoundly depressed &amp; eventually separated. I have lived my entire life with praise that in many ways exclusively stemmed from my brothers passing, and today I realize how it hurt me. 

I have been in psychotherapy for a little under a year now, and while it does help, I still have some fears. 

Through the last year it has become increasingly obvious that I have a very strong narcissistic sense of self. While though my life I have always been this person, clearing up a multiple year depression, the narcissism now stands quite apparent. 

When reviewing multiple psychologists stance on narcissism I realize one horrible fact: I cannot escape narcissism. I have always known manipulation, deceit, dead inner self, a desperation for external validation, but perhaps most detrimental is my inability to genuinely feel for others. While I have been practicing empathy for a while now, And yes I may think differently, I do not feel differently. 

Why is this damming? Because I don’t want money, or power, or fame, I want to deeply and genuinely connect with others around me. I’m convinced building &amp; cherishing relationships will help me build the emotional basis / framework of a proper/cohesive self. 

But for I am one man who stands against a great mental calamity &amp; I feel small.

Im afraid and I'm pretty sure I'm unable to talk about the other things Ive been struggling with for the past 5 plus years because a) it's pretty bad and I mean BAD  b) I'm afraid of the way she will react and c) I'm afraid of having too many mental problems to fix
Basically I have a lot of weird intrusive thoughts that I can't seem to control and that are directed towards people I know and love.

I thought it was odd but I left it, out of sheer nosyness I wanted to open one but he'd see the rip in the seal. I thought they might have been christmas cards.

I forgot all about it until today I was in his room to feed his rats and I spotted his notebook. He's been gone for weeks and my parents have been repainting the room and cleaning it. It was sat out on the desk so I read a page. He wrote about having this friend who he wasnt sure was real and said he was just finishing off writing his suicide notes and he needed to finish the one for this imaginary friend (hes around 18). Shamefully i have read his notebooks before and he has hnever written anything like this, if it hadnt been his handwriting i would have thought a 9 year old had written it. I dug around to try to find the envelopes again but they are gone.

He has overdosed before and been to the hospital so my parents know hes a risk, and they reckon he has some condition likemild autism or personality issues. One minute hes the kindest, most understanding and wise person, the next hes this unreasonable little kid saying all these horrible things. He doesnt do it for attention because hes very secretive usually. He went to a mates house a few days back for a week long sleepover thing and my mum clearly found the book while she was re decorating without his permission. I know she must have read it too. Hes stopped taking his anti depressants because he overdosed and cant swallow them anymore + the weight gain it causes. I cant say anything to him because hes such a loose cannon and my parents must already know. I dont know what to do. from what ive read in his notebook, He truly, deeply wants to die in a way i cant wrap my head around and i dont want him to go

154,"I (21F) started taking Zoloft 50mg again several months ago. I was doing very badly right before; I quit my job on a moment’s notice, and for 2 months after that I basically just stayed at home, slept most of the day, and played video games. It certainly helped a bit, and I ended up finding a new job that I relatively like, and my sleep habits improved (for the most part).

But recently... I’ve been feeling a little suicidal again. I dropped/failed out of college for a third time several weeks ago. My dad said that’s the final time he’s ever paying for it. (I’ve been paying half.) Now he’s pushing me to find a new job and work full-time. And... I can’t do that. I just know that, at this point in time, if I tried to move out, get an apartment, work full-time, etc. I would end up trying to kill myself. I would be completely alone.

I really only have 2 or 3 good friends IRL. They’re not like me, though, and adapted to adult life easily. One just recently moved 6 hours away. I have a few online friends, but that’s of course very different and doesn’t alleviate the need for person-to-person interaction. I do well for the most part on my own, but there are many times I’m very lonely.

My parents divorced when I was 10, and I ended up becoming extremely depressed and anxious. At the end of my 6th grade school year, I had to start going to public school and switched churches. Because of this, my lifelong friends were gone. I was isolated and miserable. I made some friends towards the end of my 8th grade year, but they were boys and were honestly a little cruel, and we hardly interacted at school, just while playing COD. Since that point to throughout high school, I had friends come and go. Shallow friendships with people that I had little in common with. No ugly breakups, just drifting apart.

I haven’t made any friends since high school. Occasionally my friends have parties that I’ll go to, and I enjoy talking to their friends, but beyond that I don’t meet new people. Even if I had attended my college classes more often than I did, I still don’t believe I would’ve ended up making friends.

I think it’s very possible that I have ADHD, and possibly even PTSD from my father. He has a very authoritarian style of parenting, and because of that I’ve always been very hesitant telling him anything at all, doing things with my friends, dating... I always feel on edge, afraid I may slip up and say or do something seemingly innocent, only for him to react badly. They don’t know this, but right before the divorce I’d hear my parents fighting at night sometimes. Between that and some of the things my mother has told me, I have some disturbing memories.

My mom means well, but she’s had a very hard life, and her view is you just have to get out there and do it. Kick life’s ass, I guess. I don’t think she understands how my brain literally just can’t do things like that. She’s not big on medication either; kind of a hippy type, but at the same time not at all.

My step-mom is a counselor with a Master’s degree. I’ve talked to her about my problems before, and she’s the one that noted ADHD. I’d really love a psych eval, and I’ve mentioned this several times over the last year, yet they’ve never scheduled one. I don’t have the money to pay for it without insurance. My dad just thinks I’m lazy. I know it’s a lot of money, but I just want to finally have some clarity in life and not feel like such a waste of space.

I’m at the end of the road now. I have very little money, I have no degree, I can’t get an “adult” job or support myself, I have no friends, my dad is pressuring me heavily, to the point where I’m just miserable and wanting to kill myself again. Every time I reach out for help, I think, “things will finally start getting better”, but they never do. Nobody actually helps me. I can’t keep cycling through my life like this.",26Oct2019,1

When I feel stressed or lonely, I imagine him. Sometimes I use him to give a mental voice to what I should do, a bit like a conscience. He helps in self-control.
I actually feel that when I'm not often imagining him (which is when I'm less stressed in life) I'm a more unpleasant person as I forget to consciously think about my actions and emotions.

158,"I went through a spell where. I would hear voices that where bipolar in their attitudes (praise one moment and then super critical another), I still hear them but they are less intense and seem to pertain ti things people are thinking as if I could read minds.

The voices started after a girl cheated on me (from my view at the time). And later remained and calmed down with the voices.

I often have trouble sleeping but found melatonin works for me. Coffee seems to calm my mood, nature calms me and I seem to have a grandfather complex where I look at other people as I assume a grandfather would (loving thoughts, intrigued by their interactions and having large empathy to the point I can end up inconveniencing myself, but also if someone crosses me I kid you not in retrospect I talk to them like they are children).

 I'm always anxious and in fight or flight mode when I'm around people I don't know, when people are angry I feel my most comfortable, I always feel mistrust from super friendly people.

 I also enjoy quiet things and loud things are enjoyable but they eventually make me too tired. I use a lot of energy to behave and do well toward others. I've never been diagnosed with anything, however, I did  go to a therapist for anger management evaluation for a few weeks, my mother took me out of it when the lady wanted to speak to her about her potential issues, she essentially thought my home life relationship was rooted in her behavior. I'm not really saying anything bad about my mom but we definitely did not get along well.

I think I need to get a check up cause I'm afraid (in a sense of forethought) that if I have this issue, it can always get worse especially with a moment of enough emotion stress like when I felt I was cheated on awhile ago (though yes I was actually cheated on).",26Oct2019,1

Okay, Reddit. I can't tell you how glad I am that this user is anonymous, because I know I'll look like a psycho by the end of this. This is... Something I need to do. I don't feel like a human being. I'm not going to kill myself or anything like that, I got over (Is that the correct terminology? Please don't attack me for my ignorance.) my suicidal thoughts a long time ago.

But I feel like an alien. A weird human-esque *thing* that is strangely good at everything... And an incredible fuck-up at the same time. It has to be a mental problem. It *has* to be... And yet every test and authority figure I turn to tells me ""you're not special"" or ""there is nothing wrong with you."" What else am I supposed to do?

I'm going to structure this as logically as I possibly can. I'll divide it into parts. I'll treat it a bit like a research paper... On myself. But I'm not testing any hypotheses here -- I'm just going to tell you a little about myself and then delve into the depths of my dark abyss of a brain. I have hours and hours to write this, but it will help me (and others, if they foolishly choose to read this hideous monstrosity of a post) navigate and organize my own problem. Maybe, just maybe, I'll have figured myself out by the end of this. Or, perhaps I won't. I'll leave it up to you, Reddit, because this is the sort of thing that I would never entrust to my friends or family.

So, to get to the bottom of this... it is into the hands of strangers that I must fall.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Part 1: Some Background

First off, I'd better explain my circumstances and where I'm coming from. It might not excuse my mental state or abhorrent thoughts in any way, but I don't know what else to do. Perhaps it will help someone looking back on all this one day.

I'm an eighteen year old Caucasian female. I'm in my first year of university and am currently gliding through school with A+'s in every course. I made straight A's throughout the last two years of middle school... and made only one B while taking a total of ten AP courses in high school (It was BC Calculus. Fuck math. I'll leave that to you mathemeticians.). The rest were all A's. I couldn't accept anything less. I took all but one AP class that my highly prestigious, private high school offered.

I'm also an artist. An animator. A writer, too! I love writing stories, and not a day goes by where I don't daydream about my fictional characters. I draw them. I draw them *every.* ***Single. DAY.*** I bring them motion in my animations, breathing life into something that never existed outside of my own mind...

My characters are the one thing that never fails to make me smile. And you know what? It's gotten me some attention! People think my art is good.  I won't go into too much detail (I don't want you finding and storming my real accounts, after all), but I'm getting... Popular on the internet. That was not something I ever thought would happen... But I love it. I'll get more into detail about it later, as it's actually important to how my brain works in general... But it's good to get the good stuff out first, right?

I seem like an all-star in a lot of ways. I'm not afraid to admit I'm talented. I like feeling smart, and I like making art that looks good. I take the most challenging courses possible, and I'm currently *bored* with school because of how easy it is. I tested out of many lower level classes because of my glowing high school grades, and it's still not hard enough. Everyone tells me to ""hold up"" like I'm a horse trying to break out of a pen. I'm enthusiastic about learning, about my art, and about my writing.

""Great, so what?"" you must be thinking. I'm a hormonal, slightly overweight, 5'0 young woman who's only ever had a single boyfriend in her life. Your mental image of me is probably an ugly, pimply pig in a wig. (Haha! Look at that, even now I can come up with some quirky alliteration and rhyme. It must be the writer in me.)

Well, guess what? I have more. I'm not going to dump my life's story on you, but I will tell you all that I can without exposing my identity. Why? Because I hope that in some way, I can justify why I'm such a strange *thing* living among the human race.

I had good grades and high personal standards for a reason. I grew up in a conservative, Southern suburban home as an only child... And my parents had high hopes for me. Their hopes became my hopes for myself. From my first elementary school years, my parents put on pressure to be good in school. Not just good academically, but also to be a good and disciplined person. They were both members of the U.S. Air Force (my father is now a retired veteran) and are some of the strongest people I know. *They* are highly disciplined and always have a plan. My father had a very well-paying job and I have never wanted for anything in my life. They gave me everything -- everything I needed to succeed, and all the pressure necessary to keep me from slacking...

They had good intentions, of course. Back then, as a little gradeschooler, I was in public school. The bar was very low for the general student body. They wanted me to succeed and rise above the rest, and so pressured me to *try.*

But amidst their encouragement, they planted some seeds within me. One of the most common things I heard when in grade school was ""you didn't try hard enough"" or ""you don't care enough about school"" when I didn't receive a desirable grade. What was a desirable grade, you might ask? Simple -- I had to get at least a 93% or higher (the score for ""A"" back in grade school) on every single assignment I ever took. Otherwise, I would be fed the ""you didn't try hard enough"" line.

See, there's a little problem with that. The majority of grade school and middle school assignments, as you might remember, were small. Small and easy... But with *very few questions*. The general assignment in my classes, as I recall, would be a 10/10 sort of assignment. You don't have to be a genius at math to get this: a 9/10 would be equal to a 90% on the assignment. That's pretty good, right? It certainly is a good grade in high school or college...

But it wasn't a good gradefor me back then. A 90% fell beneath the 93% threshold necessary to obtain an A on my assignment. Thus, every time I didn't get *every single question right,* it was an automatic 90 if I wasn't careful. Not an A.

Therefore, if I did not get a perfect score on every single assignment, I did not get an A. And I would be told I was not trying hard enough. You can imagine the incredible stress I began to pile upon myself as a result. In middle school, I would be given praise for getting A-grades by being given gifts -- that's perfectly well and good. But if I didn't make all A's? I would have things taken away. I was obsessed with my little handheld games, and my parents would blame my focus on that as the reason for my imperfect grades; thus, for a week or so, I would have everything electronic taken away from me. All for a single ""B"" grade.

My parents, of course, were putting on the pressure in grade school so that I would have a good work ethic in high school. I understand their mentality -- I don't approve of it, but I know they were just pressuring me to succeed. They stopped feeding me the ""you didn't try hard enough if you didn't get an A"" line once I got out of middle school, too -- I got into a highly prestigious, private high school, and they knew I really did care about school by then. The workload at this school was insane (it was a college prep school, of course), and the grading system was different as a result. Now, they would say things like ""oh, it's alright if you didn't get an A as long as you tried your best."" That was relieving, in a way...

But also *infuriating.* Their external reinforcement of good grades had become my own internal philosophy. They no longer held me to that impossible standard, but I did. To this day, I only look at non-A grades as failures. Imperfections.

*That* is why I got good grades. It wasn't at all because I enjoyed the assignments... It was because I pinned my self worth on them. Getting anything less than an A would lead to me telling *myself* that I wasn't trying hard enough. I never pinned this on other people -- I couldn't care less if my best friend got a B and was happy with it. But I would never accept that standard for myself. People would give me strange looks, asking ""why are you upset?"" when I would receive an 88 or 85 on an assignment... But to me, that grade was a sign of failure. A failure to be perfect.

This personal dialogue, when paired with merciless bullying during my middle school years, made me incredibly suicidal in my early teens. You know -- the classic ""emo"" phase we joke about. The one every kid is supposed to go through. The ""it's not a phase, Mom!"" thing. I didn't have an emo phase... I had a suicidal phase.

To this day, I believe that the world as a whole would be better off without me. I don't want to be part of this world sometimes. I think like a suicidal person in that sense, I suppose. Perhaps I'm being close-minded or arrogant in saying that... I apologize if I'm wrong or offensive. Whatever the case, though, I have always been too much of a coward to do anything about it. I've never cut myself or genuinely taken steps to commit suicide. I've always been afraid to. There was a point in middle school where I truly *considered* it, but I no longer do. 

It would be an incredible burden on my friends and family if I were to commit suicide. I wouldn't be relieving them, I would be traumatizing and harming them. I know everyone hates me to some degree, but I can't do that. I know it would do more harm to the people I truly care about than good.... And I am too afraid of death to consider it any longer.

I won't get too much farther into my life or my internal philosphy... I know some people out there like to sleuth around Reddit for mysteries to solve and people to locate. I'm not a mystery that deserves to be solved. I just want to put this somewhere. Somewhere where people can tell me what is wrong with me without knowing who I am. I know all of this has to mean something... It *has* to. I'm just laying out the pieces of the puzzle that make up my life. 

I've never been abused -- bullied, yes, but I've always had the possibility of support. I've just done this to myself. I know I hold myself to impossible standards and that I can never see past my own pitfalls to acknowledge my own successes... But I can't change. No matter how I look at things, if I don't make something ""perfect"" then I have failed as a student. As a creator. I have to be original, intelligent, and tenacious. **Ambitious.** 

\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Part 2: Emotional Woes

I had to hold myself back a lot while I was writing part one. Part one is supposed to be a little blurb about me, right? About my philosophies and my history...

**This next part is important. This is why I know there is something wrong with me.**

*I had to restrain myself from spouting nonsense and raving like a lunatic.* I felt angry and defensive when I began writing some parts of it. I felt like the writing was coming to life as a voice inside of me. When I was writing that justification to you, dear readers, at the end of part one... I wanted to yell at you. I wanted to type accusatory things.

I *wanted* to say, ""know that I am NOT some poor defenseless little priveledged girl who does nothing but mope and whine all day.""

I can't make assumptions like that. I'm relying on you Redditors to help me sort this out. You're strangers -- you don't know me... I must treat you as nicely as possible. I can't go pointing fingers when *I* know nothing about *you.* I should be thanking you all for even reading this.

I hope you can see my point, though. I become overwhelmed by emotion when writing. When thinking. When living. I become defensive and prickly at the slightest nudge.

My parents constantly scold me for negativity. While I am constantly viewed as the ""optimistic idealist"" by my friends, my parents see a completely different side of me. I don't have fun with my parents -- we don't like any of the same things. We just sort of... Coexist. I love them dearly, but our interests are wildly different from each other. They force themselves to watch and look at my creations to keep me happy. I can't even be bothered to watch a movie with them because I hate the genre the movie is from. I make self-depricating jokes and they yell at me. They tell me ""there is nothing wrong with you"" when I express concern that I may have some mental health issues. Thus, as you can imagine, I restrain myself the most when I am around my parents. No need to bother them with what optimism I have, and I'll just get told I'm ""wrong"" if I think something negative.

""Wrong."" I hate that word. **I fucking hate it.** ***I can't stand being ""wrong."" Nothing I ever do is ""right.""***

As you can imagine, the one emotion I struggle to control is... Anger. I can *barely* control my anger sometimes. I will always internalize my strong emotions -- I will bottle them up. Inevitably, every emotion I have turns into anger over time. I can restrain, control every single other emotion... But not anger. Anger makes me contort my facial muscles and is the endpoint of every other emotion I feel. 

* If I am deeply saddened by something, my internal saddness will turn to anger. My internal dialogue looks like this:
   * *(Directed at myself)* ""Stop crying. Stop crying. You are not a crybaby.""
   * *(Directed at myself)* ""How *dare* you cry and feel sorry for yourself? You did nothing to stop this. This is entirely on you. This is your own fault. You have no right to feel sad.""
* If I am annoyed by someone or something, that also turns to anger. Again, my internal dialogue:
   * *(Directed at the outside thing)* ""I don't give a damn about any of this. Stop fucking talking. Stop.""
   * *(Directed at myself)* ""Why am I getting annoyed with this person? You are just selfish. You are a disgusting human. You care only about what *you* think and say. Listen to them. You have no right to brush off what they say.""
* Even happiness and pride will turn to anger. I will feel ashamed for allowing myself to feel good... about myself.
   * *(Directed at myself)* ""Stop your gloating. You are no better than any other person. You are not special. You are not some special snowflake that deserves special attention. You are just like everyone else. You do not deserve to feel pride for this.""
   * *(Directed at myself)* ""Ha! Did you honestly believe that anyone would like this? No one has posted a comment. They all just like it and run. You're just one creator in a sea of better creators. No one will ever like what you do. You're too naive and stupid for your own good.""

This struggle with anger and restraint is the first example that there is something deeply wrong with me. But you know what? It's normal to have strong emotions. I'm sure you, dear reader, have felt incredible anger once or twice. You've probably bottled up your emotions for the sake of keeping others happy. I'm nothing special or pitiable for experiencing this. This is something everyone goes through.

So, again, what's the point? I once again find myself saying, ""but wait! There's more!"" to an audience who is in no mood for jokes or self-deprication.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Part 3: Did I Mention I'm a Writer?

Haha. In reading that header, I can just imagine what you must be thinking. ""Oh, great, more 'flexing.' Sheesh! This bitch won't shut up!""

I do, however, believe that being a writer and a creator plays a significant part in my mental state. You see...

**I think and live in the third person.**

In my thoughts, there is no ""I."" There is only ""she"" or ""you."" It's strange to contemplate, because all of this is being written in the first person... I believe my admittance to use first person here comes from the feeling of needing to justify myself. In my thoughts, however, there is only reflection and accusation.

My casual thought process reads like an outside observer reading a book about my life. When I reflect upon my actions, emotions, or blunders, there is only ""she.""

* ""She looked about the room in confusion. Damn it, where had she left them?""
* ""She couldn't stop fumbling with her fingers. She must have looked like a lunatic.""
* ""She caught herself before she could fall. What a stupid, clumsy girl.""

This is genuinely how I think about myself. My thoughts are far more composed than my speech. I speak callously and without regard for grammar, yet my thoughts read like a perfectly composed book. I catch myself doing this -- just thinking like a book -- all the time. Then, when I discover myself or turn on myself, my thoughts become accusatory.  When I am accusatory, the third person ""she"" becomes the second person ""you.""

* ""You've got to be kidding me. You're doing this again?""
* ""What the hell do you think you're doing, (my name)?""
* ""Okay, (my name,) you have to do X, Y, Z...""
* ""You NEED to get this done.""

It's gotten to the point where I will genuinely talk to myself. The dialogue in my head is so strong that I feel the need to say it. When I do, it's once again never ""*I'm* talking to *myself* again"" but is instead ""*You're* talking to *yourself* again.""

When my thoughts become directed at another person, things take a... Strange turn. I then begin to think of myself as... ""we."" Occasionally ""us."" I even speak in the ""royal we"" when speaking about myself sometimes.

* When addressing what fans I do have, I will say ""*We've got some great new things for you!""* or *""We've been hard at work to the produce this for you!""* ...What the hell is with that? I'm a singular person... I'll usually refer to myself as ""I"" or ""me"" when speaking. Why do I do this strange thing with the ""we?"" There is no ""we."" I'm not part of a corporation or group of people making my work. I am one singular person trying to make a name for herself.

I wonder if other people think like this? I've asked a couple of my friends about it. I always thought it was weird, even without knowing how other people think. They, of course, look at me like I'm a lunatic. I don't blame them for that.

My point in saying this, though, is that I believe there's a complete disconnect within myself. I don't look at myself as, well... Me. I look at myself like an outside character in a book.

This might be why I become so invested in creating characters and stories... I myself am just another character. A bland and uninteresting character, of course, but a character nonetheless.

I *do* realize that life isn't like a storybook... And I **hate** that. 

I'd love it if the world could be positive and idealistic like in a children's fairytale. I like that sort of thing. Of course, I also enjoy maturity in work... Hah, I'm indecisive, aren't I? I'm aware of that. The point is, I'll never settle for the mundane. Real life is... Boring. Infinitely boring. I want to be a historian or a paleontologist one day (not a writer or an artist -- I don't believe I could ever create work that's of a high enough quality for that) because I view history as one big story... It's all about stories for me. My life is a strange and complex story... And I want it to be a story that people remember.

I don't want to be some background character that the audience forgets about. I want to be the star of a memorable story. **I want to go down in history.** I want my name in the record-books for all eternity. I want to be like Marcus Tullius Cicero, Plutarch, Alexander the Great, Xenophon, Thucydides, Sappho, Homer, Ramses the Great, Imhotep, or... *Someone.*

My focus on life as a story is what makes me so ambitious. It is what causes me to set impossible standards for myself: I must be exceptional if I am to be remembered. Furthermore, I want to be remembered well -- I don't want to be remembered as a terrible and evil person. I want to be remembered for good works and days. That is the reason I bottle up my emotions -- I want to treat others well. They deserve better than me. Therefore, I must tailor everything I do to their wants and needs to make them happy. My lack of self control, however, only seems to cause others to hate me. 

I know this is what makes me eccentric. What makes me so strange... What makes me tick. The truly sad part is that I know I will never be remembered, no matter what I do. Within a generation my name will be forgotten by my descendants. We are finite beings that only occasionally rise to great things.

I wrote this all anonymously. I am truly nothing more than a coward. For someone who greatly wants  to be remembered for eternity, I cannot even own up to my own nature or my own opinions.

It is my ""writer brain,"" so to speak (this is what I dub it for now -- I apologize if you are a writer as well and that this alienates or offends you as a result), that has made me an outcast and a target for bullying all my life. Perhaps the bullying and ostracism has only reinforced my problem. I paradoxically love myself and hate myself. I am a narcissist and an autophobe at the same time.

It is all because I detach myself from... Myself.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Part 4: I Fear, Therefore I Am

This will be the last section. You can jump for joy, now, we're at the end! Almost.

This section doesn't really pertain to the others, strangely enough. It simply reinforces the fact that I am a coward. I am a coward and a weasel in every sense of the word -- **I fear everything and will do whatever I can to avoid my fears.** 

* I fear the vastness of space. 
* I fear the depths of the ocean. 
* I fear swimming within water I cannot swim in. 
* I fear fire and being burned in any way. 
* I fear social ostracism ~~(that fear may have already come true)~~. 
* I fear automobiles for their high speeds and probability for death. 
* I fear heights for the possibility of falling. I fear flying for the same reason I fear heights. 
* I fear obesity for the possibility of social ostracism as well as the poor health effects it brings. 
* I fear illness for the possibility of death and them misery it brings upon us.
* I fear large groups of people due to the noise and my lack of social prowess. 
* I fear other people for the things they may say about me. For the things that they may do to me.
* I fear failure and my own inadequacy. 
* I fear being forgotten and fading into history.
* I fear losing control of myself, my emotions, and my life.
* I fear punishment for my failures, inadequacy, or stupidity.
* I fear darkness for the things that dwell within it. 
* I fear tombs and I fear the dead within them ~~(my one genuine phobia -- necrophobia)~~.
* I fear my own incoming death. I question whether or not I will cease to exist or if I will go to the promised Heaven or to the depths of any hell.

If you can't tell from previous sections, I'm a worrier. I live in constant fear. Fear of inadequacy and failure, mostly. I fear that I will not positively change the lives of others around me, and that makes me more heartbroken than anything. Why do I fear so many things?

My parents lament my fearful nature. My mother asks, ""where's the brave and fearless little girl I raised? You're such a wuss. You're afraid of everything."" 

I sometimes think they hate what I've become. I am the first on my mother's side of the family for two generations to not join the Air Force or become a pilot.... And it's because of my fear. My lack of discipline. I cannot control myself and fear the possibility of punishment by any party. I never take ""real life"" risks. I take online risks by putting myself out to the world in a semi-anonymous setting where I don't have to show my face to everyone I meet. I'm too afraid to do this sort of thing in real life. I'm driven by my fears to be ambitious and my ambitions lead to more harm than good. It's self destructive, of course, but no matter what I do...

I can't force myself to change. I've tried. My brain continually stimulates panic and worry. Not a day goes by where I don't doubt something I've done recently or far in the past.

# Conclusion

This is it. The End. I've spluttered out everything I can from my drainage pipe of a brain. I don't know if I have the courage to look at whatever comments this post earns. I'd like guidance and help, but we of course know I am too cowardly to take proper action. I can imagine I'll get many comments telling me exactly that: this is my own fault. I know it is. 

But I won't get myself worked up before I go.

If you've read to the end... You are certainly worthy of respect. I won't question your life decisions, but it takes a special kind of person to read some sad little fat woman's introspective research paper.

I'll just settle for thanking you for reading. Don't crucify me in the comments, please. I know I'm horrid.",26Oct2019,5
166,"Hello! I suffer from anxiety and potential body Dysmorphia. I have not been professionally diagnosed with body Dysmorphia but I have been diagnosed with anxiety. 
At the moment my anxiety is at a high point (my body Dysmorphia is always pretty bad), for example, I went to a club (for general well-being) and I ended up sitting out trying to calm my self. I would have broke down if my friend hadn’t been there.
Because of this I have very low self esteem, and I always tell myself that I’m doing it for attention. I have had self harm thoughts (as I just wanted some control) but I feel like I can cope.
I just wanted to write this down and share it so I can get it off my mind for a few hours. Remember, you aint alone, and tell someone else about stuff you deal with. It helps.",26Oct2019,7
167,I tried so hard to learn and to keep up with people. I give up now. Everyone leaves anyways. No one understands me and that it's hard for me due to my autism. Life is so pointless. Everyone is gone. I am exhausted.....,26Oct2019,1
168,"I’ve been taking medication for anxiety/depression for almost three years now and the one thing that has not improved is the irritability. I was told by my doctor that irritability can be a symptom of one of the medications I was on (Effexor) but after stopping it, the irritability has not improved. 

I find myself randomly getting irritated by the smallest things, even just someone asking me a question. Anyone have any idea what this is or what I can do about it?",26Oct2019,1
169,I just want to die. I hate this,26Oct2019,0
170,"Hi. I’m 17. My psychiatrist has me on 15 mg Lexapro and 2 mg Abilify. I’ve been on this specific dosage for maybe 3-4 months. I’m considering asking her to drop the Abilify altogether and just increase the dose of Lexapro. I don’t really like being on 2 types of medications, and she said that she only added the Abilify as a sort of booster for the Lexapro
What do you think? Should I drop it or no?
Thanks.",26Oct2019,1
171,"I've never tried to commit suicide, and can't see myself ever doing so. With that said the thought of me dying and ways I should die as a response to simple fairures has always protrude my mind frequently since I was 13. Now 21 year old, after years of depression I feel like my ability to bounce back is gone. Instead of extreme lows and highs it's this constant miserable platitude. Even if I'm in a better situation now then I have ever been in my life, I still feel so numb to everything all the time. 

Everything is accompanied with some level of agervation or bitterness. I can't go through a day without getting pissed off  I'm always subconsciously prepared to go to a place of self pity. I really just lack the ability to frame things in a humourous/optimistic way. 

I really am scared that this is how it will be. I've been rejected from every social group in my life, never held a relationship, and don't have much affinity with any family members. 

How is can someone change their mindset? I don't feel like a weekly therapy session would be enough. Are there podcasts or books, something you'd recommend to use 1-2 a day to work on reinforcing new mindsets and adjusting to a more positive response to everyday things?",26Oct2019,1
172,"4 surgeries later.
5 years of constant antibiotics (cephalexin, bactrim, doxycycline)
Countless doctor visits to be lanced, stretched, packed, drained, more antibiotics, more discussions of the future, more reality checks that this is a life-long, chronic condition 
Close friends and family who don't understand what it is telling me to look into other doctors because I keep suffering with this

I finally recovered from my 4th surgery that was in July only to have my left axilla create a new incision on it's own next to the incision that finally healed, and then a few days later (this morning,) I wake up and am in so much pain in my left axilla...

I can feel the abscess.
I can feel it hot to the touch. 
I can feel it burning inside.
I can feel it just taunting me.
I can hear it telling me I will never be done.
I can hear it reminding me this is a lifelong commitment. 
I can hear it screaming that I will never look normal again in tanks because my armpits aren't going to be existent soon.
I can can hear mocking me over the fact that I just finished recovering and it's back...

Every fight has a winner.
Every fight has a bell.
Every fight eventually draws to an end.
Yet this one doesn't seem like it ever will.
I had so many aspirations!
I had dreams to one day make it in the cage.
Yet it seems before I get there...
HS is going to cage me.
I feel trapped, stuck, immobile. 
I feel like I will never have victory. 
I used to train jiu jitsu,
But now jiu jitsu begs for me.
It knows I can be tougher,
But HS drags me away.
It drags me into the depths of hell as it burns my armpits away.

Guys, this fight feels like it's one of my life, and I'm not fighting very well. No, this isn't meant to be a poem, my thoughts are just so scattered... I don't know how to breathe right now, how to keep pressing on, or how to gain the victory in this. And honestly? It feels like I'm losing this fight.",26Oct2019,6
173,"So this year hasn't been a great year for me. My anxiety has returned, work has sucked. The biggest thing i've found though is that every hobby, music etc. i used to enjoy is just plain boring now. I used to ride mountain bikes, motorbikes, go out drinking with friends, want to do stuff with my girlfriend, but all of that just feels so boring and i feel no enjoyment from any of those things anymore. I just really don't know what to think. I just want to sit inside alone and not have anything to do with anyone anymore. 

What is happening with me!? Is it just because i've worked so much lately? Am i just exhausted? Do i need a holiday!?",26Oct2019,3
174,"i notice my anxiety is particularly bad on friday nights. i’m curious—for those that work that typical 9-5 routine—if you experience this too. i’m 28, work a desk job (i don’t loathe it but it’s not my dream, for sure), in a committed, healthy &amp; happy relationship, have loyal friends, and in the best shape of my life. but on fridays— i’m irritable, anxious, unhappy and unable to identify why.",26Oct2019,1

176,"I've been thinking about take a year or something from university but I keep going and doing all the stuff i have to do, but lately I've been feeling kinda depressed and my bulimic habits too, idk what to do cause i'm really down right now, and idk how to tell my parents how i'm feeling, like i've been un therapy for one year and i have changed a lot but im so tired about everything and my friends are dealing with their own stuff",26Oct2019,1
177,"I don't know when it started, but I am to a point where everything feels overwhelming. I have been out of work. Every interview seems to take days for me to recover from. I dont really socialize anymore. I start stressing the moment I get into a car. My hobby feels like it is draining my life out of me, It feels like an obligation rather than enjoyable. I had a panic attack playing a trivia game online with my family. Even intimacy is difficult.",26Oct2019,1
