0,"So, here goes. I work in a seasonal job, where the season has basically come to an end. I'll be here another two months, and them I'm moving back home after Halloween. There are two locations, but I came up here to be a bike mechanic, and I'm supposed to be training under someone who is basically an asshole, and just won't train me. I'm up here with my fiance. It was her cousin who got us the jobs, who has been working for this company with her husband for a few years now. When I work with them at the other location, I'm truly happy and it hardly even feels like work. I get to work on bikes and I have people to talk to and the day flies by. But I usually work at the place that my apartment is attached to. When im there, my supervisor refuses to train me, so I haven't been able to actually do the job I came up her to do, and instead I'm stuck trying to look busy and I walk on eggshells all day trying to not get snapped at. Trying not to upset my supervisor in the hopes that he will train me. I feel so trapped and it's making me extremely depressed. I haven't worked in a long time, so it's been really difficult to adjust to the long hours and harsh coworkers. I'm constantly snapped at and interrogated by my supervisor. Earlier today he got in my face before I was even scheduled to work. A few days ago he yelled at me for going into my apartment while I was on break, off the clock, which my actual boss has told me is perfectly acceptable. I feel like I can't leave my room, or I'll get interrogated. I feel like I can't handle working at this place anymore. There's no explicit structure, but if I do the wrong thing in berated or yelled at. And I mean yelled. He does actually yell. He does actually get in my face, and get aggressive with me. I don't understand what I'm doing wrong. I haven't done anything to him or even done anything wrong. According to everyone else I'm doing a great job, but it doesn't feel like it. I'm just so anxious I feel like I'm going to vomit. I know if I could calm down about it I would be okay, but everything is just so overwhelming. If anyone has any advice on dealing with work anxiety, I could really use it right now. I have to work in the morning and I don't know how I'm going to pull myself out of bed. 

TL;DR: My work makes me super depressed and anxious and I feel trapped and like I can't leave my apartment.",06Sep2019,2
1,"Hello all! Let's keep this short and simple.  I love my mom, so much, but I physically can not handle the stress she lays down on me daily.  I have realized I'm the punching bag for her. Whenever she is upset, she hunts me down and yells/degrades me.  I have to go to therapy for a few reasons, but this is a big one.  I hope she loves me back, but she surely doesn't show it how I would assume someone should?  She is easily stressed over the tiniest things. My therapist says she isn't going to change.  And I know that. But it's so hard to deal with this so often. Her mood changes from happy mom to ready to yell out her lungs so she feels better. I just, dont get what can cause her so much anger towards me. I have a job, I do my schoolwork, I help around the house. I do whatever she asks.  And I cant lie, in the past, I was pretty terrible. I was extremely suicidal and just wanted to leave this life.  (Not thinking like that anymore, thankfully.) I mean, I was a real pain in the ass.  I changed. But she seems incapable of changing. She doesn't want to.  And that is so shitty for me, you know? I just want to know how to deal.with a ticking timebomb. I'm sorry if this post was a downer, but I really do need some advice from others.  :(",06Sep2019,1

4,"I feel like I have tried everything.

I've taken 9 medications, gone to 6 therapists (long-term ones), I go to the gym every day, I try to socialise as much as I can (tough when I have an unlikable personality + apparent inability to change it), I read self-help books and mental health related stuff, I try to meditate, I try to eat well and sleep well (and fail, but I try my best), I take care of my appearance the best I can (doesn't help much though...), I dress as nicely as I can, I try to experience as much as I can (again, hard when nobody likes you enough to want to go out places with you), I try to form relationships with others, I try really hard in school, I have a job that I try to make the most out of, I even ask on bloody reddit looking for advice, but every day I still feel worse and worse, I lose a little bit more control over my mind and my emotions, I get closer to offing myself, my mental state as a whole decays slowly but inevitably. Can't control my thoughts or my emotions, nobody ever likes me (romantically or platonically), I fail at everything I try, I have no good prospects, you name it I'm doing badly at it.

I don't know what to do, I've tried my best but nothing's working, I've done everything I can but I'm just getting worse. I don't want to be like this, I want to be happy and to be able to form meaningful relationships. I want to be held and loved and accepted and to be successful and to look good and to not want to die but I don't know what else there is to try. They won't give me electroconvulsive therapy or TMS, IDK why, they just say it's not right for me.

I know my biggest expense is convenient food - delivery or grabbing something on campus. Despite this I keep overdoing it and I’m pretty sure it’s mostly because my depression is hitting me really hard again. I exhausted almost all of my savings getting back to an ok mental place last year, so now I’m low on money and I’m still struggling a lot. I get stressed, depressed, and then order food to make myself feel better/make sure I eat at at all.

I have a big ego, yet have little self confidence and a lot of self-doubt. 

I hold people and society in contempt and isolate myself. I obviously experience anxiety and depression because of this.

I experience self destructive behavior, I don’t hurt myself or have a substance abuse issue, but I don’t do anything to address this issue, like there’s a part of me that wants this, it’s how I’ve been most of my life.

I’m almost certain this is because of my dad neglecting me who was the same way. He died when I was 18 also. 

Am I past the point of no return? How do I fall in love with life again, accept reality? I know this is not the real me. I want to have meaningful relationships again, and accept society.

14,"I have had bad dreams all my life. Around 14 years old, I was told by a therapist that I have Night Terrors. I have nightmares a few times a week,  ranging from bad memories (childhood thru adulthood) to things like being buried, falling, choking, burned alive, me or a loved one dying/die. Sometimes, I'll wake up twitching, yelling, gasping for air, or just open my eyes and can't move. Sometimes, my nose will bleed or I'll get sick to my stomach. I used to manage it by taking my medication and smoking weed. I haven't done either of those things in almost 5 years, my partner isn't fully supportive of that ""lifestyle"". I'm trying to find new way to manage them, sleep therapy and such. The main thing I hate about my bad dreams is that they make me feel afraid to sleep, I wake up frequently, and I get more emotional. I do have some mental illness's and being sleep deprived, just makes them go out of control sometimes.Any tips on how to fix it or manage it?

16,"Recently I realized that a part of what is holding me back is my current situation. I live with a roommate. Do not get me wrong. I love my roommate. But he only works 3 days a week. I do not work because of mental and physical health. My energy spikes are pretty random. And so is my pain and anxiety.  However I still have energy at times that I need to release. And I am pretty random. So I release my energy in many different ways. And I do it based on how I feel. The ways I release this energy is by making art, dancing, exercising, etc.. Sometimes that is hard to do because I live in a small apartment with my roommate. He often likes peace and quiet to concentrate. And I am a creature of chaos and randomness. So I end up feeling suppressed trying to respect my roommate. Then I feel irritable and frustrated. This is not good for me, or my roommate. So I am trying to find solutions. I am limited in money. So I can not afford to go to a gym or else I would. I also live in the city. So going. Out to exercise just makes me feel overwhelmed because of my social anxiety. I would love to take dance classes when I am in good health and have the energy. But again limited funds. And I wish I had my own space to make art in piece and quiet. Whenever he is gone I try to focus on my art and getting my energy out however I want. But that is not alway convenient or helpful since again my energy is so random. I can not control when I am in the mood to make art, exercise, or do anything else. I can not control when I have energy because I have cerebral palsy and that will not go away. So sometimes I really want to play music and do art on Tuesday when he is home. But I can’t because that would annoy him and keep him from getting work done on the computer. So instead I do nothing and I feel frustrated. I have tried using headphones and ignoring the fact that he is around. But I feel suppressed. And I do not want to have to wear headphones. I also can not really dance or exercise in the apartment because it is so small. And when he is here he might get in my way. For a long time I just kept these feelings to myself because I do not want to bother him. But we are different people. Even if we love and respect each other, and are like family. I need more breathing room. But I do not want to be a burden. I do plan on bringing this up. But there is no easy solution. I do not think I can live alone because I would get to lonely. But I also want more space and time to myself. I feel like sometimes I get pent up energy and I want to be destructive or express my frustration in harmful ways to myself mostly. And I do not want to do that because I regret it later on and feel bad. I do see a therapist. So please do not tell me to see a therapist. I want to know what others think. my therapist is away for the week. So have not talked to them about this yet. But I will.",06Sep2019,1
17,"I know this is kind of a stupid question but I really like posting to reddit and getting a lot of different perspectives. I am also completely oblivious to what one does to verify said illnesses and what steps are taken from there.

I am a 26 year old male. The last couple years I have started to suspect that something is not right in my head. I have always been a supporter of the growing mental health awareness in the world,  but in my head I was never one of those people afflicted by it. I grew up almost completely ignorant to mental health. 

Thinking back I don’t think I’ve ever had one discussion about it with my parents or ever hearing of anyone in my family learning they have a mental illness. I am a well adjusted person and have always been very polite so I don’t think my parents had any reason to suspect I should be looked at. Or if they were suspicious it was something so minor it may have felt better to just not confront it rather than put that label on their sons identity.

I highly suspect I have some mild form of ocd and bi polar. I’m not an explosive bi polar but there are days where life is amazing for no reason I just feel good about everything. Then there’s days where I fixate on negatives and let stupid things ruin my day. I usually internalize this. Coincidentally I read about existential ocd and was like “oh. I have this.” And since I’ve thought about it more I realized there are normal everyday things I absolutely fixate on. I slightly think I could have aspergers but I don’t really know enough about it to give a solid argument.

Anyways, I have some issues that need to be addressed. I thought I could just muscle through it and solve it internally but it I have been more depressed and anxious lately and I think I need to know what I’m dealing with so I can try and resolve these feelings.

Are there specific doctors or therapists I should be going to about this? How expensive is treatment? Should I be considering meds? Any alternative fixes? Anyone willing to give any bit of information or personal experience would be really appreciated. Really I am just so clueless about this it’s embarrassing.I have only come to terms with this in the past week or so and it is a bit scary.

18,"Recently a police investigation had to happen where I had to recount my sexual assault and other things I didn’t want my mother to know but since I’m a minor she has to know.  She found out and told my dad and grandma and they put restrictions on me. 

Ever since I’m investigation I’ve gotten sad by everything, angry pretty easily, and then I just full on shut down and show no emotion. This happens a lot

I’m thinking this is a response to the whole investigation and having to re-live the whole sexual assault and other stuff that happened that I didn’t really every try to process and I just swept under the rug. 

Some example of me getting angry was when my dad called my hamster a mouse and I wanted to take it out to show him the differences and he told me to leave it alone and I took that and I’m not responsible enough and that I an idiot then I got angry 

A time I just shut down was when my mom spoke about the investigation I refused to give more than one word answers in a expressionless voice. 

A time I got sad when I some guy I was talking to started being dry and I took that as something completely different than it was and I just started to think all these awful things of myself and reasons why he wouldn’t want to talk to me and then I started to believe them and I got sad

19,"Hey Guys, these past few weeks I’ve been putting some proper thought into how I think, and more specifically what certain kind of thinking does to confidence, personality etc. I’ve had problems with self confidence anxiety and depression before but there’s a certain pattern (that I’d describe as some sort of vicious cycle) I’ve seen emerge that I can’t quite get my head around and it goes something like this- 

I’ll be perfectly normal, talking normally and acting fine, then something I perceive as negative will happen, small or big (9/10 It’s nothing important, it’s small and insignificant events in retrospect) and my whole personality will change. I’ll start thinking negatively (thoughts of worthlessness, anger, intense sadness, paranoia) which causes a chain reaction through my body (tiredness, drained of energy, not able to speak or react, no emotions) and this can last for hours and hours. 

Normally after about 3-4 hours this passes, and the newfound confidence and happiness from this ending will change my personality again (cocky, happy, outgoing, confident) and this will last for about the same time scale. What changes this is that I’ll perceive something going wrong when I’m in this state as other people’s reactions to me being cocky or overly confident (my perception of this is not knowing how cocky or annoying I may be) and this will put me right back into the first phase of this cycle. 

This odd sequence of events can last for days and days and usually only ends with me shutting myself off from human contact and, in a way, trying to just forget about it. It’s harmful in relation to mental state as for as long as I’ve had a conscience I’ve been overly paranoid about how other people feel and their opinions of me and how I act. This annoying cycle can be harmful to daily routines, my job, interacting with friends and family, as well as making it hard to raise self confidence and self image. 

I’m so sorry if this is just a normal mood swing kind of thing or something that everyone suffers from, I’m probably just overreacting, but any help on identifying this problem or what it might be would be fantastic, it could be the start of fixing a wider problem or opening a more significant number of problems. 

Thank you very much guys x",06Sep2019,1

Now, I feel like it works but I still get suicidal and intrusive thoughts sometimes. The second I get stressed, or something bothers me, my mind goes right to passive thoughts of suicide. If I feel like my medicine is working in all other aspects, could it be that the suicidal thinking is just an automatic thought pattern after years of being passively suicidal and constantly thinking about it?

I hate any touching from anyone older than me (not just a couple of years I mean like a generation older), especially family members.

Both of those make sense to me, because I really only enjoy or can stand touch from my best friends (2 or 3 people). I just wanted to get your opinions.

26,"One thing I seem to have gotten wrong from where I grew up to the city I live in now, is the assumption that being virtuous is in itself of value. One of the reasons I ended up going through a lot of trouble emotionally with a few acquaintances (that really hit me at a vulnerable spot and I shut down socially for 2 years straight) is my realization that what matters is not how good you are, but what you bring to the table.

The people who talked behind my back, and planned to exclude me from their circles were all being useful and helpful with each other - while I didn't bring as much to the table as they did. I was just too depressed to focus on anything except keeping myself afloat in my college program. Nobody has the fortitude to sink the small sliver of their freetime on a person who is a giant emotional sink. I wasn't that the whole time, I was kind and listened as often as I sought help. But most others didn't need \*any\* listening-to. They had plans, and plans are sexy.

Part of me feels sad, because one constant thing I remember doing when growing up is everyone being there for people who are hurting. And even when we made plans when they asked for space, we cared for them - and tried to check with them and make sure they were doing okay. Now, it seems that everyone prefers to be busy. And part of  being a practical person, is just taking care of stuff. Some people get left behind, it's not good economics to care for them. 

I'm beginning to appreciate boundaries. When I recover, and find my vitality back from this mess, I want to meet people where they are. I want to not trap them in the plans I make, instead looking after my own peace of mind - and taking care of my own enjoyment as I've always done. I'm not lonely, but I just miss people who didn't have plans - and who were okay with just sitting around and shooting bullshit. Everything is a planned, arranged affair. I like being productive when I'm working - during worktime. But when I'm unwinding, I wish I could just unwind and relax.

34,"I've been struggling with depression for about a year now. Looking back, it's definitely been longer, but about a year ago is when I acknowledged it as something I should get help for. Problem is, nothing's helping. I've tried six medications and two therapists, and the biggest positive change in my mood came from school ending, which would have naturally changed my mood by reducing stress anyways. I don't feel much of anything anymore, until I think about how *nothing* I feel and then cry about that. 

I stopped seeing any therapist back in June because I spent half my week dreading the next session and the other half angry about how the last one went, and I just haven't bothered to find anyone else. I've been seeing my doctor regularly for med checks, but when I tried to tell her I don't want to take any more medications, she practically begged me to try ""just one more"". That was two medications ago. On the latest one, she says I ""look brighter"" and that makes her confident it's starting to work, but I feel the same or worse, if anything. I asked my dad and he hasn't noticed a difference either.

I guess it boils down to me being tired of dealing with depression. I spent 18 years of my life believing this was just how life was, that I was a little lonely and a little stressed but otherwise normal. I miss that. I wish I'd never sought help in the first place—that I'd just kept pushing forward, because everything started going downhill the moment I said ""I think I have depression"" to someone. As long as I don't think about it, I'm functional enough, so I should just move on and live that way. Trying to help just makes me think about it, which makes me feel worse.

Therapy makes me feel awful about myself because I can't show any improvement. My therapist offered to find me someone else even before I decided to stop seeing her, which felt like she was saying she couldn't help me. I don't think I have it in me to try at therapy, so there's no point in going and wasting my time and theirs.

Medication is a constant reminder that there's something wrong with me. It sucks to wake up in the morning and the first thing I do is try to fix my fucked up brain. ""Good morning! You've never been truly happy! Have a nice day!""

I'm tired of seeking help. I probably need some intensive inpatient thing to really make any progress, and I've run out of time to do that, as I leave for college in less than two weeks. Why do I need to get help? Either my life will work out or it won't. I always had this strange feeling that I'm meant to die young anyways, but not in a suicidal way. I just simply cannot picture myself having a life beyond being 22ish? 25?

I don't know. I'm just tired of the people who are meant to be my ""support system"" making things worse.",06Sep2019,1

im extremely insecure about my appearance. i hate myself because im a lazy asshole and im way too impulsive (i called my teacher a pedophile just today on impulse for example lmao) my fuckin impulsivity has caused most of my anxiety, but because of the way my brain works i think that because i do dumb shit on impulse that im not being anxious about it im just thinking that i need to be better but i know i will never be better. im too lazy to be better and im too impulsive to not do dumb shit that gives me anxiety. 

im not even going to say that life is bad or anything because for me its not. i just cant feel emotions so im not happy or sad. i love being fucking numb.

38,"I will try to keep this brief even though it all began in 2017 after problems with co-workers. 

My current situation is terrible. I am a 25 year old male who lives with his mom and sees his dad every weekend. This is because my parents are divorced; however my dad recently met a woman who now frequently stays at his house.

Now I've been struggling with severe mental health issues for the past three years. I've had evidence of delusions and anxiety where I'm being persecuted by various individuals. Unfortunately, this situation at my dad's house has brought back these emotions to the point where I fear my life. Many nights I go without sleep and I feel like collapsing during their day, since my dad expects me to be there on the weekends, saying that he did the same with me in high school. 

In addition to this, I'm trying to keep my dad's relationship a secret from my mom because she has a history of not handling stress well. My mom is beginning to wonder why I'm in such a poor physical state and missing nights of sleep. I'd also like to add that my delusions are not only physical but includes the idea of people working together to cause me mental torment. One of the lesser delusions that has some validity is the idea of my dad seeking Justice for the ills done to him during his marriage. Since no other siblings are available and I'm the closest one, I fear that he escalates the tension with me so that I report back to my mother or suffer for my own wrongdoings that I may have committed over the years.

As I said, the woman my dad sees appears nice, but I have a suspicions that she doesn't like me and believes I'm only nice to her when my dad is around. This thought process has led to poison delusions which resulted in 4 days without sleep. After this event, I refused to do things with my dad for a couple days, blaming my insomnia and being too tired, however, he was largely unsympathetic since he thought I was betraying his loyalty. This makes me angry because he labels me as a petty person for acting this way when I genuinely had a crisis. 

For clarity, let it be known that I'm a logical person whom people ask for advice. But also understand that I am mentally ill and struggling to release myself from this place. I understand that I have delusions but there still remains a possibility that one of these is right which can cause serious consequences.

I am looking for advice on what I should do. Thank you for the support.",06Sep2019,1
39,"I’m about to turn 17 and I’m in high school still. Ever since I was a kid I’ve had pretty bad anxiety but when I got into high school it got a lot worse which I believe happens to everybody. The problem is that it’s become almost debilitating. I was diagnosed with a functional bowel disorder last year which might seem unrelated but it’s the first sign things are going bad as my stomach starts hurting and aching to the point where I don’t know if I can keep anything down. I usually don’t eat at school either as it just hurts too much to do so. Now when it gets really bad I sort of have a type of anxiety attack. It builds up very slow but over time it goes from “I need to run and get out of here” to a sort of completely numb feeling where I can’t feel any emotions. A lot of times it almost feels like nothing is real as if I’m just a set of eyes observing from the outside. A lot of times I’ll just look around because everything feels and looks so weird. Sometimes if I get to this weird “numb” state I’ll just be shaking during all of it. Like my body will just be almost shivering and it can come in waves for hours on end. It’s a living hell when it happens. A few days ago I had it happen and it lasted 2-3 hours coming in waves with gaps of 10-20 minutes or so. I don’t know what it is but I’m struggling to stay motivated. For the first 4 periods of the day I didn’t do any work and my grades are dropping and I’m usually a straight A student. I just stared at a wall or my paper not acknowledging anyone for the whole class period while I felt almost nothing emotionally and I was just shaking. I don’t know what this is either. I’ve realized that there’s one trigger that makes it worse than all the others but I’m honestly too embarrassed to share it here because it’s silly and not rational. 

I’m going to doctor tomorrow but I’m worried that they won’t be able to diagnose me or maybe that since I’m still a teenager they won’t give me anything that will actually work on me or maybe just blow it off as me being a teenager.  I can usually function just fine outside of school unless the trigger arises or is brought up. Of course many things can start it but I’ve realized there’s one thing that brings it up more than others. Not sure if that’s at all relevant or not. My worst fear is that they’ll tell me nothing is wrong with me and then I won’t get treatment and they might send me to therapy which may work in the long run but I need a solution now. It isn’t worth living like this. Not suicidal but I don’t know how much longer I can do this. 

I self medicated with marijuana for a few weeks a while ago and it helped so much. I could focus on the important things because I wasn’t having these episode whenever I went to school. I can’t take that anymore however since my parents found out and don’t want me self medicating with it and it’s probably for the better. Just worried that the doctor won’t prescribe anything to help me because of my age and maybe other factors. Maybe I’m worrying too much but I really need some relief from this soon. Any ideas on what this is or maybe what I can except from my appointment tomorrow. Thanks guys!",06Sep2019,7
40,"**TW:** Mention of abuse and self-harm

I’m a 16 year old female living in the USA.  For the past 1 and 1/2 years, I’ve seriously been struggling with mental health problems.  Here recently, it’s gotten so bad I’m scared about what I’m going to do.

I recently moved into a boarding school, a good one at that.  My mom and stepdad are about 2-4 hours away, so I don’t usually go home other than the one weekend a month and vacations.

I mainly came here to escape from my mom, who can seriously be very mentally and emotionally abusive to me, that’s at least what my boyfriend says she is.  She’s overbearing, controlling, manipulative, and tries to live through me.  I feel scared to even be around her, since she’s even hit me several times before.  Though she never leaves any marks and it’s only happened once or twice.  Even though I don’t see or talk to her much anymore, the problems really haven’t gone away.

For most of the past 1 and 1/2 years, I’ve been dealing with that I assume to be anxiety, depression, and **maybe** OCD.  My mom, however, doesn’t believe in this and refuses to get me checked out.  I’ve had to hide it from her and everyone in my life, in fear that she’ll take everything away from me.

My self image is in tatters, my confidence is practically non-existent, I have serious trust issues, I stress about everything, I have to have everything be a certain way, I have really dark thoughts, and have even harmed myself during one of my breakdowns.

I hate to admit it but most of the worst has been happening within the past month.  I have no idea what to do and I’m scared to tell anyone in my real life.

My boyfriend of year now has been really supportive, and has offered me to move away with him since he’s far away from my family and my state.  However, that would be two years from now.  I don’t know what I can or should do til then, but I seriously feel like I need help.  I feel trapped and I can’t figure out what to do.  I can’t let my mom find out or she’s going to take my boyfriend, my school, and everything away from me.

Is there anything I can do?  I really need help.",06Sep2019,1
41,"Hey guys,

I've been thinking about posting on here for a while and decided to finally do it. A bit of background first. For the last 4 years or so I've been struggling with reality disassociation. Not saying I don't believe any of this isn't real, it's more that I'm scared all of this might not be real, or that eventually one day I will fully lose touch. It's always affected me and has been coming in waves. The best way i can discribe it, is that my head feels conjested like its not processing whats going on around me. Sometimes theres panic attacks and sometimes it just makes me feel depressed.

But lately, ive felt really burnt out and really sick from it, and this hasn't happened before. I've never met anyone else with this issue and was hoping someone out there feels the same or has amy advice. Or if someone could even just point me to some article that says ""hey you're not fucking crazy and its impossible to become crazy from this"". Just any advice or insight would be nice, I'm getting sick of listing to my own thoughts.

42,"So I'll start this off by saying I haven't been properly diagnosed with anything but I've done research and I'm pretty sure I have some form of ADD/ADHD, along with social anxiety, and a few learning... blocks? (I don't know what exactly you'd call them)

I just don't know how to bring it up to anyone, mainly since I hate talking about my problems, physically or mental cause I just feel like I'd be burdening people, so much so I'm hesitant to even post this. Because of this I think that they most likely would think I'm being very odd, since I've never talked to them about this kinda thing, and they might not believe me. So I don't know what to do.

P.S I also have this thing where i hate being touched by anyone, even family, I did a bit of research on that and all I could find was haphephobia and variations on it, which I don't think is it cause I don't have a fear of being touched, I just hate the feeling of people touching me, any thoughts?",06Sep2019,1
43,"I've had this since I was 13. I am 16 now and I am having trouble staying happy. Don't get me wrong I think I am happy most of the day but when I look at something happy/cute it somehow brings up sadness in me. It someway makes me realize that someone in this exact moment is dying, is sad, or contemplating suicide. Example : I am happy in the morning. I reach in my pocket for a pack of tissues. There's a happy tear on the cover and says ""No more tears"". This makes me sad for some reason.

44,"I don’t officially have a mental illness diagnosis but for the past few years I haven’t been doing very well mentally. school has been hard to deal with mentally and I don’t have a great relationship with my dad so in the last few years life has been hard to deal with. 

lately i’ve been getting worse and some extra unusual things have been happening to me:
- i went from having an extremely happy productive few days where i wanted to clean everything in my house and was unusually joyful 
- however in a few days i became super sad and felt no motivation to do anything, i didn’t want to sleep or eat or even go on my phone everything seemed exhausting and i just didn’t want to do anything. 
- i’ve had a few times where i feel like i’m dreaming or if i become aware of reality and i start to question whether i’m real or not. everything basically feels fake and i get really numb (pain is super dulled when this happens) 
- i have become super paranoid, for instance, when i’m in the shower i have to check often to make sure no one is in the bathroom ready to hurt me. 
- sometimes when i look in mirrors i don’t recognize myself and it looks like a different person. sometimes it gets so bad that i’m afraid that the person in the mirror is going to hurt me. 
- one night i saw my eyes get bigger in the mirror, they grew in size right as i watched (this may have been sleep deprivation) 
- i’ve found it difficult to sleep, but i’m often so tired in the afternoon i cannot stay awake
- and lastly this is probably the weirdest and most scary, i one night continuously felt bugs crawling over my face, arms, and legs. however when i looked for them i couldn’t find them, sometimes i could even see nothing on my arm as i could feel something crawling there. that same night i continuously woke up due to intense nightmares. the next night i felt some crawling but a lot less 
i figured i was imagining bugs although tonight i went into my room and found 3 spiders. i flipped out and now i’m not so sure if the bugs were imagined. then as i was standing in my room i kept feeling bugs crawl over my legs and feet despite nothing there. and now that i’ve left my room i still occasionally feel the sensation of crawling. this is really confusing and i’m not sure if i imagined all of the bugs or some of them and i’m scared. 
sorry this was so long but i’m not sure what’s going on and i’m wondering if anyone has experienced something similar or has any advice. thanks",06Sep2019,1

At first I thought it was just some weird thing that was wrong with me, but I saw a post on a reddit compilation video where someone said this exact thing.

46,"So, I've always had a little bit of anxiety and a fear of open spaces and kind of always feeling the need for control (hate flying because I can't just get out of the plane or something like that), and I have struggled with depressive episodes, but that usually happens when I don't have anything to keep me busy that feels worthwhile (my job can come with a lot of down time) but all of that has always manifested itself into what I call ""Body anxiety"" like where your heart races and it may be hard to swallow or something like that.

 But a couple months ago I had a thought that just made me snap and even though I haven't been as bad as the first day after the thought (which was easily the worst mental health day of my life) it's still been awful. It was completely ruinous to my life and who I was before it happened. My fiancee and I were just driving to the beach, our conversation had ended and we were just listening to music, thinking. Nothing out of the ordinary, when suddenly I became very cognizant of my own thought, and how I can't really escape my own mind and I just snapped. 

If I'm trying to paint a mental image, it's like my mind sort of inverted on itself, and kept doing so, like a kaleidescope, and the thoughts felt infinite but inescapable. I started cussing and my fiancee thought I was just nervous about the planes (cuz I also just dislike airports. Loud noises have also never been great for me. Flying is just a miserable experience all around) but I had to shush her and was just having a panic attack, but like I've never experienced before. It's what I call ""Mind anxiety."" I got through it in a minute or so and we went to the beach and I was relatively okay, but it was still in the back of my mind. 

Then the next day, when she was back at work and I was home I just couldn't for the life of me stop thinking about being trapped in my own mind and I was  freaking out and had to text her just to tell her I was having a rough day, I tried working out but it didn't work, so I was just pacing around my apartment, curling up on the bed then sitting on my knees and just laying my head on the couch. Anything just trying to put my thoughts elsewhere. 

Now, I can hardly sleep because I'm so lost in my mind. My guard is constantly up. I used to be able to meditate and kind of put the ""Body anxiety"" at ease, but now I can't because as soon as I kind of have a thought outside myself it's like I jolt, go on the defense and have to snap back. I'm afraid of any situation where I'll have to think and can't distract myself, like movie theaters or long car rides (both things I used to love) and my fear of open spaces has increased like ten fold to where if I'm even near one I damn near feel like I'm about to shoot straight off the planet and can even have trouble standing straight up. 

Just typing that now made me feel almost panicked. I even find myself happy when I just have ""Body anxiety"" because it feels easy. I know panic attacks can't hurt me and if I just allow myself to feel it, let myself feel the worry, it'll pass and I'll be fine. But this mind stuff feels unshakeable and like there's no escaping it and I'm honestly angry I even had the thought because it was so simple and came out of nowhere and has just brought down everything. There's nothing I've done that helps it for more than a few minutes, and of course some days are worse than others. CBD oil can help a little, but not much, it mostly helps sleeping. I also find that even in conversation I can be talking to someone and engaged in their conversation, but still feel my mind tugging on the background, still thinking about my own thought. I don't actively avoid anxious situations cuz I think that would be worse, but some days are harder than others.  Just not really sure what to so, I'm just worried this is how the rest of my life will be.",06Sep2019,1

Just by the way the female stranger can make herself appear on her social media which is unrealistic in real life.

I can't be on Facebook anymore, because anytime a FEMALE (Couldn't care less for anonymous male accounts) But when a Stranger Female Account, Laugh/Reacts or Comments something sexually oriented/related, the natural chemical reaction my brain produces is beyond a horribly unpleasant psychological feeling.  

It is female accounts on social media I DON'T KNOW, That have been the identified source of these serious such unpleasant emotions, the negative ""train of thought"", usually consisting of falling in love with a woman who called me a say a rude name like or whatever she called me online, whether it be over a typo, misunderstanding a controversial opinion-based situation politically or ethically.  

Here is the positive.

I may SOUND crazy, yes. However, I'm really trying to make the best out of my life and realized I cannot afford a romantic/serious relationship with ANYONE. 

I shouldn't feel the need to attempt to talk or make sexual connections with those who ridicule or even humiliate me to an extent. 

After I turned 24 two months ago, I made the decision to give up on problematic substance use, such as Cannabis and Alcohol, I now weight train as a productive alternative considering No one will hire me either after I handed in 20+ resumes and cover letter around town with 7+ years experience in the Restaurant Industry.

My tolerance to legal substances (such as Alcohol or Cannabis), went down huge after cutting back on my habits.

It is very tough dealing with mental health issues, My family told me no matter what the prettiest girl says online to you that maybe insulting, That could be just her natural type where she'll speak her mind, meaning that no matter what I say or who I try and agree with or reason with you cannot please everyone. 

I don't want a girlfriend ever. Never have, Never Will. I also suffer from Mild Autism.

I understand this but I have always wondered why people react the way they do when something happens. I witness people crying and experiencing happiness and I can’t understand it. The only things I’ve cried for are myself because I felt like it was right to do. I enjoy getting reactions out of people and seeing them in a state of panic/emotional distress. I don’t remember my childhood very well but I do remember my father leaving me and how I would fight my mom, sisters, and brothers because they got in my way. I had a very short temper and would go into rage and often was beat for it. I remember how I wanted to get revenge by murdering my family.

I can't say this is bad but he didnt let me finish.

I don’t want to think these thoughts, but can’t stop them. If I occupy myself to where my mind doesn’t drift, I’ll be alright. 

But sometimes I get triggered and I’m filled with grief and anxiety, like yesterday I watched the remake of IT, and the scene with SPOILER AHEAD, 














Georgie getting his arm ripped off by Pennywise. When I first saw it I immediately thought about my son. I have not been able to go more than 4 hours without it popping up in my head, and it’s like getting punched in the gut.

65,"I feel like I've hit a point over the past couple of days where my depression seems to just be impacting me even more that it usually does. I have anxiety as well, but that's not as prominent over the past couple of days. This is slightly a rant and slightly me asking for advice.

Along with my depression and anxiety, I have a chronic illness that I've only recently been able to see a specialist for. With all three mixed together, I have a hard time getting a job or feeling like I can handle it. At my last two jobs, I've had bad anxiety with both. My most recent one was putting so much stress and anxiety that I was having panic attacks at least twice a week. 

I'm 25 and currently living with my parents and my sister, but a big part of my depression is the feeling that I'm disappointing and useless because I don't have a job. It's not that I don't want my own money and my own way of helping out financially, but I'm not in a place to put myself into a job that I know will make my anxiety like it was at my last job. 

My mom is the one who likes to bring it up and I feel most impacted by her opinion and my sister's. Usually it'll just give me a couple hours of feeling bad, but for the past couple days I've just felt miserable, unwanted and like a disappointment. Currently, I'm in a program that is meant to help people with disabilities find work or go to school, but I'm on a waiting list. Chances are, it'll take awhile until I even get called in, potentially a year.

Everything is alright and my mom apologized and said she cries herself to sleep a lot because of what she did to us. 

I’ve had depression on and off since the age of fourteen, and recently took on anxiety. The depression affects my life and I’m tired of it, I’ve given up on things like school and so many jobs because of it, or I randomly lose motivation and I don’t know why. 

I’ve been getting random sharp pains/pressures throughout my body and they disappear in one or two seconds flat, I’ve also gotten random high pitched noises in my ear and I don’t know why, I’ve searched it up and apparently they’re caused by severe anxiety, I really want these to go away and I don’t want to take medication,

 My sister (19) has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and add, she used to cope with it by taking drugs and alcohol, I’m very mild mannered and have never done drugs or alcohol despite my friends and family doing them and pressuring me to do so, I’m scared I’ll turn out like my mom and beat my kids, I haven’t had any violent outbreaks though and I think I’m normal in that sense but I don’t know what to do, I’m fine at the moment but I’m afraid that I’ll quit out on school again because of the chronic depression or something.

Also, my sisters dad is still in her life and tasks to her regularly, my dad doesn’t even send me Christmas wishes or acknowledges my birthday, his now-wife asked me to move on with them a while back and I think it had nothing to do with that douchebag father of mine, I envy children that play with their dads and it affects me a lot.",06Sep2019,2

The paper work was also too confusing and I needed to walk out as I was about to cry and have a panic attack. They said that they would help with the paperwork and I need to “deal with it”. 

They then said that my appointment would be too late anyway and to just go home. There was one other person in the office that had a follow up appointment and I asked if he could just go first and they said no and that I messed everything up.  I asked if I could just have a phone interview because I was leaving abroad to go to school, I have told them the date that I was leaving multiple times, and then the scheduled it early in the morning the same day that I leave and they said “oh too bad, if you really need it then you’ll come” and I asked if they can call me if there’s any cancelations and they said “no, if you need help then just talk to your GP or just go to an urgent care because we can’t help you anymore”

74,"So I have been depressed since 8th grade (2010) I was never diagnosed or anything, and I never really told anybody about it. In Highschool I missed a lot of school because just thinking about having to get our of bed and deal with anything made me wanna cry. This lead to a lot of fights with my mom who just thought I was lazy. After I graduated Highschool (2015) it got worse. I didn't go to college and I didn't get a job. I kinda just became a hermit. I lived with my parents and they paid for food for me and everything which I feel really guilty about. Anyway I finally started seeing a therapist earlier this year and that was the first time I told anybody I had been depressed. A few weeks ago I started 3 college classes, I dropped one cause I was feeling really overwhelmed and I was looking for a job as well. I just got hired this week and am feeling really overwhelmed again. I feel like my depression hasn't gotten better and I honestly feel like I'm breaking. I don't know what to do. I don't know if I'm just overreacting, or if I'm just overwhelmed because I just started school and am gonna start my first job soon, or if it is actually all too much for me right now. Every since I started school I have had a lot more anxiety and I'm worried I'm just gonna break down. Every time I go to my therapist it just feels like we say the same thing and I don't know if it's helping anymore. On one hand I think it is cause I finally went and got a job and started school, but on the other hand I don't feel any better. Maybe I just had to high of hopes when I decided to go to therapy.

75,"Some context: I’m 24, female, anxiety and depression, with 3 brothers and 2 parents. My parents are fine, we just aren’t close in a “loving” way. I know we love each other, but we haven’t said it to each other since I was probably about 10, and I haven’t hugged them since I was probably about 5 – the thought of doing these things it really awkward and panics me in my head. It’s weird. We use humour to cover a lot of things and never talk about anything deep, I can’t imagine ever telling them I have anxiety and depression and am on medication and seeing a psychologist, despite really wanting to so they can understand me better. 

Anyway, that was just for context and not the main issue. Ever since primary school, I have been drawn to older females. Not in a sexual way, I just desperately want to be friends with them or have them like me, and for them to care for me. At the same time though, I have enough awareness to know how not to be “creepy” or too far, and so many times I did develop this relationship with someone older (they have all fizzled out now). There have been several older female figures in my life who I have been really close to and just crave their love and attention so much – I want them to care for me. I’m an adult now, and I still feel the same, but don’t seek anyone out, in school it was mainly teachers and youth leaders. Now I’m an adult, I still crave it, but don’t try and force it to happen with anyone, mainly because I’m so anxious I have no friends and barely go out lol, but I don’t think I do this because I’m lonely, in school I actually had friends and still did this.

I even obsessively watch TV shows or movies or read books with a female friendship like this, and rewatch episodes of the older female caring for and looking out for the younger female. I have dreams about some of the past older women who have been in my life caring for me as I go through something, and wake up sad that I’ll never have this. But after all this, I cringe thinking of any of it happening with my mum, and no it will never happen and do not want it to happen, but I seem to really want it with anyone else.

This is weird, right? Or is it normal? A bit too obsessive? Why do I crave this so much? I’m too embarrassed to mention this to my new psychologist, I even made a throwaway just to post this. What are the reasons I am being like this? How can I fix it? And is anyone else like this?

Unfortunately, this has lead me to not really having direction in life and feeling sort of lost in a way. Fortunately for me, I've found someone special who is trying their best to help me find me and what I enjoy in life, but I still struggle finding things or understanding my feelings about what I find.

I know it's apathy towards myself, and potentially dissociation, but this self-reflection and exploration has stirred up some feelings I've had periodically throughout my life about myself. These feelings alternate between causing me deep numbness and sometimes serious pain, and I don't know what they mean or how to address them. 

I'm unsure of if I'd be happier as the opposite gender, and a therapist I talked to said it could be either a cause of or symptom from depression. I know emotions are complicated and varry from person to person, but it's hard to compare how I feel about that to how others felt because I don't understand how I feel.

So I had a dream he was back. My family was so happy . I walked up called him a shitty dad and an abuser. And he comes back a lot in my dreams but usually he leaves after I yell at him but not this time. He stayed... He yelled in my face and tried to hit me. I thought I forgot what he looked like angry but I deffenetly remember now. I yelled at him blocked his arms. And started calling 911. He tried to take the phone and my family was trying to stop me.

85,"Since the start of High school(I’m a junior in college now) I’ve felt like I have some sort of minor depression with additional symptoms. I don’t get so debilitated that I skip work and can’t get out of bed.  But I’ve lost interest in almost all the hobbies I had and can’t seem to put interest and dedication into anything else.  I have about 1 good friend who is also my ex which is an odd situation that I’m not sure helps me although she is a great person that would do anything for me.  But there’s a handful of people I would probably call friends on my good days. However overall they are what has caused me to start my mentally rough days over the last year.  They are my 3 roommates. 
They genuinely don’t seem to give a shit about me, or really anyone other than themselves.  I’ve confronted them several times before about stuff they do that makes me feel shitty and sad but they gaslight and tell me “no we don’t have a group chat without you”, “we only hung out without you because x” and they will also completely ignore my other claims of things they’ve done. My ex used to be friends with them and they did the same sort of stuff. But they continue to pretend they aren’t doing stuff behind my back even though they know I get sad.  However they always like to act like I’m equally important and appreciated in the group whenever I ask or am around. 
I had a great day yesterday, I won football game tickets at work and was feeling really great. But by the evening time (from about 6:30-10:30ish everyone stayed in their rooms and basically made no noise. Normally they hang out downstairs. I eventually get a text asking if it’s cool if they throw a Halloween party at the house in October and it upset because they had to “invite me” to a party at my house and they basically planned the whole party and invited everyone else before they asked me.  Anyway, I wake up this morning and wake up to social media posts about my apartment and basically photos of the fun times, and I wasn’t in a single photo or video but everyone else was.  I just feel like they wait until I’m not around to do things. 
I know this post is a huge ramble, but I just want to know why I fall into these cycles. I have one good day. 2-3 days or more of depressive and hopeless days. Then a few days of just going through the motions of my life. And finally I might have another good day which seems to be gone in an instant. 
I just don’t know what’s wrong with me, I’m suspicious everyone is up against me and hates me and does everything behind my back. I become hopeless about the future and normally lose energy where if I lay or sit down I won’t get up for 30 minutes to 2 hours if I don’t have something urgent to do even if there’s things I casually need to get done. I went to a college counselor once but they basically said I didn’t have anything. But if I don’t, that’s even more sad because I’d be perfectly normal and still find very little joy in life.

86,"Hi reddit.

I'll make this simple, I've been dealing with anxiety over my SO's feelings about me and my ability to solve a big problem -- I was accused of being intimdating and threatening by our shared apartment's office staff -- which then spiraled out of control and is a mad scramble to gain ground.  Between myself and SOs family not getting along, the issue above, and my anxiety, there is a lot of pressure on her from many sources.

I'm offering and trying everything I know to do to make this situation better, if not reverse it.  My SOs family is not very receptive of my efforts thus far and speaking to SO about the situation is difficult -- SO has requested that I not talk about it, and I am doing my best to respect her wishes.

All I want from this is to make things better for my SO, to stop smothering them with my anxiety, and to do everything I can to keep her in my life and out of harm's way.

So, getting to the point, how do I stop smothering my SO with my anxious thoughts on everything and just the overall seriousness of the situation? I'm so sick of hurting her when I don't intended to.",06Sep2019,2

89,"Something is wrong with me. 

I let things affect me too much. I get too attached. I over think and analyse everything and ruin everything good in my life.

My anxiety and insecurities self destructed a relationship with someone I felt stronger for anyone ever before. 

He dumped me and I think I pushed him right into the arms of the woman I was worried about when we were together. That's breaking me. It's breaking me because I don't think I'll ever know if its true or not. I just want answers. So I can find peace internally 'cause right now I'm losing my mind thinking about the various scenarios and the whys, hows, whens and whats of it all. 

I've literally done no work all morning. Just been watching my emails pile up, knowing full well I'm already having performance issues at work and yet I can't seem to focus on it. Part of me just wants to get up and walk out.

The only person who I think is there for me I don't want to reach out to right now because I've been bombarding her with my shit for weeks now and feel like a a needy self-centred pest. 

It's not all on me I know that. It's what was meant to happen. We just kept arguing and we were both suffering mentally from it all. 

I just don't know what to do now. He dumped me, then told me to give him time to sort out his life and he'll contact me next week. Text me in the middle of the night two days later telling me he loves and misses me but at this point it's all 'too much and it's breaking his heart'. Breaking his heart..? Breaking his fucking heart!? I am broken right now and he did this to me. He's fucked with my head. I simply don't know what he wants or what's going on in his head. He's not told me. Not once. 

He begged me to open up and be vulnerable to him, promised he wouldn't hurt me, and assured me he'd be patient and understanding because I knew I was super paranoid. And when I finally submitted and he finally got to see just what I meant when I said I was 'not ready to be in a relationship before I met you'.. he proceeded to leave me when I was acting out because I am 'too much'. And commence no contact. How is that fair? 

How can he claim to love and care about me and do this? I am fighting off the urge to show up at his door later and just plead and beg him to please talk/fight this out with me. Because I already felt like he never cared and if he can just throw me out his life like this without so much as giving me a sincere apology and conversation about it all then obviously he never did. And that just makes this heartache worse.. 

I accept that we're not good for each other. All I want is closure, for us both to talk it out, understand where we didn't work and go our separate ways in peace so that moving on might be easier. 

I just feel like no one cares for me like I care for others in my life and it's really getting to me. When is someone going to show me the same empathy and understanding I show others..  

The person who claimed to love me built me up, broke me down and left without so much as a proper goodbye. And hasn't even bothered to check in. 

I've been checked on by one friend since it happened 5 days ago. 

I've been sat at work all morning in tears and no one has so much as noticed. 

My life has not been a walk in the park. I've always felt like the only person I'll ever truly have is myself.. I've issues opening to people and so have never been one to reach out for help or open up to people. The only person who I think really understands and makes me feel like I'm not just some self-pitying crazy bitch is my counsellor and he's left the charity last week and now I have to wait to be allocated to new one. 

I feel the worst that I have ever felt in my life and I am completely alone through it all. 

I think the only person who can help me through this has blocked me on social media and won't talk to me.

Someone please tell me it's going to be okay. This heartache will pass. I fucking hate myself and my life right now.",06Sep2019,3

I work at a really shitty company for shitty people who are incapable of competent leadership. They blatantly choose favorites and those who aren’t chosen are verbally and emotionally abused on a daily basis. 

I haven’t been able to do anything right in their eyes for 4 or so months now and am treated worse as the days go on. I’m constantly being told I’m ruining the company, my work isn’t good enough, I’m not good enough for my job, etc. Leadership blatantly ignores me and treats me like I’m lower than the scum on their shoes.  The 3 people in leadership would love nothing more than for me to quit, and I’m positive I’ll be the next lay off if there’s more budget cuts. 

This has really started affecting my mental health, and it’s starting to feel like working there is a life or death matter. I’ve never had such intense thoughts of wanting to die before and it scares me. 

I opened up to my husband about this last night and just felt guilty for burdening him with this. He’s scared for me too now and I hate that I’ve made him feel this way. He’s a mental health professional, so he really gets it, but I feel bad that he works with this all day and has to come home to it, too.

93,"Mental health at work is very much a hot topic. It’s safe to say that the subject of everyday mental health and wellbeing is being discussed more than ever, with initiatives such as Mental Health Awareness Week and #EndTheStigma often trending on social media. 

However, according to research from the Time to Change (TTC) campaign, 95% of employees who call in sick with stress still feel the need to give a different reason. The disconnect here is a significant one, and an issue that cannot be ignored. The statistics associated with mental health issues are certainly eye-opening: 

* Mental ill-health is the leading 	cause of sickness absence in the UK, costing an average of £1,035 	per employee per year
* Almost one in three people have experienced mental health issues while in employment
* 12.7% of all sickness absence days in the UK are attributed to mental health conditions  

With so many employees willing to disclose problems with mental health in these surveys, why would such a large majority choose not to tell their manager?   


The answer is the continued stigma surrounding mental health at work.   
  

**What is the stigma?** 

Stigma is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as “feelings of disapproval that people have about particular illnesses or ways of behaving”. The Cambridge English Dictionary goes further by stating that it is often unfair.   


Many employees are afraid that they will be judged negatively if they admit to having issues with their mental health.   


There are numerous case studies from employees who feel that their employer may believe they are less capable of doing their job by taking time off to look after their mental health.   


This could be anything from being overlooked for promotion, to a form of ‘positive discrimination’ where managers and colleagues start treating them differently - even if it is intended to be supportive.   


On the other hand, some employees report being excluded from workplace activities. Some colleagues may choose to ‘turn a blind eye’ to any issues, leading to sufferers feeling fear or shame.   


In many cases, employees find it much easier to give a false reason for their absence. The problem with this is that it only adds to the stigma and prevents solutions being found.

**Why does it happen?** 

The stigma is generally caused by a lack of knowledge about mental health. Years of misleading media reports have linked mental health issues such as schizophrenia with violence and instability. This misconception has perpetuated and still remains in the public consciousness today.   


In reality, people with schizophrenia are more likely to be the victims of violent crime than the perpetrators. There is also the view that people who suffer from depression and anxiety should just ‘pull themselves together’ or ‘cheer up’.   


Such views wouldn’t be tolerated if they were directed towards people with a physical condition. For example, it wouldn’t be acceptable to tell someone with cancer to just ‘get better’.   


These attitudes can be partially explained by the invisible nature of mental health; because people cannot immediately see the symptoms, they struggle to fully empathise with the condition without having experienced it themselves.   


Although there are lifestyle choices we can make to improve our mental condition, sometimes mental health problems can be unexpected and unavoidable – as with physical illnesses. This contradicts the misconception that having good mental health is simply a choice people make.   


The often competitive and profit-driven culture of workplaces can add to the stigma too. As shown by the earlier statistics, mental health issues are more common than many people think.   


This would normally allow a dialogue between colleagues and managers to take place, however a lack of trust in both job security and how others will react makes it difficult to truly be open. This adds to the stigma, making it a vicious cycle.   


Another misconception is that people with mental health issues cannot recover. In the world of business, this may lead to employers having an unconscious bias against employees they know have had mental ill health, choosing not to promote (or even hire) them.   


They may believe the employee will be absent for long periods of time or inevitably have to leave the organisation. This isn’t the case.   


**What is the law relating to mental health at work?**

The Equality Act 2010 states that it is against the law to discriminate against an individual because of a ‘protected characteristic’ such as gender, race or disability.   


Mental ill health counts as a disability if it has a substantially adverse and long-term effect on someone’s ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities. At work, this can include anything that prevents an employee doing their job, such as interacting with customers or colleagues.   


The 2017 abolition of legal fees for employment tribunal claims means employers who do not attempt to understand mental health may leave themselves open to challenges from employees who believe they have been discriminated against.   


This means that there is not only a moral obligation to look after mental health in the workplace, but a legal one too. This rightly serves as a reminder for employers to work towards ending the negative stigma attached to mental ill health.   
 

**What can be done to end the stigma?**

At the highest level, managers need to put policies in place that plainly state that discrimination of any kind is unacceptable. This way, employees will know what is and isn’t acceptable in the workplace regarding mental health, disability, or indeed any other subject. However, this alone is not enough.   


The best way to challenge misconceptions about mental health is by raising awareness. At work, this would be achieved through meaningful training for both managers and employees.   


Mental Health First Aid training is a highly effective way of doing this. This is often delivered as a short course one or two days course and will give attendees of all levels a deeper understanding of mental health and the factors that affect people’s wellbeing.   


What’s more, they’ll learn how to listen in a non-judgemental way and act as ‘mental health champions’ in their organisation, gauging how people are feeling by being able to spot tell-tale signs and knowing how to guide others to the best sources of support.   


Opening a dialogue gradually builds trust, which means that difficult topics can start to be broached. If someone is able to come to their manager during a performance review and tell them that they feel stressed or that their personal wellbeing could be better, then adjustments can be put in place to remedy this.   


There’s also the possibility that the actual phrase ‘mental health’ carries a stigma of its own. It was suggested to us that ‘integrated wellbeing’ was a good alternative.   


I feel this is a great idea, as it matches our belief that mental and physical health should be given the same weight. Perhaps only when that takes place can the stigma of mental health truly be removed from the workplace.

100,"Whether someone wants to commit suicide is their business, whether someone has threatened to hurt someone else is a matter of law enforcement, and whether someone “can take care for themselves” is not for the government to A). define and B). decide. 

The idea that simply because someone says they want to hurt *themselves,* the government takes their freedom away is so egregiously in violation of the spirit of America and our Constitution and our rights as Free Men, I don’t know how it happened. That the number of people “saved,” if any, as a result of this tyranny is *unknowable* doesn’t seem to matter. If it was high as the sky it wouldn’t justify it, not to me, and that it has been has opened a door to something worse. 

Last spring I was involuntarily committed. I essentially had a panic attack accompanied by OCD like tics and rituals (myclonic movements, rubbing my forehead, appearing to others as lost in thought). My mother called an ambulance and I consented because I thought it would be ok to talk to someone. (That’s how a lot of these stories start, family members, “concerned friends”—anyway)  Because of these tics, I was deemed “unable take care of myself.” They didn’t tell me this directly, it was decided I had to stay and there was nothing I could do. A 26 year old woman, not to mention verbally fluid and resistant woman, they had known for half an hour. My rights as a free citizen of the United States of America were STRIPPED from me on the basis my behavior was generally strange to them and they personally didn’t get it. YOU CANT TAKE SOMEONE’S FREEDOM AWAY BECAUSE THEY LOOK “WEIRD” TO YOU. I said, over and over. This is against my rights this is against the law. (“But *we* wouldn’t act like that !”) 

I’m 26, healthy, not a danger to myself or others, did not even express or display that.  What the hell is the government doing telling a 26 year old who is not a retard and has working limbs that she can’t fucking take care of herself. 

The fact that the government allows a room full of strangers to decide they know you better in half an hour than you have known yourself for 26 years. To decide what “good” means for you as it relates to your life. And they don’t need any empirical scientific evidence proving any kind of diagnosis, they aren’t expected to make any diagnosis at all because AFTER ALL HOW COULD THEY?? THE DOCTOR ONLY INTERVIEWS YOU FOR TEN MINUTES! HE CAN’T BE EXPECTED TO DO THAT! They don’t even need to write much of anything down. I was diagnosed with “doesn’t seem right to us,” and that was understood.

This is the process with which free men can become prisoners in America, if you are so generous as to call it a “process.” I don’t know how it happened, that psychiatrists came to have so much unconscionable power over other citizens. Surgeons, physicians and paramedics are required to honor DNR requests in the ER and watch people die but if a young man mentions he has fantasized about suicide, he is a prisoner of the state? Belonging to some resident psychiatrist? 

Which brings me to the field of psychiatry, which is —in my opinion—subjective, philosophical and dubious. The fruit of psychiatrists’ labor is not evident in any measurable way. If a cardiologist makes a bad call, and his patient dies of a heart condition, there’s clear and discoverable where/why/how/IF he went wrong. The last psychiatrist I went to said she had patients who committed suicide but she knows she is not responsible for that, it’s not related to her, so she does not feel guilt. That is unlike any other professional doctor whose patient had unexpectedly died of a condition he or she had been treating. 

But to justify shoving meds down your throat, they claim mental illness is “just like” physical illness. “‘Being depressed’ is just like having high blood pressure or gout.” 

Wow! What a thought! Can’t say I’m convinced. What I am becoming increasingly convinced of, however, with every passing day, is that you’ll say just about anything to get me to take these meds. What disorder involves the use glib speech in pursuit of power over others? You know, one of those that is “JUST LIKE” gout?

They listen to a fellow citizen talk for half an hour, give generic, subjective advice with presumptive authority over how strangers should live their lives (granted to them by a few extra years of school) and prescribe whatever they are told is the Hip New Med^TM to treat whatever they’re calling whatever collection of symptoms now. 

And they really, really love the meds, so many meds. Life-saving meds, they have meds for everything ! If you take them for two weeks and let them experiment on your brain like a lab rat in a maze, they let you out. If you’re noncompliant like I was, they make you stay longer. They don’t “get to know” you, they don’t “treat” you. They pump and dump, wash your sheets for the next one, and they BULLY anyone who is passionate about having their personal freedoms stripped, implying THAT’s childish. The government that somehow became allowed to treat its own citizens like babies. “You’re free to live your life! until we decide we know better, that is” As if this weren’t a country but a twisted adult orphanage. 

“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive.”
- C.S. Lewis

And who the hell HASN’T at least fantasized about suicide? “The thought of suicide is a great consolation: by means of it one gets through many a dark night.” -Nietzsche” sure no one relates to that. How do you lose your rights for admitting something that is considered more or less universal? What’s wrong with these doctors and nurses? Do they have histrionic personality disorder??!?? Do they need sedated ????? I have a shot",06Sep2019,0
101,"I've been doing a lot of reflecting the past few days. I have to write series of personal essays for school applications so perhaps that's why. I noticed a pattern in some of my interpersonal relationships below:

People who stop talking to me are usually people I see on a consistent/daily basis. At least 50 minutes (class period) to 8-24 hours a day. The people who like me or don’t have anything bad to say about me are people who I see 1x-4x a year, barely speak to over phone (only text), or see a handful of times a month.

Regarding this, the most recent person who stopped talking to me was a former roommate/coworker. Anytime I was in the room, she would walk in without saying anything and only force herself to say bye if someone else was around me. She refused to say anything to me or look at me while I spoke at meetings or lunches. I sort of got the impression that she didn't really like me beyond being roommates/coworkers, which is fine, I kind of felt the same. But it was never to the point where we interacted like that, in complete silence/avoidance. Sadly, this isn't the first time this has happened to me: something similar happened with two coworkers I rarely interacted with last year. They were much older than I was, and I think since they had seen so many people in my position, I was probably the weakest link to them in terms of what they were expecting and they eventually just shut me out. In both situations, I never asked what was wrong, I guess at the time because I felt powerless or like I couldn't do anything because they would just feign ignorance or say ""Nothing"". If you would like more information or have more questions about that, please let me know. I should say not everyone that I have spent significant time with has done this to me or treated me this way, but for the ones that have, it has almost always been people I see 2-3x a week, if not more.

These are some of the qualities I exhibit in these situations

* Standoffish/passive. At work, it might seem like I lack initiative or creativity because I fail to ask for help or think I can resolve things on my own.
* Get annoyed with someone or think they don't like me, then a week or two later, I kind of forget about it
* Easily forgive people who mistreat me. Usually happens after 1-2 weeks. I second guess my reaction and have felt bad for asserting myself
* Talk at length about things/people that are bothering me rather than resolving issue with them (moreso during college, high school. I'm 24 now and haven't done this as much without setting up a time to talk with said person)
* Push people away/reject people before they reject me. Things like avoiding saying hi first when I sense they might be pulling away. If we do have a conversation, I might be overthinking it and come as weird as a result.
* Been described as moody, mean, unapproachable. All by closer friends and family. Also have been described as nice (often too nice) and sweet by an equal, if not greater, number of people. Sometimes it feels like people walk on eggshells around me, usually if I have displayed some of the traits outlined above at one point. However, I’m not an angry or confrontational person. I think it’s moreso my vibe/aura. I’ve also been told by one or two people that I look sad, although this was during stressful time of my life. I used to always have an excuse ready for it, but now that I understand and can label some of my behaviors, I know it’s not because of my period or because I’m stressed.

I just noticed these patterns last night after reflecting and wanted to know if this might point to something? I know for a fact, I have some form of social anxiety, possibly depression or dysthymia, and am afraid I might have Borderline. I've been to LCSW's for the former two, but haven't received an official psych diagnosis, especially for borderline. No therapist has suggested it to me but I thought about it when I've been remembering some things from high school/childhood.",06Sep2019,1
102,"Since I’ve been in college, and really even before that, I’ve had problems motivating my self to do schoolwork or anything else. I was a great student when I was very young, but my grades crept down beginning in 8th grade. I’ve struggled a lot in college and feel like I’ve caused serious harm to my future by simply not doing work. 

I get so distracted by any little thing that I don’t get anything done. I skip a lot of classes and often try to push stuff off until the last minute, and often just decide then that it’s not worth doing. I do have productive periods, but they are only a few hours out of the week where I power clean my apartment or knock out a bunch of assignments, while the rest of my time is spent on my phone, watching tv, and taking naps. I also do hobbies like espresso making and hiking when I know I should be doing school work. I’m also extremely impulsive, I binge eat on an almost daily basis and do things like buying coffee without even thinking about it, even if I already had coffee that morning. I also do things to annoy my girlfriend without thinking about it. 

I thought for a while that I was depressed, but I am just not that sad. I saw someone post about ADD recently and that sounds like another possibility. I’ve tried to book an appointment with my school’s mental health office, but they are completely booked until January.

Whatever is wrong with me has gotten much worse over the past few weeks, and I feel like I’m ruining my own life.  Ive missed at least one class every day for the past 2 weeks, and have not turned in multiple assignments.

103,"I'm going to say some things which I've never heard said/read about in regard to the concept of 'personality disorder'. It will involve an analysis of the dominant concepts of psychiatric diagnosis and the ontological construction of the many things distinguished in the DSM as disorders.

But I'm going to say a lot more than that.

In explaining my analysis I'm going to use and make reference to some of the ideas of critical, dialectical, materialist thinkers such as Roland Barthes and others.

The first part will deal with premises and context that are necessary to understand my general analysis:

                    Suffering:

A diagnosis in my experience has always been a confusing thing: not the diagnosis itself, but the decision and conclusion of diagnosis. Is it something the doctor said to you that must be interpreted as a diagnosis? Do I need to look for a document on which a box is officially checked? 

 I experienced this, and later the diagnosis were treated more plainly as certain and specific diagnosis by other doctors, and used to complete disability assistance forms. These were added to other previous diagnosis, which have always seemed reasonable and acurate descriptions to me, such as major depresive disorder, minor depressive disorder and generalized anxiety. In my own research have realized that my constellation of symptoms is almost completely the same as that which the DSM designates as bipolar 2. 
I also read many accounts and reports of misdiagnosis in regard to all these overlapping symptom clusters. This issue of diagnosis/misdiagnosis is to me not simply irrelevant and meaningless (outside an interest in the DSM), but precisely illustrative of a discourse of wrong questions and unquestioned assumptions.
It is a pursuit that follows the wrong way of thinking about suffering. What we know is that I have X symptoms. That is all. 

I had a psychiatic professional tell me, and include in their notes after our first and only 1 hour assesment, that they saw ""elements of borderline personality disorder"" and ""narsisistic personality disorder"". I had been in great distress at the time. I had been suffering greatly and none of this had to do with any interpersonal conflict. 

I have been struggling with a worsening nightmare of what i will DESCRIBE as chronic dysphoria, severe depression, anxiety, endless, galvanized sorrow, feeling things very intensley, a harrowingly intense and complex emotional experience in life generally... I regularly experience excuciating pain that I would willingly trade for the pain of a serious physical injury. At least there are pain killers for the latter. This ongoing experience is a cummulative hardship which has brought me to a perspective that is pathologized as 'suicidality', but is no different than that of a terminally ill patient who requests euthanasia. I asked several different medical/psychiatric proffessionals if they would call such patients ""suicidal"". They all said ""no"". 

The somewhat paradoxical thing here is: in the sense that my situation could be described as ""terminal"", it would be such that unbareable suffering makes life unacceptable and unaffordable, thus this nervous system shuts down. When we die of organ failure we do not refer to our late liver as having been suicidal.

I have half humorously 'diagnosed' the psych proffessional I mentioned, and others, with what I call psychiatric professional disorder (PPD).

         Conceptualisation and abstraction of 
         the ""mental"" in psychiatry and medical 
         science generally:

The ""mind"" is simply the nervous system appearing to itself. It is our sense of our capacity to sense. ""Consciousness"" is not a thing that exists somewhere and has concrete being. It is an effect. I use the metaphor of a video camera being pointed at the monitor it is feeding. This is the vanishing point of the what we call mental, mind, thought, consciousness. It is a horizon that is both the limit of everything and the possibility of everything. And for those of you who are familiar with Roland Barthes (who was not an idealist but a marxist, a materialist who dealt with language in terms of signs and the production of meaning, a semiologist who produced an indispensable critique of bourgeois ideology), it makes sense when he says that language is a horizon.

The language of psychiatry is formed ideologically. It is guided by the dominant ideology and unquestioned, unapparent ideological assumptions of our society. What I'm talking about is political. The dominant ideology and political discourse do not appear as such when they are reproduced and disemminated, and this is their integral characteristic: depoliticisation. In this way the political is usurped by the pathological, the 'natural/unnatural' false oposition/empty concepts, the scientific, the essential, the eternal... referencing Barthes again, myth is the opposite of politics. The dominant ideology appears as myth. 

The word  'psyche' meant, for the ancient greeks, the 'soul'. With the rise of the enlightenment and empiricism it came to refer to the 'mind'.  Psychiatry is a practice with roots in ancient greece, but it was concieved, acording to the dominant notions of the time, as dealing with the problems of the 'soul'. 

Today, in capitalist society, myth is essential because it is the means of ideological dissemination for the ruling class  (those with the monopoly on violence, police, military to protect private property and the latter's corresponding economic system/production relations, which requires poverty and oppression etc.) So it is no surprise that such abstact and mythological concepts of 'personality' -  precisely those of 'ordered' or 'disordered personality' - are made use of. Nor should it come as a surprise that one of  the biggest science magazines is called ""Nature"". If we evolved from bacteria, then what is not, as we name it, 'nature' or 'natural'? These terms, if used in any universal way, are only used ideologically, especially ""human nature"". Everything is natural, but not everything is a good idea. We will argue about what is a good idea, that's political. We invented nature. It's a myth.

          The DSM:

If one has a cut, it may bleed. Bleeding is a symptom, a sign of a cut. If one has cancer, a tumor, this is diagnosed as such, as it is concretely, emperically observed. Cancer will have symptoms and these can be unequivocally confirmed to be symptoms of their cause, the cancer. 

The DSM is a book of symptoms. The accounting for the exact causes of these symptoms ranges from inconclusive to speculative. To be fair, there is much evidence of commonalities in the experiences, histories of many who appear to share the same symptoms (many have experienced trauma for example). There is also some certainty of the role of neurochemicals in the appearance and absence of these symptoms. 

In my opinion, all this suffering is symptomatic of the material social alienation of capitalist society. I don't claim to be positing an exact science here. But certainly anyone who concieves what our culture calls 'personality' to be an empirically observable object of scientific study probably doesn't have a convincing and undefeatable counterargument.

Symptoms are observable things that are differentiated and categorized, arranged into clusters based on groups of studied people who share the greatest number of shared symtoms. If it looks like many people have more or less the same set of particular symptoms, the proffessionals put a bow on it and call it a disorder. Now it's a like an invisible, supposed, if not imaginary, tumor. This enables a massive pharmaceutical industry to produce specific drugs for specific disorders and make billions of dollars. There is evidence that some psychiatric drugs can in the long term (and many are designed to work through long term use) make conditions worse.

           Care:

Proffessionals treat pathology. Human beings give care for suffering.

One of the central themes in the (usually, at least conceptually/theoretically, abusive and dehumanizing) treatment of people diagnosed with BPD is ""emotional dysregulation"". 

If i could simply 'regulate' my emotions, then how would they be emotions? According to the way the word 'emotion' is conceptualized and translated all over the world, 'emotional regulation' is an absurdity, almost an oxymoron. What is particularly insidious about this concept is that it is employed by a proffessional class with power and authority over others, power to manipulate, coherce and create barriers. These people are emotionally motivated like the rest of us, but their praxis is sanctified and their methods legitimized. They are the authority in deciding whose actions are normal (theirs) and whose are merely the problematic behaviour of someone who cannot 'regulate their emotions'.

But the biggest consequence of this theoretical approach is that we have one person (a proffessional) whose experience is X (let's say, not a living nightmare of pain and despair) pathologizing another person whose experience is Y (a living nightmare of pain and despair). The point is that psychiatry has labled people who are actually experiencing extremely intense emotions (not experienced by the professional) as having a disorder; as if we all feel the same emotions, but some of us have to be taught to regulate them.

This is a treacherous con.

Psychiatry, having run out of ideas (or drugs) for treatment resistant symptoms have decided to say ""well, if this is just a problem with your personality, then we can't help you except to send you to therapy that is basically  a kind of reward/punish type obedience school where you will be taught that you are a problem because your behaviour is a problem, and you have to be taught how to behave.""

The classification of personality disorder pathologizes a concept (personality) which is otherwise almost universally understood to be a general collection or series of appearances and distinctions that is growing and changing (how ever slightly or slowly), a concept that refers to the constitution of the mystery of another human being, of the growing changing self, the mystery of selfhood, to the whole, the sum we call ""person"", unable to sense beyond a vanishing point which makes all known things perceivable and gives everything it's perceived limit.

Capitalist society produces, by way of the family, production relations, by all its various alienating social relations, a sea of trauma and suffering. It is maintained by a monopoly on violence, but that same monopoly is the monopoly that decides how to deal with the inconvenient damage it has caused: it is also the monopoly on the 'care' and 'service provision'  that is needed in order to attend to the suffering it produces. In accordance with the hypocritical ideology of capital, liberalism, it pays it's moral debt. It treats pathology. 

This 'care' depoliticizes. It does not recognize social material conditions and the contradictory social relations therein. It deals with the 'disordered personalities', those who fail to adequately reproduce the capitalist social relations of production and property as members of families, workforces, universities, bussinesses, armies, consumer groups etc. They still play a role, of course: capitalist society is impossible without a rough amount of desperation, unmet need, unemployment, and criminalisation.

104,"I’m 19 (f) and I’ve never had a job before. I was lucky enough that my dad didn’t force me to have a job while in high school and he supported my choice not to get a job while I acclimated to college. My dad is not rich by any means but he does pay for my phone and other necessities and would continue to do so if I needed, but it’s been weighing on me that he spends so much money on me when he only gets around $2000 a month (he is on disability for an autoimmune disease). I know I don’t need a job, but I really want to have one just so I don’t have to burden him as much. 

I applied and I got a call back. I’m supposed to call and set up an interview this morning but I can’t get myself to do it. Not only am I terrified of making phone calls but I can’t stop think about everything that might prevent me from going through with it. 

I have an intense fear of failure. I am a perfectionist and so when I think there’s a chance that I might fail (or do less than perfect) I just... don’t do it. I have been really working on that part of myself and I think even if I don’t get the job I can live with myself but the related issue that is preventing me from doing this is having to ask my dad for a ride to the interview since I don’t drive. This means he would know what I’m doing. I know he would support me, but I really can’t control my thoughts. The idea of someone else knowing I failed is even worse to me.

133,"33F, first diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 17, at my first rehab. I was being prescribed a mood stabilizer that made me feel like the walking dead, and I questioned the diagnosis, so I soon stopped taking it. I continued to drink and use drugs on and off until 19. I sobered up for a while but started drinking heavily again. I wasn’t in a doctors care again until I was 26, diagnosed bipolar and PTSD this time. I was also back to using drugs at that point and still not taking meds. Since then, I’ve been hospitalized 4 times (1 involuntary and 3 voluntary), back to rehab and was seen by multiple psychiatrist/psychologist/LPNs/therapist. It’s been a struggle to find a medication combination that I’ll actually stick with and to stop using alcohol and drugs. I find the meds make me sleepy/groggy, gives me tremors/involuntary muscle movements, feeling numb/emotionless, trouble concentrating, memory problems, weight gain, and the list goes on.. I’ve had periods of sobriety, on medication, in therapy and things were good. But the meds will stop working after so long, so it’s back to square one. I’m currently on meds, at moderate doses and in therapy but I’m tending to still want to self medicate with drugs! I also do not take my meds as prescribed.

I read posts every day on social media by people saying “I feel lost”, “I don’t know what to do with my life”, “I used to be successful, but I don’t know what happened”, “I think I’m depressed but I don’t know who to talk to about it”.

Every time I read one of those posts, my heart feels a squeeze because I was once where these people are now and I wish I could give each one a hug and tell them it’s going to be alright. And it IS going to be alright.  

How do I know it’s going to be alright when I don’t even know these people?

When I was a Language Teachers’ Coach, I mentored many of my trainees, people who later became very close friends of mine.  What do I mean by “mentored”?  Well, for some it was getting their teaching career off the ground.  For others it was listening to them talk about the overwhelming challenges they were going through and giving them feedback.  

And who was mentoring the mentor?  Nobody because the mentor didn’t like showing weakness and I thought admitting I needed help was weak.  Yes, I had to learn the hard way.  

Many years ago, in typical female fashion, I decided I wanted to lose weight so I went to a doctor recommended to me by a cousin.  I went on a diet he prescribed and a month later, seeing that I hadn’t lost “enough” weight, he ran tests and informed me my thyroid wasn’t working properly and proceeded to put me on thyroid medicine.  I took that drug for over a year.  

One fine day, I’m teaching my class and I suddenly feel a rush of adrenaline, a cold sweat, and a clear feeling that I was losing my mind and that I had to get out of that classroom as fast as possible.  The feeling passed in a couple of minutes and life went on.

That night, I woke up with that feeling of anguish, fear, insanity and the impulse to run out of the house.  

And it happened the next day, several times.

And every single night after that.

I went to see a cardiologist and several general practitioners who found nothing. 

And little by little, I slowly started to fall into a deep depression.  Lack of sleep and thinking you’re losing your mind will do that to you. 

Weeks passed and one day, as I was teaching a class, my soul couldn’t take anymore fear, anxiety and stress and I stood in front of my class and said: “You guys, I’m so sorry, I’m not feeling well, I don’t know what’s happening with me but I haven’t slept in weeks because I’m afraid to close my eyes.”  Words just stumbled out of my mouth and I told everyone what I had been going through.

One of my students must have seen something in my eyes because she passed me a piece of paper and said: “Here, go see this psychiatrist.  He got me out of a depression a couple of years ago, when I tried to commit suicide.  Tell him you’re my friend and it’s an emergency.”  I don’t know what shocked me more, the matter of fact way she had just informed all of us about this very personal, painful thing that she’d been through, or that I grabbed that slip of paper like it was a lifeline or the fact that that glimmer of hope was coming from a young girl at least 20 years younger than I was.  

The psychiatrist saw me that same afternoon.  I sat down among oriental carpets and figures of the Buddha and told him my sad sad story of craziness.  He didn’t even blink.  He just said, “You’re having panic attacks, they’re very common.  Especially because you’ve been taking thyroid medicine that you probably never needed.  I can get rid of those panic attacks in two days.  But what we have to nip in the bud is that depression you’re falling into.” At that moment I felt like a rock had been lifted from my soul.  

He had me get blood tests to check glucose and thyroid levels and I was back with my test results a week later.  He looked at them and said, “Stop taking the thyroid meds.”  I asked when I should return for my next visit.  He replied, “You don’t need therapy, but I need an English teacher.  So let’s use your time slot for classes.”  And that’s how my psychiatrist turned into my life coach/mentor/student.  

Our sessions were a mixture of me teaching him English, him teaching me how to meditate, discussing the psychology of the latest movies, and him asking about my job, family, giving me great feedback and just being my life coach.  That’s when I realized that everyone needs a life coach, a mentor, someone to bounce ideas off of and to talk you off the ledge when you’re about strangle a boyfriend.  I survived and I thrived, but I had help. 

If YOU feel lost, anxious, depressed, empty, confused and don’t even know where to begin to deal with your feelings, much less overcome them, find a mentor, someone who is more experienced than you, someone whose judgment you trust.  It can be a friend, an acquaintance you look up to, a family member or even a former professor.

Some of us find it hard to open up to others about our innermost feelings or pain, so make an effort to get past that discomfort.  You will be surprised at what you’ll learn about yourself when someone looks at your pain from a different point of view, one that is clearer.

I think back to those times when I was able to mentor and guide some of my trainees and I feel so privileged to have had that opportunity to be a teeny tiny little light in someone’s dark path.

I've never done anything I'm remorseful of, and I've done some pretty bad things. I've never thought about it because I'm just me but when someone in my family or someone close to me passes away I don't care. That's not supposed to be rude and it's not a decision I make like ''hey fuck this person'', but no part of me feels anything when somebody perishes. That's the same with a lot of stuff, I don't feel anything for my actions.  I put this to the side a lot as a kid when I put myself down, ""you're just a naive kid, you have emotion'' is what I'd tell myself, but I don't.

There's two emotions I'll ever truly have. That's a brief happiness, but never overly-happy emotion I'll get on birthdays and other occasions where you're supposed to be but only enough to get a slight smile, the rest is all faked to please the people around me, so they're pleased. The other emotion I feel is anger, I feel anger, a lot.  I found myself taking my anger out on smaller animals from the ages of 10-13.

I hate admitting to it that's why I'm making a throwaway but my life is kind of a lie. I see everyone and everything as a game of sorts and sometimes I wonder if I'm really out of touch with reality as a whole. People think they know me but they don't, they know what I make them believe, most people are actually very stupid and easy to manipulate. I use peoples emotions and feelings to benefit myself in ways, usually smaller ways, but I'm still fairly young. I can drop my ''friends'' like flies if they cause any inconvenience to me or my life, like recently I just stopped talking to my friend of 12 years because I wasn't benefiting in anyway, morally (from another persons view) that's disgusting and I'm sure people would think down of me if they heard that but I don't care, truly, I care for nothing.  I think I love my parents, but I don't know if that's just a false belief from all the years I've had to believe it. Because my mom had a near-death experience and I was told she had died, and didn't care.

While reading this you're probably thinking the worst of who I am, which you should, because this is the worst of me. This isn't a choice I think I was naturally wired differently but would like a solid word I can go off. None of this bothers me in anyway, which is what's weird. I hope I covered everything, ask me anything if it helps you help me.",06Sep2019,1
142,"Ive been in and out of therapy over the years, I Maybe been to 5 over the past 8 or so years, Im 18 and a half male. I Started having panic attacks and crazy hypochondria when I was young and things just spirriled down hill. my dad always put me down when i was younger even still now but we still talk i guess. I Dealt with psychosis and horrible intrusive thoughts,been lonely and generally hate myself. I still have hobbys,like working out cooking sports,video games music,movies,travelling,taking walks stuff like that. But my mind is so broken. the doctor took me of the medication cuz i told him it wasnt doing anything. I been into drugs and alcohol because they help me escape although I dont use them that often. I fantasize about being high alot,yes it doesnt solve my problems but it puts them on hold. I feel suicidal some times. Ive been hospitalized 3 times for psychosis and drinking related problems ( although there separate issues) I get nightmares and bizzare dreams. im not in school rn, I Finished high school back in june and didnt go to college cuz i was dealing with a lot of problems in grade 12 mentally.  like ive said ive been in therapy again for 5 months and to be quite honest i find it useless. People just tell me to keep busy which i do regardless. I tried to even expand my horrisions with online dating and trying to meet new girls even friends and nobody really seems interested which hurt my self confidence.",06Sep2019,1
143,"Hello Everyone. I don‘t know what do to anymore and need some advice. I am going to keep it short.

I met a guy on tinder, we met and had 3 amazing dates. We immediately had this connection. But whenever we got very close he seemed to be overwhelmed by it and he didn‘t reply to my messages for several days (he did this a few times). He said he is interested in me and wants to see where all this could lead to...but at the moment he‘s not responding again.. 
I really like this guy, and don‘t want to lose him..so:

147,"Because my dad found a job opurtunity in another country, I moved for a year and then came back to the same school. After a few days, I find that my friend has been really depressed, has committed self-harm and almost left the school while I was gone.

I had no idea that she felt this way and I straight up don't know what to do. I've also had similar problems and been close to self-harm, but I hobby know how he situation is. She says that she is fine now, but I really want to be there for her. I just don't know what to do.

I have had a similar experience with another friend, but at that time, I could still see them and I kept frequent contact with him. This is different as she went way further and still has all these emotions while I also feel bad that I left her.

150,"Hi everyone, I hope this is the right place to post. I apologize in advance if this is insensitive, I am just trying to get some outside perspective. My mother just married someone who has schizophrenia, and has been managing it for over decades with meds and regularly sees a psychiatrist. I'm not super close with either of them, but they are coming to visit next week. I have met the person several times and he seems very nice, and they're coming to visit next week. My question is, should I be worried about him having possible hallucinations or breaks from reality? I have a small child in the house, and I know this man loves kids and has never hurt anyone, but I'm wondering if it's a bad idea to let them babysit while my husband and I go out for a movie or something? 
I know I could Google this and find out more, but I am just hoping to have a conversation with people who have experience in this matter. How do I know he's taking his meds? Would it be totally off base for me to ask? Like I said, I'm not super close with either of them. 

FYI I do know schizophrenia doesn't automatically make someone dangerous or violent, and I don't want to stereotype people with mental illness. I'm a new mom and perhaps I worry too much. Just looking for some input.",06Sep2019,1

154,"Throughout my life, I would get a dream that would feel as though it would last for a day or two every few months (give or take). As of a few months ago, I've been having a dream that'll feel as thought it had lasted for a few days to a week. This has been happening every week to every couple weeks. Everytime it feels so real. I will talk to people that I don't know in the real world but I feel as though I've known them my entire life in my dreams. They're almost always different people each time. There's always a girl (a different girl each time) that I'll get to know very well. I'll meet her at the beginning of my dream and take her out on elaborate dates and vacations. We'll even live together sometimes. It is the most genuine form of love that I've ever felt towards a partner. I have come here because it's starting to take a big toll on my mental health. I haven't cried when waking up from one of those dreams in a while but it's devastating every time. I haven't been able to comprehend trying to find a relationship with anyone because I'm terrified that if I do, one day I'll wake up and it'll all be gone again. What could be causing these dreams? I haven't been in a relationship in almost a year so I don't think that could be the cause. Any input will be greatly appreciate as I have no clue on how to deal with this and there's no way in hell I can afford a professional to talk to so here I am! Ha ha..",06Sep2019,2

156,"17 years old, had a pretty shitty upbringing so far. Several failed suicide attempts. Had a golden age of my life from 14-17 with a girl who I thought I’d marry shortly out of high school. Didn’t. I’ve moved past self harm and suicide. But the state my mind is in is horrible. I don’t sleep, as my dreams are extremely destructive towards my mental health. I don’t have friends, I moved away from them long ago and never made any because I dropped out. I lost my girl. I’ve had no father since five and have always been butting heads with my mom because she is content with the fucked up life we live simply because “she has god”. And she has no intentions on helping me at all, with anything. I have been having increasing worse problems with my asthma, constant back pain, two broken teeth I was never allowed to go to the dentist for, bad joint pain, etc etc. I know that she won’t take me to a therapist or whatever. I went to one once when my dad died and the professional didn’t really care at al and after the session just wanted to dope me up on drugs, which my mother didn’t want to pay for (no insurance, to this day). I lost my job because she ended up refusing to drive me there, despite not allowing me to even get my driving permit. And I love miles out into the woods, so it’s not like I can just go do something for fun or anything. 

For as long as I have been alive I have never seen my mom work. She relies solely on the survivor check she gets every month because of my fathers death. When I turn 18 it will start going to me instead. This is why I think she is doing this. She doesn’t want to lose it, so the solution is to either make me unable to leave for as long as possible, or drive me to suicide, or kill me. She has no love for me. It’s very apparent. 

And I know what people think the solution is, call CPS. But the risk is far too great. At 17 I don’t think much would happen. In my state, it takes a LOT for cps to do anything. And if I called them and they didn’t help out my situation, the pain she would put me through might finish my mind off completely. All the hopes and aspirations I had dissolved when I lost my relationship because it was my only out. My mother ruined my relationship too, my ex couldn’t handle not seeing me because my mom basically keeps me under a rock.

I just don’t know what to do. I don’t know what the next step is. If I don’t do something I’m either gonna be stuck here forever or I’ll end up taking the easy way out. I need therapy bad., but I don’t even know how to approach getting it.",06Sep2019,1

I'm having terrible ideas. I always suffered of weird, horrifying ideas in my mind. This time it involves my mom. I love her to death and I will do everything to make her proud of me but I just can't get rid of these ideas. 
One day, I said that if I didn't stop masturbating for 7 days then mom will get cancer. I always do this but I always wish the  bad things for myself. I thought that involving the person that I love the most in this world will stop me, but I did it and I hate myself for that. What kind of person I am. I HATE ME SO MUCH.
What if it really happens, even if it didn't happen I'm a horrible person. Please help me, I love her and I hate myself so much. How could i wish such a thing for her while she only gave me love.

I know it takes a while to find what types of medication and what dosages work for you but within that time I’ve heard people saying that it’ll make them worse and then they’ll eventually get better. I don’t think I could survive for that long. I’m gonna start going to see a psychologist soon that’s for sure but I’m gonna give it a couple of years before I start using medication.

After my first week all of my fears have now been confirmed. I truly do have no friends.  In the past school year I pushed aside my social anxieties and rlly tried to find my true self.

I'm now early 30s and been on SSRIs for 9 months and my anxiety is great and depression eased to a decent level.

168,"Sounds crazy, stupid and cringey. I know. But hear me out. 

Around 3-4 years ago, I was really depressed, my mum had attempted suicide around a year before that because of my dad cheating and she was just generally abusive whilst my dad was emotionally abusive. I ended up watching a show out of boredom and there was a single character, who had, i dont know how, but he helped me so much during that rough time. 

Ever since, for the past 3/4 years, I’ve been crazy obsessed with him, he is all I have on my mind, all day, every day. I’ve started believing that he’s real, and I’m sure we’re soulmates. I’ve had dreams about him were we got married. My theory is that we were just born In different worlds by mistake and I reality we are meant to be and one day that mistake will be reversed and we will live together. 

Sometimes, I think to myself, I’m delusional, he’s not real, I’ll never see him in my life. And I’ll never get to be with him. And I get really upset. 

He’s taken over my life so much at this point; all my thoughts circle back to him. Even when I’m busy with something he’s always in the back fo my mind. Always. I’m sick of it. Part of me hates him for doing this to me.  

I’m not sure if this has anything to do with it but I thought I’ll say it just in case, but I’ve been diagnosed with ocd and I’ve tried to commit suicide.

171,"So ever since I was a kid I've always surrounded by low self esteem. Mostly having to do with financial problems and other family issues between my parents. My father i've noticed is always very passive-aggressive. Always fussing about why his kitchen isnt clean, tossing stuff in the sink, either putting stuff away real loud along with feeling the need to lecture me when i try to talk to him about my problems like im some fucking 6 year old. And because of that I no longer tell him anything personal about what im feeling. Now my mother is incredibly more negative then my father. Venting about how much she hates her job, how her fellow employees ""treat"" her, how she hasnt gotten a raise in almost 10-15 years, how much she hates being fat and how she has all this doubt about her being able to put the weight off. This started little by little since i was say maybe 10 or 11 years old. And hearing and seeing all this negativity has given me a very poor outlook on life and what my future will look like. I think about really horrible things that i think i have done or might do and what will happen to me in my future because of what i think i have done, how people will really see me or will see me if i open up to them about my thoughts or my feelings. It's my belief that they essentially ruined my life before it ever had a chance to begin and the funniest part is... They didnt even have to try. They just had to be.
