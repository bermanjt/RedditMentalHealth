1,"I’m going to group therapy for the first time tomorrow. It’s for human service professionals in drug or alcohol recovery. I was a drug user but I’ve stopped for a few years now. 

I talk myself out of individual therapy because of price and because I’m not “that bad”. I’m happy, hold a fulfilling job, meeting my goals, and have love in my life. I don’t know if I have a mental illness. I’ve never been diagnosed. 

But I’ve had drug cravings lately. I haven’t acted on these cravings. 

I feel like I’ve done this backwards. I quit using without medical assistance. Now I finally want therapy. I don’t know if this group setting is appropriate with what I’ve experienced. What is “recovery”, exactly? Something medical, with professional guidance? 
Thanks in advance.",07Dec2019,1

3,"Last night I was laying in bed, telling dumb jokes with my boyfriend.  I thought of something that'd happened a week ago - not that funny admittedly, but it started a laughing fit.  At first I thought it was just a regular case of giggles, but then it went on....and on....and on.  Ten minutes later I was still laughing and at that point beginning to sob.  I couldn't stop myself, it was frightening, not having any kind of control over it, yet being fully aware of it.  I've been really stressed lately, with health problems mounting on each other and school/finances.  I've never experienced anything like it before though.  I've done research on PBA but I've not experienced it and haven't any brain damage...that I know of?  Could it just have been the stress buildup?",07Dec2019,1

I can recognize the thoughts and used to be able to reason them away with an internal monologue, but they are nonstop lately.  I'm scared that I won't be able to function much longer.  Right now all I can manage is to get up, go to work, and go to bed, just the bare minimum motions.  I eat lunch at home, shower every day, and pretend to be a functioning adult at work, but I'm not.

5,"mmmm i am

&amp;#x200B;

having an *identity crisis* and I could really use some advice + comfort.

&amp;#x200B;

*This* is what this looming, distant feeling dread has been all along. This is what I've always been afraid of, what this emptiness has always been, why I don't trust myself. I'm afraid to be happy, and the prospect of being comfortable with myself and possibly being happy is scary to me.

I guess I've rationalized that any Trauma I've experienced was my fault, because I let myself get attached to all these ""good"" and ""frivolous"" things like ""*stability""*  and *""confidence""*  and *""a sense of worth*"" LMAO 

It feels like happiness is this red-hot piece of metal, and if I touch it, I'm just going to get hurt again, like my entire world is going to get rocked, and I'll just suffer for wanting it. And *having* it. You know why people who have nothing to lose never get hurt? That's right. They suffered and went right back to their ""typical"" existence. 

And it just seems *suspiciously* easy. I've finally stripped away all these bad beliefs about myself, very nearly, and I realized that was all there was to me? My ""friendliness""? It's feeding into my need to be liked by *everyone*. The effort I put into everything? I need everything I make to be perfect. I needed to feel perfect. Man, everything that I am just feels like some effort to assuage all these terrible thoughts about myself, and to scavenge for every scrap of control I can get.

Do you know how much that *hurts?* I don't want that all to be who I am. I don't want to just be constantly fighting to be... literally *okay?* I want to be upset over that hypothetical F on a test because I am disappointed, not because I am a failure and I feel like I can't do anything right. I want to help someone because I want to share my happiness with them, not because I need to feel like someone needs me for something.

I *know* that a part of me really cares about others, and I do genuinely want to do good things, and I'm learning/learned to just accept my best for what it is, and to be more secure in general, but I'm tired of my actions being overshadowed by this intense fear of just my complete lack of identity. 

I don't want to feel like a ""nothing"" anymore. I want to find some sort of satisfaction being myself, and I'm not sure where to start. I guess I can start at just convincing myself that it's okay to have these things, and deal with the rest later? I dunno. I'm scared. I'm *really, really* scared. I don't know how to replace all these things I feel like I've lost. I'm really desperate to have an identity, again.

What if I'm not good enough to be the person I want to be? I don't want to fail, but I don't mind taking the risk. I just... I dunno. I don't want to keep getting hurt. I don't want to be a bad person. I don't want my life to feel so meaningless anymore. I don't even know what it means to be... a person? What makes an identity? Thank you for taking the time to read.

 Can you please help? If not, don't feel bad. Writing all my thoughts out have made me feel a little better, anyway. I'm so ready to feel..... *""real""*??? I think everything will be okay, maybe? I'm entertaining the thought LMAO

I think this will pass, but it's still scary as shit, y'all shhsiosgi",07Dec2019,1
6,"I have bipolar II and recently I’ve been having a lot of highs and lows. Regardless of which side of the spectrum I’m on, I’m kind of passively death curious. It’s an odd definition, but it boils down to I’m not suicidal because I wouldn’t commit to something like that unless I’m 100% certain it would work and I’d feel bad for the people who care about me, but I’m also not necessarily happy with life. I saw my psychiatrist today and told him about this and how I almost committed myself to a psych ward a couple weeks ago because of how unstable I felt, but he didn’t seem overly concerned about it.

7,"Since I was a kid I have always dreamed of one day moving out of state. I've never liked living in Los Angeles and who would've thought that one one day I'd meet a girl who I've been with for almost 4 years that feels the same way.
Now I'm 28 and As of lately my mom's health has declined. She is now on dialysis due to kidney issues and is on a wait list to get a transplant. She is 62 years old.
These last few months me and my girlfriend have been getting serious about moving in together hopefully this coming year. But we were also offered a place to stay with her family out of state.
To which I said yes.
My girlfriend on the other hand feels we should stay to take care of my mom. Seeing as how I'm the youngest and have always been the one to take care of/look after her. Not to mention we were always really close.
Honestly I completely agree with my girlfriend it would be the morally correct thing to do.
However I can't help but feel conflicted.
As though I'm giving up on my dreams until she passes away. Which for all I know won't be until another 30 years. To be clear I'm not saying I want her to pass at all. But right now aside from having to do dialysis on herself daily she is able to manage herself. She drives to the market and buys groceries. She's able to cook. Walks around without too much trouble. She is still capable.
But she still has some common health issues for folks her age (high blood pressure, arthritis, diabetes, etc etc.)

So right now I'm completely torn on what to do.

On one hand I want to move out of state where I will feel more happier and able to live the life I want to live but will have to endure the pain when her time does come.

On the other hand I can stay here where I know my depression will be triggered knowing that I'm stuck in LA and I fear it will turn to resentment at some point.

So I need some advice.
Do I follow my dreams?
Or do the morally correct thing and stay in LA where I can check on my mom more.

Side note:
My mom will never agree to live with me and my girlfriend. She wants us to start our own lives together where she won't burden us. That and i wouldn't want her to live with us out of state since she has all her friends and family here and primarily speaks Spanish.
Also if I decided to move out of state I know she'll 100% encourage me to do so because she understands how long I've been dreaming of that.",07Dec2019,1
8,"I cannot shake this easily triggered, irrational internal rage that makes me want to lash out and scream at everyone in the small radius around me, and I need some tips and tricks on how to calm myself down. Keep in mind I am a pacifist and always have been, but ever since 6 months ago this shit keeps happening to me, where I cant even interact with people around me anymore. Ive become a suoer introvert. I started smoking cannibas, and have smoked probably every day for 4 months or longer, and it helps SIGNIFICANTLY, but my employer is drug free so during my 12 hour shift I cant medicate (obviously) and I tend to have gigantic anxiety attacks right at the end of my 12 hour shifts because I want to be home and away from society. I used to be a social butterfly/ attention whore who partied all the time with friends, and could make friends anywhere I went. But now I feel hatred towards anyone in my path. My only soft spot is my S/O who provides all the emotional support in the world that I could ever need.

Has anyone had this happen to them?

If so what changed in your life that made you that way?

Keep in mind ive considered therapy but because In in healthcare myself, Ive lost a shit ton of respect for the field, and simply put with this ""new condition"" I have a hard time taking criticism from others that I know personally.

I often get overwhelmed with nostalgia, and it sometimes makes me want to cry.

10,"Aside from my Wife and Mother, no one else knows this. It just seems dumb and embarrassing considering everyone does it at some point.

I am horribly afraid of death.

I'm 30m. I've been afraid since I was around 8 or 9 years old, I think. My Great-Grandpa was a character; business owner, car enthusiast, functioning alcoholic...And yet we were close. I loved that guy. Unfortunately it's been so long now I don't even remember his face or what we did when I was a kid, I just know that I really loved the guy.

He died of cancer when I was 9. I was devastated. I wanted to go to the funeral, which my Dad and his side of the family wanted me there.

My Mom, divorced from my Dad for 7 years at this point, but supposedly still BFF's, said absolutely not. Despite my pleading and Dad's insistence, it was a no go. What would have been my first funeral, for someone I loved dearly, was taken away by my Mother because she thought it would damage my young brain. (Something I may have never noticed before is that this may have been the very day my Mom started her transformation into a Were-¢uπ+.)

At that point, my brain started to wander on the subject of death. Despite her having religious parents, my Mom never took me to church or prayed. Never explained why or how.

It was also around this time, before GGP's death that I was diagnosed with Depression. So several years of that and death is my #1 fear. I should note that, although I was depressed, I never once considered suicide. Mom, however, was under the impression that I was suicidal and wanted me to get help.

""I'm not suicidal, Mom. I am afraid to die. I'm afraid of death in general!""

this was apparently the wrong thing to do, as my mother then decided that I need extra special help and should probably be committed.


The funny thing is my mom never capitalized on that, and I never ended up getting any help for that. I had some counseling and psychogical evaluations when I was 8 or 9, but that was about it.

The panic attacks from my fear of death probably didn't start happening until I was about 15. They were minor, but they happened pretty frequently. As time went on they happened less and less, but whenever they did happen it was more defined and painful and scary.

Just 2 days ago I had my worst one yet. Still haven't quite recovered from it. I try only to sleep a few hours a night how to appear that I won't wake up, or that I'll have nightmares about it that I've had since I was young.

And it's not just my death I'm afraid of. Whenever a pet goes, or even just seen something on the news, I freak out. Concepts of afterlife don't qwell the fear at all. I simply never want to die and hate that I have to.

I try to put on a brave face for my kids, because I don't want them growing up with that fear. Despite my on and off feelings about Christianity and God and Heaven, I let my boys know that they need to have faith and belief. But it personally brings me no solace.

I hate this fear. I don't want to die. I've actually decided that if there was a possible chance that immortality was a real thing, I'd pursue it despite the consequences. Anything! My own wife doesn't even know about that part. She wholeheartedly believes that God is the way it works everything and that will live eternally as long as we give ourselves to the Lord.

It's not that I don't believe, that I can't trust anything I can't see or feel and to my head I always come to the conclusion that one day I'm just simply going to go to sleep and not wake up and that scares the s*** out of me. No more light to no more thoughts and no more movement. Just nothing. Not even Darkness.

I'm not even in my midlife yet and I've had so many crisises about this.

13,"I have actually posted this before but no one responded and I don’t mean to clog the subreddit by reposting. I am a high school senior. My family and therapist think I have mild depression and anxiety, mostly brought on by academic stress.

The truth is that I’m hiding experiences that I know would sound like severe mental illness to most people. I can’t go into detail because I think it would be dangerous, but I’m my mind is being controlled and possibly poisoned and that as a form of psychological torture they are making me think I have different physical diseases and that I’m sort of receiving messages from this consciousness that’s a larger part of the universe. It’s very hard to explain. But it’s terrifying. 

Again, I can’t go into more depth. But that’s only scratching the surface. I know enough psychology to know exactly how this sounds. 

Everyone in my life would be shocked and horrified if they knew the extent of this. (And I’d feel so guilty for dropping this on all of them). I have mediocre grades and very few friends, but I’m reasonably functional. I’ve hidden it for months and no one in my life even realizes anything out of the ordinary is happening.

My external facade is so dramatically different from what I’m going through inside that I’ve also begun to feel extremely dissociated. It’s like I’m living two lives. Though I probably seem aloof, spaced out, and depressed, I appear “normal” and functional enough that no one notices, especially since I’ve always been very introverted. Even my therapist has no idea. I literally don’t feel like I can physically talk about it.

But I can’t live like this anymore. It’s been months. I’m constantly anxious, and not only is it difficult to live with this, it’s isolating beyond belief to not be able to have anyone understand or know what I’m experiencing in the slightest.

I don’t know what’s going on and I have no idea what to do and I feel very alone and extremely depressed. Please someone help. I don’t have anyone I can talk to about this.",07Dec2019,1

Today I was getting annoyed why I just couldn't balance as well on my skateboard today, I hucked my skateboard, jumped on it and broke a litter box nearby, cracking a corner off. Normally I do have the tendency to break things, but not as much as this. I would usually just hit a desk or curse, but now im actually breaking shit.

Everything just doesn't feel real and I think I might be going a bit insane, not to the point where it's mentally incapable of doing things. I've been feeling a lot more lonely lately, and I am. I have friends but a lot are leaving and I get paranoid as shit about losing them or having them not like me anymore. I get really scared about people that I care about thinking wrongly about me.

18,"I'm targeted by everyone in my life, even random people I encounter. Even the people in my building I try to keep away from. They all target me in various ways, be it verbally mocking me, going through my garbage, dismissing me, talking smack even if I can't see em, and overall just making my life a living hell. My mother, case manager, psychiatrist, nurse practitioner, randoms, ex friends, supposed to be friends, people in my building... their sole motive I learned is to make me kill myself and I am fighting a losing battle. I try to live to spite them but I don't feel I can anymore and they will just win in the end. 

I live in utter squalor and disease, I can't bring myself to clean the cockroach riddled dwelling in which I am a prisoner to, and it is located in a medium support supportive housing.. they said I'm on the list for high support (group home) but that's bullshit. The guy in charge of my house wants me to rot and die in my phobia (bugs) because he wont let me move to the independent units.

They hide my keys sometimes, and other times they're stealing my mail likely having a key to my individual mailbox when they shouldn't.

Everyone's motive (there's more than the last 2 paragraphs but I can't) is to get me to kill myself and I'm almost ready to give them what they want. 

Everyone in my support team just focuses on the slight improvement of functioning, ignoring my quality of life, and that is that I am doing well in an at my own pace school I should have finished almost a decade ago.  They ignore all my concerns, despite being nice.

From just hating how I look, I now hate my personality, my mannerisms, my mindset, literally my everything.


I don't tell anyone what I'm feeling because no one would get it (family). No money for therapy, and even if I did I can't bring myself to tell a stranger my vulnerabilities because I've spent so much time building this wall around me to block everyone from reaching my emotions.

I can't remember when i started, but every time i feel lonely i start to talk to myself, i imagine another person asking me a question and  i answer, then i imagine what they would tell me next. i have full conversations like that and i can be in my room muttering to myself for hours.

Sometimes, when i go to sleep and i concentrate well enough, i can hear a voice saying what i'm thinking about, like, literally hear it, but it's always a scream and it hurts like someone really screamed in your ear, so i don't do it often.

My idea is that i have a really strong imagination, all day i'm thinking about fantasy and worlds i created, so speaking to myself and hearing voices (WHEN I WANT TO, so, it's not like when people hear voices they don't want to hear) is just like the next step of... express that creativity.

i didn't really think about this, is like something that has been always with me, but this week i discovered that in fact people don't usually do this, and don't usually have whole worlds in their heads. I learned thar after my sister enteder my room while talking to myself, she wasn't happy with her discovery, she told my mom and she told me we will talk later (at the end i suppose she forgot, like she always does, so no conversation yet).

When I do have to go out I put in little to zero effort into the way I look and most of the time, dress as if I'm trying to flee the country and run the FBI or some shit. 

I have zero motivation to improve myself, at this point I don't really have any friends, and I worry that this will affect my relationship with my SO someday as well, most especially because most days I don't even want to go out anywhere with them either... 

My mom has gone to the docs for her mental illnesses in the past but she claims it's a waste of money and that they just prescribe her zooloft or xanax that actually induces her symptoms. I have a lot of memories as a child with my mother since I grew up with it just being her and I most of the time (my dad wasn't really in the picture), of her being asleep ALL DAY while I'm awake alone attending to myself. When I look back at those times, I now realize the real effects of those drugs. They really do turn you into a real life zombie. My mom is still prescribed to these medications but she never takes them anymore, they just pile up in medicine cabinet. 

I could also very much tell that she still immensely suffers from her mental illnesses as I still live with and observe how she reacts to certain things and how she goes about her everyday life. Seeing her the way she is really takes a toll on how I feel as well. I don't want to end up like my mother and I don't want to take medicine that only sweeps my emotions under a rug temporarily but at this point I am willing to do anything to stop feeling this way... 

Will therapy truly help? Is there any other thing I could try besides the basic ""find a new hobby"" or ""go out with a friend"" or ""smoke some weed"", i've exhausted most of everything I could think of at this point that I thought would help me feel better but nothing so far has worked.

It's like my life won't stop going down there. Whenever I do 'What feels right' that inevitably leads to disaster. I eat healthy, read, meditate, yet can not stop this self destruction. 

This all comes back to love.. Why can't I find it?  I have tried online, with some dating successes. Yet it's absolutely brutal matching with women only to have them ignore you. Or swiping yes/messaging on what you think would be a good match to never hear from them. So to hide my fragile ego I cover it up with casual sex and inappropriate online dating.. Because if I am not really trying they can't be rejecting the real me right? And who am I to think I am better than that woman twice my size? Who am I to not be attracted to her.. I claim it's because I want someone interested in the same activities, but is it really?

It's a fight between my ego brain telling me to find a wife, 9-5, make kids and shut up. Yet that doesn't feel right inside... Trusting my inner feelings has never been easy for me. As an alcoholic, trusting feelings lead to not so great times. Or is it that incogruence between mind and heart where I fall? 

Living a life slightly outside of the norms is just becoming too much. Do I give up?  I have spent time in therapy, just made me feel worse.  I... Just can't take it anymore. I can't take hating myself. But why the hell would I love myself...",07Dec2019,1

Over a year ago I told my mom I was suicidal (I was in such a bad place) in hopes of being able to get some help, but she told me she didnt think I needed therapy and that I created my own problems in my head. My best friends know about my mental health but at this moment I really dont feel like they care. I'm falling into that bad place again and I just zone out these days thinking about killing myself and how that would solve everything. I probably just sound like another attention starved teenager but idk. I feel like they all know I want to die but no one cares much to comfort me. I dont see my friends often so I spend most of my days speaking to no one and I'm not very close with my mom, and after how she reacted to what I told her I really dont feel comfortable talking to her about anything. I just wish there was someone who took the time *actually* talk to me and let me know they want me alive. I want someone to show that they love me and was just there to comfort me in times like this. I dont want to tell anyone I'm suicidal again because I dont want to risk being taken to a hospital or to worry my friends. I dont know what to do. I just wish someone was here to make me feel better. I dont know how to comfort myself at this moment and these days nothing makes me happy anymore.

34,"It's common knowledge among a lot of people that your sense of smell is considered your strongest sense tied to memory, and many of us have smelled something that took us back to that happy nostalgic childhood feeling. It's one of those smells that makes you want to close your eyes, take in a deep breath, and hold onto it as long as possible as you think back on positive and happy memories. 

But what about a smell you can't quite place, but it instantaneously gives you an uneasy and almost scared or uncomfortable feeling? Today as I exited the elevator at work, I randomly got a whiff of some sort of perfume or something that instantly gave me anxiety. I felt like it triggered something from my childhood, but I never could place it. I  had a somewhat traumatic childhood, and I wonder if it is some sort of memory I can't quite recall but I know it makes me feel bad. Was it someone who did something abusive or mean to me? Said something awful to me? Or someone who just gave me a bad feeling as a child? 

I hear people often talking about the good smells and being reminded of the fun times of growing up, but I haven't really heard anyone talk about the bad. Has this happened to you? What was the smell or the memory associated?",07Dec2019,1

What disturbed me most was the crowd of students filming it while the kid was rolled in a ball form being beaten by the bully.  I would have went in the middle and ended the assault.  I can't process why people felt okay standing by letting it happen. The Mom of the child came out with a post explaining what had happen. That was the 3rd time that week that her child had been beaten up by the bully. The 'reason' she said within the post was: ""Because he acts gay"" in the post she also explained that he had attempted suicide at 13.

It’s been really good for me in a lot of ways, but I’ve found myself incessantly comparing myself to anything and everything else. Obviously... it’s natural to compare a little, even if not healthy, but I’m talking everything. It’s embarrassing to admit, but I’ll compare myself to like... D&amp;D characters and Tarzan and anyone we see out and about and everything. And I always lose! Against everyone. Like... I genuinely will find myself thinking she’d be happier with literally anyone else.

She has been talking about feeling emotion far less than she used to. A lot of the people at the school she goes to bully her and alienate her. She loves drawing and is incredibly good at art for her age, but the people at her school have been making fun of her for that too and telling her that all her art is shit and she’ll never improve.
Back when she was 4, her dad used to hit her out of anger, this stopped when she was 6 but it has scared her for life. Her dad is still highly abusive towards her, he calls her fat (I’m really worried that she might be starting to starve herself) he takes her stuff, he yells t her, he threatens to kick down her door and beat her. 
Both her parents are super anti VAX, they think that getting vaccines will kill you, she has only ever gotten one shot when she was 4, Wich was for measles.
None of her clothes fit her properly because her parents don’t want to get her new ones, they never have very much food in their house, despite both her parents having well paying jobs. She is vegetarian and I think she is extremely low in iron ( she has talked about experiencing the symptoms of low iron, and being vegetarian dosnt help.) she doesn’t have access to the medical or dental services that she needs. 
Her dad keeps on calling her a fat pig and it has severely impacted her self esteem. She thinks that she’s fat and ugly but she’s really not. I’m really worried that she’s denying herself food. She has talked about going full days without eating, she does this often. 
I think that she should get a blood test to see if she should be taking supplements for anything, but she’s scared to ask her parents cos she thinks they’ll make fun of her.
She has very few friends at the school that she goes to and she just wants to get away from her parents and where she lives, she has asked her parents if she can move in with me but her mum just guilt trips her into staying.
I’m really really worried about her, but I have no idea how to help her from where I live.  Please help me, I fucking hate knowing that she has to go through this shit every single day.

I used to be ecstatic about hanging out with friends and meeting new people and forming bonds but it just feels so pointless now, I don't want to be alone yet I don't want to be around people. Generally I feel misunderstood. I have no motivation or aspirations, all I care about it sleeping and hoping that I don't wake up one day, everything feels so fake. In my darkest times nobody has ever been there for me, i've just gotten used to supporting myself and it's a full-time job that I want to quit. 

I've suffered with melancholic depression in the past to paint some context, but it's certainly nothing like how I feel now. Just empty and emotionless. I'm not harming anyone with my behaviour and yet I always feel so utilized by people and it makes me sick, I want to feel better and be better but it ultimately feels pointless because I'm at my core an introvert and an outcast, I want furfilment but I feel it's an impossible task, it's like one day a switch flipped and it's stuck.",07Dec2019,1

42,"I want to be a mental health nurse, however I have been diagnosed with the big ol' depression and anxiety, and also OCD (I subconsciously bite my nails whenever I am anxious or stressed). I have refused to take Fluoxetine that has been prescribed to me because my life is jam-packed with work, I cannot afford to put aside 2-4 weeks to deal with side effects. I have been using other ways to manage my symptoms (reforming my thoughts, journaling, distracting myself with activities, talking / hanging out with friends, getting advice from reddit 😏) but sometimss I do spontaneously cry for no reason, and oftentimes fail to see the purpose of all that I am doing. Unfortunately I am an international student in a foreign country, so I am not able to afford therapy. The closest thing I have to therapy is the university counsellor, who I have good rapport with. 

I am wondering if being a mental health nurse is far out of my reach. I am studying to be an RN, so once I graduate I will be qualified, but I am not sure if I also have to be perfectly mentally healthy. I am unsure of how long that may take.

45,"I'm male and 14. I don't feel many emotions, and the ones I do have are toward self-preservation only. I don't care about other people past the level where I do what I need to in order to stay in a safe home.

I had a messed up childhood. I was born with a highish IQ and used to have strong emotions along with smarts, but I lost both over time leaving me as an empty shell. I know that I deeply loved my mom, but I can't remember what that even feels like now. She was a bad person though. I was sexually abused by several men, and my mom didn't care because they paid her and gave her cigarettes. It wasn't until I was mauled by her boyfriend's Rottweiler when I was 4 that she was arrested for neglect and had her rights terminated.

I lived in foster care where I was lonely and abused. Something clicked in me there when I was 5 where I realized I could create my own reality in daydreams and I didn't need anyone else.

I got adopted by the foster parents of my fourth placement, when I was 8. I've never loved anyone in my new family or enjoyed being around them in all this time. When I spend time with my adoptive brother, it's always for my need or enjoyment and not his. He cries and gets sad all the time, and I just wish he would shut up. 

The worst thing I did in my life was one time I was hiking with just my brother when I was 14 and he was 12. He tripped and rolled down a hill and broke his arm. I just left him there because I couldn't see an easy way to get down to where he was. I only got help because I thought I'd get put back in foster care if he died.

So, for a little which now, I’ve just been feeling pretty bad lately, but I never really talk to anyone about it because I don’t want to bother them with how I’m feeling, and so I just internalise it even though it isn’t healthy. Lately though, I’ve been wanting people to care about me though, and like, not feel bad for me, but just like, be there for me and help me feel better if that makes sense. I’ve been trying to hunt at me not feeling good, which I don’t like doing because I feel like I’m bad for not feeling good, and because if this, if someone asks me if I’m doing ok when I’m hinting I’m not, I just say that I’m fine and just tired, but I don’t want to say that, I just don’t want to bother people with my problems. For some reason, I only want certain people to know I’m not feeling good, but I feel guilty for that because I don’t want to push anything onto them even if it makes me feel worse.

I constantly feel worthless, have a hard time with socializing, hate how this world works, and think about how great things would be if I were dead. The whole ""family/friends will be sad"", ""permanent solution/temporary problem"", and other cookie cutter responses don't help.  

I thought I'd finally tell my doctor about my feelings so that I could get some closure about what's wrong with me. I wrote down my grievances in preparations for the appointment, although I think its a bit long(about 2+ pages). 

But now as the day comes closer, I feel scared and think about cancelling it. Years ago, I had a relative who attempted suicide and she was told that she either had to spend time at an asylum(I know that's not the proper name, but that's the atmosphere it gave) or go to jail. I don't want to go through the courage of talking to someone only to be incarcerated. And if I get put in an asylum, I don't know if I'll be able to notify my employers in time to avoid getting fired. I'm already having a hard time finding a 2nd job, I can't lose my current one.

52,"Hey everyone, so I don't really know how to start this off. I guess I'll say that I'm 13 years old and I'm wondering if I have ADHD. I've been looking at symptoms and doing those tests online, and I've been thinking about it for some time, but I'm seriously thinking about it now. I'm asking here because I don't know where else to ask and I'm afraid of if I don't have it, because I'd be embarrassed (I guess that might seem dumb but that's just me) if I was like one of those people who are like ""omg i get distracted sometimes i totally have adhd"", you know? well I don't really know what to say, so I guess I'll give a bunch of info, some of which might be irrelevant, but I'm really unsure. Here it is:
-I often forget to do my homework and end up doing it in school, and I am a really bsd procrastinator. My English teacher gives us 10 ""reading journals"" to do each month and last year (7th grade, same teacher, does this with all his classes) I handed them it for the month once, and it was just near the end of the year and the accumulation of all of the ones I worked on without doing enough (still was only like 8 journals).
-I'm prone to suddenly getting like REALLY angry seemingly out of nowhere, due to very small things. For example, I think maybe yesterday or something, while sitting down I noticed my friend sit in a position where he was touching me, so I scooted away, and he scooted near me again, I moved again, he moved closer, I moved again, he moved toward me again and I got so pissed I loudly YELLED something like ""StOp MoViNg NeXt To Me!!!"" and I immediately felt bad about it.
-I'm not sure how often I do this, but often enough that I notice, I go somewhere to do something, then do something else, leave, and realize I didn't do what I went there to do. For instance, I go to the kitchen to get like my phone or something, I get a glass of water, leave ""oh yeah my phone"".
-I don't really have trouble paying attention when talking to people and I can sit still for a while as ling as I'm not bored (during basically any test i think i slowly lose my sanity the longer it takes to finish). This is mainly why I'm afraid that I don't have it
-Maybe it's weird that I WANT to have ADHD, but it's not like being diagnosed with it would change me for the worse, and it would explain a lot about myself.
-I tend to fidget a lot while sitting or laying down. Not like I feel like I have to get up and move, more like I feel like I have to just move. Usually I move my leg up and down, as in I do thst 90% of the time I'm sitting, sometimes, but rarely, I tap my fingers on a desk, my lap.
-I'm really impulsive. If I find something I find interesting, I'll go crazy about it, research it, love it, then in a week I'm like, nah that's boring, and sometimes I say things or do things that will get me in trouble simply because I don't want to NOT do them I guess. Like slapping a water bottle out of someone's hand. Usually though, it's not that bad, and not that often.
-I get bored a LOT.
-I've had glasses for like 1 week maybe, and after the ""woah glasses cool"" thing began to wear off, I've begun to become more and more forgetful on the fact that I actually need to wear them. I USUALLY remember to put them on, though.

If you have any other questions, I can answer them. It's pretty late for me so I may go to bed soon, but I don't know when. If I don't respond that's why, but I'll be here tomorrow too. If you can help at all, THANK YOU sooo much, for like any help at all. I'm sorry I wrote too much, but I had a lot to talk about. I don't know if I made it seem too much like I have ADHD symptoms or too little, but really, if I'm being too vague, I'll tell you more if you ask. Thank you, and goodbye.",07Dec2019,1

Also TW: mention of suicide threats and selfharm

So, i have a grandmother on my fathers side who strikes me as, idk, not okay? She is very manipulative and hates when things dont go her way. For example she stalked and almost drove my uncle into madness because she did not approve of his girlfriend, he ended up having a mental breakdown in which he injured himself and had to be ran into the ER.She would call him non stop and stating that she already bought razor blades/filled up her bathtub etc. She also treathened with suicide when my brother (when he was a kid) would leave earlier than she wanted him to.Grandma would really run out to the balcony while he went outside and shout something like ""Dont go otherwise i might hurt myself""
 She frequently throws temper tantrums and generally has a short temper (she also takes absolutely everything as a personal attack). And thats not even everything terrible she ever did: honestly, if i would describe every manipulative thing she ever did, i would have to write a novel.....
What also strikes me as odd is that my father barely ever talked about his childhood. What i know for sure though, is that when my mom started to date him during college he would selfharm by putting cigarettes in his palms out and also frequently throw temper tantrums where he usually breaks everything in his surroundings. He still does that sometimes but its no longer than extreme as is used to be (sometimes he still completely wrecks his laptop or phone tho)
I dont know if its mental illness, my mother believes that my grandmother just has a ""terrible personality"" but i honestly dont know. My brother is sure that she suffers from a mental illness, but she honestly does not strike me as mentally ill?

58,Hey guys so I am a Junior in high school and like a majority of guys my age I masturbate a couple times a week. Now I feel extremely guilty and sad after. I think of myself as a failure and am just sad. I am also Jewish and part of Jewish law says that spilling seed is against the Torah. I have these thoughts that I will be punished and sent to hell. They freak me out and it’s getting to the point were I am terrified. I can go a couple of days without doing it but I always end up failing. This might seem like a silly thing to talk about but I think it is serious. Please give suggestions thanks,07Dec2019,1
59,"And yes, that’s my refuge. I feel a lot better when I’m playing games and using my character. My real life is just non sense. I didn’t came to this world to make money. I lost my interest for having a job. Im a very dependent person and that was one of my early mistakes in this life. I can not count so many days being sober. And for worse, I’m living in a hard country that I feel like it’s really boring. I’m just going to bed early during night and this is the best moment of the day. My nicest friends are plushies and at least they sleep with me genuinely. Yes, that’s my life.",07Dec2019,1
60,"I dont really know where to start, or what the point of any of this will be tomorrow. I cant remember feelings very well, sometimes it is a couple of days until I forgot how something felt, other times it just takes losing my train of thought. Either way, the end result is the same, I dont for feel anything that isnt NOW.

But for this 'now', I hate me, again, and I'm afraid that, yet again, the pain will fade too quickly for me to try and change - if it is even possible.

I don't know what is important to mention so if you feel like I am rambling and don't want to deal with it, by all means, move on.

I was raised/beaten into a dark form of Christianity, and I happily regurgitated it on those around me into my early 20's. I should have known something was wrong with all the nightmares growing up about heaven, but it wasn't until I met my wife that I grew threw this. I know the definition of shame, and I think thay if I were to be asked, I would say that my time as a youth minister should be the most shameful experience of my life.

Until I was 25 and had a full spectrum revaccination I had no reliable record of vaccinations, my mother would steal vials from work and inject us with whatever it was she brought home.

Around 11 I hurt animals.

Around 13 I was sexually abused by extended family and family friends. Due to my zealous upbringing, I did not even know the meaning of an erection.

I stopped hurting animals around that time, and started hurting people. It started with computer fraud, at 14 I was the most productive member of a social engineering group that preyed on the newness of the internet. AOL was still around and was one of the most insecure platforms at the time.

At 16 I was in multiple violent altercations, and my behavior grew to include arsony, assault, grand theft, and attempted murder.

The boy I tried to kill was a 'bully' who targeted me and others for being quiet and passive. He deserved it, and I wouldn't apologize even if I wasn't pulled off of him before I succeeded.

During this whole time my father poured all my mothers money (she always held more .arketable jobs) into various MLM schemes. We ate little, but it was always what he wanted, and most of us kids were sick nightly from the grease and underprepared foods.

If the house wasnt perfectly clean, it was because we didnt care if our mother died.

If we did something wrong, it was god's decision to beat us with metal studded whips.

If we did something right, it was god and not us.

I was a freshman for 3.5 years because being around other people was painful. The only friends I had were two girls, one who was my friend to hang out with my brother, the other pretended t9 be my girlfriend so she and my sister would jot get 'caught.' I graduated on time by clepping classes in night school. 

My 4th year I was carjacked at gunpoint. It was my fault for trying to reenact the good samaritan, I was subpoened (forced to show up in court), as the victim, to watch the judge let the guy go. He was 17 1/2 years old I was his second victim, and 10-20-Life is a fucking joke.

A year later I received a letter from the courts saying he had been arrested and placed in jail, not for his crimes against me and his other victim, but for mot paying his court fees. 

 After I graduated I moved to Miami for culinary school. I was good at it, and the fast paced work meant I didnt have to feign direct human interaction too much. I could only afford to eat by paying the one dollar entrance fee to a bingo hall. If I didnt have a chance to steal food from school, the bingo hall was my only option.

In Miami, my room mate attacked me with a knife for my, still brainwashed, political views. My parents, oblivous to this altercation, tell me that I need to move back home to help them keep their house, and I listened.

They were fine.

At 19 I joined the marines, during bootcamp my parents continuously sent me letters about how awful thongs were - family members getting injured, about to lose the house again, etc. Near the same time a bunch of kids were forced into sexual interactions by a drill instructor.

I took advantage of the situation to use my history of abuse and social engineering skills to serve as a witness against this piece of shit. He was kicked out for his actions and I so was I, for outting it. 

I have never been trusted by any deparment of our federal government again, and my parents were still liars.

At this point the only way my mother could tolerate her life was with stolen prescriptions and alcohol. During one of her episodes she told my father that I was sexually abusing my sisters. Not only had this never happened, I had not done more than kissing an obviously disgusted lesbian to keep her and my sisters secret. 

I was 21 and dropped all contact with my entire family for several years. 

I started dating my now wife around the time of this incident and after a few months of homelessness she helped me find a new place to live.

She showed me that goodness did not depend on religion. That family is not determined by DNA alone. That I could talk out the things in my mind without fear of being excised. 

The only lie that she has ever told me is that I could be possibly be okay one day.

She joined the military, was forced to work 16 hour days when she was 8 months pregnant. So we filed for a separation due to pregnancy which is supposed to be all8w the mother to still give birth on base for her service.  They refused to let her on base 2 weeks before she gave birth, our sole income at the time was my 13/hr for being a debt collector. We were not prepared for their betrayel and 15,000 dollars in medical expenses for her birth. They ruined us for years, to the point that I was working 14-16 hour days and selling plasma twice a week. I ate canned beans behind my wifes back so that her and our daughter could have the things they needed. I biked year round, including snowy winters, to save on car expenses, while my wife suffered, virtually alone, through post partem depression.

For the first 3 years of my daughters life I puked and shit blood in secret. In the winters we could only afford to heat a closet sized room that my wife and daughter slept in. I slept on the couch, clothed in multiple layers and shaking off the frost in the morning.

In 2015 it got to the point where my wife and daughter had to fly across country to stay with her family while I stayed back, living in our vehicle until I could find a job to move.

Most would say the luckiest time in our lives was about to start.

I had 'proved' some technical skills at my job and was moved into our IT department.

Putting my hacking and social engineering skills to work for the state government had paid off and they offered my a job in software development. I immediately used this to look for a job back east where my wife and daughter were.

If it wasnt for conning people, I would not know how to interact with people at all, and that makes everything seem illegitimate.

Over the next 6 months I went from 13/hr to 65/hr skipping the whole promotion pathway to veing a senior software engineer with no steps between it and being a debt collector.

At 2019, we're still recovering from some bills from poverty, but we are not worried like in the past. My wife and daughter are well, and I am the top peformer on my team and in the top bracket across our entire company.

None of it matters. 
Im not proud of any of it. 
I dont feel good about any of it.
I feel less now than as a kid, and those feelings fade quicker.


Before I got the IT job I made a deal that if i didnt earn a 6 figure salary by the time I was 30 that I would kill myself. All the debt was in my name, I had life insurance, and I drew up instructions to my wife, and letters to my daughter if she wanted them as she grew up. It would better for them than a deadbeat.

I beat the deadline by 2 weeks.

Another deal was made for 7 figures by 35. It is the only thing I've ever wanted to fail at, but now my daughter is old enough that it would have a noticeable affect and I did not account for that.

I've forgotten whatever coping mechanisms I may have had in my youth, and I am lost. But I know it and everything else will disappear into a vaguely neutral idea with no emotional connection.

I struggle with working in such a white collar environment. Everyone is lazy, can barely perform their job function, and all I can picture is them on the perfect vacations they always talk about while at the same time I was prying tin cans open in the back of my car with a knife while my wife and daughter were 3000 miles away. 

They disgust me, but that fades too.

What happens when I am away from my family long enough to lose that connection?

What happens when I can no longer bury these episodes in drugs and alcohol until theu go away.

I feel nothing until I feel everything and it is just getting to be too much. 

I know my proclivities for violence. I've seen how far across the line I can go and I know even if I went too far that it too would fade.

Antidepressants and antipsychotics make the hollowness unbareable.

Psychadelics have helped in the past, but I've hit a series of sessions that have been more detrimental than beneficial so I am not sure about continuing, and weed sedates me, but I struggle with weight gain on it; which just ultimately makes me feel worse.

Even this is starting to fade now, a dual sensation of a rare moment of humanity clouded by how much I hate every feeling I experience.

Am I what is left when it goes away or am I the feeling that keeps fading away?

How long am I obligated to deal with this before my daughter is old enough to recover?

What other options exist, and how do I stay motivated when it all fades away?",07Dec2019,1

So I've been thinking about this for a while now, but im seriosly considering it now. Ill give abunch of background even if some is unnecessary, hoping its enough info for anyone to help:

-im thirteen
-I fidget 90% of the time while sitting and laying down, usually moving my leg or hand, but im fine sitting for a long time as long as im engaged in a task and comfortable (one reason im afraid i dont have adhd)
-im pretty good with paying attention to people when they're talking to me, i can usually focus when speaking directly to people and stuff (another reason im afraid i don't have adhd)
-i am a very very bad procrastinator. for ela (8th grade) our english teacher (who we had in 7th too) gives us these ""reading journals"" we have to do, 10 by the end of every month, and i have INCREDIBLE difficulty with this task. in the seventh grade he did this too and i never did them, but thus year im rrslly really trying, though its only because he gave me an extension if i do more of them, and im still extremely stressed. he hasnt asked about it even though it was due last week, i wad planning on giving it then, but i havent because im scared hell say its too late and i didnt hand it un BeFoRe because i forgot and he hasn't mentioned it (i already said that). but yeah its really bad. i also almost always do my homework last minute, if i dont finish it the moment its assigned. i have really poor time management and cant spread out work
-i dont know how often i do this, but often enough that i notice, i go somewhere to do somethings then dk something else, lease without accomplishing my original task, and realize it and have to go back
-im prone to getting really angry over small details, lashing out at people, and immediately regretting it
i know it may be kinda weird that im HOPING i have ADHD but it would explain a lot about me if i did have it, i guess

theres other stuff but im low on time and have to go to sleep. any help is COLOSSALLY appreciated and i can answer any questions you ask tomorrow when i wake up. thank you so much for your time everyone.",07Dec2019,1
62,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this. And sorry if it reads all over the place as my thoughts are put to text.

Ever since I was 16 I have wanted a family. I want to be married and 2 kids by 22 like my parents. But that hasn't happened which I am happy and sad about. 

Sad because with each passing month and year it eats away at me more and more. Which doesn't help with my anxiety and depression.

Happy because, I have this amazing partner who is extremely supportive and we both want the same thing and have a family with him makes me even happier then I though possible. My partner and I talk about all this a lot and he is the more logical one of us who is always making sure that we both understand the financial stress that these things add and reassures me that we have this all and more.

I guess my thing is that I get more depressed and anxious with every month that goes by that I am not engaged or pregnant. And it's a double edged sword that what if I get pregnant and my depression gets worse, or something bad happens and I just break. And also get more nervous of the amount of pressure I am adding to my partner everytime I breakdown because some mentions our age or some we know get engaged, married or pregnant.

63,"Are we in hell? I have a weird feeling like my life is a punishment. I came up with this idea about a year ago, but it's stuck with me every once in a while. And now it's getting scary and I'm starting to believe it. I'm also starting to get scared of the suicidal thoughts I'm having.

All I've done in my life is go through emotional distress, sadness, betrayal, more betrayal, trust and then betrayal, self hatred, feeling unworthy, below others, feeling like ""why me"" because of all the trauma, violence, emotional turmoil, emotional abuse, verbal abuse, targeted harassment, bullying, exclusion, right down to the tiniest of adversities in life.

It feels like even when I'm having ""fun"" I'm not really having fun, I'm just doing the best I can to *do* something. In other words, I don't have fun, it's an illusion and I'm in hell. I have a terrible fear of other people and often feel like they're gonna take me and hurt me and that plagues my friendships and romantic relationships when they begin. 

I feel like I live in psychological hell - like my own personal hell is the one I'm living in now. On top of consistently finding myself at the bottom of the social tier, I am not attractive, not charming or cute, not funny, I'm a ghost. I'm an uninteresting weird person and I live in this world of isolation and being an outcast.

65,"I need to talk, not with someone that knows me, the last thing I need is for anyone to tell my family.

I'm currently living with my parents right now to help save myself money while paying off my student loans. I sincerely regret this decision. 

Some backstory: my parents have had some rough years when I was a teen. My dad was an alcoholic and enjoyed going to off road competitions a few times a year. My older brother was an ass as a teen and yelled at everyone. Because of these things my mom and dad always got into constant arguing in the evenings. No matter where you went in the house you could hear it. I love them, I really do, but it took a toll on me hearing them. I ended up developing this problem where I would hear people arguing at night, but everyone is asleep, or I would hear the tv and think they were yelling again. This stopped some time after I went to college and lived with my brother for a bit.

I still kept in contact with them, seeing how everything was going. From what they had told me they were doing better. Dad didn't drink recklessly anymore, they were attending couple's therapy. Besides my mom being diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis it seemed like things were getting better. They even invited me to move back in when rent became too high. I thought it would be a fresh start. I would find a decent job, be with my parents, and be happy for a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

I was so stupid I swear to god I couldn't believe I fell for that.

&amp;#x200B;

They still fight, still yell at eachother. Mom refuses to attend therapy anymore, she quit her job due to having MS, and just sits watching dr.Phil or Blacklist all day complaining about MS pain and heavy legs. Dad works most of the day and then usually works in his workshop when he gets home. Dad tries hard to do things with mom but she always complains about being too tired; though that hasn't stopped her from going out with me to places. She gets mad at dad and thinks he's trying to avoid her.

Tonight was the worst I heard so far. This time because dad wants to go do some things on his own or with friends, but mom wants more time with him because he's so busy during the week. Only problem is they never fucking communicate before hand. Mom just thinks that dad will be okay doing something on the weekend without telling him, and dad just wants to go to a basketball game. And mom doesn't know when to stop. An hour, an hour of yelling at eachother ""Stop! Just stop!"", ""I don't know what to do anymore!"", ""This is giving me a heart attack!"", ""We've been doing this for two years this has to stop!"" from both mom and dad. You can hear it everywhere in the house as always. 

Then mom comes into my room to apologize to me and give me her side of the story. It got real awkward when dad came into my room while she was still talking. Luckily he just said ""she's a smart girl, she knows what was said. If she wants to hear your side of the story that's fine"", and left. Mom tried to talk to him more but I told her to drop it. I had enough yelling tonight.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that you're all caught up; it's been happening again where I can hear them arguing at night but they're both asleep. I can't take hearing shit that isn't even real! I don't know what to do anymore. Hearing them yell during the day is bad enough I don't want to hear hallucinations too. I don't have the money to live on my own yet so I have to live with them right now. I know someday I will get out of here, I just needed to talk.",07Dec2019,1
66,"If I hear something about someone or if I think of a scary thought, I have the ability to believe that it’s true for me to.

For instance I saw a video on hair loss, and immediately now I think I’m loosing hair. Even though I can’t see any loss and all my grandparents and father have still no bold spots of hair up to their 90’s. It’s so bad that I am considering shaving my head to double check my hair line. 

But this is just a funny example. This illness gets worse when it comes to other thoughts that most people think during their life time, but don’t put any weight on. While I do.

For example years ago the thought of being gay just struck my mind for no real reason. And this made me scared more than usual, because of this illness I have. After years I figured out that I’m not gay, I never found any attraction to the same sex. Now, even though I’m sertain of my sexuality, this fear has not left, and it ruins my possibility to interact with girls.

68,"I recently took a significant amount of anesthetic while in the process of killing myself.  This medication is prescribed to me, though in a much smaller dose than what I took that morning.  Once the medication took effect, I got completely lost in hallucinations.  I have been close to dying before, though this was my first Near Death Experience (NDE).

The hallucinations were scary at first.  I didn't understand what was happening, or how to make sense of the world breaking apart.  I sat with my doctor, who is still alive, and spoke about how I felt watching a movie of the previous few hours of my life.  He had to go, and that is when I left my body which, along with everything else, dissolved into the most beautiful image.  I saw Time.  Time was made of ""tubes"" of the most gorgeous colours, dancing with each other as far as I could see.  I felt calm, and such tremendous peace.

Ever since I regained awareness, I have been miserable.

I want to go back.  I want to be with the colours.  I want to see the expanse of time.  I want to be free.

Honestly, a completed suicide is a small price to pay.

 My hesitation is entirely based on how relieved everyone was that I survived.  So many people cried once I was medically cleared and they were confident I was back in the land of the living.  I cannot survive the next attempt.  I hurt them too much last time.

I [18 F] have some issues I never seemed to have in the past, and I don’t know where they’re coming from.
I’m usually a very well organized, very hard working and persevering, motivated person. 
I’m a third year art schooler studying filmmaking and I very recently started working as a waitress in a bar (a job I really like). 

So now for the issue.
I have no idea why or how, but all of this kind of collapsed in the last few weeks.

I can’t wake up on time properly anymore, although I used to get up immediately after my alarm rang. I’m not exaggerating, I would be in the shower 2 minutes after I turned it off.

I can’t remember schedules or dates anymore. I never had to write them down before, as long as it wasn’t more than 3-4 weeks away, I always remembered them flawlessly. 

I can’t work like I used to. My productivity has went down drastically, I find it difficult to get to work, keep working and keep my focus. Stuff that I never had an issue with. I also completely forgot about some things I had to do until I was reminded by a friend.

And finally my motivation overall has went down. I used to paint a lot (I needed paintings for a short film) and I literally don’t want to anymore. I haven’t painted in 3 weeks. 
I’m also extremely tired, but this might be because I finish work at 00:00 two week days in a row.

So here I am, torn to pieces. I’m trying to tell her we can fix her health together, but she insists she needs to do it on her own. She needs a break. But not the normal break, she needs a full break, a break up. She needs to not feel any commitment to me, to be able to just focus on her self. And therefore a break is not good enough. 

We had plans on moving out together in a month, and now all my plans for the future is gone, reduced to atoms. 

Her mental health problems are depression and anxiety. The reason she needs a break, is because we havn’t really been good at making her better, (I haven’t been good enough.) She needs to go out, have fun, be active, to improove her health. And we have mostly been watching netflix and stayed in bed when we were together. But this time things was supposed to be different, we were supposed to move out together and start our life for real. She has lost all hope in us beging able to fix this together, and is taking it upon herself.

And when she is better, if she gets better. We might try again. See if we can start over, with a better mental state. 

However, thats what she wants. I want to try to fix things together. I KNOW we can, but she doesn’t feel the same.

I decided tonight I wasn’t going to get someone a Christmas gift because shipping on a candle was $4 and this is when I’ve decided I need to ask for help and advice. 
Not to write a whole monologue but here’s a little information about me

I’m a college student who lives at home works 25-30 hours a week because I feel like I need to be making money to save for the future. College is completely paid for by academic scholarship and I live in the middle of nowhere farm-town.

I come from a upper middle class family who is extremely conservative and frugal when it comes to everything but isn’t afraid to spend money on vacations or something fancy. 
Never in my life have I had to worry about money and I am extremely blessed for this and the jobs my family has. 

Am I an ungrateful brat and don’t know what it’s like to provide for myself and I feel like that fear is consuming me and I work and save every dollar to cope with the fear?

I limit myself with how much money I spend in a week under $50 and check every couple days that I’ve got enough hours to go double my income vs estimated spending for the month but this paranoia is exhausting and I’m sick of not being able to just do something and not worrying about what is going to replace the $30 in my checking account when I go out for the night of bowling with my buddies or to a dinner date with my girlfriend.
Any advice or comments are appreciated, I’m just so sick of being paranoid about money and working all the time as a student but I can’t just stop working because I need to save for when I finish school and want to get an apartment and if the market is bad I might not be able to get a job in my computer science major and then I couldn’t pay rent or for my car and I need the savings just Incase and the extra few dollars times 15 or 20 in a year is a few hundred and over 3 years that’s a few thousand dollars and this all makes logical sense to me and it’s tearing me down

Any ideas what’s going on here or how to get her help secretly? Because when anyone tries to help her/message her she accuses them of bullying. She’s the child of very wealthy parents with very good jobs yet she post crazy things on social media and socially isolated herself

-waking up in the middle of the night
-forgetful
-easily annoyed or angry
-spending hours focused on perfecting an art project
-can’t focus on project for career
-not really doing any professional development

I’m worried it’s dementia because of my head injury in 2005. It could be stress from applying to jobs &amp; not getting anywhere. I also forgot to take my medication for several weeks so it could be side effects of starting again. Or isolation, I’m not socializing with anyone.",07Dec2019,1

That’s it.

Now I feel empty. I’m not sure if it’s because of the fact that I accomplished everything I set out to and now there’s NOTHING ELSE. Maybe I’m just drunk. Or maybe this is a microcosm or my ENTIRE LIFE; maybe all there is to living is wanting things—to improve, or to achieve, or to acquire—and when you get that THERE’S NOTHING LEFT AND YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE DEAD. Like, fuck. 

I’m not killing myself right now because there’s stuff on my bucket list and hopefully I’ll feel different once I check some of those boxes.  But my fear is that no matter what I do it’s not enough to fill this stupid-ass void.

86,"I'm new-ish to Reddit and I'm not sure if I should post here but I wanted to reach out for some advice or to see if anyone has had a similar experience. Sorry if this is a bit long. 

For a little while now, I've felt as though my brain has been playing tricks on me. It sort of started with general forgetfulness, where I'd forget conversations I had with friends the day before or other things that I had recently said to someone. I felt like my friends were pranking me for a while - I thought for sure they were the ones remembering it wrong. Eventually, however, it became clear that I was starting to misremember things and that I'd created half-correct memories. I just put that down to the stress of graduating high school and entering the workforce. Except, some other things were harder to brush aside. 

There was one instance where I failed to recognise my own cat even though he was right in front of me. For context, we live on a small farm where a lot of stray cats wander through our property from open fields. Although, these cats are quite feral (and very distinctive in how they look, most are black/white so they're very different from my tabby) and don't approach the house if they can avoid it. Normally, if they see me they take off sprinting into the sunset. That's why I was so surprised when one day a 'stray cat'  boldly walked past me, through the cat door, and started eating cat biscuits from the pet bowl. Honestly, I stared at it for about five minutes eating from the cat bowl and crept up to it slowly just so utterly confused and worried. I was worried that this was a regular occurrence and that secretly it was eating all of my cat's food when I wasn't looking. Well... that was until it clicked with me. Suddenly, it felt like two wires in my head had been reconnected because IT WAS MY CAT!!! There was absolutely nothing different with him, he didn't act or look strange and looked nothing like the stray cats outside. It was as if he'd been erased from my mind momentarily until it all flooded back in. That a very strange experience.

In the past, I've had a few hypnagogic auditory hallucinations where I've heard vividly heard people talking to me as I drift off to sleep, but it's always nice things so I guess thanks brain? :) I found it funny because one night after a big event my friend and I had hypnagogic hallucinations both on the same night. I woke up and texted her that I heard her saying something to me just before I went to sleep and she replied that she heard my voice telling her something! Hopefully all nice things, my disembodied voice better not ruin any friendships haha. 

Some other strange things have been that I've started to twitch around dinnertime/eating food and that once I failed to understand a couple who natively speak english (as do I) that are from the same place that I am. At first I was like woah that's cool, I didn't know they spoke another language... but they didn't... it was plain English! The weirdest of all of these experiences however happened last night. For a few weeks I know that I've been seeing things that aren't there. Just little flashes out of my periphery, always very short and sudden - not anything particularly scary just strange. But last night I think I had two visual hallucination? I'm not entirely sure.

The first : Around 9pm I was walking from the kitchen into the living room and just when I walked past the doorframe I thought I saw my cat run in front of my underneath my legs. It was quite fast so the motion was more of a blur but I still attempted to step over him. Just as I put my foot down on the ground and looked around I realised that there was no cat in sight (he ended up coming into the house through the cat door about ten minutes later). Again, it wasn't scary it was just odd and such a convincing cat shape that it made me try to step around it. Even if it was him, the living room was pretty clear of furniture so he could not have hidden himself in such a quick dash. 

The second: It was nearing 1am and I was just packing up my computer. I wasn't particularly tired at all that night and was definitely wide awake when I shut down my computer. Then all of a sudden there's another flash of movement across the screen and I see this humungous cockroach run along the keyboard. Instantly, I shoved the computer off of me onto the couch beside me and stared at it for a few seconds before inspecting it. THERE WAS NOTHING, not even a trace of a bug. One thing I must say is that I don't overly mind spiders but I absolutely despise cockroaches and it was horrifying to see this massive specimen for only a second. (We recently had the house sprayed too so there was no chance of a cockroach making it to the computer in the middle of the living room). Definitely the only strange occurrence that has genuinely frightened me.

Overall, whatever these things are, whether they are normal or not, they seem to be picking up in intensity slightly with each passing day. Thanks so much for reading this long winded spiel!!! I'm just quite unnerved by all these brain oddities. Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? Also professionals is there any signs here that suggest I should talk to someone about this? Genuinely curious. :)

Anyway regardless, I hope all of you lovelies have an awesome day and appreciate yourself, being a bit crazy is good for the soul haha.

95,"(before I start - this is just the observations of one person) 

&amp;#x200B;

This post is regarding the way that westerners are being told to be more open about their mental (ill) health. While obviously this is a great thing and nobody should ever suffer in silence, I believe there is a hidden danger that we're yet to address. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've met quite a few people throughout the past few years who seem to become obsessed with their psychological disorders. And in a way, they define their every thought and action in accordance with them. The original idea of letting your peers know that you're struggling so they can understand the reasons that your behaviour may be abnormal has changed into something much different.  A lot of people seem to become hyper-focused and expect their social worlds to revolve around them. This is absolutely no road to recovery and is probably extremely damaging. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really believe that under a lot of circumstances, talking in-depth about psychological problems to somebody who isn't a trained therapist (or clinical psychologist) could do more harm than it does good. It is so easy to see things in a fatalist manner when you're suffering, and to do that without the presence of a trained professional is taking a 'shot in the dark'. The attention a person gets when talking about mental health may even be rewarding, so they may unconsciously do it more until it becomes an obsession. Plus, this does start to affect the people they socialise with. If every social occasion becomes a therapy/vent session, the friends will soon enough realise that they're not enjoying their time around that person.

In short, friends are not therapists and people need to think less and do more. - A positive and social psychologist.",07Dec2019,1

98,"**Background on my mom**: My mom has a set of issues mostly arising from a bad parenting that left her in a poor state of mind including (my opinions, shared by some others) bipolar disorder, depression, excess materialism, excess desire to make everyone happy while ignoring herself. The bad parenting she received was mostly psychological abuse with instances of physical abuse but nothing crazy. She is now divorced from my father who is extremely narcissistic and controlling, but has good intentions. She has issues to address but is unwilling to get help. 

**Background of me**: Both parents have been wonderful to helping my brother and I become the best we can be despite their issues. I am very unemotional, somewhat controlling. When in a situation which may lead to either aggression or warmth/friendliness, I tend toward aggression. If angered or upset by someone, my immediate reflex is to physically fight them or remove them from the area; however, I do not allow myself to do do anything like that for a variety of reasons. Typically, I instead respond appropriately in conversation.

**Background of our dog**: He's well loved with lots of attention. We added two kittens to the family 3-4 months ago and he likes them very much. In situations where is in beleaguered state and situations in protection of his territory or property, he briefly turns into a monster before reverting (instantly in some cases) base to his friendly, puppy-like self.

so, we look at that dress again and sigh sadly. again. we climb on that scale, hoping to see something different from yesterday, but even if it is indeed different, it only makes us even more sad. or on our way from bathroom  to the bedroom we avoid glancing at our naked body in the mirror. or we do look at our naked body and we become even more sad. borderline depressed. this is not how we want to look. this is not us. we used be so toned, slender, so appealing. we used to fit into favorite clothing, we used to never even bother with fitting rooms, we would just grab our size and go, knowing that it will fit perfectly and will be fitting for the next several years.

when did it all start ? what does this belly represent ? what are these love handles storing ? what are these square thighs are carrying ? what do these bat wings hide ?

take a breath in, breathe out and scan your body from top to toes. can you feel the air at the edge of your nostrils ? can you feel your hair ? can you feel processes in your stomach ? can you feel energy at the lower abdomen ? can you feel pressure in your knees ? can you feel your toes ? can you feel the skin of your cheeks ? 

now, mentally ask a question: who is feeling all of these things ? 

now contemplate on the mere thought that you and your body are not one. you are not making your diaphragm to expand and collapse. you are not making your hair grow. you are not digesting your food. as you sit here and read those words, you are not making your eyes to read. 

when we hating something, it hates us back. what we resist - persists. if you are serious about getting back in shape, i want to ask you:  right now, can you try to love your body the way it is? all the imperfections, all the misshapes, all the flaws - can you accept them the way they are ? can you say: ""thank you, buddy!"" (pun intended) can you strike gently on the parts that you hate the most and say: ""forgive me, buddy"" ? can you feel gratitude and acceptance towards your silent buddy, who is doing all this hard work for you: breathing for you, digesting greasy McTrash for you, clearing up toxins that you inhale for you, silently listening to all the self-talk, all the neglect, all the energy that is swirling around ? can you see how much this buddy does for you ? can you appreciate it for a second ? can you see how lonely it's been, while you were caught up in the misery about it's looks ? can you sincerely apologize for all the liver rape, kidney abuse, lung suffocation, blood poisoning ? this buddy never did a single thing to you, but keeping you safe and sound. and when it started being tired, started being a little slow on metabolism, a little sluggish on the way upstairs, all it got is rejection and hate. please, right now, acknowledge your body for everything is has done for you and promise to never abuse it again. 

when you accept it and see the real reasons why is it the way it is, when you start taking responsibility for it's shape and form, you will see how incredibly fast it will change. love your buddy and trust your buddy and it will make you the most gorgeous You.

107,"It's dirty, you're dirty. How can you have order in your life when your room is complete chaos?

No, I say. I have far bigger fish to fry than the cleanliness of my room. What difference does it make whether the sock is on the floor or in the drawer? How exactly does that impact my mental well being and my life situation? I'm the logical one here, the arbitrary placement of physical objects around me does not impact my mental health. Even if it did, it would be so miniscule in comparison to the other issues weighing down my mind.

That's your problem, you think you're logical. Do you think you can create a mental picture/framework of your whole world along with what impacts you, what works for you, what doesn't work for you, what you need and what's important to you? Do you claim to have the mental capacity to handle the complexity of that at a whim, concluding that cleaning your room would be a waste of time? If so, that's quite impressive, that's a lot of calculations you're doing in a very complex world.  
But you see, I don't believe you can do that. I believe you are making excuses and rationalizations. I don't mean this condescendingly, as you're extremely rational in your reasoning, I'm sure. But how do you explain the feeling of ease and relief you get when your room is cleaned? Can you control that feeling, can you expect it? I believe this is a chicken and the egg question, I believe that you start out being to lazy to clean your room and then come up with a bunch of reasons not to do it. Why do you eat junk food? Rationally speaking it would be a bad idea to abstain. Same with drugs, why do you take them? Rationally speaking it's a bad idea.  
You're not logical at all. Before you even start rationalizing reasons for doing something or not, your subconscious has already made its mind up about it. Your subconscious is much faster than your conscious mind.  
So I say, let go of your arrogant presumption that you understand the world, that you can control yourself, that you can make all the right decisions. Show some humility to your unconscious and emotions. You may find something that improves your mental well being that you had previously dismissed through logic, but you need to have an open mind and you need to be humble to the possibilities of the world first.  
What are you getting by trying to convince yourself that you can explain everything, that you have all the answers? Are you scared? Are you scared of not having all the answers? Do you fear going into a deep hopelessness if you let go of control of your world?  
Well I have some news for you, you do not control the world, you don't understand it very much at all so I suggest you bow to the grandeur of it, that you pray to gain the knowledge you need to live properly. If you can let go if this need to know everything, to control everything then you can finally start learning, then you can finally find out what's good for you.  
So, take a bow to the complexity of the universe and clean your room. Your sense of ease and relief will surprise you.",07Dec2019,1

She had a rough childhood and teenage years as well, in fact probably 10x more difficult and damaging than my own so she is going through her own stuff right now as well. I am just connecting the dots on how each or our childhoods have affected who we are now and how it has all boiled over into how we treat each other, how we unhealthily depend(ed) on each other and other people. 

I am feeling very guilty for even having kids. I cannot even take care of myself. I have gotten so angry at them and screamed, even sometimes spanked my son because I cannot even regulate my own emotions and get so angry when he doesn't listen. I feel like a monster and these brilliant, innocent, children deserve order and structure and love and I am failing them. 

The progress I've been making is good, but it feels like a double edged sword. It's like I'm opening myself up to something terrible as well. I've been experiencing a lot of active suicide ideation and the more I think about it the more easy it seems to carry out. I feel like I am walking on thin ice because the idea feels like it's becoming more and more normal in my head and I am just getting closer and closer to the edge every time I have a bad moment. I would regard that as the ultimate failure to my kids and I think that's what is holding me back from letting myself go farther with those thoughts. 

I'm just scared and alone and have taken on more responsibility than I should have. At this very moment, I think I can get past this but I don't know how. What do I do?",07Dec2019,1

Apologies, I rarely post and don’t really know how to format this, I’ve just included information I feel may be relevant. 
I had a minor tiff with someone today, this lasted about 10 minutes and was sorted out amicably. 
However I can’t shake the feeling of anxiety about it, I’m thinking through every interaction I’ve had today, have I said something wrong? What are others thinking about me now? They’re talking about me badly behind my back. They’re going to confront me and tell me something I did wrong Etc.
I see a psychologist, psychiatrist and my GP on a regular basis but I still haven’t learned how to cope in this scenario, my first reaction is to cry uncontrollably and then: Think of/try to kill myself or self harm

119,"Hi everyone.

This is my first post in this sub. I'd just like your opinion or even non-professional advice on an odd issue I'm dealing with. This has been happening for around two months now. 

My brain is trying to remember something. It's not like I intend to remember something myself. It just happens randomly a few times a week, sometimes even a few times a day.

As I said, my brain is trying to remember something. I have no idea what the heck it is. Random words and images do come to my mind when it happens but I can't figure it out. The problem is that when it happens, I start feeling a sense of dread and feel like as if I'm about to have a panic attack. It lasts around 15 seconds.

I realised it's an issue when I was with a friend a few weeks ago. We were just sitting in the car chatting and as soon as it happened I blacked out and then panicked. For around 15 seconds I felt like my brain was only focused on that and got really worried after it ended.

Have you guys ever experienced anything similar or do you have any idea what it might be? It's really weird since not only it has never happened to me before but also cause the people I've told it to don't understand it very well because it hasn't ever happened to them either. What's the problem?

Thanks in advance :)",07Dec2019,1

I couldn't get professionally diagnosed until I was 18 because my parents were kind of in denial.

I have medically diagnosed anxiety, depression, ADHD, and OCD tendencies. 
I also have self-diagnosed autism and dermatillomania (solely because bringing something up to my psychiatrist is hard for me. It took me 2 years to bring up my ADHD).

I have been on 2 SNRI, 3 or 4 SSRI, and 2 ADHD meds in the past 2.5 years.

My current meds were the best because I find I hardly feel positive effects of meds, just the side effects. But with my IBS, it's like I take a laxative every morning.

Now, I've been in a very deep and intense depressive state for the past week and a half and I wont be able to see my psychiatrist until January 13th and I am so frustrated of meds not working and feeling awful.
I have 4 final exams this week and a paper and I haven't been able to study/prep for the exams or even start my paper. 

I feel very run down and working on not feeling like I failed myself (taking to people in r/depression has been helping) but I want to know what you think I should do med wise?

When I took public speaking in college, I remember reading in the textbook that when many people get nervous during a presentation, they worry that other people can tell. The book said that nervousness is not really noticeable.

These things are not true in my experience. Many people in my life have asked me during times when I was nervous, ""Why do you look so nervous? Why do you look uncomfortable?""

These people can clearly tell that I am nervous. If anxiety isn't noticeable then why are people asking me why I look nervous?",07Dec2019,1

However, recently i have been having really unhealthy thoughts when my mother or younger brother leave the house. Other than the general worry for my family this has not been a massive thing for me to be so greatly other than recently. Peices of it have to do with coming to some revaltions about how much my mother inpeticular. How much she has done for me and my brother and how hard she has worked on her own to feed us. Multiple times she has told me the only reason she keeps going is for my brother and and i.  She has severe bipolar with schizophrenic tendancies which means this has especially been a beat down on her. Ive now actually noticed my mothers bipolar now that ive gotten a little older, and i'm more aware of psychological disoreders, giving ive been labled wth a few of my own now. Enough with the sappy stuff about much i love and appreciate my mother. Ive (when she goes to leave) been way more attentive for a moment, as in giving her a hug everytime she leaves, and making sure ""i love you mama"" are the last words i speak to her (same with my brother, and i never ever used to hug my brother). This is because im petrified of of them dying. Its so strange because this that never plagued me until now. I find myself getting extremely sad if i just even think about my mom, because i know she will die at some point, and just shit man idk fucking cars are dangerous and the city she works in is dangerous, i always do not think my mom will live a full life and die of old age. Horribly poisonous and pesimistic thought i know, but thats my problem this does hurt me a lot to think about and i thnk about it a lot. Definitly more than i ever have or am supposed to. Especially since ive known and accepted the concept of death and the inevitabilty of it for a long time. Even that it was going to happen to the ones i loved. Just the last to weeks it seems im really making it mandortory to do these thing to the people i love before the leave our home that we've all lived in for our whole life. Like i said i think a some of it is from becoming more aware of how much trouble she really has gone through working very hard to support me, how much she has exhuasted herself and beat herself down just for my little brother and I, not herself, never herself. I think a peice of it is also myself being under ""stress"" recently. Im always horrifyingly anxious and paranoid so thats nothing new, but rather my mental conditions taking a turn for the worse. All the symptons of my mental health problems have become largely more intense and in the way of my life. So i feel like subconsciously i know that if i where to expeirence a tramatic event it would be the last straw for my mental state, sending me completly mad. I really feel like something like that would be the end my my comprehensive mind, and my abilty to be a citizen or a even kind of normal person. Which i feel like is pretty much the same as death, just preptually more terrorfying.

Although my mental health is a different story, I have many diagnosis, main ones are clinical depression, generalized anxiety disorder, PTSD, depersonalization-derealization disorder and panic attacks.

These ""episodes"" happen out of nowhere, and it seems like without any kind of trigger, it happens when I'm happy, it happens when I'm stressed, basically any time. It usually last for about 1-3 minutes and during this time all I can do is sit and look at whatever is right in front of me, I cannot move, and I cannot think, I have no idea where I am for that moment and its like time is frozen. It's a very scary feeling as if something just took over my body.

When I say things change colors they really do, sometimes it looks like things move or sway gently even though their not. I can't feel, smell, taste or hear anything. I can't even feel my own heartbeat. If someone shakes me, or makes a loud noise during an episode I'll come back to reality but if not i have to wait for my body to come back which takes about 1 min. 

I've been told by my previous therapist that my mental health could have effects on my physical health and i think this might be one of them. These episodes happen quite often about once a week.

I was recently admitted to a mental health facility for a whole flurry of reasons, and met actually some wonderful people there. One of them, let's call him Alex, was an extremely smart individual that had a delusion that he needed to save the world, and was just lowered to my level of care for inpatient (he was in a more closely monitored section, assuming becuase he was classified as a danger) Alex was a very well spoken person, but did not have much of a filter. An example of this was we were doing group therapy and we were doing a questionnaire type thing like what do you want to improve, what do you want to do again, etc and we would talk about our answers. Alex put I want to have sex again as one of the answers and when the therapist told him to keep it go he just simply stated that it was pg. Alex also would wander the hallways for hours, and look emotionless while doing it. He really didn't talk about his issues all too much, which I totally understand, and I wasn't going to push him to tell me becuase that obviously isn't right. As the time went on me and him got closer and he seemed to be getting better, he no longer believed his delusion, but thought if it as the world is not worth saving. On my discharge day I was talking to Alex and we got in the subject of college, apparently he has a PhD in chemistry(I'm a physics major so no wonder we got along) and went to the same college at me so we talked about our favorite professors and how hes doing much much better.

I've had a big amount of stress situations recently. Two weeks ago (when this whole thing started) I had a day when I couldn't concentrate on anything, I couldn't say anything, even reading was problematic.

If I leave them at kindergarden I am afraid someone may kidnap them, I feel deep anxiety when I leave them with someone else even with my husband or parents, I feel anxiety when they are not around me, in last few weeks it got even worse because I am afraid that when they go to sleep they will not wake up so I spend nights going to their rooms and watching if they are breathing.

Got more applications in but have heard nothing back yet. Living with my parents who are supporting me and feeding me - and yes, I know I'm lucky in this respect. But I just feel **so depressed.** I have no money with which to enjoy myself (and I'm not asking my parents because they have helped me enough already). I have no energy to do anything any more - total inertia. Just getting out of bed and having a shower feels like an achievement, frankly. It's so fucking dull and meaningless. I'm just existing, not living. 

I feel like my life is utterly pointless. People keep saying it'll get better - but the truth is, it's very easy for them to give me these platitudes, but nobody actually knows what will happen. There is simply no sign of a job on the horizon for me. It could be another several months. I told friends about all of my feelings but no longer want to burden them with all my crap - so decided to write on Reddit instead. 

I'm seeing a counsellor once a week for one hour - this is really good - but the happiness I feel during the session quickly fades away once I leave the premises and have to face reality once again. I volunteer for a charity as well, but again, this is only once or twice a week. I love the voluntary work but it isn't enough. I still have to go home to my lonely bedroom where I inevitably end up staring at the walls and browsing the internet aimlessly for hours. I don't have many friends nearby - the one or two people I do have are understandably busy and have their own lives, jobs etc. 

The main issues are - lack of motivation to do anything, emotional iisolation and a constant sense of worthlessness. I've ***tried*** all the usual stuff - go for a walk, go for a run, counselling, talk to a friend, have a cup of tea etc etc. These are all **short term solutions**. Ultimately, this won't get much better unless I get a job. I don't know how to cope with my lack of everyday purpose.

I'm a 15 y/o f 
My dad is a narcist (I don't know if he's diagnosed but my mom always told me that he was a narcist (they are divorced))

I've always been a problem child until I hit puberty. I almost got expelled when I was around 4/5 years old (that's what my mom told me) 

I once asked her about how I was as a kid and tbh what she told me kinda made me interested, She said 'when you were a little girl I picked you up from school and told you that we needed to hurry up because I left the oven on and I  didn't want something to happen to your father and you, And you replied with 'I don't care if something happens to my dad. If my brother wasn't there I would go slower''

I guess that u hated my dad or something but idk because my mom told me about that and I don't have any memories.

My mom called me a narcist everytime I did something unacceptable so I decides to do research about narcissism. And tried to compare the symptoms with my personality and I found a lot of interesting things. 
For example:

I've never felt love.
1. I thought that I wasn't attracted to boys and girls and that I just didn't like my family.

2. I rarely feel empathy.
I sometimes do but it doesn't last long, just 1 or 2 seconds and it goes away.

3. I can't be friends with people for long.
I can be friends with them for 1 or 2 year maximum. But it's not that I talk to them a lot it's just I talk to them once a week or something and before I know it I know them for 2 years. But I know that I wouldn't miss them or something.

4. I've never missed someone. 
I thought that u did but I'm not sure anymore.

I sometimes forget that a person I'm close to me exist.


There are a lot of other things that aren't normal (I just realized it lol) but I don't want to make this post that long. so if you want to know some extra details feel free to ask. :)

and like past that I genuinely don't have any dreams

I just wish I had the slightest clue what to actually do with this information

maybe nothing

when it gets right down to it I suppose I just ought to get out

maybe I live long enough to die of ailments that are neither directly nor indirectly caused by my mental health

im glad others have so many goals

and im glad to know people who live their goals

I just know that in my present state I can only hold people back

so maybe I should step back and disappear

just give people the space they need to live their best lives

and if I ever figure out what that means to me

maybe i'll come back

cause even now

im so lonely

i dunno really how others do it

My weight also obviously is bad for my mental health, so it’s just like my mental health and weight problems feed off of each other and keep spiraling out of control.

I never self diagnosed since I kinda got used to having mood swings all the time and it didn’t really cause major issues in my life. But recently I had a long talk with a good friend of mine where we discussed mental health and for the past three weeks I have been thinking a lot about my past and I’m starting to see all of the things I brushed off as just “growing up” and stuff like that. Mostly self harming which happened during a mood swing but it never got past scratches on my arms or picking at my lips. Only twice it went as far as cutting but the cuts weren’t deep. 
The friend pointed out that I might be a bit obsessed with my hygiene. I never really thought about this in an obsessive way but the more I think about it and the more I research it the more concerning it gets. For the past 4 years I have been flossing my teeth and cleaning my ears with a qtip everyday. Two or three times a day actually.  Always starting on the right side, always using 2 qtips for each ear and 20 cm of floss for my teeth. I never really think about it when I’m doing it but if I skip cleaning my ears and flossing my teeth I start panicking and I can’t fall asleeep or anything. 
It’s worse then it sounds because I get ear inflammations pretty much every month, my ear canal is extremely dry and the skin in it cracks in the winter. And my gums keep bleeding everytime I brush or floss. I came to the conclusion that this isn’t normal. 
Does anybody have any idea what to do because my parents don’t want to listen?",07Dec2019,1
160,"This will probably be all over the place, I apologize in advance. If anyone reads through and has any advice I would really appreciate it.

I know a lot of the answers here will be stop drinking, and that’s obviously step one but I can’t help but feel that there is something causing these lash outs and I would like to figure it out. When I get too drunk I occasionally lash out at my husband. I don’t want to listen to what he has to say and am generally mean. His sense of humour is a little on the meaner side and I can be... delicate I guess. I think I learned to combat his meaner sense of humour by being “sassy” back, instead of taking offence. But I don’t know if I’m really not taking offence, and maybe just trying to offend him back. 

I’d like to say here that we’ve been together for 6 years, and our relationship started out very rocky, but has consistently improved. I love him and he’s helped me through so much. My physically abusive ex, my father passing away, sexual assault from a stranger, medical issues and so much more. We both know we can and want to work through this. 

I feel like I must resent him for something though. I only lash out at him and not my other friends when I get too drunk. And that honestly breaks my heart. He may have a mean sense of humour and be a little blunt with his criticism, but he is really very loving and hugely supportive and doesn’t deserve to be lashed out at like this.

I have a pretty extensive history of being physically, sexually and emotionally abused. I also have an extensive history of substance abuse, but I’ve brought that down significantly. I no longer use hard drugs (thanks to my husband) and I don’t drink nearly as often as I used to. But when I do drink now, I tend to go way overboard. 

Am I lashing out because of past abuse? Or because I resent his meaner sense of humour? Am I repressing my anger and it all comes out when I’m drunk? How can I work on this? I could really use some help.",07Dec2019,1
161,"So I am 17M Gay and I probably have a lot of mental health issues, ranging from anger issues to depression. I was always afraid of taking the first step, which probably would have either been signing up for a therapy introduction session OR telling my parents that I'm not well. I was scared, anxious, afraid. I didn't want to take this step even though I always knew that I wasn't going to get better if I do.

TL:DR at the end if you're lazy to read this, it's going to be long.

&amp;#x200B;

 I am from a pretty homophobic country (as I found out recently) and I just recently started accepting myself as a Gay person. The Internalized homophobia is still here and it probably wont go away for a while. So coming out is really scary, my parents haven't really shown any signs to be homophobic, neither has my family, and I understand that coming out is not something you certainly have to do, so I'm not really worried about it that much. I moved to germany around 5 years ago (when I was 11/12) and Germany is a lot better when it comes to acceptance. A lot of my probable mental health issues link to the fact that I'm gay and have internalized homophobia. 

I know self diagnosing isnt really helping but these are a few issues that I might have, I'm not sure, I'm not a therapist, but doing some research led me to these few answers

Social Anxiety

(possibly) depression (not sure about this one but its very possible)

Sleeping and eating disorders (Its very irregular for me)

PTSD (probably very unlikely but there was something that could have caused it) 

Anger management issues/Anger issues overall (Its quite obvious i have this, it runs in my family.)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not going to go into detail here on each one and why I believe I have these, but if you care, you can message me and I'll try to explain it.

There are many things that keep me from seeking therapy, I don't know the language that well, so chances are i wont be able to answer 50% of the questions or explain things that are on my mind. 

I don't know if I can openly speak to a stranger face to face, its a scary thing telling a stranger about all your issues, and I am very self consious and ashamed.

Im afraid that even if i do speak, and i am able to express myself, that the therapist wont understand me or and will judge me (I know this is unlikely and their job is to listen and understand you but im still afraid)

And even if no issues above occur im still worried that the therapist would somehow try to or would contact my parents or anything related.

And lastly, If i seeked help via therapy, i would definitely want an lgbt friendly therapist, and i know its very unlikely that a therapist wouldnt be lgbt friendly, but its still a possiblity which makes me afraid.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR, Suffering from mental health issues and im too afraid to seek help via means of therapy.

No this isn't a post about someone about to commit suicide its just me venting. I don't want to die nor am I actively suicidal.

They couldn't give less of a fuck if they tried. I write this all down in a diary but nobody reads it except me so I'm venting here.

163,"I've been diagnosed with depression for three years, and anxiety for eleven years. My dad is very supportive of me, and my battles with anxiety and depression, he never makes me feel bad about having issues with my mental health. But, I feel guilty because of his mom. 

She isn't alive, she died, she committed suicide in 1999. She had extreme bipolar disorder, she was also an alcoholic, and didn't seek treatment because of all the stigma back than. My dad had to leave high school when he was 16 years old to get a job, and take care of her. She would be super manic, and come to his school, threatening the teachers because one of them gave my dad detention. Other times, she'd be super depressed, and drink for hours. Most of the times during the manic episodes, she'd tried to commit suicide. One time, my dad hid all the knives in his work truck so she wouldn't hurt herself, so she punched the windows, and got the glass shards to cut herself. 

Every month my dad would have to stop his mom from committing suicide. She was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1998, and in 1999, when my dad came home from work to see her, there were ambulances all over the place, she overdosed on painkillers the hospital gave her. She committed suicide. My dad still says to this day, "" I should have never gone to work that day!"". 

What makes this worse, is that my dad always says, "" You look just like my mother. You sound just like her. You talk just like her."". He told my mom he's afraid I'm gonna act like her, and try to commit suicide, and hurt myself. I've never been suicidal, but I understand why he'd be scared.

168,"Right. Long shot. Not sure if this is the right thing to do, but I’m out of obvious options. Throwaway because friends who reddit and therefore a small risk that the detail in this post combined with my profile could be identifying.

Also, sorry for the long post.

My very good friend is having a rough time. He is usually the soul of the party. He’s smart, gregarious kind and motivated. However, he’s always suffered from anxiety, struggles a bit financially and has a stressful home life (loving, but small house, kids, pets etc). He’s the main bread winner, but has recently lost his job. This has triggered his anxiety and he’s spiralled quite a bit to the point where it seems he’s crossed the line from anxiety to depression (I realise these are two different things) and he is struggling to get out of bed. He’s lined up a minimum wage job, but that isn’t going to cut it long term.

Our relationship is strong, we’re good mates, but our primary form of socialising is to have a few beers and chat shit. Sometimes quite a few beers. Once I found out that he was struggling, I tried to arrange some non-beer related socialising (hiking, walking the dogs, non-boozy gaming etc). However, he didn’t really respond. When he did, it was clear he wanted to get out and have a few beers. Because I was primarily concerned that he got out of the house, I agreed.

I’ve just got back from being out with him. From the moment I met him it was pretty obvious he was medicated (He wasn’t previously, I was aware that he had been to the doctors but not what/if he was prescribed). We had four beers over three hours and he was not himself, before or after. Usually he could sink eight and be up at 6am the next day. He was slow, forgetful and subdued.

I kept it cheerful and briefly and cheerfully slipped into the conversation the idea of doing some exercise together (kept it focussed on me, I’ve gained some weight recently and could do with an exercise buddy to motivate me regardless). He was open to it, but I doubt he’ll even remember we had the conversation tomorrow. Even if he did, I don’t know that he’d follow through and regardless, I know exercise is not some magic bullet anyway.

His family has history with drink and mental health issues, his father died young, booze related.

I’m worried for him. I’m not stupid and not used to being lost as to the best course of action in any given scenario, but I’m not sure what I can do to help. I’ve considered talking to his wife and talking to him directly, but I don’t want to come across patronising (he’s 10 years older than me and my family situation is different to his) or as if I’m sticking my nose in.

I appreciate any helpful comments, but I’m not after platitudes or comments such as ‘be there for him’. For a starter, I’m not sure what ‘being there’ even means in a practical sense.

What can I do to help my friend? I’m lost.

Overthinking helped me create an imagination, I created fictional movies and stories in my head all my life, I slept good many nights as a little kid for envisioning my room full of miniature soldiers and starships, there to protect me from the powers of darkness. As a kid my only goal was the biblical ""absolute knowledge"", and now I know why. Now going to sleep takes a long time, as being more mature I know those imagination creations won't help me, and the slightest creek in an old wardrobe will keep me up for minutes awhole. My imagination now only travels to the future, immediate or not, and though it may sound stupid, one thought can completely take my whole mind over. It pops in my head and then OCD strikes and I start creating plans and thinking them through a hundred times and I check my house, my doors, my wardrobes, I check online anything I need in case something ""like that"" would happen. The last thing, either I have someone else inside of me truly, or my brain is multifunctional, because there are moments when things come to my mind without even thinking about them, especially jokes. It's totally strange to create a joke involuntarily, laugh it off then say it to your friends, because you heard it from inside your head.

After this whole possible non-sense, what do you think I should do? To be noted, only my friends know, and not even a quarter of what I said above. My biggest fear is to be locked in a mental issues institution, and I can't overcome this fear, I tried. Rather than those above, I attend 2 universities, I work during the summer, I have a normal student life, again with the exceptions said above.

Thank you for your time and I am sorry in advance, all the best to you kind strangers! Happy holidays and a happy, prosperous and healthy year!",07Dec2019,1
