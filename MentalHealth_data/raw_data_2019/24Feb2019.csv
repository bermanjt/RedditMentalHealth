0,"   My girlfriend is beautiful. I’m not just saying that. She’s actually unbiasedly an attractive human being. She’s also borderline underweight but has a good figure. I’ve always been very supportive towards her body image. Genuinely i think she’s amazing looking and i show and tell her that a lot. But even she told me that there is nothing i can do to make her feel likes she skinny and pretty. From reading online, it really seems like she needs to see a therapist but she refuses. I’ve hinted at it very supportively but she will not. The issue has started to get in the way of our relationship at some points. She won’t wear certain clothes some times, she won’t let me touch her stomach a lot too. She alternates from feeling good to bad about her self and I can’t do much to change this. I’m not sure what to do at this point, i feel so powerless and frustrated. I want to help her but I don’t even know what to do anymore. She is so clearly not fat or ugly at all and it’s so sad to see her like this. ",24Feb2019,3

If I can’t even find refuge in mental health facilities, how am I supposed to survive living with multiple mental illnesses in general? 

I went to an alternative facility instead of inpatient mental health (psych ward) and I had to leave this place because my anxiety and ptsd were too overwhelming. How does that make any sense? I get my triggers, but if the one place you’re supposed to go to get better doesn’t
 help, is there really any hope? 

Does ptsd ever go away? Or do you just adapt to the “new way “of life? 
I’ve been diagnosed ptsd bipolar + for years now. Active in therapy, take medication, and so on.  I’ve done every thing there is to do to help improve mental health, yet the grip of these illnesses on my brain,  &amp; my over all life are so tight, I can barely breathe. I feel defeated. 

While I’ve dealt with suicidal thoughts in the past, this is entirely different. The way I’ve been living is absolutely not a life I want to continue. I can’t picture a life for the next 50 years if this is how it’ll be. 

I want to know what it’s like to be normal. To not be so controlled by a 3lb mass of synapses and chemical imbalances. When I hear of people who suffer from ptsd die by suicide, I understand why.

2,"After battling anxiety and constant worrying I decided to reach out and see a counselor before it becomes a bigger issue than it already is. I’ve signed my HIPAA paperwork 2 days ago and I’m waiting on my therapist to get back to me to schedule our first session, probably some time this next week. We’ll be doing teleconference sessions. 

I am dealing with a messy roommate that may or may not be moving out in several months. The not knowing whether or not I’ll have to find another person to sign a lease with me is killing me inside, despite trying to suppress the anxiety. On top of it all, I walked into an extremely messy house today and I got into a text confrontation with my roommate over it.

I can’t wait to start therapy so I can put my mind at ease and stop ruminating over everything negative. ",24Feb2019,1
3,"Before I start because I think it matters, here are my current diagnoses: Schizoaffective- Bipolar type, OCD, general anxiety. These diagnoses could already have an influence on what i'm about to discuss, so I found it important to point those out. 

I have a chronic tendency to see the darkest part of everything in an obsessive way. I would definitely say that it has to do with the O of OCD, honestly. I'm just wondering if there could be any chance this specific realm of thought has a title. If it does, I could look into it and learn how to cope.

Anyway, I seem to obsessively focus on really horrible sides of everything and lately the few things that gave me light are... crumbling and becoming as dark, if not darker, than everything else. It's breaking my heart. I'm smothering hope and purity with the knowledge that it is only a thin veil over horror and the disturbing. I feel like I carry the weight of the suffering world on my shoulders, and I cannot be happy without that weight getting heavier. They're horribly obsessive thoughts of death, disease, loss of purity &amp; happiness, disturbing things, horribly sad things. It never stops. I feel like it is my autopilot to the extent that every single thought I have is tainted by some sort of darkness. I feel like i'm living in a Stephen King novel; all of the uncomfortable subjects that come through in his books are my waking life. It is exhausting. I cant just ride in the car with someone I love and enjoy the moment. My mind has to conjure up all these horrifically sad things and insights that most people do not dwell upon very long at all. 

I'm not the type of person to sit in the back of a high school classroom reading HP Lovecraft and saying, ""If you dont suffer and realize how dark reality is, you're retarded."" I want more than anything to experience untainted joy.( It is why I love children so much and want to have a child of my own. Even if it's for just a few years, they're untainted. They're pure, happy, adorable, and they have so much love. I think that is a reason parents love their children so. They are a light of hope in a world with none. Delusional as that might be.)

I cant think of anything that is unstained by bad thoughts. Nothing in my life is unstained with one of my series of obsessive thoughts. Whether it be loving on my dog only to obsess over her death, playing with a little cousin only to acknowledge his vulnerability that could stain him forever if not handled, or trying to speak to my senile grandfather but only being able to carry the weight of his suffering. My grandparents were one of those few things that brought me unrequited light. The stains my mind put on them were insignificant beneath their rays of love. Now, god, that is the most stained part of my life. My grandfather- I hate to admit it- is becoming my obsessive thoughts incarnate when before he was a ray of sun. Lewy body dementia and PTSD. He says these wildly dark things that blow my mind. They're like hes saying the intrusive thoughts I cant get rid of, but they're coming from my ray of light. It has put the hugest damper on my obsessions like no one can believe. What he says sometimes can be horrific, and it's really like all my dark thoughts are coming from the mouth that used to (still sometimes does) bring me pure love and happiness. 

I suppose being upset by things like this is totally normal but *not to my extent.* It is all I fucking think about, man. I mean *all* I think about. I cannot stress that enough. It's not like I get depressed for weeks and then finally come out of it. It's not like I get sad then can go do something to help it. It's not like I think and worry at times and just let it fester in the background. It is *always there* always with me. These obsessive thoughts that totally stain all happiness.

I'm so obsessive I am following the career path to be a funeral director. I spend my free time writing horror and tragedies. All I can read and enjoy are horror, tragedies, and sad poetry. My paintings are dark, too. I hobby with taxidermy, bone collection, and in general art made from death, and it is... the only fucking thing that makes it stop. Working with death is the most therapeutic thing for me. It is exposure to some form of darkness, taking control of it, and living physically with it. It's part of my intrusive thoughts but instead i'm choosing to exist with it and even have artistic intimacy with it. But still, all my existence feels dark. I say dark not like a batman character who wants to look cool. I seriously think ""darkness"" is the worst fucking feeling on the planet that totally trumps anything else. I cant find any other word for it, really, other than the made up word ""Disturbia"" which I use to define the state of living in darkness.
It's my existence and I seem to live in it alone.

No matter the happy environment around me, there is something fucked up about it. I have been like this my whole life only for it to get worse. I value and love my life, especially my family. Amazingly supportive, open minded, and so fucking loving. Sometimes I cry because how much I love them. So nothing has caused this, but it is how I have always existed.

Ever since young childhood, I have been really aware of morality, vulnerability, and suffering. My dad has a severe seizure disorder that I grew up with. I would *never* tell him this but one of my earliest memories is asking my mom why my dad sometimes makes noises. She explained of course. But I saw my father, who as a child is supposed to be your god. ""Mother is god to the eyes of children"" and so is father. My god lost 15 years of his life from falling down. And I grew up watching him in these vulnerable states of no control. I dont know if you've ever seen someone have a bad seizure, but it is horribly disturbing especially for a child when it is there dad. It stuck with me. Something about that experience exposed me to vulnerability and mortality way too young. When I was 8, he had a grand-mal seizure, and I was the one who called the ambulance. That night at the hospital I cried and felt so much emotion for him that it was beyond my comprehension. The sounds of him in the emergency room were traumatic and I remember going into a room with all my family where my uncle lead a prayer. For some reason at that moment, I stopped feeling for a long time. The weight was too much. I was an apathetic depressed preteen until I was hospitalized at 14 where during my stay, my guard of apathy *shattered.* In a group therapy session, these other girls were sharing traumas and emotions. When they got to me, I looked at the counselor, tried to speak, and all that came out was crying that couldnt stop. I was crying for them and everyone in the world. Since then the heavy empathy of my childhood came rushing back no matter how hard I told it to fuck off. 


Unless I feel nothing, I am feeling everything. And the worst of it is that it is all tainted in darkness whether it be in small levels or huge levels. My brain finds some sort of sadness to throw onto happiness. Hell, I just remembered: When I was a little kid, my grandma would say goodbye like ""See you later alligator"" and I would reply ""After while crocodile."" This is probably the more adolescent version of my intrusive thoughts of dying and suffering, but, I stopped saying goodbye like that because... one day I imagined us saying that to each other on her deathbed before she died. I was at least 8 or 9. And I was thinking like that. A happy communication between me and someone I love became about watching them die.

It never stops. It's so fucking chronic there has to be other people who experience this and there has to be a title for it.",24Feb2019,1
4,"my best friend of six years has been battling depression these past couple months but has seemed to have gotten worse recently. she called me and told me she planned on killing her self but decided against it. i was happy she called me and felt relieved when she said she didn’t want to die. i’m still nervous about her because i couldn’t imagine life without her, considering she’s my best friend in the world.

i struggle with anxiety so we can always relate about medications and therapists 

i’m nervous it’s gonna get worse and i want to be there for her as a friend. i don’t want to overstep my boundaries or seem annoying, but i want to encourage her to get better and help her. i know i can’t help her fully, since it’s her own battle she’s fighting, but i want to make sure she’s alright

5,"Now, I know what one might read so please please follow along. I've attempted suicide twice myself and suffer long lasting health problems from both attempts and neither fixed my PTSD, and the emotional pain I suffer every day. But the thought occured to me... 

Why does everyone blame the suicidal person for their suffering and agony, instead of the people or society who made them that way? Why is it selfish to see you are a burden on others, that your relationships are a desperate grasp on meaning to keep you from ending your life and see that's a toxic relationship, to know you aren't entitled to help from your suffering?

The reality a lot of suicidal family/friends I've known and lost, that they have to deal with is that in the end you are on your own. Society says ""if you want help you have to pay for it yourself.  If you can't magic up money though sh*t. The world owes you nothing.""

Yet when someone commits suicide everyone who knows them calls it selfish and act all entitled to their life after beating into the suicidal person that it's every man for himself? I feel it's extremely hypocritical to tell a suicidal person they are entitled to nothing and it's selfish to expect anyone to live for them only, but cry at their death or attempts as if you are entitled to them and they should live just for them. ""I won't live for you by helping you, but you have to live for me!""

I understand how it is to be suicidal, even now.  Anyone I've lost to suicide I've never resented.  They took the means to end their own suffering and I don't blame them.  And suicide is literally the hardest thing to try doing, because it is against human nature. Which is to stay alive no matter what.

Last point, I get a lot. ""There are therapy programs and help, you have no excuse to not get better!""... Society has unrealistic expectations of what can and can't be achieved and what is and isn't available till they are the ones clawing for a scrap of help. Mental health care right now is like the sinking titanic. There aren't enough life boats for everyone and life jackets are only good for so long in the freezing darkness. Besides that those with no money or family are often unable to even fight for this hyperbolic life boat like the poorer classes on the titanic resigned to death in the lower quarters. People are going to die until enough resources are made and precautions are put in place to prevent these hyperbolic ships from sinking in the first place. It's life,  life is messy and people who are poor and sick don't magically get help like neglected fairytail princesses.",24Feb2019,49

2.  What are the most common types of mental health problems you experience among your students?

3.  Do you have any preferred coping tactics to help keep the students from becoming a distraction to themselves or others?  If so, what are the best coping strategies?

4.  What are some of the products or services that are available to students to help with mental health problems?

5.  What are your thoughts on the effects of technology in relation to childhood mental health?  Do you think technology is good for students, or bad for students?

6.  How impactful do you think the rising obesity rates among today’s youth are in relation to mental health?  

7.  If you could do one thing to have a meaningful impact on mental health in children, what would you do, and why?

12,"I was taking a bath and all was fine, in fact I actually felt un-anxious for the first time in days. But then when I got out (and began thinking again basically) I was standing and taking my hair out of a ponytail and I got really dizzy. Like this was to the point where my vision was going in and out of clarity. I just took a couple sips of water and slowly laid down on the floor since I knew that I could potentially faint and obviously if I’m already lying down I cant fall and hit my head. Anyways after about 10 minutes I got up and high-key struggled down the stairs and basically fell onto the couch, I was that dizzy. But now I’ve been sitting here for probably about 20 minutes and I’m feeling ok.

13,"TW: rape

It was an extremely traumatic experience, physically and mentally. It started out consensual, but quickly turned into something else. I backed out and told him to stop because of the pain and he refused and just said ""it'll be better if I just go faster,"" I ended up with a vaginal tear which was the most excruciating pain I've ever felt.
 
I went through the whole process of ""I don't want to talk about it. It makes me sick to even think about."" For a good while but I finally decided to go to therapy and I'm soon going to be starting EMDR therapy with my therapist which I'm very hopeful about.

Ive never really let myself feel anything before. I've been in a state of denial for so long and have let myself be consumed with anger but last week everything came out like a flood. The trigger of all this seeing him on social media. His profile popped up on tinder and he liked my Instagram photo. Couple this with the fact that on the same day this other guy who I've had to block 5 times somehow was able to text me from a different number, I was just DONE with men. I was so angry and upset I just wanted EVERYONE to leave me alone and it didn't help that I had been with people every day/night so I hadn't had time to let it get to me. 


I was at work  (I work donations at a thrift store). I was visibly upset and didn't want to talk to anyone which is pretty unusual for me when I'm working. My friend kept asking me if I was okay which made me more angry because at the time, I just wanted her to shut up and leave me alone. I appreciated the concern but I've never felt that much anger in my entire life. 

Finally the last time she asked me if I was okay I started crying profusely and shaking. I don't know what came over me but it was a wave of emotion.  She pulled me aside and talked to me and calmed me down a bit but I was still shaking so my boss told me to go sit down for a while and offered to let me leave. 

I went home, drank wine and watched SpongeBob, and went to therapy the next morning. I felt very weird the next day, like I was still kinda shaken up but weirdly calm at the same time. Obviously it's only been a few days since then, but I'm so relieved to have finally let it out.

The ""traits"" I have that worry me is that I do have a desire TO BE SOMETHING in my life. For example I've been working on music the past few years and would love to have it as a career. I would love to hear that many people like my music. Isn't that a sign of wanting admiration?

I've been in a depressed state with diagnosed health anxiety for awhile and recently wanted to better myself. But I'm afraid that the 'bettering' of myself will lead to narcissism as well.

One could say I have “maladaptive daydreaming,” and I think it could be indicative of a mental problem, as mental illness runs in my family.

I know I should stop so I can actually improve myself but a strong part of me doesn’t want to because daydreams give me a taste of what could’ve been, or what I want in life, and they make me feel better when little else does, even though deep down I know they aren’t real, they’re never going to be real, and I’m only doing it to cope with my problems. I also largely don’t want to stop because for some of the negative aspects of my life I’m losing hope that they’re actually fixable, either because it’s out of my control or it’s just the way I am, and daydreaming might be the only place where those negative aspects are gone.

Did nothing for like a year. After that I got a job and quit my job before the year was even up (after I left pretty much everyone who worked there started leaving too, the management was shit and the staff were treated terribly). 

I did nothing for 2-3 years, got a Christmas temp job last Christmas, that ended and the more I think back. I've done absolutely nothing of value and I seem to just give up on everything. It's like I can't find the point to anything, I don't care about it.

As for an update; I've got an appointment in the psychiatric ward of the hospital next month. Hopefully I get some answers to the messed up shit that's been going on in my brain. Maybe they'll hospitalize me for a little while, who knows. It could be interesting I guess?

Ever since I opened up about my mental wellbeing, for me it just feels like I've made it all real and that it's just been getting worse and worse now that I have and keep acknowledging that it exists. I know I'm not alone, but I can't help but feel like I'm all alone with it. That no one can actually help.

Sometimes I don't even think that I'm sick, that I'm perfectly fine and I just see the world for what it is. How it should be. Then there's other times where I'm not sure if the hallucinations were even hallucinations, I'm still not sure if they are or were.

I guess I just don't know how to deal with it. Talking about it just makes me feel worse, ignoring it is probably what got me here in the first place, I don't know what else there is besides medication, and I don't even know if I'll need that. I don't know if I'm even mental ill.

All that aside, in a previous post I said that I was self aware enough to know somethings not right. But I'm starting to think I have no self awareness, that I've just been going insane and trying to find a logical reason for it. I don't know, I'm overthinking everything.",24Feb2019,8

30,"For context: 

I'm under 18 and I've been struggling with intense emotions for as long as I could remember. It was so hard to control all my emotions, especially my negative ones, and it would take a very long time for the emotions to de-escalate to the point where they were somewhat manageable. I always thought I was highly sensitive and I despised it, the smallest things could change my mood or throw me off the hook and barely ever could control it. I would fight, a lot, not physically but verbally, because I couldn't control my emotions and I've lost many friends because of it. I learned to internalize the anger and the feelings of being overwhelmed  by taking it out on myself, (aka self-mutilation). I always thought my MDD (major depressive disorder) coupled with my ADHD caused these vast mood swings. (Especially since people with ADHD are known to have rejection sensitivity.) I have been in therapy for about 3 years now and I just thought I wasn't trying hard enough to make any progress. Then I changed therapists because of insurance, and I went to a DBT specialist who has been doing DBT for over 13 years. 

&amp;#x200B;

 At around a few weeks into therapy, I found an artist that I followed on social media talk about her mental health journey and discovered something called BPD, (Borderline Personality Disorder). When I dig some digging myself and looked into the criteria for BPD, it was like something clicked. Everything that I was going through, started to make sense. My intense mood swings and the fact that it takes forever for the emotions to go away, my feelings of numbness and emptiness, my low self esteem/ my ""broken"" self-image, my constant suicidal ideation, my eating disorder problem, my impulsive actions, my extreme fear of abandonment and the crazy lengths that I'd go to stop abandonment even if it wasn't there. Everything just seemed to apply to me, and it was... scary and yet relieving. 

&amp;#x200B;

I asked my therapist, who I was actually making good progress with, about BPD. She explained it to me and told me that DBT was created to help those with BPD, and that I was showing many of the main symptoms of BPD. My therapist told my to constolt my psychiatrist about this even if though it is uncommon for an adolescent to have BPD, and I did... somewhat. I told my dad about it, and I was too scared to mention it to my psychiatrist, he just makes me very nervous and uncomfortable. My dad voiced my psychologist's concerns and how she thinks I should be screened for BPD, and he looked at me, my dad... and started to laugh. 

He told me that I didn't have it and that I couldn't be diagnosed for it because I'm under 18 since personality disorders are serious and that my mood swings could be caused my hormones/ puberty. (He basically told me that it was just teen angst and needed no further investigation and my dad believed him.) 

I was to put it mildly, *very appalled* by his reaction and felt so much shame I didn't do anything. I'm still struggling with my intense emotions, and I'm planning to get more intense DBT to try and combat this. 

I don't know if I should get a second opinion or not. I wouldn't get one if I were actually screened and I didn't meet the criteria to have BPD, I would be fine with that. The fact that he brushed my psychologist's concerns aside and didn't even bother to do a screening anyway, honestly was insulting. I felt like my feelings were being trivialized as some teen angst when I just want help. So, should I get a second opinion?

Everyone thinks I should know how to control the train. They keep telling me how to slow it down, but their suggestions don't work and then they get mad at me. Some people give up and walk away because they think I ***WANT*** the train to be speeding out of control! I don't; I'm intensely uncomfortable with the unpredictable velocity and I'm constantly terrified that the train is going to derail *and* I'm angry at myself for being unable to control it. Sometimes I wonder if my only option is to jump off the train.

I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. The symptoms I deal with include sudden, extreme mood swings, episodes of severe paranoia, intrusive and obsessive thoughts, deficits in my autobiographical memory that make it difficult to remember events that took place just a couple of days ago, unstable identity, interests, opinions, and beliefs, and extreme difficulty forming healthy and safe relationships. At times I've heard voices, suffered dissociative episodes with amnesia, and dealt with psychosis. All of these things make controlling my behaviour a constant struggle. Sometimes I scream at people or my pets (I know, its horrible, isn't it?), quit my job with no back-up plan, steal things I don't want or need, hurt myself purposefully, spend all my money impulsively, break things I care about, and I've done lots of worse things I can't even bring myself to type out. I regret all of these things and often I didn't even want to be doing them when I was doing them.

Story

So  I am in college and the college has a stressful environment anyways but  I handle that ok. However, I am having roommate issues. He is basically  bullying the way he jokes around and says comments, me being a quiet  type just takes it and doesn't say anything because I don't like hurting  or upsetting people. This has gone on for 6 months my other roommate is  getting upset because the 1st roommate just doesn't care about anything  and we both are tying to help him.  Anyways I have been holding all of  this frustration and hurt and anger inside and today i was texting my  parents about this and just ranting a bit trying to figure out what to  do and I got really heated during this rant, I think I texted for two or  three hours about all of this. which I know it isn't fair to my parents  but I needed someone to talk too.

Symptoms

While  texting describing what was going through my mind I started feeling  flushed in the face, and a tingling/pins and needle sensation in my  neck, face and upper body. When I finished texting I stood up and felt  dizzy and the tingling just spread to the rest of my body not my legs as  much but my arms, hands, chest face. And my face felt super flushed.  Afterwords I just felt tired and exhausted but now a couple of hours  later i feel refreshed I still am frustrated with my roommate but i feel  more focused on my stuff.

I did not attack anybody or hit anyone or do anything violent at all.

If  you guys could help or point me in the direction of somewhere that can  help that would be great. And yes I plan on talking to councilors when  they open. Its just odd because I am usually super quiet and not  aggressive at all so that just took me aback to feel so heated. It is all kind of a blur so that is as much information as i can remember.

39,"I’m a 19 year old gay guy who just started college. I’m pretty sure I hate myself, I don’t really know if that’s the right way to describe how I feel about myself but that’s what makes the most sense to me. I feel constantly apathetic, except for these periods of about 4-5 days where I just feel incredibly sad and quite frankly suicidal that happen about once a month or so. I feel incredibly lonely both romantically and platonically because I have a really hard time connecting with people, so most of my time is spent alone.

I think the thing that bothers me the most is that, since  I can remember, I’ve had this... thing that I talk to. Well, I guess I don’t TALK to it like out loud, it’s not really a hallucination or anything it’s more of a thought process that I don’t recognize as my own and I communicate with it by... thinking at it. Reading this that sounds really silly but I can’t get rid of it, when I ignore it, it just keeps feeding negative thoughts into my brain and I don’t know how to get rid of it. It tells me that when I die, I belong to it... whatever that means. It calls itself Bigby, and I really don’t know what to make of it. I’m cognizant enough to know that Bigby isn’t real, and there’s some way for me to have influence over that particular thought process but I don’t know how atm.

Long story short, I have some problems and I feel like therapy is the best way to deal with them, but as I said in the title, I’m terrified of it. The thought of having to actually tell another human being these things  in person, out loud feels so impossible to me. My university does this thing where they offer up six sessions for free through thier counseling service, and I really want to make an appointment, but every time I go to do that I can’t get the image of the person telling me that it’s all in my head and there’s nothing they can do.

I am officially diagnosed with depression, anxiety with social anxiety and health anxiety, OCD, PTSD(all on the severe end of the spectrum)  I am currently in the process of more diagnosis because my health team thinks theres something else, and I agree. they think that something else is bipolar. Also I am currently on depakote for mood swings and seizures. 

Anyways, I am SO paranoid. almost to the point where I cant do anything and honestly I dont know if its normal or if Im going absolutely mad. I cant even leave my house, I dont trust people or myself

this is hard for me to talk about so please be kind Im in a hard mental space right now.

I keep having what if thoughts uncontrollably all day over EVERYTHING.""what if I get murdered when I leave on a walk?""  ""why are those people looking at me"" ""what if Im crazy"" ""what if I kill my boyfriend"" ""what if I stab someone"" Ill be cooking for my boyfriend and I and get an intrusive thought ""I could poison this"" and then I panic and tell him and cry.

6 months ago I was having violent outbreaks with hallucinations after I got on lexapro, eventually I tried to stab my boyfriend, who I love dearly and I went to jail for the first time, I was so scared for him and myself. I was hitting him, screaming over small things, hitting myself, hallucinating, over eating this was all not like me at all, even my ""normal"" severe mental health issues are all very self destructive, never at anyone but myself. this went on for 3 months and then I almost stabbed him and got taken off the meds. 

ive never been the same since. 

after I got off lexapro it stopped, but to this day I am always wondering ""what if that wasn't because the meds"" ""what if I kill him"" ""what if I black out and kill a stranger"" all sorts of stuff. it keeps me up at night crying and panicking. I am very open and honest with my boyfriend and health team about all of this, but I still feel misunderstood. 

Im starting to also get paranoid about my emotions as of the past few days, now when I have these thoughts Im numb to them, and depressed and its causing them more ""if Im going numb Ill be capable of murder"" etc

I even at times get suicidal because Id rather kill myself than him. I feel like I have no future and no hope. I once was a loving, emotional, kind person, now I am a monster ",24Feb2019,3

45,"Was it my own fault... or was it them?

So, to start, I am a terrible writer. I am not writing to impress, I am writing to ask a question. A question that digs deep for me. I have always been curious why I have been depressed. I feel like I have been depressed for my whole life. In real terms, I am currently 23 and have been depressed since I have been 16. Over the last couple years, depression has become a serious problem for me. Luckily, I found a psychiatrist and a therapist. They have, quite literally, saved my life. Now, I arrive at my question- is my mental health rooted in my past? I have been digging deep with my therapist and have had amazing improvements. Between my therapist and psychiatrist, I can say this is the happiest I have ever been. Anyway.. let’s get back to the story. I have always had these images in my head of my neighbor getting me completely naked (we are both male). He is four years older than me. He used to make me strip down completely naked and, to be honest, I forget exactly what we did next. I just remember he used to play with my penis all the time and make me do semi-sexual things. One day, my mother got home early one day and walked into my room. I could not get my clothes on fast enough, so she caught us. I just remember me, eight years old, denying anything that happened. I did not want my “cool neighbor” to get in trouble. After this, I don’t remember exactly what happened. All I remember is my parents begging to know why I was naked with my neighbor fully clothed. In recent times, we go on vacations at least once a year for the last 10 years. Fast forward to today- something weird happened. I brought up the fact that child exploitation was occurring on YouTube. I don’t have an exact link, but if you guys google it, you will find it (advertisers are pulling out and everything). I told them how fucked up it was. We got on the topic of how people take positions of power to take advantage of kids and I said “they end up ruining these children’s lives forever- they never forget being touched as a child”. My parents got awkwardly quiet, which is something they NEVER do. They did this weird thing where they say they “actually know very well” what happens to children like this. It instantly made me think of when they were thinking of when that caught me. What instantly popped up in my mind is, “I think they are thinking of me..”. The only thing is, I have always thought that it was a thing that occurred between “just us kids”. Am I being stupid and exaggerating what happened to me? This is the worst part about talking to my therapist. The question that haunts my mind at all times, that may connect to you guys as well, is: “Was it them who did something wrong? Or was it my own fault?”.

I have always found music as a source of comfort. When I discovered Spotify, I was thrilled, all the songs I ever could want (for the most part anyway) in one place, but when I looked around for a playlist to help me deal with my mental health issues, searching the keywords 'depression' and 'anxiety' showed me list after list of sad and angry music. Now I know that this is really helpful for some people, but I'm not one of them, so I thought about making a playlist where all of the songs have positive messages. Except every time I started to make the list, I would delete it, my mind would get to me and tell me no one would care, so I stopped trying. 

That is until March of 2015. Supernatural star Jared Padalecki started a campaign called ""Always Keep Fighting"" to raise awareness of mental illness. I ended up joining a Facebook group that was started because of this campaign and quickly made a lot of new friends who became the support system I had always needed in my life. One night I was telling some of them about my playlist idea and how I kept getting in my own way. They encouraged me to make the playlist anyway. So I did. 

I find it very hard to be proud of myself for any reason, somehow I always find a way to make it seem like things were someone else's idea or that it was a group effort (even when it wasn't) but I am proud of this playlist that I have been working on for four years now. Not only does it help me on a daily basis, but I get emails and messages from people thanking me for making it, or suggesting songs that should be added to it. I've seen other lists pop up with songs from mine as a springboard. This keeps me going, it keeps me from shutting down completely because even when I feel like I have nothing left to do, nothing left to give, I can at least look for songs to add to the list.

As of this moment it has 2,082 followers and 979 songs. I don't do it to gain followers, the number makes me feel good, but only because I know I'm helping people out there even when I feel like I can't get out of bed. 

The list also helped me with the confidence to cross off a goal on my bucket list, I ended up getting to meet Jared Padalecki and and ask him what song he would add, and I did it in front of a crowd of a few thousand people. I wasn't scared, I didn't get stage fright, I got my message out and made everyone laugh to boot. Later on he told me I was amazing, and I know I shouldn't need validation to love myself, but hearing him say it in my head and remembering everything in my life that led me to that moment, reminds me that, as a friend of mine recently put it, I have more power than I realize. 

We all have more power and strength inside us than we realize, we use it every day but don't give ourselves credit for it. It takes a tremendous amount of effort and energy to deal with mental illness, but it can be a little easier knowing you're not alone, that you will get through this, that you ARE amazing, and you are loved. 

That is why I made the Always Keep Fighting: Anti-depression playlist, to remind us all of these facts.

And the last one was chill even after frosh week, we hung out but I realized that I wasn’t giving this guy any space so I thought how about I don’t text him and he’ll just ask me to hang out with him. After that we pretty much just stopped talking. I’ve seen him on campus like twice or thrice that’s it. Most of the people here are locals even if they live on res, they live close by and already have friends from before. I was friends with a couple of girls but I found out that they really just don’t include me in their plans at all. There’s a bunch of other people that have blackballed me in a similar fashion. I know what you might have to say. Friendships take effort and time but man whenever I open up to people they just start playing games and we’re back to square one. It’s annoying and frustrating. I don’t do much other than studying and wasting time on the internet. My productivity has fallen on a crazy level. A couple of friends from my high school contact me and they’re like why do you never post pictures out with friends and stuff like that all the other people that have gone away for university are partying everyday. My ego obviously won’t let me admit that I have failed at connecting with people. Even with girls, my confidence has gone from sexting with 4 girls on the bounce in one night to almost no female interaction at all. I’m sick of these dorm room walls. I’m still focused on academics I know that’s what I should be focused on. I used to like hitting the gym a lot so I’m gonna start doing that again. I know it sounds ambitious but I’ll push hard to play varsity soccer next year so I’ll start working on that.  I don’t know I think the social aspect of life is important too and while I’m getting straight As in class I’m getting Ds in my social life. I’m still searching hoping that someone just genuinely likes me for who I am and meets me halfway. I don’t know. Thanks for reading this!

62,"I really don't know how to explain this. I've been trying to type up exactly what is wrong but I can't seem to put what's wrong into words. I suppose the easiest thing would be to explain what has been happening due to whatever is wrong with me. I've been having these awful attacks of emotions as of late. Sometimes it occurs while I'm walking home from school or work, other times it's when I'm driving or on the clock at my job. Randomly I will feel threatened. It's really out of no where. I'll be fine doing whatever I'm doing and then all of a sudden I feel like someone or something wants to hurt me. I then get tunnel vision and really light headed and end up crying uncontrollably as well as hyper ventilating. It's really embarrassing and I have done my best to hide it from everyone I know. The first couple of times these attacks happened I actually began to scream and yell for help, but I have been able to stop that because it only drew more attention to me. Another thing that has been happening is my sleep has been constantly interrupted by really bad dreams. Most of these dreams are of bad things that have happened to me. I have tried my best to get over these things, but when I dream about them they feel so real. The physical pain that happens in my dreams are almost manifested in reality and I really feel them. The words said to me in these dreams hurt just as much as they did when they were first said. I'll often wake up sweating profusely and yelling, and then I'll have to sit awake for a couple of hours reassuring myself that all that stuff happened in the past, not the present. The only escape I feel like I have from these attacks and dreams are when I'm around music (either listening or playing) or spending time with my girlfriend, but since I'm a full time student and employee, I don't have time to do this stuff that often.  I've lost my close friends because I've been really distant towards them, and my girlfriend is really worried about me. I don't know what's going on with me but I want to put a stop to it and get my mind back. I don't really know what the point in posting this is, but it does feel kind of good to put it into words. I guess if you guys have ever experienced something like this, how did you deal with it? What are some good coping mechanisms? What do you think is wrong?  ",24Feb2019,2
63,"I've been googling and trying to find a term for it, but I didn't have much luck and figured I'd ask here. Everything pointed to kids with ADHD or Autism, and I'm in my late 20s so I dunno if it's any different for me at this age.
  
I'm someone who likes to blow out my senses from time to time, be it too loud headphones, too much wasabi on a sushi roll, or shut off all lights except my monitor and do something trippy on it. What got me to ask is that tonight I decided on a whim to hop naked into the snow in my (private)backyard, and while it was freezing, it was kinda settling at the same time. Felt therapeutic almost.

64,"So... the the title is a mouthful but a perspective I want to address. Mental health is currently one of the most unknown of the medical sciences. It’s not for a lack of effort, money or willing laborers. It’s simply a lack of understanding.  Star Trek fans might know the tag line “Space, the final frontier”,  however in reality the human mind presents itself as the unknown. Statistically speaking, 1 in 5 kids between the ages of 13-18 suffer mental impairments. Over 40% of individuals older than 65 are known to suffer. 

So why? How can this be? The truth involves industry. Pharmaceutical companies, medical conglomerates... down to the doctors who provide your care and the lawyers that decide what care they will pay for you to obtain! In all honesty the chemicals we swallow each day to treat our psychosis is nothing more than a crap shoot on the providers part. They know one medicine helped this person so it might help you! Furthermore, the conglomerates understand this and are potentially withholding “sanity saving” medicine to create a profit flow that will earn their shareholders an extra dollar. 

But I digress... this isn’t a political/ideological post! I only want the people to understand that the current psychiatric model is not working. You might even expected as much! 

The goal is to help, to treat and to educate... keep mental health an open source event! Good luck

66,"Currently struggling with bulimia, depression, and anxiety. I'm being medicated for the last two, but I'm struggling heavily with the bulimia. 

Have had two or three binge-free days in the past week and a half, and have been purging for most of them (still gaining weight though because my stomach is bottomless) 

I feel like now that I've gained so much weight (used to be low-end healthy, now high end) and I'm going to therapy I should at least be getting better. But I'm not. I humor my therapist with ""I'm recovering"" mantras but I have nothing to show for it. 

I truly want to get better but I'm controlled by this food addiction and I don't know what to do. How do I tell my support system that I need more help when I'm shot down with stuff like, ""Just keep trying!! I know you can do it!!"" 

I know I can too, but the environment I'm in isn't conducive to my recovery. Easy access to binge food, easy access to places in which I can purge, and a dad who fails to take my binges seriously, saying the only reason I binge is because I'm ""hungry"". 

I feel completely lost. I feel like I should just be able to stop but I lack any semblance of self control.",24Feb2019,2

69,"Hello guys, I am at an awful position in my life again. I have had OCD since I was in 6th grade and I never got help for it because my mom always thought I was exaggerating and making stuff up and my dad was an alcoholic who didn't give a fuck about anyone or anything. I couldn't function properly all throughout middle school thinking I was going to get some horrible disease and I started showering compulsively and getting into rigorous cleaning behaviors to prevent illness. In 8th grade it finally subsided only to have Dysmorphia take it's place. I got acne in 8th grade and suddenly all of my OCD converted to BDD and since then it has only exponentially spiraled downwards. 


I used to be a keen-minded coordinated kid with lots of ambition. All throughout elementary, I was always the smart kid who got his homework turned in on time and I thought I had a future back then in something like science or math. I can't even look at myself in the mirror today without feeling like I'm being tortured and every time I feel my face or see my back I feel like I'm about to break down crying. I feel an itch all throughout my face and back and I also feel like parts of my face are extremely hot (from blushing all day) to the point where whatever area feels hot ends up getting acne. 


 My acne is stress induced, it came from intense skin picking and sweating like crazy all day. I want to wrap this up quick since I know people hate reading walls of text. I am at a crossroads right now. I haven't gotten any zits in a few months because of Accutane but I'm off of it, and now it's coming back because of my fear and anxiety has caused me to go back to sweating and scratching like crazy. I have stopped scratching, and stopped looking in the mirror in hopes of being able to cancel out the anxiety. I still sweat like fucking crazy regardless though. I'm on day 6 of not looking at myself, I'm feeling less-confident than I originally did. Guys, I want my motherfucking life back and I want to be on top of this bitch and I can't with this cunt illness ruining my day every day and it's because I let it. I'm a social person who never got the opportunity to be social because I convinced myself I was too ugly and too deformed for people. I went back to the gym today, and I ate a proper meal for once (I'm really poor). I want to live for myself for once in my life and if any of you guys can relate or have similar experiences or TIPS especially !!!please!!! throw it at me because this really is the end of the road. I like this one girl in my 3rd period at the college I go to but I don't have the nuts to say anything right now because 6 years of dysmorphia really adds up. I've been getting more and more days where I can let go and be myself but only at work, in school, I am the awkwardest animal you could ever come across. My grades aren't good because I turn in things late but recently I've been doing things on time.

I guess what I'm asking for here, in the end, is just some confirmation that what I'm doing is going to help me beat this. I love MMA and I started doing it recently and the more I focus on it and other things in my life  that make me happy and thankful to be alive the less acne I get and the more beautiful life gets for me (the only problem is that I don't have enough money to go to it every day like I wish I could, but twice a week at least is progress from nothing every week).  The only problem is that that's really hard and I don't want to bet it all on something that might just drown me. I've been bleeding inside for so long and my therapist couldn't help me I think mainly because of the severity and specificness of my problems. She asked me to reframe my thoughts for example when I looked in the mirror and I did it initially with my overall facial features but I couldn't reframe that I was still getting acne and it ended up making it worse from the anxiety that came about from that thought. I am still going, but I only have appointments once a month because of her schedule always being full.

How do I exit this negative mindset of fear and looking back at my mistakes only, and how do I become positive and hopeful? I want to be happy and have meaning again. Thank you in advance for reading this terribly pieced together sloppy story and God bless everyone!

71,"I am 19 years old (live in *wonderful* of Texas), I live with my parents who do not have health insurance. I have not seen a doctor since I was required by the state for school when I was 12. 

So I have been struggling with undiagnosed mental problems for a long time. I have had social anxiety since I was a kid and it has only gotten worse through the years, I also had my childhood stutter return which is really affecting my confidence and ability to socially function. I've also been suicidal probably since I was 14, and it's really gotten worse through the years. Based off internet research (so take it with a grain of salt), I think there is a good chance I have Borderline Personality Disorder; I suffer from most of the symptoms like regular self-harming (I cut everyday), unstable self-image and identity (especially when it comes to orientation and gender), dissociation (usually happens when I am talking to someone), I have volatile relationships with my few family members and friends, but at the same time I intensely fear that will leave me or kick me out. And I have intense episode of depression and anxiety that last for variable amounts of time, and of course I always feel empty and always like I should be doing something else. Regardless of what is specifically I could have, I know something is very wrong and I need professional help.

So my question is, honestly what do you do in a situation like this? I've been trying to find very low cost healthcare options, but I haven't found anything that I could possibly afford, especially since these problems are really affecting my ability to land (I really am trying, despite what my parents say). Even then I imagine there's lots of mental things that are not covered regardless on cheap plans.

It just feel like there's no reason for me to be alive, because I'm tapped out in trying to improve myself, there's only so much I can do alone on my own. I just feel so hopeless, like the best case scenario in my life now is that I cope until I can't anymore, and then I kill myself. I feel like that time is coming soon. I just want to be able to hold a job, and live a life, but I don't think it's going to happen for me.",24Feb2019,1
72,"Whenever I was 14, I was at a chinese restraunt with my mom when I had my first panic attack. There was nothing inparticular that triggered it. A few weeks later after that experience, I went back to that same chinese restraunt which triggered another attack. But after that day and on for the next week i had severe panic attacks in waves with a short 5-10 minute calm down between each one. It was so terrifying and debilitating. I couldnt go outside, i woke up every morning with my heart pounding, i could barely eat and i just constantly felt like i was going to faint. Which i did a couple of times during that time when the attacks were very intense. After that week my mom finally took me to the doctor and i was put on an ssri. It fixed everything for me thankfully. But ive tried to google what happened to me and from what i understand its not normal to have an ongoing panic attack for that long of a period of time.

75,"I have depression, anxiety, and OCD. I think I might have OCPD. I've been in therapy and on different medications for the last 5 years with varying success. I'm trying to manage chronic headaches I've had for over a year.

For the last two years, I've slowly withdrawn from different communities I was a part of. I went to college for a year and didn't return. My seasonal job came to its natural conclusion. January of 2018 is when I pretty much stopped talking to everyone I know except my family. All these social and work groups knew I had mental health and chronic pain issues to varying degrees, but probably wonder why I withdrew from these personal and professional relationships into complete silence.

I am paralyzed by anxiety everyday, and am disgusted at the privilege that allows me to completely isolate myself without real consequences. It's hard to explain why I do this, but I suppose I believe I either need to accomplish greater things than I was in order to justify my existence, or greater pain/suffering to justify my failure to do that. I couldn't be who I wanted to be, so I just stopped existing. And every month that I continued to be mediocre at life, I had to explain myself to my peers or lie so they wouldn't suspect that I'm a fraud. I hated the feeling of being asked how I was doing, only to report that for the 20th consecutive month, I was doing worse than the last month. When I got tired of doing that, I would just gradually cut off contact.

My new therapist has helped a lot, and I feel like I accomplish things every day now. But I am still house-bound, worried I'll run into people I used to know if I leave my house. I want to rekindle these relationships, but how do I explain where I've been? How much do I have to disclose? How big does the apology have to be? Can I lie if it's to protect my dignity/privacy? I hate to contribute to the stigma, but I don't know how to take this step in a way that preserves myself. I'm embarrassed and tired.",24Feb2019,1
76,"So ever since I was like really young, I've noticed that I've never really had a emotional attachment to almost anyone including my family. Even as a kid, I've never had a best friend. I Just didn't believe in becoming that close to anyone. I do have friends and family and I really do care for them. But if I really did have some sort of attachment to them, it shouldn't be this easy for me to just cut them off of my life whenever I wish. It's scary how cold hearted I can be sometimes. I first realized this when I was like 10 years old. I used to have a really good friend until one day I moved to a different place so we hardly talked. My friend's father was abusive and her mother had commited suicide shortly after I moved. My friend had literally no one else to turn to she would call me so she could talk. But I had new friends at the new place so my friend was of no importance to me. I would make excuses whenever she called and stopped picking up her calls entirely. My mother noticed this and asked me how I could just cut off my friend like that. That's when I realized that it wasn't normal. I'm 18 now and things are the same, if not worse. I think it's important to let everyone know that I was sexually abused by my own father at a very young age. My parents were constantly fighting and there was violence involved most of the time. I now suffer from depression and even though I have not been diagnosed, I really think I suffer from several other mental illnesses. Whether it is really because of them or not, I blame my family. That's why I have distance myself from them as well. I mean I know I do not form emotional attachments to others, but I atleast expected to be attached to my family. But it's not really that hard for me to forget about them. Is there an illness where people don't form emotional bonds with others? ",24Feb2019,1

78,"Up until about this time last year, I was seeing an EDMR specialist for my repressed trauma. I had been sexually assaulted and then abused for years by my ex boyfriend over the assault (calling me and asking me deeply personal and uncomfortable questions about what happened, asking me what I had worn over and over, calling me a slut, not letting me sleep) because he was ~jealous~ of the guy who did it. I had been drugged and I would often get triggered but not remember enough about what had happened to understand why. I started seeing an EDMR therapist and it took like 6 months before she thought I was “ready” for EDMR. When we finally got to it, it did absolutely nothing. I couldn’t get comfortable or let my walls down enough to make any progress. After that she told me it was “probably better if I didn’t remember what happened” and started being late to every single one of our appointments. At the time I was in high school and leaving classes early to see her, her office was a bit of a drive. When I got there she would be 45 min to and hour late every single time and when she finally got around to me she would try to reschedule our appointments completely. It was incredibly hurtful and SUPER unprofessional, I know I still have a lot of residual trauma even though I have worked through a lot of things on my own. I would like to seek more help but it is so much time and money just for the chance of something like that happening again.

Basically my friend who has anxiety (and I can relate, I have anxiety, depression and ADHD) was stressing out over school and assessments, and I was trying to help her out. I was supposed to be doing homework, and when my mum found out that I wasn't doing it, she got really mad. I explained it to her, and she said, ""I'll give you 5 minutes."" 5 minutes isn't nearly enough for me to help her. I asked for 15 minutes, and she said, ""now you're not getting your phone back tomorrow. Don't argue with me about this.""

Excuse me!?!? She took me to a GP about my self harming, depression, anxiety and ADHD, so I know she understands this shit. But she won't give me more than 5 minutes to help one of my best friends out with something that's bothering her SO much. And I could almost hear the pain behind what she was typing out. 

""You know that drowning feeling? Yeah, got that right now.""

""It's like no matter how much work I do I feel like it's never enough and the drowning feeling comes.""

""I work non stop everyday and it feels like I do nothing.""

85,"Ok, firstly I have been diagnosed with ADD. I don't feel like the diagnosis totally gels with me though. In fact, the only thing I feel like I can in common with ADDers is that I generally struggle with life. I can sit down and read a book and I don't think I am more forgetful than average. I also, unfortunately, do not have the ADDer's gift of ""hyperfocus"". Anyway, here ARE the unusual behaviors and struggles that I deal with:

Socially awkward/poor social skills

&amp;#x200B;

Constant daydreaming (leads to awkward behavior like if I am daydreaming in public and suddenly laugh out loud at the movie that I am watching in my head)

&amp;#x200B;

Weird physical ticks like hand flapping, suddenly running (getting up and sprinting for a sec... I do it impulsively and have been frequently ""caught"" doing it to my embarrassment but I have gotten better about suppressing the urge and only do it in privacy now). The ticks are usually a response to me feeling excited about something. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a sleep schedule that moves around the clock. For instance, if I am waking up at 6 am and going to bed at 10 pm, eventually I will wake up at 9 am and go to bed at 11 pm. Then it will be 10 am to 12 am... and so on and so on until it's extreme and I am going to bed at 6 am and sleeping all day until 2 pm. Eventually it returns to a normal looking schedule. This happens regardless of what I do. I have had to force myself to go without sleep to go to school or work.

&amp;#x200B;

I have only been able to find one job that I haven't been fired from... as a data entry clerk. With other jobs I couldn't deal with multitasking or working fast enough. I am a really fast typist and I believe that's the only reason I am able to do the job. 

&amp;#x200B;

I get my left and right confused and get lost in buildings easily. I have a hard time following directions and honestly can't use the public transportation in my city because of it.

&amp;#x200B;

So I definitely think something is up with me. But none of the disorders sound like me IMO. I just really wish I could pinpoint it. When I have seen therapists I have been diagnosed with ADHD/depression or run into the ""I prefer to treat the symptoms,  not the diagnosis"" types. Also, I am pretty sure I am not depressed. I get really frustrated and have crying spells, but I actually an energetic and chipper person most of the time. I just wish there was a label I could get behind so I could understand myself better.

88,"Temptation feels good. It feels liberating, new, and rebellious. The aftermath isn’t pretty however. The yucky feelings of misery, guilt, and shame. You begin to question why you chased after temptation if you knew damn well that you would eventually regret it?

Same goes with alcohol. The euphoric and playful state you’re in feels like escaping reality. But then those pseudo-happy feelings kinda wear off and you end up so displeased physically and mentally. And I believe this only happens when you’re drinking as a coping mechanism, not for fun. 

I hate how anxiety’s nervous energy makes me want to give in to temptation. I also hate how I’m blaming anxiety and depression for my decisions. Bizarrely, I just want to fuck shit up, ruin someone’s life, and then continue to ruin my life but then I don’t. I know this is something that one can control with the mind but that’s easier said than done. 

Now, I’m in an empty parking lot having a mini emotional breakdown because I feel stuck in a mundane, repetitive cycle. I don’t feel loved. I want to love yet everything I touch, I destroy. There’s a lot of hope for my future but the seeds I’ve nurtured are sprouting at a slow pace. I’m impatient but I can get through this.

89,"I'm writing an application and have asked for feedback from a few people. At first, receiving suggestions for clarification isn't difficult. As the process goes on, I receive suggestions about whether the content of what I've actually written is good or not. Don't write this, don't write that, you don't want to appear like this, you want to appear like that.

This feels less like my form needs work, and more like my content was misdirected. Being that this is an application, it feels as though I ought to try not to be myself. This is exhausting. I don't feel like my ego's taken a blow, but I do feel as though I'm suddenly too tired to continue squeezing myself into a performance like a square peg in a round hole.

90,"I don't know what the fuck I have but it's pushing me to the edge. I don't want to give away my personal life story, but a lot of shit has happened to me while I was still young. I'm going through adolescence right now so I'm not sure if it's related. Basically I went through a stage of depression and suicidal thoughts, nothing to serious, then I was pretty much kicked out to live with someone else because my original owner couldn't deal with me. I was half forced out of depression then, having to live with some people I really didn't want to. I still wanted to live with my original owner and so after about a month I was able to go back home. Many people thought it wasn't a good idea to go back because it seemed as though that place was the only reason I was depressed. But they were all fucking idiots who didn't know a tenth of the story and wouldn't care to listen to it. Anyway I'm back home now and I've stopped feeling anything. I stopped feeling happiness about 2/3 years before depression, but now I stopped feeling everything. I can't tell if it's better or worse than feeling sad. Anyway I seem to have started feeling the tiniest bit of emotions every now and then so I just hope they come back naturally. None of that shit that I wrote really matters. The thing that does is that every so often I get a kind of giant wave of emotion over me. It's fucking torture. It's not even physical pain of any sort, nothing you can describe. It's just mental pain. Like I'm mad over something that doesn't exist, sad over nothing, just huge amounts of bad emotions. I'll usually cry, and clench my muscles or some shit as it happens. It doesn't do anything physical, just mental. I've seemed to figure out that it only happens when I'm alone and have no human interactions and it'll last from 3 minutes to 10. I've found ways to kinda avoid it. When I got them late at night I could usually just distract my self by looking at something on my phone, leading to sleepless nights, and mornings where I'm so tired I hallucinate. Pain is another way that works. It's strangely effective, just having the blade of a serrated knife roll over my hand or arm (it's not cutting, it's just the pain I feel). I've heard of mental breakdowns but I feel like this something else. It's kinda late as I'm writing this and it's right after I had one of those mental seizures so I apologise if this doesn't make sense or if I seem agitated. I've tried writing about it before but I just couldn't. Also I've seen a therapist but they do jack shit.",24Feb2019,1

99,"I am currently taking Prozac 20mg for depression/anxiety, and I think it's starting to help (but I'm not sure). I was also taking Xanax for panic attacks and recently tried a meta-blocker after meeting with a psychiatrist (but it doesn't work... at all). When I woke up this morning, I felt really anxious about going back to work tomorrow. I calmed down a bit after taking my daily Prozac.

&amp;#x200B;

I like my current therapist, but in the last session I was suggested to getting screened for ADD by my psychiatrist to rule it out. I highly doubt I have ADD- I had students in the past diagnosed with ADD/ADHD. I'm actually pretty organized, and  I like organizing things. My current depression/anxiety is heavily work related, and I was super happy and relaxed this week (midwinter recess for some public schools).

&amp;#x200B;

I was overall a really confident person as a child, and I didn't  struggle that much in school. I was fine for the most part even in college. My therapist asked when my confidence started to change so much, and I said when I started teaching. I am in my third year of teaching at the same school. I confided that I don't know if I can go back to current school if I am unsuccessful with my job hunting- and was told to consider if I need to go back. Is it possible to take some time off teaching and do some tutoring if I can't find another school? I don't know. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry for my current students, but I feel *really* miserable and depressed. My heart races dealing with parents and talking to administration. I stopped letting kids in during lunch because I'm tired of putting a big smile on my face in front of the kids. It is difficult to start work. It is difficult going to work. My mother suggested in the mean time to just do the bare minimum and focus on enjoying things outside of work-- and I think I'll do that. I feel like I have turned into a different person. I'm not even expecting to enjoy my job anymore- I just want to be normal and just *go.* I'm just really frustrated with myself and just need to vent.",24Feb2019,1
100,"I am a 22 years old guy and as the title announces, I've never had a sexual intercourse in my life. But that is just the top of the iceberg.
Since I was really young, I've had problems relating with other people. I remember that as a kid I would find uncomfortable also when had to communicate something to my own relatives, in fact I used to spend most of my time without speaking. At this age (6-7) I make my first friends, they will be almost the only friends I make by myself and I'm still friend with them now.

My parents never had enough money and time to bring to a therapist, so I grew up with my parents trying to making me more ""normal"", but most of the time this just meant having them telling me what to do or not to do so that people around don't think bad of me (example: ""don't do that otherwise people will think you are stupid). I spent my early teenage years waiting for them to pass away, as a external viewer, hoping in some miracolous change in my life. During adolescence I find out that I could have a bit of peace by alterating my mind with substances. Luckily I've always had everything under control (apart for the time wasted), for example alcohol never disinhibited me or made me do nothing crazy or stuff like that, I always rember everything even after an exaggerated night of drinks, when usually other people have memory blanks (I'm not an alcoholic or something, I don't drink that regularly) 
I've never been looking for a girlfriend (never had one), but I never felt sad or inappropriate about it I just never felt the need of it.
Now I'm a 22yo with problems of social anxiety, low self esteem and everything related (never diagnosed cause I haven't been to a therapist yet).  

I think I've made a lot of progress in recent years. I left my parents home at 20yo, to go live in another country where I now work and maintain  myself and I'm a lot more confident with my speaking. If you could see me, you would probably consider me a perfectly ""normal"" person, In fact I am a ""normal productive member of society"". But if you were to try to get a bit more intimate, or just to try to getting to know me better, you would understand at first that there is something that is not right with me. I'm extremely introverted, I usually don't speak unless have to and when I do, I rarely feel comfortable with it (despite the confidence), I will always instinctively try to make the conversation as short as possible. I keep my opinions for myself, together with my good and bad feelings. I'm unable to accept or give compliments as well as critics. I usually constantly think of all of these defects and Im constantly trying to hide them during my everyday life by forcing me to ""look normal"". And I'm afraid that this forcings and pretendings are the only cause of my progress. 

Now I arrive to the hot part: sex. 
If  the problems described above are valid for my relationship with people in general, you need to make them double when it comes to the opposite sex. 
As I said before I've never had a girlfriend and not even good female friends after my childhood. In my current group of friends there are many girls that I consider as such, and they consider me a friend too but I've never had the slightest moment of, even just friendly, intimacy with any of them (you know those moments in which you are just with 1 friend and you both start sharing your thoughts with the other person? I've never had that). Ive had occasions, I just avoided them. When I'm face to face with a girl I usually start sweating, my voice  can tremble, my mind goes black leaving me muted or making me say idiotic and pointless things. The curious thing that I have observed is that I can be a lot more confident when I am 100% sure that the girl Im talking with doesn't have any kind of sexual or romatinc interest in me. Now ill get to the point. It has been 1 year now that I feel like I'm living a second part of my puberty. I want to have sex, and for the first time so strongly. I still dont know if I want to be in a romantic relationship but what I know is that I feel the unceasing need to finally open myself physically and emotionally to someone. You would say: ""now that you want it, go out and meet someone like everybody do.""
I do that. I go to pubs, sometime clubs (very rarely and only with other friends that really want to go), I travel and often meet new people. That doesnt fix the block that I have with women. I often have the chance to find a sexual partner quite easily (not thanks to me😅), but only when girls try to pick me up. For example there was this girl at work that, from the first day we met, she made me understand that she was interested in me sexually, giving me sexy looks and smiles or even more direct appreciation of my physical appearance. But apart for give back the looks and  smiles I didnt know what to do so I decided to become a friend with her, and getting to know her better, I think slowly fell in love with her. I think she liked me too, she also came to my house several times and I'm quite sure that once she was totally expecting me to make a move on her. We were sitting on my bed chatting and smoking some weed for hours and I could see from her eyes that she wanted it but at that point I felt blocked again and I didn't do nothing and I could see again from her eyes the disappointment when she left. We stayed friends anyway, until she understand that I felt something more for her (she was clear from the beginning that she wasn't looking for a boyfriend). And this was the first time that I actually tried to build a real connection with a girl in my life, and it was there.
But that's nothing, when I go to clubs, often I have girls (sometimes also males😅) that try with me. For example one night I had these 2 girls dancing together in front of me (I was standing near the wall drinking a beer and not dancing) and they started to come closer until they were literally bumping their ass on me. You would say that's a perfect situation for someone that want to have sex, and I wanted it. But guesswhat? I stood still moving a bit away waiting for the girl to get bored and dance away. I felt like all the progress I made were being sucked by the absolute void of my mind. And that same night it happened a similar thing with several different girls.
Sometime I think Im an hopeless case, other times I feel so close to free myself from, I suppose, self-built chains. 

Just to be clear I'm not even slightly asexual, but I reckon that in my childhood I was more active than in my adolescence. I remember that when I was about 4 years old I used to get naked and rub my perineum on the carpet at home feeling pleasure. I had my first erection when I was about 7 or 8 but after that I dont remember anymore sexual activity until I was almost 17, when I actually masturbated to the ejaculation for the first time. 
 
Thank to everyone who arrived to the end of all of this, I tried to put all the details so to avoid misunderstandings and doubts, hope this is the appropriate sub for having an external opinion on my situation.

105,"So basically over the past couple of months I’ve started to get some pretty distressing thoughts just randomly pop into my head and some of these thoughts are of a sexual nature and involve my own family members.

Now to give a bit of backstory I’ve been dealing with intimacy issues since my early teens, like most young people I started watching porn when I was quite young and I definitely think this has had a huge negative impact on me as I’m almost certain this is what has caused some form of ED. I don’t really know if this can have an affect on what’s currently going on but I thought it important to mention just in case.

I currently see a therapist and it has really helped me in this respect but in the past couple of months I have been getting some thoughts that pop into my head that really make me worry about my mental health/state. I have never had these kind of thoughts before. I get sexual thoughts pop into my head about my sister and other family members. I have absolutely no intention to act on these thoughts and they repulse me and make me actually quite worried about myself.

I tried my first suicide when I was 13 by taking my mom’s car and running it into a lake.

Substances even helped me get through school because there is no way I would have had to motivation to finish without them.

My current failings in life bombard my thoughts from the get-go and I’m not even out from the covers before I’m riddled with anxiety. I feel like an ingrate for complaining about my life. I have friends but I don’t feel like they really like being around me. Maybe because I don’t like the things I say, or do. I find myself always observing the most popular person in the group. I watch what they say and do so maybe I can get that reaction from people, and they’ll be enthused by my company. They tell you to love yourself, be yourself, and in turn people will like you. I observe myself and I don’t see things people my age want to be around. I’m not terrible looking, but I’m awkward and quiet. I fit in well enough at parties and people are more then willing to talk to me, but I feel like I’m dead all the time, and it shows. Anytime I start to have fun and feel myself merge with the people I’m around, my throat will tighten to remind me I’m not really a part of this culture. I just feel like I’ve whole-fully failed as a person. I was alienated when I was younger, and all I’ve ever wanted was to be somebody people acknowledge when they’re walking past. Somebody that has meaning. Because I can’t give that meaning to myself. I have no diagnosis for anything, but I’ve had panic attacks since I was young. I’m sorry if this doesn’t fit here, or isn’t the content you guys are looking for. I just figured someone who has their shit together more then me can help me.",24Feb2019,1

So if you’re unaware, I made my first post to this community today, and it was about me being inside of my 2nd day without self harming.
The attention it received was overwhelming and the support has put me in one of the best moods I’ve been in for a while.

123,"I’m 18 and have a lot of siblings, all younger than me. Considering the circumstances, I’ve obviously had to share a lot of things in my life, be it items or attention. This has never bothered me too much, or at least I never noticed it. Inside the last few years though, I’ve noticed something.

I cannot stand my brothers liking the same movies as me, playing the same games or anything like that. It’s very rarely any issue when a friend likes the same stuff, quite the opposite really. I like it when I have someone to discuss them with. When I like something, be it a sports club or a movie, I get very passionate about it. But when it’s my brothers, I get genuinely angry.

I don’t understand this at all. You’d think that it’d be nice to have shared interests with someone in the family. But whenever my brother mentiones something about a movie I like, I just feel like I want to punch his face in. (Don’t worry, I wouldn’t actually do anything like that. I’m not quite *that* messed up, I think.)",24Feb2019,1

126,"I am 19 years old (live in wonderful of Texas), I live with my parents who do not have health insurance. I have not seen a doctor since I was required by the state for school when I was 12.

So I have been struggling with undiagnosed mental problems for a long time. I have had social anxiety since I was a kid and it has only gotten worse through the years, I also had my childhood stutter return which is really affecting my confidence and ability to socially function. I've also been suicidal probably since I was 14, and it's really gotten worse through the years. Based off internet research (so take it with a grain of salt), I think there is a good chance I have Borderline Personality Disorder; I suffer from most of the symptoms like regular self-harming (I cut everyday), unstable self-image and identity (especially when it comes to orientation and gender), dissociation (usually happens when I am talking to someone), I have volatile relationships with my few family members and friends, but at the same time I intensely fear that will leave me or kick me out. And I have intense episode of depression and anxiety that last for variable amounts of time, and of course I always feel empty and always like I should be doing something else. Regardless of what is specifically I could have, I know something is very wrong and I need professional help.

So my question is, honestly what do you do in a situation like this? I've been trying to find very low cost healthcare options, but I haven't found anything that I could possibly afford (which is very little), especially since these problems are really affecting my ability to land any sort of job (I really am trying, despite what my parents say). Even then I imagine there's lots of mental things that are not covered regardless on cheap plans.

It just feel like there's no reason for me to be alive, because I'm tapped out in trying to improve myself, there's only so much I can do alone on my own. I just feel so hopeless, like the best case scenario in my life now is that I cope until I can't anymore, and then I kill myself. I feel like that time is coming soon. I just want to be able to hold a job, and live a life, but I don't think it's going to happen for me.",24Feb2019,1

131,"Hello. So just recently (few hours ago) we found out that my younger brother might have schizophrenia. It's taken us all by surprise. He has some more evaluations coming today-but I don't know what to do. I want to support my parents and other brother but feel dumbfounded and sad. I live in another state- with my husband and won't be sharing this info with him yet as this is not my news to share. I just don't know what to do- and I'd appreciate some help and guidance. Thank you all in advance.

**Just some more background info- he's always been a little quieter than the rest of us and a bit socially awkward/bullied. He's had some life events in the past few months that we're hard on him(not getting into a program he worked hard for). He doesn't make friends that easily but is a caring and loving person. Up until now we thought it was ADHD/depression. He was driving recklessly and would come home at strange hours-and leave at strange hours. This is what promoted my parents to take him to the hospital and they diagnosed him there with a 40 questions-evaluation and said Schizophrenia. We have a family friend who is a child psychiatrist and will be talking with him today to further evaluate him. My question is-will my brother ever bounce back from this? He's changed in the last few months and I miss him, worry about him, and want him to have a normal life ",24Feb2019,2
132,I still have morals and feelings and all that stuff but i dont get worried or stress and cant understand why people stress about things. When i was told i was having a another little brother i was happy but had to fake a reaction so that i wouldnt come across as rude or strange and when he was born people found it weird that i would barely look at him or talk to him or hold which i find weird cause hes just a baby you look at them once youve seen all there is to see. My friends think im weird cause i never tell them important stuff happening in my life (such as that i was having a brother) or other things like going on holidays. I never get excited for things either which is the weirdest too me because i used to get super excited for things and now i never do.

133,"Hello! I am fourteen. My crush is a grade above me. I liked him for almost one and a half years. We went to the same school and were in choir and art club together. I haven't seen him since may. Earlier however, he acted interested. He would stare and on some occasions be overly nice. I told him I liked him in august. He said i'm a friend. I tried to make it look like I moved on. I said ok glad we are friends tho lol that's all cool. So a few times I asked him to hang out with mutual friends. He has a busy lifestyle however (ik its true trust me). So I asked his number( keep in mind this is all via school email). He said his phone was broke and he doesn't use it so email was a good contact method. His phone was old. So that's true ik. so I sent an email asking hows school and choir and art and all and said hopefully we can get together sometime

&amp;#x200B;

It had been a while and he didn't respond. I mean he takes forever usually but this was a ton longer than usual. So I said I know its hard to hang out with busy schedules. When are you free? Then later suggested a date and said how about here on this date or another date? He hasn't responded yet to anym

&amp;#x200B;

I love him and I've never missed anyone this much. He is one of those people who change you so much you can never move on. So that's just not an option. Closure at the least is needed. I don't care whether this ends in friendship or more. I want to shoot an email saying hey I've been trying to reach out but u never answered. If u don't want to keep in touch that's fine, just tell me bcz that solves confusion.

135,"So, all my adult life I've been saying I'm only crazy because I don't have enough money to be excentric. 

History is full of rich people who would have super weird behaviour, like being so painfully shy they never talked to anyone and ordered their house staff to act like they were invisible if they came across the rich person in the hallway. Scientists who contributed in a major way to our understanding of the world who seemed to go into an autistic preoccupation tailspin and studied nothing but alchemy for a decade. Stuff like that. A lifestyle that wouldn't have worked if they weren't rich.

So, a lot of people who have mental health issues might be able to live in some sort of comfort if they were rich. It also seems to me that quite a lot of people who are poor wouldn't have half the issues they are dealing with if they had enough money for basics like proper housing and a therapist.

Sometimes I have certain urges and I wonder if it's me being excentric or being crazy. I got this fascination with tattooing so I decided to tattoo myself and everyone who heard about it called me crazy for it. I did it anyway, it turned out good and now they are fans and want me to tattoo them too. So basically, it would have been considered excentric or crazy, depending on how the tattoo came out. But that's artistic merit, not anything objective like you shouldn't stab yourself repeatedly with a needle ever. My therapist wrote it down as a tendency to self harm until I showed the result and now it says I'm trying to get a paid job by teaching myself tattooing. Isn't that weird? It's self harm unless it's pretty?

I have always had a strong urge to run away and even though I have a semi stable place to live, I want to go for it now that I have my drivers license. I got into the vanlife hype, but then I had some financial setbacks and now I'm going to use a car instead of a van. And now people are calling me crazy again, for wanting to sleep in a car as I travel around Europe. I understand for most people sleeping in a hipster Volkswagen seems like travel and sleeping in a car seems like you're homeless and deprived of basic comfort... But it still feels weird that a van is slightly excentric and a car is batshit crazy. A tent would be just as big, backpacking would be less comfortable, but it's just not something you do, I guess. It's frowned upon. 

Does this make sense to anyone? Like how people decide what's crazy seems arbitrary to you?

I have autism and to wind down I watch the same movies over and over and over. Probably seen each one at least 300 times now (there's about 20 I use for this). It's just on in the background while I write in my diary or hang out with my dog. If it was a cd, nobody would think it weird. But because it's a movie, my therapist has written it down as proof I have OCD. I could go on.

So the Imgur album is a sample of this guy's posts from the last few days. I originally posted to /r/insanepeoplefacebook, but felt bad because that's mostly used for comedy and this guy's problems might be more serious.

&amp;#x200B;

In summary, I knew this guy a little bit in college. He was a year or two above me. He studied philosophy, and he was just kind of a weird (though harmless) personality. Just a bit grandiose. He went for some positions in student government, though never really got that far, and I think he overall had an inflated sense of himself. Never graduated.

&amp;#x200B;

His posts just started to get weirder and weirder over the years. I remember in 2014, he said that he was going to walk around campus while reading out loud from Thoreau, and anyone was welcome to join him. Then he started claiming he went to Yale (he didn't) on FB, then he started claiming he went to Oxford, Harvard, MIT, and a bunch of other prestigious places (he didn't), and to have some European ancestry. Gradually this devolved, and now he claims to be King of the UK, to be genetically superior, to have an IQ of above 230, et cetera, et cetera. Not too sure what he actually does, but he occasionally tries to sell lumber from his backyard and has claimed to start a business. People rarely interact with his FB posts, though he posts several times a day.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I'm a bit afraid, from the content of his posts, that he might get to the point where he can hurt himself or others. Talking to him isn't the most useful thing; he messaged me a few times last year (before he used the N word so frequently in his posts), and you can't really reason him out of his delusions (though he never gets angry when contradicted). Is there any recourse to take? Like, can he be committed? Or a mental health professional that might be able to reach out to him? Does anyone have any experience with stuff like this?",24Feb2019,1

It's disheartening and horrible. I didn't think I'd feel normal again forever, I knew I would have a bad day again but I didn't think it'd hit this hard.

146,"I am a 20 year old guy who used to be very happy and confident in myself. I've always had a good group of friends and always had set high goals for myself but an incident happened about a couple months ago that has changed my attitude and my outlook on everything. I realize that I have been acting different and I've had no desire to do anything anymore. I don't even want to do anything with my friends anymore and just make up excuses to not do anything. All i want to do is sleep because I do not get any enjoyment out of things I used to anymore. It seems that I am a totally different person and that I've also lost my ability to think straight and communicate with people. I think this depression that I am in has affected everything in my life and I do not know how I am ever going to get back. I feel like I can't add anything to conversations and feel out of the loop with everything. I am also in a fraternity at my school that you would think would be a place to feel safe and secure in. But I don't feel apart of it anymore and I dont feel apart of anything. I don't even come around anymore because I fear I don't have anything to add to it and have a social anxiety even around people that I know. Because of this, I've just been going back and forth to school without making much contact or conversation with other people which has made me feel more alone and sad, but I realize that I've done this to myself. It's weird because I've been someone that has been fairly well liked but now I feel like no one likes me or wants to be with me. I use to talk to a lot of girls at school, being in a fraternity and all having that platform helps and I still talk to this one girl that I really like and she really likes me. She is the only one that I talk to on an everyday basis which I am very grateful for. She honestly gives me a lot of strength to keep going and gives me a lot of encouragement as well as my one friend in my fraternity who also reaches out to me all the time. I think a big problem is that I don't have a sense of belonging anymore because I've isolated myself so much everybody and everything and I dont know how to get back my confidence again. My one friend that I do everything with is someone I feel comfortable around and can be around other people with him, but when I am not there with this person then I feel a sense of lossness and uneasieness which is not good. There is 100 people in my fraternity so why am I so shy around them and not able to act normal? Is it too late to try to still make a connection with these guys even if I haven't made a strong connection with them yet? I am not really sure, but this has pretty much been my life in a nutshell and I really want a fresh start. I know things can be worse for me, but I think the worst part about everything is that I feel like I cannot connect with anyone anymore. I have become very self conscious and feel like I have lost my identity as a person. I don't know who I am anymore or what I really stand for. This has affected my grades and my ability to concentrate because this sense of not feeling loved or out of place has controlled my thinking at all times. I've even thought about taking a semester off from school if it gets bad enough although I really don't want to because I feel like it will just make things worse in the end. Again, I just don't know what to do anymore. I know the logical thing would to just put myself out there again and stop isolating myself but its not so easy. I know I need to force myself to do this, even when I'm with the girl I like I feel out of place. She is great because shes the complete opposite of me (outgoing, overly friendly, and cheerful) and somehow she has really started to like me. Although we aren't dating, we still have sex and have an intimate relationship that could potentially lead to that. That makes me happy and its definently something I don't want to lose along with the few friends that I still talk to at the moment. I want to have a lot of friends and just be comfortable with myself again, where do I start and how do I get back on the right path slowly and gradually. I should also say that I was someone that would like to drink and smoke almost every weekend and along with being in a fraternity, there are parties about 1-2 times a week. Some people have asked about me since I haven't been around at all for a while now which makes me feel good. At the same time, I just don't feel like I have an identity anymore and the thought of harming myself has definently crossed my mind. I have avoided this fraternity scene for a month now and have not wanted to drink or smoke either, mostly spending my weekends not wanting to do anything. I just want my life back and some advice.

I've been in and out of therapy for most of my life, and the last several therapists I have ultimately end up telling me that they're not qualified to help. One suggested a few places last spring, but the majority of the doctors they recommended  specialized in children, or don't accept my insurance. As someone who is not employed and unable to maintain employment from mental problems, if my insurance doesn't cover it all I can't do it.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been on meds for depression and anxiety but I don't know the names of the ones who worked and no one can seem to find it any of my medical records since I was about 14 or so when it was prescribed. It could have been paroxetine? I've been on other medicine more recently that didn't really do much but my las therapist, who I no longer see, suggested I go back on them. Unfortunately, I don't have the willpower to live, let alone go shopping for a doctor who can help with my complicated medical problems, let alone will continue to treat me like a normal person after finding out I'm transgender. My last doctor didn't treat me very well when I came out to her and left her practice a few months ago. A lot of my problems are triggered by my voice, so using the phone is incredibly hard and it can take a whole week for me to be able to psych myself up to make one, but lately I haven't been able to.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what to do anymore or what kind of doctor to go to. I've never ""qualified"" for in patient treatment, despite the fact I've tried to get into it three times for severe depression and suicidal ideations. It's been suggested to me from the last three therapists I have to seek inpatient treatment for severe depression in the past, but they always leave it all up to me to figure out how to do this even when I tell them I can't do it myself. The last time I tried to get help for suicidal ideations that were becoming urges, it didn't end well and possibly traumatized me. Now I'm afraid to ask for help.

&amp;#x200B;

Things I will absolutely not try(so please don't mention it, even if it worked for you and you were once against it) anything relating to drugs like LSD, magic mushrooms or ketamine, benzodiazepines, and otherwise psychoactive drugs that can treat depression in very specific circumstances.

LISW therapists are not what I am looking for and have told me they are not qualified to help because of how severe my depression is.

149,"Yeah. It hurts. My best friend [16F] is basically leaving me. Since I started high school, she's been my only friend all these years. Probably because she's the only one who doesn't mind being a friend with the person who's most bullied.

We were so so so close. Through these years no one had been closer to me and vice versa. We never hid secrets from each other.

Maybe I have fallen in love with her but I always dumbed these thoughts away all these years because she doesn't like like me.

We have been so fine. Unfortunately, she's got a boyfriend [25M] who's a muscular guy with a beard. I wasn't having a problem with it until I noticed that she's pushing me away.

She's never been like that to me despite how close we were. Seems she isn't close anymore. And she's now closer to her BF and trusts him more.

It is not about the friendzone, life just sucks. I mean I suck. Life sucks. Both suck. It hurts. I never hurt myself because I am always very optimistic. However, I don't know what to feel anymore than empty.

But for few years something else happening.
I would  imagine embarrassing things that never happened to me.

so it'll be like 
""if that would/will happen to how embarrassing that could be""

and that gives me anxiety on a high level some I have run out of the room and lock myself in the bathroom.

I try to stop my imagination but can't 
.
And for few months another thing is happening to me when I'm alone I Imagine some person is with me so I have to behave in a way like that person is actually with me .

for example if I watch movie my I start to imagine
that the actor in the movie is with me so I have to behave in a way I would behave if  the actor is actually with me.

it don't only happen with celebrity some time I think about relative

152,"I am a 17 year old girl about to go to college and I have felt alone all my life. I don’t have any friends or family. Ever since I was young I was made fun of and I always just felt so different from everyone like i was an alien or something, and when i was around 13 or so i made a plan that i would kill myself if things didn’t get better by the time i turned 18. They haven’t gotten any better, in fact they have gotten worse. I do very good in school but every weekend i watch all of these people that i know from school go out and have fun while i sit trapped in my room. Recently i started dating a boy and it was amazing for the first month until i realized that he was a narcissist and completely changed his personality over time so that he could manipulate my emotions to boost his ego. At first i thought i deserved it but after 9 months i feel like it’s been long enough and that i should finally break up with him. For anybody else this would be an obvious and easy choice but I am scared to because it means i will be all alone again. I am going to therapy and i like my therapist but im pretty sure that no matter what i do i will never be able to break out of this. i doubt anyone will see this but if you do please help me i feel so trapped inside my own head.",24Feb2019,1
153,"I'm a male in my 30's, and admittedly, I have had a pretty great life. Loving family, great friends, good job, no financial problems basically ever - which is why it pains me that I live basically every day with a glass half full outlook, when I know there's no real reason for it. Everything is a cause for concern or nervousness, and I don't know how to combat it. Basically nothing in my life, minus sitting alone at my place watching Netflix, comes with calm. 

...and these things are so relatively minor, that they occupy so much space in my head, that it seems there's no room for anything, well, important. For example, I play in a dart league, and we've got a big game coming up - I'm the best player on the team, and all I can think about this entire week is not playing poorly, living up to expectations, not embarrassing myself by getting nervous, not letting my team down, etc. There's no ""joy"" leading up to it - there usually is joy on darts night at the end of the night when I'm nice and liquor'd up, but this is too much. I'm lost in negative thoughts and feel incapacitated by my fixation on it. I'm also finding that alcohol is the only thing that flips the switch and lets me truly enjoy things, which I know is as dangerous as it sounds.

Similarly, I'm being forced to find a new apartment, and been given a limited time to do so, and my stress is through the roof. It's not a financial thing at all, it's a pressure thing, and I'm completely lost in the thoughts of how much of a pain it is to find a place, then move everything, and that whole process. 

I know this is more of a rant than anything else, but I'm really frustrated with myself at the moment. I'm in a rut of negative thinking and I feel really on edge, and I kind of feel the hole is getting deeper. ",24Feb2019,1
154,"  

Let me start this with the history of the mental disorders I have been diagnosed with. When I was younger I was diagnosed with inattentive ADHD and learning disabilities in Math and English. Now I’m 19 and within the past years I was diagnosed with combined ADHD and unspecified anxiety and depression along with vaginismus.

So much recently has me thinking that my mental health is much worse than I believe or have let other people believe. I have an extreme fear of knives where every time I see on I will have horrible intrusive thoughts about slitting my throat. These have been going on since I was 14. I have many other intrusive thoughts. One that I’m too ashamed to talk about. But those two are the strongest of what I experience. I have a problem with maladaptive day dreaming as well where a pace back in forth listening to music while day dreaming I have done this religiously since I was 7. I also have ripped the skin off of my lips since I was young. All of these things combined make me believe I may have OCD. Growing up in my family where they were always very passive aggressive about my symptoms didn’t help.

Now These were my initial thoughts but now I’m not sure if it is OCD or what. My phobia of knives is connected to an even bigger problem of mine where I have extreme death anxiety. For about a year everyday I had fits where I believed I was dying. I believe I have a serious illness. Once I even made my mom drive me to the hospital at 1 am because I believed my heart was going to stop. I can’t stub my toe without thinking I’m going to die. I used to think this was just extreme death anxiety until yesterday. Now I believe these are Somatic delusions. Yesterday changed a lot for me where I was going through reddit and found a thread that talked about how “thought broadcasting” is a key sign of schizophrenia where someone believes that others can hear their thoughts. This information sent me through a loop because these last few months I’ve been having fits where I truly believe people are listening to me and judging me especially judging me for my intrusive thoughts. I believed completely my girlfriend could hear everything I was thinking and that anyone I was too close to physically could too. I pride myself on being a materialist and even when I was having these delusions I thought they were so silly but that didn’t make it go away. I have disorganized speech and make up words without knowing they aren’t real, but I still think that has more to do with ADHD and Learning disabilities and when I asked my girlfriend she said I do stumble on my sentences, but she could never not understand what I was saying. I have never seen things that were not there but when I’m in public and only when I’m in public I think I hear very loud whispers (always assuming people are saying mean things about me) but there are always people around, so I can’t tell if there really are people whispering or not.

I smoke a lot of weed since I’ve turned 18. But these symptoms happen even when I am not high or haven’t been high in days. I got out of a very abusive relationship at the end of 2017 and the last time the person did harm to me was in the middle of 2018. I’ve been struggling with this too.

Between School and my multitude of other responsibilities and family problems I don’t feel like I have time for all these mental problems and I wanted to vent about this. I’ve been struggling so much and only have my girlfriend to talk to. I dropped a lot of this on her this morning. I don’t want to rely on her for 100% of my comfort so I made this. I am going to try and go back to therapy, but I’m scared to. ",24Feb2019,1

156,"I have this feeling in my head like I my thoughts are like a beehive. Im having 100 ideas at the same time and cant stop it. Its like TV static, but very loud. I could describe my thoughts best if I took a bunch of ball pens in one hand and just drew this black mass. I freeze, my stare goes out of focus and I see myself from the side. My SO is talking to me, I can hear it, but it's just words that I forget the second I hear them. I can't describe it as very negative feeling, but it's not good also. It's just there and its driving me crazy.

The beehive feeling is constant, I can't shut it down. Ever. I go to sleep with it, my sleep is chaotic, I dream ALOT, I mess up my bed in my sleep becouse I move a lot during my sleep. I wake up tired no matter how long I sleep.

I’m being “forced” by my SO to travel for a wedding soon, which will require me to take a week off work. I’m dreading it, and I feel like me “relaxing” and doing nothing productive for a week will send me into a major depression",24Feb2019,1
158,"I hate my father and know he's been a major contributor to my mental illnesses, most days I want to tell him this and tell him to get out of my life for good but then he'll actually turn up or support me and I realize I still love him and want him in my life despite how he makes me worse. The part of me that hates him wants to blame him for everything but the logical part of me also reminds me that it isn't all his fault. 

He had a psychotic break two months before my sister was born, no one really settled on a diagnosis (personally I think it's BP 2 \[most of the professionals said it was BP\] and schizoaffective PD). The mental illness(es) meant he was really unmotivated to do anything whether that was to look after my sister and I, help out around the house, look for work, or even put effort into his work which caused him to lose several jobs. My mother had been willing to work through it until my father stopped all treatment which is when things really started to go south and their marriage fell apart.

My father left when I was seven or eight during a manic episode to move in with a woman he had met at work. Didn't hear from him for a few months. Then he reestablished contact, called every night, would come over Friday night and stay until he was picked up Sunday evening. Things were cyclical. He'd lose a job, get evicted, move to a new place, find a new job after a year or two, sometimes we would have frequent contact other times we wouldn't hear from him in months, not on holidays, not for birthdays. 

I see him now less than ever. I'm lucky if he turns up for a few hours on Sunday, I'll text him and never get a reply, the only time he contacts me first is to ask if I'm home and if he can visit. I saw him once in November and again in January when my mom bribed him with a night at the movies, haven't heard from him since. A lot of people told me I had to be the one to initiate contact so I used to really make an effort, I emailed, texted, tried to arrange father daughter outings, paying for us to go out. Sometimes I'd hear back in a few hours, sometimes a few days, sometimes never at all, sometimes he'd show up to an outing, other times I'd get a text while busing to the location (or even waiting at the location) telling me he wasn't coming, sometimes I'd wait for him, finally give up and go home only to be texted hours or days later an excuse. He moves around so often and is so paranoid that I don't even know where he lives (not that I really want to spend time in the types of rooms he rents, he hoards and always seems to have horrible housemates).

I catch myself checking my phone constantly on Sundays hoping for a text or sitting by the window hoping to see him walking down the street and I hate myself for it. One of my therapists said this unpredictability was causing me to feel like I was being abandoned over and over again.

Ideally, I want my father back in my life full time, I feel so much better when I see him, I'm socially isolated and he's one of the five people I have sporadic contact with but I have a feeling that one day soon he's going to walk out of my life for the last time. I dread that day but I also wish it had happened years earlier because now it feels inevitable and I could have cut the infected limb off and healed much sooner instead of letting it fester all these years questioning if I was a good enough person, a good enough daughter to garner his attention that week. 

It's 5:30 now, if he were coming this week he'd be here by now. I guess I'll make dinner now, finish cleaning, apply to more jobs, if I'm lucky I'll be hired somewhere soon, perhaps I'll have to work weekends and that outing back in January was the last time I'll ever see my dad. I'm crying just thinking about it, but if that was it then it can hurt now and heal later, but knowing him he'll pop back into my life (perhaps at my wedding if I get married) and renew this cycle of hope and hate and abandonment.

I might feel a bit better if I could have some other people in my life to get emotional support from (it's really just my depressed anxious self with my depressed anxious mother atm, well, us and our depressed anxious cat) but you can't replace a father. I wish I had the strength to tell him to just leave and let me heal. ",24Feb2019,1

160,"I helped my friend unpack yesterday because she just moved. I was happy but was wondering why I was so hyper. I was very efficient at what I was doing, and it was like I was high from having so much energy and it felt great. I was also super talkative. I noticed my friends started acting a little weird like they knew something was up. I’m normally a chill person and although bubbly, I don’t spin in circles like that. It was still good though I broke down all their boxes and got all this stuff done within an hour and a half. I even went grocery shopping afterward and cooked a full course meal for my husband and it tasted great. I was super hyper with him even though I was tired. 

Mania always feels like good day when I have it. I feel like I have my shit together and I’m functioning like any other human being. But then comes the crash. I woke up at 3 am and couldn’t go bk to sleep. I was hearing things all night that startled me out of my sleep, like a boom or a yell. I even thought my husband yelled at me because something woke me up. My brain was telling me to get up and do stuff but my body was so tired I couldn’t move. 

I was supposed to go to church today which brings me so much joy. I was going to serve breakfast. But I had to stay home and now I’m so depressed and tired and thinking about death. I have to get up and clean soon and I just don’t want to. I don’t feel like eating. I know I’m going to be like this for a couple of days but I have to put that mask on and take care of my family and go to work and life just goes on.

Maybe mania hit me at the right time because I got so much done for other people. But the aftermath sucks. At least I didn’t blow through money this time.

My mom goes on live streams a lot to promote her business and I was notified by a family member that she went live and talked about my family's mental health. A couple years back I was hospitalized for suicidal tendencies and she posted about it online and people I didn't even know what weren't part of my family knew that I had a mental illness. I didn't want her to do that and I was upset when it did happen and when I told her I wanted her to take it down she said I was being selfish. Now like I said I am fine with CBD and all that it does, I love the plant. She talked about me, my father, and my sister. My father had past anxiety attacks and suicidal thoughts. My sister has been to the hospital twice now for suicidal tendencies. She mentioned that they both take antidepressants but since they have been taking the CBD they take them on and off. With my experience with antidepressants my doctors have strictly told me that it is not healthy or safe to do this as it could further cause problems with my mental health. My sister is a few years younger than me and so I'm worried that she might be affected by this sooner or later. Anyway, my mother talked about their mental health but every other sentence was about CBD. My family members have also said that it looks like she is trying to just promote her business. My mother lied about my sisters current mental health and my mother is quite... Emotionally abusive.. I will give an example. My sister got in a fight with my parents and messaged her friend that lives right across the street that she needed a break.

Ok so in elementary school I would get these awful dreams about going to school naked, almost every single night. I remember from a very young age being afraid that a man would sneak into my room from my window and sleep in my bed. This scared me so much that sometimes I would'nt even sleep for the whole night. I ended up sleeping with heavy things next to me in case something happened. Keep in mind I was probably about seven. Then my parents noticed I wasn't sleeping so they took me to a sleep study. (I never told then why) The sleep study showed nothing. However I was still not sleeping out of fear. Then my dad gave me melatonin one night, and there hasn't been a night where I haven't slept with it. I genuinely think that if I don't have it I will freak myself out and won't fall asleep. So for about 6 months the ""naked"" dreams went away, but I started getting new dreams, which still go own probably everyeek. My dreams vividly show a man chasing after me trying to do sexual things with him. Almost Everytime this happens I wake up for a few seconds screaming, but then go back to sleep. However one time I started cursing and screaming bloody murder and my parents came in. Ok so you're probably thinking ""oh this fifteen year old just has some mental problems and is scared to be sexually abused"" but I also have a history of false memories. I vividly remember something happening to me (nothing sexual), but my parents deny any of it and when they make fun of me for thinking that it happened I get these super vivid flashbacks of it happening. I'm convinced it was real but they deny it Everytime. Is it possible that my mind cleared out the memory that I was sexually abused like how it made the ""fake"" memory?",24Feb2019,0
