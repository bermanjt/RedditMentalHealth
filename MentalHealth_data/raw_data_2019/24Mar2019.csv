I’ve had a major anxiety disorder for years, like any particular situation could trigger a panic attack resulting in me throwing up. My parents new about it when it first started 10+ years ago but they never thought it was bad enough to seek outside help. If I told my parents I was having an episode the conversation would usually end with them telling me to control my breathing and power through it. Over time I became uncomfortable telling them about my situation because I felt like they wouldn’t accept how serious it is. It’s been so long no since I’ve told them about an episode that the think I’m cured. I’m now a junior in college and my symptoms are getting a lot worse. I constantly feel anxious like I’m on the verge of having a panic attack at any moment and it’s getting to be too much. I need help and I’m not comfortable asking for it especially from my parents. Anxiety has always hindered me leading a normal life an lately my mood has severely taken a hit as I watch everyone I know have happy healthy relationships and friendships. I’m scared that I’ll never have anything like that if I continue on this way. I’ve also noticed that I’ve stopped eating full meals regularly an am concerned that even though I’m aware of it it continues to happen. 

My family has good insurance, but I haven’t been to even a general practitioner for years. I feel like I can’t even talk to my parents about my mental health so even thinking about setting up an appointment to see some kind of doctor really freaks me out. 

Sorry for the rant but I think I really need help and I don’t know what to do.",24Mar2019,1
1,"I'm having a tough day. I've been working on my business taxes for over a week now, I can't afford to pay for someone to do it and it's really depressing me and giving me anxiety. I feel very overwhelmed. So, I turned to Reddit today to make me happy. Everyone keeps down voting some comments I made in a post making me even more bummed. I'm being stalked by someone on Reddit massaging me that I'm a whore and saying awful things. I'm thinking of deleting my account all together because it seems like the trolls and mean people have significantly increased in the last couple of months. My boyfriend is out of town, I haven't gotten more than four hours of sleep in the last week. I don't want to shower or do basic functions. 

Do any of you have a really nice movie that I can watch to make myself a little happier? ",24Mar2019,1

3,"hi i think i need some help.   for the past.   4/5 months(? time is really hard for me)  i have had (possibly) on and off psychotic symptoms that have affected my life a lot.

these include: completely withdrawing from my “friends”/isolating, disorganised thoughts /  repetitive thoughts, repeating the same thing outloud a lot or talking outloud to no one / myself / the sky (this is always embarrassing afterwards but at the time i can’t control it). 

delusions, (thinking everything is a gameshow or tv show that ppl offscreen are controlling / laughing about, that everyone is actually not real and i’m the only real person, that people are pretending to be people i know but are really imposters/fakes/implants, that lyrics in songs or things on shows or posters are put there directly for me and to impact my life / as a joke, thinking i’m in hell or that i’m going to be found by angels/god and taken back to hell) 

confusion, complete disassociation / depersonalisation or derealization (not recognising my appearance at all / my voice / my
body etc), amnesia (not always completely sometimes just very very very fuzzy recollections but some amnesia as well), speaking or thinking incoherently (afterwards realising this but at the time it makes sense)

hearing laughter or small things that aren’t there such as someone knocking, someone walking directly behind me, cars crashing outside my house, babies crying. smelling things that aren’t there such as orange cake (when there’s none in the house and i have been ill with the flu so i can’t smell anything anyways bc my sinuses are blocked) etc 

it’s worth mentioning i’ve been diagnosed with avpd, ocd and autism. so i thought at first isolation was avoidance, repetition and disorganised thoughts were from autism, and i thought the rest was me convincing myself / obsessesing over possibly having / developing  schizophrenia because my aunt had it badly and i think her sons did too (they killed themselves one at 14 and one into their middle 20s) and my uncle i think has it too (but we don’t talk to him anymore, the last time we did he wanted hair and blood samples mailed to him “because of the government” or smth weird)  on my dads side 

my mum has diagnosed bipolar type 2 though i’ve suspected she was misdiagnosed and actually had bpd for years 

i’m 21 this year and male 

i’ve been seeing a clinical psychologist for 7 years for major depression, panic disorder, social anxiety, ocd, avpd and cptsd. 

tldr: basically my question is, is it possible i am overthinking and overworrying about developing schizophrenia and overblowing small symptoms of my other mental illnesses or could i really be developing it? ",24Mar2019,1
4,"Throwaway account. Just want to say some stuff.

I'm 19 now and I've had some troubles in my family since 13ish.

I had a breakdown at 16 and I straight up refused to go to school. I only have really basic qualifications because of this and I absolutely fucking loathe myself for making such a stupid decision. 
My parents would scream at me every day asking why I wouldn't go to school and I honestly don't even have a proper valid reason. I couldn't get past the door of the house even though I wasn't really bullied or anything at school. 
I went to the doctors once but they passed me onto the school councillor who I couldn't make myself see. 

I am my own worst enemy. I do fuck all around the house just to get my parents to yell at me. I hate it but I don't stop?? I just want to waste away in my room. 

I couldn't kill myself because I have a nephew and I don't want him to think that this is a good way out but I just want this all to end. I fucking hate myself.

I cant even go outside to walk the dog any more because I live in a rural community and I'm so sure that everyone is judging me and talking about me.

9,"okay so this might be long, i just need to let everything out.

so hi ive been extremely depressed for as long as i can remember. i lived in a house with my parents for a while, but they were addicted to drugs. all kinds actually, but mostly pills and heroin. i used to have to watch my dad shoot up in the car in a random parking lot. my mom also went through chemotherapy when i was realllllly young. and unfortunately, she passed away when i was 10. she had a blood clot in her lungs. during that time, i had a horrible eating disorder where i threw up everything. i couldn’t keep anything down, but, i was also bullied a lot. i had barely any friends and the ones i did they could never understand what was going on. my friends were a girl younger than me and (at the time) a guy who was 5 years older than me. but moving on from me being 10. last summer i was sexually assaulted, twice. one 17 year old and the other was 15/16. one guy did it at my best friend house and the other did it in a mental hospital, a MENTAL HOSPITAL. ive never felt comfortable with my body after that. keep in mind, i was only 13. after a long time of recovering, me and my boyfriend broke up. and that broke me, and it happened because his mom didnt like me. then i started to guy hop, getting used by everyone. and now the present, im 14. i have gender dysphoria and an eating disorder (again). i also have bipolar depression, anxiety, and a slight bpd. and i have been cutting myself. it hurts so bad but i dont know how to stop",24Mar2019,3

Hey reddit.

I'll spare you the ""my childhood was bad"" story and give you a brief rundown of my life;

* Dad goes to jail at 2
* Dad comes back at 6, leaves until 11
* Dad comes back at the age of 12 for 2 years, and then separates from my mom talking my eldest sister with him.
* From 14 - 16, my mom, two little sisters (10, and 4) are homeless, in and out of shelters and charity ran hotel rooms.
* Mom overdoses at 16, sisters move to newfoundland with retired grandparents, I stay in ontario (homeless) so I can get an education. \*My mom survived, but she went to jail shortly after for multiple drug possession charges
* Graduate highschool in 2018, was living in a community ran youth homeless shelter, was actually pretty nice all things considered. Suburban ontario, so there was always food and clothes and warmth.
* Saved enough money in highschool to live on residence during college
* Here I am now

I don't have very much friends. It was kind of hard to make friends in highschool. I didn't relate to anyone at all, and everyone seemed to not want to talk to me after telling them I was in a homeless shelter. This only escalated in college. I've made one good friend, and I'm very thankful to him for being so kind for no reason at all. Lately I've been feeling really alone. All my life it's been me and my sisters against the world. Although my mom has been there physically, she's never been there mentally, and ironically most of my childhood trauma comes from her abuse. I've been the role model to my little sisters because my eldest sister was always out with friends. I wouldn't leave the house if my sisters where there because I was genuinely worried for the safety of my sisters, and this kind of mindset fucks with someone mentally like you wouldn't understand.

I've always understood suicide. I've had suicidal tendencies in the past, but not like the past few times.

Lately when I think about suicide it's been a relieving feeling, my life feels like it's not going to get any better, and the more I become aware of this, the more worried I get. My first youngest sister (13) just started smoking, and I feel 100% to blame for this. Like I said earlier, I treated my sisters as my own children, I would brush their hair for school, get their clothes ready, make their lunches etc because my mom was always either shooting oxy in her arm, or smoking crack using the sink filter as a pipe filter.

I don't know what to make of this, I've been breaking down in tears randomly for the past few weeks (had a few outbursts writing this).

I'm also going to mention that I have severe social anxiety, so the thought of going to the doctors to tell them whats going on almost gives me a panic attack.",24Mar2019,9

Sometimes I have sadness, but that’s usually at certain times of the year (winter) and when I’m stressed. I’m in therapy and I’m taking medication for my anxiety (buspirone).

13,"Yesterday, I was reading a tragic story about a man who killed his mom. The story said that he was suicidal afterwards, and I thought that if I ever did an act like that, not that I ever would, that I would be suicidal also. Later that day, me and my family has a disagreement. I then thought back on that story, and of course the disagreement would not cause me to do anything like that, but then a voice in my head said that I should harm myself, since I made anyone angry. Of course, I thought that that was ridiculous, since having an argument and murder are two completely different things. Now I'm worried that something like that might happen again to me. I love life and would never want to commit suicide, but I am worried that something like that might happen again.",24Mar2019,1

My partner only has casual work and I work a low paying full time job, we simply can't afford 200 per week on top of rent and bills.

suddenly, he turned into my worst nightmare. he shit talks me to mutual friends, has done things that make me want to vomit, and somehow, i miss him deep down. it wasn’t a good relationship mentally for the both of us. there were so many good times, but so many bad times to the point where i was crying almost every day.

18,"I’m sorry if this isn’t the right sub , I tried /sociopath and I got no replies on there probably because of all the sociopaths on there 😟

I was with my ex 6 months, I’ll try to write this fast 
1. After he hurt my feelings and he could see me cry in person or over the phone, he never felt any remorse or guilt. It would be ‘Are you starting yourself if you are I’m going out’ then I’d have no choice but to stop crying or there would be concequences. Or I’d be called a drama queen 

2. I have asked him about feeling emotions, and he told me that he’s not a emotional person

3. I have never seen him sad,scared, anxious, or any normal emotion, the only one I seen was neutral, happy, he would hardly really get angry if he did he just walked away.

4. He lied to me a lot. About big things and also about tiny things that didn’t even needed to be lied about

5. I never felt loved or wanted, or a fear of loosing me, if I threatened to break up if he made me mad, I will loose, he will just tell me to f*** off and break up with me 

6. He is very physically cold, doesn’t like to kiss and cuddle 

7. He would let me down a lot with dates we had planned, he would always be late, sometimes I would go to his house and he would go somewhere and leave me there for 2 hours 

8. After hurting my feelings he could never apologise, he never felt sorry and guilty about hurting me so he probably didn’t understand the point. I would have to force him to say sorry 

9. Lots of arguments on my side because of his actions, relationship was very dramatic, only thing I can describe it to would probably Harley and the joker. 

10. He liked spending my money

These are obviously all the bad things, yes he does have positive aspects which I why I liked him but I’m not going to bother listing them. 

I did care for him, he tried to contact me and said he wants to get back together, but I’m perplexed, why would someone who never loved me want to be with me again. He did say he misses me. Btw this is after 6 months no contact 

I don’t know what to do, because if he’s a sociopath that’s not his fault , but it’s very stressful for me, what does he want with me like does he even care about me at all? I want to give him a chance but I’m probably going to just end up the same as round 1",24Mar2019,1

22,"I would like to preface this by saying that I have done a lot of research into this because I did not want to cause her of faking early stages of schizophrenia, while she does suffer from anxiety and has had experiences with self harm and has been to a physc facility in the past, however I’ve done as much digging into symptoms and how she behaves and what she tells me is completely different from how she actually acts, and how everyone else I’ve talked to says she acts; she never isolates her self, she makes friends incredibly easy, she is a much better reader than I am, she’s very expensive, and generally is an outgoing person, not at all the kind of person who suffers from schizophrenia. The main thing is that she claims to have hallucinations of voices that say incredibly cliche things like “kill” (we are both 15 btw if that is relevant.) the fact is she does not display any symptoms accept the hallucinations she claims to have, which she refuses to tell a physiatrist or doctor about. I do not know what to do but I can’t let this go on, stuff like this trivializes real cases and only continues the cycle of angsty teens wanting attention.

23,"I'm a first year in college and I was placed with my roommate randomly. We got along a lot better at the beginning of the year, but still pretty well now. That said, he has a lot of bad personality traits: he calls his female friends dumb bitches even when they  make their discomfort with being called that clear; he treats his mom like shit (screams at her for normal normal mistakes, refers to her as a dumb bitch), verbally abused one of my suite mates and tried to pass it off as him helping him get his shit in order, etc. He's constantly complaining, and whining, and calling everyone else stupid...it's extremely abrasive to be around.

Early on he warned me he struggled with bipolar disorder and had panic attacks so I was prepared if they happened during the year. First semester it didn't seem like he had any issues, but second semester he told me he had had lots of suicidal thoughts during high school and this semester he's had more panic attacks and anxiety. He once told me that a night where I thought he was just doing work on his laptop he was actually writing a suicide note (although he said it helps him vent and calm down). Since then I've been worried I might come back and find him harming himself.

Another issue is his drinking. He never drinks to get buzzed: only to get drunk. Once he's drunk his behavior is just dangerous. He's stumbled into the room looking for more alcohol, will pour himself huge glasses of mixed drink , and doesn't seem to know when to stop. He recently bought everclear which is 90% alcohol, and has been proposing adding it to drinks which is super dangerous with that alchol content. One time he forced his friend to take a shot of it even though he didn't want to. He's also forced or really pushed us to drink more when we don't want to. He also told me that he had bought cocaine, which I told him he should get rid of, although I have no idea if he still has it.

Last night he added everclear to one of my friend's drinks and didn't tell him about it until afterwards. He also ""joked ""about putting a tylenol in his drink which we all took super seriously and angrily told him he should never do. Later last night he also stormed out of a friend's dorm for no reason and texted me later that he didn't want to talk to me or my suite mate again for the rest of the semester, even though we hasn't done anything. He explained today that it was because I was joking back and forth with my suite mate and he felt left out of the conversation, and his anxiety blew it out of proportion to where he thought we hated him. On top of everything, he has a huge crush on said suite mate and is constantly theorizing on whether or said suite mate is queer too. For that reason he especially cares what this suite mate thinks of him.

My problem is this: clearly he has a lot of issues, which I understand, but I can't bring myself to be totally honest with him and neither can my suite mates. We have all agreed that he has a bad relationship with alcohol and decided we wouldn't drink with him for the foreseeable future. However, I'm afraid all of us confronting him because I don't think he can take it. Just talking him earlier about last night, I could tell he was on the edge of an anxiety attack because he was worried about talking to the suite mate he has a crush on and who 's drink he added everclear to. He's drinking again tonight and is hoping that the dunkeness will make it easier. I can't be honest with him, and I have to continue putting up with this because I live in a double with him. It's toxic for me. It stresses me out and it feels like I'm stuck.

27,"I'm gonna try and keep this as simple as possible to spare some details and make a clear and understandable post. So my aunt living in the same home had a mental illness. From what I remember it started about 10 yrs ago when she said she started seeing faces and demons in the reflection of things like TV, window mirror ect. So she moved back to my grandmas house where we all stay now. 

Back then it wasn't very apparent as it seemed she had it under 'control'. Fast forward to now her mental illness has deteriorated her as a person and seems like she cant tell the difference between delusion and reality. Basically she will have episodes every once and a while where shes just crying in agony and she keeps on saying someone is shooting air at her and she thinks someone is releasing some sort of bad energy at her and shes begging them to stop and reveal who they are. Theres more things I could go into but I'll spare it.

The family used to just bear it and we just wouldnt get a night of sleep but now it's getting bad. I've always said she needs to get some help but my grandma would defend her because, you know family can be like that. But now my grandma cant take it anymore and hence is why I'm here seeking help. 

So my aunt is not willing to seek help and I was wondering what I can do to get out of this pickle so to speak. I've googled some resource centers and tried teaching out but as I write this it's the weekend so I have to wait til Monday.

33,"So the list begins with me being a 6 year old boy ...

The typical day begins with my being with-held food at the morning, with my mom refusing to cook me food until dinner time. So the wait begins, as I am locked in my room, blocked from the Internet, with-held from making friends, and forced to go to a stupid charter school where practically no one is allowed to make friends. This continued on throughout my 6 year old life. Whenever I DID TALK TO MY PARENTS, it was usually my alcoholic father beating up my mom or hitting and screaming at me. Then comes the later years... (oh great, hopefully it changes, right?) Also, being severely underweight for my age was a big plus!

I am screamed at every single day by my alcoholic, violent father who is worthy of Stone Cold Steve Austin levels of asshole. Some days I would get my 7-14 year old frail body beat up by my own father. If that didn't happen, they sent me to martial arts classes to get beat up by a professional. Despite breaking my arm, back, and suffering loads of bruises and cuts, my parents still forced my young self to martial arts right after school while screaming at me on the way there. Thanks mom and dad. You are worthy of getting arrested. (Oh yeah, what's a doctor? Do those exist at that point? Maybe my parents know someone who can, I don't know, fix my broken arm)

Come my 11-14 year old years, and I was ignored for the most basic of needs: attention, food, water, clothing, human interaction. My parents refused to buy me anything, feed me once a day, locked me in my room, yelled at me whenever I asked to see the light of day, and tortured me my mocking, mimicking, yelling, hitting, sending me to martial arts school (where the culture was alike to Neo-Sparta), telling me to clean the bathrooms, berating me for anything, calling me retarded, buying me clothes and then proceeding to tell me that I look like a homeless person (they bought me the only few clothes I have), and outright refusing any human decency in my life. Thanks mom and dad.

This pattern of emotional and literally physical attacks continued on throughout my life. I am 19 soon to be 20 now and I am locked in my room by my own parents. Except I have Internet now. For most of the my life, my parents locked me in my room and did not even allow me to go outside other than to go to school, where-in I was locked in a fascist-Neo-dictatorial charter school where saying ""Hello"" would render you in detention for 2 hours. Thanks mom and dad. That school was utterly useless, providing only the bare minimum of course load (English, low-level math). Also, thanks to my aunts and uncles, who unanimously agreed that everything in my life is my fault and that I should have owned up to it: I was kicked out of my house and left homeless for weeks at a time.

I made it into college, and I ended up with the most horrible people I have ever met (except my parents, brother, and father). They constantly raided my things, attacked me, yelled at me, woke me up at night every time I went to sleep, and basically were a lesser version of the assholes my parents were. They did a whole lot of other stuff.

I began suffering from a multitude of mental and physical health issues due to a lifetime of concussions, lacerations, arm-breaks, bone-breaks, mental abuse. One day, I couldn't take it anymore and started yelling, to which my parents threatened me with a knife. I ran away from home and called 911.

To my surprise, the police turned on me, saying that I was mentally retarded and sent me to a mental institution for 2 weeks, to which, to my surprise, the caretakers and people there were also My Parents 3.0 Reloaded. The police officers did not bother to think about what I was saying, and simply went straight to pen and paper to jot down the words ""autistic, needs help, mental hospital...""

The mental institution forced me to take medication, sat me for 2-3 hour sessions stating how mentally retarded I am and that I needed to take the medication or I wouldn't be released (by the way, the medication had horrible side effects.

They sent me to my primary hospital, to which the primary hospital also unanimously agreed with the police &amp; my parents that I needed mental help, except that their form of mental help was superficial therapy, 3000$+ dollars worth of treatment at a time, the acknowledgement that I am indeed mentally retarded to think that a physical threat on my life is something that is TO BE CONCERNED OF.

Previously, when I was on medication, my parents turned on me once again, and shoved pills down my throat ""because it was good for me"". Currently on break from university, after suffering bouts of nightmares, extreme physical pain, and being financially withdrawn by my own parents, I am planning on working in fast food for years just to have my own place where I won't be treated lower than an animal.

Currently, my parents continue to treat me like a dog, waking me up in the middle of the night whenever I go to sleep, with-holding food from me, yelling at me, refusing to listen to anything I say, father physically threatens me for whatever I do, continues to berate me, is the biggest pussy I have ever met (would do something horrible, and literally run away in his car). Oh yeah, and any family member KNOWS of the horrible sub-animal treatment I am going through, and refuses to acknowledge my existence. So yeah, thanks world.

So yeah, if you have any advice (other than calling 911, who are completely fucking useless and only want to send me to am mental hospital again, and other than reaching out to ""supposed relatives who can help me at all"", or ""start working"", which I am going to start working) to deal with my extreme physical ailments, mental abuse, and neo-Nazi-Spartan household living conditions, it would be a great help, since apparently even the cops won't help me.

TL;DR: My family are made up of horrible people. I was physically and mentally abused for 19 years and continue to receive more and more physical ailments due to worsening conditions. My father is a violent alcoholic who continues to hit and yell at me. My mother treats me less than an animal and refused to give me food when I was young. My brother steals from me and hits me as well. My extended family refuse to acknowledge me. The police, hospital, and mental institutions all acknowledge me as mentally retarded for looking after my own health after a physical threat with a weapon and seek to force treatment onto me. I am in financial, physical, and mental crisis. Therapy is superficial and there are not many options. If you have any shred of humanity, please help.",24Mar2019,0

I often get a feeling like outside things - music, tv, people talking - is overwhelming and a bit too much, because my imagination or the narration in my head is already taking up 99% of the focus. Anything coming from outside is just interruption. Things like music sound very, very loud. I startle easily when I'm like this. I'm not able to silence thoughts. Best is to sit quiet and sometimes (when no one's looking, because it's weird, I know) react to the thoughts with expression and sometimes gesture until they can be put aside again and I can put the outside thing in front of them. It feels completely pointless to do anything like watch a movie when I'm like this, it's like there are two movies playing at once.

We both have infertility and have gone through years of treatments and tens of thousands of dollars to have 2 kids. My wife has been depressed and had anxiety for years and seeing a therapist.

I'm looking for any answers or similar experiences. My Grandmother just passed away on my mother's side, my mother has been gone for about 8 years so I can't hear her thoughts on the subject, but maybe someone else could fill in some blanks? 

My Grandmother came from a very poor family with 8 kids, from what I understand, they grew up hearing their drunken father sexually assault their mother, he molested all of his daughters and beat his wife and children. They lived in an absolute nightmare. 

When my Grandma got married to my Grandfather she seemed to have come out of that situation being able to function, love and have a normal life and they loved each other very much, she had a son, my uncle and then a daughter about a year later and that's when the problems started, she didn't bond with my mother, she was a sick baby that cried all the time and couldn't gain weight, I'm wondering if she suffered a mental breakdown or some sort of PPD or psychosis, if you look at her pictures of when my mom was about 3, My Grandmas eyes are unfocused or almost looking in different directions, she looks like a totally different person. 

My mother ended up being molested by her brother for years, and we suspect maybe my grandmother molested my uncle because they grew up very secluded and don't think my uncle's behaviors came out of no where, but it's never been confirmed. My mother begged her parents to help her and told her what was going on but they didn't do anything to stop it. My Grandmother became a hypochondriac, had delusion's if she thought something in her mind, it became the truth. 

My mother was the kindest person I've ever known and suffered with crippling depression her entire life and I have always been resentful of my Grandmother for how my mother was treated. 

With her death I feel like there may have been undiagnosed mental illness that may have caused a lot of these behaviors, does anyone know anything about mental breakdowns being left untreated or maybe even postpartum psychosis? 

Any thoughts would be welcomed!

41,"I am 16F who lately has had concerns that I may have a mental illness relating to sensitivity of sounds. Before I go any further, if what I mention is in fact perfectly within the range of normal then please tell me and I will be on my way. In the event that does happen please know that I am sorry for wasting your time and that I have issues with \[minor\] hypochondria. 

&amp;#x200B;

I fist started suspecting that I may have an issue (that should be looked into) when I came across an old photo of me when I was about 5-7, of me crying hysterically and my mom smiling as she covered my ears. I thought of it as rather funny and adorable (still do), but couldn't remember the context. So I asked my mom and she said that we were in a room full of other family members just talking amongst each other and next things she knows I'm balling my eyes out, so she covered my ears while she and my brother laughed. Upon hearing the story, I remember the event more vividly and others like it and I realized why I was so upset: I couldn't stand listening to a room of people talking.

&amp;#x200B;

After this I began to become more aware of just how much some sounds/noises have bothered me; whenever I'm in class   where no one is talking and all I can hear is either the clock ticking or people typing, I get really angry and can't focus, so much so that I want to yell at everyone to shut the f\*ck up. I'll usually calm myself down once I begin typing myself. There's other examples too, but I briefly summarize them as I feel as though I've written a lot already:

* I have a friend who likes to hum a lot, whenever she does I want to push her off her chair or tell her to shut up. Unfortunately I have a tendency to put up with it because I fear she'd feel insulted, plus she either forgets or doesn't listen.
* I *really* don't like using airplane bathrooms due to the noise the toilets make when they flush. I gotten better accustomed to it now then when I was little, but still after I finish I'll be sure to close the top, unlock/open the lavatory door, then as quickly as I can press the button that flushes and GTFO so I will hear as little of the flushing as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

I've to discuss this (will again tomorrow) and other concerns with my parents, and although they are very loving and I can tell they're well-meaning, they just tend to almost..disregard my concerns and undermine them and tell me the oh so classic ""you're fine."" Both of them have also told me that one does not need to see a doctor for ""every little thing."" My mom also has told me whenever we talk about my mental health that she isn't very comfortable with me having a file with my school's counsellor because she doesn't want me to be ""labelled."" I believe this stems from stigma regarding mental illness, so I also try to reassure her that it is only a big a deal as we make it.

&amp;#x200B;

after i went to college and he got help we reconnected and begun to fall for each other again. this time, my EDNOS (which developed along w my depression) started to flair up again and being in college only helped it, and he told me he would leave me if i could get help. so he left. we remained friends, but i always resented him for that. so one night i drunk texted him and then deleted him off my snapchat, he told me i was crazy. we haven’t spoken since. i’ve been home from college for the week and had to see him at a friends party, him and his new gf. does being jealous make me a bad person? or am i just jealous bc im unlovable bc of my dumb brain?",24Mar2019,2

46,"Soo.. I have a very weird question that I’ll ask but for you to understand the question I’ll gibe you a backstory first.

I am a very anxious person by nature and I am aware of that. However, at the high school I believed I started developing anxiety. 
I have a very intense fear of failure and how people I love think of me as. At the start of high school when school started getting hard and I started getting lower grades I started to have panic attacks about exams and how to tell my family about my bad grades. 

During this time my parents noticed the panic attacks and contacted my school where they did some tests with me (one of them was where they asked me some questions and I put my finger on something apparently the colour changed if I was anxious). School counselors don’t have a right to diagnose someone but they flagged me as a high risk student so they would monitor me.

A year or so later I got into a relationship (not romantic or sexual it was supposed to be a friendship) which was emotionally abusive for me and when I left that relationship I was left with no friends because the person lied about me to the whole school. I felt worthless and started to develop social anxiety as well.

I then generalized those feeling to things other things in my life. I tried to spend as little money as possible and had panic attacks when I spent money because I felt unworthy and I thought my parents would love me more if I spent less money. For this reason I never went to the counselor because I was afraid they would call my parents and I thought they would hate me for being like this and I didn’t want them to take me to a psychologist because it would cost money.

In my last year at high school I had a couple of friends (it was 2 years after the incident) and one of my friends noticed the signs and told the counselor at our school. With her help and my psychology teachers’ help, I am not in a much better place mentally. I still have panic attacks now and then but they are not frequent as they were and they are not as intense. I still get uncomfortable when spending money or when in a social situation but I can act in a normal way and not lose my shit. However, I noticed that my body is still reacting the same as before. My teachers tought me how to calm my breathing and control it but I notice that when in these situations my immunity starts to go down,  my muscles start to contract, and I get nauseous or acid reflux. I end up getting sick very easily, having a sore throat and sore muscles for days afterwards. 
I thought all of this would go away when my mind was more relaxed? I don’t want to go to a therapist, I don’t think my situation is that sever and I don’t think they can help me because my mind is calm most of the time. I don’t want to take medicine because again my mind is calm and also the responsibility of taking medication every day and the thought people finding about it (I am normally vocal about my struggles here in uni but the thought of people from back home knowing about them terrifies me) makes me more anxious.

Does anybody here have the same struggles? Does anyone have any recommendations?",24Mar2019,1

I shouldn't have left. but in some ways leaving helped me at first, because I wasn't being forced to confront my darkest truths on a weekly basis anymore lol. I guess I could be doing a lot better now if I had stayed, but at the time it just seemed so painful and embarrassing. Does anyone actually have...g o o d therapy sessions?

52,"Firstly I need to state I don't have any mental health issues that I'm aware of, and I'm not on any medication that could cause hallucinations.

Recently, the past 3 months, I've gradually started mildly hallucinating. It started with simple things like thinking I'd heard stuff like a door opening or someone shouting my name which I put down to just being mistaken.

As time has gone on these auditory hallucinations have progressed into much more pronounced things. Hearing conversations happening out of sight, then when I go to investigate, nobody is there. Or hearing my alarm on my phone go off when it is not set. Up until this morning, these auditory hallucinations would stop when the visual cues that typically accompany them weren't seen upon me investigating the noise.

For the first time ever this morning however, this wasn't the case. I do not have to be up for work on a Sunday until half past 5 and set an alarm for this. At 3am I was woken by the sound of my alarm. Seeing it was still completely black outside I was confused. So I checked my phone. It was 3am, my alarm was not ringing. There was nothing on my screen to say it was, and my phone was not vibrating. But I could still hear it plain as day for several minutes until it suddenly stopped. I know it was not actually ringing as it did not wake up anybody else in my house.

I have also had increasingly more vivid visual hallucinations. For example I will occasionally see animals in unusual locations where they should not be, and upon a second look they will not be there. I have also hallucinated people, originally the hallucinations were obvious as just that as they'd be featureless, however as of late a few of them have not been featureless and have made me think somewhere was there when there isn't. None of these visual hallucinations have persisted upon me looking directly at them as of yet.

I would seek a doctor about this but mental health is severely underfunded where I live and it would likely take me many months or even years before I'd even get to see an assessor.

So I would like to know if anybody else has experienced this or might have any idea why this has started on so suddenly with seemingly no trigger of any note?

54,"I had my mental abilities assessed, and most things were normal except my processing speed (which scored borderline). 

Ive always known something was off, so I dont know why learning this is upsetting. I was put on ADHD medication for ADHD-PI, and it helped for 6 months, but lost its effectiveness. I could go up in dosage, but it already makes me prehypertensive, and Im just not sure that I wanna go down that road of having to get higher and higher doses to feel any benefit.

 Ive been trying a more natural route of making sure I was taking my supplements like b12, choline, magnesium, curcumin.. I get a slight decrease in anxiety, but I cant say it helps my hypoactive brain.

Taking medication and feeling normal for a short time just made it easier to put into words just how I'm struggling.

I feel completely locked away. My eyes dont process my surroundings well, so everything looks flat as if one is staring off into space. Knowledge that I have is difficult to access and ruminate over to solve problems. I get back fragments of what I actually know, so my answers are also fragmented. This makes it hard to learn.

 Conversations are hard to do because a) Im not fast enough to process and respond and b) when I can respond, its a far cry from what Im actually capable of saying, if I just had the time or processing speed. It causes social anxiety. 

Im better off just listening and saying something generic every now and then like ""Oh, I see."" or ""Huh, thats pretty cool.""  to hide the fact that I cant keep up. And who needs to make new friends anyway?   Theyll never stick around to see the real me. 

 It feels like everyone else has an unlocked mind and there are multiple locked doors in my mind I have to bust through to get to that thing I really need right now. 

On bad days, I feel locked away from my personality,  emotions, and my connections on top of being locked away from my knowledge and physical surroundings, so it feels like I have no where to exist. I cant exist in the real world because I cant fully realize it. I cant withdraw and exist inside myself because the things that make me me are sealed away. I can only see and feel approximations that arent detailed enough to be of any use. 

All I can do is cry out of frustration, as I pound on and scream at my brain to DO SOMETHING FOR PETES SAKE. Feel something! EXECUTE MY COMMANDS! Why arent you fetching?! FETCH! Look! Why arent you looking?! 

I just dunno what to do now. Id like to go to therapy but I cant afford it anymore. I lost a job opportunity for a few months and just got another one, so itll be a while.  Im scared to death of losing this job because I'm too slow.

55,"Hello there I was prescribed this medication for complex partial seizures but no abnormalities was found on 2 EEG’s. One was for a hour the second was for 3 days. 

I decided to get off of it. Before doing so I gave the neurologist’s office more then a few calls on different days, left a message and have yet to hear from them. 

I just noticed a dramatic change in my personality. It wasn’t really a bad change though. I became more outgoing basically. But just a bit too much. 

I haven’t taken the medication for about 6 days. I been sleeping a whole lot, sometimes 3x a day. I’ve also been eating more then I usually do. 

So I’ve come here to see if anyone else on this medication went through similar things after stopping it. If you have, did you experience withdrawals and if so for how low long? 

By the way I was taking two tablets a day, 150MG. My next appointment is in a week. 

Thanks for taking the time to read.

56,"I was diagnosed as Asperger's syndrome when I was younger and then it got changed to Autistic spectrum disorder which really pissed me off because don't want to be in the same category as retards who can't speak or do simple maths.

Today I found out that the reason they got rid of aspgers syndrome is because in nazi Germany they would take they would kill the autistic kids and class them as ""untermench"" but the aspgers kids were valuable citizens due to their intelligence and ability to communicate. 

I know this isn't supposed to make me feel better about myself but it just does. Because my main fear was about being a second class human because of my diagnosis. But if the Nazis who kill anyone that could be seen as defective would have accepted me, it makes me accept myself alot more. It's just kind of a shame that I'm no ""autistic spectrum"" instead of Asperger's.

I have had depression for a very long time and only after my grades have died did my parents even bother to see a counselor to see if I was. And yes I was along with ADHD. 

I feel like such an asshole but, I feel like it didn't need to happen. I could have got help so much sooner. I could have been so much more prepared. Since 7th grade I have talked to my parents about my feelings and for so long they just made a joke out of it. 

It wasn't even just having to deal with my own pessimism, I had to deal with my parents nonstop insulting for so long.

Even after being diagnosed they tell me I have no reason and just don't give any fucks. My teachers give 0 fucks. 

And friends... I don't have those. Who wants to be friends with a self-pitying depressed middle school kid. In high school i'm just an idiot you don't want as a partner. 

I am a Depressed, Friendless high-schooler with a low GPA in a highly competitive area. 

Even more fun. I'm an Indian so parents homophobic, have no idea what non germ related illnesses are, came to US from India so they worked very hard and want that for me too. 

The only positive thing I can think of is that I know I will not kill myself because I am too scared of death and that there is nothing after this life.

58,"As long as I can remember, I've struggled with feeling safe with my own emotions. I'm pretty sure it all started with being emotionally neglected by both my parents. My reaction became to neglect my own emotions in addition to hiding them away from everybody else.

That if course made me a lot more invisible than I wanted to be and made me not end up with those friends I needed. So the spiral just continued.

I'm just turned 30 and the core of the problem is still the same. I've tried getting help through therapy for 9 years, but I've had bad luck finding and keeping a therapist who understands the severity of the problem.

The thing is, my entire life has always been and still is way off balance. I'm seriously under-performing and always has. Now recently I've started getting worse and worse panic whenever I'm alone and I'm getting more and more tired.

It also feels great to be able to help others and just be there to listen if need be.

Not sure if this is going to really be the right thread for this but here we go. My girlfriend has some extreme anxiety issues and has really bad depression. I don't fully understand all of her issues and sometimes they seem a little small for the reaction but again I don't fully understand but I don't need to as long as I'm there for her when she needs me. It has caused arguments between us and it's always going to but at the end of the day I still love her and always will.

Recently an incident at her workplace which is no fault of her own she has been suspended, this is as she puts it the only job she has ever been good at. This has knocked her down into a badly depressed state going from being busy 6 days a week to having to sit at home on her own all week without me . She isn't leaving the house and sometimes not waking up until night time. 

Now onto the big problem. So her cat went missing 2 days ago. She is a indoor cat. She may have escaped when taking bins out . It looks like she has scratched her collar off and because she is indoor I never thought I need to get her microchipped (yes I know I'm terrible) . Her cat is a way to keep her grounded and keep her going. When she feels down or depressed the cat is always there for comfort and there when I'm not. 

I'm about to go out and look for this cat. If the worst happens how am I supposed to go to the girl who is suspended and could loose her job and tell her that a week later something has happened to her cat. I genuinely fear that this will out her in such a state that I  cannot help. She has self harmed before and I don't want to leave her on her own. She has spend so long building herself up, gaining confidence and has made so much progress since I met her.

I have been randomly starting to cry when I am home, or just doing running around during the day and I can never stop it.  But then when I am at work or around people I know it is like a switch if flipped and I suppress everything and no one would have any idea I am constantly scared and alone.

83,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if this is the right sub to ask about it, frankly i'm at loss on what to do about this situation but any advice is welcome.

&amp;#x200B;

My nephew is 18 years old and for over 5 years now he has been behaving weirdly to a point it raises questions but i'm the only one in my family who dares to actually ask them.

&amp;#x200B;

He has had it rough in school since he's been bullied a lot and his parents were mostly not concerned about that for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed a lot of things i consider not normal about his behavior and i need to confirm them with other people if it matters :

&amp;#x200B;

\- He has ""ticks"" basically there happens times when he talks with his pillow or alone or just shakes in general when doing something alone

&amp;#x200B;

\- He cannot focus...on anything. If he watches a movie, he will not remember 90% of the details at the end nor even the actual story. This actually ruins him right now at school because his grades are horrible and he just lacks the will to study or even do anything related to school. When he actually tries, he fails to focus even against his will.  This happens also in conversations where he gets distracted in every single conversation and fails to hold one.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Now this is the point that scares me the most : he has liking for violent things. He constantly talks about terrorism, about how it's bad but mostly how it's violent how he watches videos of it and then talks about nazis and other stuff like that. He plays a lot of a game called Red Dead Redemption 2 where he only ever just kills people in it and proceeds to either torture them or hit them repeatidly for no reason while smiling like a maniac or bumping on his couch. Even though he assures me he understands it's just a game, he told me he dreams about it how good it is and that it's amazing how violent it is.

&amp;#x200B;

Now i don't know about you, but all those points i raised above really don't seem to me like a proper behavior for a 18 year old person. He has never done any harm to anyone and isn't a real problem child despite his catastrophic grades (he still listens to people and rarely says no) but on the other hand i still can't shake the feeling that later on he might have bigger issues...",24Mar2019,1

I just can't. I can toughen up and laugh at the pain, but I can't make myself not want to be in pain, if that makes sense?

I tried other psychologists and therapists, but they were either too expensive or too intimidating, especially when talking about suicide. I don't feel that any of them is supporting my views.

89,"Hello
I find it very difficult to ask for help or explain myself but ill have a go. Dont know if this is the right place to post this. Sorry if i go off topic


Bit of back ground im a uni student in england and while i love the subject of the coarse i am doing im having a lot of difficulties. I am very dyslexic so i knew i would struggle a bit but i didnt realise just how hard the work would be.


The problem i have is with over analysing everything. 

Its caused problems with making friends  I dont have any from my course cause on the first day i got invited to  a party and got way too drunk and ended up getting refused entry to a club and i was sick as well.
The friends i do have are awesome (most of the time). I met them all though my flatmates and i love spending time with them. The problem is that   i can't stop analysing everything that they say or do to try and find that hidden meaning or message even when i know that there isn't one. And when i can't find one i panic, i stop talking and i feel just terrible. My mind starts telling me stuff like, im a terrible frend, they dont what to be here,
Your Failing.
I have a problem with Failure, im obsessed with oviding it to the point where i compulsively correct my friends when they make a mistake with wording or stuff. And i know this is idiotic and dickish and ridiculously hypocritical cause i make mistakes while speaking all the time. Its just that i dont want them to fail , i want them to know for next time. Its idiotic cause they already know why am i pointing it out its already been logged.
The problem with failer ive had for a long time and its caused me no end of grief. Its effected my ability to ask people out even when ive been told by people around that person and by that person that they would jump at the chance (im not saying that every girl i come across wants to go out with me or that people are leading me on. This is a very specific set of people i am talking about and dont want to name thx for understanding) even in that situation i wont be able to ask them out cause im afraid of failing it hurts.

Its also effected my hobbies and jobs. I have been very sucsesfull at sports and have even won multiple, regonnal, national and international trophies. The problem is the more i won the more i ramped up the pressure on myself to win the next one, and when i didnt i lost it, but because i didnt want to seem like a sore looser i bottled those emotions inside. 

No matter the result i always butchered my performance and critically analysed everything i did that lead up to that result. I had a process that i went though where by i would separate what i thought where key moments into positive and negative. I would then sort though and figure out what i did wrong and how i could get a better result next time, finally i would pick out the key things i needed to work on for next time. Now analysing performance like this isn't a bad thing in fact i would say it was central to how i became so good at so many different sports. 

What is bad is when u start to analyse everything that your doing all the time. Its gotten to the point where i can't go to my fridge without being aware of weather im walking *properly* or not, am i swinging my arms too much, are my feet in time. I will also analyse everything other people are doing at the same time and will then try to interpret this and again try to find the hidden meanings and messages. Sometimes i won't do it in the moment but log it for later. It stops me from having a conversation with people cos im too busy figuring out what body position i need to have and still thinking about the phasing on that one sentence they said earlier in the conversation.   
At the end of the day i will put the day through the analysis process even when i dont want to and often i end up feeling overly negative and even when ive had a lovely day i will find the flaws. 
Its just not a healthy way of living your life and it really gives me trouble. I dont know if this is a problem or not i may just be over thinking things and being a bit melodramatic but whatever i needed to get this off my chest

I've not had the motivation to tidy my room in a couple years. I couldn't even see the floor. 

The landlord said she couldn't reschedule the electrician so the lads I live with offered to tidy quite a lot of my room for me while I was in work so it can be checked. I got home and I could see the floor for the first time in years. 

Seeing my floor for the first time made me want to tidy the rest of the room. It's mostly tidy now. I can see all my floor now and it smells nice. It's great to have my room looking this clean for once. ",24Mar2019,2

So I’ve never been an anxious person, I’ve always been laid back I don’t really care kind of person. I always get over things quickly. Last year, I smoked 10 times. About 5 times out of the 10, I noticed that my mind would race about nonsensical things, then I would enjoy the high. This all came crashing down on dec 26 when I was high for 4hrs and would not enjoy it. I was terrified.

About a week later I noticed these same thoughts would happen about 2 times out the week when trying to sleep. I felt 100% fine throughout the day however. Until Jan 29, I got stuck in a snow storm and had a panic attack. The next day I got an unprovoked one, and I haven’t felt the same since.

I felt anxiety when sleeping, racing thoughts, , and this tense feeling sometimes, mild disassociation. However, most of these symptoms have cleared up. I’m still having trouble sleeping at times. My thoughts are connected to randomness, and worried about my health I guess? 

Ive seen the psychiatrist, and after 100 questions, he thinks I don’t have panic disorder nor generalized anxiety disorder. He believes that the weed trip raised my anxiety level and made me more aware of thoughts I had before and didn’t pay attention to. He said it’s a phase that happens sometimes after a bad trip that could last for months.

They are as follows:
No remorse or guilt during lying

No problem getting out of relationships and friendships

Absolute lack of empathy when I get competitive

Like to be in control of situations and often get quite cocky

I have been told I can be quite charming and have good communication skills but obviously can't confirm myself.

So, bottom line, should I visit a psychologist to confirm my diagnosis.

104," 

Hello Everyone,

Background:

I (22M) was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 a few months ago, however, I have knowingly been experiencing symptoms since I was 18. Bipolar Disorder and other illnesses (Skizophernia, ADD, ADHD, Depression) run in my family, so my family and I knew what was going on, however, I was in denial and was always able to control myself to some extent, though when experiencing hypomania, I did a lot of risky things and even ended up in jail when I was 19.

Based on the past, I knew that every summer (around March or April) I would cycle into hypomania and have the ""good"" symptoms like grandiousity, inflated ego, hyperfocus, etc., but I would also become extremely sexually active, have a lot of trouble sleeping, and would start doing reckless things like breaking into abaondoned buildings, drinking heavily, shaving my head, etc. I would get ""itchy and warm"" spells where I felt so uncomfortable that I would have to go for runs and walks in the middle of the day no matter what I was doing. I even did this at 4 am a lot of times. I think my self awareness about what was going on helped me keep myself under control since I actively knew I was in a hypomanic episonde. Because of this, I would combat this sleeplessness by taking over the counter sleeping meds and melatonin, wear earplugs, etc. to help myself sleep during the summers when I couldn't, and I would isolate myself on days that I woke up so angry that I had a headache and could almost physically feel the anger. I started to wear bracelets and a ring so that when I was uncomfortable I had somthing to fidget with. In the long run, I think this was bad for me because I made it a habit of hiding my syptoms from people, so only people who were extremely close to me saw my meltdowns, though when they did, they almost always suggested I seek help. It wasn't until I was arrested that someone who wasn't close to me (a man that worked in the jail) recognized my symptoms and recommended I see someone.

Fast forward to today:

These past few months have been some of the hardest in my life. I began noticing symptoms of hypomania in late November/early December rather than in March/April, however, the symptoms progressed to a point where I wasn't able to control myself and I personally felt like I was going off the deep end, which is why I finally sought out help. It took me hours to fall asleep, and many nights I would be unable to fall asleep until around 4am, then be wide awake at 6am on the dot without setting an alarm or anything. I also suffered from paranoia and unrationalized fear in the evenings leading up to bed time. The anger and irratibilty caused many issues with friends, ended my two year long relationship, and I was actively skipping class and work to walk around and be active due to rushes of adrenaline that kept me feeling uncomfortable at all times (which I had never experienced before). On my way to school or work, I would miss turns and not realize I was going the wrong way until 5-8 blocks after I missed said turn. When walking to class, I would pass the building I was walking to, or I would go to work hours early instead of going to class because I forgot I had class. I was stopping at green lights and getting honked at. I was throwing things in the privacy of my bedroom out of unjustified anger. I was pacing the alley behind my house for hours a day. I couldn't focus in class and couldn't do homework because I constantly had a million thoughts in my head and it would take hours to solve one problem, or I would jump back and forth between different assignments and get nowhere on all of them. Though I didn't realize it, I have also been extremely sexually active since my relationship ended in December. I didn't realize/think about this until last week when I visited my pdoc for STI testing and started to think about all of the partners I had had.

The only thing that gave me any relief was to ""overstimulate"" myself by locking myself in my room and reading, dancing (I know it's silly), or playing video games while blasting music very loudly. Being both physically and mentally engaged and ""wearing myself out"" through physical activity helped, but I went to see my pdoc and started seeing a therapist.

My primary doctor put me on Lamotrigine/Lamictal (25mg twice a day). The first 3 days were amazing. I thought I was light headed when I woke up on the first morning, but after an hour or so I realized that my head felt physically lighter because I wasn't bombarded with thoughts. I felt happier than I had in a extremely long time, the adrenaline stopped, etc. I wondered if this was how other people felt all the time. After those initial days though, I noticed the thoughts coming back and started suffering from irratibility, but it wasn't nearly as bad as before. This lasted for 2-3 weeks. The past month or so, I've made it to back to where I started, and the medication seems like it is doing little to nothing (though I will admit that the adrenaline rushes haven't come back).

My primary increased my rx to 50mg per day, twice a day, but I'm still not feeling any different. My therapist has told me multiple times that I need to go to a phychiatrist, but the phychiatrist she recommended told me that my pdoc should handle it, and the other phychiatrsits I have called all have waiting lists 2-3 months long.

I have read that most people with BP2 suffer mostly from depression, but personally, I have only had one major depressive episode lasting around 6 months, and the hypomania is what really makes my day-to-day unbearable. I'm not sure if this is a legit thing or not, or whether maybe I'm suffering from somthing other than BP.

I'm really not sure what I should do to help myself, and from what I have read, it seems that Lamotrigine/Lamictal typically treats depression more effectively than mania. My academic performance this semester has been mediocre at best, and I'm most likely going to fail 2/4 of my classes this semester. I made it out of the job fair with multiple interviews (which never happened in the past) and now have two job offers, which I think was due to the fact that I have been in hypomania. Despite this, I am still struggling daily (especially at work) and I don't know what I should do.

Sorry for the long winded post, but if you've read it and can give any advice, I greatly appreciate it. Thank you. I posted in a much smaller sub dedicated to Bipolar Disorder, but didn't recieve any feedback :{",24Mar2019,1

109,"Yesterday i was at a bar and got into a talk with a girl. It was mostly casual talk until we started talking about memes. I mentioned that i really despise suicide memes because while i'm not suicidal i do struggle with a lot of bad emotions and lack of hope and i really get sick of living. Meanwhile most people i know that use suicide memes are perfectly stable people that pretend to be suicidal as a joke and it really pisses me off. From this moment the conversation got serious. We started talking about our lives and problems. This was the first time in my life that i showed someone my self harm scars on purpose. And this left me thinking. Am i an attetion seeker?

I know i always was like this since childhood, i was always very emotional and needed comfort from someone. Usually my parents. Sometimes someone else. I was pretty bad as child because of this since somewhere in the middle of primary school i became a massive snitch for a while. Thakfully i stopped this and now i'm really ashamed of it. I kept my need for venting under control till i finished high school when i got depressed about my life and the need came back.   Usually i only vent to my parents who are ok with it but a few times i did it with my friends when i got seriously drunk. A while ago i met a girl who actually encouraged me to do this cuz ""she's a psychologist she can help"". This ended so badly that i broke down emotionally for months and started venting to my parents, reddit, random people at a bar, counseling phones and a freaking priest (i actually reconverted from atheism to catholicism during this time ). And yeah i told this story to the girl in the bar just in a very short way and without the details. The best i acomplished was being able to talk about this in a calm way. And i never mention 

Worth mentioning is the fact that i always felt unapreciated since childhood for various reasons. I always was the worst kid in the family. My cousins and sisters were all rich and talented. I barely passed my classes and lived in an attic without even a fucking toilet. I had to shit into a bucket. I was always shitty at sports when 3/4 of my classmates are now bodybuilders. In high school people actually apreciated me. At least for a while because no matter what i did there was always someone who did it better and completely overshadowed me. I have barely any close friends since i went to college. Not even drinking buddies. My dating life doesn't exist. I barely get any matches on tinder and the ones i get just ghost me. Real girls barely talk to me. Of course i'm still a virgin. Nobody ever texts me. Nobody ever calls me. My friends from high school have forgotten about me. But i know that they still contact eachother. And it's not that they hate me or something. I'm just unimportant to them. I always have this feeling that people that i text to only respond out of courtesy. Espacially girls. I got ghosted so many times that i always expect this to happen any minute. My posts on instagram or facebook barely get any likes compared to my friends who get hundreds. Then comes my father who during high school crushed my self esteem completely. Never said a kind word about me and always criticised me. When i did something right he just raised the bar higher. Called me to help  him at work only to yell at me to get out. Then criticised me for not helping him. Don't get me wrong my father wasn't abusive or anything. He cared about me and we are still on good terms. He's just very insensitive and has a short temper. 

So overall take everything i wrote about myself add guilt over everything wrong that i did in my life(like being a snitch and more) and voila. You have my mental state. So i really want to know. Am i an attention seeker? Or maybe to make this a bit more precise. Do i need more attention then i have? Am i underapreciated? Because i propably am an attention seeker. I just want to know if this is a good thing or a bad thing?

With the way his insurance works we have to transfer him directly from the hospital to this next clinic, so we have to contact the next clinic and make sure they can accept his insurance(or we can afford the difference) and make sure they have an opening all before he is released.

Do any of you have any recommendations on a place for him to go? We are looking to keep him where family is which would be anywhere in California, New Orleans, Kansas City, or Chicago.

120,"I want to start this post off in May of 2018. I had family friends come over and visit, they live in the U.S.A and we live in Canada. When they were leaving I heard my mom say ""Next time you guys come and visit, we'll live closer so it won't be such a bad drive."" I was a bit confused by this statement and started connecting the dot. I realized that She probably meant that we were moving somewhere. I was a bit frustrated that she didn't tell me and this is how I was finding out. Fast forward an hour and my brother calls me into the living room. There my parents tell me we are moving to another town about an hour and a half away from were we lived. I was upset and didn't want to but my parents already made plans and had quit there jobs, to this day I've yet to get a good reason as to why we moved. I spent the rest of June dreading the move day I didn't want to leave, I didn't want to make new friends and be put in a new school. I was just sad for that whole month but I spent that month hanging out with my friends. The last day of school arrives it's report card pick up day, and unfortunately also moving day. I biked to school with some friends and was silent the way there and back. We stopped at an intersection and in front of us was a McDonald. They asked me if I wanted to chill for a bit but I didn't get too I had to go and start packing up, this hurt me way more than I thought it would, I biked away and felt like crying the way home. First day of summer was just terrible. 

We get to our new town and here we spend 3 weeks where one of my older brothers lives, he stayed with his gf because he was planning on moving in with her anyway. Those three weeks were some of the most boring times in my life. Finally we find a house its not great but its better than the cramped basement we were in before. The house is in the middle of a neighborhood there's not much around me but that wouldn't even matter anyways because I felt like shit and I didn't want to do anything anyways. I began Isolating myself in my room spent all day there just watching youtube and browsing reddit. My friends lived far I couldn't do anything with them anymore, my summer was just shit and I was unhappy. My parents desperately tried to get me outside of the house, inviting me places but I didn't want to do anything with them, I felt resentment to them, was I being unfair with the way I felt? August comes and the last week of summer my parents take me to buy my new school uniform and get me enrolled in my new school. I was still bitter so every car ride was just awkward silence. I told my mom I needed size 30 on the waist of the pants but she insisted that I get 26, not wanting to argue I let it happen. First day of school comes and my pants feel tight, I think back to the day we bought them and feel angry, I'm getting ready to leave and tell my mom that my pants feel tight and that it's her fault that they do, she was sad about it but understood that most of the anger was coming from the move and she tries to cheer me up, telling me to me to look at the silver linings. ""You're still alive and happy, you have a home you're healthy, you have a new uniform"" she told me. I'm sure she meant well and I should be grateful but that last bit stood out in my head. ""New uniform"" could she really not understand that that was something I hated, I despised it I didn't want a new uniform I wanted to be back near my friends, I wanted to be able to hang out with them but that's what she tells me ""new uniform."" Still angry about everything I get home and my parents for whatever reason expected me to be happy somehow. They can tell I'm still sad and they ask what happened and I say nothing. My parents are frustrated, and my mom begins yelling at me telling me I'm being uncooperative and unwilling to try and be happy. I ignored her but it did make me think, was she right am I being unfair? 

lets fast forward some more to February. I've calmed down a bit but remain unhappy. I spend my days doing the same things, wake up, go to school, go home, spend the rest of the day on my computer. I was tired of this routine I hated it. My parents hated it. During this time my dad had enough of me and the way I was acting. I started leaving a pile a clothes on my bed and just have it sit there for days, they were clean but I just felt no need to put them away, I wasn't going anywhere why did it matter, I never had friends over it doesn't matter. My mom was frustrated with this and told my dad that I wasn't putting away my clothing. I walk downstairs to get some water, my dad yells at me and tells me that I've become lazy and that I should get some friends (despite already having friends from school problem is I live about 20 min in car from them) he begins telling me I have changed for the worst and he blames electronics. This made me really angry, how could he be so oblivious to the way I felt, he blamed it on my computer rather than the fucking move, I couldn't believe it. I became really passive though and just didn't care how angry either of my parent got, so what if they did. What would happen, I'm already stuck at home doing nothing, I dont do shit all day and just didn't care if I got grounded. They caught on though and well my dad was angry but he stopped yelling at me and continued to tell me I was lazy and just glued to my electronics yet I stopped caring, my parents didn't care how I felt, why should I care about what they think? 

In general since the beginning of this year I've just been feeling like I'm losing motivation, I haven't felt truly happy since June 2018 and I'm not enjoying anything anymore, I no longer get enjoyment from the game I play or the shows I watched. My parents are still seem frustrated with the way I act and I don't feel like talking to anyone about how I feel. Recently I've started raging at the games I played never used to do this, I thrown my controller twice and have been feeling much more angry than ever, and just in general have just felt like shit.

I've made an alt account to post this. If you made it this far thank you for reading me vent.

121,"It feels like I’m broken beyond repair. I’m such an emotionally needy person, it’s like I need someone to be there for me every second of every day. I’m constantly wanting to tell people my problems and expecting them to be able to fix me, to make me better, to make me happy

I try to be kind. I try to be helpful. I try to make others happy and be generous with my friends and family, yet I constantly think they hate me. My friends, my parents, my siblings, strangers who have just met me, my best friend of 5 years who has been there for me through the toughest moments of my life.  I often think they all hate me and no one cares about me. I say something and they give an unenthusiastic response, they hate me. I send someone a text and they don’t read it for hours, they must hate me. 

I guess I’m used to be hated. My only friends in primary school more often than not bullied me. My only friends who lived near me also bullied me half the time. I said and did stupid and dumb things and ruined the first 16 years of my life. I made friends in high school but got ditched by them multiple times. One of them said they were annoyed with me for some reason. Another started spreading lies about me and laughing in my face about it

The thing is, I don’t blame people for hating me. Every time I speak to someone I feel like I’m annoying them, like I’m nothing but a nuisance, like things would be better in their life if I wasn’t there. Even if I’m trying to make them happy or have fun I am being an annoying piece of shit

123,"Hi everyone, I wasn’t sure where to say this so I went with the generic AskReddit. Firstly, sorry to disappoint, but I don’t believe I’m a real robot and I’m not crazy. At least I don’t think so. What this is about, however, is that I was raised by a slightly crazy narcissist. Sparing the long unnecessary detail, my father effectively raised me to be his wife/mother, in every way but sexually. I’ve been fucked up for many years because of this, partly because it took me so long to realize how twisted our relationship was- and that he should have been treating me much differently , etc. etc. 
While I’ve gotten out of that a while ago, I only recently have come to the realization/understanding that I, as a person, don’t know how to be self desiring, I want to help others, make them happy, do what they want. The most common example of this is that if I’m asked an opinion-based question, if I don’t have strong feelings about the issue, I choose the answer that I think the person asking wants to hear. As I’m sure you can imagine, that can make things difficult when I don’t actually want that thing, especially when it happens often and about more important things. 
So I’m torn. Half of me wants to take care of people and make them happy, and the other half of me suffers anxiety and depression trying to be autonomous and failing when I’m alone. I don’t have hobbies or strong likes anymore, and I struggle to find and hold onto those things. I feel like a robot, like I was put onto this earth only to make others happy, but I became sentient and despondent. Call me Melvin. 
But seriously, if anyone has thoughts or advice, if this is even read, well. I don’t know, I’m just confused, can’t afford counseling. Peace. ",24Mar2019,2
124,"Every Sunday. Its always Sundays. Always the evening. I just want to break down. I can't face another week of anxiety and blood tests and radiotherapy. I just want to be done. I'm so far away from the end. I'm going to start losing my hair soon. I just want to stop existing, because at this point, I'm only existing. I'm not living. I spend my week spending an entire day just driving to do five minutes of a treatment in an uncomfortable mask with the end so very far away.
Six weeks. It's only week three this week.

I thought three surgeries would've been enough at this point. My anxiety is never ending. I fear every time I wake up, in case I see my hair on the pillow. I want to go back to normality

125,"So I’ve been suffering from anxiety for years. Almost a year ago that anxiety turned to self hatred and depression and very quickly, suicidal thoughts.

To give context I live in a large city having moved here with my BF 3 years ago from my home country. It’s been hard as we’re perpetually broke, he travels all over the world so we’re apart a lot and I have no friends. 

I soon found myself in a scene involving meth and sex. Pretty quickly I began injecting but I did it with the intention to contract HIV and killing myself with diseases. My master plan was to contract HIV and any other infections. Leave my BF. Not take any treatment and die painfully of aids. Waiting back on the blood tests but I’m pretty sure my plan worked 50%. Finally last week I admitted everything to my family and my BF. 

I was packed on a plane and sent home to my folks who live in the middle of nowhere. I’ve been engaging with mental health services and drug addiction councellors since I’ve arrived but it feels the only thing anybody wants to discuss is the drug addiction. 

My family home has always been an unhappy place for me. It’s 15miles to the nearest town. I don’t drive. I only lived here from 14 as we lived in a large city before hand. I was bullied at school when I moved here and experienced a lot of violence at home. I had knives put to my neck/attacked with fire pokers/moved to a hotel for my safety all through my teenage years as my dad battled his own demons and alcoholism. Thing is returning here has brought back bigger demons I had buried. It’s just me/my parents/the cat and not a neighbour to be seen. 

I’ve been told I cannot move back with my BF until I recover, he doesn’t want to see me back for 6+ months. I know I can get over the addiction, however I don’t think my mental health will last that long. This house brings back scary thoughts and I feel terribly alone

Today I broke up with my BF after 5 years. I cannot have him sit and watch me deteriorate here over the phone. I’ve had to quit my job (which I loved and excelled at, only being offered a promotion 3/4 weeks ago) The thoughts of spending the future here has left me hopeless.

I’ve decided I need to do it alone. I need to find somewhere I can engage with MH and NA councillors in the country my folks live in and still try to hold on to my mental state. I’m planning on moving to a city a few hours away but I’m not sure if I even have the funds to do so. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t where to turn. I feel nobody is listening to me. The moment I asked for help was the moment I felt most alone. 

I don’t expect advice. I just hope someone will read this and say they’ve heard me. I’m writing this in tears.",24Mar2019,5
126,"Honestly not sure where I want to start, for the guts of maybe two years i’ve been really up and down in terms of feelings, always sort of had a ‘problem’ with mental health and i’m only now having the courage to talk about it, never had the guts to go to someone to talk face to face but i feel as if here would be good for advice. 

I could never really stem to where it began but i’ve always sort of had rocky friendships and been the one  everyone laughed at and took the piss with, but whether it was serious or not i never really could tell, i’ve always had anxiety especially in social situations and health wise, but recently in the last year it’s got a lot worse, I started talking to this girl and things got pretty serious but after a few months she started kissing other people and really fucked me over, but i kept going back and back as i’d never felt the way i did about anyone else and considered myself to have hit gold, or at least i thought i had at the start. I started to place all my eggs in one basket and didn’t hang about with my friends and devoted my time to her, i chose to ignore the signs of everything that i feared, losing her, eventually i lost good friends over her, friends of 7+ years and even to this day i’ve tarnished them and i know things will never be the same, some of them i still talk to but i know on the inside of it that things are still broken. I’ve just started Uni too and things haven’t really improved, i’ve just got absolutely no drive to want to work or go out and drink with friends, and i wouldn’t consider myself to have any reliable true friends, maybe one at a push, but it’s just all really dawned on me how far i’ve fallen into a dark hole and just lost interest in everything, on the surface i’ve just placed a fake smile and fake persona for everyone, just to seem normal but i know things aren’t, times just passing by and i’m watching everyone have the time of their lives whilst i’m just almost stuck, tied and it does feel almost like a drowning sensation. I’ve a few family members who are also getting older and have dementia etc and watching them fade away just bites at me too as i feel as if they’re becoming less and less themselves every time i see them and it breaks my heart, i’m not sure whether i’m just growing up and life is taking its course or whether there’s something else wrong with me, it’s such a hard situation to describe because one day i’ll genuinely be fine and joke but then there will be others and i’ll just be a completely different person and just not even want to exist, if anyone has any advice i’d really appreciate it as i just want to talk and change because ive just hit a low point and honestly don’t know what to do. thanks ",24Mar2019,2

I knew her before this for about two years, but have only recently gotten really close to her. The first thing that has been tearing at my mind is that they are a year older than me, and graduating this year. Essentially, this person who makes me so happy is going to be gone and I'm not upset that they're leaving (because they have a life to live) but am torn about how I'm going to cope with their absence. But even on a daily basis, they're constantly on my mind because of how happy they make me and how much they care about me, and it has gotten to an unhealthy level where I think of every action I do with them in mind to some regard. I do want to state that I'm not romantically interested in this person, but I think I'm emotionally dependent on this person in order for me to be happy. I guess the main point of this vent is trying to find a way to be happy without this person around and being ready to detach myself from them when the time comes without entirely breaking down.

It feels like my whole life is BDD. It’s very severe for me. I’ve done CBT, I go to support groups, and I try to do exposures as much as I can. When I went in for treatment, my psychiatrist said I was one of the more severe cases she’s seen because of how depressed and suicidal I was. I still am very depressed and am currently planning to end my life. 

Right now I work full time, I recently graduated from uni, and I am very active in life. I am one of those people who is seemingly doing great, AKA high functioning, but that doesn’t change the fact that my life is dominated by BDD and depression. 

Anyways, I’m not sure where I’m going with this. I just haven’t discussed my mental health enough. I can’t make it to support group enough.

I’m not even allowed to go to the bathroom on my own. There’s a shower curtain in there and the pole isn’t on magnets. If I was just allowed to be unsupervised I could do it. I have a bit of metal that’s pretty sharp. I could cut myself. If I was just allowed to be unsupervised. 

The exit is so close to me. If I sit at the end of my bed (that I’m stuck in day in and day out waiting to be free) I can see the exit sign. From there I could go to the elevator and be free.

Before this, he couldn't hold a job, couldn't drive, was forbidden to see a talk therapist (or do anything that would actually help improve his life), and was expected and forced to live the life of his religious father.

Through years of intense adversary, he has broken my parents down a bit and has been seeing a counselor, become more self aware, NEARLY ERASED HIS DRPD, is making leaps for his panic and anxiety, and finally realizing his goal of functioning on his own and breaking away from the negative grip of our parents.

144,"Hello everyone, just giving everyone here some details on myself and since when I have been feeling like this.

Since childhood I was always into gaming and never focused on studies. I failed my 12th exam and it had focused me to work really hard. I got into a relationship with my childhood love when I was in 12th. Not only did I crack my exams but I also got into the best engineering college in my state.

First year went really well for me but arround 2nd year I realized it was not something I wish to do. I had a fight with my gf where she said me that I had no goals. I really had no goals since I was not interested in what I was doing.

I started learning some skills I was intrested in, it was computer science related, after failing and passing my 12th exam, i wad not afraid of anything, 
I dropped out of college and became a freelancer and earned a lot more then my friends. Fast-forward 4 years later I have a small company of 4 people including me. I dont have problems in getting clients or anything but I have stopped in one place for a few years without too much growth. I feel afraid of expanding my company since i am lazy i don't want to take risks and i am in much better place then all my other friends. But that has stopped me from mentally moving forward at all. Rather then my skills i feel I am mentally blocked. 

In the mean time 2 years after opening my company my gf and I broke up. She was attempting civil servicr exams which she failed 2 years in a row and long distance relationship which had creatrd a huge gap between us. She left the exam and joint MBA and we are kind of in a complicated relationship after a 2 year break.

I was a very carefree perso  until i started freelancing and after that, it lit a flame of ambition in me. I am earning close to 4x of my dream job then but i am not happy with it at all.
I always keep dreaming of creating a multi million dollar company even though i am nowhere close to it. 

I buy cars, sports bikes etc but i don't feel happy with it at all. I am afraid that i will still be unhappy even after I achieve my dreams. I have been trying to learn some new technology over the last year but there was a barrier i just couldn't cross. And the barrier was mostly mental rather then me failing to understand the topic.

Then i ""got"" sick. A year ago i had a really bad moment, I was in a hospital all alone. No family no friends were there with me. I realized all that people always around me, were not friends at all. I felt completely lonely. I was lonely.
My Loneliness combined with all my mental health issues made me suicidal. I still am, just not so bad.

Today I realized im still lonely. I must say i deleted all my ""popular"" social media, I stopped talking with most of my ""friends"".

I do feel i need human contact, i want someone to rely on, or just talk and share things. But i don't know how. I'm shy, introverted and since my condition got worse... I'm more a loner. I don't really mind be like this, but I still feel lonely from time to time. I keep looking at making online friends.. And just the thought of being like I used to be.. Makes me feel empty. I don't know what to do",24Mar2019,1
147,"So I've been dealing with anxiety and depression for a while now. And the thing about my problem that's different from most is I recognize what causes it, loneliness and isolation. I'm 20 and got my own place a year ago, and live alone by choice. I also work at a factory where I'm listening to podcasts most of the day and don't truly connect with much people there. Just brief convos. I've dealt with anxiety my entire life but up until 8th grade I was okay, and was great in school and had a bright future. Then I had to move and start fresh at a new high school because of family health issues, and I got into the wrong crowd and start smoking and drinking a lot. The whole 9th grade was great, partying was fun and I felt like a new person. I was pretty much friends with everyone and got into a few relationships. Then starting that 9th grade summer I started getting full of myself. I could sugar coat it but I don't make excuses, I was acting like a scumbag. I got into a lot of trouble and did things I'm not proud of. Nothing crazy but still broke the law a couple times. Also started thinking I could take on the world which made a lot of people wanna start issues with me. I started gaining weight too and got self conscious about it and got bad acne. And you could say I started getting bullied, but I think I had to much pride at the same time and never really looked it at it that way. I responded to bullying with anger rather than becoming depressed, and that anger made me drink and then become impulsive to do dumb stuff. At the middle of 11th I had enough of everyone bothering me so I finished high school through a tutor and never went to a graduation. After graduating I had a year of living at my parents, working at a pizza shop and just partying with no direction. But then I got a landscaping job and learned work ethic, and I also started listening to Joe Rogans podcast. That podcast has changed my life in so many ways, through all the experts in various fields he has on I've learned a ton. I started running and eating healthy and I'm back at a healthy weight with clear skin. I've also humbled myself paying attention to martial arts. And mentally I'm the most comfortable with myself I've ever been. But I still find myself isolating. I lost or stopped talking to a lot of my friends from either them giving up on me when I was acting out (understandable) or me realizing they're a bad influence on me and holding me back from bettering myself. I can't bring myself to start a hobby like a martial art either too and I don't know why. I have nobody really to go with I guess. I find it harder to connect with people now when I used to be great at it. I'd connect with everyone, but maybe the pain from being abandoned by the people I cared most about has caused me too shut down. Idk. Sometimes I do force myself to hangout with a friend and I hangout with family (most of my family isn't around but only immediate family, I don't really have grandparents or anyone to talk too), but besides that I work, smoke, Netflix, sleep, repeat. I know I need to go out and make new friends and get hobbies but that social anxiety side of me stops me everytime. If anyone has any advice on how to break out of this rut id appreciate it..

148,"I'm 27M for context. Since I was a little kid, I've had a vivid imagination. I had a lot of Beanie Babies growing up in the 90s and I had a whole imaginary world for them with different backstories for each character. When I got a little older, I started writing fanfiction for Harry Potter. I was like 8 and it was obviously crap, and my mom and other family members wouldn't let me live it down. I learned very early in life that for whatever reason, I think a lot differently than most people, and I need to carefully consider my audience before I just write down all my emotions and the crazy shit I'm thinking about. I became hyper aware of how I'm perceived by people and made sure never to write anything down that contradicted my image. Writing gives me a lot of anxiety for this reason. 

I've been used to being a freak and being mocked or hated by everyone for a long time. I'm not a ""creative genius"" or anything of the sort, but I still think I can just create a video game from scratch and write a long branching story for it. I don't know to code or anything. This is the definition of an impossible ambition, but it's been in my thoughts for like six years.

I feel my imagination and writing habit gets me into more trouble than it's worth. I don't like to be hated, but I bring it on myself by posting satire and parody about things I don't like in a community, and then I get exposed and banned when people trace my IP.

I don't know if I'm a narcissist or what's wrong with me. A doctor said I don't have autism, but I take that with a grain of salt because he didn't actually evaluate me.

I want to move on and find a stable career and hobbies. I really need to grow up.",24Mar2019,1

Well this year overall I’d say that I’m less depressed and am capable of being genuinely happy! But I’ve noticed that on the weekends and nights that the work load has been light I just get extremely depressed and unmotivated to do anything.

155,"So I live in Uintah County in northern Utah. I've tried looking for help but there aren't many options that I'm aware of and I can't bring myself to just call around and ask them if they'll take me. 

Also, most of the resources I've found are costly, upwards of a hundred dollars and I haven't found anyone who specializes in BPD. I'm on disability and I can't afford that. I also have medicare a and b. I honestly don't know if that covers anything.

I'm still young but I was never taught this stuff. After a hospital stay I got into the system and I was kind of forgotten. It's as if when you become an adult you just aren't important. 

I want to become a productive part of society but it seems impossible. I barely have enough to live, I can't get mental help and work would be impossible. What, I freak out at work and lose my job? I stop going because it's a mental burden? I don't even have a car. I'm lost. Is there any way that y'all know of to find help? 

Short of trying to kill myself I don't know what to do. Even then I know they wouldn't do anything to help. The last time I was in the hospital they didn't do anything. A few of us there had attempted suicide and instead of getting help we were having ""classes"" about strokes and shit. Those are hardly the issue at hand. They just want to drug you and set you loose. ",24Mar2019,1
156,"My total lack of sex and the forbidden fruit of female companionship has taken a heavy mental toll in my post teenage and adult years. Things I picked up when I realized I was disposable and useless and unattractive to the opposite sex. After 24 years of never smoking, I took up smoking. I quit working out and put on 80lbs. I took up alcoholism. I seek out dangerous occupations and hobbies, like a dangerous sport of drag racing, and I currently work one of the most dangerous jobs in the country, truck driver. I haul HAZMAT loads on top of that, because frankly I don't really care that all these things are high risk compared to other things. Although I have enough self preservation to not try shooting up fentanyl laced heroin.

I just got so lonely, and felt so worthless and useless, that girls seem to really get revolted if I attempt to give them unwanted attention. I feel very disliked by women out there. I like to say ""I like women, but women SURE AS SHIT do not like me"".

Stories on tifu of casual sex, and people doing fun things with their girlfriends on reddit make me sad, depressed, jealous, all at once. I often say ""I wish I could find a girlfriend like you did, but that's not gonna fuckin' happen now is it?"" ",24Mar2019,1
157," 

During a recent stint in lovely Monroe County Jail in Rochester, NY the last couple of weeks, I was able to experience and observe some very interesting people and occurrences. Standard booking process when you are brought into holding is to segregate from the rest of the inmates until you are cleared medically and mentally. The gambit of loaded questions inquires if you are a threat to yourself, then you are ordered to let the nurse administer a tuberculosis test via subcutaneous injection; if it bubbles up within 12 hours, you are kept in segregation; otherwise placed in general population. As I was not supposed to stay more than one night in holding since they had no proof of a crime, I refused the test… not uncommon. Common however? Refusal means punishment. I was sent to AdSeg for the next 8 days. This section is used by MCJ as a sort of “sick bay” for inmates with colds, or apparently refusing unnecessary medical procedures, and suicide watch.

I was able to witness the JOKE that is Monroe County Mental Health Services. I listened to my neighbor’s sobs, the fear in their voice all day and night. I listened to a half dozen people request mental health to come talk to them because they were feeling sad that day, or their medication was late that morning and they were feeling the bad thoughts come back. The CO’s would mockingly ask “what’re you gonna do hurt yourself?” – If the person replied with anything other than a quick ‘nevermind’, the deputy would handcuff them and move them to a solitary cell, and now they have to sit in a quieter room alone with their already dangerous thoughts now amplified, instead of at least being able to make conversation or rap or pray through vents to fellow inmates.

One of the most terrifying things to have witnessed in my life was that of an individual named Dustin (or Destin? not sure), whose cell was kitty corner down the corridor. His was one of the isolation rooms that has the solid door with a tiny 4x4 window at eye level, and tray panel opening at hip level (for handcuffing and meals); versus mine which had more standard bars but covered in thick plexiglass, a tossing &amp; spitting preventative of the majority of fluids (ergo sick bay attempt) but is also effective at muffling sounds a great deal… I rediscovered how deafening silence can be.

(and learned how these deputies have no fucking clue what “quarantine” means… trust me I ASKED them).

Overhearing some inmate chatter, I believe Dustin was about my age (31) but was pretty deficient from the way he spoke, whether from drug use or a mental disability or lack of basic human decency setting in. This kid was in there for 8 weeks already according to the inmates; they had most recently turned off the water to his cell several days or a week prior because he was flooding the cell, so they’re supposed to take him out, let the water drain, and put him back in with no water for the night. This is an appropriate response and protocol until they ‘settle down’.

A deputy performing their final rounds introduced Dustin to a new shift coming on as “the guy on the permanent acid trip” and blamed his outbursts of random words, phrases, and sounds on his being on drugs or just another crazy asshole. When they would do meals, 3 times a day we got served something potato based or plain soggy oatmeal in the morning, and usually rice in the lunch and dinner, with some sort of turkey-based meat-thing, served through the tray door. One of the times they offered Dustin rice, he’d mention them looking like maggots, just a quirk not understood until later on. Each meal, 3 times a day, the first 3 days I was there, the deputies would open the tray door and comment on the smell, tell him to put some clothes on (he was always naked I guess), and close the door asap.

On my 2nd night, he lost his privileges to be served on his tray because he didn’t give back his lunch tray when they asked the first time… so they’d then give him a small plastic Dixie cup with water, and Styrofoam bowls for the other stuff the rest of the meals.

My 3rd night, Dustin had covered his little window in toothpaste and toilet paper, possibly as protest finally. The CO’s followed protocol in demanding him to remove it, asked what point he is trying to make, but he was refusing to communicate. They then entered his cell and dragged him on his belly, still naked, and took him to Strong psych; the door was closed immediately and the officers all joked about his crazy ass and how gross he made his cell. The next day I went to the phone area, and on my return the inmate Trustee I only know as “Sarge”, an ex-marine – was retching and coughing as he cracked open Dustin’s door to clean the cell… I was also able to catch a whiff and I tell you, it is the nearest to the scent of death itself I can imagine.

GRAPHIC PARAGRAPH BELOW – FAIR WARNING

Sarge put on a trash bag as a poncho, an extra jumpsuit, a mask and surgical gloves from the nurse’s cart… and scrubbed that cell like madman. He narrates his adventure: Dustin “had taken dump after dump for DAYS with no water and no ability to flush”, this eventually made him begin to vomit on top. After however long, cockroaches began gathering, the flies were landing, and yup… the maggots were growing.

Dustin had been dumping leftover food too. The guy didn’t like rice because it reminded him of the maggots. The toilet was so clogged that he had to snake the drain from the toilet side and the access panel multiple times… he pulled out a few garbage bags, water cups, and other random stuff.

Sarge continues to narrate: Dustin “drew stick figures on the wall, and used butter to glue his own hair on their heads…” the poor guy was so lonely in his silent cell that he made himself friends in there.

As far as I observed, this guy sat in his own filth, too afraid to say he needed help for fear of retaliation from deputies, or maybe he just didn’t know any better being mentally handicapped. Labeled a psycho, Dustin was mistreated as were the other guys just asking for basic human contact.

I finally broke down and took the TB shot, but they kept me there for a few more days, even beyond my court date (gotta love public defenders). Eventually I was moved to a public dorm where I was able to experience a different kind of deputy harassment, in bulk… and even assist an inmate uprising of sorts. If enough people would like to hear that one, I will keep that story separate to ensure this post remains as serious as it should be.

My final thought on this is... please explain how these highly trained officers of the law aren’t judged when they treat someone this way, to restrain a person ASKING coherantly for help?",24Mar2019,0

161,"I came up with this theory as I’ve been questioning the possibility of being bisexual lately. I really struggle to make sense of this.

There seems to be a part of my sexuality that is tied to my depression. Normally, when I am in a healthy headspace, I am pretty straight and men or the male body don’t do anything for me. However in a depressed state, the male body and homoerotic fantasies become much more alluring to me. My mental state effects which images that I seek out when aroused and determines whether I am active on gay dating apps or not.

My first response to these ideas is to think that I am somewhat bisexual but I do not desire intimacy or relationships with men, just their bodies. I have serious inhibitions thinking about what I would actually perform with another man whereas I am much more open with women. For example the idea of kissing a man turns me off.

I suppose it is might also be relevant that I see myself as more or a “bottom” when I have these fantasies.
