0,"Hi everyone, I don't want to wake anyone to listen to my endless nagging so maybe someone here can help me out. I'm from the Netherlands so sorry if my English isn't always correct but I hope to make myself clear enough to be understandable.

So here's the struggleslist.
I have had 2 very tough years in a row but now I am heading to a hopefully better year. In the past two years (counting 2018,2019) I've been depressed, lost, used by two guys, had a miscarriage from my ex, changed medication and many more things has happened.
- Somehow I feel lonely inside. I have my family and some friends but since my best friend has passed away last year (summer 2018) i feel like I am missing something or someone. So I rushed into bad relationships that caused me some mental issues, on top of the ones I already had myself (ADD, Autism and Borderline), like abandonment and commitment issues.
- I feel easily rejected. Like when someone asks me to do something for them and I don't want to or not in the mood and then they don't respond to my texts and stuff, I feel like I did something wrong. But I'm really the kind of person that chooses what I want to do or not. And no one can force me to do something I don't want to. But like I said when I don't do it they ""leave me"" on read of ignore me. And that gives me the feeling like I did something wrong and combined with some guilt. But then again I say to myself you did nothing wrong its their problem they can't control me. So I'm really conflicted with myself in that kind of situations.
- Since my new medication I can't eat or sleap on the right time. Yes I might be a evening/night person but sometime you'll have to get hungry or sleepy. Anyone who can relate to that and share some tips? I've already mentioned to my psychiatrist but I always get the same answers and already tried that.

I hope it's allowed to post this here. Otherwise I'll delete it. I hope someone in this sub is awake who can help me out or just be a listening ear if you want more details.

Help me out because I don't want to go back to the psychiatrist. I want those little things to fix myself and if I don't get this fixed by myself of course I'll get help. But I want to try this first. Helping each other can help yourself too. At least that's what I've experienced before.
So let me know. I won't sleep for a while.",27Dec2019,1
1,"I'm an 18 yo guy who's finished high school a few weeks ago and going to Uni next March. I literally have no close friends. I've never had one. I feel so lonely. During high school I was depressed for 4 out of 6 years  and I was bullied a lot because of my voice disabilities which makes my voice sounds like a blocked nose. I also stutter a lot. 

This prevented me from making friends because I felt like no one likes me and they would only put on an act to talk to me. I feel like my voice annoys other people. I can never talk emotionally. I don't know why. 

I have had a sleep disorder for the past few weeks. Last 2 or 3 nights I've only been getting 3 or 4 hours or sleep. I always move around my bed and I keep thinking about all my problems. I don't know why this is happening. 

Currently I'm in the hospital waiting for my dad to finish his appointment and I'm walking back and forth down the hallway because everytime I sit down I feel very lonely and depressed. I have so many bad thoughts about my past racing through my head and I don't know how I'm supposed to express all of them. 

I tried going to a GP but I still can't express my feelings properly because I have a hard time trying to explain things to people.",27Dec2019,1
2,"So, I had depression for two years in the past but I fought it on myself and most of the symptoms are gone, except for when it's spring or autumn, then I have like two week period when I feel awful, but I quickly recognise it and put myself together before I can attempt suicide for like 16th time in my life. I was diagnosed with BPD too, but whatever, it's possible to live with it.
For the last half a year life has been pretty good, except for a terrible anxiety I started having about a month ago (maybe a bit more). It started just as your regular anxiety, but now I legitimately lost sleep. The problem is, I'm not only anxious and constantly look around as if someone's watching me, but I genuinely feel that way. It all intensified when half asleep I started having hallucinations, if you can call them that. I start to fall asleep, hear the door open and quickly wake up in terror. 
The thing that pushed me to post this is that I started building those really f**ked up theories in my head. I was walking tonight and I thought: ""maybe the aliens are just pulling jokes on me and  laughing at me being a scared fool"". The next second I realized that it's not real, but I had a couple of similar thoughts for the past week. I do know that it's not real, but I still am uneasy and constantly look around with a flashlight like a freak. I am so scared for my sanity, I can feel the situation getting worse. I have seen people with paranoia and it's horrific, I really hope that there's a better explanation.
Can it be connected to my past mental health issues? 
Also therapy is not a variant, I live in a shithole where mental hospital are worse than crack houses and they put you there involuntarily. Hope you understand.",27Dec2019,1

4,"So, I really struggle with a multitude of issues and always have. I finally summoned up the courage to look for and start therapy. I had a couple specific therapists picked out but none were available. I went with like, my 6th in line. I’ve been to them 5 or 6 times and she actually doesn’t say much, she just listens to me talk. Which, don’t get me wrong, is nice. But it’s usually just a whole hour of me talking and if I don’t talk, she usually just waits on me to say something. I’m not totally sure what I expected, she does validate a lot of my feelings but I’m sure there are areas I can work on or advice someone would give me but she just doesn’t. I very clearly struggle with some diagnosable issues (and I don’t think therapist can’t technically diagnose things but they can easily offer some suggestions) but she just welcomes me, listens to me, and I schedule another appointment in the end. She doesn’t give me her opinion or any tips. Is this normal?",27Dec2019,1
5,"Today is the second time this year that I’ve subconsciously/intentionally missed a flight and I also have a long-standing habit of being late to the extend of failing my subjects back in school (which in my opinion seems to go beyond surface procrastination). There have also been other repeated behaviour patterns here and there that I am mindful of doing.

Are there any scientific roots to my behaviour since there seems to be an obvious pattern that is affecting my life and relationships? A simple Google search brought up the Self-defeating personality disorder (or masochist disorder) but There isn’t a lot of information that I can find online on the the disorder so I was wondering if anyone has recommendations for well-written and informational articles or even academic papers (hopefully not too difficult to understand for a layman). 

This is my first post on reddit. Nice to meet everyone.",27Dec2019,1
6,How can tell when someone is having a panic attack or an emotional breakdown. For example I have my moments some people around me say it's a panic attack while others (sometimes adults) will say I'm just trying to get attention at this point I can't tell what's what,27Dec2019,1
7,"Hello! I haven't been to the doctors in years and I don't know how to start dealing with my mental health. I live in the US (CT to be specific) and I have insurance, but don't know how to start this.

I don't like self-diagnosing, but for years I've been convinced that I have depression, anxiety, and BPD. I'm now 21 and I don't want to go into 2020 feeling so suicidal and unstable. I keep having episodes of extremely depressive mood swings and I keep lashing out to those around me, and I hate that. Today, I couldn't recognize myself in the mirror and felt so empty and numb. I'm just super tired of feeling this way but don't know where to begin.",27Dec2019,1

9,Today I woke up just feeling down. I’ve been going through a bit of a financial strain lately and today I couldn’t stop being hard on myself. Just felt like an overall loser who can’t seem to figure things out. Got in an argument with my boyfriend and all the emotions came out. I feel....just empty right now.

10,"I'm 21. I was homeschooled my entire life. Isolated from the world. I wasn't allowed to leave my house without my parents and had no friends. I've accomplished next to nothing in my life. Done nothing meaningful. I have no real special memories. Like my entire life has just been a blur. I don't feel alive, I don't think I ever have. And it kind of just feels like I should accept that and stop trying.

I hear people have done amazing things. Like going on an adventure. riding a school bus on their own. Being held by someone who loves them. Dancing with other people. So much of what I can only define as the human experience. I haven't had any of that. I can't even imagine what any of that would be like.

I don't feel human. I don't even feel real.",27Dec2019,1
11,"My morning started off really rough -- my husband and I said our morning prayers and were off to a fine start but then our moods changed fast and we got into a terrible argument that lasted for hours before we were finally able to reconcile. We thought we'd use the day to go to our local strip mall and see how we could spend our Christmas money -- this was a special treat for us, as my husband and I live in abject poverty and *never* have money to spend on ourselves. We used our Chic-fil-A gift card and then checked out the other shops.

I went into Ulta, and it was super overwhelming -- being so depressed for so long, I've always considered it such a chore to apply makeup, or even care about hydrating moisturizers or lash extensions. But I actually bought a pack of charcoal face wipes, and figured I would start there. Boy, did that one purchase create a mix of emotions and inspiration. I thought, you know, I use to *do* these kinds of things semi-regularly: wear a little bit of makeup, take extra care of my hair, worry more about my skin, etc. But all that went by the wayside years ago -- until today.

I felt bad about spending the money on myself, but my husband said we deserve to enjoy the little things. It took awhile for him to convince me, but I think he's right -- we're going to struggle for the next foreseeable future, so there's no harm in splurging on the simpler things that others enjoy often every now and then. I was so hyped by my new mindset, I came home and cleaned the bathroom til it sparkled. Just trying to enjoy it while it lasts. I hope everyone else is having a manageable day. :)",27Dec2019,1
12,"Everything is good with me, I have a happy family, good friends and a loving boyfriend. But for some reason there are days when I feel like I’m a waste of space or that I’ll never be good enough for the people I care about. I feel like my world is crumbling and something is terribly wrong, but I don’t know what it is. When I feel this way, I push everyone away and keep descending deeper into this state to the point that I start feeling suicidal. I want it to end but I don’t know how. I could be super happy and then it hits me like a truck. I’m tired of it.",27Dec2019,1
13,"I get extremely anxious when it comes to do tors and for my whole life have been avoiding it. I am 19 years old now and since I was around 7 I have been struggling with issues my family would say “I’d grow out of.” I always thought it could be OCD but I hadn’t had huge struggles with it since I was 13 but since a year ago it has become terrible again. When I was little if anyone touched me on one side of my body and didn’t do the exact same thing on the other side I would start having a tantrum that would not end until I found a way to hurt myself which was always me bending my back as forward as possible until it hurt. I do not find an issue with the mirrored touching anymore but it’s in different forms now. I have to count to a specific number when pouring water or else I feel like my family will die, when I’m driving my brain tells me to go towards a specific route or else my family will die, I have urges to touch random things and if I don’t I start to feel that uncomfortable feeling I get where my chest feels heavy on my body, I cannot sleep unless my bathroom door is closed for no reason, I have to make sure all my doors are locked even though I know my dad checks every night, I have a huge weird thing about someone touching my belly button and when it happens I try to rip my skin around it, anytime I have to put something in my bag that is important I have to check it at least 4 times to feel slightly at ease but I always find a way to check again, I have to lock my car enough times as I possibly can until I am out of range or the person with me gets annoyed, and I am writing this now because I was applying a screen protector on my iPad and started feeling how I felt when I was a kid throwing a tantrum crying on the floor because there are two air bubbles on the protector... I was wondering should I even bother to get help or is this just all in my head and everyones like this? There’s this huge issue with teens romanticizing having a mental disorder so when I mention I think I need help people around me think I am just trying to be cool.

15,"As someone who is facing intense moods sings lately, I go through a few weeks of really positive emotions and a few weeks of extremely negative ones. Though at first the emotions weren’t too intense, as they’ve become more intense I’ve started feeling bad when I’m in a good mood. 

I think part of me knows it won’t last, and I won’t feel this good in a few weeks. This positivity, hope and confidence won’t be there the next week and any progress I’ve made in catching up with work, booking appointments, etc, will be lost when I feel bad again. 

I don’t know what to do. There’s always a part of me in the back of my head that feels guilty about being happy in the moment, or dread that I know it won’t last. Any advice on why I’m like this, or how to prevent it?",27Dec2019,1
16,"I’m not asking for a diagnosis, I’m only asking for research or information.

I experienced a traumatic event when I was really young and just had a pretty shitty childhood. My stress got more and more until my mid teens when I had a flashback of the traumatic event and had a breakdown. Soon after that breakdown for about 2 years I had delusional thoughts on and off. I did some dangerous things because of my thoughts. For about 3 years now I’ve been “normal” (not sure which word to use). I have delusional thoughts pop up occasionally, but I recognize them and dismiss them very soon after they pop up in my mind (like seconds after). I have a mental health team but they’re out for Christmas. Towards the end of my last appointment with my therapist she was suggesting, based on new information I gave her, that I may have been misdiagnosed with schizoaffective bipolar, and it was instead a reaction to my trauma and PTSD. Is this a thing? Where there’s a difference between a prolonged episode of psychosis and an actual lifelong diagnosis? I’m going to ask my therapist and psychiatrist when I see them next but I’m really interested in hearing more information about this. This is life changing information for me, if this is true.

If you have any input I’d appreciate it very much. Thank you.",27Dec2019,1
17,"Hi reddit community, I’m scared. I overthink constantly and it might seems strange, but I kind of like it; digging deeper into the reasons why things are and not stopping until I find an answer. The problem here is that I’m constantly stressing, I stopped using things from before last year because I don’t want to associate myself with the old version of myself and that eventually lead to me being scared of using old things in general (for whatever reason), I feel like I’m wasting time when I’m doing something and also when I’m not. There’s so much more, but most of all Im scared that all of these insecurity’s are ultimately what’s holding me together. I don’t want to not be me and that’s why I’m scared of change, that’s why I overthink. An example of something I’m afraid of loosing is myself, like In this society people tell you to not be sad and that “it will always be ok” in a general context, but I along with so many other people know that it’s ok to be sad and it’s great to amazing your feelings. I don’t want to give in to society. I want to be truly me and I’m also scared that if I give up my insecurities that everything will go right and then I can’t learn from the things that I do wrong so therefor I just run into a self obsessed person that never learns for the better. Sorry for this mini rant, I don’t usually open up about this stuff. I’ve started going crazy overthinking evening so any advice would be much appreciated, thank you.",27Dec2019,1
18,"Hi everyone! I (23m) have recently started dating someone (23f) who has depression. I'd like any advice or tips on how I can help support her and be there for her. 

I've told her if she ever wants to talk or ever needs anything to let me know. The relationship is still young (\~a month) so I think she might not feel comfortable yet completely opening up to me. She has previously used sex as a coping mechanism before she started taking medication. However, in the past year, she has started self-harming as a way to cope as the medication isn't always effective.

She has said she's surprised she's still alive and didn't think she'd make it this far. When I see her marks, and I hear her say things like this I get really worried.

19,"Hi i'm a 17 male with Muslim background that lives in german so sorry for my Bad english. In my Family mental help is Seen as a sin. But because i live in germany they still got me a little help. But i never truly talked about what bothered me.

Im not the sole owner of this body. I share it with 3 people. Two usually dont take control of my body. And they talk with me. Tell me things and help me out. They help me a lot. And if u would put me alone in a room i would never be alone. Sometimes i even talk loud with them. But this often ends weird when an other Person enters the room.

But there is a third Person. I was bullied a lot. My fahter died when i was little. He tried saving me from a fire. So I always had a weird relationship to my mom. I could tell that she gave me the fault. We them grow up in poor condition. And in School i wasnt the Star. So they laughed me out when the teacher was there when we had Father events (we had events at our school to make the bond stronger between the son and Father). Well it didnt took long after that to find out why my dad was missing so they laughed me out for my father being dead. Well i always had those voices but after this i heard a New one. It said it will take the pain and the only thing i have to do is give him some time with the body. I agreed

I used him a lot. Sometimes i was just gone for a month before i had control over my body again. Well first he didnt do anything Bad. But after some time he got more violent. And it started becoming more in self harm and harm to others. One time i punched and broke a mirror. I cut my Hand really Bad. But nobody knew it was me. I nearly choked my sister to death. And more things. After that i knew i can't rely on him anymore.

Well i locked him up inside me. He screamed that i need him and i will come back. But he wasnt wrong. I still used him when i had something really stressful. Even when i didnt use him he tromented me. I couldnt tell anybody what was happening because he would Start an echo in my head. It was like an echo but it gets louder and louder. It would continue in my head until i stopped talking about it.
I one time talked about him and they wanted me to stay here. But my mom shot that down.

Well after some time i decided to never use him again. But then the true trouble started. The Echos would just happen randomly. Louder and cruel. I can't look in mirrors anymore because i always See someone else for an blink of a second. One time i had a Bad day and cried in the bathroom. When i went to clean my face i was smiling not this small grin but that creepy crazy one. If that made any sense. Well it scared me but when i looked again it was gone just my normal face. I started having violent thoughts. I couldnt stop thinking about killing people. My anger issue became a lot worse. I just feel this unbereable hatred. Sometimes i just Fell how im lossing control over my body.

I didnt mention everything because this would get to long

And thats Were the part Were i need help comes in. Im losing the fight i knew i will vanish in some time if i dont get this under control. Does anybody can give me advice. I can't visit a psycharatrist and im scared that i will kill somebody. I thought about suicide a lot. If it really came to the point that i will Start killing people.

Every moment of the relationship I get huge guild and never forgave myself for what I did. I kept digging myslef lower and lower. Which in hindsight made me worse and more insecure. But now I fear for future loves and future relationships because I can barely find support for who I am. Am I bad person? Did she do wrong too? Should I have known better? I’m ripping my mind apart everyday because I feel like I’m going insane on if I am a bad person or if things were jsut all bad. I’m going insane.

I have been yelled at constantly throughout my childhood.

Ive been noticing a general tense feeling whenever im near them or when i feel i need to go home 

However, all my life ive had the idea that people have a predisposition to hate me and would get angry at me very quickly as well. 

Recently after meeting my girlfriends parents ive noticed i can never relax while they are home as i feel as if they hate my guts and always have, along with the idea that they just might FLIP and scream at me constantly terrifies me while im with my girlfriend and it makes life very difficult having to stay on edge just in case all the time and i cant really figure out what it is. I cant convince myself im not hated and that they're not incredibly angry with me and will just flip and scream and want me out of their house at any moment. My girlfriend is starting to notice i act tense when theyre around or when i hear a noise in the house while theyre back and i feel very ashamed to explain as well. Its difficult to manage

27,"(TL;DR go to the third to last paragraph)

So for a bit of back story without going into too much detail, I always got told as a kid in school reports etc that I was doing well but seem to be ‘day dreaming a lot’. This was definitely the case for me, whether it was making up scenarios in my head or generally just zoning out. I had quite a traumatic childhood, so in hindsight I thought I was consciously or subconsciously using it as a coping mechanism/escape. I then noticed sometimes that I’d get these overwhelming feelings when being away from home, for example I’d feel anxious but didn’t know why, then I’d see a kid from the same estate from me and it would calm me down, or ‘bring me back’. I never knew why seeing people I knew helped this strange feeling, and at the time never related it to my ‘day dreaming’

Fast forward to my teen years, my family life was still hectic. Dealing with that on top of going through puberty and figuring life as a young adult etc, I noticed that this ‘zoning out’ was getting worse. In college I got told that it seemed I wasn’t interested/engaging with my course (which I actually LOVED), I got told it seemed I wasn’t bothered about being there etc. which I didn’t understand. Around this time I started binge drinking a lot too, and seemed quite disconnected from a lot of what was going on in my life, even though I was still functioning. I just felt it was a lack of concentration as I was under a lot of stress with all sorts of things to keep on top off. 

Throughout all of these years I had developed quite severe claustrophobia, and would have extremely distressing panic attacks in certain situations, and flight mode would always kick in so I’d leave whatever the situation was. Using lifts/elevators quickly became a massive NOPE for me, as well as most public transport. Of course with day to day life I couldn’t avoid a few of these things, so I’d take the steps to use coaches/trains if I had to. At this point I realised that I could cope slightly better with the panic attacks by ‘zoning out’ like I did most other things. 

As I turned into a so called responsible adult I took the step of trying Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, and at this point I obviously realised my coping mechanism had manifested into something much bigger. I realised that what I’d actually been doing a large portion of my life was Dissociating, and it was becoming a huge problem. 

By this point I had completely detached myself from reality through huge, stressful points of my life. I noticed that I had a feeling of complete amnesia when traumatic events were brought up. I had witnessed and had a number of extremely disturbing things happen to me but I felt no physical pain/anger/upset/distress when they happened to me because my brain was trained at this point to just completely detach itself from my body. I would also look back at traumatic events at times, but I’d be seeing myself from third person, as if I was a witness to what had happened and that it actually wasn’t me. 

Of course at this stage of my life I’ve come to terms with it being a negative response opposed to a good way to get through things (though almost all of us dissociate and some points). Even to this day I realise that I lose hours of my day because I don’t realise that I’m doing it. I have managed to control it a lot better using techniques from CBT, such as grounding (looking back I see why I felt less anxious seeing people I knew at school as that was grounding for me at the time).
 
As better as it is, I have recently become quite worried about what I feel is a strange variation of dissociation, if I can call it that? I went through a bad break up a month or two after another distressing event, that I hid from most people, barr my now ex. This happened at the start of 2019. I noticed that I’d be walking through my town to shop, go to work etc, and I always have my headphones in for music. Again I’m usually in my own world at this point, but certain songs would come on that would trigger really strange reactions. I can physically feel some form of detachment, sometimes so strong it would almost feel asif I’d been hit forcefully in the head, and I’d become really light headed/faint. Like it’s this sudden rush like I’d smoked a verrrrrry strong cigarette. Then my legs would feel like jelly and go weak too, and I’d start concentrating on starring at something (to ground) then my eyesight starts to throb like I’d been hit with the waves of a strong migraine, and my eyes go out of focus like when you stare at something for too long. Then I start getting strong heart palpitations, though not quite on the level of a panic attack. At this point my body obviously feels under a lot of stress and I start to feel nauseous and heave really strongly, though when it happens I don’t always be sick. The strangest part perhaps for me is that it can be the same song that triggers it, though it’s music that I only recently started to listen to and has ZERO memories/emotional feelings etc attached to it. But sometimes when this is the case and all of these things are happening all at once, I can sometimes hear the same quotes being repeated in my head? That I can also almost visualise?? And I feel like I recognise where they are coming from like a program or film I’ve watched recently but I can never end up pinning them to anything??? To make it worse, it’s often started to happen every time I’d walk past a certain set of traffic lights??? Which of course have no kind of special feeling to me??? It at first was happening multiple times daily for quite a few months, then eased off after time. I only really notice it now if I’m feeling quite stressed/anxious or just before I’m nodding off when my insomnia is really bad. 

I feel like I’ve done a rubbish job at explaining what happens with this, I’ve tried to find ways to google it but I can never find anything remotely similar with what comes up. Psychosis has been something I have looked into it being, but it doesn’t really seem to fit the bill. I also work in a psychiatric hospital and have tried asking qualified staff about it, which is hard to do talking to a colleague without expressing it’s happening to me!

If there is anyone that suffers with anything similar or anyone that could have a go at explaining what it is I would GREATLY appreciate it!!!",27Dec2019,1
28,"My very first post. (28f)
I wrote out a long ass post just now, and deleted all of it. 
I care way too much about what others think. 
I obsess and overthink. 
I grew up in a mindset where blaming the victim was funny. Mental health was kind of a joke 
I'm angry all of the time. I blame myself, my decisions and my circumstance the most. 
My depression is fighting me real hard lately. The urge to crawl under a rock and ignore the whole world creeps up on me. 
I've attempted suicide once. It will be a year next month.  I feel like I've wasted the last year just being a pile of garbage. I haven't gotten better. Haven't even tried.  
It's like I know what I have to do, and need to do, but Im lazy and want to wallow in my own self pity. 
But apart of me wants to get better just out of spite. Show the boyfriend who couldn't support me that I actually did succeed on my own, without him. 
Getting through this breakup while trying to fight my depression is a fucking chore and a half. I've never been so obsessed with a man. And I'm not proud of that at all.",27Dec2019,1

31,"My sister has been diagnosed with an eating disorder for 10 years now, but has had it for longer.

There have been a lot of health scares over the years where she's had to be taken in for medical treatment, some of which have been very scarring and left her petrified of staying in hospital. She has never gone to inpatient care for the disorder and has discharged herself from outpatient psychiatric  care for some time now. She's been on different medications for years, the list of which keeps growing, including being dependant on potassium for 10, a side effect of purging.
Basically, a bit over a month ago she suddenly had a seizure whilst the family were at the dinner table (something that never happens as it's usually just me her and my mum and I have eating problems too so we never eat together, but my other sister&amp;her boyfriend&amp; my grandpa were there which may have been a stresser). The seizure  seemed to be a reaction to the medication she was taking as it's a common side effect, and we all hoped it was a one time thing.
Fast forward to Christmas afternoon and we hear her crash down in the kitchen. It looks like it did before, rigid, mouth open, eyes wide. Ambulance called and they say it's not a seizure. It's her heart. They're so concerned she could have a heart attack that they won't leave, even though they can't make her go in. She eventually did go, but because they had to wait for so long and the build up of fear, she discharged herself against medical advice.  All tests they did get done came back normal compared to previous ones, but she took extra of her medication before they left.
Because they came back home and we all kind of didn't want to have a shit time dwelling on it pretty much, we redid Christmas today. She seemed fine for awhile but she started to look so distant again into the evening and I thought she'd just drop again at any moment. I feel like something is going to happen at night. I feel like I'm going to wake up to shouting that my sister is dead. When she sleeps in I think we're going to find her lifeless in her bed
I'm so sorry for all the monologue and maybe unessecary info. I've just never felt more like I may not have much time left with her and I'm so scared.
I don't know how to lose her. I don't know how anything can go on if that happens.",27Dec2019,1

41,"This might be long folks so be prepared

Hello Reddit, i am a 21 year old male From ireland And over the past 7 years i have been suffering From Depression, social Anxiety and loneliness . Only recently I have been Going out Trying to socialize But considering i spent the last few years isolating myself From the world i have lost contact With all my Friends From school. 

However, When i do Meet my school Friends the odd time when im out i basically Get blanked by Them cause They are with thier own groups of Friends or are in relationships so they dont have Time to speak to me.

I basically have to Go to Clubs by myself cause i have no one to Go with, I hate clubs but the main reason why i Go is because i just want a relationship with a woman (Which i have never had). Its not like im unnattractive in fact ive had Women Give me Compliments before and I do Work out alot But i just find it hard to Connect With women and just most people in general

Btw Im not Shy and i can Speak to people Quiet well but i am a introvert. 

I am Currently studying Computer engineering and i do enjoy it (Always have had an interest in engineering) But i just feel like im being Left out by this Society. 

Recently i Got let Go from my part Time job For literally No reason and Even Worse it was less than a Week after we had a Staff party, i was only at that Job For 3 months But i was getting Bored of it and the money was not good either. At the staff party i also felt like i was being left out and i actually had a Feeling That i was Going to lose my job anyway

But even before that Job The same Thing has happened to me Three Times with other jobs where i have been let go. I just dont have any luck when it Comes to fitting in With jobs 

One job i had The boss told me straight up to my face that ""I wasnt Good Enough"" and i got fired on the spot. i did lie on my application for that job tho cause i just wanted to be given a Chance to prove myself But unfortinatly it didnt turn out the way i wanted it to

Its like No matter How hard i Try to pull myself up out of this Hole that i put myself in I just keep getting Knocked back down Or No matter how hard i Try its just Not Good Enough

Now this is where it gets dark and I would NEVER share these thoughts To anyone Cause i fear that i would be Seen as a Crazy person or be arrested but here it goes:

Over the past Few months i have been Setting out a plan To Kill This pedophile Who lives Close To me, Everyone knows he is a pedophile but considering he is under police Protection people Dont want to do anything. I also have set Up plans To Kill others But these people Dont deserve to live imo. BTW I WOULD NEVER KILL ANYONE INNOCENT AND IM NOT A DANGER

I could Get away With killing these Targets if i want But i want to get caught cause i want people to view me as a hero. I want people to Know that i did it

Id rather be in jail but seen as a hero Rather Than be some 40 year old lonely Loser Who has nothing to live for and Works a Shitty Job

All i really want is a Decent paying job, To feel accepted by this society and A Woman Who i can Build with and Eventually start a family With but i just Feel like i will never get any of Those Things.

Her paranoia highly revolves around the government/medical field and a secret evil society being intertwined trying to kill off everyone. 

She literally sleeps in a home made cage made out of layers and layers of window screens she built to prevent the damage of the people who come outside our house at night and try to microwave her while she sleeps

I began to watch porn all the time, and behaviors like these continued from 3rd grade to 8th grade. it progressed from just rubbing to touching each other, and most of the time it would be a part of us playing pretend. in middle school oral became involved too due to us learning more about what sex was. during this whole time period I was honestly kinda hyper sexual, I was constantly thinking about sex or wanting to have sex.

48,"Hi all, I've been working out my entire life, going through periods of intense weight training, to getting myself into marathon shape, to just casual workouts to maintain my health.

I've always considered exercise a part of my life and not a hobby. It's just something I've always done.

About a year ago, I was running at the park as I've done countless times. That day, for the first time in my life, I nearly passed out from my run. I'm not sure what it was, but I'm guessing I was dehydrated.

Ever since then I started suffering from panic attacks and for the longest time I couldn't figure out why. I went to my doctor, did all the blood work and all the heart check ups and I appear to be in good health.

Recently I saw an article about ""exercise induced anxiety"" and it got me thinking if this is the root cause of my panic attacks. It seems like this is a fairly common issue because the feelings associated with panic attacks are typically those felt during intense exercise.

Short of taking an exercise stress test (which my doctor doesn't think I need), I can't think of anything else that would be causing me panic attacks.

The part that bothers me the most (outside of the panic attacks, which sometimes keep me up at night), is that I enjoyed working out and find myself going to the gym less and less.  I'm about 15lbs heavier than I'm used to being because I'm not being as active as I used to because I'm scared of triggering another panic attack.

It’s a constant struggle because I want to die but I don’t want to feel the physical pain of suicide. I would just want to down a bunch of pills. I have no reason to be depressed...I have a roof over my head and food on the table every day🤷🏽‍♀️. Some days I just think about what it would be like if I just went away. It’s so hard to pay attention in class because all I wanna do is just sleep or lay in my bed just binge watching movies.

When I’m depressed, it’s like a deep pit that is bottomless. You keep falling and it can last for days, weeks, or years. The metaphorical pit is my depression and mental state, and the bottomless part of the pit is suicide. I keep falling because I know that I probably won’t kill myself but I’ll always have the pain of feeling bd thinking about it.

52,"So my family has lots of mental health problems. Mostly from my fathers side. This isn’t a mental health problem, exactly, but a weird tick-like behavior that I’ve only ever seen in my family.

I have this, as well as two of my brothers (another doesn’t have it) it differs for each of us, but the basic idea is you have an object and do a repetitive motion with it, and while you’re doing so you kind of just, imagine things. Like writing. Mostly stories.

An example is my brother. He has two pens and he kind of clicks them together. My dad had a washcloth he twisted and carried around.

We do specific things to modify the thing we use, like my brother takes apart the pen because it’s lighter.

We do this a few times a day, and feel compelled to do it. If we don’t do this we have more ticks than usual and feel generally stressed.

53,"Hi reddit strangers,

I am in a bit of a not-so-fun situation regarding my family and I am reaching out for insight on how to process and deal with this situation (please note: doing my best to include relevant details but I am not sure I'll get them all in). I have x-posted with r/relationships, r/mentalhealth, and r/mentalhealthamily. If this post doesn't belong on this sub, please let me know.

This is gonna be a long one but here is some background about my family. Currently, I [31M] am living in the midwest (US) with my girlfriend [26F] (she owns the house in her name alone, while I pay her rent and split utilities). I have three siblings [24F, 29M, and 35M]. My younger sister and older brother (who has Down Syndrome) live with my mother [59F] in the northeast, while my younger brother lives on the west coast. 

My mother's mental health has been in decline for more than 10 years. In 2007, my father passed away and the next year, she started to not feel safe in her home as she told me (I was away at college) that she was being followed by people who she believed wanted her to move out of the neighborhood. She claimed she was being followed everywhere she went and that several people approached my younger brother and asked him questions about where he lived. Long story short, she was convinced her life was in danger and moved from the west coast to the east coast.

Over the course of several years, she had become convinced that the state she lived in at the time was trying to kill her, take custody of my older brother, and perform medical experiments.  Additionally, she became convinced that her in-laws living in the area were plotting with the state to kill her. Year after year, she became more desperate to move and leave the state. She had gone from living in a house to renting an apartment and had ceased working. 

Two years ago, she finally moved to the northeast, where my younger sister was attending college and when my sister graduated, she moved in with my mother. Currently, my mother still believes that people are out to killer her and that they are comprised of her relatives, those who were part of the state she lived in, and the leasing office where she currently rents. Convinced she is under constant surveillance, she has boarded up all windows and covered any and all blinking lights. Additionally, her only income comes from gov't assistance (I don't remember the exact one) and my sister covers a large majority of the bills. Additionally, my mother (being an African immigrant) constantly volunteers my siblings and I to provide money to her in-laws and her own siblings whenever she gets a money request (something I am beginning to push back against). My sister and I are talking about the possibility of our mother moving closer to me but... it's complicated.

There are several issues at hand:

1. My sister living with my mother is ruining both her financial and mental health (she's been going to therapy for a number of issues).

2. My younger brother has essentially detatched himself from the situation as he and my mother do not have the best relationship. Additionally, he discovered religion as a way to get through some of the family issues and trauma that he dealt with growing up.

3. My girlfriend and I are looking to get married soon, and I have a host of concerns about my mother moving closer to me as she would likely become a financial drain and an emotional/mental one.

4. Lastly, I suspect that my mother has an un-diagnosed mental illness that she refuses to acknowledge and get any form of therapy for. She has not worked a job is almost 7 years, has little to no computer skills, and does not have a car of her own (she sold it and now confines herself to her apartment). 

I want to know: what options are there for my siblings and I? Does it make sense to move her? What resources can I seek out?

54,"So I'm a kid (early teen) and iv been suicidal since I was 8 or 9, I know it sounds early but it's true. I always thought that I'd be dead by 12 and I'm now over that. I barley ever feel happy and always feel anxious. Anxiety only recently became an issue for me. I constantly self harm by cutting, burning and occasionally stop myself breathing. I don't really know why but I have to. I also constantly smoke and abuse other substances. I can't sleep and haven't for three days I don't think I can handle it for much longer.

[26F] So. Honestly... I don't know how the hell I made it this far, especially to the end of the year. This year was not kind to me at all. Especially the summer: losing my now ex-girlfriend (not dead, just a soul-crushing, VERY heartbreaking breakup and neither one of us have completely gotten over it), having to move out of my best friend's house (Oklahoma City) to keep our friendship intact because I know I drove him nuts not being able to help him with rent and utilities (although most of his stress really came from his shitty ex-girlfriend), moving back home waiting for school to start and feeling like burden to my family or like I didn't belong there, racking my head over when the VA would get my disability squared away, saying or doing stupid things and ending up with an egg on my face (I still unintentionally do it now), lots of anxiety attacks, never being able to get out of my own way... yeah. Big oof. This was all in May.

Fast forward a month. I'm home now (Fort Worth), and how hilariously ironic it is that it didn't take me very long to land a job; I almost immediately got a call back from FedEx. Background check kinda took forever, but I still got to work. Fast forward another month. My disability FINALLY comes in, and it's all the money I was owed since January. Huge relief washed over me. I worked at FedEx for about another month before I had to quit for school. I loved it there though. My coworkers and my managers loved me (because I actually worked, lmao).

Fast forward to fall/winter. School is finally here (I go to OCU, Oklahoma City University for those that don't know) and this first semester felt like a roller coaster. Constant stress because I was struggling in two classes, waves of depression thinking about other bad things that happened to me, and I have GERD. Or GERD-like symptoms. Well, had them for a couple years, they haven't been this bad until now. It's my own fault though, I ate like complete shit and when I was depressed it only got worse because I would either overeat or not eat at all. I've finally had enough of said symptoms, so I went to the doctor two days ago. He wants to do some tests but we have to get them scheduled first. I hate not knowing what's wrong with me. The unknown scares me. It's gotten to the point that I've started to diagnose myself (went searching on the internets about GERD, worst mistake ever because I fell into a rabbit hole) but my mom has been so patient with me. I also started my period RIGHT before I drive home for Christmas, probably explains why I've been so damn emotional and crying so much this week. Oh, and I unknowingly drove into a crater in a parking lot last week so my back bumper's gone and I have no idea how much it's gonna cost to fix it. Fun.

But even through ALL of this... I made it. I survived the semester and I even passed all my classes! My best friend and I hang out whenever possible (his work schedule sucks) and even my ex and I hang out because she just graduated college and lives up here too. Even though we're not together anymore, we still want to be friends so we keep making the effort even when it gets rough. I want to change. I want to be better. I'm tired of crying and being mad at the world all the time. I'm tired of hating myself and the way I look. I'm tired of letting things control my mood. I'm tired of internalizing everything because THAT. SHIT. SUCKS. It HURTS. I'm ready to get it all off my chest now. All of it. I thought about something my mom told me a few days ago: ""You don't want to be the person that suffers from depression, you want to be the person that lives with depression."" And you know what? I fucking agree. I've already started taking steps, but I'm not where I want to be yet. But I know what I'm doing is the right thing.

Phew, that was a lot. It felt good to type it though. Maybe this year wasn't a complete shitfest like I thought. Thank you for letting me vent/air it out and sharing my story. If you made it this far, awesome. If not, well, that's understandable too. Let's go into the new year and kick its ass. All of us.",27Dec2019,1

I have a boyfriend, and he's honestly all i have. I have friends of 4 years but I'm not close to them at all. I have some family issues that stop me from being able to leave the house much (at most once a month) which is part of the reason we're not really that close.

And as i mentioned, I'm not close to any family members either. We have issues so we never really talk to each other or really meet.

I also don't have any hobbies or anything to keep myself busy with. So, quite literally, my boyfriend is the only thing that keeps me from feeling lonely, and my only source of happiness.

We text all the time, watch movies and play games together. As long as he's free we're always with each other. (I am always free so it all comes to him. I usually only sleep when he does anyway.)

And well, that causes one little problem. For the time that he's not with me, I'm completely miserable. I feel so unhappy and lonely even if it's just him hanging out with friends.

I, of course, never show or tell him about this because I'm terrified to death about affecting him negatively. I'm so terrified of becoming something toxic to him.

I really want to stop feeling this way, I have tried finding hobbies to keep myself busy but i never really was that interested for long.
I tried finding friends but it never really works because it's obvious that I only talk to them for the time he's not with me and i feel horrible for just using them for that matter so I don't want that to be an option anymore.

65,"Hi guys,

I wanted to share my personal story with you guys because I hope it could help someone to know that there is other people having the same type of problems. I am a 19 year old female from Eastern Europe, and I graduated in May this year. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder 2 years ago, as a result of a trauma I had in my boarding school and also family issues. I had a therapy in the first month after diagnose and then I don't know why, I just cared even less. I went on with school and stuff but I eventually had such bad grades and attendance I now have to take those 2 years extra. I am very unmotivated to live and I have had suicidal thoughts for the past year, but in phases, not daily. I still go to work and I cook, do housework and farm work but I can see that my parents don't consider me as their child anymore, only a guest who they hope will move out someday. I have also had my mother telling me in honesty that she thinks I ruined my life, and in anger telling me she hopes I die soon. My father rarely talks with me. I also have a 6 year old brother.

However, I do still have some nice gifts from life. I am aware that the situation in my country is not ideal but I still have food, shelter, ability to educate myself and to work. I also have a long distance boyfriend from England, he has been a great support and doesn't want me to die. I am also with, although definitely not democratic, but definitely peaceful environment with no war. So I am aware I am privileged in some things in life, and I am very grateful for that. I hope one day I will feel better and be a healthy young woman.

I just want to say to people reading this, it's normal to feel like this and also not have any improvement in weeks, months, even years as you can see. I do still fight all that same problems, but I still have moments where I want to give up for eternity. But, even though it could be annoying as fuck, just hopefully trust me and sometimes blindly follow your low will to live. It will be worth life.

P.S. I am not self diagnosed. Depression and anxiety I mentioned in text were diagnosed by 2 psychologists and a psychiatrist. Just to clarify shortly.",27Dec2019,1
66,"So I guess for a bit of info, I don’t really have recognisable emotions much. Like everything feels completely disconnected and I don’t really feel real or like a person. I get rare intense feelings of either frustration or depression that apparently lasts anywhere from like a couple of minutes to an hour, but then it just goes back to robot mode. It’s been like this for as long as I can remember (maybe like 12-ish) plus my thoughts are about suicide 24/7 so idk. I’ve brought this up with my therapists before but they all just kind of brush it off. Is this normal?? I tried to kill myself a while ago (admittedly it was a poor attempt) but after waking up it mostly was just like “ok”. 
I know I have some mental illness but idk where to go with this. Nothing really upsets me and nothing makes me happy or excited or anything else really except again for those brief periods where I get super intense feelings. Anyone got any ideas??

67,"Alright everyone,

Feel like shit and want to off myself because I can’t fend for myself aged 20/can’t sustain myself and am reliant on my parents when other people aren’t.

I can’t live with my Dad &amp; I’m pretty sure my Mum doesn’t want me at her house anymore either, so I want to go it alone...but I can’t. I need to live with my Mum rn because I can’t earn enough to sustain myself alone.

It’s depressing me because I feel like other people my age can fend for themselves and even look after others and I can’t, so I feel like I should just commit suicide because I’m worthless to humanity.

I also feel like the only way I can get out of this mental health situation is by seeing a therapist, which would require money from my Father, when other people in the same situation don’t need money from their parents to survive/don’t have any help.

Any thoughts anyone?",27Dec2019,1
68,"I don't know where to start but I think a little background is necessary. I have two brothers, and my younger brother was recently (2017) diagnosed with schizophrenia. 

When he was in the 12th grade, my father put a lot of pressure on him to take up engineering. He cried so many times but at that time my father believed that he had 'to make a tough guy' out of of my brother and so sent him to another city to study for this program. Long story short, he was isolated and failed the first year of undergraduation twice. After that my father relented and my brother dropped out of engineering and began studying for another program. This was when his psychotic breakdown fully took hold. In the last two years he had begun telling us that one of my father's employee was harassing him and had been looking at him the wrong way. (This was all completely false by the way, we checked). My father ignored his complaints and my brother took that very personally. Later on, when he joined the new program, he began telling me that people in the class whisper about him all the time. He told me things like someone sitting next to him had a spirit enter their body and they then turned and threatened his life. I asked him if anyone else saw this and he said no, only he saw this (though they were surrounded by their classmates). He then told me that he can 'hear' people's thoughts and he knows that people are pitying him, thinking of harming him or simply pointing out his flaws. I think I got truly alarmed when he once texted me that he was 'going to have to do something' about the guy who had been looking at him wrong. After some time, he told me that in a few days he would be leaving us all and going to a better place. I am 95% sure he was talking about committing suicide.

My parents are old school skeptics and didn't belive in psychology. They thought that going to psychologist is only for people who harm people and things and go to jail. The last two statements made by my brother made me extremely worried and so I begged my parents to go to the doctor. They eventually did and got him medicines that when mixed with food, help someone who's had a psychotic breakdown - and they are essentially tasteless.

Things were going well until a few months ago when my brother again became very obsessed with the divine and religion. He is a religious guy and I understand his curiosity about it. But now he was again talking about how the planets are trying to harm him and how his time is going to change and a new him will come out soon. He knows he is schizophrenic and was always good with taking medicines. But a few months ago, he told my parents that he doesn't want to take them anymore. At the same time, he started texting me about planets and talking about how the demon is out to get him.

I try really hard to not talk to him with emotions or feelings. My elder brother calls me and says that my younger brother is locked up in the room the whole day, is not studying and not even going out of the house to walk the dog. I am now supposed to move back home and my brother recently told me that he will be living in my room as his room has 'negative energy'. Leaving aside the fact that my own room would obviously give me more comfort, I am fed up with the way my parents are handling this situation. When they should have been easy going they chose to be tough and now when they should be forcing him to take his medicines and be practical about his future, they're giving into his whims and fancy.

I sometimes worry that when my parents die, which is a huge worry in itself (my mom recently survived stage 2 cancer), my elder brother and I would have to look after our younger brother. I refuse to deal with someone who won't take his medicines and believes there is a demon in his stomach whose ultimate goal is to destroy him. I mean I may have a family in the future and I can't let someone tell me that we've to move because they sense negative energy in the house. Yet, I am the more emotional and empathising one of the lot. My elder brother has told me in no uncertain terms that he doesn't want anything to do with my younger brother.

I want my parents to be strict with him and force him to take his medicines and I am ready to put an ultimatum on my younger brother that if he doesn't do the bare minimum and take his medication, then I will not speak with him. Would I be the asshole for showing some tough love?

I also know that schizophrenia harms the one affected by it more than it harms others but at the same time, I don't want to look at my brother as if his entire life is now doomed and give into the unreasonable demands and notions he asserts. 

If you made it this far, thank you. I hope I get to hear other perspectives as well.",27Dec2019,1

72,"tw: suicide, alcoholism

I never thought I would be where I’m at right now. A couple of days ago I went to 7 eleven and bought a $4 bottle of wine which I drank and finished within the night. This was my first time drinking in a while since I decided to get sober. The next day I drank 3 liters of wine and don’t have any memory from that day and the next. All there is to show for what happened is a giant hole in my bedroom wall, a bloody scar on my lip, and a very painful bump on my head. I vaguely remember feeling seriously suicidal for the first time instead of it just being a passing thought.

My dad is strict and controlling and I’m living at home until I start my new job in 9 months (I am fully graduated and in my 20’s but I still have an 11pm curfew). I have started anti-depressants and they seem to have been starting to work until these episodes. I’ve been having problems with my boyfriend but the thought of him finally texting me back after a couple of hours gives me the most painful sinking anxious feeling.

Please- I would like someone to talk to who can just listen to me vent without judgment and maybe offer some glimmer of hope or perspective on things. My therapist told me she is not specialized in alcoholism— and either way she is not available until January. Please leave a comment and/or DM. Thank you

75,"Hi everyone,

Basically, I'm looking to see if anyone has any advice for dealing with rather severe social isolation. I am a freelance remote worker, and due to my financial situation and personal interests, I'm taking this time to travel basically full time in Eastern Europe, and have been doing this since March of 2019. I move to a new country in Europe (I'm from the US) every three months due to visa restrictions. Due to connections from Church (I am Eastern Orthodox), I will know a few people in each city I move to, most often a local priest or monastic establishment, i.e. someone who can help me with things but not someone I'd hang out with.

Because I work from home, I am basically alone all day. I do have hobbies, that I put a decent amount of time into and genuinely enjoy. I play strategy games, play the drums, and go out skateboarding every day. I read a lot, and generally have an active inner life as far as my hobbies go. I also talk a lot online to friends in the states and elsewhere. I've contacted a few groups via facebook that I found that have board game meetups, which is something I really enjoy and find fun. I want to try going to cafes to work because I notice that just being in public/having that minimum baseline of interaction helps my mood a bit. I've tried using Tinder but find it kind of depressing, and don't think I'm really interested in dating at the moment. If it's relevant, I'm a 26 year old man.

Nevertheless, as it stands, I'm basically alone all the time. Days go by where I say 0 words aloud to another person, and where nobody so much as looks at me or notices I'm there. I have had mental problems including severe anxiety, depression, paranoia and panic disorders for most of my life, but thankfully those are now in really good shape and I deal with them appropriately, haven't had panic attacks in years, and my depressive episodes are just a day or two in bed as opposed to a months long fiasco. Still, this lack of human contact has had a really bad impact on me. Since it's something I'm gonna be dealing with to some degree for a while, I was wondering if anyone knows things that can help.

As I said I'm trying to get out there more socially, which is a bit hard to do here in a country where I'm not fluent in the language and will only be for a few months. Given this non-ideal situation, what are my options? Which mental techniques and practices are good for dealing with this type of isolation? If anyone has any ideas, please let me know. I'm trying to just take each day at a time and not get too stressed about it, but every once in a while something hits hard and I find myself getting depressed (just found out a woman I liked a lot for a long time back in the US got engaged, etc).

77,"Hello reader, 

I'm going to try to keep this short as this an embarrassing post, but I've decided to just throw it out there and see if maybe someone else has struggled in a like manner or overcome something similar. 

**TL:DR - would appreciate advice overcoming idiosyncratic sexual repression**

I am almost 25, never had a girlfriend (I had chances in high school and university but I just never was confident enough to really try), I'm a virgin, however I'm not one of these socially inept persons who can't talk to women/people nor am I completely inexperienced sexually (but it has been almost 4 years since I've even kissed a girl), I've been told by a beautiful girl that I am ""a very good-looking guy"" (though it was a strange setting not conducive to getting intimate so that confused me), I have also been called ""cute"" many times, and I've always wanted a girlfriend since grade 5 or so. So it seems like your typical case of, ""just haven't met the right one yet"", right?

Well, the thing is, is that I feel as though all my past failures/missed opportunities have somehow culminated into some sort of anxious repression or suppression of sorts, let me explain.

I think I've internalized my lack of relationship experience to a point where I feel like there is this huge pressure for me to find a girlfriend, hence, every time I meet a woman that I'm attracted to I feel all the internal and external pressure for me to ""bag this one"" so to speak, and due to this psychological pressure, I try my best not to let it consume me and so I react by dismissing any impulses relating to displaying affection or attraction so as to not come off as needy/desperate, but then I feel like I'm catch-22ing myself into never getting a girlfriend via inaction, and I haven't even explicated the worst part of this psychological state... 

I frequent parties that my friend's throw, and sometimes there's an ""eligible bachelorette"", and when the alcohol is in me I become more confident/flirty for sure, though I still keep a guard up somewhat I would say, so this thing happens, whenever I truly believe that this pretty girl might actually want to be intimate with me in the very near future or future in general (as evidenced by her eyes or playful touching or flirtatiousness for example, and not via my figment of imagination), this mild anxiousness sort of washes over me, and I'm never anxious (and yes I know what anxiety is like b/c of past panic attacks via pot) and quite literally (warning: slightly explicit) my penis will retract in a way similar to that physiological response that occurs when blood is required somewhere else more urgent, and this strange reaction has been fucking with me so bad I feel like I've developed some sort of sexual anxiety, because this didn't use to happen when opportunities with women seemed plausible. 

So, I'd appreciate any advice from people who've overcome something similar, but I would still appreciate any sincere comments, also, I'm really not keen on seeing a therapist though that or doing psychedelics are probably the most viable solutions.",27Dec2019,1

82,"I don't understand why mental health is taken so separately than regular health concerns. There is always so much talk of how to fix something, what exactly to do, but never an explanation of how one gets started or applies it. You get diabetes, you get insulin shots and watch your glucose. You get a wound, you clean and bandage it. You get mental illness and you're told to ""just get better"".

All the self-help, pep talks, epiphanies and realizations are what I would call ""software updates"" but the brain is physical, and most mental health issues if not all have shown that there is a distinct different in scans from those with illnesses and those with out. Why are we treating it like a software problem when it seems there is a hardware problem? We even have proof of various mental health disorders being directly correlated to genetics.   
Medications can help, but the overall approach to mental health is treating it like it's self-treatable but with guidance to updating your software yourself. My software is fine, I have all the information in the world to get over every issue I have, but it's like asking someone to jump a hurdle who not only doesn't have any training or idea how to jump, but doesn't even have legs. You can understand the concept, but you have no tools to do it.

This is insanity. I don't understand why more resources aren't being poured into understanding the human brain and figuring out how to rewire parts that are clearly not wired correctly.  We lost not only lives, but potential workers, potential innovators, or just happier people who want to contribute because they feel something to live for, like normal.

Every mentally ill person I've ever met has met ""The wall"" that invisible wall of resistance that prevents you from doing the thing you know very well would help, is good for you, you need to do and will ultimately make your life better. And you can't fucking do it. No one has an explanation as to how to get over it. Just that some people do, so it's possible if you ""will"" it. If willing anything actually worked, you wouldn't have mental health issues in the first place. This is why I'm calling it a hardware problem, no different than cancer, no different than a wound that needs treatment. It's physical and tangible and yet we tell people that their ""mindset"" is wrong. We tell people to just buck up at worst or to ""go to a happy place"". People clearly can't ""just do it"". They would of already. And I'm so sick of the brain and mental health being treated as software, this mysterious magical place that holds the key to happiness if we just will it and work at willing it. 

Guess what, lots of people clearly can't work their ""will"" muscle because they don't have one. What then? What do you say to someone who doesn't have tools to ""build a foundation""? Just do it anyway? That's the obnoxious, unhelpful and dangerous message so many people get. It's no wonder they feel hopeless, useless and defeated. They're all being told to just jump, to just build a house when they don't have bricks or tools or hands to do it with, because their hardware isn't functioning right and it couldn't the the furthest thing from their fault. Yet they get all the blame, mostly internal. Mentally ill people are the worst bullies to themselves, because they are constantly told something must be really wrong that's their fault for not being able to ""just do it"".",27Dec2019,1
83,"I know this girl and she used to be happy and outgoing but now over the last couple months she just seems completely different. She gets angry all the time and always looks depressed. She does work but when she's not at work she just sleeps and goes and drives around. She has physically attacked people but now she mostly just verbally yells at people. She started screaming at this person in the grocery store for looking at her and flipped him off. Idk it is just so out of character. I have tried asking her what's wrong but she just says nothing and hides in her room or the bathroom. She says she's sick all the time but then like an hour later she will be happy and fine and then she's sick again. It just seems like she just doesn't care about life anymore.

85,"hi.. idk where to start. i made this account so long ago because i wanted to talk about my feelings to people who may be able to relate but i just found myself reading everyone elses and keeping mine to myself..

Anyway, i guess i just needed to talk for a second. i was doing so good a bit ago. like better than i had basically my whole life. i moved in with my girlfriend a few months ago.. in fact i moved to a whole different state. i finally got away from my toxic, abusive family and i’m with someone who makes me feel like love is real. she kinda tought me what love is in a way. being loved and in love is a feeling i never thought i’d have, and i truly love every second of it.

I don’t really know where i’m going with this, i guess i’m just getting back into my old way.. I haven’t been on medication when i got here because my mom always over medicated me with medicine because she didn’t think feelings other than happy were allowed. Ive been diagnosed with depression and anxiety since i was young and just earlier this year with manic bipolar. 

I guess i’m gonna talk about some of my past because it’s been messing with my head a lot and sometimes i feel like it’s eating me up inside. So i may just be throwing word vomit all over but i hope this is all okay for this tag. my mental health is just... getting so low again. 

My dad is schizophrenic and also manic bipolar and i’ve always been terrified of me suffering like that as well. It’s something that’s always in the back of my head that i could be living with exactly what he is, and i’ll never even know until i have psychotic episode and it’s too late for me to think rationally about it. My sister recently experienced an episode and was in a mental hospital for a couple months.. i didn’t even go back to my state to visit.. i felt too hurt and scared to be around her after everything.. it still haunts me. everything eats me up with guilt and i feel like i’ll die feeling guilty with this one. i just couldn’t forgive her... anyway.. my dad. He’s been an alcoholic my whole life and pretty abusive emotionally as well as the occasional physically. I don’t know if this is really important i just thought it mattered as i’m kind of rambling a lot right now. 

My mother has been a compulsive liar my whole life and i’m still getting to a stage of finding out certain things about my own life she’s faked me to believe. i never realized any of these things about her when i was younger and as i’m getting older.. it all hurts so much and it’s so hard to go through. I’ve never resented her though.. Never even wanted to show her i was mad because i felt bad. I felt bad about any feelings i had ever. 

I’m slowly learning all the manipulation and abusive i’ve been put through and it’s made me feel so numb. Despite it all i’m still doing better than i ever have living with them. my girlfriend is ALWAYS there for me and talks me down from situations i have never been able to be talked out of or even talked myself out of. But the thing is.. is i feel like such a burden to her and her family. i have so much baggage. i have a lot of pain. i try to talk myself out of feeling the pain and all my feelings but it’s always there. 

My head is so bad to me.. sometimes i feel like i can never control the bad thoughts about myself and i feel like i hate myself. somedays i hate everything about myself, sometimes i hate everything wrong with me inside and sometimes everything that’s on the outside. but i always hate something about me. i don’t know.. i can never be nice to myself and to be honestly i really don’t want to. i don’t feel like i deserve it. 

I dont even know where any of this is going i just kind of keep writing.. it feels kinda good to talk about this stuff even if no one cares. 

{HI TALK OF SEXUAL ASSAULT RIGHT HERE. IF YOU ARE TRIGGERED BY THIS PLEASE DO NOT READ!!! IM SORRY}

i was raped as a kid by my babysitter for a long while. for so long after i just had nightmares about it and it never realy felt real. i only came to terms with it like 2 years ago and i struggle with it everyday. i still struggle sleeping or even getting my mind to shut off ever. it messed me up so much growing up. i could never and still can’t be in a room with a man by myself. i cant have anyone touch my thighs without forgetting how to breathe.. i cry about it randomly and whenever i see someone who even has the same facial hair as him i breakdown and feel inconsolable. Sometimes i feel hallow.. and i always felt like i could never love or be able to feel loved..

A little over a year ago i attempted suicide... It was all i wanted for so long and eventually i just.. tried to go through with it. obviously i’m still here and i always felt mad at myself for still living... i kept wanting to try and make it successful once and for all but i guess all in all i just got to sit there and hate and be mad at myself for that as well. 

So i guess where i’m getting at is... for a while i’ve genuinely felt.. okay in my head. I felt kind of excited to wake up the next day. to spend time with my love and try to experience realy happiness. of course i had my breakdowns every once and awhile. still had my nightmares. still had my panic attacks. but everything became such less frequent. i was learning to talk myself out of my panic attacks and control my breathing after waking up from nightmares. It was such a good feeling to feel okay.. a feeling i’ve never felt. 

Now i guess lately i can feel myself slipping back into something or another. my head is mean and evil to me again. i cry a lot.. like everyday. i talked to my family for the first time in awhile and of course they had nothing but evil, spiteful things to say. those things stick with me.. just like everything they’ve done and they’ve been getting to me more often. i think about them a lot. i think about my lack of family in my life and how i kinda don’t have anyone besdes my girlfriend and a couple people from her family. which is more than enough, but my head makes me think the opposite of things all the time. on top of it and i guess not as importantly, i’m financially... nowhere.. i don’t have anything really to my name. i’m 19 years old and i used all my money to move to a different state to get away from people who have made my life hell.. yet i still find myself asking if it was worth it.. was it worth it if i can’t save up enough money and am kinda just living barely enough to support myself?? should i have stayed so i wouldn’t have been a burden on everyone including myself?

I kinda feel like im just putting myself into a bad place but at the same time i can’t even control it. I really really don’t wanna get stuck in that horrible horrible headspace i was in all my life. i can’t be in that situation again. I dont think i could survive it again. and i certainly can’t put someone i love in that situation with me. No matter how many times she tells me she’s there for me and will always love me.. i could never put anyone in that situation with me..

What if i am just going to be a burden for the rest of my life? What if i am just as unlovable as i see myself as? 

I’ve been slowly feeling less and less significant again. I feel regretful for being alive a lot more frequently. I feel mad at myself for everything and feel bad for everything i do. i feel like i’m making mysef think nobody likes me again.. i don’t know, maybe no one does..

This is really long and probably doesn’t have a point. I guess i’m just trying to put all my feelings out there since i’m sitting in the bathroom crying quietly and trying not to be a burden to everyone again. This is probably pointless but i guess i needed to do it for myself..

If you read all this.. i’m sorry. this is probably stupid and just depressing and annoying. I’m not good at talking so here i am venting to reddit...

I hope you all have a good day, night or morning wherever you are. stay healthy and take care of yourselves please..
Thank you.",27Dec2019,1

I can’t imagine my life without the people I love but unfortunately my partner of 2 and a half years is leaving me and I don’t want to trap him because I can’t handle the loss. He knows me well enough to know I’ll be a complete wreck so I know it’s hard enough for him as it is.

I don’t know why but when I think about him not being in my life anymore I just feel like something in me has died or like I’m feeling loss as if a death happened. I don’t want to feel this. I can’t put the people around me through the stress of me breaking down again and especially not now- things are difficult. 

I know I can’t get through this unscathed but I just need to know what to do to curb the worst of it so I dont hurt him with my reactions. I don’t want to hurt so bad I go to dark places but I know it’s likely cause I’ve been there before and I don’t have the strength to hide it this time.

 I have a tendency to be too honest with my mental health issues, I suffer from severe depression anywhere from 3-6 months out of the year and then for the remaining 9-6 months I am mildly depressed but never fully content, I guess blah is kind of my normal. I am a creative and I tend to over share, I guess for me it’s a release and a way to hold myself accountable so I don’t commit suicide. But recently I fucked up, I started to believe the narrative in my head was reality and I was experiencing extreme depression and my job which I genuinely hated was starting to become too much for me. I at some point correlated the worsening of my moods with work and eventually quit but not without explaining how unhappy I was to management. Then as I was leaving I posted to my coworkers of my experiences with depression and that I hope they check in with themselves and know they aren’t alone if they experience such symptoms, I even shared resources and hotline numbers in the staff room on my last day.. at the time I thought I was doing something nice to help people feel less alone or that it’s okay to prioritize your mental health and didn’t think about the possibility it could make people uncomfortable or that it was inappropriate for me to inject my own experiences into a workplace culture. But let’s just say someone brought to my attention that it was inappropriate, unhealthy, irresponsible, unprofessional  and it was more about me than the job, I was suddenly flooded with anxiety, doubt, embarrassment and feelings that I was a fucking crazy person who did something really “too much” and didn’t even realize how embarrassing and too much it was. I haven’t felt soo much shame and that I was a mental case until that moment. I cried for 2 days straight and seriously contemplated ending my life. I just couldn’t handle knowing I was perceived as such a loose cannon and ever since I have been experiencing identity issues and I don’t really trust myself to make smart decisions. I just shut down everything and I haven’t really talked to anyone but my sisters and a few friends who struggle too because I am afraid to be too honest with people. At what point does my mental illness and honesty about it discredit me as a person ? I don’t believe the stigma should exist but it does and I need to realize that so I don’t shoot myself in the foot and discredit myself by sharing too many of my truths with the world. Somethings I guess are better left unsaid and I need to find that boundary. I feel like an idiot, I don’t want to be me anymore.",27Dec2019,1

I’ve just been told from another friend that one of our mutual friends took her own life the night between Wednesday and Thursday.

But I didn’t see anything.

the first day i met him. i knew that i liked him. but he was getting with my best mate and i wanted her to be happy so i left it alone. but a few months past and she had decided she was a lesbian and didn’t want to be with him. and he started to show real interest in me. he made me feel happy, safe and comfortable.

the first time i kissed him, it made me feel happier than i had ever felt. we eventually got together. but he didn’t want anyone to know because he was 19 and i was 15 and neither of us wanted anyone to say things about it. he said he didn’t want to have sex until i was 16 which i was completely fine with because tbh i’m not ready for something like that with my current mental state. i’ve been sexually abused multiple times in the past by people i trusted and i had a lot going on.

one night. i explained everything to him. which i won’t go into detail about here but he knew everything about me at this point and he knew everything i was going through and he promised never to hurt me like they had before. 

but then he stopped talking to me. started ignoring me. he was only interested when i wanted to buy weed off him, or i was drunk and he was horny. it’s made me feel like shit and i’m still with him. he’s made me fall for him and i fall way to hard and fast for people and he knew that. i’m scared to leave him and lose any chance of him treating me well and making me happy again. but he’s slowly killing me without realising. i don’t know if i can take the pain of it and i’m heavily considering suicide as a way out. 

i want him to love me. i want him to care about me. like i do him. but i know the chances of that happening are very slim. i miss the way he made me feel. we could talk for hours about each others problems. or about music. or anything. i had never felt better. but it’s different. and i don’t see a way out. and i just want. for once in my life. for someone to genuinely care about me and appreciate me.

it hurts. so fucking bad. and i’m letting it happen. he’s using me. it’s obvious. and once i’m 16 he will probably leave me. i’m scared of what i’m gonna end up doing as a result of this. but i’m more scared of losing him. i wish i never got with him. just stayed friends. because he was one of my best mates and i’ll never get that back.

my mental health has spiralled out of control again. and i’m heavily using drugs and alcohol to cover it up. but i lay at home every night crying my eyes out over him and other issues in my life. and i want it to end. i don’t want to feel like this anymore. i don’t want to keep living",27Dec2019,1

My ex that I’ve been very upset over for 4 months has been lying to me about everything. I was even informed that she regularly refers to me in her discord as a bad boyfriend and crazy.

I was suicidal for a long time and I just got used to having thoughts like this. It felt normal. A few days ago I decided to create a plan to improve my life and I felt a little bit better.

So I decided to commit to living. And I think I can control my suicidal thoughts a bit better.

So for now I just stop my suicidal thoughts and they are getting easier to control. so I need some advice (or articles) to help me retrain my brain sooner.

Sometimes I would write in the journal as if I were talking to two other people, who were named Tinycreeper and Heroteen (I was a fan of Minecraft at the time, and still am). I wrote in there that my emotions changed too quickly, but I don't know if that's just a normal part of adolescence. I switched between being angry at people and then feeling depressed. I'd go from liking this one boy to hating him to being in love with him again. None of the pages have dates but at some point, I did disassociate. I said that I zoned out and forgot who I was and was disoriented once I came to. For some reason, I thought this was a superpower but that was just me being dumb. 

I was also talking online with these people, one who claimed to be insane and also a werewolf named Brian. There was also Kimberly I think, who seemed to have MPD? 

I felt a bit of paranoia and felt like I was being watched later on in the journal. 

At some point, I apparently blanked out and tried to hurt someone? I don't really think I blanked out, but I'm not too sure why I'd do something on purpose like that. Afterwards, I wrote about having amnesia, which i currently understand… i can't remember things very well, so I have to write it down if I want to even try to remember. I began to notice my bodily functions more, like my heartbeat and my breathing. 

At some point, I was convinced that I was possessed. That I was a different being  probably. I began to hear voices, and I guess I thought that it made me like some serial killer or something. Crazy fifth grader delusions. 

Now, the voices, they sound like they're in my head, but they aren't my thoughts. At the time, I thought I was making the voices in my head but I'm not, they aren't my thoughts. 

I decided to name my pens that I used to write in the journal and threatened to stab people with them. 

One particularly depressing thing was when I wrote 'I feel like I'm further from earth every day'

Afterwards, I was depressed again. 

I write occasionally in the book, and I went between thinking that I was anxious and schizophrenic, two VERY different things. I've just wanted some kind of answer.


After fifth grade, in sixth grade, my mother got sick and I had to go with my grandma for a bit and I ended up going to a pretty good school but my mom brought me to her school after winter break and that just… wasn't good. I ended up getting expelled for writing a note?? Apparently I wrote that I wanted to kill someone on it, but I don't believe that I did. However, I cannot remember. 

I ended up having to go to group therapy for three weeks, and I don't remember my diagnosis, but I do remember complaining about disassociating, or specifically, DPDR. I remember being told by the other kids there that I should be somewhere else because I was just too crazy or something like that, and I also remember being put in the padded room. 

I ended up back in the school system that I was in when I was with my grandma, and it was much better for me than the other school system. Still, though, I had some problems. I got suspended in seventh grade for claiming to bring a razor blade (it was a sharpener blade) to school and I think I cut myself during class. 

Eighth grade was fine, but last year was when it got even worse. My auntie kind of just forced me to join a sport, which was Lacrosse, and I was fine with it. Except, sometimes I heard the voices during conditioning. I distinctly remember hearing something tell me about aliens and seeing some sort of imagery in front of me that was related to aliens. Later on, I had to fill out a form to completely be signed up with it, and one of the questions was about mental health. That set me off. I told my mom about the question and then revealed how my mental health really was. She didn't react much though, and I felt very suicidal that night. I ended up going to the hospital the day after.

In the beginning of summer break, I went to the hospital again because I was being delusional and claimed that TC (TinyCreeper) was going to kill me with a space gun and I had a knife in my hand in case it actually happened.

In my current grade, I've been to the hospital twice because I was suicidal. 

It's winter break, and I just got suspended for threatening a teacher, but indirectly. I couldn't control myself. I had a protractor with a really sharp tip and couldn't help but to laugh at the thought of causing harm to the teacher. I… don't think that was me. Apparently, I was shaking and gripping the protractor tightly but I only remember not being able to respond. I don't even know who I am. I disassociate so much… this body isn't mine. I don't know who's it is but it's not mine. The body has a name, but I don't know my own name. I try to assign myself a name, but it usually just feels weird.

Oh! I forget about Kaleb. Kaleb is a voice who I can actually talk to, unlike the other ones who just say nonsense. He's kind of rude but it's funny. The other ones are told to shut up… but I have to call him when I want to talk to him. 

This is all I have to say… uh, ciao! ",27Dec2019,1
113,"I have two very close friends who have both battled with depression and have suicidal tendencies. 

Tonight we were all together and talking about it, they were reflecting on their own struggles and joking about their suicide attempts and thoughts. 

I know this is a coping mechanism and a way to make light of their experiences. I could see they were connecting and relating to each other which seemed really healthy for both. It was nice to see that they both felt heard by each other. 

I feel like sometimes they don’t feel heard by me, because I haven’t experienced that struggle and I can’t find the humour in it because the possibility of losing them and the times we went through where I nearly did lose them were really scary. It feels wrong to laugh with them when the joke is about them ending their own lives. 

.What are your guys tips for this? How should you react when someone is telling their story through humour? How do you want your friends to respond to your stories? 

I want to be a better friend to them both and I want them to feel they can open up to me without me being overbearing or too concerned. I want them to know I hear them.",27Dec2019,1

115,"Today, amidst inelegant tears and sickening sneezes, my mom reminded me that she feels like she is going to go away soon, and that the only thing that matters to her and would give her peace would be to see her children well set in life. It makes me wonder if she actually intends to just wither away as soon as possible, but then I remember that she's just tired. Tired of fighting for me and my brothers, fighting against the world, fighting our fights, living for us.

She is only 55, and I have been 17 for 2 weeks. I'm not ready to hear this type of thing, and I don't want to. I've already got enough mental problems to handle on my own. Things that, if I've shared of the years with her, I did it reluctantly, because at some point I realized I couldn't be a burden to her.

Yesterday, actually, my older half-brother told my mom that he finally understood that he'd been running away from dealing with her and her problems ever since he'd started studying abroad (he did it at age 18, now has 35, a wife and two kids). Her world is crumbling down, and now she also feels like she makes terrible everyone's life, Me and my brother, my father, my half-brother, his dad, her dad, and more even. That, made some of her inner demons surface and today she's just furious and depressed. And once again I feel like anything I do is enough to cure her. Hopeless and symptomatically depressed too.

It was scary how his words made sense to me. Almost like I'd feel the same if I had experienced the good things he did, away from her. I don't want to be like him (and yet, I already feel a little suffocated by my mom, and am really over her overbearing parenting and her attacks and critics every time I talk about living on my own). I don't want to hurt her like that, and I don't want her to feel like I'm abandoning her now that I'm likely going to study to a university, and we'll be a train away from each other.

My mom doesn't think she can fix herself now, either. She, in a way conforming, and I really don't like it. She's furious with my brother, too. I just don't know what to do, Reddit.

TL;DR: As my mom feels like she's living her last years, and looking to see us well set, my older brother tells her he ran away from her negative attitude and problems, and she realizes she fights for her children, only to hurt them for life, pushing them away, and for them not to acknowledge her struggles and sacrifices.",27Dec2019,1

What should I expect and what should I make sure I tell this doctor so that I can be put on the right meds for once because I think I've been misdiagnosed all these years as just depression or anxiety and treated for those things but the meds stop working. I think I actually have bipolar 2.

Today I called in for a FMLA day. I can tell my boss is pissed, which makes things 100% worse. I don’t think she knows the difference between a “Mental health day” and an FMLA day. My anxiety about it is through the roof.

Earlier this year, I was off for 2 months due to a partial hospitalization and an inpatient stint (attempted suicide). Boss was upset and scared that I was ok, but also because she needs me at work.

My career has been stunted because of my mental illness. I was supposed to get my PhD and be a successful psychologist. Now I feel like I’m failing at my shitty backup job.

I’m terrified and depressed because my life is not at all what it is supposed to be. I have a new therapist and a new psychiatrist, and possibly a new diagnosis. It would seem that I should be on an upswing, but I’m still barely scraping by.

120,"My boyfriend claims to be a sociopath. We've been together, living in the same home for two years now. It has been a hell of a rollercoaster the entire time. We've had extreme lows and wonderful beautiful highs together. We both have our share of demons and  we're working through them but it's so hard and frustrating and I feel so alone and empty sometimes.

His arms are painted with very old scars, too many to even try counting. His words are smooth and silky, poetic and charming. He talks of the dark things that normal people would shy away from. The blood and demons, the beautiful violence he wishes. The best way to describe his persona is an old Victorian vampire. Luring beautiful women in, treating them like goddesses, making them his most treasured thing in the world. Even though he has this huge darkness looming overtop of him, he could never bring harm to them.

He takes such wonderful care of me, he is the first to ever treat me like a person. A strong beautiful woman who could conquer the world if I wanted. He takes care of my needs, if it's cold, he makes sure to buy me a coat, if I'm hungry he'll make sure I'm fed. He doesn't spoil me, he just makes sure my needs are met and that I feel loved and wanted.

This period of bliss and wonderfulness went on. We had out first bit of conflict a year into dating. He hadn't even told me we'd broken up. We fought for a month straight. I felt like I was sinking into my depression again. I have many issues, I'm self centered, spoiled, entitled, I don't care about other people or their emotions for the most part. I was diagnosed with agoraphobia and severe depression but dont take medication for my own reasons. When all of this was going on it felt like my world had stopped and I had woken up out of the hazy bubble I was trapped in. It was the first time I'd ever wanted to fight for someone.

I found out that he cheated on me during the ""breakup"". A year later and he still doesn't know I knew about it. I didn't want to lose him. I knew they only did it once and she had no desire of being with him. 

Since then I've been paranoid. I've found him on tinder a few times. Talking his silky poetic words with them, telling them how empty he feels and always leaving out that he has a girlfriend. 

I finally womaned up and told him I knew about tinder. He explained it to me like this:

He has no remorse for what he's done, only that he feels sick and disgusted with himself. He has no desire to be with those women, he just enjoys leading them on, toying with their emotions. He likes the attention they give him because when he's done he can always throw them away. It was the same as when I met him, only he wanted more of me. He wanted to spend time with me and give me more than what he'd give the others. 

I feel like our relationship keeps getting stronger, even through this. But It also could just be that I'm getting better at lying To myself. 

A part of me likes the abuse. I like knowing that even though he was talking to other women, I'm the one by his side. I'm the one he lays with at night, talking of the beautiful house we'll have together. 

How do you live with a sociopath? Can a sociopath really love someone? How do I know he even is a sociopath? He seems to me to be very real, very strong, caring, loving. 

I'm patient, I can wait. I love my job, my home, I love what we have together. I'm willing to work with him and to get past whatever demons he has. I know we all make mistakes, I have my fair share of ample fuck ups. But I can only take so much. Right now I have a clear head. I know he did wrong, and it will take a long time for me to forgive and trust him again.

124,"Asking for myself, an average male teenager, what causes random these super random thoughts about doing horrible things, like homicide, mass killing, or robbing?

I could be sitting at a peaceful dinner with my family with not an ounce of worry and then, boom. There it is, you think to yourself, ""wouldn't it be crazy if you killed someone?"", Or similarly, in class at school with people you don't like, you think to yourself ""wouldn't it be cool if I could shoot some of these people?""

The only reason I bring this up is because all my friends feel the same way, even if they weren't necessarily stressed and don't have any diagnosed mental conditions. It seems to just be a random fleeting thought, and there's never any intention of us ever wanting to actually do any of these things.

And no, none of my family has any diagnosed mental disorders, my dad was a little bit crazy but nothing dangerous.

I was diagnosed with various attention deficit disorders at 8, and was medicated for about a week or two, before my mom took me off due to the horrendous side effects, but also because I was just a kid that acted a little different, and nothing worth throwing hardcore drugs at.

There was no physical abuse but I wouldn't say they gave me a childhood either. I had no friends all through primary (elementary school) and have suffered with suicidal tendansies for years now (I am 16 but was diagnosed with clinical depression in year 7 (I was 11) and noted as suicidal). I grew up obese (145 kg at the highest) but now I have a healthy ish weight of 86 being 6'3"". I have huge self love problems. 
To the point. I have a huge problem with loneliness and feeling isolated. I've made attempts at friendship and only one person reciprocated. She is very friendly and seems half caring. Often I open up (with her permission) about my up bringing, emotions and fears, but it makes me feel bad as I feel like a burden. I think I've carried that since a little kid. I think I have feelings for her but am not sure and don't want to make a move due to my emotional instability atm. I feel very clingy however, like I can't not talk about things with her, and feel very alone with out at least texting her. I don't bombard with messages as in ill only send if we just talked and always wait for responses. I feel empty with out talking to people but the thing is I constantly look for comfort and validation with out being able to as I can't hold down a friendship with out feeling like a burden.

I live near NYC and a cousin of mine just showed up 2 days before Christmas from Georgia. He said he was only going to be in the city for a little bit but he brought all his belongings so it looks like he came prepared to stay. He said he wanted a fresh start in life and wanted to look for jobs in the city. He suffers from OCD, depression, and mood swings. He was on meds for all three but stopped taking them gradually. He recently stopped taking the OCD medication. He doesn’t like taking them. He was getting depressed being alone in Georgia so I guess he figured it needs to be around people.

134,"First of all, let me just say that I appreciate all of you on here. Thank you to those who have tried to help me recently. I do appreciate it.
The thing is though, unless I speak up in real life to someone, can any of this really get better? It just isn't the same as posting on reddit. After every post I make, I just think of how much more beneficial it would be to reach out to someone I actually know. That's where I would really be able to take action to fix this. 
At the same time, I do know why I come on here. I come on here because it's not as scary. Everyone has been kind and supportive. In the real world it might not always be that way. In the real world, opening up shows vulnerability. By opening up to someone in person, their judgement actually matters to you. Whereas on here, if someone says something rude or disapproving you don't actually know them and chances are you won't come in contact with them again, so it doesn't impact you as much. I don't reach out in person because I'm afraid to bother or annoy anyone. I'm too afraid of judgement. I'm too afraid of making things awkward. Certain people in my life have an idea of what's going on, but they don't know the whole truth. They think I'm doing better than I really am. It'll probably stay that way for a while due to all of those reasons above as to why I don't speak up in person.

It all started last weekend when i got to know a girl better i have been talking to for some time.
We spent the whole Saturday together, Sunday morning and Christmas eve. We didn't have sex.
We talked a lot and i think i have fallen in love with her in that time which absolutely terrifies me. Because i feel that im not nearly as desirable as she is to me. But i don't want to dump all of this on her, fearing that she will just dump me before anything really serious starts at all.
I was able to distract myself from it when i was with friends or when i played games with them but only for a short time. 


When i was with her i felt super happy and grounde. As soon as i left her apartment i felt alone. Like there is no one in this world. And i just want it to stop and go back to the way i felt before last Friday. I feel like it's tearing on me.

I honestly thought it was normal...I've gotten pretty used to the negativity in my mind maybe? So anyways I recently sought out counseling and have been on medication for a while. My fiance and I were talking ( we've been together for almost 9 years) and I was describing some recent dreams I have been having and telling him how weird they were etc. Then he tells me that its actually a ""normal"" dream. And it all clicked for me. He said that since hes known me I've never had ""okay"" dreams. I honestly thought that's how it was for everyone(bad dreams) but I've also noticed I don't need my coping mechanism as much either, including when sleeping. I guess this wasn't that short but this is my first post on Reddit.

Two months ago I got put in a room and told that they are not willing to keep me there any longer as they need people to deliver.

It's been weeks since then and I have literally spiralled down a deeper darker hole. I have not found a job still and have no hope of finding one. I'm speaking to recruiters and majority of them end up ignoring me which frustrates me even more.

- intense health-based anxiety ever since I had a scare in summer. Been convinced I have cancer multiple times and I am still showing some minor physical symptoms that may be stress related.

- obsessive and unfounded insecurity in my relationship, which involves obsessing every day about my girlfriend’s past boyfriends and sexual experiences. Even though I know this is irrational, I’ve posted dozens of text posts on Reddit about this, all asking variations of the same few questions. Sometimes in these posts I’ll fantasise and claim I dumped my girlfriend to shame her for her past. I loathe myself for this and try my best never to let it affect me when I am with my girlfriend

- mood swings and the tendency to break down at small inconveniences.

- an intense feeling and fear of letting others down.

- excessive anxiety about family issues, including my ageing mother.

For a year things felt on the up, I generally felt happier and the people around me noticed. But I got to a point where I felt like they were doing nothing, eventually coming off them. Now? I just feel as though I feel zero emotion. I don't feel happy nor do I feel sad, I don't get excited by anything, I just simply feel as though I'm existing. Probably once every other week, something will go wrong, most of the time only something like a minor inconvenience and I'll just think about killing myself, convincing myself one day that's how I'll go.

164,"TL;DR: Got drunk with husband on Christmas, felt overwhelmed by the holiday and his family's expectations, had a fight, his family got involved, and now I feel even more alienated from them.  This is the fourth year in a row.  

I really don't know what triggers it specifically but for the last four years, I've had such a difficult time with making it through Christmas with my husband's family.  Mine lives too far away for us to visit for the holidays.  Things have been financially very tight for us for years also, so it would take a major financial toll on us to go see my family anyhow.  Any celebration with my husband's family ends up involving a lot of alcohol.  There's always around 20 people, minimum, and Christmas is celebrated on Christmas Eve, with everybody staying up until midnight to open presents.  Coming from a different culture, I've felt like I've always been an outsider but it feels even more so like that when my husband and I can't afford to give gifts and instead are obligated to sit through watching everybody else give gifts for a couple of hours late into the night.  All the while, I feel embarrassed about our financial situation and like I'm a guest watching another person's family celebrate the holiday with each other.  My family never was very close during the holidays and as a child, I frequently spent Christmas doing something very similar with my childhood best friend's family.  No matter how much they tried to make me feel like I was a part of things, I was very keenly aware of the fact that I was merely a guest, not family.  

To make matters worse, a couple of my husband's uncles get very argumentative during dinner with me and I struggle to make small talk with the rest of his family.  I don't have much in common with them at all.  This year my husband and I had agreed that if I felt like I needed to leave, we could go.  But the first year this happened, I tried to leave when I started feeling overwhelmed since I thought that was the appropriate thing to do, and my mother in law and sister in law begged me to stay and told me I was breaking up their family and stealing my husband from them.  Needless to say, I was pretty upset by that and so since then, I have tried to make an effort to get through the holiday each year for my husband's sake and really try to enjoy myself, but it's felt harder and harder.  By the point we get to gift opening, I'm exhausted, feel socially depleted, and have had a few of drinks in me.  I don't know what sparks it, but I just start crying for no obvious reason.  And of course, it's right in the middle of everybody opening their gifts, which means everybody is in the room to see it.  So then I feel super embarrassed.  My husband goes with me to another room and asks me what's wrong and asks if I want to leave, but he's followed by my mother in law, with my sister in law eavesdropping from the other room.  My mother in law starts asking what's wrong, which makes me feel even more embarrassed so I ask her to leave me to talk with my husband.  But then my sister in law chimes in and says that I'm bullying their mom and am being disrespectful to his family.  I ask my sister in law to please stay out of it and then my brother in law is also suddenly in the room defending his sister, his mom, AND my husband and now my husband is angry at me for ruining Christmas yet again.  By this point, I feel so upset, embarrassed, cornered, and angry that this is all happening again and all I want is out of it all.  I feel even more alienated from his family now that my husband's immediate family are all involved and like I would prefer to never see them again.  But then the next holiday or family get together comes around and my mother in law begs both me and my husband to be a part of it and I cave.  Since the beginning of October, there has been a birthday party or holiday nearly every weekend.  For me, it's overwhelming.  

I do miss my family dearly every holiday.  I've tried to explain this to them before and that it's hard for me to sit through the celebration with all of them.  That I would rather attend a smaller, more intimate gathering, not stay so late into the night, and that I would like to have time with my husband to make our own traditions since I don't get to split the holidays between my family and his.  His family then tells me that they are my family too and that as long as I'm with my husband, they'll love me and want me to be a part of their family traditions and their culture.  I suppose they were trying to be nice but it doesn't really feel like love if it's conditional and only because of who I'm married to.  But then again, it is HIS family, not mine, so what can I expect.  He's related to them, not me.  I couldn't expect my own family to love my husband as much as I do, nor expect them to love him as much as they love me.  But it does still feel pretty lonely to be married into a large family and not have my own family around to balance it out.  Culturally, his family comes from a collectivistic background and mine is very individualistic, so there's that too.    


Before we even go over to my inlaw's house, I already feel so full of anxiety about making it through the rest of the night that by the time we get there I'm already on the verge of tears.  I don't know what it is specifically that puts me so on edge.  But then somebody hands me a drink, I start to feel like I can relax a little....until I can't.  Then whatever it triggers me again and I'm a blubbering mess.  My husband and I have agreed to be sober around his family going forward because it's obviously become a problem.  But I still feel like I've broken my relationship with my inlaws to a point now where I don't think I'll ever be close to them.  My sister in law is pregnant with the first grandchild and I'm afraid that going forward I'll be expected to be a part of family events even more so than I already am OR I'll end up blacklisting myself due to me becoming a drunken blubbering mess each Christmas.  More than anything, right now I feel extremely embarrassed.  My husband and I have both apologized to his mom and tried to apologize to his sister, but I haven't heard back from his sister.  Am I wrong to think she should apologize also though?  I don't know why she got involved in everything.  I've been actively trying to build a relationship with her and it felt like her getting involved brought us right back to the first fight we had.  I felt extremely hurt that she would immediately jump in and assume I was trying to bully their mom.  Honestly, I'm not sure where that assumption came from.  When my husband and I were first engaged, we lived with his mom for two years and I thought I had gotten quite close to her.  But as soon as my sister in law and brother in law get involved, it immediately feels like three against one and like there is no way I can get them to understand how I'm feeling.  

  
I really don't know what to do going forward about dealing with being around my husband's family.  I don't want to take medication for anxiety because I really don't think I have generalized anxiety disorder, it's more situational.  I've had problems with depression in the past and have taken medication for it, but I hated how numb I felt.  I'm a strong believer in finding alternative ways to cope.  I'm currently a Ph.D. student (ironically I study psychology) and am under a lot of pressure due to that, in addition to financial strain, and now problems with my inlaws.  But since this keeps happening, it's making me think that maybe I need to do something about my anxiety and maybe talking to my doctor might help.",27Dec2019,1
165,"Hope you’re all having a nice day, I just felt the need to write this, please excuse any grammar/spelling mistakes I make. 
Just a little background information: I’m 15, female, I’ve been depressed before

For the past few years I’ve noticed I’ve been getting depressed/unmotivated around the winter months, and yeah it sucks but I’ve gotten through it. However, for the past 6/7 months I’ve been getting these horrible mood swings and they only seem to keep getting worse. One second I’ll be pretty content with life and out of nowhere I’ll be in this dark space and all I want to do is die. Sometimes they last 10 minutes, other times they’ll last over an hour and even happen multiple times a day. It’s gotten to the point where I can’t enjoy my happy moments in fear that I’ll get really sad again. I started out the school year strong but I have no motivation to do well in school anymore and it’s like it doesn’t even matter anymore even though deep inside I know it does. And I feel like I have no reason to complain because my life has been pretty good in comparison to most people. I just want to get out of my head. Feeling like this all the time is exhausting and I don’t know how to express my emotions or talk to people. I mean I’ve tried talking to my dad but I can’t explain it very well because half the time I’m not even sure what’s going on in my mind and it just comes off as laziness to him. Also I seem to not be able to keep up with the workload at school because I am always getting distracted so I just put it off till the last minute but when break comes around I don’t know what to do with my life and I’m just left alone with my thoughts and things get bad. (I’ve been waking up past 2:00pm which makes matters worse) 
When I’m at my low points I try to get my mind off of it and watch Netflix or use social media but I’m tired of relying on something else to make me feel better if I know it’s only going to be temporary if that makes sense.

For individuals with OCD, body dysmorphia, or many other mental illnesses, the emphasis put on dieting and exercise could increase the likelihood of the development of disordered eating habits.  Furthermore, the people who talk about doing cleanses or fasting or taking extreme measures to lose weight could make others begin to question their own appearances.  Please be cautious about who you discuss your goals with, and make sure that if you have children or individuals around you that are particularly impressionable, they understand that you are working to become healthy instead of just thinner.  Also, if you have a friend or family member with a history of disordered eating of any kind, please be cautious when approaching subjects such as weight loss or dieting.  These can be triggering conversations for some.  Finally, let me just say that if you are struggling with an eating disorder or have in the past, please be mindful when it comes to making a resolution related to your physical health.  Collaborate with a doctor or nutritionist or anyone with an understanding of your current or past disorder before you decide to make changes to your food and exercise routines.  It is great to have goals for the new year, but please make sure that these goals are safe and healthy.

Enjoy the rest of your holidays  :)",27Dec2019,1
168,"TL;DR: Got drunk with husband on Christmas, felt overwhelmed by the holiday and his family's expectations, had a fight, his family got involved, and now I feel even more alienated from them.  This is the fourth year in a row.

I really don't know what triggers it specifically but for the last four years, I've had such a difficult time with making it through Christmas with my husband's family.  Mine lives too far away for us to visit for the holidays.  Things have been financially very tight for us for years also, so it would take a major financial toll on us to go see my family anyhow.  Any celebration with my husband's family ends up involving a lot of alcohol.  There's always around 20 people, minimum, and Christmas is celebrated on Christmas Eve, with everybody staying up until midnight to open presents.  Coming from a different culture, I've felt like I've always been an outsider but it feels even more so like that when my husband and I can't afford to give gifts and instead are obligated to sit through watching everybody else give gifts for a couple of hours late into the night.  All the while, I feel embarrassed about our financial situation and like I'm a guest watching another person's family celebrate the holiday with each other.  My family never was very close during the holidays and as a child, I frequently spent Christmas doing something very similar with my childhood best friend's family.  No matter how much they tried to make me feel like I was a part of things, I was very keenly aware of the fact that I was merely a guest, not family.

To make matters worse, a couple of my husband's uncles get very argumentative during dinner with me and I struggle to make small talk with the rest of his family.  I don't have much in common with them at all.  This year my husband and I had agreed that if I felt like I needed to leave, we could go.  But the first year this happened, I tried to leave when I started feeling overwhelmed since I thought that was the appropriate thing to do, and my mother in law and sister in law begged me to stay and told me I was breaking up their family and stealing my husband from them.  Needless to say, I was pretty upset by that and so since then, I have tried to make an effort to get through the holiday each year for my husband's sake and really try to enjoy myself, but it's felt harder and harder.  By the point we get to gift opening, I'm exhausted, feel socially depleted, and have had a few of drinks in me.  I don't know what sparks it, but I just start crying for no obvious reason.  And of course, it's right in the middle of everybody opening their gifts, which means everybody is in the room to see it.  So then I feel super embarrassed.  My husband goes with me to another room and asks me what's wrong and asks if I want to leave, but he's followed by my mother in law, with my sister in law eavesdropping from the other room.  My mother in law starts asking what's wrong, which makes me feel even more embarrassed so I ask her to leave me to talk with my husband.  But then my sister in law chimes in and says that I'm bullying their mom and am being disrespectful to his family.  I ask my sister in law to please stay out of it and then my brother in law is also suddenly in the room defending his sister, his mom, AND my husband and now my husband is angry at me for ruining Christmas yet again.  By this point, I feel so upset, embarrassed, cornered, and angry that this is all happening again and all I want is out of it all.  I feel even more alienated from his family now that my husband's immediate family are all involved and like I would prefer to never see them again.  But then the next holiday or family get together comes around and my mother in law begs both me and my husband to be a part of it and I cave.  Since the beginning of October, there has been a birthday party or holiday nearly every weekend.  For me, it's overwhelming.

I do miss my family dearly every holiday.  I've tried to explain this to them before and that it's hard for me to sit through the celebration with all of them.  That I would rather attend a smaller, more intimate gathering, not stay so late into the night, and that I would like to have time with my husband to make our own traditions since I don't get to split the holidays between my family and his.  His family then tells me that they are my family too and that as long as I'm with my husband, they'll love me and want me to be a part of their family traditions and their culture.  I suppose they were trying to be nice but it doesn't really feel like love if it's conditional and only because of who I'm married to.  But then again, it is HIS family, not mine, so what can I expect.  He's related to them, not me.  I couldn't expect my own family to love my husband as much as I do, nor expect them to love him as much as they love me.  But it does still feel pretty lonely to be married into a large family and not have my own family around to balance it out.  Culturally, his family comes from a collectivistic background and mine is very individualistic, so there's that too.

Before we even go over to my inlaw's house, I already feel so full of anxiety about making it through the rest of the night that by the time we get there I'm already on the verge of tears.  I don't know what it is specifically that puts me so on edge.  But then somebody hands me a drink, I start to feel like I can relax a little....until I can't.  Then whatever it triggers me again and I'm a blubbering mess.  My husband and I have agreed to be sober around his family going forward because it's obviously become a problem.  But I still feel like I've broken my relationship with my inlaws to a point now where I don't think I'll ever be close to them.  My sister in law is pregnant with the first grandchild and I'm afraid that going forward I'll be expected to be a part of family events even more so than I already am OR I'll end up blacklisting myself due to me becoming a drunken blubbering mess each Christmas.  More than anything, right now I feel extremely embarrassed.  My husband and I have both apologized to his mom and tried to apologize to his sister, but I haven't heard back from his sister.  Am I wrong to think she should apologize also though?  I don't know why she got involved in everything.  I've been actively trying to build a relationship with her and it felt like her getting involved brought us right back to the first fight we had.  I felt extremely hurt that she would immediately jump in and assume I was trying to bully their mom.  Honestly, I'm not sure where that assumption came from.  When my husband and I were first engaged, we lived with his mom for two years and I thought I had gotten quite close to her.  But as soon as my sister in law and brother in law get involved, it immediately feels like three against one and like there is no way I can get them to understand how I'm feeling.

I really don't know what to do going forward about dealing with being around my husband's family.  I don't want to take medication for anxiety because I really don't think I have generalized anxiety disorder, it's more situational.  I've had problems with depression in the past and have taken medication for it, but I hated how numb I felt.  I'm a strong believer in finding alternative ways to cope.  I'm currently a Ph.D. student (ironically I study psychology) and am under a lot of pressure due to that, in addition to financial strain, and now problems with my inlaws.  In fact, I should be studying for a major exam I take in a couple of weeks but I've been so stressed, I can't focus.  Since this keeps happening, it's making me think that maybe I need to do something about my anxiety and maybe talking to my doctor might help.  And that we definitely need to stop drinking around my inlaws.",27Dec2019,1

172,"I just can't.  I've been thinking about what to do if I move away.  I would never dare say it to them, my kom and step dad.  I would hide behind someone who works with these kind of issues and hope they can take care of everything.  I wouldn't dare look my parents in the eye not to mention even talking to them.  I just want someone to do it for me because I'm a fucking coward.  Because it feels like most of the time everything is ok, so it gets exaggerated if I want to change things just for that.  People have it really bad, who have parents who are addicts or fight all the time.  For me the majority of the time it's ok.  At least I thought so, but they have to go on eggshells all the time, so probably everything is not ok.  So then it's something wrong with me.  I'm just an attention seeker, because I react like this over minor things.  It's not as if we fight so often, but every time it feels like they go further and further across the line.  But then am i the one who puts the line so damn low? and everything is just in my damn head!? 

Short on the situation : my biological dad is an alcoholic, I live with mom and her bf. I'm 15. My step dad has ""threatened"" me multiple times that he would have me moving out and in with my dad. both my dad and mom are very manipulative, and this time my step dad almost broke the light in my room (he threw the lamp into the wall) and then proceeded to curse at me and make sure how horrible I am as a person and that everything is my fault and that I'm ruining their lives. If I have to put in my own word, I am not a rebellious teen, I do chores at home and try to keep my good grades, at the same time as I have a lot of mental struggles. But if you ask my mom's bf, only spoiled brats have mental problems. And I am one of those disgusting people",27Dec2019,1

I have Xanax, which was prescribed to me about 6 months ago and I was told to take it only when I'm feeling an extreme amount of anxiety. I take 20mg of paroxetine daily, as prescribed most recently in November.

175,"It nearly feels trivial to write this as I'm not going through anything nearly as bad as most people on this sub, I'm just confused as to why I'm in this situation. Would love some advice on how to get on with things... 

From 2014 to 2018 I had some incredibly good years in college. There were stresses of course but I had a great time, made great friends and came out with a great degree. Right after college, I moved to a different continent with a few friends and started a new normal life and got a regular 9-5 job. 

These days though, I feel utterly bored with this normal life. The thing is, I've got a good job, I have a huge group of close friends both here and at home that really like me, I make decent money, I have hobbies and interests galore and I'd consider myself a smart enough guy. I do fun shit with my friends regularly and when it comes to girls, I'd think of myself as a catch... no deep insecurities there. 

The problem is that, within the past year, everything has lost its sheen a bit. I used to love dating and sleeping around but now I don't at all. I used to find it so easy to become passionate with everything I do to the point that I resonated positive energy and now I just don't. I now find myself doing so much of what I used to love with such unenthusiasm. 

On top of all this I've been sleeping terribly and rarely sleep through the night. A relevant point is that I drink very heavily around twice a week and find that my sleep cycle and mood are badly affected after a big weekend. Another new thing is that I'm mad anxious regularly over what I know is pretty much nothing, but I'm not able to control it at all. I've never had suicidal thoughts and I know life is unreal, I'm just having a hard time feeling it rn. 

In the grand scheme of things I've nothing at all to be worried about, I know deep down that I'm a cool guy and I'm hard pressed to find someone I don't vibe well with. I just don't know why I'm feeling this way. Have any of you ever gone through anything similar? 

I don't know if there are some possible physiological causes for this rather than it being a solely mental thing, but my diet is great and I exercise semi regularly (muai thai 2x week and love hiking). Could it be related to sort of food allergy/inflammation? 

I could write all day here but I'll stop here. If you've any questions about my life, just ask. Cheers reddit",27Dec2019,1
176,"What is the purpose of life. Like honestly no bs like “to live for the moments” no what is MY purpose. What could I do to make anything better in the world. The long and short of it is nothing I can do will make a difference. The purpose of my life is to exist, take up resources, take up people’s time, annoy people. Then eventually die. 

Why bother than with living if I’m not going to contribute anything and eventually just die anyways. I’m not going to take any actions on these thoughts. 
But they are genuine thoughts I have and if anyone here ever finds out who I am then I won’t be able to have my dream job so I can’t give specifics on my life.
Just what’s the point. 

I’m going to be forgotten within the fifty years after my death. So what’s the point?
Why bother doing anything I’m a nobody and nothing can change that, there’s no reason for my existence and there’s no reason for me to bother doing anything. 
Every-time I find something I really enjoy there’s always one thing that annoys me about it and causes me to stop enjoying it at all and question why I liked it to begin with. 

I don’t have a reason to live and I’m a husk of a human being, everything beautiful in my life was taken away besides one.

177,"Disclaimer: This is NOT a troll post or a joke, so please take it seriously. Thank you for reading. 

So I haven't dated or had sex in a few years now because I have the urge to eat women and I don't want to act on it. What started out as a casual interest in serial killer documentaries has morphed into an unhealthy desire to copy the things that cannibalistic serial killers like Jeffrey Dahmer and Albert Fish did. I'm no stranger to healthy relationships either - I've dated some wonderful ladies, with each relationship lasting multiple months/years. It was a privilege to learn and grow with all of these women, none of them were ever abusive or cruel towards me, and I always strived to be an absolute gentleman towards them :). 

I think something is psychologically wrong with me though. I grew up with a mom who constantly called me ugly, stupid, worthless, and every other insult under the sun, who would throw things at me and tell me these things since I was a toddler. She would dump my toys out all over the floor and scream at me to pick them up, telling me I was a piece of crap that should get out of her face, she'd say she never wanted to see me again and that she was going to kill herself (she never did), etc. She ended up running a meth den in our house, dealing drugs, stealing, and working as a prostitute. The point I'm trying to make is that I wonder if these childhood experiences have shaped my subconscious outlook towards women. I'm in my early 20s now, and apparently the average serial killer begins harming people around age 28. I DO NOT want to end up doing that. Life is precious, and I care about people too much to follow through with my urges. I just worry that I won't be able to control myself in the future.

Lastly, I really want to go to therapy, but I'm afraid that I'll get involuntarily hospitalized, which I can't financially afford at all. I just dont know what to do and I'm hoping maybe someone out there has been in a similar situation and can offer some advice. It doesn't even have to be cannibal related, you could be a pyromaniac or a kleptomaniac or something.

179,"I remember how it felt like to feel, Happy, sad, Anger, Anxiety, ect.

But even the Negative thoughts that once told me I'd be better off dead dont effect me anymore and have ceased entirely along with positive emotion or emotion in general.

Theres no trama, Or stress, or anything big that could've done something (it could just be five years of unattended Suicidal thoughts and depression, but would that do anything like this?)

But I've slowly forgotten how to feel things, I first noticed it when I stopped feeling happy (but I can still laugh even though I feel nothing along with it?!?!)

Then it was The Anger fading, And I thought oh cool! I'm chill as hell. (Lmao nope)

Then it was the Ability to care about nearly anything (Grades, Appearances, Friends personal lives which I've always been passionate about Helping with.)
And I started panicking slightly, But then eventually that faded and I felt nearly empty.

Then away went the ability to feel sad, I haven't been able to cry for about a month, even when My brother punched me really hard on accident ( we were fucking around because we were bored and I wasnt really paying attention and yeah) 
It hurt like hell and I still couldnt cry!

It feels like I'm on auto pilot and I know something's wrong, My gut is screaming at me that something is wrong, it's the only thing my body can focus on without distraction. So does A.)

181,"I've dealt with mental illness for almost my entire life. It got bad enough in middle school that I had to repeat grade seven (which did wonders for my self-esteem /s). Then it got much better in high school, where it seems I peaked. I was a straight-A+ student, president of multiple clubs, liked/respected by most of my peers and teachers, and was voted most likely to become Prime Minister for senior superlatives. People thought I was going to be really successful and, for the first time in my life, I did as well. Then I went to university and my mental health got worse than it has ever been. I found out that, in addition to the anxiety/social anxiety and depression I was already aware of, I also have borderline personality disorder and obsessive compulsive personality disorder (plus some learning disabilities). It has now been seven years since I started undergrad, and I'm still trying to get through it. I don't even know if I'll finish my degree this school year. And even if I do finish one day, I don't think I'll ever be able to manage a full-time job. And if I can't manage a full-time job, I'll never be able to afford to support myself because I live in a ridiculously expensive area (near Toronto, Ontario) and can't move somewhere more affordable without leaving my family/support system, which would likely make my mental health even worse.

I can't help but feel like when people are being abusive, maybe they're reacting in a way that makes sense. I get really sucked into trying to understand where they're coming from. Maybe I did something wrong and they're reacting to me. People can be very sure in their mindset and it makes me feel like they could be right?
