1,"I\`ve always had a big issue with getting over things I\`ve done in the past, even if other people tell me that things are okay and that they\`re not a big deal. 

This time, my guilt comes from my Freshman year of college--currently I\`m a Sophomore. 

Last year, I sort of whored around I guess. I broke up with my highschool boyfriend a month into the year (things just weren't  working out) and barely a few weeks later I slept with another guy. A month or two after that, I slept with another guy. I hooked up with two more guys. I was raped that year as well, I\`m not counting that as a part of my whoring around--just a consequence of my bad decition making I guess. 

I put myself in some situations that I shouldn't have been in and I\`m just really beating myself up about everything despite knowing I can\`t go back and change anything. 

In highschool I was good, I struggled a lot with home life- particularly with my Dad (side question-- does anyone think maybe thats why i went off and slept with a bunch of guys? To me I just wanted attention I think, but I just wasn\`t in the right mind and felt like thats where I could get it). I got to college and I just don\`t know what happened to me.

I\`ve recently got into a relationship with a long time friend who i\`ve always kind of had feelings for. He actually appreciates me and cares for me and isn\`t just around for sex. But now I can\`t help but feel horrible for how i treated myself last year, i deserve more than what i gave myself and i don\`t know what i was thinking. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like a bad person for everything i did, it was so self destructive but I just can\`t get over it.",23Apr2019,1
2,"I had a meeting last week with three therapists at my college. It was about how they could help me when I am in a crisis, what they consider a crisis vs what I think is a crisis, learned about boundaries, and what I can do for myself. Anyway, they said if I express I am suicidal, they will just call the cops. I learned I cannot trust them to keep that to themselves. I tried to kill myself two weeks ago and I didn't call them for help. Instead, I got distracted because I had to use the bathroom, and then I found something else to do afterwards. I learned I cannot trust therapists or anyone in the mental health system. I did end up going to a walk-in crisis center to talk to someone a few hours after; they didn't think I needed to go inpatient, so I went home and bought pizza for dinner. I'm now stable on my medications and doing well.",23Apr2019,3

4,"Excuse my writing.

I've been struggling with mental health issues for a while - anxiety and depression - but I have ""attacks every so often and I'm just wondering if anyone knows what they could be?
Every so often (most recently was last month I think) I very suddenly get in a very bad mood. I feel extremely sad and angry and overall depressed. I don't see any reason for this usually. I have a good day and then later on I have a big low. When I get this ""low"" I can usually feel it coming so I take myself upstairs to the bathroom, away from my family. When I reach the bathroom I'm ready to cry and just collapse to my knees as soon as I lock the door. As I'm having this ""attack"" I usually cry, feel like screaming, hit my legs with my fists, shake, scratch my face with my nails, bite my knuckles/ palm, rock back and forth and feel a massive urge to hit myself in the head (which I stop myself from doing as I'm scared of hurting myself too much), all while bawling my eyes out and insulting myself in my mind. (Sorry that's so long). I do this for a few seconds, then stop for another second and go completely emotionless- this gives me time to wipe my face- then it goes back to the awful feelings. This probably goes on for about 5 to 10 minutes until I become mentally and physically drained so I just get up in my emotionless state, clean myself up, walk to bed and either cry a bit more or just sleep. The following morning I'm either depressed or completely fine as if it never happened.
I was thinking this could be a nervous breakdown or something along those lines but I'm not so sure now..
Could someone help me?



Thanks.",23Apr2019,1
5,"I was in Uni, first year, Autumn term. I had decided to finally finish it all. The method was going to be painkillers and sleeping tablets, lots of them, each in the 100s. I already had a couple of packets of each, but needed much more. It was around 8pm at night when I decided to action it. I walked into town and visited every shop selling those two types of drugs, from large supermarkets to small off licenses. I went to around 7 or 8 shops, until I had roughly 10 packets of the highest strength ‘off the shelf’ painkillers (buying the max of two packets in each shop). In a couple of shops I brought the sleeping tablets. Although it probably would not have raised any suspicion, I never brought the pain killers and sleeping tablets together. The drugs themselves were a mix of aspirin and ibuprofen, liquid capsules and pills. The sleeping tablets were the herbal ones, I only had these to make sure I remained asleep, rather than for anything else. I also brought a 500ml bottle of Ribena original. I came back to the Uni around 10pm. I went to my room and got a notebook and pen out and wrote a note covering all the people I wanted to ‘speak’ to. I left that on the desk. I turned on my laptop, put in my headphones, went to YouTube and played Aphex Twin’s song ‘Film’, the video accompanying it was a mix of UFO videos. I emptied some of the drug packets out, putting them on the bed next to me. I began to take them, three, four, five at a time (painkillers mixed with sleeping tablets) with the Ribena. 

Within five minutes I had gone through roughly three packets of pain killers and two of sleeping tablets. I emptied more packets on to the bed. By this time I was finding it hard to swallow the pills, so I only took one or two at a time. The Ribena ran out so I got some water. Another ten minutes another three or so packets of pain killers and a packet of sleeping tablets. I stopped for a while, maybe ten minutes that I can only describe as being lost. I took another two packets of pain killers. In total I’d taken around 8 or 9 packets of pain killers and around 3 packets of sleeping tablets. This totalled around 250 painkillers and about 60 sleeping tablets. I got under the sheets in bed and rested. I took another packet of painkillers, bringing my total pill intake to around 270. After a while I began to feel sleepy so took out the headphones and turned off the laptop (Aphex Twin had been playing the whole time). I eventually fell asleep. 

I woke up at some point, I believe it was a few hours later. I felt so sick sand nauseous, I went straight to the sink in my bedroom and threw up, constantly threw up. It was a dark brown, almost black colour and full of a material I can only describe as resembling newspaper if it got wet, slightly translucent shards of material. There was no food as I had not eaten all day. I was sick for a good few minutes straight. I also had a blinding headache so sat on the floor where I either went to sleep or passed out. I woke up hours later to the sun coming through my window and the sound of my flat mates chatting in the kitchen. My head felt like I’d finished off the contents of a pub all by myself the night before and my nose had been bleeding.

I stayed in the flat that day, missed lectures. I cooked a late lunch and went to sleep in the early evening. The next day I was doing the same old routine again, back to ‘normal’.

And that’s what I did.",23Apr2019,15

I just want to stop feeling, stop caring so I can finally fkn rest. I can’t explain how physically exhausting it is constantly thinking about everything, overanalysing the littlest things, being in a constant battle with myself and the way my brain works. I just want to chill. How can I stop it from making shitty scenarios that I think about so much that I start to believe they’re true? I’m not crying for attention but please, I want someone to understand. I just want to be able to speak to someone who knows this feeling.

8,"I've always believed that you learn most when your listening, so I need advice. I'm not sure if this is something that people do alot on this subreddit but I feel like I will be judged for talking to people I know. I think I'm too proud to let people I care about hear my struggles so this is how I'm going to get it out. 

I'm 15, male, and I don't have depression or anything but things at home have become increasingly harder.

 My stepdad and I have been becoming increasingly distant, which I don't know if I like. I hate everything about him, so when he goes many days without even talking to me it's not bad. But for see reason whenever I hear his voice or see him, I just want to explode. The anger has been getting a lot worse and I still feel that if I tell him how I feel, he won. If he knows what I think that means he has gotten to me, and it makes me feel like I need his approval to feel better. I feel like there's something wrong with me, but I can't get to the root of it. I try and calm myself down by taking my mind off it, but my mind seems tethered to hatred no matter what I try. I tried weed for a bit but after reading, I think it was only covering up the anger so I stopped. 

I say all this because I just want to know what's wrong with me, what should I do? I know I can't change him but I want to know if there's something I can do to help me.

9,"I have a step brother whose 25 (im 23), He has schizophrenia. As far as ive noticed almost any of his thoughts they seem to be paranoia about being stolen from. He will here music and flip out because Pink Floyd or whoever stole his song and recorded it or hes convinced someone who owed him money 10 years ago needs to pay it back. 


He has a history of extreme violence though he never gets there with me (i have experience de-escelating aggression in others). His only support outside of me is his dad (his mom and my dad ran off years ago) but his dad has to kick him out weekly because of being drunk or making threats (he tried to kill him with a chainsaw once so he understandably prioritizes the safety of his own household. His friends are the local homeless population and drug addicts (nothing against addicts, just dont want my schizophrenic brother doing more drugs). He himself, is hooked on percoset, zopiclone, coke and alcohol. Ive gotten him ""clean"" multiple times (most recently after a bad OD). When he is ""clean"" he stays at his dads house/works on the farm and hangs out with me to chat about once or twice a week. Eventually though he has one to many beer and gets drunk, then he does other stupid shit (threats, belligerence) and his dad tosses him out. He'll usually text me a ""whats up?"" when this happens but im often busy and if i dont get to him the day he gets kicked out he goes on a binger until he eventually makes his way to my place and crashes one night and i get him to agree to go make up with his dad the next morning, rinse and repeat.


 I try and get him out hiking and doing stuff outdoors when hes with me and i only let him have a few beers if im with him and monitoring how its affecting him and were being active. I warn against him getting drunk and limit it as much as i can (he refuses to not have some casual crutch and i cant really control a grown man). I dont let him do drugs around me (Ive even threatened local dealers to get them away from him but theres always more) Ive convince him to quit before but eventually the voices get to him and hes back at it. He doesnt talk about his schizophrenia (beyond confirming its a hard thing he has to deal with). Hes also had horrible experiences with therapy as our city has an asylum and his mom used to put him in their forcibly for 2-8 months and then leave the country and forget about him (seriously, shes a trash human being) then since he doesnt want to be in there the second they arent able to hold him any longer he goes straight to a dealers house and refuses to go back to any pshycologists/therapists. Last time he O.D.'d i got him to agree to take a consult with a social worker and a psychologist in exchange for me not telling his mom (i wouldnt anyways as shes unhelpful, cruel and doesnt live in the country but whatever i used the card) and agreeing not to admit him (not something i can do anyways) and he even stayed clean for like 3 weeks but never went to either referral despite me hounding him on it. I dont know what to do as its hard for me to recognize where he is at any given moment as hes a closed book with the pschizophrenia. I can imagine its alienating (i have OCD and some of my obsessions would be difficult to talk about for similar reasons) so i try and just provide a place where he can just ""be"" without judgement. I ignore it when he chuckles at the voices and i let him mouth off about whatever is bothering him and dont give him any judgement or try to analyze anything he says which seems to do good in terms of making him be at ease and come down from whatever delusion hes on and feel comfortable in the moment. 


Occasionally the only thing i have tried is pointing out (in calm non-judgemental questions) flaws in his theories when hes failing to seperate reality from the delusion. 
So for example, last time he brought up how ""the Who"" stole the lyrics of ""Pinball Wizard"" from him i said, ""what?  really? when did they record it?"" to which he responded ""1969"" without skipping a bit and then started going on about how ""back in the 60's, he was hanging out with..."" then i nicely asked him to remind me what year he was born in to which he responded 92' and i watched him dart his eyes a couple times, shake his head and drop the whole thing, then i just made a comment about how even if they somehow stole the song then thats probably a good thing because their ""cover"" sounds really nice and became an iconic song to which he agreed and then asked me about going to get food. 


Now i dont know if that is how i am /am not supposed to handle him talking delusions but i found getting him to pause, analyze the logic, realize something was up, move on pulled him out of at least that instance of delusion and its kinda how i approach my obsessions with OCD so its the only thing i could think off. 
 

Im aware schizophrenia can present in wildy different ways but where i cant ask him about it (without making him uncomfortable) i was just hoping someone here could give me some general information on helping keeping his time with me as a positive for his own mental health as possible as well as any ideas on bridging the gap of understanding or methods i can use to bring him down when hes riding the thoughts.


Ive considered talking who his dad but my dad stole his wife so he's a bit tense with me. I also have my own psychologist but we have enough stuff to deal with though i think i will ask her for some pointers too. If anyone with pschizophrenia (medicated and ""under control"") would like to have a dialogue with me to inform me and correct anything i might be doing wrong id appreciate it.

extra context: 
My girlfriend is an RN at the local hospital and helps keep an eye on him. 
He got schizophrenia from pill popping with his mom as a young teen (like i said before, shes trash). 
We've been stepbrothers for 5 years and close for 3. 
He cant work as hed lose funding for his meds which cost more than he could make minimum wage. 
He has his own apartment in a big low-income apartment building run by a slum-lord with people O.D.ing in the halls (the only place a social worker could find that he could afford). 
I have a 5 year old who hes AMAZING with but i cant have him live with me long term because i dont have a spare room. 
Hes obsessed with cats and im trying to get him one so he has a daily responsibility to keep him grounded.
He (we?) has an uncle who is a confirmed serial killer (out of prison now as hes old af) that he loves (i hate him along with the rest of the city and do everything i can to block him from going out to the neighbouring town where he lives) and im afraid normalizes some really scary/crazy shit for him.
I smoke weed and he knows but luckily its the one drug hes got little to no interest in anymore as he knows it makes him worse.

If im doing something wrong, call me out on it. if im doing literally anything right let me know as im really lost here and im desperate to make my bro have a semi-functional life as we're getting older and bumming around the street doing drugs and yelling at people isn't anyway to live and im worried if he goes too far AWOL he could kill someone or himself.",23Apr2019,2
10,"I am two weeks from graduating Highschool. I felt pretty good about it until five days ago. I am an atheist (Whole family is). But I believe in reincarnation. I see everything in the universe as an endless cycle, I don't see how life and death aren't the same. However... My first memories was of a nightmare of me being dead. Trapped in a void with no physical self for what felt like an enternity. Then I woke up and I didn't know who I was or what anything was; I had to relearn everything. I suffered from that vision until 5th grade (In middle school I was bullied alot for being autistic so it was pushed out of my mind). These last four years have been my best though, I have this beautiful caring girlfriend who has been with me for three years and my grades are better; people don't even bother me anymore (I began working out just to make sure I would rather intimidate them). 

Though now the terror is back, in seized me at night after some mouth surgery. At first I thought it was the pain medicine inducing it. But now I realized what I am remembering. I believe life is about making your own purpose, enjoying it like you want... But this dread that looms on me confronts my long held belief. My rational brain wants to deny reincarnation as a selfish fantasy. I read biocentrism to calm me down (I hadn't heard of it before) but its relief was only temporary.

- Twitching my legs and hands
- Heavy breathing
- Avoiding people

- Curling into a ball
- Hiding in small cramped spaces (often a pantry)
- Discussing things to myself in my head.

- Avoidance
- Tapping feet, legs and fingers in repeated rhythms
- Breathing fast
- Slamming arms against tables aggressively
- Ramming legs into walls
- Quivering lips 
- Intertwining fingers, hands, arms, legs, feet, toes.
- Very strong blush
- Cracking knuckles and toes
- Putting hands into fists
- Pinching myself
- Urges to stab myself
- Stabbing myself with pencils
- Feeling like I am not in my body (very consistent)

30,"I don't really know how to keep this brief so apologies if I ramble.

I met my current partner in an MMO 3.5 years ago and for 2.5 years of that we've been in a relationship. During this time we've basically done all the things together in the game and he's always insisted he enjoys it and enjoys being with me. In the near future however he's joining another group that has no space for me. He didn't think of me, he doesn't care that I'm really upset at being abandoned. The other group is aware of me and when they asked him if it was an issue leaving me behind, he said no and didn't bat an eyelid.

I'm distraught. I've tried talking with him about it until I'm blue in the face but he just refuses to have a scenario exist where I do get to play with him. It's silly, it shouldn't matter so much but it's sending my mental health to levels if I've never experienced where I'm constantly having panic attacks, am crying and just can't sleep (it's 4am right now). I've known this experience with him our whole relationship and he's abandoning it without a care.

I just can't do it. My mind is always freaking out and I've even had sick days from work and have had panic attacks while AT work over it. He's fully aware of everything and still refuses to adjust.

I keep wanting to run away and just curl up on my own and go back to being introverted and a hermit but he's helped so much over the years to bring me away from that lifestyle. All I want is that single aspect to go on.

I'm sorry for the ramble, I'm aware aspects are better suited for a relationships subreddit but given I'm diagnosed with anxiety and depression and they're skyrocketing because of this, I figured I'd come here.

I'm 16m and live with my father. Hes a hardworking, genuinely good person and I'm happy to be with him currently, but hes a hardass. Tiny mistakes blown out of proportion. I have a couple really closer friends and am of decent standing at my school. 

I have two other things that may be of note: I'm one of those people that never study and ace every test, however I often cant bring myself to do basic tasks, down from just doing the 5 minute homework assignment to making my morning coffee. I'm regularly late to school (something I'm actively cutting back on) simply for not wanting to get out of bed until it's 7:40 and I have to be there in 10. 

My grades have gone down the toilet because of this,  and in a week my report card will be here and I'll lose everything for probably the rest of the school year. Won't change a damn thing, he knows that and has done it before.

I've tried to tell him that I'm probably depressed several times before, but he wont listen, saying that I'm just ""lazy"" and ""spend too much time on that phone"".

I dont know what to do. I cant fix myself if constantly denied the opportunity. I live in a place where even if I could go get treatment on my own, I wouldn't be able to get to it (live in a very rural small town, have to wait 6 months to get my license.)

I don't need to be yelled at every morning at 6:30 about something I didn't turn in 2 weeks ago.   She also brings up my grades even when the they are completely irrelevant to what I'm doing.  For example, when my mom yells at me about not picking up my clothes she goes into a rant about other things I've done wrong.   The overall grade for the class my mom keeps yelling at me about is a 75.6% and by no means is it great but it's definitely not an F or a D.  My mom is an authoritarian parent and she will never stop yelling at me because she's the parent and she's always right.

36,"So i found a landscaping company close by me and got the job today. It does more up scale work for very wealthy clients. No grass cutting more like mulch and garden work under a lead herbaculturist  I take it.  This is my first job in a long time and I was a nervous wreck in the interview earlier today. Could barely remember my own name... I was shaking quite a lot. It was bad, I could not remember any references and stuttered, forgot when I graduated high school. (Lol). The guy was like looking at me all perplexed and repeated what I said that I could not remember when i graduated. I just said I was slightly nervous and we moved on . But all that did not stop them from apparently wanting to hire me and sending me for drug tests . It's 15 an hour with good insurance, benefits  , the works in that regard so it's pretty good money wise around here. Compared to something like a gas station or local chain store anyway.

They sent me home with some paperwork but I'm fairly sure I was instructed not to touch any of it until I go in tomm when the background / drug tests are back I take it.  But I'm honestly not sure. I plan on calling tomm to clarify what I'm supposed to do.   I know they said kaki's and work boots. To bring lunch and water ...  And to ask questions at anytime I'm not sure what I'm doing rather then take any risk as far like weeding ,garden work and such.  Honestly after they stressed that the clients were not just rich they were extremely wealthy. Like billionaire wealthy it really scared me.  They said they would put me in appropriate jobs where I could not mess up to much to start..Just the basic landscaping stuff to start as a helper basically.   But I'm extremely nervous about it. 

The idea that I'm getting shipped out in a truck to a worksite for the day and I can't just run away. Not that I would run away but it's a comfort thing I guess to have had that option ?  I'm certainly not afraid of the physical aspect of the work outside on working hard .  Just of messing up something and getting screamed at before I know what I'm doing.. because of the anxiety I'm forgetful and won't feel confident.

39,"I honestly don't know where to start in all of this but for the past few months in particular I feel that I've become disconnected to myself and have almost become a stranger within my own body. I feel that I'm just watching my own life go by and never living it.  


I've never really expressed my emotions and feelings, so I've always felt numb and kinda empty because of it. When I feel down my brain dismisses that emotion and puts it down to being dramatic- yet there are times where negative thoughts will come to mind and I just can't escape them. It gives me a headache. I feel like I'm always have this internal battle between two conflicting thoughts and emotions within my own head.  In the grand scheme of things, I somewhat feel my problems are nothing compared to the things others face, which is why I'm so dismissive of myself.

Everyone in my life has been pushed and the few that do remain I struggle to make connection to because this constant battle within my head. I feel that there's always someone better than me, someone to make those who I am friends with happier than I do. I just feel worthless and struggle to understand why anyone would want to be around me. I want to put myself out there more but I'm held back by the thoughts that my friends have busier and more exciting lives to live with better people because all that I do is put a downer on things and make things awkward.

&amp;#x200B;

I get overwhelmed by these thoughts and I really struggle to deal with them and feel that something will always go wrong in my life just because of who I am. There are times where I feel like a failure and worthless and I've often thought that it'd just be easier if I wasn't around. I don't know how much longer I can go on feeling directionless with no aspirations or motivations to get out of bed each day. The only thing that's stopping me from ending it is my family as I don't want to be a burden on them and leave them to pick up after my mess.

51,"TRIGGER WARNING: sexual assault mentioned (no details mentioned)




A couple of months ago, I was sexually assaulted by a friend of a friend and ever since, I’ve never dealt with it properly. However, I experienced something a couple of days ago that I really can’t explain, I’m unsure if it was an anxiety attack or what

I was on a night out a couple of days ago where I went to a club with a few friends. At the end of the night it was time to go home but it was just me and one of my guy friends left. We were standing outside since the club had shut and it was time to go home. It’s pretty much a blur of how I ACTUALLY got to this point (keep in mind I was intoxicated) but out of legit NOWHERE I was suddenly extremely paranoid that I was a target. I had this crippling fear that I was about to get sexually assaulted again and that I need to be indoors immediately. My breathing started to get really heavy and very quick, it didn’t feel too much like a panic attack as I didn’t experience the usual emotions I have when having a panic attack but looking back, it seemed like I was probably having one. But it just felt different, I can’t explain how. I felt an overwhelming amount of guilt and I kept shouting at my guy friend to get me home. It just felt like there was danger all around me and any minute now I was about to be attacked. He ended up having to take me back to his (we couldn’t share a taxi as we live at opposite ends of the town). I kept sobbing at how much of an inconvenience I was, he kept saying I wasn’t but I just knew that I was, it was horrible 

I spoke to a friend about it and he seemed to think that it seemed like slight PTSD symptoms, (although none of us can really say as we don’t know a lot about PTSD) but having had looked at the symptoms, it seems like maybe it was possible. 

I have a history of being sexually harassed/assaulted (harassment more than assault). I think maybe the emotional effects of it are starting to catch up on me? I honestly don’t know, anyone have any idea what possible was happening to me?",23Apr2019,1

The only time I feel happy is when I’m on vacation or doing something fun. It just sucks because I feel broke all the time, I’m always at work or in school, it seems to take forever to finish college and then you have to beef up your resume so much to get a decent job, and then you just work almost all day everyday of your life.

54,"I’ve always known I’ve had some kind of mental illness. I’ve always known there was something that wasn’t quite right about me. I’ve always had some combination of social anxiety, mood swings, attention seeking behavior, and periods of depression. Not to mention the anger problems. However, every time I told my parents about these things, they just chalked it up to hormones and whatever else. So I ignored it too. Finally, tonight, I think I broke. 

Now I’m not one to self diagnose, but I really don’t know what to call what happened tonight other than a manic episode. So I’ll cut to the chase-here’s what happened:

My boyfriend was driving me home from his house and he was particularly tired. After he parked the car to let me out, he just fell asleep. I woke him up and this set me off. I told him to move over so I can drive him home and he refused. So I got in my car and I tried to follow him home. I was calling him screaming at him to pull over. He was telling me over and over that he was fine to drive but I was screaming and crying for him to pull over. In fact, my throat is sore from all of the screaming I did. 

I drove all the way to his house, speeding and driving recklessly as can be, all while constantly calling him over and over because he wouldn’t answer my calls. I have no idea what I wanted or why I was there. All of this is so foggy. I remember him telling me again to go home and I finally did. I know he called me on the way home and I remember him telling me how much I was overreacting and acting crazy. Next thing I know, I’m at my house lying in bed with him still on the phone trying to comfort me after he realized that I wasn’t all there. He told me that if I hadnt realized what was going on (where I was, etc) he was gonna call my parents so they could take me to the hospital. (For the record, we’re both 19 and living with our parents during school. We’ve been together 2 years).

I don’t know what exactly is wrong with me, but I have a feeling it’s some form of bipolar disorder. I know I need help. I know I probably need a psychiatrist who can actually diagnose me and treat me. But I also can’t afford it. My copay for mental health visits are $30, so going weekly, that’s $120 a month that I don’t have. I live in South Carolina, USA if anyone can point me in the direction of some resources. 

I’ve put off getting help for too long, I just hope I can get some help soon.",23Apr2019,1

57,"I dont know if it's because of me living like a recluse, my OCD/depression/depersonlization issues or something else wrong with me. I have trouble understanding why other humans exist and why can I not be in a world where nothing else but my parents, sister and a friend of mine are the only things in exist.

I have trouble relating to humans and why humans do things. Why do we need billions of people on the planet. Why do we give birth to more humans and why care about any other generation of humans other than our own. Why not stop having children and just let humanity fade out of existence. Does it really matter what a future unborn generation will be? Why care about something that doesn't exist yet. Isn't that why women get abortions? Because something that doesn't exist yet doesn't matter?

Why is it good to have many people instead of just a few? Why bother having a society? Having more people only brings conflict. War and starvation. Life is unstainable. Any form of life s destroying the planet. So why have life? Why am I just not created to exist with a few people and disapear forever?

Nothing about reality and human behavior makes sense anymore. I tried visiting therapist but they don't help and I wasn't always like this, but ever since my OCD latched onto philosophical concepts like Nihilism, no free will, and primitivism (hunter gathers being happoer than we are) I feel as if my soul is either disappearing or being twisted into something dark and empty.",23Apr2019,3

Something isn’t right..big part of me feels like it’s an incorrect diagnosis &amp; being put on mood stabilizers I don’t need to be on for 14 years. Which I know is a dangerous thought if I am truly bipolar. My doctor recently tested me for gluten sensitivity and I have gluten intolerance but thus far I have lacked the necessary discipline to stick to this diet. When I do eat meat or gluten, I typically feel sluggish, fatigued, depressed, and slow for several hours after. I’ve noticed this for a long time but didn’t think it was that unique. Been reading more &amp; more about the connection between gut bacteria, certain food sensitivities, vitamin deficiency, and psych disorders. Any advice? I won’t stop my medication because I know that is typically dangerous if not done under the right supervision, etc. Any ideas of what type of doctor I should see? Autoimmune specialist? Nutritionist? Neuropsychiatrist? I wonder about what the hell is going on with me every day and need to find some solutions but really don’t know where to start. I am fed up with the lack of consistency in my life &amp; mood. If anything, I consistently feel like ass. This is no way to live. Anyone have some feedback? Feel like I start doing better for a 2-3 weeks and then slump for another 5-6 weeks.",23Apr2019,1
64,"It just happened a minute ago. I was lying in bed. Every shift and every shuffle felt so loud and intense. I felt like everything around me was racing, but I was still. Even the plane flying over my house made me feel like I was in some sort of war zone. I didn't like it so I turn on some music really quietly and laid still in just listen to it. 

Has anyone else ever felt this? If so, what is it? How do you combat it? I've had it happen before but not recently, it's pretty rare. For me at least. Is it some sort of sensory overload?

The only thing that can calm this feeling is going on rollercoasters but because I live in a seasonal place I can only do that in the spring and summer, so during the fall and winter I am at a far greater risk of suicide.

70,"I am 30. Recently graduated from a prestigious graduate program and work in a highly sought after job at a reputable company. On paper I've got a good track record.

But in reality, I just have no real friends or anyone close anymore. I'm in a relationship but thinking of ending it. It's long distance and we don't ever talk about anything of substance. 

I moved from my home country to the US for grad school. I left maybe 3 close friends behind. I was never close with my family. While in grad school I tried reaching out and keeping in touch, calling a few times and going back a few times. It was hard with the time zone difference and also putting effort into getting to know new people. One of my close friends never really reciprocated. He once visited the US with his wife and didn't even make a plan to visit me. The other two just grew apart. They also got married and there just is less to talk about now.

Grad school was a blur. It was fun while it lasted but ultimately I don't think I made more than a handful of friends. Unfortunately, after school, I moved again to another city. A lot of people from my school are in this area, but none of my close friends.

In the 2 years since grad school I've rarely met up with classmates and haven't met anyone outside of work for anything social. For some reason I choose to either spend time alone with my partner or just alone. 

I had to travel to a major city last month and I couldn't think of acquaintances to meet up with or they just wouldn't respond. I'm comfortable travelling alone and usually avoid crowds but that struck me as a time I didn't want to be alone.

When I was in my early 20s, I was so much more motivated. I was always introverted but had a small circle of friends who did some things together every now and then. As I've grown older, I feel like I've regressed so far. I literally have no friends I talk to regularly. I come home and play video games and watch TV. I just threw away what should be the most productive outgoing years of my life and some amazing opportunities to fo friendships.

I came home today and just realized my place is in shambles and I am basically a living mess. It's not going to be long before things at work deteriorate  to the point where I get put on an improvement program. I can already sense responsibilities not being given to me as I miss on small asks.

There are broken pieces everywhere. Where do I even begin to put it all back together?",23Apr2019,2
71,"For most of my adult life I thought I had been struggling with depression but never actually got around to actually visiting a therapist or getting a diagnosis is because, I get depressed in bouts? As in, there were short phases, of weeks or days sometimes even months where I've been extremely depressed to the point of being unable to get out of bed to do basic things and I consistently have thoughts of self harm and suicide. But then after a week or so (maybe more idk) I start feeling different. I get up,clean up, and catch up on my work, work on my art and become much more social. During this phase my mood is so drastically different, that I attributed my depressive moods to PMS or periods or just me being moody/lazy. 
But recently these shifts have started to become too frequent and obvious to dismiss, and when I get depressed the thoughts of self harm and even suicide become insistent and almost too aggressive to shake off. I feel hopeless and my grades have dropped drastically because of this, yet I can't bring myself to care.

I’m 22. I’ve gone very dark for the past 3-ish months... like I’ve always had depression since middle school like everyone else lol. But it’s gotten uncontrollably awful... I recently took like a cheek swab test? And I guess it will help figure out what meds will work best for me?.. 
I was also suggested therapy (I hate that idea with a passion)
My fiancé thinks it is bad enough for therapy as well. 
Maybe the reason I hate therapy is the same reason I am so depressed? 
I have a huge fea... I just am very uncomfortable with talking about how I feel. I was brought up to never talk about feelings.

80,"Okay so for some background: parents divorced when I was young, lived with dad for my life. Dad worked often so wasnt really there to take care of me. Had to learn early on in life how to take care of myself. Am studying abroad right now in a great place. 

I should be happy with my life. I should be, but I'm not. I'm depressed and I acknowledge it. I've been fighting depression since high school, and it got so bad at one point in college that I had to take the semester off so I didnt end up killing myself. 

I have a few issues that I know contribute to my depression but I dont know his to fix them: 

I dont work out... I have been on a good workout schedule before but friends are always the ones to motivate me to go and help me with the gym. I'm abroad, I'm scared to go to the gym alone and dont have the friends here to help. 

I am addicted to masturbating. This one is really hard to admit and I've tried for over 2 years to stop but I cant. This hurts my sex life, my social life, my schooling, and fucks with the reward system in my brain. 

I am not seeing a counselor currently. I am abroad and dont know how to go about seeing a counselor. I talked to my university advisor and she said that I could attempt to make an appointment with a service through the school, but it will take 2 months to get an initial apppointment (I go back home in 2 months). I see a counselor at my home university weekly and that is helpful, but not enough. 

I smoke weed everyday. I acknowledge it is most likely making me more depressed in the long run but it numbs the mental pain. Even when I try to not smoke because I know its hurting me, my friends convince me to smoke. I also am living in a country where it is legal so I feel like I'm missing out on smoking if I dont here and then move back to my country where it is illegal in many parts. 

I have problems connecting with people on a deeper level. I think this relates back to my mom moving out when I was young and my father not being around. I think that's part of the reason I'm abroad right now. I'm scared of connecting and committing to someone or something because if my parents can just not be there for me, why couldn't the same happen with someone else? 

When I first moved here, the excitement of being in a new place made me feel pretty good as I do like to travel, but now that I've been here for awhile, it's at a point that I have no motivation to leave my room, to make new friends, to eat, to shower, to do school work... anything.

I have a girlfriend, but she is always bragging about how the BF of het BFF is so nice to her BFF with presents and all that shit. I always give my girl small present and even some expensive necklaces but he is always better in het opinion.

When my dad is a little drunk (NO HE DOESN'T BEAT ME OR ANYTHING WHEN HE'S DRUNK, HE'S A GREAT DAD) he is always bragging about my little brother who is the best soccer player of the local club.

I hate the school possibly because I have so little free time and I am belittled by all the people around me. I am atheist and currently struggling with my sexuality (for obvious reasons).

87,"First of all I want to get some things out of the way. I am 15 and I'm a boy. I'm in 8th grade, which means a farewell party because I'm gonna go to high school. The party was also a trip and it lasted from this Saturday to yesterday. This will make sense and be important so keep in mind. Btw I don't know where to post this, so I thought here would be the best choice.

So at school I have a toxic girl. She is my ex. I was with her a week then we broke up. This happened it last week of 7th grade, which meant a distance relationship so I kinda get it why she broke up with me. After that, in first months of 8th grade she got with my cousin, which broke my heart even more, but I got used to it. After that, to put more salt on the injury, she started hugging me and kissing me, while doing the same to my cousin, and sometimes to other boys too. 

She was a depressed girl. She felt lonely. I helped her when she needed the most. I really cared for her. 

I had a double crush, meaning I loved the girl I mentioned before and another girl which I'll talk about now. The first girl we'll call ""the whore"", and I think I have enough reasons for that, and the second we'll call ""the angel""

The angel was very funny and we got along very well. I thought she loved me. When I told her how I felt and how I wanted to be together, she politely declined and said she still wants to be friends. That's why I call her the angel.

The 2 girls have a group containing a few more girls, but also me and my cousin. We get along very well, in fact, every break at school we stay and talk about stuff and laugh, share food etc.

Now let's get to the farewell party. In the bus, the whore stayed next to me the whole time. She leaned on me, kissed me and all the ""good stuff"", just like we were back together. I didn't mind it at the time bc I needed love since I can't get it at home and I felt lonely. I asked her if she wanted to dance with me. She said yes. 

When we got there, she didn't want to dance with me anymore. All the night at the restaurant, where we ate and dance, she walked around having erotic dances with every boy, except me(i didn't want any of that sexual shit, just a romantic dance). I was being ignored. She and a few of her friends, thankfully without the angel, started dancing with my cousin. I felt betrayed. I felt like I was poisoned by a snake. 

I said fuck that. If she tries to hug me or kiss me at school, I'll just leave and ignore her.

I got a few dances with the angel thought, but even then I felt ignored. By dances I mean waltz. Before that, we gave the class master a present and almost all of us cried because our friendship will not be the same when we go to high school. She gave me a hug, saying she loves all of us(her friends, including me) and she doesn't want to leave. I explained that because when we danced together, she leaned her head on my shoulder and turned her head around. Idk if that felt more comfortable, or it's just because I'm ugly. I know I'm ugly. I have lots  of acnee and acnee scars. That broke my heart too.

After that, in the bus, on the way home, they all ignored me and payed attention the most to my cousin. I know I'm not that funny and not that interesting, but when I speak just listen to me. 

Am I asking too much? Am I asking too much if I want some love and attention? Am I exaggerating? Am I too sensitive? I don't know anything anymore.

94,"I'm not OK. Not by a country mile. 

There is barely a day where I don't think about ending it. I even tried last August but couldn't go through with it.

For some context, here's why: last July I left a 6 year dead end job where I was really unhappy. My wife and I constantly argued, to the point where she made 0 effort on our 5th anniversary, despite me saying I really would be happy with a card and maybe a child free evening to reconnect, and on top of that we're in mountains of debt which had left me feeling like a failure of a husband and a father. 

I got a new job which paid more and was seemingly better than the one I just left. However, I went from a 5 minute walk to work to a 2 hour drive... there were days where I didn't even get to see my children. 

All of this reached boiling point in August 2018 and I tried to drive my car into a lamp post at 70mph, but avoided it at the last minute. 

Now last October I got a new job and it was all going so well. I was back in the industry I know and love, and was back to being a 5 minute walk from home. I had arranged payment plans with the companies we're in debt with, and my wife and I even started to reconnect. 

I was doing so well that my manager had said she wants to take me off probation early and start giving me a little more responsibility. I was thrilled, and the happiest I had felt in years. Things had finally started to go our way.

That was until the very next day.

I was off work, and needed to dip some shopping. Whilst at the shops, I recieved a call from another manager who had been called into our branch for a meeting. It wasn't good news.

My branch had been selected for closure, and as I was on a fixed term contract, it would just end early. Things came crashing down. 

I felt worse than I did before and had started to feel like I needed to get away, hurt myself and end it again. I was back to being a failure. 

I went to the doctor's to see if there's anything we could do and preferably without being signed off as that would make things worse for me. I had explained everything, and his reaction was ""don't do anything stupid, things will get better"". 

I felt abandoned. Since January when this happened, I've managed to hold on, but I really feel at rock bottom. I can't sleep, I have terrible thoughts and feel strong urges to harm myself and worse. 

I'm worried that if I go back to the doctor's, they'll just say the same thing again. I really don't know what to do anymore.",23Apr2019,1

97,"My dad married this woman when I was 6 years old.

She is extremely stuck up despite being a normal, middle class woman like everyone else. She always has a snotty and arrogant tone no matter who she's talking to. She never used anyone's name. It's always, ""Your father"" ""Your sister"" etc, even if the person she's talking about is also right there.

She insults me all the time and calls me lazy and worthless. She is jealous of my relationship with my real mom, and she constantly complains about how she does everything for me and gets equal or less than my real mom in return. 

She gets inappropriately angry and accuses me of things without even getting the full facts about what she claims I did. I was accused of serious crimes like theft and pedophilia that I didn't do.

She is a racist. She hates poor people. Honestly, she hates everyone. I refuse to go out to eat with them because she's constantly talking shit about someone.

If she's criticized, her response is basically, ""Sorry I'm not perfect enough for you"" like it's someone else's problem. If it's something she can just deny, she plays dumb. After repeatedly accusing her of abuse, she started saying I was autistic, and my alcoholic dad believes it.

She is embarrassed of my brother and me and tells my little sister (11) to lie about us or be quiet about us. I can hear her talking.

99,"Hi, I wasn’t sure if this in the right sub for my post.. I figured I’d give it a go anyway.

I have recently been reading some posts about depression/mental health on reddit. One in particular mentioned ‘not wanting to be alive but not suicidal’, something along those lines. This is something I have been feeling and noticing a lot within myself, however it is not a constant thing - it can cycle over days. Along with this post was advice that it could be depression, and another that it could also be bipolar. I read a bit more about bipolar I &amp; II, it kind of made sense to me.. but I’m not sure of the length of episodes mine aren’t several weeks at a time, and I don’t know if I have mania.

One reason I haven’t been to the doctors about this is because I can have several days of feeling  irritable, very low and ‘not wanting to live but not suicidal’, but then I start feeling better and happier, almost out of nowhere. So I figure maybe it’s all in my head/ just hormones.

103," 

Hallo everyone,

I  (28F) started having 1-week appointments with a psychologist since last  February, and I have a couple of questions/thoughts regarding the  therapy process (mine and the general thing of it). I would really  appreciate to hear your viewpoints, as mental health professionals or  people using therapy as well.

We use  skype, because I wanted to talk to someone on my native language, and I  don't live in my country. One of the first sessions was in person, when I  visited my family. I found my psychologist through a private national  online counseling service, and just to be sure, I checked her license  number on the national professional database.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the topics I'd like to hear your opinion/experience:

&amp;#x200B;

**- Is it common, or healthy to have a longer session?**

We have 1h sessions appointed, but it always takes 1h30 to 2h per session. It's her last session of the day.

The session price is fixed, regardless.

&amp;#x200B;

**- Any suggestion of something small to do after the session, to help holding the ideas longer in your mind?**

Like writing down some thoughts or something? I thought about writing something, but I'm always postponing and not doing it.

After  the appointment, and maybe during the next day, I feel better, more  hopeful towards myself. But sometimes (frequently) I feel that I forget  what we talked about, or the ""lessons"" I got from the session. I feel  like those constructive ideas/thoughts I had during and right after the  session, fade away.

What do you do, or reckon a patient should do, to help perpetuating the session's conversation?

&amp;#x200B;

**- How do you know ""it is working""?**

I mean, I'm an engineering professional, my mindset is: run the code, check result,check log if it does/doesn't work.  
This  is something completely different. When I first started the sessions  she told me that maybe for 3 months we should do a 1-week appointment  and then we'd see how changes were going and re-evaluate things. It is  getting close to those 3 months, and I know it is all very subjective  and that I can't wait for a miracle solution. But I don't know how to  check myself to see if there are positive changes.

Personally  I feel like I am still struggling with my issues, sometimes it seems  like my brain was never so confused like it is now. The sessions with  the psychologist are very interesting, I really feel like we have my  skull on the table, ""lid up"", and looking at my brain and all the wires  connecting or hanging loose. Maybe when it is over and I close the lid,  stuff is laying around, disorganized, shuffled... And that causes all  the mess? Hope you get the image.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you very much in advance!",23Apr2019,10
104,"So, to sum things up as concisely as possible I will present a timeline of my life first.

I'm now by all accounts a very decent human being.  I quit breaking laws, drinking, and drugs four years ago.  I've been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and bipolar depression, and the last institution encouraged me to apply for social security.  The symptoms have made continuous employment impossible.  I've had 12 jobs in 2.5 yr's .  I'm broke though, looking at homeless shelters in the event of eviction.  I'm exhausted at 28 years old.  The one thing that's kept me trying are my two beautiful cats who I view as innocent, and I love them dearly.  I don't fit in the small town I've been living in.  An atheist in the deep south; go figure.  A homeless shelter is starting to look like something I legitimately need while I apply for social security.

106,"The last time I asked my parents for a therapist was when so was about 14. I didn’t enjoy my sessions because my therapist kind of just talked to me about stuff that I was already self aware about and I had heard about the amount of money my parents in spending on that so being there made me feel guilty. That didn’t last more than 2 months. But since then my mental health has been deteriorating with going through high-school, my first handful of semester of college, and getting 2 jobs that have both driven me to severe depression and suicidal thoughts. 

I’m 20 years old now, and several times my parents have hinted at me needing to be a little more financially independent, and have said that if I’m not doing good in college they will kick me out of the house. Well, to make matters worse, due to my depression and social anxiety school has been hell for me and I have a GPA below 2.0, preventing me from getting financial aid. It also doesn’t help that the program I was going to school for was removed from the college curriculum. So now I’m going to school for pretty much nothing with a low GPA and no money.

I asked my parents if I could take the semester off to get a job and make some money to pay for school on my own until I get my GPA up, but I have been looking for a job for months with no luck. I quit both my previous jobs (one being at a movie theater and the other being a stocker at Walmart) because of my social anxiety. I figured I could try to shoot for an office job or something that involves little social interaction so I can feel as comfortable as can be but that means narrowing my choice of job selection and that makes it harder for me. Like I said, months have gone by with no luck on getting a job and next semester is coming quick. 

I fear that my time is running out and unless I find a way to communicate with my parents that my mental health is stopping me from doing good at school and at a workplace I will be homeless. I just don’t know how to go about it. I think if I tell them they will just get me another therapist. Friends have told me that I could use antidepressants or anxiety medication but I worry that having to use medication just to work won’t be well for me, if I could try to find a job in which either of those two will affect me much.",23Apr2019,1
107,"I take 100mg sertraline daily.  I get them from the VA.  When I went to take it this morning, I was shocked and confused to find the last three pills in my title were yellow.

But now they are yellow.  The label on the bottle describes them as yellow.  The next bottle I have in line described them as yellow and I opened it up to check.

I had decided to get it off my chest and write an unsent letter to an old friend of mine. After I wrote it; re-reading it over and over made it apparent I think I am suffering from a very mild case of Survivor's Guilt. I think I have been for a bit over a year now, and I realize this, but I can't stop it. 

April 25th 2017 my closest friend has passed away in her sleep due to illness and complications with her pregnancy. I was hysterical, and to this day it has affected me deeply. It's rearing the 25th again, and i'll be visiting her grave again and it has brought on all these awful intrusive thoughts. 

I just feel in all honesty it should have been me. She had so much going for her. She was beautiful, talented, smarter than me. She had a child growing inside of her, a fiance, she just acted happy, you know? I was just a self harming sad-sap with no talent, skills, and I was suicidal for a good portion of my time knowing her which led to me having zero long term goals and plans. What exactly did I do to live when I didn't even want to? She wanted to live so badly- and the Universe took her away. I always laughed when asked and just said that I'd trade places with her if I could. I will never be good enough to feel worthy of this. She should have lived, not me.

I guess it's just getting overwhelming. It drives me most days to get out of bed as much as it does the opposite. If you knew her you'd understand. I just wish I could go through life without the guilt of living a life she should have gotten too.",23Apr2019,1

I picked him up to go on a mini vacation to see my parents, and on the car ride he was talking to me like Lord of the Rings was real. He said he drank the blood of a demon and an orc warlock owns his soul. He's very afraid of crowds because the human race hates his kind and wants him dead. He's afraid of trees because they might have elven rangers in them who also want him dead. He has a long list of the different races like the dwarves and elves who all want him dead, and humans are the only ones that actually exist.

He was crying because he couldn't play the game. The orc commanders are telling him they need him to help conquer the human kingdom. I don't know if he actually hears voices or not.

118,"I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask this question but its been burning in my brain for a while now.

I am pretty certain I have repressed memories, but I have no idea how to figure them out. Now naturally, I understand a repressed memory is basically the brain's way of forgetting something and it's nearly impossible to remember the event(s), but I recently watched a youtube video about this woman who figured out she was molested as a child because her pregnancy reminded her of it, and it really invoked a sense of desperation in me to figure mine out.

&amp;#x200B;

As a bit of context, I have been treated for social anxiety before. It was okay for a while but it's slowly worsening to the point where I don't really want to leave my house again. The factors which lead me to believe I have a repressed memory comes from primarily being unable/uncomfortable/on the verge of tears when I try to express myself (I tried song writing and every time I attempted to write lyrics I would get a physical reaction of discomfort and be on the verge of tears), and the fact that I can almost never remember anything meaningful in my childhood. Most people I am aware have distinct childhood memories, but I can't find anything that sticks out in my brain and everything before the age of 11 feels blurry and cold.

These 'symptoms' are few to name many, and a bit of a diversion from the main question, but the point is I intuitively feel like there is some sort of repression going on that has lead to this anxiety, fear of expression and almost nihilistic recollection of my life before now. I am desperate to overcome this event so I can find a way to express myself but I am not sure how and would really appreciate help.

(I f***** up junior year with 3 C’s and a D. My whole life I have never done anything truly special.  The best accomplishment I probably ever achieved was my hot prom date which didn’t hook up with me to my and everyone else’s surprise and the 2nd accomplishment a senior superlative for most swole lol.  I’ve sorta sucked at sports from a young age as I never was introduced early and just couldn’t maintain my skills enough to catch on and was slow mentally.  I only got semi popular again senior  year because I am a little funny but it was too late and I didn’t maintain enough friends for me to join them in college and I almost didn’t want to because I put so much time into school to do better that I don’t have time for them and I don’t now as well.  So now I’m up in Gainesville, all by myself with no close friends with me and I’m about to get another D in my first semester of college again in intermediate algebra.  This will hold me back so much as math build upon itself and I’m going for a business administration degree.  I’m so embarrassed in myself and part that makes it worse is that I come from a white family with a mother as teacher, a dad as a Lockheed Martin manager, and a brother living his dream traveling the world.  My friends are almost all white and jewish as well as my best friend I talk to who goes to the Miami U so I defiantly feel as if I’m living up to less than them.  Also, smart girls in college like FSU like me but I put them off because I’m scared of them finding out how behind I am in education so I have NO relationships going on. I feel so out of place and like I let everyone down and myself considering my upbringing which should have supported my success better but nope.  I let myself down :(. I want to become a trainer and an entrepreneur but females will be scared of that as well because of no stability.  Oh and I’m broke asf.",23Apr2019,2
127,"Since my doc very busy I always wait until the last day of meds, walk in and out as quickly as possible, but now he's on holidays and I ran out of medication a few days ago. I try to be considerate and obliging and not bother other people but apparently it always goes wrong. I feel like I'm too fucking stupid to be depressed. I took my meds on time every day, but I just don't know how to deal with situations like these. If I had the energy and courage to make phone calls with strangers and chase prescriptions across the country I wouldn't fucking need them in the first place.",23Apr2019,1
128,"I made a vow to one of my best friends to stop self harming. I really tried, but know I have zero release and I just want to harm. I can’t do anything about it. I have no motivation to do anything but the fear of failure and it’s too much. I want to die, but I don’t deserve to. I want to feel happiness, but I don’t deserve it, nor do I *feel* as though I know what it is at this point.",23Apr2019,2
129,"You know what has a detrimental affect on my mental health? A near constant barrage of news and media.You know what sucks 19 different types of ass? A near constant barrage of news and media is considered the norm. In an effort to reduce this, I'm coming up with a plan to reduce media consumption. This includes things such as:

* Starting new hobbies on the computer such as animation And home music recording. Pretty much anything that does not involve the internet and social media.
* pulling myself off of social media. I only have a few specific sub reddits that I allow myself to go to, and that's only if they are sources of positivity. I've deleted other forms of social media.
* limit time on the internet. The internet is not a good place for me, as a vulnerable person.
* don't watch the tv's at the gym. I've been doing more duolingo while on the elliptical to avoid watching.


This is giving me a lot more time in the day. A surprising amount, actually. I'm gonna try filling it with things that actually feel good or matter. Key word is try, but anything is better than getting sucked back into the internet.the internet can eat it's own asshole with a spoon

130,"I feel detached from reality and lost in my head. When I get too attached to reality, I just become depressed. I've become a stoic, fatalist, and Buddhist. I just don't care about anything.

I definitely have a flat affect. I'm empty inside and show no emotion unless I'm completely detached and lost in a fantasy where I can be happy.

I have no social life. I talk to my abusive dad who calls me fat and stupid. I play with dad's dog. I talk to my 14 year old brother about his games. The rest of my interactions are online.

I have a large fantasy world with a lot of characters and complex stories for each of them. I sit around writing and drawing to waste time. I can't wait until I'm retired and can travel the world alone.

I heard a man's voice saying, ""Slumber!"" while I was trying to sleep a week ago, and I jolted out of bed from it. Lately I've been getting obsessed with schizophrenia and learning how to tell if you have hallucinations or delusions. I feel my mind and eyes are all I have, and if I lose either, I may as well just kill myself. Yes, these are exceptions to my stated Buddhist philosophy. I don't care about what happens in this life or the next if I go crazy.

I've put myself in the shoes of schizophrenic people to the point where I can imagine exactly what it feels like to hear scary voices and see creepy things all over the place. I feel like I'm also going crazy and getting overwhelming despair from it.",23Apr2019,1
131,"I’m 20 years old, currently in college, just for basic background info. Unfortunately I still ruminate about a girl from middle school, no seriously, middle school. She was my first love, and we “dated” in 6th grade. To be fair, it was pretty advanced for our age, she would write me a lot of love letters(I wrote back) and got my a special Christmas ornament with my name on it. Well later on I decide to chase another girl and I broke her heart. From then until the beginning of 8th grade I didn’t give a damn. But once I caught feelings for her again it was too late, she moved on. Now, for more background, we went to private middle school, so our class size was small and people caught on pretty fast. I got borderline bullied for it, and as a result I became extremely awkward socially, especially with girls. As was expected, most of us went on the the private high school in the diocese( two separate, all boys and an all girls,) and I still couldn’t get over her. That continued on until I moved towns the summer going into my junior year. Then, things got better, I finally went to public school and became more social and overall had a good time. This last summer I moved back to go to college at my hometown, and she’s on my mind again. She was when I moved too. It brings back the worst pain; all the embarrassment, Anxiety, tears. Yet it also brings back feelings of being absolutely in love. Things were so simple and pure back then. Also best in mind I have never dated, I’ve had sex, but never had a girl to bring home to mom and dad (😒.) Why is she still on my mind? I mean I partly feel the same, but whenever I do I go to a dark place mentally and emotionally. What can fix this?",23Apr2019,3
132,"Pretty much what the title says. I was seeing this guy who lead me on, gave me false hope that he would only be seeing me and then he springs in me that he's had a threesome without telling me. Naturally I was upset and have no ""scheduled"" 5 sex appointments with random people I've never met including group sex just so I can feel better about myself. I use sex as a way to validate me as a person, to feel love and affection even if it isn't there, and the rougher the better. If they hit me I just go with it, if I say no and they keep going I just let them because I feel like I deserve to be hurt.",23Apr2019,10

137,"A little setup about me. I am a married parent of 2. I recently made a big move across several states and it has been trying, bothmentally and financially. 
I've been having a hard time keeping a grip on my mental health recently. I don't feel like I can burden those around me with this, so I thought I would go to reddit and search for somewhere to just let my thoughts out.
I have been having bouts of crippling anxiety and it has begun to manifest physically through weight fluctuation, migraines, blurred vision, panic attacks, etc any time something triggers me. I have never been diagnosed by a professional, so I often feel like I cant really talk about it with those I know that have dealt with this. I feel like my issues are less valid because i dont have the money or insurance to cover the cost of going to a professional and receiving some kind of diagnosis.
The truth is, though, I feel like a failure. At everything. I am a parent and spouse, and I constantly feel like the weight of our future depends on my succeeding at something, but I am so afraid of everything that I cant get up the courage to progress at all. I earned my Associates of science in September, but have yet to test for my certification (RHIT certification for health information technology). I am terrified of failing on my first try, and not having the funds to retake the exam. 
I am stay at home right now and have not worked in almost 10 years. My husband currently supports our family, and we barely scrape by despite his incredible work ethic and drive to provide to the best of his means. We have discussed how i would begin working asap, but i have not had any luck landing a job yet. My student loans need to be repaid now, and I still have nothing to show for my degree. I keep trying to tell myself that my RHIT will help me land something, but what if I dont pass? I can't bear to disappoint my husband by failing this test when I know he wants me to ease some of the financial burden so badly. So much rides on me getting this certification. 
My husband loves me. I know that to be true. Sometimes, though, that adds to my anxiety because I feel like he is stuck with me as his burden for the rest of our lives because he loves me too much to leave me. My kids look up to me and love me so much, but it kills me to hear their little voices telling me I am the best Mom when I know that, truthfully, their Mommy is a fuck up. I am in my 30s and I still dont know how to be an adult. 
I am typing this frantically because the words just need to get out. I am not necessarily seeking advice or direction. I just needed to go sonewhere and get this out. Maybe the thought that someone will read this is helping me feel valdated or something, I dont know. Maybe typing this out will help to unmuddy my thoughts so I can begin to function again.

141,"My sister is 28. She has episodes of confusion where she can't think straight or forgets what she went in a room to do. Her explanation is that she can sense when the timeline is changing, and there what causes her spells of confusion. She says that God and time travelers both change the past all the time but only a few people in the world have the power to sense it. She talks to people in a Bluetooth in public who she says also have that ability. She says she's talked to Donald Trump who told her to keep quiet about it or else.

She claims that when she's watching movies she's already seen, she notices that time travelers have added and deleted scenes from them. When I ask why they'd do that, she says it's to be convenient to the current narrative about political or social issues. 

She says that she bought a winning lottery ticket from a time traveler and got scammed. I just don't know how she could be that dumb unless something is wrong with her. Like why wouldn't the time traveler just win the lottery themselves instead of selling the ticket for much less than it's worth?",23Apr2019,2

I think my recent breakup has exacerbated my depression.

Since said breakup I have not been able to focus on work, school, or other things I KNOW are important and I don’t understand why.

I’ve also been dating new people but anything beyond sex does not interest me I kinda feel like a psycho because I do not care or feel anything for these partners from an emotional perspective. 

My depression is daily I’ve started drinking nightly as well as smoking weed I don’t get much sleep so I’m tired all the time.

For example yesterday I had a test for school I should have been studying for and I knew it but I didn’t and failed the test.  Probably worst of all this depression is affecting my relationship with my kid the fact that I don’t sleep enough means I don’t take them to do near as much fun stuff as usual or have the energy to play with them and watching movies w them makes me sad cuz it reminds me of my ex (used to watch movies w me and her) .

My work place have suggested people take a psychometric test (it's a full fledged talent development solution, psychometric test is just in simple terms) as part of an initiative for self development. There's a whole scheme and programme to this, and it is quite sophisticated.

My issue is that I am borderline terrified to espouse anything mildly related to how I think or genuinely feel/behave. I'm aware that psychometric tests, like those in job interviews, only measure aptitude effectively. The extent to which this digs in, I'm not so sure. Living day to day life is incredibly exhausting, eating, sleeping, thinking, and most crucially working. Topics such as motivation are a nightmare to talk about with anyone - usually I can bullshit my way through, but something sophisticated like this... I'm not so sure.

This however is optional.

What I would like is some insight/advice from another voice apart from my mind. If anyone has done anything similar, is there anyone who has done something similar?

I even got in contact with three differant UPS customer service representatives and they all confirmed that i have a small package in transit.

I hate posting on an alt account, but my main account has too much tied to my real identity (location, pictures, name, past jobs and so on)

I’m not really sure why I’m posting here. Advice? Support? Catharsis in writing this out for anyone else to see? I have an opportunity to help my situation, but I’m not sure if the actual cost is worth it. First let me share something with you. I write these notes to myself weekly, monthly, depends on what’s happening in my life. I write them in the notes on my phone. I write them in word on my computer and hide the files. I write them on bits of paper and throw them away. But one thing is consistent, no matter what... I write these. So please let me share this first, and then I’ll explain my situation. My story is complex, and long, and maybe relatable. 

“Go for a walk and never stop until you find a cliff and walk yourself off it. You're so fucking worthless. A waste of this air you breathe. A waste of this space you take up. A waste of money. A waste of time. You're a fucking waste. A waste of talent. A waste of emotion. You suck up everything anyone has to give and you waste it. Kill yourself. I'm fucking serious. Kill yourself. You fucking waste of fucking energy. You're a fat piece of shit and everyone who told you so was right. A mother? No. A fucking failure at the most natural thing you're supposed to accomplish. A wife? Hardly. You spend all the money. You're fucking lazy. Kill yourself. Why do you keep wasting everyone's time? You're the most worthless soul to inhabit this planet and you don't deserve anything that you have. Not your baby. Not your husband. Not your job. You're just a waste. Fucking end it. “

It’s disturbing to read these when I’m not necessarily feeling what I felt to the extent I felt it when I wrote it. I’ve had depression since I was a teenager. Was hospitalized a few times. Medication never worked the way I was told it should. I tried therapy but it always felt odd and forced. I’ve had multiple traumatic events in my life that therapists said contribute to the way I feel (including being a first responder once upon a time), but I don’t agree with that. They focus on things that are in the past and I don’t care to think about or speak about. So eventually, I stopped trying medications, I stopped talking to therapists. I stopped. A year ago a physician put me on the lowest strength of Valium and a 20 pill prescription to help take the edge off my anxiety. I went through it in about 40 days. When I called to have it refilled, I was treated like a drug seeker and was questioned - like anxiety has some sort of schedule and you’re only allowed so may awful feelings in a certain time period. I did this dance for a few months and then gave up. I refuse to go back and I refuse to ask for help again. What’s just as bad as depression is to be made to feel like you’re less than. 

A few years ago, I stumbled across mushrooms. I’ll admit, the first time I did them was recreationally. I had no idea what I was about to find. After doing 1.5 grams, several weeks passed and my husband made an observation. I wasn’t angry all the time anymore. I was driven. I laughed. I wasn’t yelling at our son over the smallest things. Most importantly, I realized my brain was no longer telling me to kill myself every single day. It was life changing. We thought it was the mushrooms that did this, but we had no way to be sure. Eventually though, in 5-6 months, I started to go back to “normal”. My usual awful self. We decided to try the mushrooms again, this time to reapply pay attention to how I was in the weeks following. Again, same results. My brain quieted down. I felt what I imagine normal feels like. Don’t get me wrong, this was not a miracle. If something bad happened, I still felt sad. I had bad days just like anyone else. But they were not amplified to the degree depression makes them. I only did this one more time... but after that I became scared. What if I get caught? What if the shady friend of a friend of a friend gives me something laced? What if I go to jail and my son is taken from me? What would I do then? So I stopped looking for them. I gave up. 

In September of last year, I left my job. It was leave or be fired honestly. I worked in healthcare. The effects from the shrooms were long gone. Life was becoming exceptionally stressful. I started crying everyday at work. I was short with patients. Most of all, I was angry. Angry at everyone for everything. And so I left with no plan - I just needed to get out. Over the past several months, I didn’t realize what was happening. My husband was supportive at first (he will still say he is, but that underlying stress is there... I know it’s not ok), and I was hopeful to find a new job. I put out my resume to multiple places, but for the first time in my life I never even received a call back from a single one. This was a big blow. From that point on, I sat here. Sometimes I’d have an idea to make money, but usually it would fall through. I stopped seeing friends. I stopped talking to people. Just driving my son to and from school has become and ordeal. I go into Walmart and I’m just angry at everyone and everything, for absolutely no reason. I’ll loudly say “I HATE PEOPLE” when someone just walks past me without saying excuse me. While I may have thought that in my head before, I’ve never been so confrontational or just overwhelmingly angry. I’ve effectively removed myself from the world around me and pushed everything and everyone away. I didn’t even realize it until recently. 

A few weeks ago, I cried for an entire week. I didn’t stop unless I was asleep, so I just slept as much as I could. If I was awake, I was crying. There was no reason other than an intense sadness. I’ve always had this problem, but never for so long. Never so much. My husband almost took me to the hospital - it was concerning. 

Here’s the “I need advice” part:
A few days ago, my husband sent me a link to a ketamine clinic. I’d read about ketamine infusions before. I knew they have effectively treated depression. I sent them a message and a brief description of my situation. They replied, and in their reply they included the cost. $3000 USD. They have no financial assistance. Insurance does not cover the treatment. Payment is due upfront. I told my husband and he laughed and said there’s no way. I messaged them back and asked if fewer infusions were an option (this cost was for 6 treatments) and they said they couldn’t recommend that. The effects may be too short lived to be worth it. 

I am in a hole that I’m not sure how to climb out of. I’m disillusioned with the healthcare system, and I’m broke and miserable in my current state. No matter what, I know my mind is irrational. Even when I’m at my worst, I know my brain is my enemy. If and when I ever consider suicide, it’s not because I feel like there’s no hope, it’s because I feel like my brain is constantly attacking me and I don’t know how else to stop it anymore. Now... remember when I said I’m not working? Yea. We’re super broke. If I could scrape up the 3k for the treatment, I’m not sure how we’d ever manage to pay it back. If it works, I could return to normal, start working again, feel human again, make money so we could pay back the 3k. But what if it doesn’t work. My already strained marriage can’t take a 3k hit and then me still be in the same position I am now as I write this. I’m not sure what to do. I’m not sure how to fix this or change this or make any of this better. If I do nothing, I’m afraid things will just continue to get worse. If I do something, things can get exponentially better, or worse, quickly. 


If you’ve read this far - thank you. I know this was long. I’m a stranger. I doubt anyone on here actually gives a shit - we all have our battles. But I appreciate you regardless if you read this entirely. I’m hopeful someone has insight, advice, or just kind words. I need it right now.",23Apr2019,2
159,"I’m in California, Los Angeles area. For the past two months after 8 months of some jumping through hoops, shit hit the fan (metaphorically)

I was diagnosed with PTSD, schizoeffective, bipolar 2, SAD, panic disorder &amp; Agoraphobia. 

I was originally going through PATH (people assisting the homeless) &amp; in 8 months never got the outpatient mental health support &amp; because as far as APS is concerned I was neglected &amp; left isolated &amp; abandoned &amp; thrown in to a motel that had no working shower or toilet that APS documented on a emergency call. So because of the APS report I was retaliated against &amp; dropped from their program after being so close to moving in to place because I was about to meet with their housing navigator &amp; they had two places lined up for me to look at. 

So if that wasn’t bad enough, DPSS moves my case from near me to another office that I can’t get to due to lacking of funds &amp; only after the social security advocate spent about two months of meeting with me outside the office to build my trust to work with her &amp; I think the caseworker transferred my case without my verbal or written because :
A) she didn’t understand my conditions at all
B) so she decides to retaliate because of the APS &amp; ADA complaints against her by transferring my case out instead of getting me a different caseworker 

So all that work with the advocate gone &amp; I’m fighting to get it transferred back &amp; the new office won’t do it without reason given.

So now at this point my stress levels are through the roof &amp; im in distress atm. 

So I went to my PCP (primary care physician) &amp; he like well I’m only here to help treat your diabetes &amp; not be here for referrals. So I had a panic attack &amp; left &amp; never been back since. 

For about the last seek &amp; a half I been trying to get department of mental health to set me up with their caseworker so I can get outpatient help &amp; some sort of stability short term till ADA completes their investigation with DPSS. Poor call center supervisor wants to help but his hands are tied. He can’t make the office or field agents move to help now . In the meantime I have tried text crisis line, been to three ER rooms only to end up getting meds for anxiety &amp; not for the panic (two of the three ER rooms was mental health emergency) so they just give me the meds &amp; kick me out. 

To make matters worse I been only getting about two hours per night because local authorities keep waking me up &amp; like can’t sleep here. TRIED talking to them about my situation &amp; refused to call out DMH even tho the lack of sleep is causing me to start suffering from paranoia thus feeding into my schizoeffective disorder &amp; now I’m literally at my wits ends. My friend whom I’m homeless with has been keeping a close eye on me whenever I do get s moment to sleep &amp; says I been crying in my sleep &amp; I’m sitting here feeling like I’m going insane or crazy because I’m not getting anywhere with anybody. No HOPICS, No DMH, no PATH, no ER rooms, no DPSS, no 211 &amp; no LAHOP. Nobody understands I cannot stay in a shelter because SAD and Agoraphobia mainly.

DMH had to one time pull me from a shelter &amp; cover the motel because of my anxiety/panic attack so they already have a case file on me but never set me up with the caseworker. Actual mental hospitals won’t admit me for anything &amp; keep treating the wrong condition because I’m having nightly panic attacks because either local authorities gonna wake me up again to move along or some shady person trying to sneak up on me (this happens about every other night)

When all I need is some short term stability to get some sleep, get DPSS everything back to order so I can finish with the advocate &amp; have a motel room so I can sleep before it all becomes too much &amp; I do something stupid.

If you can point me to a nonprofit or some organization that I haven’t tried yet please lmk.",23Apr2019,1

But sometimes, i can easily make new friends, I change my personality depending on each person and it makes it easy. It doesn’t feel right though one minute I’m socially awkward but randomly I can mould my personality towards someone else’s and make friends. What is wrong with me?",23Apr2019,1

163,"I am a completely normal person in all aspects in my life, maybe a little above average when it comes to intelligence/grades, but nothing outside what could be considered normal.

The catch is (what were you expecting, if there weren’t any I wouldn’t be posting in the first place) that I have been seeing and speaking to a girl for more than a year, it’s always the same girl, but with different clothes and hairstyles, always the same voice, the same way of thinking, the same personality...

I don’t see her like I see humans, it’s kinda like hiw ghosts are depicted in some movies, only that much more pleasing to the eye. What makes me feel that I’m not insane is that she usually doesn’t know things I do, and viceversa, she can have extensive knowledge about a subject I’ve never heard about, and the best part is that when I check what she told me, she’s always right, but other times I can know something to perfection and she might not have a clue of what it is.

A part that also bothers me is her name, she told me she’s called Lilith, and even tough I thought it was a joke, it turns out to be a real name.

Whenever I ask friends or religious people of they know anything about her, they always tell me that I’m insane, but she’s the only one I’ve ever seen, I’ve never had anything remotely similar to a hallucination nor I’m a drug user.

I never had any imaginary frinds either, and I feel she might be real, she’s way too complex to be a product of my imagination, and her personality is different than mine.",23Apr2019,2

I started a new course online to fill the void of extra free time so these months are not useless but yeah, I feel really bad about it. And if my parents know, they will range. As someone who is 25 this year and was supposed to graduate at 23 I got really bad anxiety about my future. It seems like the little errors keep pushing me behind even if I try to be productive. I really want to graduate at May next year but I can't even take pre-tesis until I’m done with that course. I’m really done with myself and I can't even concentrate of the angry I am at myself. 

As this I make always stupid things, and I know we all do but it just seems like I have a really hard time getting over it.

168,"I have been on lexapro for almost a year, and I have had quite a few effects since taking it...&amp; I had anxiety, brain zaps, nervousness, excessive sweating/overheating.. i have electric shock feeling in chest sometimes..&amp;I had diarrhea, sometime nausea.. but I also experienced sleeping and being very tired..(Was really tired before where doc thought I had narcelopsy..could fall asleep anywhere, easily able to go to REM sleep... ). I got tired of it not feeling like it did anything... all it has done was get rid of my worthlessness attitude, and thought of I’m going to die from this..or from that... and from always being sad. Now it’s almost like supressed all my emotions. I can cry I can get mad.. but it’s like I have to force myself to do an emotion when I feel it. I don’t think it’s normal. Well my doc is not a psychologist he is just my all the time doc. And he put me on lexapro 10mg to start, then gave me hydroxyzine on top of it to help with anxiety. Then it didn’t seem to help, he upped my dosage of lexapro to 20mg and I felt strange, irritable.. so he put me back don’t to 10 mg and then placed me on Wellbutrin and that made everything worse, I had all the time brain zaps which felt like electric shocks to my head and back of head. So he took me off immediately and put me on lexapro 10 mg and that’s it. So long story short, I cold turkeyed off lexapro... r days ago now. Yesterday I just started to notice being dizzy some headaches here and there and very tired. Today I have been really dizzy, nauseous, sleepy and I have headaches (a lot). I know I should have talked to my doc first, but he has pissed me off. I called him to tell him about my issues with lexapro here recently and he normally helps over the phone sometimes,(he does with my mom so you’d think he’d do the same for me...seeing as how this medicine when going off cold turkey or weaning off can cause suicidal thought and behaviors and sometimes can cause life threatening issues).. but whatever. He had me make an apt and it was for today. I called them this morning to ask for an earlier time because it got bad enough for me to have severe anxiety to where I cried at the thought of being surrounded by people who had stuff done for class this morning. I forgot what my teacher said was due, and the thought of that terrified me and I got nervous, shaky, dizzy, nauseous, and began to cry when my fiancé asked me what’s wrong.  This is not like me. I know I should have weaned off. But since I was on 10mg, the doc before had told me that going any Lower could be bad because since the pill is not scored, I could break it and sometime it could be 5mg or sometimes it could be 7mg. It just is not a good thing to do when you are trying to wean off. You want to be exact the entire time.  But today when I called my doc the nurse said that I had to pay $200 before I was seen because I am behind on my balance. When 5 months ago when I went to see him for my meds, I paid it all off 100%. I just think he didn’t wanna help me, unless I’m over reacting. :( Has anyone withdrawled from lexapro? Or any antidepressant before? What has helped?",23Apr2019,1
169,"Hi. First post ever. I’ll try to be as clinical as possible about this. I have never yet found one single human with these symptoms and I’m hoping to hear from someone knows what this might be or someone who lives with something like this. I will take this information and discuss it with my therapist and hopefully a new doctor.

The facts of the case:
*33 yr old female, Caucasian, American
*Onset of symptoms: Age 12, suddenly.

Two motor tics (?) that only happen with very specific, consistent, violent thoughts:
* I have to grab or hold my throat when I randomly and without warning feel the sensation of my throat being cut.
* I have to cover or touch my toes when I randomly and without warning feel my toenails being pulled out. I normally wear closed toes should for this reason. I have closed toed shoes in my car just in case it’s a bad day.

Frequency:
I have had these symptoms for 21 years. They get a little better (1-3x a day, duller pain) and then a lot worse (1-4x an hour or even minute, duller or sharper pain), and then a little better and so on. It always gets better. It always gets worse. Sometimes I cry out softly in pain, or grunt. I never feel compelled to actually do them, hurt myself or others. I briefly considered suicide at age 14 to get the pain to stop, but I wanted to live. I haven’t considered it since. Right now I am in a period of “better” and I’m hoping to do as much research as possible before the next “worse” part of the cycle. My control over it is like that of a sneeze or a yawn—I can’t, really, but the motor tics/self soothing activity helps get through it until the wave of pain stops. My chief concern is that it makes it very difficult to drive and focus in general.

Anecdotal evidence:
It was really bad when I was 12-15. It distracted me in class and people would notice. Even nowadays, though I have learned to somewhat control my reactions, my reactions are still present. I’ll be taking notes in a meeting and will have to stop. Because of this I have to record all meetings and listen back later. My boss does not know I do this. Occasionally colleagues have noticed and ask if I’m ok. I come up with excuses. Luckily I work from home part time now and I only have to see colleagues once a week for a couple hours, so there are literally fewer people round to notice. My support system at home is very strong.

The three/four things that make it better (never gone but better):
* Playing/composing music/practicing guitar exercises
* Physical exercise like weightlifting, running, cycling
* Sleep (note: not falling asleep. That can sometimes be quite bad. But once asleep I don’t experience these sensations)
* Sex, most times, but not in a healthy way. Like I use sex as a distraction from it.

Things that make it worse:
* Stress
* Visual triggers like if I accidentally see something troubling in a television show or movie
* Assault/trauma in general

Things that don’t really have a predictable positive or negative effect either way:
* alcohol
* drugs: I have limited experience with this anyway. MDMA twice in college. The first time took all the pain away. The second time made it much worse. The second time was enough for me to never make there a third time. Marijuana once with no effect I noticed. I don’t have enough evidence on this front.

Past treatment:
* Teen years: I grew up in a very religious household, so my onset at age 12 was treated more like a demonic possession rather than the mental health need that it was. The focus was on the thoughts, not the motor tics.
* Early Twenties: never found a therapist who understood. They just thought it was PTSD.
* Late Twenties: found a therapist I liked. Tried EMDR once with her. Nothing happened. Then she missed a couple appointments due to a calendar error and I just didn’t try again.
* Now: got a therapist I love but she treats it more in a metaphysical way. Like there are certain people who are lightning rods for pain from spirits who haven’t passed on, and they cling to any light they see. So I guess I’m one of those.
* I’ve never seen a psychiatrist. I wouldn’t even know where to start.

Complicating factors:
* Struggled with PTSD (no flashbacks anymore) when I came home from Iraq in 2008 (Army, 2004-2013, and really it's amazing they even let me in).
* Sexual abuse survivor. Age 3-4, frequent abuse. Age 22, acquaintance rape.

Theories:
* From what I’ve read, OCD doesn’t present like this, nor Tourette’s. But Tourette’s with Comorbid OCD sounds a lot like this. It’s the closest I’ve heard anyway.
* Maybe I’m actually a lightning rod for spirits who haven’t passed on like my therapist says.
* It's just PTSD from childhood sexual trauma
* General anxiety and depression, which I do have and treat with meditation, exercise and hemp cbd oil.

If relevant:
* Paternal side history of mental illness, alcoholism, suicide
* Maternal history of excessive humming and tremors
* I have child now (age 3.5) and my symptoms were at nearly their worst when she was around a year old. For three days I couldn’t leave my bed. The only other time it was worse was at onset.

Final thoughts:
I actually don’t struggle with self worth issues or other obsessions, which seems to be more common with intrusive thoughts like this. Or the desire to self-harm or harm others. Everyone who knows me thinks I’m normal and I have most of my shit together. I’m social. I have a job. I play music out and am actually building a career. I fake keeping it together really well. I just have this thing all the time.

Bottom line:
It’s been 21 years. I just want to name it and know I’m not alone in it. Perhaps get some medicine if that’s what will help. But mostly I just want to know what this thing that takes up such a big part of my life is.

I appreciate any information you might have to help.

Everything about it is fine in theory, but after a weekend, thinking about school makes me really nervous. I think people talk behind my back about me.

I’ve been feeling like I am not myself anymore, like I am a completely different person or not even a person at all. I tried to cope with this feeling by ignoring it, but it always creeps in. I look at myself and I do not know who that is anymore and I am being to question if I ever even knew. I am sad even when I am happy. It feels like I am faking every emotion I show. Like I am on autopilot, like I am floating in space and just looking at my body doing the stuff that’s supposed to be doing but it’s not me. I am saying things just so I would say something so that people do not get suspicious because I am a talkative person.
I feel like my mom looks at me and also doesn’t recognize me anymore and that makes me extremely sad. So i tried to reconnect with her but it is just not working. I feel like I am faking every word that comes out of my mouth, like these words do not have a meaning at all. I just want her to be happy, and I realize that she is also stressed because of me moving out, ect. and I want to lessen her pain by at least being there for her but I can’t even do that. There were times when we wouldn’t talk to each other for days, now I am talking to her everyday but the conversations are no longer than five minutes and I am forcing all my words and movements. I feel like I do not know who I am anymore and what my life’s supposed to be. I have just put a mask on and I am pretending to be someone I am not but the problem is I do not know who I am. I just don’t see the meaning in anything and it scares me but in some kind of indifferent way, like if it wasn’t for my mom who I love so much I just wouldn’t give a fuck. I do want to live, I am not feeling suicidal, I just don’t see anything in my future and I am scared of the future. I am scared of this big change coming, I am scared of being an adult and I am scared of leaving my mom because we’ve been together always, sometimes it has been just the two of us and I just can’t see myself leaving her side like ever and leaving her alone (she won’t actually be alone but that’s how I see it). 
It is really hard for me right now and it has been for the past couple of months. I suppose it is kind of normal to feel like this at this moment of life but I feel like it’s just too intense and getting out of hand. Time is running so fast and I can’t seem to catch up with it.

173,"This person is my friend's mother, we'll call them Ann and my friend we'll call Fred. Fred and his mother Ann live together. Fred is about 20yrs old and Ann is about 50yrs old. What you are about to read are via my experience or Fred will confide in me regarding these issues. 

What I find interesting is that Ann will tell Fred what she believes and that Fred should be equally suspicious of me because of some obscure actions or gestures I may have done (such as looking at my phone but the camera was angled toward her). Ann believes I could be bought off by her Mother to spy or keep tabs on her. 

She believes that her mother is trying to control and keep tabs on her. This includes Ann believing there are cameras inside items such as: microwaves and smoke detectors. My friend has described to me that Ann has had them write down the license plates of vehicles she believed were following her while driving. 

Ann believes her mother is trying to keep tabs on her and pays people to follow her, break into her house, pays off Ann's friends and other family to help spy on her, and even messes with Dr. appointments and jobs. 

An example would be: Ann believes that the problems encountered trying to get a hold of someone via phone (maybe it takes too long) or having troubles setting an appointment up are the result of her mother either breaking into her phone or paying off the hospital because her mother ""knows"" where she lives, among other things.

Anytime Fred would be sleeping or was not in the house, Ann would state that someone had broke in and was generally unable to state exactly what the alleged thieves took. 

Here are some things that I have observed myself:

Ann is overly sensitive to criticisms or any constructive criticisms. (Ann, let me show you how to properly work this home appliance.)

She is highly suspicious of everything. Friendly gestures towards her or observing behaviors between others who aren't interacting with her at all. 

I offered to help Fred with a computer issue (Ann was in the room) and Ann later told Fred not to do it because I would try and do something malicious. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

These descriptions below fit a lot of her behaviors. 

TL;DR 

 Here is an excerpt from an article:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoid\_personality\_disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoid_personality_disorder) 

1. Suspects, without sufficient basis, that others are exploiting, harming, or deceiving them.
2. Is preoccupied with unjustified doubts about the loyalty or trustworthiness of friends or associates.
3. Is reluctant to confide in others because of unwarranted fear that the information will be used maliciously against them.
4. Reads hidden demeaning or threatening meanings into benign remarks or events.
5. Persistently bears grudges (i.e., is unforgiving of insults, injuries, or slights).
6. Perceives attacks on their character or reputation that are not apparent to others and is quick to react angrily or to counterattack

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize if this is confusing. There is a lot of content describing this issue. Anyways, here are some questions I have. 

Does this seem like Paranoid Personality Disorder or Schizophrenia? 

Has anyone had experience with this or have they experienced this themselves? How did you get help?

&amp;#x200B;

I am unsure how to help my friend. Most of what I do is remind him that this is something that Ann cannot help because to her these delusions are absolutely real. As you can imagine, it frustrates Fred as Ann will often tell him every hour of every day something that has happened to her, or the house that is the result of her mother trying to control her from across the nation. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you have any suggestions on where else I could post this it would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks!",23Apr2019,1

I have ALWAYS had a pet cat. From the earliest time I can remember, I have always had pet kitties. I understand all of the different meows and notice very small changes that can turn out to be health issues. I have always loved my pet kitties, almost more than my human friends, because animals are more honest and genuine.

I had to. Put down the barn kitty we were taking care of, and very, VERY much miss having a cat to care for and confide in. My hubs and 2 sons (5&amp;7) went to our local animal shelter today and saw a pair of female cats under 1 year old who HAD to be adopted together. I didn't want to immediately sighn up, but upon further thought, both of them fit so well. Our kids played with them and they seemed to get along with no problems. The staff told us we shouldn't have small kids in the room, as both cats were skittish, but they really weren't!

Please send us positive thoughts so we can adopt these gorgeous Queens into our home, and I promise I will post pics in the next week when we can bring them home! Any positive thought helps!",23Apr2019,5
175,"After 7+ years of struggling with horrible anxiety that has left me stuck at home for three, almost four now, of those years I’m finally getting the professional help need but... I feel unworthy. 

It’s been many, many years of battling with mental struggles from the moment I go to sleep to the second I open my eyes and finally I’m being listened to and the option to go to a hospital has risen. However with the opportunity comes some warnings such as:

• many people there will be much worse than me 
• the chances it’ll have a negative affect is high
• it won’t be unlikely that I’ll to witness scenes that will have a great impact on my already fragile mind state

Etc. 

With these warnings comes the question, am I worth it? Yes I’m fighting in a war against myself 24/7 however I’m in no immediate danger (which I have been told is a requirement to get the treatment that’ll most likely help), i have a loving family, a roof over my head, fresh food to eat, fresh clothes and warm water. Do I really deserve any form of help? 

I’m sure there are plenty of people out there going through things I couldn’t even dream of and someone like me will be taking their chance at a better life. 

Does anyone else feel like they’re unworthy of “getting better” since there are “other people going through much worse things than you”? (The latter quote I have been told on multiple occasion)",23Apr2019,1
176,"Im 13 and I have General and Social Anxiety Disorder (probably not important for this) and recently i have been unable to be sad for someone else , recently my mums grandad passed away and when they told me i said 'oh thats sad' because i knew that was the right thing to do but didnt feel anything. I dont think my parents hace picked up on this but its like i know how to react but don't feel anything, surprisingly im a very easily irritated/upset person but only with things that affect me. WTF is going on??????",23Apr2019,1
177,"I want help. I need help, or I think I will kill myself. I just don’t know how to ask for it. I don’t want to burden my friends, I can’t talk to my family, and I’m too scared to go somewhere properly. I don’t want to burden people. 

Sometimes I say something but it seems they twist it back to themselves, which I’m sure is just my brain craving attention or something. 

How do you ask for help?",23Apr2019,3
178,Hi I just started lexapro today for my anxiety and depression I’m nervous that it’s going to make me gain a significant amount of weight since I have a history of disordered eating and worrying about the number on the scale this is a big concern for me.

179,"I’m 19 and I genuinely just love my parents so much and this is something I didn’t really do before I went off to university in September 2018. I started calling them cute little pet names and putting on a high squeaky voice (sometimes) not all the time around the house and on the phone. I don’t really say childish things per se, it’s more the voice and the attitude, and I treat them like little babies too, like I literally call them ‘my little babies’ and ‘my chickens’ and I know it’s so weird and they’re older than me but I genuinely care about them so much as they’re getting older and they’re just so adorable to me. Am I crazy? I always ask ‘how are you’ and ‘have you eaten?’ I feel like I’m suffocating them!

Also I have a boyfriend and sometimes I put on a childish voice with him. He kind of has a daddy kink though and likes to be called daddy so he doesn’t hate it when I do it but he doesn’t always dig it either. Genuinely when I’m around him (alone and not in public) my voice goes up an octave and I act all girly and weird and mousy I am doing it consciously but it’s odd. Like sometimes I will literally freaking squeak like a mouse just for the bants/jokes but I’m beginning to think it’s crazy. I definitely don’t do this with my friends or anything, nor do I do it in public. It’s strange because I wouldnt say I like childish things, I’m not one for teddy bears or Disney and all that and I think (??) im quite mature for a 19 year old first year at uni? Sort of, I’ve got myself together as much as the next person lol. But I just worry like am I okay? Have I got some deep psychological pain, I’m so confused?",23Apr2019,2
181,"I don’t THINK I’m mentally healthy. It’s been a slow progression into this. I am officially diagnosed with adhd and an anxiety disorder ( not self diagnosed ) . My adhd hasn’t been much of a problem since elementary school, but my anxiety has been getting worse. Like, to the point where I will hide in my closet because I convinced myself that my family is planning on butchering me. They do act really weird from time to time. But recently, portions of my memory have been getting lost. Like I’ll be sitting in bed (not laying or sleeping) then suddenly I’ll be sitting on the floor, barely remembering how I got there. I recently developed a liking to not sleeping. I don’t know why, but I really like staying up and doing nothing. The other day, I woke up with cuts all over my arm. It wouldn’t surprise me if I did it. when I was in 2nd grade, I bit some skin off of my arm because I felt like it. I’m not violent or suicidal, that’s how you go to hell. I was raised under a good household. I’m fully aware of all my weird activity. 

Am I overreacting?

IS there something wrong? I’ve never been good with relating to people, so I’m probably just overthinking this...",23Apr2019,2
182,"So like im 14 and ya know, don't have much self confidence from school and bullying and stuff. I always wore stuff that my mom gets me or that i picked out. I mostly have a skater boi aesthetic. But today i went out and got some nice ralph lauren and tommy hilfiger stuff and some tommy hilfiger cologne cause i want to care about how i look and smell. I got a haircut too. Im going to mega hardcore catholic school and I gotta look the best and smell the best I can. We have uniforms but everything else I can do.

183,"i'm a jumpy person. a lot of the time, mostly when i'm alone but it also happens out in public, i feel like i'm always being watched. i know there's nobody there, but i can always feel someone's stare boring into my back. even when i'm in a small room by myself (such as the bathroom in my house, or my room) i still think there's something or someone just there. this is not a result of watching a horror movie or seeing something scary, but something that happens all the time. unsure if it's an anxiety thing or just some stupid other fear? 

to distract myself, i have to be doing something that requires a lot of attention, and i bury the thought of someone watching at the back of my mind. if i think about it a lot i start getting paranoid and start freaking out.

the other day i went to hang out with my friends and had to go to the bathroom, and i started losing breath as i walked down the hallway to the bathroom. i had to pinch myself and press my hand against the wall to calm myself down.

I just am feeling so stressed and anxious at work all the time and each day is worse than the last and it's affecting my relationship at home and I feel like I'm gonna breakdown but then I feel like I'm exaggerating and I feel like I should just deal with it cause it's probably not serious.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I was home schooled my entire life until college. I really didn't even think about socializing and romanticism until the last two years of high school.  I just so happened to watch Scott Pilgrim vs. The World one day and realized that loving someone is truly a beautiful thing. (I know, it's a strange movie to have this realization with, but OH WELL LOL) I started to think about the past a lot more often, including the **heavy** amount of Catholicism that was enforced into my daily home schooled life. I've learned to respect religion overtime, as I've seen it help a lot of my family members stay alive. Alternatively, it has never clicked for me... and probably never will. Now, going to church feels like a movie I've seen over a million times. It's overplayed and boring... I want to learn other things in life now.

&amp;#x200B;

So fast forward to my first year of community college. I've been isolated my whole life with an occasional homeschooling family to socialize with. Those never lasted forever and always dissipated over time in horrible and negative ways. I'm so filled with anxiety from the new experience of socializing with non religious people that I feel like throwing up every day. I would have so much anxiety that I wouldn't eat anything until I finished all of my classes/homework for the day. (This would be around 5pm) I was genuinely terrified of attractive girls and would plan for an entire week just to say one sentence to them. This would last for the next 5 years, so an IMMENSE amount of loneliness, depression and isolation came into my life.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today *-&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \[4/23/2019\]* After seven years of socializing, my anxiety with talking to people is 100% better. I genuinely enjoy getting to know them and would rather spend my free time doing so. I've gone to therapy for three years now, so I have been able to mentally understand things in life with more control! BUTT, isolation, loneliness, and anxiety and depression still hits me hard... every single day. That feeling of being the weird ""home schooled"" kid always comes back. Every time I've ever try asking someone out, even if I confidently talked and made them previously laugh in the past, that anxiety comes flooding back. My mind and body turns into jello and that person instantly sees it. My success rate of asking people out has been a solid 0.5%. I know we're all supposed to learn from our mistakes and failures, so there is an undeniable consistent mistake I'm making that I feel is related to... well.. my past?

&amp;#x200B;

I always feel desperate to socialize. Desperate to find that significant other... and that's just not how it works. It's taken me a long time to realize that, but fuck... it hasn't made much of a difference anyway. I spend all of my time trying to be creative , hoping to receive validation from my efforts there... but that has just felt like avoiding the core problem.

&amp;#x200B;

**SO TLDR LONG STORY SHORT ENDING QUESTION:**

&amp;#x200B;

**I have never learned how to self love throughout my entire life due to being homeschooled/isolated my entire childhood. I need it. Without it, the desperation of socialization just pushes people away, which leads to my consistent feelings of alienation and loneliness. I cannot process how the fuck to reverse this shit, it's infuriating. If one can be traumatized from isolation, what do you do to start improving that situation?**

This was really long, woops. If you've read this far and have had experience or similar feelings, I would be really interested to hear about them!",23Apr2019,2
