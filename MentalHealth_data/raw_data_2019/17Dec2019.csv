0,"Right now I'm not doing great. I'll give some details:

(*DISCLAIMER* I'm not going to perform anything said in this post by the way. I have OCD and sometimes obsess over unhealthy ideas. But I still have ideal morals)

I feel depressed much of the time but also pretty energetic too (I have a diagnosis of Bipolar). My meds usually work great but not so much now seemingly. I'm pretty angry a lot.
I'm obsessed at the moment with dangerous weapons. I have no clue as to why. I have been studying chemistry for a couple of months for maybe up to 15 hours a day. I'm obsessed with any sort of exothermic reaction; especially thermite reactions. Potential poisons and acids too and also homemade explosives such as molotovs or homemade fragmentation explosives. I often think about setting things alight etc etc.

I don't think the worry is that I'll do anything dangerous. But because it's all I do nowadays - spend my time working out the ingredients needed, their molar masses and the enthalpy of a reaction to hopefully create a big reaction. I have found people giving me a worried look if they spot any equations laying around or If I mention it at all. I have been asked as to why I want to make thermite. I did tell her I don't want to make thermite; just do the equations.",17Dec2019,1
1,"I've noticed recently that I'm having a hard time finding the motivation to do the things I like. I'm not sure if it's depression as I've never been diagnosed. But this has been a month or so at least. I am in therapy currently as well but don't have another appt. Until after Christmas.

I used to do YouTube, I pole dance, I do sexwork. All these things I enjoy. But recently no matter how much I  WANT to do these things, I can't bring myself to do them. And when I do try, it just feels like a chore and I don't enjoy it and just want to be finished. And it's SO frustrating because I do WANT to do these things and enjoy them like I used to but I don't have the energy or motivation and they're not as enjoyable as they used to be. 

I don't really know my point but I'm just so frustrated and isn't making anything easier because I remind myself ""Don't force it because you really wont like it then"" butalso I just want to have a good time doing the things I used to have a good time doing.",17Dec2019,1
2,"Any suggestions on dealing with triggers affecting you? Mine send me into spirals of anxiety and depression.

My Mom is a huge narcissist. It's insane how she gets if I inconvenience her in the slightest - yelling over me, throwing a fit, almost running out the room, or just ignoring me. It's gotten to the point I don't feel comfortable talking to her about anything that doesn't interest her. I don't even talk about my feelings or my day bc she turns everything on me or makes fun of me. She says ANYTHING to rile me up or get some reaction out of me. I'm 26 and she treats me like a child. She's blatantly bullies me, has blocked me from getting my social security looked into, and refused to take me to get disability since I'm partially blind. She's even convinced partial blindness doesn't mean I can't learn how to drive and wants me to teach myself. Which I'm pretty sure is NOT good.

I feel trapped. I've done my best to stay strong but it's gotten to the point I need to stand up for myself on issues. She's springing events on me lately and it's not good. 

I don't know what to do. I feel like silence isn't doing it anymore. The only time I've gotten her to back off is when she was exploding over me asking to go to the social security officer again. I stayed calm and collected while she stomped and screamed. Then she left the room, only to return few seconds later and apologize. Which, from what I understand is classic narcissist behavior.

Any help? Suggestions?",17Dec2019,1
3,"I went to the bar with some friends, chatting with my best friend and having few drinks. After a while my best friend found someone else to talk to, so I tried to talk to my other friend but I just felt so abandoned and lonely that I left. I said I was going to the bathroom and then proceeded to go home because I felt so lonely and out of place. Half an hour later one of them texted me asking where I was... Eventually I came back to the bar and we drove home together. So I ruined everyone's evening because I felt lonely and decided to leave without notice... Things like that are exactly why I hate myself",17Dec2019,1
4,"I am starting to wonder if it will ever be possible to internalize my self-worth. I have done a lot of therapy over the years and I understand that I am a worthwhile person with good qualities in my logical mind, but it rarely feels true. What's more the more aware I am of the fact that I'm insecure, the more insecure I feel. When people point it out, it makes me feel like I am just inherently worse than they are as a person. I sometimes have a hard to hearing criticism without wanting to point out a flaw in the person criticizing me because it feels like if I just accept their criticism then it proves that I am actually just worse than them and that they don't have any bad qualities.

At the end of the day I know I have plenty of good qualities and that many of my more confident friends have their own deep issues. However emotionally I constantly feel like/react as if I am really worthless.

At some point I just started to wonder: is this basically a permanent condition that never goes away and if so is there anyway to counteract the negative effects of it? I constantly struggle to actually hear/remember anything positive said about me and can't seem to forget the negative.

It's exhausting. Thanks for listening",17Dec2019,1
5,"I'm very concerned about my friend who is kind of refusing help for their mental health issue; they tried using the services provided at our school and they didn't have a positive/helpful experience, so they refuse on getting help again. I've been trying to help them keep up with schoolwork and making sure that they've been eating/drinking/sleeping regularly, but I'm not sure what else to do because they don't really reach out to anyone for long stretches of time except for me on occasion, and that's only if I ask them how they're doing. They've told me a lot of the stuff that they dealt with in life and since entering college, and I think they'd benefit from counseling/therapy, though they're having a hard time right now just taking care of themselves and I'm just trying my best to support them while they're going through it.

7,"I’m not trying to “flex” but I am a small online content creator and I am always positive about mental health. I needed a break as recently everything’s went downhill and I started cutting again.

8,"Age: 17
Gender: F
Diagnosed psychiatric disorders: General anxiety, Social anxiety, Major depression, and PTSD 

I’ve been dissociating for several months now nonstop. I constantly have holes in my memory, nothing feels real, I feel separated from everything I care about and everyone I care about, when I look in the mirror I feel more like the girl trapped behind glass instead of the real person who’s looking in the mirror, I feel like I’m floating outside my body, I’m lost, I’m completely numb, I’m unmotivated, I’ve lost interest in absolutely everything, I’m constantly fatigued, and I can’t focus. I don’t feel alive and I can’t stand it.

I’ve talked to my psychiatrist, but he told me medication won’t help me. I’ve talked to my psychologist but she’s only told me a few techniques regarding my physical symptoms that haven’t helped. She says that there are cognitive treatments but she refuses to treat my dissociation cognitively because she said it would be too distressing for me. She says the same thing about treating my PTSD. She doesn’t realize that id rater feel something horrible to get to a place where I feel okay as opposed to nothing at all. 

I probably sound like I’m being over-dramatic and tbh I probably am but I still, I just can’t take this anymore. I’m going absolutely no where. I feel like I’m not going to get into college and it’s my senior year, just because I’m not motivated to complete my applications. Until the beginning of junior year, I was known to pull regular all nighters to get school work done and to study. I took hard classes and I was an over-achiever even thought I dealt with A.D.D. which made things extremely difficult. I once went 120 hours without sleep because I couldn’t stop obsessing over everything being perfect. That might sound like a bad thing but really, my work ethic was my favorite thing about myself. I would do anything to get that back. But even more, I would give anything to get myself back— my passions, my friends, my aspirations, everything. I would give anything to bring meaning back to my life. Now I’m in under average classes and if teachers gave me what I really deserved I’d be failing everything. Like I said I’m going absolutely no where I’m completely stuck. Nothing ever makes sense. I feel like a corpse. I know this probably sounds dumb, but what really tells me something is wrong is that my dogs have always meant the world to me. I couldn’t wait to get home to find them waiting for me and hug them all. Now, when I get home I just want them to leave me alone. I still love them but I don’t have the energy to show it. Anyways, I really just can’t take it anymore. I have a history of Suicide attempts. I constantly have suicidal thoughts but I’m not actively suicidal at the moment. I don’t want to hurt my family and friends, but sleeping is truly the only thing I look forward to these days. I wish nobody cared about me so I could kill myself without hurting anyone. But I have no idea what I can do to get out of it.

I know I just sound like another petty teen and I know I probably am. My problems aren’t any worse than anyone else’s, but that doesn’t change how I feel.       

Also no residency or psychiatric unit will accept me— trust me my psychiatrist has tried several places following Suicide attempts and just in general , but nobody will accept me due to medical problems I have. There’s a specific hospital not too far from where I live that deals with patients with coexisting mental problems and medical problems like mine. And this hospital has accepted me several times, but my insurance has refused to pay for each time I’ve been accepted. 


I’ve lost all expectations for myself but I still have some hope things could get better. I just don’t know how to get out of this brain fog. I don’t know if it’s possible and I’m running out of time. 

If anyone has any suggestions I’d really appreciate it. Thanks for taking the time to read this!",17Dec2019,1

10,"So I'm 16f and my whole life I've been odd I guess. That's what other people say about me atleast. Ever since I could remember I've thought about killing my mother. Basically for no reason. When I was younger I would think about just putting chemicals in her food, then it escalated to making her overdose on her medication. It would be fairly easy because I've tried it and its tasteless so I would just crush as many tablets in her food as possible. But now that I'm older the thoughts have gotten worse in a way, they are more frequent. Now I think about slitting her throat, pushing her down the stairs, etc. I've lost count of the amount of scenarios I've thought of that involved killing her and the dispose of the body, how I would cover it up, if i would alert the cops myself and act as if she went missing. Quite honestly the only thing that's kept me from doing it is the fact that I have no family or friends to live with if I did get away with it and I dont want to go into foster care for 2 years. I'm just using her until I'm 18 and then I'm going to cut contact with her completely. 

But aside from this problem I always get told about how when I was a child I was very quiet. I almost never talked and would constantly find places to hide. I can remember that I didnt even have friends until 7th grade, and even now I have very few because i never approach people and if someone approaches me i never let them stay around for long.

I've had one relationship but I wouldnt really consider it one. I'd never had a boyfriend and just wanted to see what it was like. He would constantly want to hug and kiss and it disgusted me. It got to the point that he cheated on me because I didnt want any physical contact with him but even then I didnt care and stayed with him for a few more months because i got tired of him asking me to try. I dont really know how to put this but I feel the need to be touched but when someone tried I make them stop because it disgust me. And his age didnt help. Not sure why but I'm only attracted to older men, when I say that I like to think it's just because of maturity but theres probably another reason I just havent thought of yet.

Another thing is I think I dont have emotions, or if I do their mixed up? I guess that's the way to describe it. Most of the time I feel neutral(that's just what I say when I dont feel anything). The only time I feel something is when I'm mad. My arms start shaking and my eyes tear up. The only expression I have is smiling or just my resting face. But when I smile it's not because I'm happy, it's just because I dont know what else to do with my face, people always say I look sad or angry so I smile because hearing that all the time aggravates me. I also smile when its completely inappropriate, for example someone talking about a loved ones death, when I'm getting yelled at, when someone cries infront of me. 

That's all the problems I can think of at the moment, I dont think it's normal or maybe it is I'm not really sure.  But I just wanted to know if there was anyone who's also like this. I dont really have anyone to talk to about this stuff. I've tried therapy but It didnt really help.",17Dec2019,1

15,"I’m (16F) unable to let go of my eating disorder and the disordered habits that come with it. I’ve been stuck living with anorexia for almost 3 years now and I can’t seem to move on with my life and I am unable to get external help.

I’ve always been a bit underweight; always smaller and skinnier than the rest of my class. Coming from an Asian background, skinny culture is extremely popular and I was always praised for having tiny legs and waist. The difference between now and then is that now I am skinny because I restrict. Before it was all natural. I deteriorated mentally somewhere around the age of 14 and I lost my sense of self worth. I thought that the only thing I was good at was being skinny and losing weight. I lost over 14 kgs and went down to a bmi 14.5 before being forced into gaining back some weight.

My family and friends thought that after gaining back half the weight I lost, I would have been recovered. That’s not the case; I’ve never been more obsessed with the idea of losing weight. My school contacted the authorities and they forced my dad to sign me up for a psychiatrist and a psychologist, but he doesn’t want to do that because he doesn’t think I have a problem.

You see my family is engulfed in the idea that we are perfect. So the thought of me having a problem is unheard of. I’ve cried to them asking to get help, but they have always undermined me and called me insane for suggesting such extreme ideas. My dad kept saying that there is something wrong with my brain and that I have a defect; that I am a defect and that I should be ashamed. My mom has told me to “go starve for the next week because my death would mean absolutely nothing.” To hear this kind of thing, it almost fuels my eating disorder more.

I get so much support from friends though. My boyfriend is especially encouraging, and yet I still disappoint them by fluctuating in weight. The thing is I would like to recover and eat normally, but I seem to like my body and where it is at now than i do my health. Without like an external support forcing me against my will to gain weight, i feel incapable of doing it on my own and therefore stuck. I can’t see myself ever enjoying meals in the future and I feel like I’ll have this stupid eating disorder for the rest of my life - and I don’t want that. I recognize that everything I am doing at the moment is completely irrational, but I just can’t seem to leave it behind me. I feel safe with anorexia as well as discontent. I just can’t make that first move on my own behalf.",17Dec2019,1
16,"I think I have some kind of mental disorder. Normally, I wouldn’t go to social media over something like this, but I feel like I have no other options and I really need help. I can’t control my emotions. One minute I could be feeling okay, and then the next I’m extremely angry or sad or scared and it’s sometimes over nothing or tiny things. I sometimes get extremely sad and I cry out of nowhere. I don’t feel happy at all anymore, it’s either my emotions are negative or that I’m just feeling neutral, almost kind of empty, or just okay. I tend to get scared, or anxious or nervous from the smallest things, like reading and answering questions in my classes or talking to people in general. I’ll start shaking and getting dizzy and nauseous, and sometimes I feel like crying because it’s so out of nowhere. I used to resort to hurting myself to help, and I ended up stopping, but now I sometimes end hurting myself like before, only worse than before. I know it’s not good, but it’s the only thing I’ve felt helps me, and it makes me so afraid. Sometimes, I’ve even thought about killing myself, but I never actually go through with it. I feel ashamed by all of this. I don’t mean to be this way, I don’t like it at all, I just don’t know how to control myself, but all I know is that I do need help. I remember telling my parents about this once because we had gotten into an argument and I ended up blowing up on them. They got angry at me and kept telling me that I was being disrespectful and giving them an attitude for no reason. When I tried to explain how it wasn’t my fault and everything I said before they said I was just getting all of this off from the internet and that it was putting stuff in my head that was making me think all these things. I have done research but it was only because I was afraid I was going to hurt myself or someone else badly. I don’t have anyone to talk to who understands, and I used to have a therapist when I was about to graduate elementary school but that was only for behavioral issues, and I felt pressured to talk to him. I was uncomfortable and I felt like I was being judged with everything I would tell her, or that she wasn’t taking what I was telling her seriously. I’m a freshman in high school now and I feel like I’m only getting worse. I want to get help just incase I really do have a mental disorder that could get worse over time. I feel really alone in this problem and like no one understand what I’m going through. I know that there are people who have it worse, and that I’m not the only one going through issues, but it’s at the point where I feel like I really won’t be able to do this much longer. All I want to do is get better, to be like other people who seem so happy, who have lots of friends and are confident and in control of themselves, but I know I won’t be able to do this without help, and I don’t know how to get it.",17Dec2019,1

I have had depression for 10 years now and it's really weighing down on me. I've PTSD and ADD as well but they're not much of an issue anymore. The problem I've been having is I feel like I am slowly losing my mind. 

Sometimes, I can't tell the difference between reality and my imagination. I'm forgetting things that happened and remembering things that never happened very vividly. I am in a lot of pain all the time. Recently, I've began to go into bursts of uncontrollable crazy sounding laughter then just stop suddenly. Sometimes I can't tell if I just laughed or not but I'll see people look at me weirdly when I'm in public. 

I get very sudden mood swings sometimes. I can't control my anger anymore. I have suicidal and murderous thoughts almost habitually. I've lost all sense of consequence, time and logic.  I can't reason with myself anymore. I know it's wrong but I don't see the problem in things like getting kicked out of school or getting into head on collisions. I don't notice day or night anymore. 

It doesn't seem real but I am pretty sure I received a letter in the mail saying I got kicked out of school. I think I broke up with my fiancee too although the more I think about it, the more fictional he seems. One think I know for sure is I got fired from my job for not showing up.

30,"Hi! Hopefully that title drew in a couple readers to this otherwise tawdry announcement. Tho I have occasionally taken to exactly what title describes, I’m moreover a person that needs to see control and understanding to feel close to comfortable. Not necessarily my control or understanding, but just that somebody in the room is confident they know what the fuck is going on. Kind of like a focal point or a stabilizing bar. More and more over the years though I’ve come to see less and less of that and have had to resort to being my own focalizing representation of stable understanding and control over what reality I perceive. 

Now, after many years of not being able to find any one or anything that I can’t pick out glaring flaws of philosophy, notice the subtle misstep of false confidence and pick up on the slight inconsistencies of deception I find myself questioning the legitimacy of my interaction with everyone I meet and even the relationships of ppl I’ve known my whole life. I feel sometimes as though there’s a grand and clandestine conspiracy in motion that it’s instigators and operatives are trying to covertly force me into a way of life I abhor, lull me into complacency with standards I reject, and abide the will of those I despise.

To keep things short and close, I’ll get to this little announcement. Last week I inadvertently rolled the dice on something that depending on how the pips read could either make a devastating impact on my near future and entire life, or could simply make it slightly easier for me to move past some events in my past. Whatever happens, I know I’ll never feel comfortable in my own skin and I’ll forever be looking over my shoulder for these horrible tormentors that feel justified in their haunting, goading, persuading, taunting, harassment.

My life as a thinking and feeling being is over. Replaced by the life of a being that has more resembled a programmed automaton with malfunctions to be repaired. Unless I take this rolling of dice as a catalyst to playing with no fear and unabashed defiance of anyone’s control over me or narrow judgment of my actions. Not everyone’s purpose in life is to create or win. Some of us are here to defy. Maybe my purpose is to defy and I’ve only been looking for what it is that I need to try my best to knock down and disrupt as much as I can before I inevitably lose.",17Dec2019,1
31,"So for some reason (not sure if it’s my depression coming up or I’m just hormonal) I get very sad and down and at my worst like at the start of my period (last time it lasted 2 weeks and then suddenly stopped?) I can’t function at all during that time either, and I’m a wreck. I’ve been diagnosed with depression (and OCD but idk if thats relevant or not.) and I’m taking meds. I’m pretty much fine otherwise. I doubt it’s even depression but I want to know if I should keep an eye out for it. I’m starting to get these feelings again (I’m going on my period again) and it’s stressing me out. Especially since I have all these deadlines coming up and I don’t want this bull to get in the way haha. Advice? I’m a senior in high school.",17Dec2019,1
32,"Fu*k this Generalized anxiety disorder. I wish I was devoid of emotions. I don't wanna feel anything. I wanna stop caring about everything. I wanna be apathetic.
.
No pain when you're detached from a heart. I want my heart to be thrown into an ocean for a shark to eat. I want to drown along with it.
.
I wanna accept how cold and harsh reality is, and to be cold and harsh along with it. To stop living inside of daydreams and to stop relying on hope. 
.
I should just be cold, very cold. I should just be heartless. I think life is better lived that way, don't you think? I'm not fit for this world. I'm weaker then weak. 
.
Too weak. Too warm. Too emotional. Too caring. Too hopeful. Too naive. Too frightful to live. If I was any other animal, I wouldn't be alive right now cause natural selection would've taken its place.
.
My father is right about everything he said about me tonight, all those things I hate him for saying. I deserved it when I got strangled by him. Like when he told me how anyone would have to have an IQ of 60 to want me around for example lol.
.
He's right even though he's a piece of sh*t for it. Even though he deserves to rot just like I deserve to rot. I should tear my own heart out. I'm tired of feeling. 
.
I hope the judge sends my fathers violent autistic son to Jail tomorrow. I hope my father gets to feel the pain I felt when I got abused by my brother who got excused from everything he did to me, and that I paid for by the misery I got put through day after day.
.
I hope my brother pays for what he did to all of us. All the times I was made fun of for having the cops at the house every single night. I could've lived life better. I could've been happier. I could've been mentally healthy if I had a nicer family.
.
And that's fu*ked up how nobody cared about the pain I went through, but the minute some random chick in a LADD home gets slapped open handed and feels ""scared for her life"" when she KNEW what work she was getting into. When a cop gets kicked in the leg after he beats the sh*t out of my brother ALL SH*T BREAKS LOOSE. 
.
Like fu*k them, I got hurt 100x worse then that every single day and everyone was aware of my pain including the cops. Nothing happens till the pus*ies get a lil hurt lol. 
.
I want to drown myself, but maybe that's too easy. I'm so angry at the world. I'm so angry. It's just constant agony now. I feel like I can't escape this life. Everything is a sick joke, and I'm just laughed at.
.
I want to hurt everyone around me including myself. I feel like I'm in my own personal version of hell that I will never climb out of. I just want to kill off the agony.",17Dec2019,1
33,"There is my therapist who says that I need to go with people, be with them and long story short had to stop being that self-centered. Okay, I have spend my hole life pretending. Or I think I have spent my hole life pretending I was sociable, flawless and careless, calm and all. Now she says it's not because we behave differently with parents/friends/stangers etc that we are out of ourself. Yeah. I get it. But I think she's missing a point. 

It's right when you know at least a little who you are. Or what define what you are. But there is just an empty shell. My real persona is an a--- who don't care for other. I had learnt every little social tricks (family bonds, friends, I'm bad at lover and all) I though was good enough to pass myself as a good guy. Or at least a basic one.  

Is it because I'm lazy and bored and do nothing to take care of it ?

To blend myself in a new environnement I just dropped what I like to do (chilling doing nothing, play games, dissociating, drawing...) and focused on work. This is my anchor. Working. 

But I'm an empty potato living because the original plans of life has failed : don't live past my 25 max. So I'm lost and cringy. 

Perfect blend of life. I envy people who genuily do things meaningfully. I'm so pessimistic that I don't want to be involve in their life. No trace. No existence. Nothing. I want to leave and magically disapear from earth. But science is here leaving every particles in this pure air. 

I know I have been non diagnosed/diagnosed as depressive guy. A long time ago when I was still studying. I had say it was alright. Have my way with it. Now I'm tired. I have trapped my own mind to live. Because it hurt. Living is painful.

This might seem like a small thing, but it feels big for me. I normally tell people that I'm doing fine and always try to smile and joke with everybody no matter how bad I'm actually feeling. Even when I talk to my friends about my problems, I try to downplay it in a way that makes them think I'm still happy overall. Today was possibly one of the first times I've admitted to a friend that I'm not happy. 

I've been feeling myself slip farther from happiness the past few months. Admitting that I'm not happy but that I can strive for happiness was a huge relief.

36,"I posted on here a while ago about how I am a nurse in a psychiatric emergency department and I got burnout/hit my trauma threshold and wasn’t able to work anymore. 
I had to take a month off from work and then I spent 8 weeks slowly exposing myself back to my work environment. 2 hours the first week, then 4, then 6, then 8, and finally 10. 
At the 6h a week I truly thought I was going to have to quit fully. It was very hard and very draining and during this time I wasn’t even doing any nursing duties. Just sitting in the nursing station while I worked on updating our resource binder.  
On the Friday of my 6 hour week I almost didn’t go to work, like I said I was ready to give up and quit, but I knew that if I stayed home I would just mope around all day feeling shitty so I decided that it was better to feel shitty at work and get paid. And this is when it all turned around.  
Pushing through the shitty feeling allowed my brain to finally re-wire itself and know that I don’t have to be in panic mode at work. 
And while it’s still hard at times it’s nothing like it used to be and now I’m not letting my fear control me. 
I am now working my second shift back at full duties and I’m just really proud of myself and my stubborn pride in getting myself back to work.",17Dec2019,1
37,"I don't know where else to post this or who I can ask for advice.

I am a 22 year old female about to graduate college in the spring. I moved out of my mom's house (and halfway across the country) when I was 18 and have been living independently since. However, over these past 4 years, I have nightmares about my mom being abusive to me at least once a week and I really want them to stop.

My mom was extremely strict in raising my brothers and me. All of her parenting was a result of the fact that she takes the Bible very literally. She would often quote the scripture: ""God says to beat your children; it will not kill them."" And she was definitely a fan of spanking when I was a kid. I am the middle child and only girl and my mom didn't have to spank me much because I was so afraid of her that I tried to behave. However, my brothers didn't always listen and I watched them get spanked a lot, especially my youngest brother.

Once, I remember my older brother and I hiding in the hallway listening to my mom flip out on our younger brother for something he did. We decided to count how many spanks he got, and we counted 26. I hated seeing my brothers get beat more than I feared getting spanked myself.

I never thought of my mom as abusive. She was a single mother of three children and did her best, even if tough-love was the only way she knew how.

Now, to the dreams. My mom was extremely strict on me in high school when it came to boys and dating. I couldn't date until I was 17, and even then the dates had to be me bringing the guy to our church. This was humiliating so I didn't bother with boys much. My mom always preached that I must wait until marriage to have sex. The church taught me that even masturbating was a sin.

A lot of my dreams involve my mom finding out/walking in on my boyfriend and I making out or having sex, followed by her chasing me with a knife or threatening to punch me in the face. She would NEVER do either of these things, which makes the dreams more disturbing.

Last night I dreamt that she found a poem I had written on my childhood kitchen table and said to me ""oh, you think you're going to be a poet, do you?"" In this really snarky voice (still unrealistic, although she was always kind of snooty about me wanting to go to college). When I told her she didn't have to be mean about it, she was like ""what was that?"" and started chasing me around the house so she could beat me. This is reflective of most of the years I lived with her; she was constantly grounding me for talking back or being mouthy, when in most cases my talking back was just asking her to logically explain her parenting choices.

My mom and i have a decent relationship now. I see her twice a year for holidays, and we talk on the phone every few months. She is way more chill than she was growing up, and I want to forgive her for everything and move on, but these constant nightmares stress me out and serve as reminders of the life I used to have under her thumb. I don't know what to do anymore. Thanks for reading.",17Dec2019,1

44,"Benefits Of Learning and Playing Music For Adults
Posted Fri Dec 13
June 01, 2014 Sharon Bryant
Music in the News Music Education Foundation News

More Benefits and Facts:

Music therapy was recently found to reduce psychological stress in a study of 236 pregnant women (College of Nursing at Kaohsiung Medical University in Taiwan)
Playing music reduces stress and has been shown to reverse the body’s response to stress at the DNA-level (Dr. Barry Bittman).
Playing music “significantly” lowered the heart rates and calmed and regulated the blood pressures and respiration rates of patients who had undergone surgery (Bryan Memorial Hospital in Lincoln, Neb., and St. Mary’s Hospital in Mequon, Wis.)
Blood samples from participants of an hour-long drumming session revealed a reversal of the hormonal stress response and an increase in natural killer cell activity (Bittman, Berk, Felten, Westengard, Simonton, Pappas, Ninehouser, 2001, Alternative Therapies, vol. 7, no. 1).
Anger Management Music therapy can help people identify the emotions that underlie anger and increase the patient’s awareness of these feelings and situations that can trigger them. If a situation or emotion is presented in a song the healthy options for expressing that feeling can be discussed and conflict resolution and problem solving can be practiced in a positive manner.
Drumming is also used by music therapists to help patients appropriately vent anger and other emotions. Another use of drumming can be a non-verbal conversation on drums where the ability to listen to the other person’s drumming is needed to “converse” on the drums.
Playing a musical instrument can reverse stress at the molecular level, according to studies conducted by Loma Linda University School of Medicine and Applied Biosystems (as published in Medical Science Monitor).
Making music can help reduce job burnout and improve your mood, according to a study exposing 112 long-term care workers to six recreational music-making sessions of group drumming and keyboard accompaniment. (As published in “Advances in Mind-Body Medicine”) Engaging in playing music reduces depression. Recent research with long-term care workers showed reduced depression (21.8 percent) six weeks after the completion of a music-making program consisting of one hour per week (Source: A 2003 study conducted by Trip Umbach Healthcare Consulting, Inc.).
Parkinson’s Disease and Stroke: Rhythmic cues can help retrain the brain after a stroke or other neurological impairment, according to Michael Thaurt, director of Colorado State University’s Center of Biomedical Research in Music.
Researchers have also discovered that hearing slow, steady rhythms, such as drumbeats, helps Parkinson patients move more steadily (Friedman, “Healing Power of the Drum,” 1994).
Cancer Subjects who participated in a clinical trial using the HealthRhythms protocol showed an increase in natural killer cell activity and an enhanced immune system. While this does not indicate a cure for cancer, such results may be of benefit for those facing this disease. (Bittman, Berk, Felten, Westengard, Simonton, Pappas, Ninehouser, 2001, Alternative Therapies, vol. 7, no. 1).
Playing music increases human growth hormone (HgH) production among active older Americans. The findings revealed that the test group who took group keyboard lessons showed significantly higher levels of HgH than the control group of people who did not make music (University of Miami).

Like the title said, i only feel alive is when im hurt not physically but emotionally. I don't have a purpose or a vision in life like i did before, beside that nothing makes me happy anymore.
I've been through a heartbreak, it was so bad that i cried myself to bed for weeks. But i kinda miss those days, i only feel alive when im going through extreme or hard core emotions.
I got a lot of suicidal thoughts but im too much of a pussy to hurt myself in anyway.
I think the problem is that i never loved myself, and i always needed others to live. And now since everyone left me ( Friends, Ex, ... ) i feel like i have no purpose in this life.
If anyone can help me resolve this issue or advice me that would be very nice !",17Dec2019,1
46,"Last September, I suddenly have two growing cyst under my arm and later became open wounds. I had to do wound cleaning everyday and went to the clinic to see the doctor. I was prescribed antibiotics and the doctor told me if the wounds get worse, go to the hospital. A few weeks later, the wound healed but open up again. I was referred to the hospital and since I'm not citizen, I only have basic private insurance cover which doesn't cover hospital bills unless I was admitted. The medical bill costs so much and I was shocked. I begged for the clerk to bill me instead of paying at the time hoping to buy some time for the payment. I also went to see the doctor anyway because I thought I needed surgeries. But the hospital doctor then prescribed me another antibiotic. I was upset because the hospital bill was so expensive but all I got was antibiotics. Then I finished the antibiotics and again, healed but open up again. 

So I went to the hospital the second time because I thought this time I'm going to get surgeries. I went there and this time the fees is a little less but still too high for me which made my knees weak. I paid only a little and asked the rest to be billed. I went to see the doctor and again, the hospital doctor prescribed me antibiotics but this time longer term antibiotics (20 days). I was very upset because I was worried about the fees. A few weeks later the bills came and I emailed them begging if I could pay installments instead. Luckily they agreed. I graduated and I'm still unemployed trying to find work. I'm living in another country which is a bit hard on hiring. My dad is supporting me so far but he told me his money is running out and I'm stressing out so much. After the hospital visit, I finished the 20 days antibiotics, the wounds still doesn't heal. 

This time, if I went the third time, I know I'm going to get surgeries because it was stated in the discharge letter, but it's too expensive to go back. So instead I went to see the clinic doctor that I first mentioned. The doctor was upset that the hospital did not do the surgeries and my skin at this point, has scaring, darkened and dry because I have to do wound cleaning everyday. It means, I have to clean and change sterile band-aid everyday which also costs me. The doctor then told me I have no choice but to get surgeries. The doctor then referred me to a private dermatologist. Deep down, I know I won't go because I really can't afford it. The clinic's reception then told me that my insurance did not cover my first visit fees and this time, I have to pay the full price for this visit. I had no choice but pay and later I only had $20 to buy groceries for the whole week. I bought a few frozen food and I was left with $0.16 in my account. I went home and cried my eyes out because I just feel so defeated. The private dermatologist reception later called me to schedule an appointment, I told her I can't afford it now and would call back if I can. I secretly know I can't go so I just change my wound cleaning everyday. This week, I also decide to fast and only eat dinner, skipping breakfast and lunch to cut down spending. 

Recently, I also found out that my dad is secretly seeing someone a few years after that my mum has passed from cancer. I know my dad have that rights and he was a good person but it still really broke my heart because I saw my mum suffered on her last seconds on earth. Growing up I always admire my parents love for each other and wished someday I can experience such love too. When my mum was ill, she made my dad promised not to find another after she passed and my dad promised. Idk why she made him promised, maybe she secretly know it will break me and my brother's hearts. Or maybe our family. See, I understand my dad is lonely and he needed to move on, but I really can't help to feel so sad because it made me feel like people can easily be replaced. And what I admired about their love growing up and they went through so much together but that's just the fantasy of the past. I've always known my dad to be an honest man but now he's secretly seeing someone, he lied to my brother about his whereabouts and all that. Seeing him changed saddens me. My family is the biggest reason why I'm happy and now I feel like the world is upside down. I keep having anxiety rush and my fingers feels cold every time I think about dad seeing someone. 

I also recently made the effort to create a gofundme campaign in hopes to get help on my medical bills. But too embarrassed to share it to my personal social network. I'm sure you understand when you have a very personal problem and not wanting your family, relatives and friends to know. That's how I feel. So I did not share the campaign which means I did not receive any donations so far. But if anyone can help directly, please do, [paypal.me/maz456](https://paypal.me/maz456). I'm sorry if I seem shameless sharing paypal but I really need all the help I can get at this point. 

I feel like I'm dealing with so much right now and spent most times feeling hopeless, worthless and stuck. I keep thinking about suicide because I want to stop this constant bad feeling and the anxiety is torture. And also, I really really miss my mum. I wish I can talk to her and hug her until all my problems and worries just melt away. But I really don't want to put my family through another death again. I still love my dad and I don't want to leave my brother alone now that mum's gone. Although he has a family and he's my big brother but still, we're the only siblings we had and we always rely on each other about everything. I feel so stuck in life and I honestly don't know what to do, where to go and how my life will unfold. I just hope a miracle happens and things will look up soon. For me and everyone out there who are in need. Thank you so much for reading and please pardon my grammar mistakes.",17Dec2019,1

48,"Hey guys, I don’t know if this is the right page for this or what so sorry in advance. 

I have a friend, we hang out all the time with our group of friends and a lot of the times we drink watch sports just normal stuff every weekend. So me and my friends started noticing this about a year ago but basically one of our friends starts to coming up with crazy lies and crazy stories when we hang out or go out. For example one time he called one of us and said he stabbed someone ( which he didn’t) and came up with a crazy lie that cops were outside his house with guns drawn. We had another friend drive by his house and there was nothing there. Another lie would be saying some random guy that we went to highschool with 5 years ago and haven’t talked to or seen in years was saying shit about his sister and he got us kicked out of the club, the crazy part was that the guy “talking shit” wasn’t even at the club. And then he’d proceed to go to random people on the street and say it was that guy who was talkin shit and we’d have to try to calm him down. And the latest lie yesterday, we were all hanging out in a hotel room, drinking all night but no one was super drink everyone was just chillin talking and he faked a phone call with some guys that we don’t like saying that they want to fight. The call was so in depth and he’d have fake conversations yelling stuff into the phone but the phone call wasn’t even real. But he made the phone call seem so real like a real conversation and it seemed so real and well thought out. This has happened on many occasions. These lies and stories are so In depth.

So idk we’ve talked to him and he just says he doesn’t remember or stuff like that and brushes it off. 

does anyone know what this means? Is it a form of mental illness? i’ve looked up symptoms and seen psychosis and schizophrenia. we as friends are getting worried and think it might be getting serious and out of hand. Any idea on what this could be or the next steps in helping a friend out? Thanks",17Dec2019,1
49,"What Im officially Diagnosed with 

-Depression
-Anxiety 

What I also likely have although it's a secret

-Mania
- Paranoid Schizophrenia 
- Solipsism syndrome


I got put on antipsychotics, anti anxiety pills, anti depressants and a second kind of antipsychotics after a trip or two to the phych ward. The first trip was semi voluntary, I say that because they asked me when I had just woken up from a coma and barely knew left from right, earlier that day I was laughing at a nonexistent tv show playing on the wall. My odd behavior in the ward led them to them suspecting I have mania, anxiety and depression although they couldn't prove all of it. I do however have several mental health issues I've kept a secret as I listed above. I stopped taking my medications after my second round at the ward as sort of a test. What I found was that I started hearing voices, hallucinating, lost track of reality slightly and had horrible nightmares. I started taking one of my prescribed  antipsychotic medications but that's all. When I'm off my meds I'm extremely unstable and while I'm not a danger to anyone else I typically get extremely suicidal. There was a while when I just sort of let the voices tell me what to do and stopped making decisions for myself. They wouldn't speak all the time, more like whispers when I was alone, giving commands and I always obliged. They never told me to do anything that would harm anyone, in fact quite the opposite. I often got told to help people and I became fixated on the idea of Karma. Anyway the reason I'm writing this is because I'm back on one of my antipsychotics, the voices and hallucinations are gone although I have a hard time believing anyone else is real. Does anyone else feel like this? Is there anything I can do about it?",17Dec2019,1
50,"Good evening people who read this page.

I'm having problems the last few days and I thought I might try to explain it to strangers on the internet with the hope of someone telling me I'm not crazy.

A small amount of backstory, 

I am an anxious person, I do a lot of overthinking and worrying. I also have a fear of heights. Airplanes make me anxious and I will absolutely drive 14 hours to get somewhere to avoid flying. I managed to avoid any type of air travel till I was 17 and have only taken 2 air trips in the 11 years since and those were because there was no other option. Pretty much white-knuckle the whole time.

Approximately 12 or 13 years ago, in high school, I began to get interested in Astronomy. So, I checked into different careers I could potentially follow and started reading about the topic itself.

One such book was about general concepts and the opening was something like 'so really, let's think about the stuff' and went on to say 'go outside at night and we will learn about some things' 
So I go outside and start reading the book, and it talks about where I am and what I'm seeing in the sky and all that. Then it starts to talk about the cosmos in general and the massive scale of it all. 

I don't really know the exact sentence that did it, but all of a sudden, my mind grabbed onto ""hey man, we're really high up in the air and not physically anchored to anything. If we just started falling right now, it would literally never stop.

I freaked tf out, shut the book and ran back inside the house. I immediately ceased any pursuit of astronomy. Ever since this happened, my mind will sometimes wander back to that thought, and if I'm not able to get off it and think of something else, I will start to feel the sensation of falling and I have to literally run around, because if I sit still, I'm certain I will have a heart attack. And if I'm feeling like I'm falling, that must mean the earth is moving in a way it shouldn't right? And if it starts to do that, it's never gonna stop, because its outer space, and that just keeps going and going and going

Flash forward to 2014, this really awesome looking movie is coming out with heavy space themes. It really looks like a fantastic movie, but seeing space stuff tends to trigger the anxiety. I decide I'm gonna see it anyway.

It was an incredibly overwhelming and intense experience. I could not sleep at all that night, I kept having what I later learned people refer to as 'brain zaps' that kept me awake.  However, I found the story to also be incredibly emotionally impactful, and I decided I wanted to get some help.

I saw a doctor and they put me on an Rx for anxiety(12-2014). It was awesome. I wasn't thinking those things anymore or being overly worried about things I have no control over. 

Then at the beginning of this year, I start to feel anxious again, at first not too badly, but then I had a panic attack and I thought the Rx wasn't working anymore. I decided to stop taking it (this was sometime in June), so I spaced out the last 30 day supply till it was gone. I had some uncomfortable symptoms with stopping(like the brain zaps) but then those quit and I started to feel fine again. 

Now in December, I'm not feeling mentally well, I've had a number of key things happen that are completely normal, but difficult for me to process all at once and it feels like my brain has broken and I'm having the anxious 'earth falling' thoughts. They are preventing me from sleeping.

So, I want to find a way to deal with these thoughts on their own. Not being on the Rx I was given, I'm able to 'worry' about the things that I really should be worried about, whereas when I was on the Rx I made a lot of irresponsible choices because I wasn't anxious about the outcomes. ""Yolo"" was in full effect, I literally said that when I signed papers to buy a car. I want to be able to worry about the things I should worry about, rather than just kill all ability to worry. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I'm sorry if some of it doesn't make sense, I'm happy to try and clarify anything. I've never been good at long-form typing.

53,"Hey friends, 

Just a fair warning. I'm probably ( Definitely) Overreacting with this whole thing and it's probably nothing. 

So I had people over this week and I couldn't enjoy myself because I was extremely paranoid that they were going through my stuff and judging me. One girl did look through an old diary and my phone, so I've been extra cautious around her. I've decided that I hate having groups over, and i'm never doing that again. I don't necessarily have anything to hide from anybody, I just really hate people going through my stuff without my specific permission to do so. I also got annoyed that they weren't working when we were supposed to be for school and that they were being way too loud. Honestly, I just wanted them to go back home. I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression, but I was wondering if this is anything more than that? I hate being touched and being in loud, crowded spaces.  I don't like people looking at me, and I get kinda upset when people aren't doing what we're supposed to be doing. I can't really talk to people that well either if I don't start the conversation. Idk it's probably nothing, I just wanted to know if someone smarter than me out there knows if this is anything extra spicy. \*Jazz hands\*

54,"It all started about a year ago after a weird phase of a friendship between me and a friend (F17).   
Long story short: Got into a friendship with benefits when i was in love with this person and she didn't love me back. It ended up tearing me apart in the long term emotionally (was extremely depressed, some self-harm that didn't go too far) before we ended it when she got a boyfriend and then I did my best to move on from my feelings. I still talk to her and we are in good term but...  


The problem I'm facing right now and that I don't understand is that ever since those events I frequently get super intrusive thoughts that I clearly don't want to think about. I'll randomly start thinking about when me and this girl were having sex or just think about her and then feel a wave of panic and I'll have the urge to react to this sensation by either:  
\-Hitting myself when no one is around  
\-Cursing at myself for thinking this  
\-Saying to myself repetitively word like: stop, no   
\-Get highly agitated for no reason (jumping around, shaking my head, etc)  


I'm wondering what I should do about this. Right now this isn't preventing me from doing everyday tasks but it does happen pretty frequently, some time it will get worst than other. It mostly happen when I'm not doing anything to distract my mind like when I'm in the shower, in my room or just walking around. I need some advice.

61,"Oh, and I'm barely making even. My boyfriend, some commissions, and kind donations are helping me skirt by. 2019 is laying it on one layer of the shit cake after another.

My childhood cat, 20 years, passed away at home. It wrecked me. I still have trouble dealing with it. Shortly after, my two older ferrets passed away. Prior, my old bearded dragon passed away. 

Early 2019, my husband of 17 years and I went our separate ways on as friendly of terms as possible considering the circumstances (I can't work due to my disabilities, my disabilities aren't ""disability"" enough for actual disability), I got most of the house money and moved in with my now bf (no, there was no cheating, ex and I were poly) and his brother &amp; sister-in-law, and roommate. Paid off my student loans and other burdens. What was left only held me for a few months.

My ex father-in-law passed away, which made shit worse because I couldn't see my ex family members to help myself cope with that loss. My ex husband was in a bad relationship that critically fucked him up and his dad passing away was of no concern to his ex gf. She treated him like garbage. Ex-husband could not mourn properly because of her. 

Bf's bro and sister-in-law move, I bought their deep freezer, washer/dryer, and took on the rent/bills. That severely dented my finances which were already getting tough. 

Bf gets testicular cancer, surgery to remove the one massive testicle that was 97% tumor and the size of a large avocado. We try to take it all in stride, I take care of him while he heals. Doctors recommend chemo treatment just in case. They do another scan, he has small lumps in his lungs. Are they cancerous? Who knows! Insurance won't cover chemotherapy nor cover anymore scans. Boyfriend has since gained a concerning cough.

Got a call from my mother the day after Thanksgiving, she has cancer in her throat. She can't eat or drink, and relies on a feeding port in her stomach. Within two weeks of talking to her on the phone, I can now only barely understand what she's saying, it progressed so quickly that in two weeks she's unable to fucking talk because it's closing her airway. She went in again today, it's stages 1-3 but docs don't know exactly what cancer it is. Next tests are Wed.

Tonight, I received a call around 11pm from my stepmother that my dad is missing. He works in GA during the week and drives home to NC on weekends. The last I heard from him was two days ago about our upcoming visit to NC for Christmas. Apparently my stepmother drove to the GA residence to check on him because he said he wasn't feeling well. The car is gone, he took the dog and the dogs insulin, and won't answer texts or phone calls. I've tried calling and texting to no avail, dad and I are very close. My guess is he's driving to NC from GA. He may be asleep in a hotel. His phone maybe lost charge. But total silence.


I have fibromyalgia, narcolepsy, chronic fatigue, anxiety, and severe depression. I am fighting so goddamn hard this year to keep my shit together, to afford to pay my portion of bills, and feel guilty for relying on my bf to buy my food or medications. I'm thankful I'm not suicidal or an alcoholic or a user of drugs to cope. But Jesus I am so exhausted. I am at a limit of having gone totally numb. I'm not the kind of person who thinks therapy is unnecessary, it's incredibly useful for many folks, but it's not for me. I'm pretty good at figuring out problems and solving them on my own. It's just right now..I'm tired. I'm so tired. 

All I can wonder is what the fuck is going to happen next? 2019 isn't over yet.

They also quickly linked a therapist to being referred to medication at some point so it seems like I also lost the option for therapy (which I wasn't very willing to do anyways.)

I have nothing in my life with meaning, I am just a burden on my family, and I am completely ashamed of myself, 26 years old and I have nothing to show for it.

Last few months I have been having suicidal thoughts and ideations every day, nothing new for me, but as always I obsess over it. What should I do? because I have no idea...

I will be seeing my GP this wednesday, I know my doctors wont take me seriously if I say I am having suicidal thoughts, well they never did anything in the past, and wont prescribe me the medication I know I need, my country is very behind the times.

I have no hope anymore, well its been years since I had any, but for awhile I was semi coping, now I am withdrawing again, isolating myself and getting worse mentally.

I truly believe some people are not cut out for life, and I know I am one of them, I know people hate to hear that, but there comes a point where you think to yourself, what is the point? 

I have never had real job, and probably never will, I would rather die than do a job I hate doing to continue doing a job I hate, it just doesn't make sense to me, and what I want to do is impossible for me to turn into a job.

70,"I've been interested in psychology since I was in high school, and since becoming an elementary teacher I've learned a lot about brain and emotional development. I've struggled with my own childhood and past relationship experiences, and saw several counselors over the years but none really made a difference. 

One of the most frustrating things is that I feel like I logically understand why I do, think and feel the way I do but can't change my emotional response. That when triggered my brain mistakes non-threatening situations as threatening ones. I know that triggers send off the same alarm bells in my brain as the original traumatic experiences did, so my brain responds the same as if there were a real threat. For example, when a friend is going through a stressful life change (that has nothing to do with me) and wants some space to deal with it, my brain relates that to my mom emotionally abandoning me as an 8 year old, and I start thinking irrationally and panicking that my friend is abandoning me. I know the reality of the situation is that my friend just needs space, it has nothing to do with me, and is completely normal in healthy friendships. I logically know there is no threat of abandonment, but my emotional response is so strong that I constantly overthink and want to seek validation. This is just an example. 

I know I need to change my thinking patterns, but that's where I get stuck. Counselors have only seemed to talk about why my thought patterns are the way they are, which I already know, and talk about strategies like exercising or using grounding techniques when I'm in a hot moment. Those things may be helpful for calming down in the moment, but I just want to rewire my thinking patterns. I understand it all from a logical perspective, but my emotional side just doesn't seem to follow!

I cant focus. I will start a task, walk away 1/4 of the way through, start something else, get half way through that but get distracted and start another thing only to remember the first thing I was doing originally and get frustrated and so on.

I procrastinate so badly, even things I don't mind doing!

I feel like I must be lazy, when there are important tasks at hand I will get distracted with my phone or a show and sit for hours until I'm in trouble again. I'm 27 years old, why cant I get a grip!?

My head is loud, I can't harness a single thought at one time. Sometimes it feels like my brain consists of 5 TVs all with the volume on high. All demanding attention.

81,"I used to frequent this subreddit around 2-3 years ago, back then I felt lonely, hopeless, and unattractive. I felt like I wasn't worth any woman's time and effort, and that I was going to die lonely. I had major self esteem problems back then which fuelled those thoughts, I also often felt angry and bitter over my situation and always blamed it on my parents for bringing me into this world.

Nowadays I'm a better person. I don't feel hopeless about life, I don't feel angry or bitter as I did before. And objectively speaking, I have more value as a person now than I did before. I take care of my appearance, I focus on my studies, and I keep myself occupied with hobbies and interests.

Except here's one problem... I recognize now, from an objective perspective that realistically I will likely never find a girlfriend, never have a wife, never have a family, and at the end: die alone. Why? Cause objectively speaking, no woman wants to date an introverted, clinically depressed guy who interests are photography, weight lifting, travelling (by car mainly) and playing video games. It doesn't help that said guys sense of humor involves shock value, dark humor, random humor, and corny humor. It doesn't help me much that Im not objectively attractive, have an emotionless sounding voice, and am not in a good spot financially. I also might have ASD, as evidenced by my lack of ability to learn social skills. 

Here's the thing: I felt the exact same about myself around 2-3 years ago, I had the same interests, the same sense of humor, and same physical traits. The difference is that back then I was unproductive about it, I would spam posts to all the ""dating"" type subreddits venting off my issues. I would beat myself up allot and say negative things about myself. And often I would get angry and bitter thoughts about life and society. 

Nowadays I recognize it for what it is, and I recognize that I am the type of static individual that nobody has any thoughts about. I recognize that nobody outside my family will ever feel emotionally attached to me. And I recognize it objectively. I'm still productive about life, I go to the gym 4 times a week, I go out and take photos of my cities scenery, I have a small group of friends that I hang out with every weekend, I keep up to date with my schoolwork, and I'm also learning entrepreneurship too. 

What's I find sad is that like most people, I want to fall in love, I want to meet a woman who will love me for who I am, I want to start a family. And ultimately I want to share my life and my value with someone I love, but I can't. Im just simply unable to make a good first impression on any woman, and more importantly I'm unable to create any sort of emotional attachment. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is: there's a difference between thinking badly of yourself from a ""low self esteem"" lens and thinking badly of yourself from an ""objective"" lens. I used to feel so hopeless and down on myself because of my low self esteem, but now that I'm 19 and have been living with depression for around 4 years now, I came to the realization that I just need to accept my situation for what it is, make the most out of it, and not stress constantly. Maybe I'll get a dog when I move out to keep me less lonely? Maybe I'll start earning allot of money and women will be more inclined to get to know me? Maybe I'll die an accidental death and not ever have to worry about finding love any more? Who knows...",17Dec2019,1

Also I feel like when I’m UP I have creative superpowers that others seem to envy at times.

Atleast these guys have a distinct personality one at a time. I don’t have one. I don’t have one fully formed personality. I’m not making decisions based on what I want, cause I don’t know me. But I do know one thing. I’m not alone. You relate to this too don’t you? 

You developed a taste for rock music cause it was the cooler genre in your generation. You lied about where you were because you did not want anyone to know about the pastry you ate all by yourself. You’ve bought clothes that looked good on others, knowing you have a different body type. You’ve pulled your skirt up cause how else will you be noticed? You’ve pretended to bump into someone even though you planned the timing. You’ve faked a disaster in your life to get the attention you deserve. You’ve raised your voice to win arguments you knew you were losing. You’ve justified answers with “cause I know better” when you didn’t. You just wanted your way for once. You wanted to be socially accepted. You wanted to be respected for the decisions you made, so you made the wrong ones. You wanted to fight society for a cause that you didn’t really know much about. You wanted to be the guy who didn’t follow trends not because you didn’t like them, but because why give in? You’re insecure, but have self esteem. You’re hurt, but need to prove you’re strong. You want attention, but don’t want to look desperate. You want love, but don’t want to seem needy. You want compliments, but you’ll pretend to be shy. 

The only reason you’re self reflecting right now is because YOU haven’t been YOU. Get rid of the “buts”. There’s a solution here. Be upfront. Be straightforward. Speak your mind. Roll the dice and let your feelings out and see how it plays. Without putting yourself out there, how are you meant to find you? 

Call them greedy. Tell them they’re beautiful. Get them help. Tell them they’re rude. Tell them you refuse to be bullied. Tell your bestfriends they are self-centered. Tell them it’s your turn to get attention. Tell your parents you’ve made your choices. Voice your opinions even if no one agrees with you. Atleast that way you’ll have one. You’ll educate yourself. You’ll make choices you’re excited about. You’ll never feel the need to lie and you’ll feel so empowered. So content and so ready to discover more about yourself. Educate yourself about you. Love yourself for you. Celebrate yourself for you. Watch the world deny you, then envy you, then accept you and finally be one with you. 

To/about the author: You’ve given great advice, but you live in fear of never following it. You’re loved by all because you’ve been diplomatic. You hate small talk but you’re damn good at it. You’ve found a solution to everything you dislike, meanwhile you’ve forgotten to live the life you like. You’ve forgotten what you like, because you can’t discriminate anymore. You can control most things your friends can’t, so you pretend to feel mature. Your emotions, your fears, your drunk self, your image in public, your relationship with people, your first and last impression, your need to eat more, the urge to kiss another man. BUT You cannot control slipping away from who you are. You lost control when you stopped being selfish. You know you’ve lost control when you’re questioning you’re life at a time when everything seems to have fallen in place. You need help. You’ve misplaced your identity. 

Dissociative identity disorder, previously called multiple personality disorder, is usually a reaction to trauma as a way to help a person avoid bad memories.

*Misplaced identity disorder is usually a reaction to trauma as a way to help a person burry his or her true identity from the world. As a result of which most decisions made are in an unconscious state of self un-awareness.

LOL. Saw what I did there? I first diagnosed myself with a problem and then created a mental disorder to prove that my problem is real. JUST TO AVOID DEALING. Gahhhh.

I don't go whole weeks anymore since it's mentally to hard but to keep my grades up i have to at least attend some days ukno. But I can't. I can't even get myself out of bed! Going to school takes so much strength and besides that, school physically drains me. 

It's all far too hard and my mom keeps screaming at me when I'm not going which is definitely not helping me fix my shit. I get that she wants me to have a full education and all that but i also don't want the constant thoughts that I'm a failure and that i should kill myself ukno.

I have an appointment with a therapist on 1/20/20 to try and get things addressed.  However, i need some advice on dealing  with something new.  

Recently I have these moments where i suddenly start to sweat profusely, my heart races a bit, and my mind starts running 1000 mph.  It typically lasts for 2-3 minutes and then i catch myself and try to relax. This usually comes when i am not actively engaged in a task be it at work or at home.

I'm a college student and I've run out of money and I stopped going to classes a couple months ago and I skipped my finals for no reason so I failed most of them. I feel like I'm destroying my whole life, I wasted my money on stuff I don't need and I don't know why. When I had class I wouldn't go and I don't know why. I would wait until the day before a test and then study for 10 hours straight and that kept me doing okay for a while but now I skipped two of my finals so I know I will fail those classes but for some reason I don't even care even though I know I should. I don't want to fail because I've worked so hard to get here but for some reason I can't make myself care. I feel like I can't think or concentrate on anything. I thought about dropping out or at least taking a break but that won't make me happy, I will hate myself forever if I don't finish school. I don't know how to fix this and if I start next semester without something changing I know it will be the same and I will probably get kicked out of school by having two bad semesters in a row.

I know I'm doing all of this to myself and that's why I feel like I can't talk about this to my family or anyone I'm close to. They expect me to succeed and I feel like a failure even though I know I could succeed if I cared about myself or anything. I'm scared to talk to a therapist about any of this in person and it's expensive. I don't know if it will even change anything, and I don't know that I can afford to waste more money at this point. And if I'm given antidepressants or something I don't know if I can afford that either. I'm already in debt now. What should I do? Should I just take a break from school and get a full time job?

105,"Hello there,

I was curious about your tips on how to budget while having issues with your mental health. I don't have a diagnosis, but all I know is I have a manic phase where I have all the energy in the world and then I just buy a lot of ''stuff'' because I want to do new activities, subscribe to this new thing, buys new decoration for the house because I want to do X and Y project, it's stronger than me and seems to make sense at this point, so it's hard for me to notice until I come back down on earth or even worse I then get a down, where I barely have the energy to cook so I eat a lot of restaurant or things that are already prepared and take taxis because the walk to the bus seems like such a huge challenge when I'm that down... I am lucky enough to make a decent salary but I still end up with my account near 0 or so because either of those two states I'm constantly in are both so toxic for my budget.  


I had addiction problems in the past that I overcame, I was blaming my money problem on them but I then figured out it was only part of the problem, most of my money that is wasted really goes on one of these two states described...

108,"Not even sure if this is OK to post here, but here we go!

I have found that I would love to write a book on the struggles of growing up undiagnosed with several mental disorders, as well as making through struggles as an adult chronicling insights and experiences I've had. I want to do so to help educate others on a young person's struggle in hopes that some parents may recognize signs easier and that, if teens read it, they may understand some of their feelings and go to their doctors about them. 

I went undiagnosed with severe anxiety and depression as a teenager, and undiagnosed with ADHD for what could be my whole life. I was a terrible student always getting in trouble for drawing in class and not doing homework, but I later found I had a complete lack of motivation instead of not paying attention. When I applied myself I was a B student or above. But at 14, I suffered my first panic attack and began having them daily. My father, who suffers from the same illnesses that I do and maybe more, was in denial at first. I was upset that he wasn't letting me get medication for any of it but understood that he didn't want me to go through hell with it like he had (he had a very major struggle finding the right ones). Still, my dear old dad would stay up with me at night to comfort me during my panic attacks when I felt I needed him.

At 15, I was diagnosed with depression and GAD, and began medication for it. At 18, I was missing 2 years worth of credits in school, and was told by my step mother that she didn't believe I could get a diploma. I ended up leaving public school in favor of online school, but found the lack of motivation still a bad issue, and began a second medication which helped me make up everything with an extra year. I got my diploma out of sheer spite, but I was proud of myself.

I moved out due to unhealthy living conditions and lost health insurance at 19. I went unmedicated for a year until I gained it back, but was suddenly very ill on those same meds, so my doctor looked into things further. At 21, I was diagnosed with Bipolar II, and began the slow, uneasy, and uncomfortable process of starting a new medication meant for bipolar. 

At 22, I was diagnosed with severe ADHD and ADD, which caused severe fatigue and lack of motivation (what a shocker!) And began medicating it. At 23, I am independent with my own place, working hard to make sure I am OK. And what I want to do is write a book that may help others see the signs I did and get the help they need. I also desperately wish to help spread information on these struggles to help people understand that it's no joke and can be quite debilitating, that it NEEDS to be taken seriously and not be dismissed as ""excuses"". I don't want kids to experience what I went through, the fact that my academic scores suffered so greatly all my life despite me actually enjoying learning. I want to stress how important it is to try and find a doctor that cares about you, to learn to recognize behaviors that let you know when you need to focus on your mental health carefully, etc. I'm even considering taking classes in psychology to add more informed stuff on the matter so I don't accidentally spread misinformation. 

Would this be a good idea? I'm going mostly off my own experiences, my own struggles, as well as what I've witnessed with so many close friends and how I've done my best to support them. I'm real tired of people not taking me seriously when I tell them I'm sick due to a panic attack or I've gotten too stressed and it's made me ill. I'm sure a lot of people are too, and I want to help make a difference.",17Dec2019,1

125,"I’m a 23 year old black British girl with very coarse afro kinky hair (4c). I suffer from anxiety and around October I noticed I lost a lot of hair in the middle of my head, my doctor told me it was because of stress. I wear wigs so I cane row my hair and put a wig on, my  mum managed to braid over the bald patch fine. I hadn’t taken my cane rows out until today, for me the bald patch was an out of site out of mind thing so I was particularly anxious to take my hair out.
(Please note, yes I didn’t wash my hair for a few months but educate yourself on black hair before you attack me). 

I’ve just finished washing my hair and this was the first time I’ve had my hair out since October and I finally saw the bald patch again. It seriously took me by surprise how big it is, when I first noticed it, it was not as bad or maybe I was in denial. The hair is growing back slowly but it is so short that I can’t even get a grip on it. When I tie my hair up you can see the clear difference on both sides of my head, it’s flat, lacks thickness.

I know there are ways to make my hair grow back faster (my hair is natural and has been for 5 years). So I know a lot of tips and tricks but when I saw my hair I honestly broke down. I’m not usually attached to my hair like this but the state of it makes me so sad, it just looks weird so I think I want to shave it all off and start again.

133,"So, a bit of context:

I (25f) have been single for quite a while, to the point where every little gesture of attention (even just in a platonic friendship level) from an attractive guy is enough to make my attention starved mind really happy. I realize that, just by feeling this lonely, every little positive action will most definitely lead me to exaggerate (and blow out of proportion - aka overthinking) the meaning of any words or gestures directed towards me.

Anyway, as a way of trying to feel more normal/less lonely (and work on getting a boyfriend eventually), part of my happiness came from trying (and succeeding) in talking to guys in a friendly, non sexual, context. I mean engaging in trivial, friendly conversations - small talk, general advice, meme sharing (I can be a really quiet in person, so I found meme sharing to be a good way to help me express the mess floating around in my head) etc etc. This way I thought I would get better at understanding when a guy is interested, and how to go about it. 

The 80% of the guys I talk to are in the same college as me, and of those, almost all of them are my ""juniors"" (if that's the word). I like being the ""cool older senior that gives a helping hand"" for guys AND girls going through the same hardships I went through while taking my degree, because it gives me a sense of usefulness. Of course I enjoy it more if a guy comes to me for help, but I try my best to not be biased and give equal help no matter who it's for.

Recently I have been more open, more comfortable with being around people, with being around guys without overthinking. Sometimes playful touching or friendly hugs happen naturally (with guys and girls) and I don't feel so awkward anymore - I'm thinking ""I'm starting to get the hang of this whole socializing thing""

A few days ago things started to be less black and white with this whole social experiment.
---------

So I have this guy, a junior, and last year was the first time I actually noticed him because we had a common course. This guy is two years younger so it makes sense that under normal circumstances I wouldn't even meet him. It made even more sense not to think of him in a sexual way because he had a girlfriend at the time. So, you know, I was friendly with the guy, with occasional class related convos (I knew the majority of the people taking the class), but not ""that"" type of friendly (interfering in anyway in a relationship is out of the question - If he has a girlfriend, he's off limits. Period)

Fast forward to the present, and we sometimes hang out at lunch time because our friend circles are very similar. Now this guy, he's very sweet and proper, makes nice small talk and on occasion (and more recently) has made ""body contact"" (touch in the arm, hugs more rarely), and I thought nothing of it because he was doing the same to his female friends. So at this point, yeah I talk to the guy, but maintain distance out of respect to his girlfriend.

One day, I was sending ""motivational memes"" to my list of friends going through finals, and I decided to include him - that day I was feeling happy (and I did see him that day) and I though ""Why the heck not? It's just a few memes to laugh at - everybody likes them"". He starts chatting, I respond with snarky remarks and then he starts to dish out several hard to miss innuendos - which I promptly dismissed as sarcasm. Eventually he drops the bomb - he doesn't have a girlfriend anymore, and even apologizes if anything of what he said made me uncomfortable.

This is where I get a little panicked - I am in no way offended by the innuendos (and I tell him that), but I also don't know how to proceed (I also tell him that - that what we are talking about feels weird). He agrees, apologizes for making me feel uncomfortable. But at this point, I'm so happy. Happy for the attention, happy for the positive reactions - and more to the point, getting a little aroused by this unexpected interest. So, trying to keep in mind that he did get out of a relationship so recently, I give him honest compliments about him/his personality (maybe I was too enthusiastic?), but also let him know that it's perfectly normal and understandable to want to be alone at a time like this. He agrees, thanks me, and goes offline.

It's at this point where my loneliness starts to show its ugly head through the murk. I can manage to let a day go by whitout bothering him, but by the end of the second, my willpower gives out and I again send him some memes/motivational talk (this time with second intentions for sure). He could have dismissed the whole thing, but again we started approaching a possible mutual attraction (today, I feel like a total piece of shit, back then, I was getting ""high"" on the good feelings). I apologize for being so straightforward, he accepts and asks if I enjoyed what he said. I said yes, I really did, but again tell him that he should be taking some time for himself.

That must have flipped a switch in him, because by the time I realized, I'm sexting (in a very vanilla style tbh) with the guy and enjoying it to the fullest. I had absolutely NO idea the guy payed that much attention to me, which in turn, flipped my switch and made me extra horny. Long story short, the guy asks me to help him cum, and I happily/hungryly oblige. Afterwards, he compliments me some more and asks that this whole conversation is kept private (I of course agree wholeheartedly). 

We saw each other a few days later and managed to keep our poker faces. However. I couldn't stop thinking about him, about his lust, about how I want to feel him close to me irl. But at this point, several ideas get in my head: I should be giving him space; maybe it wasn't such a big deal for him; maybe he has other girls whom he's more romantically invested in (you know, because we still don't know eachother that well). 

He is still the same nice guy to me, and I have noticed a stare or two in my direction. However #2: I also noticed some over touching action between a girl friend of his year (she is also single). At this point, I feel like I'd be imposing myself just by wanting to talk to him alone; even just to say that I would enjoy his company, but totally understand it if he already has someone in mind and the whole sexting episode was just him being extra horny and frustrated.

Am I overthinking again? Was I a selfish piece of shit? I feel way over my head.

(Thank you for plowing through the mountain of text - I really needed to get this out of my chest)

I've had some terrible jobs in my past. I mean, they paid for my house so it can't be all bad, but some of them were traumatic. I'm not exaggerating. It doesn't help that I pressured into my current field by overbearing parents - it was never what I wanted to do with my life.

With the help of my spouse, I finally got the nerve to quit Sept 2017 and pursue my passions. I've been wildly successful in these endeavors and I've been truly happy - not just not-sad - HAPPY! I could sit back and feel like this was *my skin,* this is the life I was *supposed to live*.

Cue overbearing parents again! They live in the next town, so I see them often. Don't get me wrong, I love them, but they *are* overbearing. In fact, me loving them is what caused me to help out their company - doing the exact same stuff I was doing before.... I was promised it was only going to be a three month contract, but it's turning into something longer.

So now I don't have time to continue my other life. I'm either at work or my spouse is home and I can't do anything I want to do.

So! Now I'm anxious and depressed and resenting my spouse. It feels like I'm juggling three chainsaws \[work, spouse, passions\] and I have to drop one.

Dropping work seems completely unfeasible.

Dropping passions makes me very seriously contemplate suicide. Why wake up everyday when everyday is so joyless?

Dropping spouse seems like the only option besides suicide.

My dad was at a loss at what to do because he's always told her to just stop stealing (apparently this has been happening since before they were dating).

149,"Hello! This is my (24F) first post and I'm really bad at organising my thoughts and I tend to go off on rangers a lot so I hope this actually makes sense! Sorry it's so long 😁)

Tldr: I initially thought I had OCD but I think I may actually have BPD or even ASD 

Basically, its be nice to know if anyone can relate to stuff like this or if anyone has any advice on what i could do. I plan on talking to my doctor but they're pretty useless tbf (there's probably a lot missing but I already wrote so much....)

Bit of background:
I've always known some people throughout school/random kids from my area thought I was a bit weird or 'beady' as they put it (c*nts) but I have never been able to figure out why, or why I used to find it so hard to fit in and be like everyone else. I was somewhat bullied throughout school and have been the butt of the joke a fair few times in my friend groups.
When I was about 18 I started to realise that some thoughts that I had weren't normal. Obsessive thoughts and worries would plague me (some were very bad) and I began to think I might have (pure O) OCD. I noticed a lot of my compulsions were mental and had been around since I was about 7 or 8. I started ""playing games"" in my head with road markings, street lights, etc. I couldn't step on the lines, and would blink when i felt i was an equal distance between two things (between the lines street lights etc). I still do this now. I also have a habit of collecting pretty much anything with a memory attached to it or even a little bit of importance even if it's rubbish (I tried to keep the paper cup from my first bubble tea...). I have tried to work around this by scrapbooking/creating mood boards to minimise the crap I collect lmao (I sometimes literally can't differentiate between something that is actually necessary and something I just don't want to part with). I talked to my GP and instead of having a mental health assessment or whatever I basically got shipped straight to CBT (the mental health professional kept rescheduling my apt and didn't really seem to care), so I never knew if I had OCD or not. Now, I am questioning whether I have OCD or whether I'm actually presenting symptoms of asd/autism. Most recently I've been diagnosed with depression and  I just can't help but feel that there's more to it.

(I realise how much I'm writing so I'm going to try and just bullet point)

*I have a hard time connecting with people and staying in touch with people I'm around even if I hold them dear to me. I want to keep these friends but I can't. 
*When I become friends with someone I think I start to idolise them, i get jealous or feel threatened when someone else comes along and  i want their attention to be towards me.
*Same with romantic interests, I've noticed if someone shows affection towards me (with romantic intent or not) I either feel disgusted and fearful or start thinking they like me and basically go off on a mental tangent revolving my thoughts around them. 
*Sometimes i feel horribly manipulative with my actions and the way and talk to them and I know how wrong it feels. But there are times when I just don't care. 
*I feel like sometimes people talk or laugh about me behind my back (even if it's just banter, we all do it, but I feel overly sensitive about it when it's aimed at me). I don't want to think like this, i hate it. sometimes, for the prettiest of reasons I'll feel mad or angry at them. 
*I feel like I have a lot of anger and aggression mentally, but I try my hardest to never let it out. (This is one of the reasons i think it could be BPD)

I've noticed with all of my close friendships I've had a love-hate relationship, and it's been because of me.
*I don't know what's going 'too far' and there are times when i don't understand why people get so affected by something i wouldnt be affected by (even though i fully understand they think and feel differently to me). I want to be able to love and be there for my friends but mentally something just isn't right. 
*I feel I don't have the emotional capacity to care about others, even though I want to. I have never really felt sympathy, I can feel empathy to the extent of being able to ""put myself in someone else's shoes"" but as far as caring or being able to sympathise with them, I can't really do it. 
*When I was younger I started picking up on what other kids were going and tried to mimic them in certain aspects (speech manner, vocab, behaviour/mannerisms, facial expressions, handwriting etc). I can't even count how many times I've done this, but as I grew up I spent less time around people my age and more time around my family/adults and also started mimicking them. I usually do it consciously but I have noticed sometimes I'll hear something or someone passing by me saying something in the street and I unconsciously repeat it (usually when I'm with company) or will hear it over and over again in my mind (if I'm alone). 

*I have a LOT of trouble organising my thoughts, or just generally organising things in a comprehensive manner 
*I couldn't really look people in the eye until I was about 15(?) When I forced myself to start doing it. I then noticed I couldn't recognise people when I looked at their eyes as they felt like different people (even family). I recognised people by general appearance or anything that differentiated them.
*I have hypersensitivity to certain textures/sounds (which I'm pretty sure is normal to an extent) but I can't touch certain textures (even my own fingerprints) otherwise I have to rub soft/smooth surfaces until I feel calm
*I don't like physical contact with people unless I'm VERY comfortable/at ease around them (I also find it very hard to open up to people and avoid talking about intimate topics as much as I can)
*I don't like busy places, or social situations unless I'm prepared

(Ah man, I can't even think anymore and I've written so much. It feels nice just to write this and get it off my chest. )

Anyways, i feel like I'm weighing too much on this, its been on my mind for a long time but I've always brushed it off as me over worrying. Either way, it would be nice to hear a new perspective on my behaviour and hear some people's opinions on what could be up with me!",17Dec2019,1

Happiness - I can laugh genuinely and crack a smile if something makes me happy

Sadness - I always look sad but when I am really sad my body language reflects that heavily

Anger - It's not worth getting angry, just be angry on the inside and move on

Fear - Missed a college deadline? not finished the work? oh well no point worrying about it I'll just feel anxious all day and possibly the next, that's what propranalol is there for :)

Disgust - Fuck that's disgusting... oh well it's not my problem or if it is then oh well time to clean up or whatever

154," My life is not (that) fucked up, yet I still wonder what's the point of all. I left a job where I pretty much barely had to do anything for more interesting career opportunities, and after going through a couple jobs I realized that I hate working. Unfortunately I either have to work or starve. Even while working my ass off, I can't afford to buy a house or a decent car. I'm pretty much slaving away to put food on the table and put some money away for savings. We would have to save for 10 years just to afford a down payment, if our rent stays the same (which it won't)

I have a wife and a kid. I find no joy in either of them. My kid is 1 year old, and the only thing I feel towards it is annoyance when I have to take care of it. No feelings of joy at all, and I'm always trying to squirm out of any fatherly duties. This obviously pisses my wife off. BTW, regarding my wife, the spark is not there at all now (maybe it never was) We pretty much just stuck together and things evolved. Somehow she forgot to dump me? Sex is not great, though I haven't had any for 1.5 years now. She's not interested in any of my fetishes and said to me a couple of times that she doesn't find me attractive anymore (I did gain about 20 pounds in the past 15 years...) I can't rely on her for emotional support (or anyone, but I've learned to deal with shit on my own), we can't talk about our issues (everything is my fault, and I just apologize and give up, instead of having another argument) I often feel emotionally neglected, there's barely any physical contact.

I don't have close friends. There's a couple of mates I talk to semi-regularly, but that's all. All my relationships are superficial. Also, I can't afford mental health (without being locked up), so I have to deal with my problems on my own. At least I'm not addicted to anything apart from cigarettes, though I considered drinking myself into oblivion every night. Realized I don't even like the taste of liquor, so I can't even be a proper drunkard.

I don't necessarily want to die, but I don't see the point of being a small cog in the machine, slaving away for 40-50 years and achieving nothing, apart from a dysfunctional family (pretty sure that my kid is going to be fucked up) Every day after some mind numbing work I'm pretending to like my kid, supporting a woman whom I don't feel anything toward, then browsing reddit or memes until I go to sleep. I don't game or work out anymore, I don't have any social life. I'm also ugly and have some health issues. When going to sleep I'm hoping that I won't wake up.

I could divorce, but it would just lead to having to pay child support and regretting the choice until the rest of my (what if I could've had a good relationship with my kid when it's older, etc) Also, I would be even more alone, as pretty much nobody would like to be a relationship with me (poor, ugly, geek, weird kinks) I see no way out :/",17Dec2019,1
155,"This is my first post and I’m typing it on my phone, so hopefully it’s not confusing! I’ve struggled with PTSD, depression, and anxiety since I was 10ish and am 26 now. In college, I made “friends” and was so happy to finally not be alone. But realized they weren’t true friends, and someone I considered close is now engaged to a man who sexually assaulted me multiple times and is supported by most of my friends.

Since my abuse, I’ve tried to hide feelings. I recently got my Masters in school counseling and had an amazing supervisor (F30) for 2 years. She opened up to me about her struggles, and we began to get close. I began to trust her and opened up. At the beginning, I downplayed it but then began to reveal my actual struggles. She would tell me how I wouldn’t be alone and would always have her. On my last day of internship, she told me that she would rather have me texting her all day than lying in bed and not talking to anyone.

At the beginning, she was reaching out to me to check in. I began to feel supported and actually was able to open up to my therapist about the extent of my trauma because of this support. She even wrote me a note that said to remember that I can always reach out and will always have a caring friend in her. I trusted her and she became like a big sister to me. She was struggling too at this time as her boyfriend of 4 years broke up with her. But she kept talking to me. I began to text her more, typically multiple times a week. She never said anything about it. She began to seem off when school began but said she was busy.

I began to really struggle around September due to my meds. During this time, I texted about suicidal thoughts. The first weekend in October, I reached out about this and asked if she would be willing to call my psychologist to let him know. She did, but then said that it was the limit of what she can do and she couldn’t support me how I need. Then she said she wasn’t leaving me but needed to take time to focus on her, and would reach out when she was ready.

My therapist was advising me on when to reach out and what to say to repair my friendship. I would wait a few weeks before texting about things like rebalancing our friendship. She never replied to any of these. Over Thanksgiving, I messed up and texted quite a bit. That Tuesday I texted that I had a gift for her (I made her a gift of 365 notes for her 30th birthday and she cried telling me no one had done anything like this before so wanted to do that again). Texted on Thanksgiving to wish her a happy Thanksgiving, as my therapist said to do. My next session was that Monday, and my therapist said to share how my suicidal thoughts are gone now that I changed meds. My friend lost a friend to suicide a few years ago and while she reassured me that she was ok talking about it, it may have gotten to be too much. So I reached out sharing that. I also reached out Monday evening saying it’s been 2 months and asking if she could react to a message so I knew she was alive and ok (have anxiety about people dying after losing 3 family members in less than 3 months). She replied and said she had told me she would contact when she was ready to reach out and I have not respected that. She said she wishes me the best but to please not reach out to her again. I panicked and said I wouldn’t and was trying to give her space, and I hoped she would give me a second chance. 2 days later, I texted explaining that I didn’t realize I shouldn’t text at all and wasn’t trying to disrespect her but I understood now. Then realized she blocked me.

I am so panicked. I was trying to repair the friendship but instead ruined it. My therapist said to now work on getting better to help repair the friendship eventually. Has anyone been able to repair a friendship they ruined due to being too clingy or dependent after recovering from depression?",17Dec2019,1

158,"This is a quite long story, spreading throughout years, almost even a decade compiled into this short text about my story. 

I had this classmate. She was a quiet girl, just like I was a quiet boy. So I've known her from a very long time ago. First time I knew her I was 8 I'm 18 now. First I did not seem interested, in her, because I thought who needs a girlfriend and they are disgusting (Pretty common 8-10 year old thinking). But as time passed, I started to appreciate her company. At the end of the 5th year, we're started walking together home from school. Always talking about video games movies and whatever. So as I tried to do more and more things, she became more and more open too. 

When I started High School we were going together with a bus, now I'm usually driving her to and from the school, go shooting together, go to a lot of movies. She still did not wanted to come into my house, because she is quite nervous, because of a past experience (not rape). 

Fast forward to last Sunday (December 7th). I get a call that I won a trip to Zagreb from a raffle at a Student working company, and that I can bring 1 people with me (The trip was last Sunday on the 15th of December). I was so excited for the trip, I decided that I will tell her how I feel, and that I might feel love for the first time ever. Throughout the day, I did not have the strength, so we were just strolling the streets, going into the boutiques, or libraries, as she's intellectual, and LOVES reading. 30 minutes before we leave, we sit to a bench at the Fabulas, and told her this:  
 *""You know I'm not good with words, but I just really wanted to tell you that you are important to me, and that I love you.""*  
Her reply was:  
*""Ok.""*

She left me on seen. I am shattered, heartbroken, and desperate. I finally worked myself to express how I feel, and she just shattered my hopes.

So I'm asking you this:

Who will love me, when even the ones I lived my childhood won't? When will a person finally experience real love?",17Dec2019,1
159,"I can't just make use of the fact I'm living. Instead I am thinking of how to get normal, what should I do, what to change. It is killing me. Professional help didn't help at all...

I wish I could enjoy live and not torture myself so much.",17Dec2019,1
160,"This is really long, I'm sorry.

So I'll start with: I'm 23M and have struggled with depression all my life. This last year, I've been more stressed about more things than ever, particularly things that I have no control over, like the fact that I'm going to die. I've started worrying about things more and more, like my health (every headache might be a brain tumor, etc.) I used to be very confident and didn't sweat the small stuff but over the last few years I've really lost a lot of my confidence and self-esteem. It's hard to get out of bed in the morning, most nights I can't sleep, and if I do sleep, I wake up exhausted no matter how much or how little I slept. A lot of the nights these days I have very vivid nightmares, after which I'll wake up with this intense fear and stay up all night. Like I'm terrified but of nothing. I also experience sleep paralysis, it's happening at least twice a week now. It's no longer frightening because of the frequency, when I wake up and can't move my body, I just get very irritated. 

Winter of last year I decided to experiment with mushrooms with my girlfriend. I had never done any kind of drugs before. I only include this story because I think it may have stirred up some weird issues I never knew I had. Anyway, mushroom trip 1 was the single greatest experience of my life. Mushroom trip 2 was fine until I did something stupid an dangerous to others (thankfully nothing happened), realized how stupid and dangerous it was and I could have hurt someone while in the deepest part of the trip, and spent the next four hours having a breakdown in my apartment waiting for the cops to kick my door in, watching cigarettes burn to keep track of time. Mushroom trip 3 (and this is the most relevant) was bad but for literally no reason. I was totally fine until one bad thought crept in my head (that I had accidentally hurt my girlfriend without knowing it) and I spiraled into what I assume was a series of panic attacks. My girlfriend who was sitting next to me, totally fine, holding my hand, also tripping, didn't notice. I made her stay on the couch the full rest of the trip while I got control of myself with breathing exercises, fighting off the irrational bad thoughts, and convincing myself that mushrooms don't work that way. Anyway, I came down from that, and decided never to touch psychedelics again since I obviously am not the kind of person who can handle detachment from reality and go with the flow. 

This is relevant because the exact feelings I experienced during that trip are back for no reason. The exact same physical sensations and thought patterns. Starting the other day, I was scrolling on reddit and all of a sudden I had this surge of fear, the exact headrush and downward spiral of horrible thoughts that I experienced during that trip. I pushed the thoughts out and brushed it off as something weird but for the rest of the day I felt like I was tripping out, needing to focus hard on not letting the bad thoughts in, and blocking them out when they would start to rush in. I felt very strange in my head, as if I was out of place or I was detached from my body. I went to my girlfriend's house (she's out of state right now) to get some things, and I took a shower and felt better, but as soon as I got home it all came back. I called my girlfriend, and she told my what I was describing is exactly what happens to her before she has a panic attack. So I went and told my parents and brother (not the mushroom bit) which was a mistake because as loving and helpful as they are, it turned into an hour of ""I know how you're feeling, sometimes I think bad thoughts"" and ""you should try figuring out what's stressing you out and then try not to stress about it!"" It's hard to explain to someone the difference between sometimes thinking bad thoughts but brushing them off and all of a sudden a floodgate of horrible, unrealistic thoughts opening and you start to panic because you think ""what if my whole family is dead? What if I'm hallucinating this reality?"" 

Anyway, my brother hung out with me all night, I put some headphones on with relaxing music, and tried to keep that floodgate from opening. My brother fell asleep, but every time I would doze off, I would jump awake as the rushing feeling started. Eventually I got mad because I really wanted to sleep and thought, ""just happen already, I want to sleep."" Anyway, I finally dozed off, and when I woke up it really hit me. I thought ""okay, this is it, just stay calm"" but what happened was lackluster and not what I was expecting. Basically, I let that headrush take me, reminding me that my brother was asleep right next to me, and to keep my breathing under control. My vision kind of blurred a bit, my heart started hammering out of my chest, and for what was maybe 3 minutes I was almost detached from my body as all this intense fight or flight response hit my body. I kept my breathing and thoughts under control, and when it passed I felt clammy and like I really had to poop, like after a heavy adrenaline dump. I slept for 2 hours until my brother and I had to work in the morning. The next day I felt much better although my stomach was a wonky. I didn't eat all day until dinner. I went to the gym and taught my classes, then I came home where all was good until about 1am, I'm on my laptop and the whole surge happens again. It wasn't as bad as the night before, I moved around the house and took melatonin and waited for it to knock me out while focusing on blocking out bad thoughts. This morning I woke up totally fine, but that only lasted until breakfast. I'm sitting here still having random surges of fear, but not nearly as bad as the other day. I'm about to head to the gym to teach my classes.

What the hell is wrong with me? 

Other info that might be relevant: I have been to a therapist in the past, just for depression. I didn't like her very much, I don't think she helped. She had me on welbutrin for a while which made me feel a bit better but when I moved out of state I tapered myself off it since it really didn't help *that* much, and it was killing my already low sex drive.",17Dec2019,1
161,"Hey there,
first of all I think my mental health is fine, this post will be about my mom.
I'm 20 years old and my mom suffers from i-dont-know what for a cuple of years now.
I guess its depression or BPD, but what do I know.
She lost her friends and family due to that. Shes become alcoholic. And has been unable to work for about 2 years now. My father now provides for us 3 kids of which I am by far the oldest.
I still live at home and attend to a university.
Today I had a pretty deep talk with my mom. She was very drunk and I think I kinda understand what her deeper problem is and why she shows absolutely zero interest in getting better.
She is close to 50 and doesnt believe her life will get better. She sees no future for herself, neither do I. She will never work again and nobody would employ her if she were able to work. Her friends lived 5 years without her in their lives, her husband despises her and so do I.
However, I cannot accept the current state of our family. My siblings are entering puberty and they will get incresingly awere of the psychological toture we all endure due to her alcoholism. I cant describe it well tbh. Her crying, shouting, swearing and calling me, my dad and more often my 12 year old brother names is pretty fucking depressing.
How could I possibly motivate her to CHANGE something about her life?
She had multiple alcohol caused bike accidents, almoast cut her ear off and got arrested once.
How can I help my siblings who will go through what I went through the past 5 years?
How can I manage to accept the fact that my farher works literally all day, trying to provide, and also lost so many of his friends?
He has no time for a hobby and has less than 2 hours of free time per week while my mother sits in front of the TV with alcohol she buy via stealing any money that lies around?

166,"Alright, I’ll try to be brief. Please bear with me 

A little background:

I developed bulimia at age 11. That was nine years ago. It got really bad in high school (I lost my period, had heart problems, was constantly getting ill and crazy depressed). I recovered with the help of my high school boyfriend, although I would still indulge in my eating disorder from time to time behind his back. We broke up and I started dating my current boyfriend. He’s amazing and I love him so much. I haven’t had a relapse since before we started dating, about two and a half years ago. Also, side note, every time I get drunk I get very depressed and, depending on how intoxicated I am, suicidal.

This is the current situation:

A few weeks ago I went out with some friends from school and the restaurant had the calorie-counts listed on the menu. Usually this doesn’t affect me very much, but for some reason, I started getting really overwhelmed and anxious. I ordered something very expensive that I didn’t even want because it had the fewest calories on the menu. Halfway through the meal, I excused myself and purged in the bathroom. Since then, I’ve been feeling just like I did when I was in the thick of my Bulimia. However, it feels almost voluntary. Like, I could definitely stop if I wanted to. It has hardly even started yet. But I’ve been intentionally trying to get myself spiraling. I’ve been visiting pro-eating disorder forums that I used to use, reading my old diary entries, and just trying to amp myself up in all of those self-loathing thoughts. What’s wrong with me? I really feel like I’m trying to go down into that dark place again and I don’t know why. I took a ton of laxatives yesterday and have made plans to flush-purge while my boyfriend is at work tonight. 

Thanks in advance for any advice or insight. I feel so dumb 

TL;DR used to have an ED, I’m recovered. Suddenly I’ve been trying to get myself to a self-destructive point again and I have no idea why",17Dec2019,1

In  August 2018, I was eating with my family. My father almost died due to choking on a piece of food. I spoke with my therapist about this, he thinks that this encounter with death has led to the fear of death in myself. It makes sense.   


I'm a healthy 22-year-old guy, but I am on meds (Rexulti, Wellbutrin and Pristiq). How do I overcome this fear of death?   


Beyond that, I've been dealing with feelings of sadness and loneliness. Ever since my relationship ended, it seems things have gotten worse.....  


It doesn't feel like my meds are working at all. Anyone have any advice?",17Dec2019,1
168,"Please give me advice, if you can. I just want relief. I am not good at voicing my thoughts into words, so please excuse it if it doesn't make sense. 

I am a 16-year old girl who suffers from anxiety and paranoia-related issues. I can't take it anymore. It's getting so much worse... so much more painful with every passing day.

 I struggle to trust any of my loved ones. My brain can't comprehend the fact that they love and care for me - it always jumps to the idea that they hate me and will abandon me. I recently got into a relationship with a girl who is just utterly amazing in every single way possible yet I can't trust her. I believe she's a cheating liar who is going to dump me and break my heart. Though, I KNOW she isn't. She tells me every single day that she'd never betray me when I ask her for reassurance yet I CAN'T trust her. I am so pathetic to the point of where I have to write down when she (and my family) say sentimental things or I will just rampage on how they're out to get me/playing me/or liars. I can't trust my parents. I love them so, so, so much. I know they return the love as well. Yet my brain completely discards any time they display their love for me and makes me believe that I am despised &amp; alone. It's almost like I gain some kind of temporary amnesia and just fret incessantly about how I'm hated by everyone when I'm NOT. I hope that makes sense. 

I can't enjoy anything anymore. I always think of negative things. Like, if I am spending time with family, I will think about how they will all die someday. I can't focus on the moment. I can't sit back and find pleasure in things. I always think about how my girlfriend is going to find someone better than me, how my parents are going to eventually get sick &amp; die, or how I will have to move out someday and suffer on my own. I can't consider the idea that maybe she won't dump me, or maybe my parents will grow old. I see everything with negative lenses on. I go through an effing existential crisis every single day. I am a hypochondriac and will have a panic attack at the slightest ache. The list is endless. 

I tell myself that this spell will be over. But, I know it won't ever be over. I will always have this paranoia embedded into my brain. I will always stress about my health or about that of my parents. I will always hesitate before going out with friends. I will never be able to have a trusting relationship. Sometimes it makes me consider suicide because I know I will always be in pain. My friends see me as a pessimist when all I desire is HELP. I'm afraid to talk to them because I know they will eventually get tired of my begging and leave me. I just love my friends and loved ones so very much and I wish I could portray this love like a normal, functioning human being. I'm tired of crying each and every day. I just want the pain to go away so I can be happy for once. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want to harass my parents for therapy because they already have enough bills on their plate. I don't want to talk to anyone because I don't want to stress them out or make them unhappy. I am so afraid &amp; anxious and the pain is becoming unbearable. I don't know if I should break it off with my girlfriend. She is literally one in a million and has shown me a surplus of support.... but I can't stop being paranoid. It never stops, no matter what she says to me. I don't want to break up with her, though, because I just... I don't know, I guess I just love her a lot. Don't flame me for saying that at such a young age, but she is genuinely an angel and I dunno what I'd do without her. Sometimes I consider breaking it off just so I can get the pain over with... I feel stupid and overdramatic but it's the godhonest truth. I would hate to lose her but I'm tired of letting my problems make her unhappy. 

Thank you for reading. If you can, please offer me some advice. Tell me moving stories of recovery. Even just say a greeting and tell me about your day. I don't care, it offers me distraction. These suicidal thoughts scare me so much, because I truly love my life but I just can't stop worrying. Again, thank you. &lt;3",17Dec2019,1

172,"For starters I would like to say I don’t post here much but thanks to you all I have had a serious breakthrough on managing my BPD, anxiety, and depression. I am currently without healthcare but by reading all of your posts filled with great advice and coping mechanisms, it has immensely helped me feel less alone and more proactive about my putting my mental health first. 

I am now in the first serious relationship I’ve been in where I disclosed to my SO I have BPD, and also the first where I even knew I had it. This has been good for me because with my knowledge of splitting and triggers leading up to splitting, I have much more of a grip on handling hardships than I did in previous relationships. 

So, things have been alright. I work full time as a receptionist while attending college full time after my 40 hour work week. It is a lot on my plate, but I have been managing time decently. Or so I thought. 

I’m usually with my SO 24/7 but since I was trying to be the “laid back cool gf” version of myself - I let him have the weekend to himself to watch football and have quality guy time, while I went to stay at my buddies place. (He is a gay male with unfortunate drug addiction issues and one of my very best friends.) 

I thought I would use this time away from my boyfriend to study at my friends house. He gave me an adderall to focus on my studies, and I thought this was a good idea. What ended up happening was the anxiety of taking a methamphetamine forced me to consume various Benzos just to feel level. I am not proud of this. I was still so anxious that even though I was wired from just a sliver of this adderall that I could not bring myself to even open up my laptop and do any work. I was so filled with dread and anxiety and still am. I missed deadlines for finals even though up until this week I had maintained straight A’s. Instead of doing my hw, I had some sort of manic episode and emailed a former friend (who I pushed away with my BPD episodes) - and completely over shared and humiliated myself. I also spent all night masturbating and engaging in all around really weird behavior once I was left alone. 

To make matters worse, because I was so anxious and couldn’t sleep, when I finally drifted off - I could not hear my alarm clock in the morning and woke up three hours late to work. This made me suffer an extremely debilitating panic attack. I sent wall texts to every manager in my department and went to the ER to get a doctors note out of desperation not to be fired. I am so humiliated this has happened to me. 

As I said above I don’t have healthcare so I was unable to obtain any kind of anxiety medication. I also don’t want to be dependent on xanax again, but they seem to be the only medicine that works for me when I’m in this state. The doctor wrote me a note saying I had a GI bug and could be back to work tomorrow. I begged him to give me one more day off as I knew my gastrointestinal issues were anxiety induced and would not wear off by tomorrow. They implied if I made the visit about my mental health they would have to admit me and cannot take me out of work for just having anxiety attacks. 

I am now at my boyfriends waiting for him to get home and feel extremely numb. I cannot bring myself to open up my laptop even though I have past due assignments that need to be completed immediately. I can tell I am dissociating and no longer feel the desire to work or attend school or put effort into life at all. I feel like a zombie. 

At the end of the day I know drugs, stimulants especially, are not helping my BPD. I am really depressed now and don’t want to do anything. I feel like a complete failure. I have no motivation. I can’t go back to work tomorrow. 

TLDR; I self sabotaged by taking drugs to help me survive finals week which ended up destroying my finals week and could possibly have lost me my job and the stable mental health I had been sustaining up until now.

174,"Hi there!
So first a bit of a background on me, I am 16, living in the UK and I was diagnosed with PTSD at ~9 but never received treatment for it.

So basically, I left school at 9 (after being bullied by kids/teachers) and started being homeschooled. I was relatively alone for the next year and was happy with that, then I met a (kinda) friend who I have been friends with up until a couple of weeks ago. He wasn’t particularly nice, just someone to talk to. But for a long time I didn’t want any friends, just to be alone, until last year when the loneliness started getting to me so I started trying to make other friends. 
This is when (I think) the PTSD n stuff has started to become a problem. 

Anyways, basically the things I’ve been noticing is I’m having trouble coping with extreme emotions (like falling in love), not being able to cry or express some emotions, not being able to relax, not being able to connect with people (or at least it feels like it), feeling like every hates me and only talks to me because theyre polite, having trouble concentrating, having trouble letting go of the memories from being bullied at school, having trouble sleeping/getting to sleep etc etc.

I think I need help, idk. I would like some advice on this. 

I tried to reach out and get help in January, through a family member telling my dad, but i just got scared and it all felt wrong and I just tried to bury it (and did). And this year has been the most depressed I’ve ever been, with me struggling through barely (I’m in a relatively better place now tho.)

I don’t particularly wanna involve the parents to start with, because I don’t want to bottle out this time. The relationship with the girl I like I can’t see being sustainable because of my inability to show the emotions she deserves from me when I’m just too overwhelmed with everything. I kinda cold shoulder her and It’s not because I don’t like her but because I can’t cope with any of it. And I don’t wanna let her down, cause I didn’t ever expect this problem.

So basically, reading that what can you ppl tell me? Is there any online tests or something? Can I go to the GP on my own and talk about it? Can I get free Counselling on the NHS (I have no money)? Is there even a NHS online like video chat counselling thing?

Just anything, advice, comments, whatever, is welcome.

Thank you for listening.",17Dec2019,1
175,"I want to start by saying I know it's not healthy to completely blame your shortcomings on others. I know that a lot of these issues have to do with my own lack of motivation. 

That being said, I'm struggling a lot to find my true passion. Everything I've gotten good at I eventually gave up because it wasn't getting me anywhere. I played drums for 11 years, and it was probably the skill I developed the most. Gave that up due to depression from my sisters kicking me out of our band.

I got decent at drawing and then stopped practicing regularly when a project I had spent a lot of time preparing for got scrapped. 

I have a portfolio and stuff, and I'm slowly trying to get back into these hobbies, but I don't feel like there's anything from them that I could or should make into a career. I have some friends that have found an audience, and one of them told me I just needed to make stuff when I was a bit frustrated they never asked me for help with things, and that response made me so incredibly mad because I have an entire portfolio, yet the only things I've been able to help them with is cleaning up after pets and being considered (not even hired) to clean their office. 

I know my friends don't owe me anything. I know it's probably selfish of me to be irritated that I don't get asked to help them with projects. But I picked up my whole life and moved to a different city with the hopes it would show them I'm serious about things, and they won't give me a chance. At a certain point, it does kind of make me feel worthless to them, despite the fact that logically I know my value to them as an artist is different than my value as a friend. **It's kinda hard to even approach this subject delicately without making it sound like I'm just around due to my hopes of riding their coattails.** 

I know that me feeling a lack of motivation doesn't help my case, but I really don't know what else to do at this point. I can't figure out what to do with my life or what I even enjoy as a hobby because I put so much pressure on myself to have that skill noticed by others, and when it's not, that means I'm a talentless failure. The things I can remember being the most happy while I was doing them eventually got ruined by my need for recognition, and I wish I knew how to make that need go away.",17Dec2019,1
176,I have been having a very hard time processing and dealing with emotions. Certain thing have happened in the last month that has left me feeling more like an empty shell if myself. I always grew up believing that healing just takes time and that my emotions are just a natural cycle of grief. At what point should I start to seek help?,17Dec2019,1
