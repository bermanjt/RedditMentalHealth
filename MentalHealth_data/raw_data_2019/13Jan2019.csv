0,"I have had a history of depression in the past but am no longer depressed right now. And I know we can all casually joke and say ""oh maybe I should just end it all"" as sarcasm when something bad happens. But sometimes an extremely minor inconvenience will land on my lap, like my laptop not responding, or my phone taking a while to load, and I'll go from a perfectly healthy mindset to, unironically ""shit man, maybe I should just kill myself.""

I am known to have a dark and edgy sense of humour so the way in which I think these things sounds almost comical and jokey, but I mean them almost seriously. And it lasts for all of about ten seconds or so. Ten seconds of genuinely considering suicide and then I'm my normal self again; Not wanting to die.

I don't know how unhealthy this is? Given my history with it, I'd say this is the healthiest these thoughts have ever been... But it's still kinda messed up, right?

Just as a disclaimer, I am not currently suffering anything and am operating as a healthy person, so don't assume the worst about my health or that I'm making a fuss. It's the fact I'm fine that makes these brief moments of suicidal thought concerning to me.",13Jan2019,1
1,"I know this isnt a place for getting diagnosis I just want to be pushed toward the right direction of things as I am lost. I dont know if I am in denial to this stuff being issues though. When I would think of help, I just think this is probably normal stuff. From what I have looked at I dont think this stuff lines up with the diseases I have looked up. And I know if I would ask or go get help and this stuff be normal then I will be ridiculed by my family and the doctors. They will talk about it forever.

Background: So I am 22 year old man living at my parents home in the United States I take some classes online for Business Administration (as I didnt know what else to) In grade school I was always bullied. this took place from 4th grade until 12th grade. I have had some issues the whole time and still do today but I believe it's normal behavior depending on my mood. It has took me a few weeks to get this post how I want it

So here is just a couple things from my daily Journal I started a month ago when I finally started to question my ways

 1. Every person I see outside my parents and grandparents I feel like they are going to bully or belittle me. I just know it's what is running through there head. Everyone, no matter what does this to me. Some even act on it by approaching me or 

 2. I cant make eye contact or speak to people without feeling like I am going to jump out of my skin from panic/anxiety

 3. I have little to no short term memory. I'm not sure when this started even.

 4. I hurt internally when I hear loud noises like dropping something on floor (anything from salt shaker to a spoon), loud music, dogs barking, setting items down on glass tables, pretty much anything that is considered like those. I cant describe

 5. I pick at bumps on my face, arms, underarms, private area. When I do it it's like, for lack of a better word, a drug high. Time passes so fast and it feels so good. I do this whenever I'm in front of a mirror or in good lighting. This is usually after I freak out over something

 6. Anxiety over other people driving. Especially when they park. I end up cringing and saying some form of watch out

 7. I go through these weird periods about every other day of a feeling I dont know how to describe as emptiness. 

 8. I have turned down trips to places I know may have a bit of people. Similarly if I am going to a plaxd and I see people inside the windows near the door (like a gym) I run back to my truck and dont go.

 9. When driving everyone seems to want to try to hit me. Also while driving I find myself daydreaming of other cars crashing and how it would happen. 

 10. If I am with my family at a store I find myself going to the isles that isnt crowded. When they go to the register I usually go outside to the vehicle. I know the camera watcher is watching me making fun of how I am alone but I can be a little more okay with that then see them face to face. 

 11. I have a constant feeling I am going to get kicked out of the house. My parents haven't ever mention it at all but i know they will kick me out one day and i will end up on the street or under a bridge for the rest of my life. I have expressed this worry to my mom and she says I have nothing to worry about but I know she probably ran to my dad and told him I am onto them.

 12. I am quite. I am always asked if something is wrong by family members. I say nothing but I dont want to interrupt anyone and get them mad at me. 

 13. If I do stuff it must be perfect. I have been jumped on at every job I have had as I am not fast enough. I have this issue everywhere. In test, washing dishes, doing clothes. My mom has jumped on me for wasting water as it took me a hour and 20 minutes to watch 23 utinsels and plates and put them on a towel to dry. O get told that I will get faster as I learn to do stuff but I have done this stuff for a while. I must make sure everything is done right or I will have screwed up. And will think of it forever

 14. I have reoccurring nightmares of being bullied in school. It's always 1 of two different bullying events in school. These dreams happen once or twice a week.

The being perfect thing is probably the biggest thing I struggle with

A job is the worst thing for me in the world as I know when I am hired by HR they tell my soon to be co workers how I am and make my life hell. HR just hires me as they know how it will get my hopes up that maybe I can do something right. I usually end up leaving after 2 or 3 months after I get sat down by a boss for being too slow or not working well with a team. Or I am legit sick and miss a day. At that point I stay out that day thinking of all they are talking about me and I cant bring myself to go in and be harassed for being sick. I come up with stories to tell my family that I was let go for budget cuts or stuff. I've got to the point to where in this rural beach town I have ruined every job opportunity with these franchises/corporations. Those 2 to 3 months of my life at a job are always the worst for me mentally.

My family says everyone goes through this stuff regarding jobs and I don't understand. They say after a month I will feel normal and it doesnt.

I am sorry for the long post as I know that people hate long post but I need to get this stuff out. I have been trying to get this message done correctly for a bit. Edited it a few times as I worry that some stuff may sound embarrassing. Originally I had a list of 25 things. 

If you decided to stick around and read/reply to this, Thanks in advanced as I dont know when I'll have the courage to read the replies. If you couldn't make it all the way through I do appreciate your time too. Also mods I am sorry if I have screwed up in the rules.

2,"I have heard people say that you can’t control your thoughts, only how you react to them but if you are always going to have thoughts than how does one even determine that they are in recovery? How can that even be measured? It seems like it’s just this BS thing people throw around to get pats on the back. I talked to someone in “recovery” and honestly he was a mess, and he was very arrogant and manipulative. It really changed how I feel about recovery. I know we can get better and still have quality lives but the term just seems kind of meaningless. What do you think?",13Jan2019,1
3,"its very hard for me to explain it but theres certain periods of time where i feel like i cant get at all comfortable in my own skin. everything will become unbearably annoying and angering to me. i want to stop any noise i hear, yell at anyone who talks to me, and my own clothes feel really uncomfortable and awful against my body. additionally, i just cant relax. my room or whatever environment im in feels like its made of rocks regardless of if its a space i can usually be in without problems.

4,"I think I may have social anxiety but I’m scared to tell my parents because it might just be me overthinking it. I don’t know if what I feel is a normal thing or not. I’m always really nervous and I feel uncomfortable talking to new people because I feel like everyone I talk to is judging me. Even my parents and family, I just feel like everyone I talk to thinks I’m weird or hates me. I’ll be talking to someone and I just feel like when I look into their eyes they’re judging me and thinking how weird and awkward I am. I find it hard to make friends because of this. Ive pushes the few friends I had away because I feel like they all secretly hated me. Am I just weird?? Do people really see me as some annoying weird person?? Or is it probably just in my head? I feel fucking crazy right now I hate this. ",13Jan2019,1
5,"When my depression gets bad, I just lay In bed all day, watching YouTube, only getting out to get food from downstairs.

It technically isn’t that big a deal (just a college rejection, nothing life-altering), but it really hurts to start believing in yourself and then have your self-confidence utterly smashed.

8,"I know this title sounds strange but I'll try and explain it.
I recently went through a very difficult and very traumatic event that consisted of manic and depressive episodes, full on delusional and dissociative days, ending with multiple consecutive mental breaks. This lasted for about a year and I was in an inpatient clinic 2 or 3 times during all of this.

Prior to this I went through an ECT (Electroconvulsive  Therapy) treatment and I experienced many, many gaps in short and long term memory....My diagnosis was PTSD, Bipolar 2, and a few other things but the bipolar diagnosis was recently changed to borderline personality disorder. In the aftermath of my psychotic episode I slept a LOT... I mean a LOOTT ... And I kept telling myself that it was my mind's way of healing itself. 

After what I would call 'waking up' from this nightmare I consulted my mental health doctor and asked if he thought it would be wise to be taken off my meds, he asked why and I explained that my symptoms have been gone for months. He agreed and I have been off my meds ever since.

Now, I have been taking mental health meds my entire life..and not just a pill or two, but handfulls. So to go from all of that to nothing but multivitamins is a little jarring. Bit I accept it. I have been without my medication for 4 or so months now, and my family and friends say that I'm completely different in a very good way. Bit ever since this all happened it's like my emotions have been turned on. Everything I see around me moves me like it never has before...it feels like gaining something I never had. Like my empathy was ""broken"" or something, and now it works.

This leads to my question/ concern.

 Has anyone ever experienced this before? Does this make any sense to any of you? Is there cause for concern or does this happen sometimes? Is this possibly the cause of my ECT finally working?

Thank you so much for reading",13Jan2019,1

12,"It’s 8:00pm on a Saturday night and I’m awaiting my ambien you rock me a way. My wife and son are still up playing and watching television in the living room but I’m hoping to fall asleep soon because I’ve got to be back up again at 4:30am for work. Tomorrow will be my 14th day I’ve worked in a row averaging 11-12 hours a day. I’ve fought back tears all day around my son, all he has wanted since I got home was for me to hold him and sit on the floor with him to show me his LEGO set he built all by himself. He did an awesome job for a 5 yr old. I constantly fight the feeling that I’m not there for him as much as I should be. My schedule will straighten out late next week and I should be back on M-F (fingers crossed). I know he doesn’t understand why I have to work the way I do, but I hope that one day he will see I’ve done all of it for him to give him the best life he deserves. I do not want him turning out like me. I don’t know how to explain my story but I have never spoken aloud to anyone what was done to me when I was 7. Not even my wife knows. I’m now 33 and for some reason I’ve been having a harder and harder time with my past. I feel like there is a dark figure with a hand on my shoulder walking along beside me matching my footsteps. Some days I barley notice the presence, and others like today bring me to the verge of a breakdown. I have broken down to my wife in bed, but I always says it’s something it isn’t. I don’t know why I’m typing this out other than to vent or maybe seeing it in writing will help me. I’m not sure what I need to do to get a little bit of my sanity back. I know I couldn’t do life without my wife of 10 yrs. she keeps me happy, and suppresses my dark rider. I couldn’t do life without her. I know she’ll never see this, but A you have kept me happy and alive for 10 years and I owe my everything to you and our beautiful son. I’ve got to go now.",13Jan2019,1
13,"This last week and a half has been hell.  I started hitting my mental health journey really hard — choosing to do it during my last trimester of pregnancy is absolutely ridiculous but I guess when it’s right, it’s right. I started by seeing a woman who acted almost like a hub for psych resources. After I pretty much vomited my whole past to her and every issue I think I have, she was really helpful and worked with me to develop a few first steps...

Step 1) Get back into counseling and start a more honest routine

Step 2) Wait 13 more weeks, until after I’ve given birth, to get back on my meds that worked and to start investigating whether or not I have 
        • CPTSD/PTSD
        • Bipolar, I think type 2? 
        • Major depression
        • Some yet undefined anxiety disorder.

They also want to monitor me a lot for postpartum, just in case.

Ok, so... Good. I have a plan.
I also feel like a complete freak. I know that prior to my pregnancy we had just started navigating through whether or not my ADD survived into adulthood. We started Strattera, it completely changed everything for 3 months (I was *free!*), then I stopped taking it when we found out about Baby Willow... I’ve just been waiting around for March to come so I can resume loving my life again, no pregnancy and no major mental health issues... Just a happy family and a happy life that I get to look forward to. This is great!

Except... Once I started going back to counseling, we agreed (and I do think it’s really wise) to do group sessions 3x a week and a 1 on 1 session every Monday at 3. So, this looks like:
        
      Monday @ 3: 1/1
      Tuesday @ 1: DBT group
      Wednesday: Women’s group
      Thursday: Mindfulness

Each session is an hour so it’s 4 hours/week of really hitting it. The downside: since I started, I cannot relax. I’m so damn anxious; I’m having these really constant anxiety attacks that come over me at the weirdest times. I can’t enjoy anything and that makes me even more anxious, like I’m a big burden to try to entertain or to get to snap out of it. My poor boyfriend... he’s been so above and beyond during all of this. He’s so positive and ready to help me. This just seems so stupid, why can I not refocus and try to see the positive in anything? For me, for him, for our son and for the baby we’re expecting, I am so done being this sadness junky. That’s the best way I can put it, it’s like I thrive on sadness and depression...

My brain is 24/7 worry, panic, sadness, anger. On the outside I’m so bubbly and trying to help others, trying to appear really upbeat and like nothing is wrong but I sincerely think that people can see through it way better than I think they can. They definitely can when I crack and it all comes pouring out of me... then the jig is up and I let my mask fall off. It’s everything in me that does *not* want to be this person. But, time and time again, that’s just who I am.

In my head, I’m replaying everything that I’ve ever done wrong, all the people I’ve ever pissed off, convincing myself that I’m the worst partner and I’m going to be too much for my kids to want a relationship with... the other alternative is constantly replaying the stuff others have done to me and being mad as hell at them. It just doesn’t stop.

I know why I do this, I mean I’ve been writing that list up for myself, mentally, for years. And it’s so weird, it’s like somehow in all of this I finally just saw it for the first time and understood why I’m this extremely negative person to be around and why I completely flip out every time I’m slightly stressed. 

I am a *sadness junky* so wrapped up in having to feel depressed in order to feel like life is normal. I think it’s easier for me to believe that I’m going to live and die this way than it is to *get real* and realize that I’m a freaking badass who survived through *a lot* of bad crap that nobody should have to go through. I don’t want to be this person at all anymore. I want to be the person who sees somebody else who’s like the current me, and can teach them and show them that they’re just as capable of moving mountains and reaching their goals. I want to *smash life* and watch myself turn into this supernova person I know I am on the inside. If I die tomorrow and this is the way I let myself spend my final years... just, no way. I couldn’t rest easy, this is probably my new biggest fear.

I think I’m really ready to do this right. It took me almost until I reached 30 to do it, and I’m really mad at myself for letting that much time go by, but if I get just 20 more years of happiness, surrounded by my family, watching everything go up and up from here... I’ll pick that over watching another 20 years go by without ever tackling anything on my bucket list because I was too damn afraid to let myself do it, for fear that I may actually have to learn how to be happy and healthy. 

I don’t know why I felt so determined to write this here. I know this isn’t a blog or my personal soap box, but maybe somebody else needed to see someone going through what they’re going through. Maybe somebody else can tell me that they made it and that it’s just as possible as my mind is set to believe it is, at this moment at least. I’m thinking of writing about this journey more, like a record of the before and after. Wouldn’t it be cool if, by the time Willow is here, I could tell you all that the positive won and my life wasn’t lived for nothing?

I think it would be the greatest gift to be able to at least say that to my anxious, depressed, angry, critical self. I am so ready to live. I am so ready to conquer this and let the real me shine out. I’m ready to show people who I truly am and that they made the right decision by not giving up on me. I want to leave something really good behind, and to say that I did it because I chose to be strong in my weakest moments — even when I felt like a freak, and a stranger to myself. I want this, I need this, and, damnit, I’m really going to do this. Wish me luck!


PS: For the love of god, can somebody please help me come up with a middle name for Willow?! Help me solve some of my anxiety (haha!) because we can’t think of a single name that seems right! 

Thank you for reading, and may your own journey be blessed with easier answers. I’m always here to talk to anyone who’s stuck in a mental rut like me.",13Jan2019,1
14,"I'll try keep this short, oh and btw I think it's worth mentioning I suffer with Bipolar if that may affect this case at all.

Okay, I hold a really high opinion of myself, massivly so, I probably wouldn't go with cocky, I hardly brag much if ever, but I love compliments (although who doesn't, right?), I'll even outright give imperative verbs such as; ""pay me a compliment please"", to put it simply. I love hearing and being told I look good, or I've lost weight, or that I'm a genius, things like that. I very often stare into the mirror, just because why not, I look good. I wouldn't say I'm better than anyone else, but I often get annoyed when I think someone is stupid, although I try and realise that that isn't okay, and try to better myself and keep words to myself if I have nothing nice to say. Oh and I love being told that I'm hilarious. So not gonna lie, I have a massive ego, but I think I realise that it pertains and try to keep it on the down low. I am in no way a ""player"", or ladies man, but have no trouble talking to either men or women alike, I just don't like to get around much.

15,"I’m 35 and prior to 2018 year had never dated before...the reasons are that I’m physically debilitated with arthritis, can only do call center work, have no talent, and am a deeply introverted, lousy conversationalist with no wit. I’ve avoided dating because my prospects are so bad I haven’t even been willing to try. I still live with my dad in my childhood bedroom, and my life revolves around saving money to spend on an offshore stem cell treatment for my joints, which I depend on to survive, but can't get in the US because it's not FDA-approved.

  
In Jan 2018 I started work at a new call center, where a very attractive (for her age) 40 year old female member of the training staff quickly took a liking to me and became flirtatious. She would compliment my hair and outfit, call me sexy, touch me, and dropped a few overtly sexual bombs on me that I had literally no reply for.  She was very intelligent, super social, and a brilliant conversationalist with a wicked wit—the exact opposite of my personality. She was smarter and wittier than me to the point I was intimidated by her, so rather than flirt back, I ignored her and shut her down. I felt like it was the only card I had to play. She seemed to take it as a challenge at kept going hard. I feigned disinterest, but in reality I was always very attracted to her, and over the months, this developed into the biggest crush of my life.  
I should note she wasn’t completely unprofessional. We had a fantastic working relationship, she was an amazing mentor, and she gave me the skills to be successful.  
This pattern of her flirting and me shutting her down continued for about five months until one night she added me of Facebook and came onto me hard with a serious proposition to get together outside of work. She didn’t say exactly what she wanted, but she was very sexual. She said she had been celebate for several years, and clearly wanted to end that streak with me. I wanted her so bad, but I shut her down again, because I knew we weren’t a match. During the course of that conversation, I did admit my attraction to her. That was all the permission she needed to keep working on me, and two weeks later, I finally agreed to go out with her.  
We dated casually for five weeks. It was a combination of fun and awkwardness. I absolutely loved her and loved spending time with her, but I had no idea what I was doing and made constant mistakes in dealing with her. The worst of which was that I was sexually timid and afraid to admit what I wanted… afraid to show any form of sexual interest… and I acted like a platonic friend most of the time. There was an opportunity to have sex with her one night and I didn’t do it because the date hadn’t gone well prior to that and I just wanted it to end. I made tons of other mistakes. I dated like a 14 year old.  Over time I showed her that I had no confidence, no self-esteem, no ability to deal with women. By July I had developed a deep attachment to her. I dd my damndest to hide my feelings because I knew she was the less interested party. She just wanted to have fun, I was in love with her.  
In mid-july, she went cold on me literally overnight. Like a switch flipped and the lights just went out, she shut down on me. She never explicitly said we were done, but she stopped texting first, stopped flirting, ignored me at work, stopped inviting me to hang out after, and only socialized with me in a group setting with our mutual friends.  If I texted first she would reply, but otherwise I’d never hear from her. She started sending signals like referring to us as “friends” and saying other things in front of me, but not directly to me. I tried to play it off like I was unbothered and agreed that we should just be friends… inside I was distraught that I was losing her and tried to garner up the balls to talk to her, but the writing on the wall was so clear that I never did. She had lost interest and was delivering her rejection in a passive-aggressive way.  
This phase of platonic contact lasted for three weeks. Then one night she dropped the bomb in our group text that she was planning to hook up with someone else that night. What really fucked me up about this was, four weeks prior, she had made plans to spend that weekend with me. So she blew me off, replaced me in her sex plans with someone else, and texted it where she knew I would read it. I don’t think she did it as an intentional slight aimed at me. She was just being herself, sharing her personal life with friends, which I had acted like I was fine with being.  
But I couldn’t keep up the bullshit fake friendship any longer. I was absolutely devastated and fucked up beyond anything. At that point I cut contact and unfriended her on FB. I quit my job at the call center and was unemployed for six fuckng weeks. I only saw her once and communicated with her a few times after that. Each time things went downhill. The last time we talked, she called to tell me she could get me re-hired (normally you have to wait 6 weeks to re apply after quitting suddenly). I accepted the offer, but told her I’d be looking for something else and that “I’d rather smash my nuts with a hammer for 40 hours a week than keep working there.” She rescinded the offer and told me not to come even after I apologized profusely. That was the last time we talked.  
It’s been five months since I’ve seen or talked to her. I got a new job, one that pays two-third as much (due to fewer hours offered), and the commute is three times as long. She’s out of sight, but not out of mind. I think about her every day. I tell myself it’s over, she rejected me, I have no chance with her ever again, and I need to act like she doesn’t exist. But I can’t because she fucking does exist and I know this for a fact because the other day I was trying to move on and found her on tinder.  
This shit with her cuts so deep and hurts so bad. The only woman I ever had mutual attraction with, who chased me for months, decided I was unfuckable and unlovable and lost interest once she got to know me better. I have such strong feelings for her, I could never just be friends with her. But she doesn’t even want me as a friend. She doesn’t even care enough about me to hate me. She probably doesn’t even think of me. Just acts like I don’t exist.  
If I could do it over again I would do everything so much different. That night she made an excuse to bring me home, led me to her bedroom and invited me to lay down on her bed with her? I would have fucked her and cum on her face and taken pictures instead of saying I was comfortable in the recliner and pretending to pass out. Little things like that.My six month exile from the old call center is up in three weeks and I have to go back... I just dropped $30,000 on an offstore stem cell treatment and then crashed my car the week after, now I’m broke af and I need the overtime money. The old place is the only place I know where I can pull $3500-4000 a month. I can’t spend 3-4 hours a day commuting for $14/hr anymore. I have to go back to where she is. And I know the real reason I want to go back isn’t even for the fucking money I need so desperately, but to let her see me ignoring the fuck out of her again in the far-fetched hope it will re-attract her.

20,"I’m 17 years old and I’m feeling like shit so to help myself I’m going to just vent about EVERYTHING. I might have spelling mistakes and grammar problems I’m sorry. I haven’t been to school since my 16th birthday.  (Trigger warning : cancer, rape, sexual abuse, child abuse, abandonment, drug abuse)

Technically my moms pregnancy was statutory rape due to my parents age difference she was 17 but nothing was held against my dad. They split up early on because although my mom had pretty much stopped doing drugs my dad hadn’t. He would get high on crack cocaine and stalk my mom at night threw her window. Eventually my crack head father left state because some people where trying to kill him so I was brought into this world basically without a father. Not that big of a problem, a lot of little girls don’t have dads now a days. 

 When I was in elementary school we went to visit family and I was sexually touched. Kept silent for years, I think during that same year was the year my mom got cancer. Her fiancé left her and we were almost homeless so out of desperation we moved in with my papa who I don’t remember being in my life much before then. We moved to the middle of nowhere and had almost nothing. I remember eating half alive worms still moving in my chili. 

 My mom got with a guy who was like a family friend for a while. I’d already met him and he was really cool he was so nice to me and gave me everything I wanted, candy, chocolates, he would download movies, he had a house and my own room. We moved in with him and things were cool for a little while until my mom started hitting me.....a lot. They both started drinking more and my mom started smoking cigarettes. Every weekend they would get drunk and my mom would pass out in bed and he would try and be sexual with me almost every single weekend. 

 I got my first ever iPod touch. I vented online a lot about how things where at home. I had no therapy and social anxiety from years of abuse took hold of me and I had no real friends. My mom found my texts of me telling someone I trusted I was being sexually abused by a family member and she slapped my face and threw me in the bed and called me a stupid whore. She told me our family member wouldn’t do that and she will call and tell everyone. I cried so much and begged and told her it was true but she was in so much denial. 


 My mom used to hold my hair in a pony tail and smash my head against the wall over and over and the wooden dresser we had in our closet. She used to pick me up by my hands so I couldn’t run and beat me with a wooden ruler for not eating food due to depression. I told her and her boyfriend once that I was suicidal and my first symptoms of psychosis but they IGNORED ME and looked me in my eyes and told me I wouldn’t have the balls to kill myself and if I ever wanted to they’d give me the gun. 


  My mom had kicked me out at 13 with nothing not even shoes on my feet. Abuse at home was so bad I walked about 5 miles in the Arizona summer barefoot to get to the nearest friends house. By the time I got there my feet were blistered and I couldn’t walk properly for about three straight days. I stayed for three days until her mom was worried they’d be charged with harboring a run away and they made me go home..... at home my mom was pissed off. Not happy to see me or anything. I ended up living with my grandma who had cancer at the time and taking care of her. 


  My mom got ahold of My dad who I didn’t know at the time and told them I was a troubled teen and that she doesn’t want me and within three days I packed up everything I owned and said goodbye to everything I knew to move across the United States to be with people I’ve never met before. The first year was good other then my dad being an alcoholic and us losing the house and going foreclosure. My mental health dropped a lot during my second year. I was hospitalized multiple times and was taking abilify (antipsychotic) at 15 years old. I was extremely homicidal, doing cocaine and mdma almost every day, and self harming constantly and excessively. 


  I cheated on my boyfriend at the time with my drug dealer and word got out I was selling myself for drugs which wasn’t true at all. The school got involved and wanted to open a cps investigation on my parents for neglect which I thought was fucked up because cps never disturbed my actually abusive mom, even after trying to tell teachers. I ended up moving back with my mom because I forgave her. She told me she changed, that her and my step dad stopped drinking and I wanted to just get clean. 


 Back at my moms I did good. I got my permit, my ged, two jobs I kept for over a year and everything was amazing until my step dad started drinking again and abusing me. One night while my mom was out working my step dad grabbed me by my choker (it was a thick belt like collar I’m into alternative fashion) and he pushed me over the bathtub. I was scared and locked my bedroom door. I told my mom and nothing happened about it. She’s so stupid. She’s caught him watching step daughter step dad porn, me AND my little sister had told her multiple times he’s tried to TOUCH us, he’s cheated on her, he lies and drinks behind her back, they fight, I don’t know why she’s still with him.


I ended up living with my bestfriend and her mom since they saw my bruises and told them what happened. My bestfriend is also a first hand look at what happened to me. She’s watched my mom chase me with a frying pan, watched my step dad climb on top of me with his fists in the air about to punch me, I stayed with her until early of last year until she left to another state to see her boyfriend.


When I came back to my house I started talking to this really nice man. Has a job, a car, has his shit together just like me. He was afew states away tho but he was willing to wait for me and date online. He visited me last summer for the first time and we hit it off so good and I stayed with him for a week. I ended up visiting him aswell in his home state and it was really really good. 


  After my 17th birthday my mom got mad he was a Mexican out of the blue and we got in a fight she ended up kicking me out and I couch hoped a lot. Sometimes I wasn’t sure if I’d have to sleep at a park or not. It was very very hard. But I kept working until I had enough money to get a plane ticket to be with my boyfriend.


I’m here now and safer, my bestfriend who’s now pregnant doesn’t want to talk to me because I’m always “negative” and she doesn’t need negativity when she’s having a baby but I haven’t talked to my family in almost over 80 straight days now. It’s so hard to be happy. My sister says my mom doesn’t even ask about me or talk about me. I relapsed today and now need stitches but I am too poor to afford anything health related. I have no friends and I’m mentally ill with psychosis ptsd and depression. Last time I was hospitalized and was in outpatient it was end of 2017.  Right before I left to go live back with my mom

I’ve lost everyone and everything other then my boyfriend who doesn’t even deserve to have to be with someone like me. I feel like a burden on everyone. Even my old friends from Washington are saying it’s my fault because I made the choice to come back to get clean and a job.

21,"I have GAD. I haven’t formally been diagnosed with ADHD but I have always suspected I have it. I have a symptom that I’m curious about.

Whenever I get interested in something, I get super obsessive and feel compelled to know all the parameters and dive in immediately. The logical thing to do is slowly immerse myself and build up knowledge over time. But instead, I get anxious and feel like I need to do it all at once. Often I get so hyper focused and hyper involved that I burn myself out and ultimately lose interest. It also burns me out financially.

Some examples:

* I am very into houseplants, and rapidly accumulated 70 plants, so many that I had to buy a greenhouse. It sounds very innocent but it really is an insane amount of plants and they aren’t cheap.
* I decided I needed to read the news more. I felt that print media was the right path. I spent hours researching every possibility and ended up subscribing to several magazines and The NY Times. It took me so much time to read all the material every day that I barely had time to do anything else. It was all I did. I felt like I HAD to get through all the material every day.
* My boyfriend got me a Nintendo Switch and during my winter break I got super involved with a couple of games. I played Stardew Valley and then later Zelda:BOTW all day, every day. And I mean it; that is ALL I did. I was up far later than normal at night, and would wake up early to play (and I’m very obsessive about my sleep. I use the sleep cycle app to track my sleep quality and get very anxious and upset about anything that interferes with my 8-9 hours of sleep per night. I also have trouble getting out of bed). Since finishing those games I haven’t even touched the Switch. -I binge watch TV shows -Online shopping is a burden. I feel like I need to explore EVERY option and will spend hours deliberating. Often I end up buying far more than I need. -Tea, wine, skincare products, hair care products, etc anything I get interested in, causes the aforementioned online shopping problem, which leads to impulsive over spending and an accumulation of whatever I have become infatuated with. -These are symptoms I have experienced my whole life- when I was a child it was dogs and horses. I was active in dog training and horseback riding, and spent so much time doing each that I surpassed my peers abilities very quickly, and easily won competitions. Eventually my interested waned. I have managed to keep myself involved in horseback riding by seeking out new, stimulating experiences- playing polo in college, joining a new stable that teaches eventing (which is NOT an easy discipline, so it has stimulated me for now)

TLDR; super intense hyper focus with new interests and hobbies that causes financial strain, stress, feeling like I can’t stop which triggers anxiety, and inevitably ends in burnout.

I am being tested for ADHD later this year. I have been diagnosed with GAD and my former therapist said I have symptoms of OCD. The symptoms I am describing I have always associated with ADHD- the hyper focus, obsessions, diminishing interest.

I would like to work toward lessening the severity of my problem and thought that determining its source would be a good starting point.

Do these symptoms correlate more with ADHD, GAD or OCD?

Note: This is a specific set of symptoms, not all of my mental health symptoms.",13Jan2019,1

23,"I don't have a huge group of friends, just 3 or so, and we don't see each other too often.

My fiance went to a friends house tonight and before he left we had a fight.

Don't know what the point of this was, just feeling a little extra lonely/depressed tonight. ",13Jan2019,1
24,"For the longest time, I've been fighting this want for love, affection, and acceptance. I remember in kindergarten, being abandoned by my mom a lot. I was left home often, one time that led to a fire in the kitchen and having to move apartments. And other times of just crying for my mother to comfort me but her laughing at me and ignoring me. I have these distinct memories of being unwanted from my mother. 

Fast forward a bit to later elementary and junior high, it was common occurrence for me to wait hours for NY mother to pick me up. I would wait in the school office other times outside on the bench by myself. I waited in the junior bathroom for hours or underneath a desk at church, waiting for her to remember. There was a time my principal had to take me home because they could never get in contact with my mother (who has always been a stay at home mom). 

In high school, I got berated by my brother a lot. A lot of physical abuse (I'm a female, 2 years younger than him). Him punching and kicking me escalated his high school senior year.

Needing to prepare for a standardized test, I needed my computer (that he often took to play video games on without permission because he broke his) so I went into his room to look for it. He had hid it from me and refused to give it to me. When I refused to leave, he pulled my hair into the hallway and threw me to the ground, plummetting me with kicks and punches. I just sat there on the ground, embracing myself for each hit. My mother never comforted me nor reprimanded him, she actually watched most of it happen. Later when she came into my room, she laughed at me. I wanted to die then. I called the suicide hotline; I believed this was my end. 

That was nearly three years ago, but tonight I had a trigger and the memories flooded back. I don't know how to navigate my family. I don't want to be dependent on them whatsoever anymore. I wanted to make amends and have been trying really hard to this year, but it's not going anywhere after what happened tonight. What do I do? Do I cut all ties and move on? ",13Jan2019,1
26,"So, I went through a lot of sexual abuse from ages 15-17, but I'm pretty sure something happened before then too, as I'm having a lot of reactions as if it had happened physically (while the aforementioned years of sexual abuse were from online predators). I find it near impossible to eat anything white, especially if it's liquidy (I gag eating anything with whipped cream on it, and have an anxiety attack when any of it falls out of my mouth, and I can't even stand to look at most things like ranch and mayo). Human sexual anatomy wholly and truly disgusts me, and though I try to get better about it, I end up dissociating severely if I think about human penises for too long (especially semen). Even mentions of rape and sexual abuse, if I'm not expecting them, are *severe* triggers for me, often sending me into a state of paranoia, twitchiness, and self-loathing for the rest of the day. When I get this way, I sometimes end up reading rape fanfiction as a form of self-harm. It always makes me miserable.

I have *a lot* of trouble with repressed memories; I'm only now remembering some of the things that were done to me in childhood. Most notably, my best friend when I was 7-9 (1st-3rd grade), Ryan, severely abused me emotionally, and I don't know if he may have done anything to me sexually. People around me say that I changed very much in third grade, becoming more quiet, insecure, and depressed, and other bad signs. It seemed like I got slightly better after that, but the same thing happened in sixth grade where I suddenly developed extreme dysphoria and dysmorphia, anorexia, depression, anxiety, and intense self-esteem issues, seemingly overnight.

I don't have memories of anything sexual happening to me physically. These are the only cases of abuse I remember (in chronological order from when they started):

\- My father severely neglected and emotionally abused me and my younger siblings, and I often had to caretake him due to how unstable he was  
\- My mother was (and still is) convinced that there is no way she could be a bad parent, as my father is ""so much worse."" I still live with her due to my inability to be self-sufficient because of my trauma, and the daily emotional manipulation is tiring. She's only gotten worse with the years, and she'll never admit she's messed up.  
\- Ryan was a friend (though he did establish that we were going to get married and murder people together) who verbally and emotionally abused and manipulated me for three years at a very young age, gaslighted and guilt tripped me, degraded me, threatened me, and I think at times physically hurt me, though I can't recount examples. Against my better judgement, I talked to him recently, and he hasn't changed.  
\- Maddy was a friend who degraded and emotionally manipulated me for three years as well, but she was probably the least bad of the bunch. She was the first one I ever recognized as an abuser, despite having gone through abuse before (albeit unrecognized).  
\- Dominique was an online acquaintance (I was about 15, while she was 20+) who constantly coerced and guilt tripped me into sexual roleplays, and constantly forced them on me while I was at school, roleplaying herself crying and hurting herself when I told her I needed to pay attention to class. We only talked for a couple weeks.  
\- Eden was a long-distance boyfriend who, over the course of 6 months, constantly sexually and emotionally abused me, manipulating me for nudes and saying the most awful things that ensured I would stay with him and conform to what *he* liked in a person. It took me 2 tries to break up with him, and he threatened suicide both times. He did more than what I've listed, but it's a lot to go into.  
\- Lauren was a long-distance girlfriend (she was almost 19, I was barely 16) who constantly threatened suicide and guilt tripped me into sexual roleplays. She confessed to me by venting about how I would never like her back, and when I told her that I ""did like her, but didn't want to date right now"" she seemed to accept it, but the next day was telling our whole friend group that we were dating. She lied and manipulated using fabricated stories of abuse happening to her, and often called me her ""pet"" without my consent. When I broke up with her, she talked about how her only use was helping people learn more about themselves and then being disposed. She IP tracked me and was planning to move into my house without my consent.

That's all I can recount at the moment. But I'm sure there things I'm not remembering, notably people, and experiences with Ryan.

When I talked to Ryan, as gaslighting and guilt trippy as he was, he denied doing anything sexual to me. And I'm almost inclined to believe him, but I'm also terrified to believe him. I don't think he was the source of *all* my sexual trauma (some of the triggers don't make sense, as he was transgender \[FtM\]), but I have a slight feeling he might be. I have dreadful feelings surrounding the one night he slept over at my house when I was 9. We slept in the same bed, and I could barely stay awake, but he kept trying to talk to me. My memory of the night is very hazy, as I was barely conscious, but I have many, many intrusive thoughts and nightmares about that night, and thinking about it makes my chest hurt. I don't know if there was any case of COCSA on that night, but I wouldn't be surprised if there was; and at the same time, I'm terrified to find out if there wasn't, as I already worry that maybe I'm just making all this up for attention (I don't think I am, but I get paranoia like that). I have vague memories of feelings of hands touching me, though they don't feel securely connected to any chronological memories; I also have memories, with no real surrounding setting, of Ryan being uncomfortably close to me.

Another case is sixth grade, where I have some vague memories of distress in a classroom, though no memory of what people may have done to me. I believe it was a couple of boys, if it was anyone, but I only really remember the desks and classroom. And the fear, though it's vague.

I don't know if this is a sign of anything, but from ages 8-10, I would play a game with my friends called ""Vagina, Butt, Butt."" We would get naked and pelvic thrust our crotches together, then our butts, while chanting ""vagina, butt, butt."" This may have just been something normal; it definitely seemed normal at the time.

Thoughts on whether anything really happened to me that I'm repressing? I can't really have much of a view on it myself given how biased I am, with my fear of nothing having happened, but my girlfriend does believe something happened, though neither of us know exactly what.",13Jan2019,1
27,"As some of you may know, aerosols are hallucinogens. Inhaling a 330ml can of aerosol is like experiencing a 12h LSD trip condensed into 20-30 minutes.  Now, for me this was a form of escapism. I suffered with depression and would use hallucinogens to escape for a breif time. Due to the nature of hallucinogens, this half hour trip felt like 4-6 hours. I abused solvents every single day, never missing a day from the age of 12-16. 

There were times when I was trapped in a BT commercial, times when my bedroom was a beach and a squid-like mermaid attacked my face. Then there were darker times.

One of these times causes a lot of damage to my perception of reality. I woke up and walked to school. I did my day to day stuff in school and at 1pm went for lunch. I blinked and I was laid in my bed staring at the wall. The 5 hours from being awake to lunch had only been 7 minutes. Everything was vividly real, it was a shock to the system. 

My mum absolutely hates animals. I have never been allowed a pet because of this. I have frequently hallucinated my mum violently throwing cats at my wall, screaming ""CATS, CATS, CATS, CATS, CATS"" getting faster and faster as it happened. As comedic as this sounds, it was traumatising at the time.

Another time my bed turned into a giant wasp that wrapped its legs around me and starting biting into my shoulder. Everything felt real. I could hear its wings buzzing, getting more and more distressed in sound. I could feel the warmth of its body on my back. I could feel the pain of its pincers in my shoulder and blood pouring down my chest. Horrifying.

When I first started taking it, I had a good trip every time.  Then I had my first bad trip, transparent spiders with wings flying under my eyelids. The only way to permanently get rid of them was to grab their wings handing out of my eyelids and slide their giant wings out of my eye and snap them in half. I'm aware this is all fake, but the experience was real, that is what's important.

Then when I experienced my first bad trip, they got more prevalent. Then it was a 50/50 chance of getting a bad trip. Now I cannot take aerosols without having a bad trip and that's the worst part. I didn't willingly choose to stop abusing solvents, I'm too scared to take it anymore. I have been clean for 5 years and I'm still mentally dependant on it. I still crave it. I still can't have a can of deodorant or hairspray in sight of me and not have a craving to take it and be out of touch with reality for 30 minutes. It was an escape. 


My counsellor doesn't see this though. She only understands that I have seen things and that it was imaginary. She doesn't understand how real it was to me at the time or how much it's traumatised me. She doesn't understand the damage it has done to me. Only that I was an addict and now ""I'm not"". She doesn't get that despite not taking the drug for 5 years I am still dependant.",13Jan2019,1

30,"Hi, I’m 15 and I haven’t been diagnosed with any sort of mental illness, and I don’t want to be self-diagnosing myself since that isn’t a healthy thing to do. For a little less than a year now I’ve always been having to reassure myself over and over, every single day and every hour, that “I’m not dead, I’m not dying, I’m never going to die”.  This sort of all stemmed from me always being anxious about death, and so I went to my guidance counsellor about something unrelated to this and she told me about something called a self-fulfilling prophecy, where if you think something will happen it will.  I took it the wrong way and thought as a way to deal with my anxiety I’d just tell myself that “I’m not dead, I’m not dying, I’m never going to die”. Which I also understand isn’t in the case because I know at some point we all do, since it’s inevitable. But I really just can’t stop having to reassure myself and it’s become extremely tiring for awhile now. I haven’t been to the doctors despite wanting to mainly because I’m afraid. I’m so scared that there isn’t anything wrong with me at all and I’d feel embarrassed, and not only that, I won’t have an explanation to why I’ve had to keep reassuring myself or feeling anxious over death for so long. I don’t know, I feel like I have OCD magical thinking, but again I don’t want to self-diagnose myself and I talked to a teacher about this and she told me I was just “quirky” lol. I just feel so tired and unhappy every single day having to constantly reassure myself over something I know is stupid, but I still have to do it. I hate how it’s so hard for me to have a conversation with people because I have to pause and reassure myself over and over. I have to keep reassuring myself in multiples of 3 or 5 over and over until it feels right, which I hate having to do. I just feel bad because not only do I have to reassure myself, I have to ask my friends to reassure me too and tell me that “I’m not dead, I’m not dying, I’m never going to die” which I hate having to do because I’m sure it gets tiring for them as well. I just want to feel happy and not have to worry about this all the time. I just don’t know if this is worth going to the doctors about, because my parents tell me I’m fine, and my teacher told me that she’s seen a lot of teenagers with mental health issues and she also thinks I’m fine. So I guess I’m just afraid they’re right and it’ll be embarrassing if I go to the doctors and nothing will be wrong with me, because I also think if there is something wrong with me, maybe I’d want to go to the doctors despite what they say but I’m not putting in any effort to get help?

Hello everyone,

So I have/had a pretty severe anxiety disorder that reached its peak just over a year ago, essentially I constantly felt like I was dying and there was nothing I could do about it and I was going to drop dead any second, on top of this I had all the classic health anxiety and generalised anxiety symptoms, plus a few OCD like behaviours. 

I went to GP and tried medications until I found one that worked and went to therapy, about a month ago I stopped my meds due to gaining 20kg on the pills which made me suicidal and brought out some other mental health issues that were overshadowed by the anxiety but related to it. On the meds I was much better, my anxiety was still higher than 'normal' but I can cope with it 90% of the time I'm fine. Since I have stopped the meds I feel the same as I did on then pretty ok. I feel guilty that I feel ok, I expected it to go back to me calling the ambulance every day convinced I was having a stroke but it hasn't yet. I'm anxious about the fact I'm not anxious, I feel like I should be anxious, I feel like I should be 'sicker'. I feel like I'm meant to be anxious, I have been anxious my whole life. I don't know why I'm not as bad anymore, now that I stopped meds I should go back to how I was because I didn't find therapy helpful so I don't see how that changed anything, my therapist thinks maybe its because I have changed my circumstances in my life that could have been causing me stress but I don't feel like much has changed. I'm also in uni I study 6-8 hours a day on top of uni I would do anything to get a perfect grade so I think im definitely under more pressure than I was so I don't understand why I'm not losing my mind.

 I know I should be happy i'm less anxious and I am but I feel like its wrong almost like I'm meant to be anxious. I am definitely not mentally healthy I have other issues but my anxiety was the biggest issue and now I'm not anxious I almost feel like I failed at being sick or I somehow wasn't actually ever sick it makes no sense. ",13Jan2019,1

36,"My girlfriend is mentaly not very stable, as she told me that when she is completely alone, she starts to cry because the memory of her old school comes back were she got bullied for many years and also did self harm on her arm at that time. Her parents, which argue very loudly almost every evening, which didn't help her that much at that time of the bullying. Her mother noticed the self harm and searched for a therapist, which didn't work because most of the therapist in the area had a waiting time of a year (that search was 2-3 years ago). My girlfriend also get's really pressoured by her mother to learn for her drivers licence everyday, even though she has big problemes in school that she doesn't agnolage and still has to learn for tests and in school, this already brought her to a breaking point many time but she cant tell that to her mother because she shrugs it off as, being too lazy.
A few weeks back I was on vacation at my girlfriends place, we were cuddling in bed while her parents had an argument again. This triggerd my panic attack (my parents also had loud arguments and I cant stand a loud volume most of the times) which ended up in me screaming for silence, she was calming me down and then closed all the doors to make it a bit more quiet. That was the moment where I thought that I couldnt just sit around anymore. I told my girlfriend many times to start and look for a therapist again but she still thinks that the waiting is going to be very long.

I want to bring this to get mother now as she didn't tell her anything about my panic attack, her feeling of being pressoured from all the learning and and bullying back at her old school. How should I tell this to get mother? ",13Jan2019,1

I believe in the monotony of life, some of us grow complacent and become content with the routines in our life.

These routines stopped me from recognizing how much potential I have and limited my growth as a human.

 To anyone looking for a unique viewpoint and a change of perspective, take a few minutes and let me know what you think.

Thank you!

39,"I have been haunted by this what I don't know is a memory of nightmare from when I was younger that I was taken advantage of, I woke up from sleep while in the middle of it and remember the person who it was and I remember saying no and then I guess from what I remember fading out back into sleep? Then waking up in the morning again. I just thought of it as being a dream but I remain disturbed by it because it was so real but I just have to keep telling myself that it was a dream. I never have talked about this with anyone except for my therapist. It still gets in my head constantly and I just shrivel and freeze. I've tried digging into that moment trying to see if I could get some more recollection. This has been haunting me for 4 years now, whether it was a dream or if it actually happened but I just am telling myself its a dream to protect myself from what would then be a suppressed memory. Last night I was put under an uncomfortable position bc of reasons that may be too complicated to explain;when I went to sleep, I feel what seemed to be from that same night of the previous memory/dream but a different thing that happened where my mouth was being covered and I was screaming. I'm just so tired of not knowing if I'll ever know the truth but more importantly how to get over this. All I recall is that short snip and now this new part. I don't know what to do.",13Jan2019,1
40,"My brain always has to go and make up ideas to ruin any happiness that I have-- which doesn't happen often, but when it comes it's just an incredible feeling I never want to let go off. 

Couple of days ago, I met up with this guy that I've been talking to for a while now. We're both interested in each other and we both thought it was a good idea. I never dated anyone before and I was nervous about everything.

But after just being with them for just five minutes, I felt so safe and happy. The night was great. I still can't stop thinking about it. 

But my brain ruined it. I'm bombarded with thoughts that the person doesn't care about me, that the evening was just a one night stand kind of thing. 

Even though they told me positive things, my brain is ruining it all and I don't know how to stop it. I don't know how to talk to them about this because I feel like it will be too much for them. 

I was hurt by someone in the past that I technically never dated, but the two of us were clearly on the same mindset. It took me four years to get over what happened with them. I'm scared that I'll get hurt like this again too and I can't afford that pain again.",13Jan2019,1

42,"i posted awhile ago that i was going off of lexapro, but there were some complications behind it (hello if you remember me!). anywho, i am officially off of it and have been for the past four weeks now. i haven’t really had any symptoms from going off and i was wondering if this is normal? i weened myself off from 10 mg to 5 mg and did that for a few weeks. i noticed while i was still on 10 mg, i would sometimes miss a few days and feel horrible withdraw symptoms. such as lightheaded and almost like a “high” feeling, very dizzy and sometimes disoriented. like i said, being completely off of it for the past four weeks i’ve had no symptoms. i felt lightheaded a few times, but that’s it. is this normal? should i be expecting something? or am i really just that lucky.",13Jan2019,1
43,"When I was 12, I had a gnarly fever of about 102°F. During that time, I had a nightmare that woke me up crying. I couldn't recall what it was about, nor can I to this day. Ever since then, (and I don't know how to explain it,) if I have a certain thought process, it triggers a sense of dread that radiates all over my body and sends a chill up my spine. I know I can get triggered when I play that old Flash game Bubble Trubble, or sometimes when I build massive structures in creative mode of Minecraft. (In fact I think the dream may have been Minecraft-esque long before the game even came out.) I can't describe the exact thought process; I don't know how to put it into words. I've been meaning to bring this up to my therapists over the years, but I either forget to because we were busy talking about primary issues, or I'm too embarrassed. The closest I ever came to figuring out what this was, was some kind of PTSD, but I can't imagine getting that from an unidentifiable fever-dream... Can you?",13Jan2019,1
44,"So I've been struggling a bit recently. I don't want to self diagnose but I know for a fact that there just isn't something right with me. For the past couple months I've been hallucinating and just feeling really really down. Although for the past few years, I've just haven't felt right. Sorry that I just kinda change topics quickly, I don't know how to make this flow. 
Anyways for the past two months, I've been struggling to sleep. It takes me forever to sleep, at one point I would sometimes take NyQuil to sleep but then I moved onto melatonin and that hasn't worked for me. Once I can sleep, I just wake up a few couple hours later. I don't know why, I just have these unrelated random nightmares almost daily. I wake up with my heart pounding. I'm terrified of sleeping but I desperately want too. Although it's the hallucinations that really scare me too. Sometimes it gets so bad that I'm terrified to sleep without the lights on. I feel like I'm constantly being watched and I just see these eyes that appear for a second then disappear. Or these creature that just watch me. Sometimes I can feel them touching me. Although it's much worse at night, I still see these things in the day, I'm just so paranoid and afraid. It's just so tiring and I don't know how much longer I can keep up with this. 
Although there is also one more thing that bothers me, I also feel like I'm distant from my body. I can't recognize myself anymore, I spend hours just stating at my hands or at the mirror thinking whether or not I truly exist. I know I exist but it really feels like it doesn't, like I'm just watching a movie of someone else's life. I've always felt so fake. I can't emotionally bond with anyone, I have friends but at the end of the day, I just don't care about them. I feel really bad that I just can't truly care about them, if they left me, I would be unaffected. I don't know why I just can't feel anything for anyone. Although I can feel real emotions towards my boyfriend which I find to be an absolute miracle that I can actually feel. I truly care about him but I just don't know why I can't feel the same for others. I just don't why I've been feeling like this for so long.
I want to see a therapist but I'm afraid that my mother will overreact. Especially when it comes to these matters, she has always overreacted and have gotten so angry with me. She says things such as I'm crazy and that she's going to sent me to a mental hospital or that I'm a spoiled brat because ""nothing bad"" has happened to me. That because she went through worse just shows how weak and how much of a crybaby I am. I just can't take it anymore. Everyday just feels worse and worse. I'm so afraid of everything but I want to become better, I want to become better because of my boyfriend. He is truly so caring and supportive of me, he puts up with my panic attacks or my breakdowns and every time he always says that he'll stay with me and support me the best that he can. Although I don't want to become such a huge burden on him when we're older, I really feel like if I put my efforts into therapy, I could really learn to cope and become healthier mentally. I could also become much better at supporting him as well since he really means the world to me but we both agreed that I need help. 
Sorry for the rant but thanks for taking a moment out of your day to read this. I also apologize for any grammar mistakes I may have made. But, any advice about how I could have a discussion with my mother about me seeing a therapist without having her become so angry with me? ",13Jan2019,1

46,"Late last year I decided to further my studies. I did that out of my own decision of wanting to upgrade myself. I was hyped up the beginning of the semester. But soon after, everything went downhill, I didn’t attend classes. I performed very poorly in class,  I stayed locked in house and became a hermit. Not studying, not socializing, just laying there on the sofa bed day in and day out. But I managed to drag myself out of it once in awhile to attend some classes and to do little assignments. I didn’t feel anything, I just feel empty, no desire, no drive, just devoid of emotions and spirit. Fast forward to today, I lose interest in everything, even studies, food and socializing but I did manage to do what is expected of me for my studies. But I think I might fail my last paper, and I haven’t the slightest care about whether I pass or not. And now it’s been weeks, I haven’t eaten proper food, haven’t had proper rest. I survived on cereals, occasional bread and hot choc. Although my body is demanding for more, but I just let it be. I waited until the pang of hunger goes away while laying on the sofa bed and continued to just stare at the wall. I want to drag myself out of it but I don’t want to drag myself out of it.

47,"I’m super empathetic and feel everything that happens around me as if it were happening to me directly. I hate it so much, it causes me so much heartache and suffering. 

I know there’s no on/off switch but I need to learn how to turn it down of distance myself from things. I’m a complete mess at the moment because of the passing of a friend of someone close to me. I can feel her hurting, the families hurting, I can feel that gut wrenching feeling of realising of never seeing that person again. It floods me at random times and I can’t deal with it any more.

I haven't been able to figure out if it means that I don't have schizophrenia because I am unable to say it mentally I've been looking for a cure for this for so long if someone could please help me.

53,It repeats in the back of my head reminding me why I find speaking useless. Misunderstandings and assumptions. People rarely listen. And if they do it’s only to reply. No one hears me. And if they do they hear me talking but don’t comprehend what I say. I’m alone in this. I’ve always been alone. I just can’t believe I went this long thinking my words held weight. Words mean nothing. Intentions mean nothing. Actions mean nothing. Nothing I do means anything. I’m here learning to bite my tongue and strangle my throat. Not another word will escape to explain the anguish I feel. These thoughts are poison and I’ve no one to rely on. I don’t dissuade anyone anymore. Let them think what they like. Clearly their minds are made up. It’s the same old thing. Quiet and quieter until I think no more.,13Jan2019,1
54,"So I’ve struggled with my mental health since I was a teen. I dropped out of High School because of Anxiety (Thankfully, I went back and finished later on in life). I am no stranger to seeking help from professionals and when I began feeling this incredible hopelessness I decided it was time to start seeing a therapist. Our conversation began with me admitting I feel “stuck” in life and have so far been unable to make changes. After a couple month of reliving the past without really finding any “reason” for why it would lead to me feeling the way I do now, I decided it was time to pursue medication for the first time to help me handle whatever the hell I’m dealing with. 

Next doctor was a family doctor at a lovely LGBTQ clinic in the city I live. For the first time ever, I felt like my doctor was listening and understanding me. He was due to retire in a couple months and I felt lucky that I had met him before his time as a doctor was up. I ended up having to go back a couple times so we could chat/do blood tests/ determine the right course of action. He was very honest that he had not had enough experience with mental health issues and so referred me to the specialist in my city for a “psych analysis” to confirm his diagnoses of Moderate Depression, Social Anxiety, and an Eating Disorder. In the meantime, he casually suggested smoking pot to temporarily treat the way I had been feeling. I’ve smoked weed since I was a young teen so the idea was not too shocking ... especially seeing as weed was to be legalized in Canada the following week!

Fast forward 3 months and here I am wide awake at 2:46 am sharing my experience because I’m out of pot and thusly overthinking everything. I just want time to just fly the f^$% by in a dazed high so I can finally meet with someone and get this under control. I still have another month of waiting for my appointment and it’s proven much harder the past couple month knowing /hoping what my life might be like after I’ve been seen by these new doctors. When I’m high things are manageable... but when I’m sober ... nearly unbearable. I’ve progressed to the point of walking around and noticing hard objects like a table leg and thinking to myself “If only I could slip and hit my head on that.” I feel like I’m in a race to see who’s going to get to me first? Mental breakdown or medical attention!?

Anyway, anyone else find themselves in a similar situation? I know I just have to wait a couple more weeks but it feels like a lifetime away. 

P.S : I got in contact with my therapist to do some “maintenance venting” until my appointment date is here so I’m remaining in contact with my support system.

55,"I feel like there’s a black cloud over my head. Everyday - it’s looming. I need to do very precise things to not upset my equilibrium so that my mood doesn’t fall. I don’t think this is normal. I’ve always had mood swings but this has been happening lately.

I exercise at least once if not twice a day some days, I drink heaps of water, I get plenty of sun light, I try and think positively, I journal, I barely drink, I have many hobbies, I study things I’m interested in, I’m financially stable and am saving money, I get 8 hours of sleep every night, I hate my job but I love the stability, I have an amazing girlfriend who I love very much.

But, there’s a black cloud constantly hanging over my head. It strikes in the afternoons most days, when the sun sets. It strikes when I’m trying to sleep and I feel a weird abandoned feeling. I feel overwhelming grief all the time lately, and a heavy feeling in the pit of my stomach, I feel this strange feeling creeping up on me like I might just lose it and burst out crying any moment. Sometimes my girlfriend will be speaking to me and suddenly my mood shifts - and I’m depressed and I can’t feign excitement about anything. Even if I was just in the middle of doing something. 

I think I’m depressed.

56,"After close to a year [May 2017—March 2018] of mental health threatment, and collectively 4 months of inpatient treatment, I finally have reached a point of stability... or so I thought. I figured after almost a year of [March 2018—January 2019] of recovery, I was done with this garbage. Not so much.


I learned the difficult lesson that being numb isn't equivelant to being recovered. Realizing I was numb, as opposed to happy, really tapped into a dark spot of my mind. It triggered multiple layers of anxiety, depression, compulsions, hallucinations, sleep deprivation, etc. I can't get a decent night's sleep any more. I rapidly shift from numb to depressed. 


I finally realized something: maybe it never does get better in my case.",13Jan2019,1
57,"Never been the full ‘norm’ but there’s things that bother me greatly the older I’m becoming. (21F)

Instead of a long backstory, I’ll just jump to the ‘issues’ present today. (Some have always been present)


For some time now, well over a year, I’m having trouble staying connected to myself. I’ve mistaken imagination/dreams with memories since I was young but it seems like I can’t be wrong about that surely? I have been though.

I’m not implying I have some sort of split because I know that’s a lot different but I do seem to go through phases of different ‘versions’ of myself which makes things so much harder.. trying to summarise best I can.. quite often I just don’t feel connected to myself. My mind, my body and myself seem like different beings, I feel me and my mind are 2 not 1..

I’ve recently started working and while it’s simple enough, I have breakdowns out of nowhere and when I can feel it happening sometimes, can’t do anything to stop it, having a breakdown in the middle of dealing with customers isn’t great, which adds more pressure and makes everything worst. Luckily my employers dealt with this very kindly but I’m sure if it keeps happening, I’ll just get kicked in the sense that they’d feel it weren’t good for me to be in that industry.

I can’t switch off my mind either, I go home and constantly go through my entire day and conversations over and over, which stresses me out as I want to come home, chill and forget about my day, doesn’t happen.

I just don’t even know, I’m so out of touch with myself, I don’t know. I get so confused easily over the simplest of things, e.g. you could ask me to clean a window and I’ll get confused of how to clean it when I know deep down and it’s not that I worry cause believe it or not, there’s very little I give a shit about, I’ve been called a ‘hard hearted person’ many times especially since empathy isn’t really my thing either. On the other hand, I get distraught af and idek, when I have random thoughts in my head like, you ain’t spending enough time with mum, time could be up tomorrow and look at the lack of time you’ve spent, you’re gonna miss out, you’re gonna regret it and I get hella upset, it’s a little traumatic, my mum is my world, can’t explain.. 

I’m sick of forgetting everything, ask me to get a drink, I’ll turn around, take 2 steps and think, I’m sure I’ve been asked to do something.
I got the job to try giving normal life a good go and all but I just feel it’s knocked me off balance even more. I’m not a social person, I hate communicating with people 90% of the time, in work I deal with them 100% and it does kill me, to force a smile and conversation being all customer friendly, it makes me die inside.

My day has to be closest to how I imagine it should, if it doesn’t, it gets me overwhelmed and I can’t cope. The smallest thing can knock me off and change my mood completely.

I just don’t know what I’m meant to do, is this normal? Being dramatic? I’m being genuine though, I’m just stuck, I look at everyone and I feel the world is structured like robots and I’m just here on the wrong planet, I feel like I’m a lot different compared to most people, seeing everyone go to work, have food, watch tv, go to sleep etc, a lot of you do and it freaks me tf out.
Over the years, I’ve transformed into like 3 different people to get where I am now, all so different.
I can’t go on like this, I don’t have a clue about myself, I’m a contradiction, literally. I constantly feel one way then the full opposite.. I just wanna know what I can do, if there is a chance of me being more normal or something.

Other times I can feel rather superior compared to a lot of people, a slight feeling of entitlement(nothing ridiculous) etc, I contradict myself, who I am. everything


I was in the process of being assessed/diagnosed with BPD a few years back, but I moved and changed hospital etc, and they basically threw my case out saying that I was perfectly normal, regardless of what I went for, I still don’t feel normal but they wouldn’t listen. I don’t even think I have that, or anything majorly serious, but something isn’t right:/ so, again just a little help or guidance would mean the world to me rn.

58,"My partner has complex ptsd and generalized anxiety. Lately he has been getting fixated and small pains or when he is anxious he has been feeling really sick and thinking that the worst is happening to him.

59,"So I’ve had to see a psychiatrist for the past few years and was diagnosed with a disocial personality disorder. This really isn’t great because you then often get refused further treatment and they don’t often take everything you say seriously. It was going in circles and I got myself discharged three months ago, I don’t want to go back. 

Most nights I’ve been waking up at night to little noises, sometimes just whispering but sometimes it’s screaming and banging and a little harder to handle, it was only a few seconds at first but now it goes on for much longer. Last night I sprinted downstairs knife in hand to help my flatmate since I heard what sounded like a violent fight between him and his boyfriend, someone was clearly falling downstairs and there was screaming, smashing and banging. He was fast asleep, it was all in my head. 

I’m really struggling to figure out when I’m hearing something and when something is actually there. I can’t sleep anymore, I haven’t had a good nights sleep in a long time now. 

If anyone has much experience with auditory hallucinations and has any tactics they could share that would be much appreciated. It’s never properly coherent voices, mostly screaming. Constant screaming.

60,"Hopefully this is the right place for this. I'm going to try to keep this as brief as possible. My childhood was tough. My dad was a raging alcoholic and my mom wasn't a fantastic mom. My brother and I spent a lot of time with my grandparents. And both sides of my family spent alot of time feuding. And our family had issues with emotional stability. For my entire life. My dad got sober 13 years ago but before that if he would have continued he would.have been dead within months. My mom for some reason stayed with him that entire time. The trouble is my dad has made a full recovery and is helping addicts and is out counseling around the country and has attempted many times to get my mom to go with him but she doesn't do anything besides work and watch TV. He has since met another woman who is eager to be with him on his journey.  I'm 33 now my brother is 30 and we have a lot of repressed memories and emotions that we are working on these days. But the more that we talk about our lives and childhood the more we realize our mom had some weird habits of making things up or deterring us from doing things we wanted when we were younger.  She really doesn't want to face reality she makes things up from the past etc. I would love to get her the help she needs but when you talk about her and her issues she refuses to listen or crys and guilt trips us. Does anyone have a way to get her to understand she help dealing with the past?

61,"Not sure if ill actually find some help on here, though it’ll be welcome. This is more a vent of frustration. 

I’m an 18 y/o that’s always had some very minor insomnia, but a few weeks ago I watched a pretty scary “documentary” that has turned bedtime into a paranoia nightmare for me. 

I just cannot seem to stop thinking about it when I lay down to sleep, and sometimes I’ll freak myself out so bad that I’ll literally paralyze myself with fear and make myself unable to move.

62,"Hey guys, 

i am and 18 years old college student and I have very big depression for now over 5 months. It all started when my high school ended, about a month after that. I have various reason to be depressed, for example fucked up childhood. But my depression kicked in random. There was no explicit event or reason to be depressed. Everything was roughly the same for the last 3 years. So I thought about the reason for it and I saw some articles about depression and a routine in life. Than the idea came in my mind: After my school ended, my sleep patterns where all over the place. I mean during school time I would wake up everyday at the same time. I wasn't sleeping much because I was staying up too long every night but I woke up early and was tired so I could sleep easily the same night. For the last 5 months I was waking up everyday in different times. My college classes start late so I don't have to wake up early. I am also using too much eletronical devices which suppress melatonin and disturb the circadian rhythm further. Has anyone experience with this and can tell me how you affected this? ",13Jan2019,1
63,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this. Please respect. 

I spend 40-60% of my waking time daydreaming. I tend to think in bed too much that it interferes with my goals for the day. I do it on commute and pretty much every time I'm alone. Even a phrase in a book or a song triggers me to wander off, thinking about alternate futures and obsessing over mundane ideas. 

The only time I stop daydreaming is in early mornings when I haven't thought of anything yet or when I'm in a classroom, which is a fortunate thing. My days end with a speedy reel of images and random thoughts of no value which are quickly forgotten. 

When I try to communicate this to my friends, they think I'm joking or trying to be clever. I remember watching The Secret Life of Walter Mitty and thinking about how 'painfully honest' it was.

I'm past my teens now, and I would like to know how to get out of this slump. I get the notion that this is not normal or healthy. Or is it? 

I understand that a therapist might help, but until that option becomes viable for me, do you have any advice to control daydreaming? ",13Jan2019,1

65,"I’m 23, studied Finance in college, and now working for a Broker. Since I was 16, I have worked 6 jobs and have disliked them all, even when they were great for me.

I love being outside doing lawn work on my own, so my first job was landscaping, and having to do it on a routine everyday depressed me. I did it for a few months before I became a basket case. I then got a simple job as a grocery bagger during college for a great company with great coworkers, and even though I enjoyed it, I got depressed a month into it once the newness wore off. 

Post-college, I needed initial financial experience, so I just a job as a Universal Banker (bank teller, but also gave out small loans) and I loved it... at first. I felt like a finally had a job to take pride in and to focus on excelling in... but a month into it, it became routine/boring and I kept thinking “what now?” What is there to look forward to now. I ended up depressed for the next 9 months I worked there.

I got tired of doing that job and needed something new, so I started working as a financial analysis for a Broker-Dealer firm. I was so amped to get this job. I make excellent money for my age, and I get to be alone all day just listening to music and looking over data. The first few weeks were amazing. Now, I’m starting to get used to it after a month, and now my depression is coming back again.

Even though I have a great job that actually interests me, I just can’t stick to anything. I love stock trading on my personal time, but I can’t even enjoy it long for work. It just seems like I need something different everyday or I’ll go insane. 

I see my coworkers coming in everyday actually excited to tackle the day, and I have never been excited for a work day in my life. They come in with great moods and can actually see they are just “ok” with life. While halfway through day, EVERYDAY, I have a breakdown in the bathroom just because I want to be at home. It’s depressing thinking this is all I have to look forward to... especially since I feel that I have plateaued in life. Yea, I can make more money later and get a better position, but then what?   

I wish I was like the normal person that could just ignore emotions and just work. I’m already trying to figure out a plan on what to do next, even though most would kill for my current situation. I just feel like a basket case that can’t tough through life like most people. The thought of starting a new work week ALL OVER again has me so fucking stressed out. Like when does it end? I get my weekend just to have to work the next five days.

How do I stop this?",13Jan2019,1
66,"I'm not at an all-time low compared to previous time periods, but I'm still in bad shape.

I feel so alone and hopeless. I have a wonderful husband, but no one else. No friends and my family stresses me out worse. I've historically relied on an online support group, but things got ugly toward another member around thanksgiving. I saw so much gaslighting and bullying from people I'd trusted that I just quietly left. And I know I'll never trust that group again, but I find myself wanting to go back. Without those people I'm adrift.

And my husband is great. But no one's perfect and he really upset me the other day by the way he reacted to me having a self esteem episode. It was definitely not a recurring issue and he's apologised. We talked it out and are mostly okay, but my trust issues don't make it particularly possible to move on. I've started hiding my emotions from him a bit.

I'm lonely and I feel like a burden. I am a burden, objectively. I don't work (waiting on a decision from disability) and I don't help around the house. I have no energy and stress out too much over tiny things. So my husband does everything, including taking care of me when I have a flashback, panic attack, or suicidal spiral. I feel like I'm giving him nothing in return. I can barely listen to him talk about his day at work, because I start stressing about his problems, even the ones he doesn't really care about.

I'm a waste of space and energy and money. Like a black hole sucking in everything and giving nothing back. We don't even have a sex life anymore because my trauma history gets in the way. Any time we try I end up sobbing and panicky and he feels responsible. But he didn't't do anything wrong, it was my step dad. 

He's been dead more than a year now and it's not fair he's still torturing me. It's not fair that my family expects me to get over it. It's not fair that they talk about missing him to me. Especially my mom. I get it, she's a widow who lost her husband but she knows how he treated me. Just to be clear, I was an adult. My step dad was great, but then he changed after his stroke. And it went on for several years of helping my mom take care of him. He needed 24/7 supervision to stay safe. I'm expected to just brush it off because he was disabled both physically and mentally so he wasn't responsible for his actions. And he really wasn't coherent enough to understand, so I get it, but damn it he still tormented me for years. He crossed every line there is. And it's bullshit my mom thinks ""he didn't mean to hurt you"" is enough. Even if it's true it's not enough.

I'm never going to be okay. Everyone says it gets better. And I can see improvement, objectively. But I've been a useless mess of anxiety and depression for years. The meds aren't enough. The therapy isn't enough. My service dog isn't enough. What else can I even do? I still am always afraid and always hurting. I just want to die, but that would hurt my husband even more. But if not for that I really just am ready for it all to end.",13Jan2019,1

After cutting out smoking, dairy and trying things like eating slower but still having constant discomfort throughout my body I might have just realized that at least dairy wasn't the problem at all. 

Gluten intolerance is a real fucked up thing and even after seeing the gp for these symptoms and telling all healthcare professionals I came in contact with I had never thought that these might all be down to one simple thing. Removing gluten from my diet. This is definitely not what I wanted the solution to be as all my favorite foods contain gluten excluding cheese and chocolate but I'm hoping, after realizing that my mood dipped incredibly after eating a slice of toast for no reason and the fact that a vast majority of my diet is unfortunately just gluten, cutting this out my life could be one of the best things I've ever done for my physical, and much more importantly to me, my mental health.",13Jan2019,1

The girl (I’m just gonna use her/she) is dealing with anxiety (diagnosed) and depression (I’m pretty confident that it’s diagnosed). She also has symptoms, I think, of DID, but is not diagnosed (I’m just guessing and her therapists thinks so too, but she’s not diagnosed). She describes to me that she has trouble staying in touch with reality and other people. She cuts and eats way too little and then throws up pretty regularly. I’ve pushed her to try and talk to her therapist, but she maintains status quo because she’s afraid of her parents being told that she’s cutting and wants to kill herself.

76,"Need help/guidance determining where to get help on various topics/problems. any insights are appreciated as my life is a nightmare and has been for years. need help figuring out what might cause the following type of behaviors in my wife. dealing with Othello Syndrome (see wikiwand for good summary pathological jealousy ((extreme jealousy - she believes I am cheating on her, despite information that contradicts this.) trying to get her to a neuropsychologist for diagnosis, 6 month lead time. Her mental health dr. has made things nothing but worse constantly changing her meds around, and by PUTTING her on meds that CAUSE the disease in the first place.

This disease seems centered with dopamine receptor d3 - the best paper I can find is the pmc3144984 on the ncbi nlm nih gov site . I am avoiding links as a new user as per the banning warning as I wanted to get feedback as soon as possible.

Things used to be very different, but now after spending all day, she is again my best friend and lover.. until late at night.. then it is like she turns into a different person.. agitated, ruthless verbally, she says she is hurt by this cheating - but I don't see sadness .. it is anger.my questions really go to: Late at night is when things go really wrong. I say controlled rage below - she basically from a sound decides she wants a divorce, doesn't trust me at all.. and she treats me like dog $hit.

She says she hears 'clicking' - it triggers a controlled rage response ( misophonia ?) (she believes this is sound from 'device' used to talk to girls.. she says my lips look distorted. It is like she is fast cycling every evening - bipolar? I am so out of my element, but know that I am doing no wrong and want to get her the help she needs.

The problem is she came from an abusive relationship, and she likes to use that against me as well.. she transfers the prior relationship to this one - meaning she threatens me verbally, then threatens to use against me. that part puts me in danger and I can't have that.

Last night this controlled rage response happened without the clicking.. supposedly. I can't get her / her phycologist to even listen to my perspective - she refuses to listen. My wife has her Dr. convinced I am cheating.. my wife filters all the information and keeps control. the strange thing is after hours of work, I can get back the intense soul-mate level relationship we had for decades. It is hell on me, I am getting so little sleep.

Yes, the easy answer is to leave, but if I do it now, I will likely end up in a very bad position. at least now she agreed to see a neuropsychologist, is getting a head CT, and is believing enough to get diagnosed and maybe get on the right meds.

I cannot resist biting it  if I don't remove the new grown part it with a tool. 

I'm not sure if I have dermatophagia, but I'd say I'm very stressed. Dealt with suicidal thoughts and had (slightly) cut myself before.

I have never told anybody and my parents always told me its just a bad habit. Should I go see a therapist for help? And I sure doesn't want my parents to be involved/know about this. Or should I tell them to take me to a therapist? I'm sure I cannot afford having an appointment.

i keep deleting and re-writing this. the worst part is, i don't feel sad, i don't feel upset.. i just don't care. I've read a few posts on here and i feel if i can get into it, it'll help me as i don't keep a diary or notes or anything.  there's no structure to this post but i'm just going for it, i'm not thinking story mode - and i'm sorry but it might be quite long, but whether people choose to read it - whatever. 

it started when i got raped at my uncles wedding by the brides best friends son, and ofc if you aren't beaten black and blue, people choose to ignore it. even at 11yo i found it easier to brush it under the carpet rather than address the situation and i'm sat here at 22yo in the same position. i mean, people know but i never did anything about it - which again, makes people not believe you. 

since i i assumed that's what guys wanted from 13yo i was putting out. i assumed that's what i had to do to get them to like me and obviously word gets around. i got onto drugs and drinking, smoking and whatever else, but i got over it eventually at 17yo and decided that all the drugs needed to stop. i still smoke weed, fags and drink booze but the hard drugs stopped, and i felt great that i managed to boot all of that but now im STILL sat here like craving it. maybe it never goes away? 

i aways felt maybe a blog or something might help but you always assume noone wants to hear it because thats sort of the whole vibe ive had my whole life. nobodys really that interested. i enjoy typing and id quite like it if people reached out and i could maybe help them.. idk . i just knew that when i was 14+ years id of loved it if i could just write to someone who i knew would reply from an outsiders point of view because i live in a very very small town so as you can imagine theres not much you can say or do without people finding out. even if you only trust your closest friends.

I now how to spend the next two hours with her in the room I’ve been staying in at the hospital. The door has to be open at all times (it’s part of my observation level) and she’s currently having loud conversations with everyone in the corridor. I just want to relax and have some quiet in the room I’ve been given but she won’t stop. And it makes me sick to hear her voice, she has been cruel to me so many tines. 

I feel like I have no privacy in my own room and nowhere to relax and have some peace. I understand that someone has to be with me and that person can get bored but I just really don’t want her near me right now and I feel like I’m part of a social situation when the door is open, everyone can see me and people are talking in the doorway. It’s too draining. ",13Jan2019,1
100,"As I said in the title, I don't think I'm depressed but I feel suicidal. Quite often I get thoughts of shooting myself and sometimes other methods of suicide, they involve a slow, painful death, like shooting myself in the stomach and bleeding out. I want to do it, but I don't know why, If I wasn't scared of what kind of pain I would experience I would do it (i want more of a deep aching pain than a sharp extreme pain). I don't really feel depressed, that being said I do feel like I have muted emotions, but people say I'm actually quite an emotional and empathetic person, I don't try to fake it. Like I won't feel an emotion but I'll do everything as if I had that emotion, if that makes sense. That's really the only explanation I have for suicidal thoughts, I'm depressed or sad but don't realize I am. I do have energy, in fact since they've started I've had better coordination (probably due to unrelated things, mostly increased self confidence), I've been able to better on tests, better at talking to people, etc. I've been fascinated with my own suicide for about 2 or 3 months now. I'm scared I might actually do something. My reasoning behind is more ""i want to know what it feels like, and not having to deal with life anymore would be alright."" What am I feeling, what should I do about it?

I get panic attacks where my reality is moving so fast where I have to move into a corner and sensory overload and do not have any control about any thing but freaking out.  I use breathing exercises but some times it does take over!.  

I have been to a hospital a few times by EMS because I was over loaded and it would not stop. And moving from where is not possible.

104,"honestly i don't even know what bullshit i'm talking about but something in my head and i don't know what and i'm trying to figure it out is preventing me from being happy. it's bullshit, it's frustrating. what the hell is it, I've never been abused, i'm in a good relationship, never bullied, anything. i don't understand why i get suicidal thoughts, i don't understand why i find the idea of harming myself pleasant. i don't even know when i experience something whether it's enjoyable or not. i watch a movie and in my head i just don't know whether i liked it or not, i get the same enjoyment out of starting at a wall for 10 hours as i do doing anything else. i don't know what i feel but i don't feel happiness, it's like theres some turbulent feelings but i don't know what they are or why they exist. literally though, i get my shit taken, i don't care, when people die i don't miss them. if i mess up really bad i can accept full responsibility but i won't feel sorry about what i did, and i will work to fix my mistake materially (i want to but i don't understand how to fix a mistake emotionally). i don't know why but i can't keep on like this i can't focus in school, i can't understand when people speak, my mind just wanders from one thing to the other and like i said it's just as interesting for me to stare at a wall as it is to do something or talk to someone so i think my brain just naturally doesn't put the effort into something it deems as unimportant. if i try hard enough i can understand and focus, but it's just mentally straining and not rewarding. if i the choice i'd rather stare at a wall all day than do stuff. maybe i am depressed, but if i am i've been depressed my entire life because I've felt like this my entire life as long as i can remember. when i think about suicide, i usually think that i want to feel the pain, i want to feel some kind of strong feeling, even if it's a negative one, control i guess. i can have normal interactions with people and in fact i find a lot of the time people want to be my friend, but i don't care about that stuff, i don't care about anything. I've searched, I've tried sports, gone to various events, consumed as much information, gone on a bunch of vacations, even tried cannabis, none of it made me feel any different than i always do, cannabis surprised me since i assumed it would make me feel happy or elated, it just made me feel disconnected but i was still bored, nothing was funny or interesting, i've tried it a couple times and it's the same thing, sometimes i take too much and i do feel bad, but more like a weight on my heart and my brain is slowed, not a paranoid feeling. what is this, how do i go back to feeling normal emotions. i've tried everything, i watch inspirational videos, try to have an active social life, do school events, etc, but it's all so uninteresting, i can't even do any of it well because i can't focus on it enough, i just stare off into space thinking about nothing because it has the same level interest but i use less energy. i'm thinking about dying, there's no point, even though i don't really feel sad i don't think i'll ever really feel fulfilled or happy per say",13Jan2019,1

But now everyone wants me to start a new medication and I just can’t get the courage to take it

111,"I want to state right off from the start: I have no idea what I'm writing. I have no end-goal with writing this,I just want to vent to someone. Thank you in advance for reading. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have had this unshakable feeling of anxiety and pressure constantly for the last 2-3 years. It's best to start with the fact that I spent most of my time closed off in my flat, that is in my room which is kept constantly dark other than this laptop I'm writing on. I love social interaction,I WANT to have social interaction, but every time I do have a good time with someone,I can't do it again for a long amount of time because I feel like it'll be too much. I'm too scared to speak to anyone, even if I'm having a big problem, I'll just feel like I'm embarrassing myself and they'll hate me for anything I say.

&amp;#x200B;

It's totally confusing to me. There's no reason for me to be like this, I grew up with a loving family, mostly my mother (my father has never lived with us) and I've had friends during my childhood. Even today I have a small group of 'friends' , but every time I try to get help from them I'm straight up denied and laughed at. I've thought of harming myself before , but I'm too much of a bitch to take the pain. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next I want to talk about how easily my pressure spikes and how easily irritated I am. Even someone speaking in a relatively quiet environment will make me irritated to the point where I want to beat the shit out of them. I've lashed out at inanimate objects before (I've thrown chairs across the room,broke my lamp,phone etc. ) and I'm scared, more for others than myself, that one day I'll just break and hurt somebody when I can't take anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I've become the absolute opposite of myself, I've always been a nice person who's always up to help in any way,but on the other side I'm violent and hateful. I feel like I have 2 personalities that are polar opposites, though I've never been diagnosed with any disorder.

&amp;#x200B;

To weave onto the last sentence: I've never even been to counseling. I'm too scared. For one, I don't want my family finding out about my problems because I think they won't love me like they used to and that'd kill me. Second, I'm too scared to interact with a counselor, I don't know how to express my feelings well enough for anyone to understand me, even if they tried their best. Third, I'm scared that I may come off as too violent and be considered almost too dangerous and be isolated even further if anyone found out.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

All I've ever wanted in my life was a friend or someone to love,which I've never had. Every attempt to connect with someone failed,and it's all my fault. It's not that I cannot connect to people,I absolutely can,but I cannot do it when facing them. I love some things with all my heart: games,space,music and I'm passionate about all of it, but even if someone too likes those things I just CANNOT connect to them because I'm scared of letting them down or making them angry and I hate myself for it all. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I've tried everything I can do alone: I took to exercising to fix my looks, I spoke to people and went out a lot, but nothing of it worked permanently. Nothing makes me feel happy in my life anymore and I don't know how to continue anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I've bottled everything up in myself, all my violence and hate, I've put all responsibility on myself and I covered it up with a goofy-ass personality so people think I'm joking even when I'm sending signals that I want help and, even when I'm absolutely 100% serious, everyone writes it off.

113,"Hi,

Long story short, the suffering started two years ago in January 2017 about these days. And I remember how it struck me and I was in shock that I'd be facing all these weird and stupid thoughts I never thought would even occur. 

I did used to have a slightly OCD manner before that but it got WORST after that event. Months went by, I learnt tricks to prevent all these thoughts from entering. Like for example, I wouldn't do something until I have a positive thought or image in my mind beforehand. It was like an obligatory act. Otherwise, I thought I'm stupid or dumb!

I know this is already sounding weird and dumb, but it's the reality. Time went on, and I learnt to block these stupid thoughts, like mainly acting NATURAL and that really helped me. And what also helped me alot was, that I thought to myself, why won't I think about the days I wasn't like this at all? I was fine then!? Nothing ate me! So that encouraged me to throw these thoughts and images out the window. 2017 had been a year of trials and tribulations for me. And for 2018, it slightly got better as I mentioned. And now for the pasted few months, thanks God, I am coping very well. 

However, whenever I do fear something the most, and that appears for too long, I do fight it for a while, few hours, the I'm good again. Mostly anxiety and OCD when you are imprisoned by your brain to think like so and so. You feel it cringed and compressed. Until you rationalise it. That's another worst part.

There are times when I'm all clean and natural, I do something, it goes fine, but slowly if I do fear a thought or an image, it would just come in mind making me do something several times until done without such a thought or Image (naturally) (and also I hope you know what I mean by 'something')

Please help me out!

Thanks all in advanced",13Jan2019,1

but the problem is i have been told schizophrenia is constant with the sufferer always believing in the delusions and hallucinations whereas i slip into periods from a few hours to a few days to sometimes a week or more where i go through this. the audio hallucinations are fairly constant if i don't keep myself focused on something but the more severe stuff comes to me in bouts where i will fall into one of these periods and lock myself away from people for a few days until it starts to go away and i don't believe people are trying to poison my food with plutonium (until yesterday i legitimately was sure of this from friday so i didn't eat) so is it likely something else or have i got a misconception.

For example, this morning my mom told me she was going to braid my hair, and told me to take the tangles out. I wasn’t able to take out all the tangles because I didn’t have a mirror, and she told me I didn’t need one. Then, she started to tell me that I’m so dumb I can’t even take the tangles out of my hair. Then, she started to tell me that I’m going to struggle all my life and she wasn’t going to help me if I need her and completely abandon me. My mom told me I was going to be nothing in life. She began to dig the comb into my scalp, and it hurt. I asked her why she was doing that, and she hit me on the head and called me fat sh*t. Moving on to my Dad. He’s just completely abusive.

I’m usually the one who tries to protect my brother and sister. My dad even cusses at us and tells us we are useless and garbage. To be honest, I’m so used to the verbal abuse and name calling from him, it only sometimes affects me. Moving on to my brother and sister. My mom and dad started to telling my brother and sister to call me names. My sister is three years younger than me, and my brother is six years younger than me. They just completely hate me for no reason when I love them whole heartedly. They verbally and physically abuse me just like my parents. I just don’t know what I did to deserve all this.

118,"First of all I'd like to mention that I'm not from an English-speaking country so my message may contain some mistakes. 
Perhaps I will not torment and go straight to the point. Back in April, I assume that due to stress, I started having problems with memory, attention, concentration .. I sometimes perceived dreams as real memories, there were false memories, it was difficult to memorize information. The details were also difficult to remember.
Now I seem to be divided into two parts. One is me, who is a funny, slightly naive and kind friend, who is still experiencing certain problems with concentration. The other part is me, which is impartial, with a narrow spectrum of emotions, but with a good concentration and observation of people. In this state, I am collected, self-confident and can stand up for myself, but at the same time, due to these qualities and directness, I can seem hostile to others. I become, in the literal sense of the word, a different person with different world views and interests. I noticed that I was becoming so because of emotional stress. Like some kind of defense mechanism ...
I don’t know if the fact that sometimes I have memory gaps will be useful. Not for long .. for example, I go home from school and half the way I don’t remember how I walked. As if working automatically. There were also strange feelings of alienation from reality, in which I could not understand who I was and what I was doing in this world ...

120,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering what exactly the issue here is. Hopefully y'all can provide some insight.

&amp;#x200B;

I am deciding to make this post after eating dinner with my family. Throughout the whole meal, I was too afraid to talk / add to the conversation. My family were chit chatting with one another, but when someone started to tell a story, I got very uneasy that somehow they might start to get nervous (like I would). While this was happening, I also thought to myself, wow, I would never be tell a story without shitting myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Towards the end of the meal, someone asked me a question. I immediately begin to panic, but luckily it could be answered with just a one word reply. I answered awkwardly; mumbling and clenching my toes.

&amp;#x200B;

This is just one example of many awkward feelings and interactions I have. In work, whenever we have a meeting, I feeling like running out of the room before its my turn to speak. When it is my turn to speak, on a good day I can get by ok, but as soon as someone has a question, I begin to get very nervous and cannot articulate myself very well. Which leads to a poor meeting, as I cannot communicate properly, we cannot properly sort out any issues at hand.

&amp;#x200B;

On the train to and from work, I cannot sit down and relax without thinking people are looking at me. I am always dreading that I bump into someone that I know, because I would be way too awkward and might even have a panic attack if someone started talking to me with so many other people in close proximity. I can only put my head down and look at my phone as I travel.

&amp;#x200B;

When I go out to restaurants, I get very nervous when the waiter comes to take my order. When I go to the bar, I can barely order a drink.

1- I sit down, and I pour my heart out to this woman. It took everything I had to open up this much and to feel that vulnerable. I feel like she gave me some decent insight about some of my thinking progress, but nothing to deep or anything that I had not acknowledged myself. 

Then literally, 45 minutes after our session ends. This woman puts out her iPhone with her Square card reader and asks how I will be paying. What the absolute fuck?. First, I'm a fierce proponent of Capitalism and paying people for their time and effort. But, Jesus fucking Christ, Lady. Is there a more tactful way to do this? I felt dirty, I felt how one would feel after visiting a prostitute and realizing they have no love or understanding for you, they just want your money.  Send me a bill, or refer me to your receptionist, wait 5 more minutes before bringing the subject of payment up. My god. This left a sour taste, and I decided I was not going back.

2- I make another appointment with a therapist who is also a Psychiatrist. Again, I spend a grueling hour holding back tears as I tell her what the fuck is wrong with me. Every single session is a constant drain of my energy and emotional well begin, never mind the strength it takes to open up your darkest and most vulnerable thoughts to a complete new stranger which you have never seen in your life.

124,"So I’ve got this slight paranoia that my ex that I broke up with may become a stalker or obsessive. 
So long story short, he seems to have a lot of trust issues and tied in with that he has communication issues especially when confronted with conflicts regarding our relationship. He doesn’t try to make things work but claims that he wants it to work out. He doesn’t put in the work and no matter who is at fault from an argument, I always found myself in the position trying to fix what’s broken. Even when he is the huge reason/problem. He doesn’t give. He shows signs that he doesn’t trust me when I haven’t given him reasons to. I just don’t get trusted for nothing. Anyway, we have been broken up for months now and he constantly reaches out to me trying to be friendly. I finally gave in and responded back to him and allowed him a chance to be friends. He says that he really wants to be friends and I wasn’t ready for it yet but he convinced me to give him a chance. So i gave him a chance and we got into yet another conflict where he shuts down and doesn’t play his part in mending. 
I feel like if he is the one that wanted this friendship he should be putting way more effort into it. 
With history of his behaviors and him not putting in enough effort but requesting we have a cordial relationship, I feel a bit paranoid that he could be a threat to my safety in the future. I’ve decided after our final conflict, that I am seriously done with him and not interested in mending a friendship. I told him I don’t hate him, he should leave me alone moving forward and I don’t want to ever be in contact with him. I’m not well experienced in dumping people so a part of me feels guilty for being the dumper and having to say all those things. But to be honest, that’s how I feel because he doesn’t serve any good purpose in my life, he aggravated me and exhausts me every time I try to make it work with him. It’s really irritating and I can not do it anymore.  He doesn’t talk about his issues that he has since we broke up and doesn’t show signs that he truly wants a friendship with me. He just wastes my time consistently. 
So my concern is, he knows where I live, still has photos of me (he told me this during our attempt to be friends post breakup) I feel uncomfortable about that. But the good thing is, we don’t have any mutual friends and I’ve blocked all means of contact and social media from him. Logically, he shouldn’t be able to contact me but I’m concerned that he could lash out from me leaving him. 
How do I deal with this paranoia because obviously not everyone thinks their exes become psychos at the end of every relationship.

126,I am 26 year old female and I am afraid of being in a relationship. I suffer from depression and anxiety and have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder  and anxiety . This is not something I   openly discuss and is confined to my immediate family as it is still seen as a stigma in the society I live in . I’m scared of being in a relationship for two reasons one because I feel like my mental health struggles would be overwhelming for my potential partner and secondly I’m scared to open up to a person and  be vulnerable as I feel they wouldn’t want to be with me if they find out about me suffering from depression (like I said before it still seen a  major stigma in the small Indian community I come from). I am at an age where both society’s pressure of marriage and my own longing of finding a soulmate makes me want to give being in a relationship a try but my fear of getting hurt is stopping me . I have on numerous occasions just pushed people away before any sort of relationship could start because of my fear of getting hurt . Any advise would be much appreciated.

127,"Hi friends, I have decided to finally find a therapist after years of hemming and hawing, now that I finally have my own insurance. 

I'm pretty scared to do so, because when I imagine the search, I imagine a series of misadventures in which I get shuffled from doctor to doctor, pawned off to group therapy when I need a one on one and so on, and some endless struggle to find someone to actually hear me and help me find what I need.

How should I begin this search? What kind of answers should I have prepared? 

In general I'm not confident in how I would answer the question ""why are you seeking therapy?"" because while I have a few specific issues I want to discuss, even moreso I just have a jumbled mess in my brain that I don't know how to start explaining and I need someone to help me sort it out.

128,"I constantly feel like I'm looking through a window or tv (dissociating). I often feel really sad or numb. My anxiety is constant with triggers that cause full blown panic attacks. When I'm anxious, I sometimes pick, or scratch when it's really bad. I feel like I ruin things and am afraid of losing people. (Seperation and abandonment issues). I never feel like I'm content with anything I do, rather I feel like I'm going through the motions. My mother and sister both have borderline personality disorder and it terrifies me to think that I may have that. (I'm estranged from both of those people.) I have trouble focusing or staying attentive to one thing. I have a habit of starting many small things and never finishing them. Sometimes I cant shower simply because I never have the motivation for it. I feel like i never have the motivation for anything to be honest.

TRIGGER WARNING (the following is a semi-detailed description of child rape)

&gt;!I was 6 years old. Wearing a knee length, emerald green velvet dress with a white collar and built in white petticoat.!&lt;

&gt;!Innocently walking up the stairs to suggest to my older brother that we play a game.!&lt;

&gt;!He was in the bath at the time but had told me to come in anyway. !&lt;

&gt;!wondering what adventure he had in mind.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!When he got out of the bath he came in just wearing a towel, he saw that I was in the bed and asked!&lt;

&gt;!""Did you take your knickers off?"" with a look that made my skin crawl. !&lt;

&gt;!I managed a small nod in response. He let the towel fall and climbed into the bed positioning himself between my legs,!&lt;

&gt;!his hands holding my wrists above my head.!&lt;

&gt;!With no words of explanation or warning he inserted his penis into my vagina.!&lt;

&gt;!I winced at the pain and looked up at him, in one sickening look he told me everything I needed to know-!&lt;

130,"Hi, im posting this today ti see if anyone cqn relate with me or even provide me with some helpful advice. My story starts off when I was 13 I was fairly overweight, and weighed around 240lbs for me height. I dealt with a mentally abusive father who degraded me for years, and I know many people have had much worse experiences than myself. I was always told Id never amount to anything, I was fat, useless, you name it. I evevtually told myself Id lose weight go get him off my back. Over the period of about a year and 2 months later I lost over 120lbs. And at this time I found a great love for fitness. I chased this for years and I still do today and im now 22. I got largely invested into bodybuilding through out highschool and I was always known as  the big guy and lifting weights was my escape I suppose. I took upon training fellow students and friends and found fun this but no matter how strong, big, or inshape I was I was just never mentally happy or physically happy. I always wanted more, meanwhile I had my dad telling me I was too muscualr or I worked out too much which is totally contradictory to what he told me before I got into fitness. Fast foward, to this point in my life, Im 22 and out of highdchool for 2 years at this point. I was fortunate to find a job outside of highschool which Im no longer at but Im at a better place. Ive been with my bank for nearly 2 years now. I started as a teller and wanted to evetually become a financial advisor because as  child I always saw the people in banks with offices and nice clothing and wanted to be like them. I started part time, hustled, became full-time, kept on hustling became the lead teller, vault and atm teller. And as of december I made it to my financial adviosr position. Im entirely fortunate to have an awesome set of co-workers who support me, I love my management and my co-workers unlike any other work family ive had. And im fortunate to have moved through posistions to quickly and get to where I wanted to be. I persoanlly feel that I make grest money for a 22 year old, and I drive one of my dream cars already. Where my unhappiness comes into play is it seems im just empty. I get my car and its not enough, im not satusfied and I want more or something to curb that want. I get my job that Ive wanted since I was a kid, and I love it but I dont really feel to happy about it. Its like no matter what I do I feel empty and it seems like theres a void in my that needs to be filled. I always feel petty to talk with myself about these things. And I feel that Ive done good for myself, but I just dont value it like I feel I should. I cant express excitement for getting the job or the car I wanted. I cant show excitement about my sister, having gave birth to a beautiful daughter, and I feel so disgusting because I feel like such an empty emotionless person. Most people would generally describe me as a happy fun uplifting person. And I typically am, I get more enjoyment out of making others happy and wish I could find that happiness that I can distill in others and find it for myself. I just want to somehow come to terms with myself that I need to be thankful for all I have and be satusfied because my ways are mentally destructive. And I wish I could find whats missing in me so I dont feel like such a dead person, who doesnt get excited about birthdays, get togethers, new children to the family. And I have deslt with strong depression and anxiety from a young age and take some medicines but they never seem to fully help it just masks the problem. If theres anyone out there who takes the time to read all of this im thankfuk for you. And if you have any advice or help at all I greatly appreciate it. Thank you😔 ",13Jan2019,1

TLDR: Advice on getting back to life after getting out of the hospital. What I should expect in the future. Should I tell my employer the real reason I was in the hospital? Thank you. 

I just got out of a mandatory 72-hour hold on Friday. I can't afford to take time off work and am expected to return on Monday ""I have a commission based income"". My husband has gotten more time off work than I have to recover. I overdosed on medication and am pretty much symptom free. My major concern is I feel pretty apathetic about my attempt. I feel like I should be more upset. I've lived with anxiety and ptsd for many years. I finally just snapped. The worst thing is I'm no longer allowed to have fire arms which sucks because my one of favorite hobbies is long range shooting. 

Anyway, back to the original question how am I supposed to return to life? I'm afraid I'm going to end up crumbling because I didn't get the opportunity to process what I went through. Isn't moving on this quickly a form of repression? I have an appointment with a therapist in a few days, and they raised up my antidepressants to the maximum dose. So in the meantime I'm very confused about my emotions. Is it healthy to move on like this? Is it a good sign that I can function so highly or should I be more concerned with how empty I feel about it? My husband doesn't seem phased in the slightest and is going about his business as normal I'm worried he is just repressing to. Any advice ? Or should I just continue to pretend like nothing has happened. Sorry for the rant I just can't really talk to anyone about this.

135,"I was meant to be going travelling with my best friend from uni in April and she's told me today she doesn't want to go with me because of my mental health (depression and anxiety - which are under control atm) due to the responsibility of it. We  then spoke on the phone about it and she's now going to think about it and re-discuss next week. I don't think i would go to SEA by myself. I have been looking forward to this for such a long time :(

Second bit of bad news was that when receiving the rota for my job next week I've been given no shifts and don't know if I've lost my job. Still waiting for a reply from my manager on why I have no shifts. I know january is very quiet there (in a restaurant) but why am I the only person with 0 shifts ???

Third thing is that the guy i was talking to who works where i work (slept with last week and was gonna go to his again next week) has not replied for most of today which is very odd

138,"I’ve been dealing with all consuming anxiety ever since I can remember which has led to several bouts of severe depression throughout the years. I saw a therapist for years and have many learned skills for coping but all rationality has gone out the window with this recent breakup.

I went through a breakup three years ago from a relationship that was toxic on both sides. I let it break me and I had to take time off from school (university) to get myself back together. Now after everything, I’m expected to graduate in May and have found myself in the same situation I was in before. However, this time it was a healthy (or so I thought) year and a half long relationship until the shit show that was the end. I’ve never felt more betrayed, naive, angry, taken for granted (insert all negative emotions here). All this hurt and pain is consuming me. 

I’m terrified for what is to come and don’t want to let myself spiral like I did last time, but I know I will if I’m not proactive.

139,"I need to get this out. I’m going to write all the times in my life I’ve been sexually abused that I can remember. 
The first one is a bit of a blurry mess. To be honest im not 100% sure what happened and I don’t even know who it was for sure. When I was around 4-5 I started showing signs of having been sexually abused. I told my mum I was having nightmares about her boyfriends private parts. I constantly spoke about private parts and sex and I knew way too much for my age. I was asked my social work let’s if anything happened to me but i always said no because I couldn’t remember anything having happened. To this day I don’t know what happened but I still feel sick when I think about it and sometimes when someone holds my head or puts something in my mouth or I’m having oral sex with my boyfriend I get a weird heavy feeling in the pit of my stomach. 
The next two are both when I was about 6-7. 
One was my cousin who kept taking me into my mums room when he came to our house. He would get his little penis out and ask me if I thought it was big and make me touch it. One day I went and told on him for being gross and my mum never let him take me anywhere alone again. Nothing else happened. 
The other one was Andrew, a 14 year old boy who went to the same school as me for mental struggling children. He wasn’t stupid or anything but he clearly had autism or something, he was a little odd and had tantrums a lot. One day he came to my house. I don’t know how he knew where I lived but he showed up when me and My sister who was a year younger than me were playing outside. He wanted us to come play with him so we did. We were very stupid girls and we used to sneak away from our street a lot even though we weren’t allowed. We snuck away with him sometimes after that day. One day he took us farther away than ever and we met up with a group of his friends who were all teenage boys. They pinned us down and held our jaws open and poured blue wkd down our throats. Then we went to a play park and Andrew took me into the woods by myself and pulled my trousers down and touched me. He made me touch and lick his penis and I remember thinking what is wrong with him this is gross, he pees out of that. I got my sister and went home. I didn’t tell anybody and Andrew never came to play with us again. The next time was when I was 12. It was my mums friend Richard. He was a creepy old man. Every time I was alone with him he was say how beautiful and attractive I was and how good my figure was. He always asked if I had a boyfriend and hugged me really close. He never actually molested or raped me apart from a few times he grabbed my bum and “boobs” but he gave me a phone once and said I could keep it if I didn’t tell anyone I had it. It was just a cheap one but I was happy to be given because now I had a secret phone for when my gran (who I lived with at this point after she took me out of the care home) took my normal phone off me at night. But I was horrified when I got home and switched it on and found on it about 40 pictures of his naked body and penis, with selfies of him smiling creepily. I only told one person and that was my friends Mum who was blind and she told me not to tell anyone else because he probably just forgot to delete them and it would be embarrassing for him. 
The next one is when I was 15 and I lived with my mum who was a heroin addict at the time and her boyfriend who was getting it for her. When she was out it he would come in the living room with me and we would smoke joints and drink cans or beer and watch the tv. Sometimes he would sit really close and one day he asked me to put my legs on his lap. I said no at first but he said he would have to stop buying me cigarettes and food if I didn’t. So I done it and we done that for a week or so. I got used to it but it was still a bit creepy. Then he started feeling my legs and he went further and further up until he was touching me in private areas. He would also tickle my feet so that I moved my legs around on his lap. I don’t know why I let him do these things. I feel disgusted now. One day my mum went into hospital with pneumonia and I had to stay with him alone. Social workers came to ask if I was alright with that but they asked me right in from of him so I had to say yes. During this time we slept in the same bed and had sex. When my mum came back i had a massive rage. I threw things around and broke things. I screamed and shouted and swore. I can’t even remember what it was supposed to be about. I couldn’t control myself at all. I screamed that I was going to tell someone what happened and he held my room door shut so I couldn’t get out. I picked up my electric guitar and whacked it right through the door where the handle was and it broke his wrist. I ran past him and out the front door. I picked up a brick and smashed his van window with it. The police happened to be driving by and witnessed my uncontrollable rage. They got out and pressed me down on the glass covered hood of the van and arrested me for vandalism while he stood and laughed. All I could do was scream at him. No one believed at the station about what he had done. One blond woman said I was being a little manipulative bitch who was clearly just looking for attention. Andrew didn’t want to charge me for damaging his van so I was let out. I didn’t go back home. I spent a few nights just wondering around and sleeping in closes in flats and In back gardens until I’d spent all the change I had in my pocket at the time I was arrested. It wasn’t much but I’d been drinking tap water from the bathroom at Morrison’s and buying loaves of bread To eat throughout the day. I couldn’t take the cold anymore and I went to social work begging them not to tell my mum where I was but just to find me somewhere to live. They told my mum where I was and I had to go back there for one night until they asked my biological father who I had only met twice to take me in for two weeks until I was sixteen and old enough to go into a homeless unit. In the homeless unit I was abused by 3 men. 
I was a complete mess in there. I couldn’t do anything for myself and I only had about £37 pounds per week by the time I’d paid for heating and electricity. It always just went on drugs and drink. I tried desperately to find someone to be close to and help me cope with this because I was feeling so alone and scared. But it was mostly men in there and the two girls were best pals and kept to themselves and usually spent all day in one of the flats down the road. So I was stuck with the boys. Most of them were between the ages of 18-25. They seemed nice enough and always helped me out with stuff like buying me pot noodles and letting me sit in their rooms to play their play station and for a month I was basically just one of the guys. It was good. Then one day Keiran of them said he liked me and we agreed to try being in a relationship. He got really clingy really fast and he took my virginity. I know id already had sex but this was the first time I consented. Then one day he wouldn’t stop when I told him he was hurting me. And he stopped wearing condoms and spoke about how he wanted me to get pregnant so we could get a house really quick. He was 23. I broke up with him and he hit me and raped me. I pretended like it didn’t happen. Then one day I was in Michaels room using his Ps2 which he said was fine even if he wasn’t there. He came in drunk and coked up. He forced himself on top of me and tried to rape me. But unlike Kieran he wasn’t strong enough and he only managed to touch me down there before I pushed him off and ran away. The last one was mark ferri. He was my weed guy. He had schizophrenia and lived in one of the flats near the homeless unit. I was at his flat one day to pick up some weed and we smoked a joint together. He gave me my first bong and it made me so stoned. I’d never been that stoned in my life. The floor and ceiling were spinning and I couldn’t move properly. I lay on the couch and asked him for some water and if I could just lie there for a while because I didn’t feel well. He said that’s fine and I shut my eyes and sort of half slept for a little while, just wishing for this to be over. Next thing I know he’s on top of me and he’s pulling my clothes off. I was very weak and couldn’t do anything. I did tell him no but then I was sick and I just let it happen. It went on for what felt like all night. I stood up afterwards all shaky and was sick again before I stumbled back to the homeless unit. That was the last time I have been sexually abused so far. It feels so good to get them all out at once. I am literally shaking writing this. ",13Jan2019,1
140,"Hello all I apologize in advance for the length of this post but here goes.... I've had some modicum of what I would consider depression for quite a while now, but it was always fairly minor and would only last for a short period of time whenever it did rear its ugly head. Recently I've gone through some pretty big life changes and I feel it's gotten worse. So a little background,  I got out of the army after 7 years with my sights set on landing my dream job, I had dealt with depression on my own for a time while in the military. It never effected my professional life, I was always able to cope with the stresses of the job/combat with fairly minimal difficulty, hell I was even proud of being a dependable soldier and a leader that my soldiers trusted to do right by them and bring them home. But my personal life was never great, I put a lot of myself into my job and just sorta accepted that I wasn't a happy person. Anyway I got out about 5 months ago and set to work pursuing the aforementioned dream job, a firefighter, I tested with my local department and did really well, earning myself a very good chance of being hired in the next year. I also enrolled in college classes using my GI bill which start at the end of the month. So you would probably think "" hey this guy has a lot going for him, he's doing well"" right?  and while i'm sure that's true technically speaking, I can't fight off this feeling of despair and emptiness. I've even been seeing a wonderful girl for a couple months, but keep asking myself why she's still with me, whenever we have sex I can't keep an erection for more than a couple minutes which really torpedoes my self confidence as I'm a young guy and haven't had these problems until recently. She is always super supportive and compassionate about it but I'm afraid to tell her the reason behind my uselessness in bed, I've been trying to quit watching porn for about 2 months and it's been the hardest thing i've ever tried to quit. I tell her every time that it has nothing to do with how attractive I find her (unfathomably so, she's out of my league in all facets). I just can't shake the notion that I don't deserve her because I can't please her sexually, have a shit personality, and no desirable characteristics to speak of.  All this crap has hammered my sense of self worth into near nonexistence. I often find myself questioning if i'm capable of feeling true happiness anymore, as being a miserable turd has become my comfort zone.

141,"So I just feel like I need to get some things off my chest so I'm sorry if this post is poorly typed I'm just trying to get it all out while it's in my mind.

I'm not going to work tomorrow. I haven't been back to work since we broke up for Christmas on Christmas Eve. I had a bad bought of depression/anxiety and I decided that I would return to work on Monday after going into work on Friday to talk to my boss just to get my foot in the door.

It was all going great until this evening and now I feel like really pressured and stressed again and I know when it gets to tomorrow morning I'll run away and hide from my life and responsibilities like I always do. I always do the same thing, get ready for work and drive somewhere far away and turn my phone off and get horrible thoughts going through my brain.

Work is really supportive and has told me not to worry in the past and everything seemed great on Friday but I have a feeling that they are eventually going to get sick and tired of the same thing happening over and over, this is the longest period I have had off of work so far, I just don't want to go to work I just want everyone to piss off and leave me alone. I just want to sit and do what I want but at the same time that makes me so angry that I feel like crashing my car every time I get in it.

I'm so angry, confused and upset, I've been suffering for almost 4 years now and it's to the point that I don't look forward to anything. I've been on and off medication but it keeps feeling like an uphill battle. I don't want to hurt myself but I'm always thinking that I want to die and that I'm not worth the effort it takes to keep me alive. Why should I be happy when there are others around me suffering. I just wish I could spend my life making others happy.

I'm sick of the struggle I just want to live a normal life, how do other people do it. I often people watch and am just so self aware of the fact that all of these people are living their lives like I'm supposed to except they're actually going about their daily lives and not sitting in a pit wondering how to get out. 

Anyway, I'm not sure how much longer my job will take this from me, it wouldn't be the first job I've lost because of my condition but the stakes are a lot higher this time as I have a lot more responsibility now. Which really stacks on the pressure and makes the boiling point that much worse.

If anyone actually reads this, thanks for listening to my struggles. I haven't really posted this for any reason except to get it out there. This is a private account so I'm not too worried about anyone seeing it, maybe it will help getting my words out into the public without the fear of it coming back to me like speaking to a real person would.
