We reached out a while ago, looking for stories from people's experiences dealing with mental illness or mental health issues. We've had a few people who've reached out with extremely important, special and relatable stories.

I would love nothing more than for as many to see, read, and relate with this piece as possible - it's truly a powerful piece of writing. You can read it below, and if you're interested in sharing it, you can find it by searching PEAR Blog on Google, or I will post the link in the comments. 

Thank you so much &amp; let's continue to talk in the open, discuss and end the stigmas surrounding mental illnesses! It may seem long on here, but I truly believe it's an important and valuable read.



**The Importance of Self Advocacy – Michelle Halsey**

Thank God. That’s how I felt when my new psychiatrist diagnosed me as having Bipolar II.  I’m so relieved. 

I imagine many people who’ve received such a diagnosis understand how I felt that day. And those who hadn’t spent their lives questioning previous diagnoses? Well, they might wonder how anyone would consider it good news. 

A week shy of my 47th birthday, my psychiatrist handed me the lens through which I could look back on my life and begin to accept and forgive myself. But there was neither a chorus of angels nor beams of light shining down from heaven. Clarity and hindsight? It’s excruciating. 

**The process of processing**


Over the next several months, I balanced self-forgiveness with gut-kicking, cringeworthy epiphanies. I mourned the life I might have lived had I been correctly diagnosed earlier, and I relived heartbreak all over again when I re-evaluated failed relationships. 

How much could I attribute to Bipolar II? After all, like others with or without mental illness, my upbringing and life experiences shaped my behavior and personality. Crappy family dynamics, attachment issues, confronting a sexual abuser, a failing business (or two). At one point in my mid-30s, the fallout from these experiences came to a head and I went fetal. Caught In a deep depression and black eddy of self-loathing, I couldn’t reach out for help on my own. Friends who knew me best when I was hypomanic thought of me as a “warrior princess”, and couldn’t grasp that I’d become helpless. “You’ll bounce!” they’d say. “Let’s go out to breakfast, you’ll feel better.” 

Other friends resented me because once again, I was in “ghosting mode”. Because that’s what I do when I’m in those troughs. Nobody wants to be around a downer, right? That’s what we’re told growing up. Besides, I could barely take a shower, much show up to a good friend’s birthday party. 

Nobody wants to believe that by default, they’re an asshole. Anyone with self-awareness and empathy wants to become a better person. Our entire lives, those of us with mood disorders tried to change, but cycling through the severe lows of depression and the rush of hypomania is challenging enough when we’re aware of our patterns and have the tools to manage them. When we think we’re just bouncing between burnout and raging success, we see ourselves differently. 

We’re weak. We’re dramatic. We’re feeling sorry for ourselves. We’re selfish for wanting to die.

Only after a massive, chest-exploding panic attack sent me to the E.R. (I thought I was having a heart attack) did I realize I needed to get help. The cycle of guilt and loneliness had become too much. I knew if I was willing to take myself to the hospital, some part of me wasn’t ready to give up.

**If therapy isn’t helping, is it my fault?** 


What if, after seeking professional help, we put too much faith in our mental health providers and not enough in our own instincts?

A friend of a friend referred me to Dr. Bob (definitely not his real name) whose website listed him as having a Ph.D. in psychology. He offered testing and evaluations, and on my first appointment, he handed me several questionnaires. The results? I was under a tremendous amount of stress, definitely depressed, showing signs of suicidal ideation, and suffering from extreme anxiety.

Thank you, Captain Obvious! 

He recommended twice-weekly visits for the first few weeks. Fair enough, I thought. I sure felt like I needed all the help I could get. 

My insurance didn’t cover his $150-per-session fees, so my mom agreed to foot the bill and Dr. Bob and I went to work. He wasn’t licensed to prescribe medications, but he shared his suite with a nurse practitioner who could. She immediately put me on an antidepressant, and Dr. Bob requested that I order pretty much anything ever produced by John Kabat-Zinn, the father of mindfulness meditation: CDs, workbooks, the works. 

It helped. I learned to recognize and shut down the nasty “inner critic” that constantly told me I was worthless. After a few weeks, my mood changed dramatically, and Dr. Bob encouraged me to pursue recreational interests “just for me”, as I’d dedicated the past few years to getting my then-boyfriend through a contentious divorce and custody battle, and my mother through the stress of her husband being a white-collar criminal.

Not only was I handling things, I was killing it. I got a new job, took up beekeeping (!) and my friends announced that the warrior princess had returned. After a couple of months, I took a break from counseling… and a half-year later, I crashed once again. 

The cycle continued. Over and over. 

I know now that patients will seek therapy when they’re down, but often not go when things are going well. This is how my current doctor soothed my frustration when I got my new and improved diagnosis. But back then, I felt I was letting Dr. Bob down. Wasn’t I meditating hard enough? Why couldn’t I make myself better? I asked Dr. Bob several times if he thought I might have something more serious than a major depressive disorder. He insisted I didn’t. 

In spite of going overboard with certain interests—I was aware of how obsessive I could get—he brushed it off as my being curious and passionate. I was getting better! But on the downswings, I was back to feeling like a loser. I felt I was letting him down, especially since he was now charging me on a sliding scale since even my mom had given up on my recovery. Inwardly, I doubted my erratic behavior was “just who I am.”

On my last visit, I worked up the nerve to ask one last time: Was this just clinical depression and anxiety? It wasn’t just my paranoia; I could tell he was frustrated and annoyed by a lack of faith. Then he dropped this bomb: 

“I don’t really believe in the DSM-5 criteria anymore; I think more in terms of (some weird system using Venn diagrams). Really, I think you have histrionic tendencies. But that doesn’t mean you’re histrionic!”

Histrionic?!? I knew what that meant, at least in terms of vernacular language. I was horrified. To me, it meant I’d made all this up, that I was just overly dramatic. It would have been worse if he’d said I was officially narcissistic or borderline. I interpreted it as an unsolvable character flaw. So I left and never saw him again. I felt I was a lost cause, and that I’d soured yet another relationship. I even discontinued my meds, which of course I had to do since I was once again without health insurance, and obviously, they weren’t working anyway. 

**Stress vs sanity**


Life went on, and so did my mood swings. I continued to believe that the peaks were phases of extraordinary brilliance and productivity, though I made massively horrible decisions. Taking a mortgage on my home to invest in a doomed business. Booting people out of my life—for better or worse. Being irritable with those who stuck around. Dealing (badly, and angrily) with enormous family-related stress that, if adapted for television, would have been a crossover between Game of Thrones and Arrested Development, party magician, indictments, fealty demands and all.

I got my heart broken in a whirlwind romantic relationship and immediately jumped into another. And I ultimately decided to sell the house before I defaulted, dragging my poor boyfriend to a small town in another state. I went from barely-able-to-ready-my-house-for-listing to I’m going to conquer the world! But I quickly spent the proceeds from my house on 20 undeveloped acres and the ridiculous notion of building a cabin and small farm from the ground up—by myself. I barely got started before, you guessed it, I went down in flames. 

And now, we’re back to the beginning, when I found Dr. Ben (and yes, I made up his name, too.) 

**So what now?** 


My new doctor explained to me, without disparaging Dr. Bob, that his science-enhanced Psy.D degree and status as a clinical psychologist gave him better insight into diagnosing mental illnesses. I’m fortunate that he’s a pharmaceutical nerd, and that a combination of Lamictal and lithium worked beautifully straight out of the gate. I know through support forums that some patients go through years of trial and error with their meds. 

Dr. Ben recommended that I see him as well as a therapist, as CBT really does play an essential supporting role in mental wellness. I’ve been learning to trust myself again. No, good ideas and excitement aren’t necessarily hypomania, but it’s good to have trusted loved ones to advise. Which, of course, forces me to learn how to ask for help from those I’d mistakenly assumed would consider me a burden.

A little anxiety is good—it prompts us to meet deadlines, remember to turn off the stove, and behave like decent humans on an everyday basis. But the overwhelming fear I used to feel was gone, and I’m learning to tell the difference between situational blues and a chemical dip in my mood. 

I’ve made my inner voice my bitch and nurtured what I call the internal “big sister”… and she’s nothing like the toxic relatives who, with reliable advice, I removed from my life. 

I now feel safe holding my doctor accountable. He’s great at explaining things, but I had to insist, against pushback, that he remove a third medication to my cocktail because the side effects were too much to handle. I’ve also given him grief for consistently being late. I’ve had to tell him that I’m not interested in discussing which celebrities or fictional characters might also be on the spectrum, and that it probably would be unethical for him to hire me to ghostwrite his book. 

He’s an odd duck, but everything about him, other than his inability to tell time, has helped me restructure my life and the way I identify as a human being. I’m making progress in my efforts to forgive my cringe-worthy behavior and face forward. I feel less sorrow that my diagnosis didn’t come earlier, as I focus on what I can do now and the gratitude of having a new start. Have I lost some of the characteristics that made me a warrior princess? Sure. Have the meds had their side-effects? A few, but the benefits leave them in the dust. 

Bipolar II is limiting, but I’m finding the workarounds. I’m fortunate to have found flexible work as a freelance business writer, and I recently accepted a position as the caretaker of an enormous unoccupied ranch where they owners simply want me to mow the grass, use the garden space, fend off tweakers and make sure the place doesn’t burn to the ground. I think I can handle that.

My boyfriend’s still around, though he’s just as wary as I am that inspiration equals illness, so I’m constantly reassuring that I won’t be signing up for a Martian colony anytime soon. And instead of feeling bad for putting him through all this, I’ve decided it’s his choice. And if he’s still here, it’s because I’m worth it. 

Which is nice, because after nearly 50 years, I feel the same way.",27Aug2019,1

I can't afford a therapist and I can't see a doctor to get meds for this.

I cry literally every single day. Sometimes over nothing. Seriously. Nothing. Like now, I'm laying in my bed with the lights off and bawling.

I don't have ANY friends. I have a bf who loves me but I feel like I'm ruining our relationship because I can't get out of this pit. I feel invalidated and like I'm pushing him away every time I bring up something that I'm feeling. I know 70% of the time I bring something up it's because my depression and anxiety is having me overanalyze everything and assume the worst in every situation, but it still hurts to be told what I'm feeling isn't real. There's no reason behind it.

I can't make a friend to save my life. Literally.

I'm on the edge of being suicidal again and I need help but I also need a SUPPORT SYSTEM And I feel like I don't have that and I can't get that.

I feel lost and alone and abandoned. I've reached out to everyone I can think of and nothing's helped and idk what to do anymore.

6,"As soon as I realized that My Brain is now at, or at least very near it’s peak of Full Development. (Which usually is approximately 25 years of age and I'm 24, however I suffer a mild brain condition more commonly known as Autism.

Autism affects the way you behave around others socially and also with certain interests. For Example I am all entirely Book-Smart based,  (Knowledgeable), but misfortunately lack a large portion of ""street-smart"", It is embarrassing to admit but with the way Autism affects the human brain I realized this.

20 years ago in 1999, Age 4, They diagnosed me with a Considerably far more mild/high functioning form of Autism.  

What a stupid name, yeah, I got “Asperger's” Syndrome….

Alright look....

Asperger's doesn’t even truly exist, Hans Asperger’s (Austrian Pediatrician)  just named the condition after himself with his own knowledge and studies in various mental disorders he majored in at that time.

I often joked that Mr. Hans Asperger himself, pulled the NAME that I HATED WITH A PASSION since my early-elementary school years, He pulled the name ""Asperger's"" for the mental disorder, “right out of his ass”. sorta speak lmao.    

I have now only been drinking one or two, Standard 12oz. bottles of Coors Light (4%) a day with also a night or two off with a couple zero alc. or de-alc. beers U.05-0.0%.

This has been working great, I actually feel like I’m 16/17 again, I’m not, I’m not even just as happy, I’m actually “Happier” then what I was in a glorified time of my life”, and I thought you know what, I’ll use it to my advantage and make the most of what life has to offer. 

After I turned 24 years of age, I had my “quarter-life crisis” a year in advance. 

I realized how short life really is, realizing that I truly don’t have all the time in the world like I did at age 4 or 5 when starting kindergarten or at age 14 or 15 when starting High School, Or Age 18 or 19 when you start up College, I miss those days alot and may consider going back to school even and I never even dreamed of saying this just two years ago. 

I honestly don’t want to be getting smashed and shitfaced all the goddamn time. 

Yeah, that's real fun when your like F\*\*\*'N 16/17….

There's a lot more to life then doing the same, dumbass shit You've already been doing since you post-puberty adolescence (Partying) I’m sure did and loved it then, then again, I drank small amounts with a very-low-tolerance weekends with several consecutive weekends in a row with no alcohol or drug use, often thinking nothing of it. 

Somewhere around the ages of say 18 or 19, I snapped and began doing it all the time because in Canada, It is legal to do so at either 18/19 varying from Province to Province. (LDA is set at 19 here in Ontario). I have been of legal age for now over 5+ years.  

I was fucking up huge well into my Early 20's, I will be completely honest, I was a fucking meat-head when I was 21/22 in 2017. 

I drank everyday, got mad over the stupidest, most irrelevant shit that had no relevance or significance to anything real or at all rational 

I turned 24 then thought ""Gee my quarter-life crisis is coming, Then actually had it, just a year earlier than I anticipated I outta grow the fuck up and actually commit to a decent life-style because I only get one life so I will do my best to make the most of it as well as staying healthy both physically and mentally as well as being both active physically and mentally, I got the idea to start goal-setting as well as making regulations for moderate and responsible alcohol consumption.

I set out these rules and guidelines for myself.

* Do NOT Consume Over FOUR units Per DAY. (Or 5 units of Light Beer only 4%).
* Do NOT Drinking Before 19:30 military time, (=7:30pm) that is about an hour from now.
* Drink Two Cups of Cold Water as soon as I wake up (Between 6:00am-9:00am so about 7:30am). 

I then turn on my stove-top and put a huge peter frying pan on that shit, then Ima put sum bacon up in that bitch. Plop two Everything-Bagels in My Eminem Toaster, Then throw in anywhere from 3 to 5 large-sized Eggs, scrambling that s\*\*\* up. (Dane Cook, My older-25yo-brother and I love bacon and eggs for breakfast literally everyday, because it is fuck'n delicious! 

They don’t call breakfast the Most Important Meal Of The Day for Noth’N! 

It also helps with my anxiety and panic when I eat a full hearty meal (Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner). Lunch and Dinner is generally lighter, yet still nutritional at typical/standard Lunch/Dinner times.  

Since my 24th, I now have been consistently doing this nutritional meal routine between 6-9, EVERY MORNING/SEVEN DAYS A WEEK.

I honestly couldn't give two fucks whether it be Sunday or Wednesday Ima making a good Hearty Healthy, Hump'N Breakfast.

Do NOT POST ONLINE or BROWSE SOCIAL MEDIA when you are anything intoxicated (I put my phone on Airplane Mode so Not Only Do People Don't Bug Me.

Also went I am Sober, My money management skills went up 1000% because I am not spending my money on ridiculous amounts of alcohol, like I had previously been doing for well over two years. Aswell as not being like “Oh LoOk McF\*\*\*’N DoNaLds”. $20 dollars later…. 

I now rarely eat fast food and pretty much live off off Chunky Soups, Frozen Pizza’s, Whatever food special’s in our local grocery store fyler has and I save a S\*\*\* Ton! 

I also play hockey 4 times a week now that I am sober, I love hockey and have been playing since I was 6-years-old (2001). 

When I wake up in the morning now my first thoughts are “Time To Hit The Gym” I will never, ever miss waking up like “PfFfFfT! DoH WhErE's My BoNgTokE, Or “WhErE’s My RuM”.

My parents got me a 24h gym membership since my 24th Birthday and I thought rationally, that I'd better commit to it, and use it to my advantage.

I have been gaining far more weight after spending so many years of my adult-life looking like a 105 pound ninth grader due to poor hygiene and health choices. 

I shower everyday, I shave everyday, I brush twice, two minutes per time just like they taught me in Grade2, back in 2002). 

As soon as I finally finished typing this after editing it for almost 6 hours (As soon as I got home from The Beer Store around 13:30 earlier this afternoon, I then put my 6pack of 12oz. Heineken's.

Time for a nice ice cold beer before my crossword/sudoku, 

“He’s gonna drink the whole 6 pack” 

Even If I did end up drinking all 6 which, yeah I might, but fuck it! I earned it!

I used to drink 12 bottles within 2 hours back when I had a ridiculously and not feel jack shit if I have let alone four or five of them things, I will feel right FUCKED! Just like I did 7 or 8 years back in the “glory days” except only now I am smarter, and wiser than my younger 16-year-old self, who still was a hell of a lot smarter smarter than the dumbass that I once was at age 20. 

Why wouldn’t I want to drink all six of the 6 pack?

Because, like my tolerance to cannabis, I Successfully Hacked my Tolerance that the Anxiety consuenqes actually outweight any negative Depressive behavior (Drinking 12 can beers often can KILL YOU! But when your DEPRESSED, you just DON’T GIVE A SHIT. Then do it anyway! (Not good, not good at all).  

Within just a few hours, I’ll probably be out like a light as I have been doing All Month Long successfully regulating my Alcohol/Cannbis consumption (Fuck Darts and Energy Drinks, I quit those and have been Tobacco Free 9 months yesterday (Since SunNov25’18).

I am excited and happy that I can now use these goals and regulations for the rest of my life and I will be a lot happier as well as healthier as I get older and older, ah shit it's actually 20:19 now and I’m kinda really tired after typing all this shit up, altering and editing it thoroughly since like 14:00/AKA2:00pm.  

I have the full six pack in my fridge, (6-pack of 12oz bottle’s of Heineken) which cost $14.95 (Just Like a standard wash from A1A Car Wash from Breaking Bad (My second favourite American Crime-Drama Series of all time behind Dexter).",27Aug2019,22

I know I’m ADHD, and I do have a habit of procrastinating my assignments in school And it feels like I want to do so much that I do nothing at all. I eventually do everything the night before or request extensions from my professors who fortunately worked with me. But when I’m procrastinating these assignment, I’ll be painting or drawing or reading the latest article on unearthed mummies or current events or scientific studies. It feels like I’m being productive in ways that carry no weight to my future.

I used to be able to focus on topics for hours intensely, learning very fast, and it allowed me to pick up a few hobbies growing up, all of which I excelled at.

I do really want to go so I can have a somewhat promising future, but I always end up saying to myself ""I'll just stay off for one more day"" and it just keeps on stretching onto more and more days. Is there any reason as to why I seem to just not be bothered at all? Is it just some intense laziness? I don't know why but it's like I almost find going scary even though I know it's fine. It's the same thing with going to things like the dentist too. I've thought that it might be something like depression, but in my everyday life (which is essentially being in the house 24/7 other than going in the car when my dad goes to the shop but not going into the shop itself) I'm pretty happy. I do get down sometimes when I think of how boring my life is when I'm alone, but overall I'm fine the (probably vast) majority of the time with how it is, especially when my family is up and around. I've noticed it's when I'm alone like during the night when my sleep pattern is fucked is when I start to feel down. I understand that if I don't pick up I probably won't have any good future worth being happy about in the slightest, but I just don't know why I can't seem to push myself out into actually doing things to improve myself.",27Aug2019,1
18,"I've been feeling for awhile that perhaps my therapist isn't very trauma informed. He claims that most of his clients are abuse survivors, but I am starting to feel re-traumatized by the therapy process. He talks about other clients frequently, and one time I recognized the client before me from another group. I asked if he would change my appointment so I didn't see her again. He got really defensive and said, ""I have 4 clients who were abused in the same underground pedophile ring, I need to know if you're a 5th."" I took this as a disclosure of personal information about the client I knew and it made me very uncomfortable. He also tends to be quite provocative in his approach. He once said to me, ""The only way this day could get any worse is if a dozen men who look like your father were in your driveway waiting to rape you."" I can't help but leave appointments feeling manipulated, degraded, and betrayed. Is this part of the process? Is the goal supposed to be to re-trigger these feelings to help the client work through them? I don't want to blow this out of proportion and turn it into something it's not.",27Aug2019,1
19,"So,  after 14 years of dealing with,  whatever it is I'm dealing with,  today was the first time I sought out help from m doctor.  I'm sick of feeling this way,  I want to enjoy my life again, i want to be able to feel excited again,  I want to be able to feel like someone might actually care for me rather than feel disgusted by me,  I want to be able to accept myself.  So my doctor have me a referral snd offered to write me a script.....and i declined. 

I'm scared of pills.   Let me explain a bit more,  I'm a man of medical science.  I work in Biomedical Engineering,  I know about the chemistry of the brain and body snd I know that I either was born this way or developed it and that I'm likely lacking somehting fundemental in my brain,   and I know depression is no different than any other disease,  and diabetic patient need insulin,  so anti depressants  shouldn't be any different.   I've been taking medication for a heart thing for years,  this should be no different........but i can't bring myself to accept them. 

I'm terrified that I won't be me anymore,  I'm terrified of side effects (i really don't want any weight gain, weight loss or weirs dick stuff),  and I'm so scared that if I go on these I may jist never come off of them and they'll.....rule my life, i guess. 

Wondering if snyone on here might be willing to give their opinions and experiences?     Have pills helped?  Have they not?    Any advice for a 27 year old guy who feels like he's losing his mind?",27Aug2019,3
20,"For a while, I have wished that I could some how steal my therapist’s notes on me. Over the year that I have seen this person, I was lead to believe that he was completely anti-medication and anti-diagnosis, but somehow felt like he was afraid to use more technical terms, and instead use more words to describe them. I started to become suspicious that he was filtering certain things form me and I think my suspicion was confirmed.
Recently, he did something completely different from his typical approach, which was take out a copy of the DSM and open it up. I found out that he has thought that I very likely fit the ASD criteria for quite a while. He said something about not wanting to lose my trust or cause me to become defensive shortly after he shared his thoughts. I am wondering if there is anything else like this that he for whatever reason, does not wish to share with me. Has anyone else dealt with this? If so, what approaches have you taken to handling it?",27Aug2019,1
21,"Hi! My first post was months back, and it was on the r/mentalillness community.

I chose to not go with the school psychologist plan, since a friend told me they sent their friend’s friend to a mental institution/hospital/psychward. Not really sure which, but I know I simply don’t want to go to one since it would be too much of a hassle, and to be real, I believed my symptoms didn’t reach a point to where I would need intense treatment at a mental facility. But then again, I don’t know how those places work. 

Just know that I want to thank everyone who commented on my previous post months back and willing to dm, seriously meant a lot and still gives me hope. Still awkward about thanking since I just don’t feel like it really expresses my gratitude. Link of my first post at the end of this post (since I’m lazy about tagging). 

Also if for some reason any of you who read this feel guilty they didn’t help me, please it’s okay. I’m not blaming you for anything, don’t worry too much! I’m only saying this because I’ve felt this. 

I’m no longer suicidal or having as much ideations of it as I did back then. I’m managing to cope with depressive and anxiety-like symptoms. I still have a bit of self-esteem issues, insecurities, but nothing that affects me to the extent of making me feel like I’m at rock bottom. None yet! I have flaws that don’t always want me to improve, and I sometimes try to identify them and work with them in order to improve myself. Doesn’t always work, but it’s life. Trial and error! 

This will most likely be my last post about my mental health. If not, then it’s not lol.

23,"So, this has been a thing with me for almost my entire life, being that I am super insecure about my skills, despite having a lot of them. I will actively try to be one of the best in anything I do. I got super good at video games because I was tired of my brothers beating me all the time. I learned to play 5 different instruments simply because I felt like one wasn’t enough. I learned to draw out of nowhere, and became good at fabric arts, writing, etc. 
here’s the problem with all that, I just keep trying to almost beat everybody at most things.  I’m so used to being at the top end of the skill level, when I see someone actively doing better than me at something my insecurities pop up and then give me a panic attack/mental breakdown. Whatever creative work I do, I feel like it’s never good enough, and that I can’t show it to anyone until it’s almost perfect, I can’t even show people my drawings that I’m not as proud of without tearing something to bits out of anxiety. I will actively try to make things more complicated for myself, the only reason I can see is to impress others, but yet it never feels like enough for me. I can’t help but wonder if all of this try hard attitude is from me feeling like I was a ghost during my childhood, always left out, simply just “there” for most of my peers. Maybe I thought that if I can impress them with what I can do then maybe someone will at least talk to me of their own volition. Of course, this could just be a mix of my social anxiety, my normal anxiety, and my depression talking (they’ve made a bit of a return since entering college)

I can’t put exactly what I’m feeling into words, but some close words include: inadequate, insignificant, self doubt, insecure, like something is wrong simply by existing
I can hardly remember what I even wanted to say simply because of the little mental breakdown I just had because my art skills seem inadequate in the face of others in the same class",27Aug2019,1
24,"22/f I feel like I could just break down right now I don’t know what to do. I feel out of options. If anyone will listen to me I would really appreciate it because I feel like I have no one to talk to. I am not sure what’s wrong with me but I feel like my brain always needs me to be worried or upset about something and it’s making me feel hopeless and isolated.

I’ll try to explain this as easily as possible. 

My boyfriend of 3 years and I were relaxing last night watching a movie. I was having a great time. In the movie the guy confessed to cheating on his wife years ago. It freaked me out and I wondered how anyone could do that. Then I started spiraling and becoming very anxious all at once. 


I remembered that 2 years ago (while I was dating my boyfriend) I used to think it was okay to talk to guys at parties, in all honesty in a flirty way, as long as I didn’t do anything with them. I’ve always considered myself loyal and couldn’t even think about cheating. I literally thought I was doing nothing wrong until I found out by boyfriend was sending loving and romantic messages to this girl he was “friends” with. Long story short we had a long talk and my mindset completely changed. I confessed how I was being shitty by being flirty with guys at parties and realized how that was not okay just as it wasn’t okay for him to be talking to that girl in that way. It hurt him so much and I was devastated. I love and care about him so much and our relationship has grown so much stronger I am so scared to fuck up.

After I became more aware of how I was flirting I’m now honestly much more anxious than I was before. For example, talking to a coworker who’s a guy and makes me laugh makes me feel like I’m doing something wrong and I will literally stress about it all day. During my peak anxiety immediately following my realization, I would purposely dress in baggy clothes and wouldn’t even want to make eye contact with men at the grocery store. 

It’s been about a year and a half since my anxiety was that bad and all I wanted to do was stay at home where I couldn’t do anything wrong. I’ve normalized a bit, but I still get flashbacks to when I was flirty with guys at parties and it makes me feel like complete shit.

Last night I randomly remembered a time where I flirted with a guy at an October 2017 party. We started talking because we were sitting next to each other on a couch. I remember being extremely drunk. I remember this was probably the worst I’ve acted of any, I remember being super attracted to this guy and just acting super flirty. It bothers me that I can’t remember our whole conversation because I was drunk and makes me so anxious. I remember for some reason he brought me to a corner in the room (still around plenty of people because the party was so packed) I remember closing my eyes and he shook my shoulders asking if I was okay because I was so drunk. That’s all I remember. I think my whole interaction with him lasted maybe 10 minutes. I remember afterwards thinking nothing of it and not even realizing it was shitty to flirt with him until my boyfriend and I had our long talk about a month after this happened. I remember that nothing had happened with the guy.

For some reason last night when my bf and I were watching a movie I remembered what happened with the guy at that party. I got very nervous upon realizing my memory was spotty and it freaked me out and made me worry what if something happened. In my heart I don’t think it did it just freaks me out that my friends weren’t around and I have no witnesses. I remember thinking that nothing happened immediately after and I know that’s what I should go off of, but because my memory has faded so much from that night being it was 2 years ago and I was drunk, I suddenly started worrying what if what if??? 


I understand this probably sounds crazy I just feel like I can’t trust myself and always am trying to make myself the bad guy I have no idea why I thought of this situation from 2 years ago and I know that after I knew nothing happened and I remember thinking I did nothing wrong so clearly I shouldn’t be worried that something happened I just can’t stop freaking myself out.

If anyone has any tips or advice or just kind words reassuring me please let me know because I’m a complete wreck right now. Thanks.",27Aug2019,1

26,"I hate to say it, but it's true. I need some help processing these feelings. 

When I was skinny, they would never stop harassing me. Follow me home. Make me feel unsafe. Grab me. When I gained weight, they treated me like an invisible piece of furniture. Spoke down to me. My very existence became an annoyance. My experience with men has always been that of being harassed, being in danger, or being ignored. 

My father beat my mother and tried to drown me when I was a little girl. Earlier in my life (about 8 years ago), I myself ended up in a relationship with a man who abused me: mentally, emotionally, and physically. I eventually successfully got away from him, but all this time later, his voice still haunts me. I'm fine now, but largely due to self-isolation: I've been too afraid to date for about two years. Either in fear of abuse, or because of what men will tell their friends about my now-heavier body. (Mischa Barton looks perfectly fine and lovely in [this photo](https://www.reddit.com/r/barstoolsports/comments/bzhcn1/there_was_a_time_when_i_thought_mischa_barton_was/); nevertheless, countless men who no doubt have man tits are insulting her appearance. A couple of people who stood up for her got massively downvoted.) 

We have a man that's bragged about grabbing women by the genitalia in the White House. He's been accused of assault and rape by multiple women. If that wasn't bad enough, a man who attempted rape made it into the Supreme Court. 

They make up the vast majority of killers. The vast majority of rapists. The vast majority of pedophiles. And speaking of which, so many older men leave their partners to pursue relationships with barely-legal ""women."" 

The internet is filled with misogyny. Everywhere I go on Reddit, YouTube, and elsewhere...if the subject of the post has anything even remotely to do with women, you will find men calling us names like ""worthless holes."" Or casually say that feminists are killjoys. Or complain about women who don't want to be sexually harassed ""overly sensitive."" 

I just can't take it. It makes me not want to have anything to do with the male gender. I know there are some good men out there, my grandfather was one. But honestly, if my experience was representative of all men, 98% of them would be bad.",27Aug2019,5

Tomorrow I have an appointment before school starts back up again (for social anxiety reasons) and my dad won't be able to take me because he has a dentist appt.

33,"Idk what's wrong with me. I know this isn't gonna get me a professional diagnosis but meh. Maybe someone else has these feelings and knows what to do. So I'm generally very relaxed and don't really overreact to negative stuff, but for some reason since I was about 13 or 14 I randomly during certain situations like sitting in class or at school assemblies I get the impending doom feeling and start having awful thoughts. I start getting dizzy and really nervous and just get that trapped feeling where I need to escape somewhere or just lay down for a while. And you know what happens if I don't either relax or get away? I pass out. Super embarrassing and scary for everyone else. Happened probably 4 times through middle school and so far in highschool, and I still get the feeling a lot. It just makes me panic meanwhile literally nothing is happening. I don't know if I need some kind of relaxant drug or something but I want it to end, that's why I'm dreading school starting again, I know it's gonna start happening to me again. I skipped school assemblies and took long ""bathroom breaks"" during class to avoid the feeling or to relieve it. It works but it's hard to make it happen. I think I should maybe let my teachers this year know bc I think they'd rather I take a little walk instead of pass out in their class. I don't know but a girl in one of my classes did that last year bc I think she had a fainting problem too. Anyways im just kinda rambling but does anyone else feel this way or have this experience?

36,"Hi. I am a 20yo f and likely nuts even though I'm in therapy and take meds. I am expected to house sit for a week mentalhealth. 

Here's what you need to know about me. I have been through trauma my entire life, from gaslighting to emotional abuse from an entire friend group including my boyfriend to manipulation to bullying to hearing and vitnessing these things on others, to fearing for my life to fearing for my family members lives all the way down to being subtly put down by my best friend for the first 11 years of my life. 

This has left me paranoid, scared, feeling helpless and weak, feeling worthless, etc.

My coworker wants me to watch her house while she is away. Here's what you need to know about her. 

She is 50, pretty, originally from the northern US and is now living in the Midwest, has a family and three children all around my age and younger. She knows everyone, is very friendly, and seems to be the most thoughtful person I work with. She and I cried together over her talking about her daughter, one of our coworkers losing her daughter, and my recently telling her that something happened to me. 

However, there are small things that set me off about her. When I first started working there she sized me up by asking a bunch of questions and the last question was, ""what do you do with your friends?"" I told her we do boring stuff and hang out sometimes. She said ""boring, okay."" And walked away as if she'd gotten her answer. My car had trouble and she had just been slamming around the trash while talking to me about what I did to my car, she then said to me in a sinister voice as she was walking away, ""well keep fixing it, because you'll have a new car soon."" Often times throughout the days I've worked with her she will say something at the end of a conversation that is weird, quirky, or plain scary and nonsensical. She and I were talking about payday and she said ""I like Mac and cheese."" As I was walking away. I almost turned around and asked her what? But she said it loud enough for it to be unmistakable. Yes, Mac and cheese...?? Recently we were talking about payday again and she said, ""it's exchange day!"" And I said what's that? She told me she's got lots of bills to pay so it's like she is exchanging her pay stub.

**If you've gotten this far, congrats, you've survived my psycho rambling. Here comes the juicy part.** One day we were walking to the back room and she knows I have paranoia so she said ""you think we're gonna lock you up huh?"" 

Another time she and I were having lunch in the break room and she told me, ""you know that guy that came in that was pretending to speak in an Australian accent with his kid?"" I said yes. She said ""you might be the only one to understand this, but I got this thought that maybe that little kid was in the sex trades and he was from Australia and the older guy was trying to make it sound like a joke."" I didn't tell her she was crazy, (because she and I both know that's the crazy anxiety that I have too) and she said that she'd be worried because ""american men would tear him apart."" Then I asked her how long she's had this anxiety and she told me she's had it ever since she had a miscarriage. 

Now what I'm thinking

What I'm thinking is that with all of this knowing what I'm thinking, knowing about my paranoia, etc, she is trying to relate to me in a way that makes me trust her. Now she wants me to come spend the week at her house while she is away (is she really away?) And when I am sleeping over, someone will come take me and put me into sex trafficking. And that her family either doesn't know or is all in on it and running a business. Her license plate only has 3 letters. I don't know what that's about. Anyways. 


If you've made it all the way to the end here you're probably the only one. So please, could you share any thoughts you're having or any advice you have?

37,"So not ever been diagnosed with anything mental health and don't really know much about it but lately it's Dawned on me just how much I worry about everything and I wondered if it was anxiety or basically me being stupid.

All my life I've only spoken to people who had first spoken to me and kept 2 or three friends as ,not to complicate things, even as far back as primary school. In secondary school it was much the same and is still to this day. 

I am in University doing my last year and still the thought of interaction with other people, terrifies the shit out of me. It's stoped me joining any societies and making any friends and Even things like shopping for groceries or walking in public are supper embarrassing or worrying. If I see someone, anyone I don't know I have to cross the road and avoid them.

Something happened about a year ago that made me feel absolutely worthless. Logically speaking, I can reason out why things happened the way they did, but the fact so many people shut me out gives me pause. That many people can't be wrong, right'? Must be something wrong with *me*. After ruminating on it for months on end, filled with suicidal thoughts and bouts of miserable sobbing I decided to leave the pieces on the floor and move the fuck on. Problem is, I've inadvertently conditioned myself to constantly think of the same people involved in the event that got me here in the first place. Didn't know it was possible, but I literally think about them and what happened every minute of every day. Even when I'm doing something else, they're always in the background. I see their faces first thing when I wake, and see them again, vividly, right before bed. Thought I was done with the crying, but just now it came again and didn't hurt any less than it did ten months ago. It's been ten months. I don't even know who I used to be anymore.

How do I move on from this? I feel so Goddamn broken, and even though I'm lonely as hell the thought of infecting kind people with whatever defect I have is simply unacceptable. The way I've been treated, the way I've been viewed in the past by others. It makes me feel embarrassed to a degree that I can't allow myself to meet anyone new. How can I laugh, or joke as if these things didn't happen? The best I can hope for is to be self-sufficient, and do my best to keep people away from me. I can suffer just fine on my own. No need to involve anyone else. But these thoughts are crippling to where most days it takes all I have just to feed myself or exercise to any significant degree. I can't move on, and it's killing me. Just not fast enough.

My only crime was caring too much, trusting people that didn't deserve it, and being this painfully, out-of-place mess of a person that I am. Somebody help me move on from this.",27Aug2019,1
40,"Just want to preface this by saying I'm not about to harm myself, I just don't understand what's going on with my head and want to vent. Obviously this is something I will discuss with my therapist, I see him this week it's just I haven't seen him for about 6 weeks. I'm also in hospital this week so I'll bring certain things up there too. 

I'm going through a really tough time with seemingly every part of my life. The last few months have been hard. My body's falling apart, my relationship is falling apart, my brain is crumbling. People at work could tell something is wrong before I could. 

I don't even know what's wrong anymore. I have anxiety and OCD (I do see a therapist for those) but I don't know what this is. My mental health is ruining my relationship and a lot of me doesn't even care anymore, even if I still love my partner, it's just that my brain didn't even react when he sounded like he was about to end the relationship, all I kept thinking was ""do it I don't care anymore"" in the most tranquil and chilled way, not upset, but I know I care deep down and I don't want him to leave me. My manager even pulled me aside to say her and multiple people at work have noticed something isn't right. I didn't even realise until now. 

I was silently crying in a ball after an argument with my SO just a little bit ago, and the only thing that made me stop crying and tensing, was the thought of dying. I just instantly got happier and it felt nice. I was so at peace with the idea of dying and images of killing myself that it was almost scary. This has happened 3 times in the last week and each time I have no idea what to think about it. 

I've attempted suicide a few times between the ages of 11-14 and I'm 21 now, but I never felt like this during those times. At those points I was going through some horrible shit and was filled with such a deep sadness and anguish and had a few breakdowns. But this is something different. There's no hysterics, no tears, just tranquility. I don't care, I feel unnaturally unfased by things. I feel like I wouldn't even flinch if someone held a knife to my throat and I'd just keep staring off into nothing. I'm not scared of death or the potential pain of dying any more. Again, I don't want to kill myself, it's just that the thought calms me right now and makes me feel at peace at a time when I can't find any anywhere. 

I think I spent so long acting like I was fine after I had  surgery gone wrong that very well could've killed me, that it's finally crumbling. I've got PTSD from it, I have insomnia because of that, I have anxiety attacks every night when I fall asleep, and when I do sleep I have nightmares or disturbing dreams and sometimes I'm even semi conscious for them but I can't move, talk or open my eyes, but I feel awake and can hear my dad and stepmum getting up for work and I can understand their conversations while still having a full on nightmare.

I'm reality most of the time people are talking to me I'm considering what they think of me. It's just getting worse as I get older and it's getting harder to hide. 

Anyone else feel this way?",27Aug2019,2
42,"I’ve never used this thing (Reddit) before so I don’t know where this will even be posted but fuck it, here I go.

Since I was young I have always exhibited depressive symptoms; feelings of hopelessness, envy of all my friends, irritability, and so forth. I tried therapy in my mid to late teens and never really felt any result. I did okay in school and despite my emotional problems I got into college and moved out.  At that time I started taking antidepressants and anti anxiety medication and once again never felt any relief for my advancing sadness and tension.

In college I started to drink excessively and smoked weed daily.  Self medication became my main goal and my studies suffered.  I was never content and just got fucked up to get through the day.  I had some success in classes but overall my college years were a disaster. 

I reconnected with a lady from my past and moved in with her.  We were both prescribed many medications and drank daily until we discovered heroin and oxycodone.  From then on, all our energy was spent on dope and pills.  The relationship fell apart after many scary altercations sparked by drugs.  By this time I was about twenty five and I went into the hospital to address my depression and substance abuse.  I went through cycles of using and then crashing and burning and ended up in numerous rehab programs and eventually sober houses.  I almost got a year of clean time but felt no different, relapsed and started over.

Fast forward to today: I’m thirty two years old and just got out of a hospital after a suicide attempt this summer (I purposefully overdosed on Xanax while experiencing a psychotic break), I’m embarrassingly staying with my parents and I have no skills or education that could lead me in a successful direction. Most days all I can do is sleep or chain smoke cigarettes while paralyzed by anxiety.  This is the first thing I’ve written since leaving the hospital and I’m hoping that maybe someone can relate.",27Aug2019,2

45,"I posted one version of this but didn’t like it so I’ll try again.  I’m thirty two years old and I recently got out of the hospital after a suicide attempt during a psychotic episode. For the years leading up to my attempt I was addicted to heroin and an alcoholic self-medicating my paralyzing depression and anxiety. Since I’ve been out I have been on antidepressants and have found no relief. In the past I’ve taken dozens of medications and even underwent IV ketamine treatment trying to find anything that would help.  As the days go on the worse it gets. I can only lay in bed or chain smoke cigarettes, everything else seems impossible.

I’m hoping someone can relate and possibly offer their story.  What helps you get through the days?",27Aug2019,2
46,"Tomorrow I attend my first creative writing class. This will be the first time in three years that I attend a class on college campus, or any class at all, really. When I first tried all that time ago, I was quickly overwhelmed  by my depression, and started sleeping all day, thus missing my classes. I knew that I needed to go back, but my anxiety tied me down. Eventually, I ended up withdrawing. I didn't even make it two months. But now... Now I'm trying again. I'm both excited and afraid. Afraid that I won't be able to keep up, or that my skills aren't what I had though and my friends have told me.

I just wanted to get that out there. I truly hope that all of you out there attending school can find the strength to pull through. I believe in all of you. &lt;3",27Aug2019,1

I wrote this tonight.. please.
“the wind blowing through the darkened room. sound of rain hitting the ground. thunder. lightning. with each thought comes another strike and every strike comes another thought. a thought to strike me down so quickly that I had no more than a second to think. to think about what had happened. what did happen? am I truly okay? why must this happen?”",27Aug2019,1
48,"A friend of mine told me I should talk to somebody about my situation. 

I've always been an anxious kid. My self confidence isnt very high and I have always been on the lower end of self esteem. Recently I've been really concerned about my mental health. 

My mental health took a serious hit during college when I started thinking about who I was, what I was doing with my life, and where I would be in the future. I was working in a lab at the time and the constant anxiety of whether or not I did my experiments right really hurt me. It got so bad that I had to start going to therapy just so I could unload my stress and feel ok. I eventually quit because my anxiety was just too much and I wanted to pursue a different path. During all of this I was smoking weed pretty much daily to cope with my feelings of hopelessness.

Fast forward to today. I've graduated college with a degree in a decent field and I work a low wage job. And I feel absolutely fucking miserable. Today was an especially bad day. Part of it is work anxiety. My boss has a short temper and he is prone to make mean-spirited comments whenever anything goes wrong. This pisses me off but it also makes me hate work and results In me becoming depressed whenever it's time to go to work. The fact that a lot of my friends are successful (med school, tech internships, grad school, etc) just makes me wonder what the hell went wrong or if I was destined to be this way. I should count my blessings considering my family isnt struggling and I graduated from a good school with a degree in a respected field. But at the end of the day I feel like shit and sometimes I wonder if my life will end with me committing suicide.

I feel like the ugly duckling. 

I've never been ""cool."" I've always been the awkward one, the one that never seems to ""get it."" It just feels like I was made to be the one who fails because that's how it seems to end up. Am I just not trying hard enough? Am I just lazy? These are the questions I've been asking myself for a long time and I just don't know the answer or maybe deep down I do but I don't want to admit it. 

All of this anger, self hatred, and general sadness has resulted in me becoming a shitty person. I'm bitter and jealous all the time. See a post about how a friend got into med school? Fuck 'em why couldnt that be me. Sometimes I assume the worst about people. Coworker corrects me on something? Fuck you, you know it all bitch. 

When I'm at work I just want to go the fuck home. My boss says I need to smile more but fuck I just can't. What is there to smile about? The one thing that gets me through the day are my sighs. Sometimes I think they're the only thing empowering me. Every work day seems like a torturous slog with the added risk of getting yelled at by my boss. And on my days off I watch the minutes pass by with increasing dread before I have to go back to work.  I can't even escape through my hobbies because it feels like I don't have any anymore. I used to enjoy things but I don't anymore. Recently I've noticed that I'm spending more and more time just sitting in bed watching YouTube or standing on my balcony smoking weed while watching youtube. 

There are times when I just want to scream at the top of my lungs and break things in a fit of despair. 

I've since cut back on my weed use. I haven't fully quit yet but I hope to stop using someday but unless something changes for the better I don't know if I can. There's something nice about just being able to light up and fucking forget all of my troubles for a couple of hours. I'm lost, drifting through life with a vague idea of where I want to be without any hope of getting there because of my own flaws and the hand nature seems to have dealt me. Why me? 

It gets so fucking dark in here sometimes. 

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.

TL;DR I have anxiety and I worry about my future all the time. My boss is shitty and makes my anxiety worse which leads to a vicious cycle of hating life, my boss yelling at me, and making me hate it more. I have also developed into a bitter fuck who hates everyone and everything.",27Aug2019,3

51,"I’m seventeen(female) almost eighteen in three months and I have a daily struggle of remembering what I say or what I do. 

You could tell me to do something and I will leave to do that something but before I can even do it I forget and have to come back and ask you again. I’ll ask over four or five times what you said to me and continue to forget what you tell me. 

It could be one or two things and I can’t remember within minutes of being told. And forget about you telling me more then three things to do or say cause if I haven’t wrote it down I will in no way remember after only a few minutes. 
 
I’ll always ask the same questions over and over again to people and not remember ever asking you. In a short period of over three hours I could have asked you over five times that question and not remember when I asked you or that I even asked. 

In five hours I could have asked you ten times that one question. And people will respond to me each and every time and I’ll not remember them telling me or me asking after a while.  They will tell me they’ve already told me the answer and tell me it again and tell me I’ve already asked but I won’t remember. 

I don’t remember things I’ve done after a day or two or even a week later and I can’t remember important dates. I could set up an appointment or something like that and after a day or two forget the time and day I made that important for if I don’t write it down. 
Or even what day I myself called to even make the appointment. 

This has been going on for a little under a year and became a problem in my daily life after about two or three months. To the point where my father tried to get me help. 

A therapist he took me to told me as well as my father she thought it would clear away after a few months and that nothing was wrong with me I just thought I was crazy or my father was making me believe I was crazy when I wasn’t.",27Aug2019,4

I can’t remember much of my childhood and things that have happened in this year or before. Like I can’t put a date to a lot of things and can’t relive or retell detail in chronic order of events that have happened in my life. 

Like I can’t recall or retell things that have happened within the year or before this year in a timeline with information in the right order. I either can’t remember a important date or can’t place it with the year it should be in or within the timeline it should be in.

I've been lying to myself pretending that I'm getting better, but the truth of the matter is, I don't feel different at all. My daily mood rating is the same consistent 4. Part of this is because I feel I am too numb to even think about what the hell has hurt me in life. When I wonder about my fear of rejection, I forget where it originated. I forget what even brought me to this program in the first place. When people talk, I can't empathize. I don't care and I really badly want to. I don't remember my bad moods throughout the day and can't feel passionate about the topics I bring up to be discussed. When given good advice, I hardly hear it at all. I can barely concentrate. All I know, is I am fucking numb and can't even pinpoint the millions of issues that brought me here. Also, it kinda feels like murphy's law.

64,"I need some reassurance and if I am crazy then maybe it’s time I file for disability. 

These past two years have been hectic. I went from Medical Assisting to a desk job. I went from direct contact of management, interacting with people face to face on the daily to living in a cubicle i affectionately call the hole and getting passive aggressive emails from management. 

I was helping people and developing meaningful relationships with my patients as an MA. I became invested in their well being and respected the doctor I was working under, and she was a great teacher (this is right out of school). 

I started dating a guy who told me “if you’re still an MA in a year we need to see where we stand”. At the time, it meant that I wasn’t making enough money. So (stupidly) I get a job in a different department where he is at making about four more dollars an hour. At this company, there’s tons of room for development and growth. But I never get good at this job. I live in a cubicle and feel disconnected from humanity. The whole team gets recognized for hard work and I constantly feeling like I’m trying to stay above water. I am gaining weight rapidly and this past year I’ve been hospitalized and out on FMLA twice. Management sucks, mostly because they are all first time managers and play favorites. The office is about politics and I made the stupid mistake of telling them that I was out due to depression and it’s been weird ever sense. I’ve been getting more work than everyone else (for example we did an audit and coincidentally I was the only one who had anyone to audit on the project. I was assigned more states, I get thrown crazy projects, and I am back up for another role while the rest of the team don’t handle any of this.) I was also told, rudely, by our new “team lead” when I made the comment “I’m ready to get the ball rolling” and she says “if your brain will let you”. There are several different cases where things like this have happened and treatment seemed unusual and unfair. 

I go on my honeymoon (this is six months after I took off for fmla) and I get back with a nasty email that threatened I was going to be put on PIP plan (basically a fancy way of saying we’re prolonging termination) for doing something I was advised to do by management. It was in regards to my fmla and time sheet and even felt so off at the time that I made good notes.  For me that was the final straw, and I reported everything to ethics. 

The six months of being back I’ve still been struggling with depression and suicidal ideations and going to work to a place where this crap has been happening. When I got back and read the email and discovered work assignments have been reassigned to where I would have more than everyone else ... again... I had a mental break down. It was yet another passive aggressive email from management and I was feeling so worthless already. 

Now I’m back on FMLA and on suicide watch. I’m in intensive therapy and I know work didn’t do this, and I’m working hard to work through coping skills and getting to the core. But I can’t help but think this is crazy. Like I don’t have a right to be put. I get on Facebook tonight and realized part of the department (people who favorited the team lead) deleted me off of Facebook. Coincidence? Doubt it? 

Just for reference, I’ve always had issues dealing with stress, but never like this. This new job entailed a whole load of different kinds of stress, stuff I barely touched on here, that shouldn’t have even been apart of the job. Medical assisting is stressful, but it’s nothing like this. I’ve been in generally good standing at every previous employer. I was a 3.9 GPA in school, was good at what I did, etc. I know the norm in the past has been that I’m likeable and a good employee but this place has been a total let down. 

I ended up marrying the guy who told me that, but he regrets it to this day. He knows how unhappy I’ve been and supports me going back to MA. 

I just need to know... is this just me? I know suicide is not a normal reaction, but does this seem crappy to anyone else? I have a hard time not being distorted with my depression so to me this is me making a huge deal out of nothing, but if a friend where going through this I would tell her to leave and that she’s worth more than this. 

If you’ve made it this far, then what’s the verdict? I’m crazy?",27Aug2019,2

As of right now, I have severe depression, and an anxiety disorder. I was on Lexapro for a month, and my family doctor changed it to Paroxetine. I was on it for about 3 weeks, before I went off it 3 days ago. That's also right around the time I moved out of my ex's place. She harassed me the entire time and took pictures, recorded me, and ridiculed me. Massive anxiety attack ensued and I punched through a glass display box. I don't know what to do anymore. Meds aren't really working and now I'm going through Paroxetine withdrawal symptoms. The most notable symptom is these electrical jolts randomly throughout my body if I move a bit too quickly. Can't really sleep anymore as that's why my memories run rampant causing more anxiety.

I know its ridiculous, as I got a supportive group of friends and family, but even on meds, I hated myself immensely.

My friends tell me that they'll be pissed if I off'ed myself, but thinking about it now, I don't benefit them in anyway.

I’m kind of worried about my friend. She’s been my best friend for 3 years and I love her so much, but throughout the entire time I’ve known her she’s been EXTREMELY self conscious about everything she does. Her face, her weight, her sporting ability, her smarts - and she is literally perfect in all of these things, in fact she tops the grade and is captain of every sports team we join. She hates everything about her perfect self, and I don’t know how to help with this. My point is, I don’t know how to make her feel confident about herself, and before anyone makes assumptions that she wants attention or something like that, then let me tell you that she doesn’t tell people she’s self-conscious, she hides it and it’s only brought up in small things she says.

I have a friend who has basically chosen to distance herself from me, she knows that I was hurt throughout this whole thing between us. We are no longer speaking as she had asked me for distance and a break from each other and it seems that she keeps doing things, which are seen as to cut me off from her one by one and it is always days or weeks apart. At one point throughout this whole ordeal she has mentioned that she does these things to for me. (which I don't see how anyone can see benefit in constantly doing things that are hurting the other person) because supposedly I was hurt from what she had initially done which was to choose to lessen our friendship.

But I was curious, do you think someone doing these things feels guilt for it? I know last we had an encounter and when she does eventually do these things that I'm saying she is in one of her low moods. Last time we spoke she started saying some pretty self-deprecating things about herself and how she would and never be happy.

She suffers from severe depression, bi-polar and is on the spectrum of autism however she hasn't gotten a proper diagnosis from what I know of.

81,"People often ignore it, but emotional health is a crucial part of the overall well-being. Being emotionally healthy can help one with controlling their feelings, thoughts, and most importantly behaviors. It provides room for thinking clearly, which leads to healthy coping mechanisms in case of challenges and difficulties. An emotionally aware person has a better chance of bouncing back from drastic setbacks than someone who does not know what to do with their feelings.

Conquering your emotional health does not mean that you will never be sad again. It is not magic. Instead, it is more about knowing your emotions and how to deal with them irrespective of their nature. It will aid you in managing your positive as well as negative emotions. A person who is emotionally aware will be able to identify when stress, anger, or even ecstasy overwhelm them. They will know when these emotions are too much to handle and when it is time to seek a doctor’s help.

 

While not many people practice it, the good news is emotional health is a skill that anyone can learn. Here are a few ways you can learn to maintain and improve your emotional health:

* **Identify Your Emotions And Reactions:** Find out what makes you angry, frustrated, and sad in general then address those issues and/or change the situations for better.
* **Express Well**: Harboring [negative feelings](https://htv.com.pk/mind-body/strategies-deal-negative-people) inside when a situation or someone’s behavior bothers you can be extremely toxic for your emotional well-being. It will give you stress and can create unnecessary problems for your relations with others. It is better to communicate your feelings towards the person in question.
* **Ponder Before You Indulge**: Instead of just acting out of impulse, give a thought to what you are about to do. Be calm and consider the consequences of acting rashly. There is no point in doing something that you will regret later.
* **Manage Stress**: This is a vital step towards better [emotional health](https://htv.com.pk/mind-body/6-things-emotionally-strong-people-not). Transform the situations that give you stress. Various relaxation methods can help you cope with stress, such as meditation, deep breathing, and exercise.
* **Balance Life**: In order to avoid overwhelming yourself and your emotions, always strive for a balance between work and rest. Save time for activities that you enjoy. Focus on the positive side of life.
* **Maintain Physical Health**: Your [physical health](https://htv.com.pk/news/physical-exercise-alone-really-not-enough-boost-brain-health) is important. You might already know that deteriorating emotional health affects physical health as well, leading to diseases such as depression, heart condition, [diabetes](https://htv.com.pk/health/top-7-superfoods-diabetes), and high blood pressure. However, bad physical health can mess up your emotions as well. Therefore, you must take proper care of yourself physically by getting sufficient sleep and eating healthy. Also, refrain from abusing alcohol and drugs.
* **Connect With Others**: Being social animals, humans crave company. Connecting with people and socializing will nourish your emotions as well. Make sure to choose your connections carefully. The moment you realize the other person is toxic and negative, try to exclude yourself from their company if you can’t help with their situation.
* **Find Meaning**: One of the biggest reasons behind the ever-increasing suicide rate is a lack of meaning in life. Do yourself a favor and find a purpose — something that is important to you. Strive for it.
* **Stay positive**: Lastly, try to [stay positive](https://htv.com.pk/mind-body/how-positive-thoughts-lead-to-positive-life). Always!

83,"There's quite a few types of hallucinations but no matter how hard I've looked, I find little to no evidence of minds eye hallucinations.

When I was really young, I always remember it being really hard for me to control my thoughts. I never had any imaginary friends because it took a lot of energy and focus to make them do what I want, if I didn't put in the effort they would glitch, distort and run around and distroy things or try to hurt me. Every time I'd close my eyes to sleep, my imagination would take me of to a world of distortion. I would be pulled around, sucked up into large, rectangular metal vacuums, I would be cloned, distorted and covered with spiders. I'd try to fly around and do what I want but there was something so incredibly hard about being autonomous because the forces of chaos and distortion always would distroy my free will in my mind. Half of all my mental energy went into controlling my thoughts. I didn't want that to leak into the physical world. It seemed the more intricate my thoughts were, the more unstable they'd get, it felt like my mind was a shitty video game and doing things too fast would cause glitching and crashing. I would use this crashing problem for when I was in really boring dreams, I would cause everything to move at once, causing everything to crash and it would turn into a short nightmare, scaring me and finally waking me up.

For a while this problem wasn't as bad, probably because I started thinking in 2D instead of 3D, which seems to be an incredibly unstable thinking realm/format.

When I was 11-12, I had horrible insomni, crippling anxiety, was starting to experience arousal and other powerful emotions and was recently diagnosed with hashimotos, I also started experimenting with pot which probably all contributed to what happened to me.

Every day I would hallucinate about getting raped. I'm still not sure if I should classify this as an intrusive thought or hallucination but I think just calling it an ""intrusive thought"" would be a huge understatement, despite the fact these visions were not based in any senses. Unlike the episodes I had when I was younger, instead of it just being a glitch, the imaginary ""friend"" would stay intact and have its own personality that would keep coming back every day to torment me. I could sense what entity was visiting me, some of my OCs at the time would apear and they all had different auras.

There was a male aura. He'd try to force his cock down my throat, fuck me and impregnate me. My own mind did things to me that my young mind couldn't comprehend. There's 0 evidence that I was ever actually abused by a real person but if I was, I wouldn't be surprised. He would almost always take the form of cartoon characters, I'd always refer to his as ""it"" because referring to the character name would give me anxiety. It took me 2 years after this problem became less prevalent to look at a cartoon again and not get unbearable anxiety. I always had to look away if any cartoons that I saw in my intrusive thought, hallucination things was on. 

Even now these things fuck with me, 4 months ago, I hallucinated about one of the girls from the load house. I don't know their names but it was the lesbian one that plays guitar, she looked a lot older than in the show or at least was a lot taller and she was completely naked, she would wrap herself around my legs and would bined to them, making it impossible to get her off. Near the end of the episode, a huge chunk of her face turned into a giant gaping hole/mouth with sharp razor teeth and she took a bite out of my neck while tearing into my chest with her claws, she turned into an unrecognizable monstrosity. I haven't been able to even look a picture from the show for 3 months. I'm better now, as long as a clip from the loud house doesn't have the character I hallucinated about in it, then I can watch it a little.

I think the thing that makes these things so horrifying is the fact that it's a thought and not a hallucination, but acts exactly like a hallucination, so you feel like there's something personally wrong with you for thinking such horrible thoughts. I still feel like these episodes shouldn't be THIS horrifying to me though.

Does this have a name? What am I experiencing? I've only been able to find a few forums with people sharing their experiences with intrusive thought hallucinations but none have any conclusion. Some say it's psychosis, some say it's anxiety. I just want to know what's wrong with me. I'll give more information tomorrow, it's 2 am right now.

Tldr: I've been experiencing thought hallucinations, difficulty controlling my thoughts and imagination and getting them to do what I want all my life and it's affecting me emotionally. I want to know why.",27Aug2019,2

When I was about 8 years old I was diagnosed with ADHD. Over the past 16 years I have been on Ritalin occasionally for my concentration issues. Currently I take 40mg Modified Release Ritalin.

I have always been rather afraid of feeling sick (nausea) / throwing up. A few years ago I somehow developed a Generalized Anxiety Disorder about this for which I now take 40mg Seroxat (SSRI).

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

For a pretty long time now I don't feel connected to reality. It's difficult for me to explain; but I'll try.

When I was young I always felt 'clear' in my head. I noticed everything in my surroundings and felt real. When I got older I sometimes had these moments of fog in my head where I didn't feel connected to reality and like everything I did was automatic without my brain being in my control. These moments grew in occurrence until it was all I could remember. For the last 5 to 10 years I am in a constant state of this foggy feeling where I feel no connection to my surroundings and everything feels surreal. I like to compare it to being tipsy and very tired - although I can't really put in words the 'disconnected' feeling.

I feel as if this foggy / disconnected feeling decreases my cognitive functioning. My memory sucks, I often lose my train of thoughts and blank out in a conversation.

I can't really remember much about when I was young. When I try to remember something that happened in the near past it feels more like remembering facts than memories.

As nothing feels real I don't feel the importance of things. It's like I know what I should feel in (social) situations, but since I don't feel it I fake it.

You know those moments where you kind of 'zone out' whilst driving and all of a sudden 'wake up' and wonder what you were thinking about the past few seconds / minutes? I hope (and fear) I will one day also 'wake up' / reconnect to reality and not really remember this foggy present.

Very occasionally (about once a year?) I feel real again for a minute. These moments keep me certain that I'm not just imagining this and I really shouldn't be feeling how I feel now. The last time I felt /really/ clear is about 1 or 2 years ago when I was at the cinema with my girlfriend. All of a sudden I actually noticed the entire crowd sitting in front of us and /really/ felt like I was physically part of this world. Sometimes I feel semi-clear which makes me feel like I (for example) hear the voice of my girlfriend for the first time in a long while. Actually 'feel' like I'm having a conversation with her instead of faking 100% of what I know is expected of me as a person in a conversation.

ive struggled with depression for so long. the first wave came when i was in about 3rd grade. i attributed a lot of it to the fact that growing up i was the smallest (11 years apart) and felt very alone. aside from that i spent a lot of my time with my mother who at the time was dealing with a brain tumor. between my frequent crying, the mood swings it was a lot for my parents to take in. being the kind that dont ""believe"" in therapy, i wasnt able to get help until about 5th grade when, not only did i get alcohol poisoning at school but i confessed to my sister i was a lesbian (my sexualitys  not really what this is about). truth is i dont know why i was crying. it made sense that i was dissapointing people but not how or why. just that i was this burden. i remember during this time my mom asking me things like ""hunny the bathrooms ready are you going to shower"" and me just breaking down in tears. but as i mentioned earlier i discovered quite early on how alcohol can make you feel. before i got alcohol poisoning i had this bad habit of sneaking my dads beer. one at a time i would drink and say things like ""(sister), im hurt that you left me with mom went she was sick. you had school and it wasnt your fault but i needed you"" and things like ""(mom) , im mad at for telling me when i was too young to even visit you in the hospital that you were going to die and i needed to grow up. it wasnt fair"". eventually the habbit became a problem and i was getting kicked out of schools left and right for substance abuse. but i grew up and i stopped and eventually  i wasnt drinking to communicate honestly with myself or anyone, it became just the average highschool experience. during this time i was seeing several therapists, counselors and taking medication.
i mentioned in 22 now so ill catch you up to where im at. i moved out of my parents house and into this relationship with a wonderful woman. i havent had any bad hiccups with alcohol but recently i feel everything is spiraling backwards. the last couple times i went out drinkkng with my girlfriend i drank so much i cried and hurt myself pretty bad. ive had on and off experiences with self harm and im not proud of it. i have a problem with communicating what i feel. that much is clear to me. but this emptiness is back and i feel it so much harder now. i feel alone when im surrounded. i feel like im unable to partake or be a part of something. my relationship is struggling. im scared to cry in front of her cause.. it happens a lot. i get annoyed with myself for my irrational thoughts and my "" neediness"". i cry just telling her i love her. i feel im on a clock... and i feel like im running out of time. im running out of time to make it up to my parents for having to take me to AA and NA meetings in middleschool. im running out of time to get my degree and go back to school. im running out of time to be that ... healthy individual that i want to be. i feel this clock partly  because of my parents. people dont notice gradual change, but i left home 2 years ago and in that time ive watched my parents shrink in size, i watched new wrinkles form, ive watched my dad develop a limp... and im so terrified. reddit ive made many mistakes. and i feel like my clock to make up for them is getting louder and louder. im consumed with this idea that im not gonna make it. that my life, and i dont have the will to do this myself please understand that, is going to be cut short. i feel like im not gonna make it. that somethings gonna happen. and with this feeling i feel like i NEED to fix it. i NEED to feel like you see me as a good person. i want to be remembered as a good person.. i want to be strong. i want people to understand that i was there for them and that even though i was sad i was good. i listened and i helped. that i grew up and left home and tried to be better. ive been trying so damm hard. but i have it firm in my head that everything i love will go away before they realize this. i feel so stuck. i feel insecure at times that i simultaneously feel is an inappropriate time to feel better insecure. i just want someone to believe me when i say that i love them. because i do. i love each and every one of you. for your words. for your community. and for the love that was indirectly let in to my heart with every ""its going to be okay"". thank you for your time. im sorry if this is long or didn't make sense. im sorry.",27Aug2019,1
93,"This is serious. I'm 16 year old guy and everything in my life has been getting really hard. I didnt go to school for over two weeks and ive been skipping classes all year. Im on anti depressants which are Fluoxetine 20 ml tablets. I dont think its been helping, in 3 days it will be 3 months of me taking the meds and everything has been getting worst this year. Early this year i tried to kill myself. I had a fight with my mum about bullshit and i couldn't explain why i was depressed and she didn't understand it and we argued about it and she told me i either had to tell her why i was depressed which i don't have a real reason i guess or i have to get out of her life. I asked her if she was serious as she pushed me closer to the door and she was serious. I told her goodbye and i loved her and i walked out in the middle of the night in Australia country town without socks or shoes. I walked for about 45 mins maybe 5 mins away from the bridge that i was going to jump off and the police stopped me. I didn't have a choice they offered me an ambulance but i was freezing and just in a horrible place. My feet were killing me because i had to step on so many rocks and prickles and they were BLACK from the road. The police kept trying to talk to me as they drove me to a hospital but they couldn't hear what i was saying and that made me feel like such shit. I got to the hospital and got sat in a room and turned on the tv there and i was there for maybe 15 mins and then my mum and sister walked in. They both started to yell at me and call me an idiot for doing this shit and said it was all of attention which really hurt me and i didnt know what to do. so i kept arguing with them and just had a bad time. After a while they ended up leaving and i got put into a hospital room which was so bad, i was alone and had no one to talk to. I turned on the TV and fell asleep. in the morning i got some food and i asked a nurse for there phone to call my mum and she let me but she needed her phone back quickly. I called my mums number and she was pissed off and was getting dressed i told her she can come to the hospital now. Then she gave it to my adopted little cousin and he was crushed and didn't even want to talk to me which hurt me but i understood. then my uncle took the phone ( his only 11 months older then me ) he said i have no idea what i just did and that i was a fucking idiot for doing it. it really hurt me inside but oh well shit happens i guess. Few hours later my mum came in and a doctor came in and she asked if we could go home but before i go home i needed to be tested to see if im okay going home. When the doctor left my mum told me i had to lie to them if i wanted to go home so i did. i told them it was just all of a fuck up and shit. it was a bad idea lying to them but i felt so unsafe and so uncomfortable so i lied.

 After a while my sister had to drive me into school and we ended up fighting about some shit and my anger issues were bad so i walked off and she told me she wouldn't drive me to school so i said fuck it and i started to walk there. This killed my legs and feet. It took me about an hour and a half to get to school. I went into the councilors room and i talked to her. I started to trust her and i told her about me being in hospital and how i wanted to die. Everything was okay for about 4 days then she wanted to interview me and i said i was very un happy and i wanted to die. She said she wouldn't call the police or ambulance if i told her the truth. which i did. she still called the police and ambulance, i was very mad. when they came to the school i lied to them and i just kept saying im okay but the councilor told them id say that because i told her about lying to the doctors. shit was horrible with my mum keep texting me and calling me while they were talking to me it was killing me. my mum had to leave work which she is a boss there so it made her even more mad. everything was shit. i got there and they didnt put me on meds straight away since im only 16. they told me i should go to headspace which you can google. so i did i went there after a while i was in there for about 2 hours and they were really pissing me off and she kept saying if im uncomfortable with her i can have someone new which is fair BUT she said it every other sentence which really made me feel unwanted. shit was so bad so i ended up leaving. I told my doctor about it and then i got set up with a specialist who had to travel a few hours to come see me. i talked to him but i didnt really tell him much about my depression it was mostly just my anxiety and i found out i have ASPD ( anti social personality disorder ) which i guess its fine i have always hated people so it didnt shock me. Thoughout all of this ive had an amazing girlfriend that i love a lot its been just over 7 months of dating its been a good time with ups and downs. she is struggling with her depression and anxiety too but we always seem to make each other feel better.

97,"Hello
I have a history of mental illness dating back to 1999, when I had a burn out which destroyed my medical career, cutting it short just befor earning my postgrad degree. A major depression ensued, with so much comorbidity that it was difficult to establish a diagnosis. I finally was treated as BPD, and after 2 - 3 years (of deep darkness, several meds and hours and hours of therapy) I started to feel better. A couple years later (15 years ago) I met a guy from overseas, fell madly in love and moved with him across the pond because he had a good job, and I had nothing left. I'm an only child, and left my parents behind, although I visited as often as I could.

Because I was in my mid-30s, we decided to start a family ASAP, so I had the first kid with 35, the second with 37.
I decided to stay at home, in part because it was important to me that my kids learn my mother language (not English, as you probably noticed), and also because I didn't want to start all over again with 2 small kids. Not to mention, I was learning the language of my current country (not English neither, &lt;sob&gt;)

My oldest child has ADHD. He's been a handful since Kindergarten. He needs a lot of support and attention. He functions very well with the adequate support, but he needs it. My youngest has a lot of ADHD traits, so also a handful, but doesn't need treatment.

In the last 4 years: I lost my Mum to cancer, my FIL to an accident, moved house, got stuck with a buyer who owes me A LOT of money from the sale of a property I inherited, but I can't make him pay, so I will have to bring him to court. My marriage is all but broken, but I can't divorce because we just bought a house (complicated story, not relevant). Then I lost my Dad 2 months ago. And today, I received the news that this country (unlike most countries in the world, who don't even recognize foreign postgrad degrees) REQUIRES me to have a degree fully recognized in order to practice. My doctor's degree on its own is useless. And I nearly finished my postgrad, I have all certificates to prove my experience, but no. I didn't do the final exam, so, go home. (As a side note, the area where I live has 0 (null, nada) paediatricians. And I'm nearly, practically fully qualified, except for the bloody signed piece of paper.

I'm near the middle age. I am an overqualified stay at home piece of failure. My kids are lovely, and the only reason I get up every morning, but one day they will grow up and leave and I don't know what the fuck am I gonna do.

I hit my peak where I thought I was at my worst after some reflection this past year around age 21. I was closing myself off from the world by just staying in my room after work. Either drinking. Playing games, or drinking. But in the last 6 months I've been seeing a therapist on and off on my issues and thought patterns. Things have changed and I think they are in a good way but I'm not sure. I've been more talkative at work, not a whole lot but I find it a bit easier to start and carry a conversation once a while. I've actually went out to six flags with 2 coworkers this weekend after actually making plans with them. I've been on and off the gym (trying to get my body back in shape but its hard to stay motivated), moved into a new apartment with my gf, and have a better connection with my family. Started college again and doing pretty well. But I still feel like nothing I do is good enough. As if I need to keep doing more. I still think about how I hate my life and wish it would end. I do all the things my therapists suggest and I do and practice, but it all seems
..fake? As if I'm just faking it all to blend in more but I still feel like wanting to die. What's wrong with me?  Any tips or stories to share relating?

101,"I used to feel compelled to recover quickly because of the stigma of depression. I used to be very dependent on meds. As it worked on me, I thought it was the only solution to my depression. And because I was relying solely on meds, I thought I was inherently vulnerable and flawed.

However, I noticed some changes when I picked up poetry again in my 20s. As I wrote, I noticed that I was exploring different emotions in my writing - anger, sadness, resentment. I found courage to speak about my repressed feelings, and that gave me courage to heal.

I realised that healing is not a project that I need to rush to complete. There are no deadlines. I can take my time to heal and regression - it's normal. Sometimes it pours and the road gets slippery so we fall again.

I'll love to share my book with you. It's a compilation of what I've learned through depression and recovery. I hope it offers you some hope. 

I will like to share what I've written with you: https://www.choogeraldine.com/index.php/download/twnwy-pdf/

If you have any feedback, I'll love to hear it as well.

""It is okay to...

have dreams larger than your palms
believe that the light will always guide you home
climb walls that crumble
turn back
begin again""

102,"I've had something's said to me recently by three of the most important people in my life about my mental health and I don't know how to process them.

Best friend: 'One of these days I'll talk to you and you'll actually be happy about something 🙄'

Parent: [trying to discuss mental health over a beer] 'Shhh people can hear you, they don't want their nice day ruined with your negativity'

Boyfriend: 'You really need to get over yourself, the world isn't out to get you. I'm not out to get you, you need to stop thinking everything is about you'

Around 3-5 years ago I was in a rough situation in life. Plenty of depression, anxiety and hate bottled up throughout the years. This folder contains mostly screenshots of important talks with my friends about these things. It's really ugly, ""just letting it out"" kind of hate and unfiltered violent talk towards people and life itself. There are also some quotes and a video of me setting my arm on fire. Good ol' times.  


I am in a completely different situation in life now. I am feeling a lot better, starting studying next month and taking care of a doggo. This folder still has great value to me and it reminds me of what happens if I don't take care of my mental health, if I don't sleep enough or have healthy ways to deal with anger. It also makes me proud in some weird way, because i did beat all that. Its in the past. I still wish to keep that part of myself to myself, even from my loved ones.

I’m just standing there at work thinking “Please stop, please” and I sometimes am concerned that maybe other people hear “Danny” too.

He claims she's communicating with him via ""subjective mesages on her instagram posts"" and that every one of them is a direct reference to him because of shit he posts on his instagram. Shes using the colors in her art that I use as well, I post shit about the sun and look, she painted the sun in this picture, she knows I'm a pilot so that's why she drew this bird, etc... I thought he was insane and I confronted him on the fact that be belives that this woman wants to marry and have a baby with him (yes, he said that) despite the fact of never having actually met her, when I asked him how many times he has had contact with her he said he only actually saw her five times... as a spectator on her concerts and that in those concerts while she was on stage she eyed him and made communicating gestures and other stuff that according to him only they could understand in their strange form of communication. Erotomania is the closest term I found to his behavior. I worry about him because he has become distant from our parents since he was caight smoking weed, (we are a mexican family with very conservative parents) and I really don't want him to spiral into madness or something.

If anybody has dealt with this or knows how somebody got through this I would appreciate any imput, I thought about getting him into therapy but I fear that might be futile since he's 100% convinced in his conviction so he will reject the idea entirely.

He feels as if his family treats him like a kid (he's 19) and takes stuff away from him when he doesn't do tasks exactly when told. I feel as if this drives from it a bit and being far away I'm not sure how to aid that. Another thing I'll bring up is, he can very angry and very quickly but mainly it's over video games. That anger has made him hurt himself by punching his desk and wanting to scream at the top of his lungs, while doing such telling me to leave him alone. That anger sometimes will slowly turn into self-hate and him getting mad at himself for not doing good or not being the best.. which brings the silent treatment. Yesterday he said quite some hurtful things to me ""I don't need you anyway"" or ""I don't want your help, I don't care about you"" and it hurt badly. However I know it was due to a mixture of anger/sadness and his demons taking over so I forgave him quickly. When those three things are gone, he's so happy and excited about everything and the time we get to spend together. He's a real sweetheart but he pushes people away quickly when his personality starts to fade under all that emotion.   


He is afraid of opening up or getting extremely close to anyone for the fact he believes they won't accept him, abandon him, hate him or he'll end up alone. He's not open with me, he is with his family as far as I can tell however I don't believe they know of these recent events. I'm not someone who gives up easily especially when I care so much about a person and know he deserves happiness, adventure, love, friends because he is truly caring.  Just a young smart man with inner demons.

111,"Seriously, if there is anything you are struggeling with, what ever it is, getting help is smart. 

I used to think I had to solve my problems on my own, I even thought that no one could help me. Resulting in me throwing away a year of my life to needles struggeling. Some of my experiances:

* I was struggeling with some mental health things, but I didn't want to tell anyone about it. I didn't want my parents to know because I was afraid they would be dissapointed in me. And I didn't think my problems where 'bad enough' to get profecinal help. I was wrong about both these things. My parents helped me to find profecinal help, and I am doing so much better now. 
* I have been struggeling to get a job for a while now. I looked on the internet if there was any type of help I could get from my local goverment. At first I only found that there was help for people whit disabilitys, and sinds I don't have a disability, I just gave up on that. But my mom told me to just make an appointment there and see what happens. So I did, and even though they could not help me, they referd me to an organisation that gives free advise on finding work and other things. And though I don't have a job jet, they have given me some realy good advise already.

Now, I know that finding help can be difficult depending on what country you live in, but there is no harm in trying. There are online websites and chats to. If an offical or profecinal tells you they can't help you, ask them to refer you to someone that can, keep looking online. Try whatever you need to try to get where you want to be. If asking for help gets you there soner, than that is the smartest thing to do.

If anyone tries to tell you asking for help is weak or not smart or anything, consider this: 

2 people break their leg, person 1 goes to the docter and gets a cast, so their leg can heal properly. Person 2 does not go to the docter because they are tough and want to deal with it themselfs. now would you say person 1 is weak? or would you say person 2 is stupid?",27Aug2019,6

The first time I went was when I was 13 and git diagnosed with depression after a suicide attempt- and I eventually stopped treatment. The next time I went to therapy was last year where I went for three months. My friend and I both encountered that these therapists have negated telling us anything related to diagnosis because 'it may hinder improvement'. There is some logic behind it, since I agree that some people may use their diagnosis as a way to stop growth or excuse bad habits- but deying diagnosis doesn't seem all too ethical for me. Obtaining a diagnosis can be extremely relieving for those suffering from mental ailments, it can make a person learn more abiut their condition and ways ti help themselves.

so, i was wondering earlier, what really qualifies as trauma?

when i was in seventh grade, i’m a freshman now, so it’s been two years, multiple of my friends experienced sexual harassment from my vice principal that school year, and the other day i had another nightmare about it where i had to watch something happen to my friends. 

it got me thinking, can trauma arise from something that didn’t happen to you, but to people you were close to and cared for, that left you feeling helpless as you just had to watch and do nothing? because we always see trauma as something that results from something happening TO you, but if someone watched it happen and couldn’t do anything but watch, could that also result in trauma?

115,"Hello,

As far as I remember, I've always been a bad sleeper. I remember being a 6-9 years old kid and struggling so badly with insomnia, disrupted sleep, nightmares and sleep paralysis that I had this ritual where I'd recite every night a small prayer to literally beg to God to have a good night.

Things did not markedly improve with time. I'm 27 years old now, I don't experience sleep paralysis anymore and I only occasionally have periods of insomnia. But I keep on having nightmares every other night and I don't sleep a lot because falling back asleep after 6am is almost inevitably a guarantee of having a nightmare. 

It gets me frustrated because I have a very healthy lifestyle (eating well, regular physical activity, regular sleeping schedule, no alcohol, no drugs, no TV etc) but what's the point if I can't rest properly cause I'm plagued with nightmares?

I wish I could stop these nightmares or at least reduce the amount of them. Can anybody help me with that?

Few complementary elements: 

- I don't have fantasy dreams. All of my dreams are based on reality. I don't dream of monsters and whatnot. I only dream of real life situations albeit generally unpleasant and uncommon ones. Regular themes include: getting lost, losing my things, getting drugged, losing my eyesight. I suppose the common denominator is losing control.

- I've read a couple of years ago that recurrent nightmares can be a lifelong symptom of PTSD, and I did in fact experience many years of child abuse. But I'm pretty sure I was a bad sleeper before the abuse started. Also, I'm looking for a solution to my nightmares, not just theories about the cause.

Envision a future where children and their parents, and their teachers, and their doctors, all believe there is a newer and safer method than drugs–hooking up electrodes to the foreheads of kids to “stimulate” their frontal lobes every night. Imagine millions of children enduring this stigma, this humiliation, this lie about being helped, the demoralization of being treated like a broken machine with no self-determination, and the enormous risk of long-term harm to the brain. 

The implementation of this abuse has already begun with the FDA’s approval of the Monarch machine, which hooks up a TNS unit to the forehead of children labelled ADHD in order to “stimulate” (cause dysfunction in) their frontal lobes. In an act of utter disregard for the children of America and the world, the FDA approved this Monarch device based on a mere four weeks of testing on about 30 children, which will inevitably lead to innumerable children being exposed to it for months and years at a time, all of them as guinea pigs. 

And that’s only the beginning. The same or similar units are being tested on anxiety, depression, PTSD, and epilepsy.

Giving neurotoxic drugs to children is bad enough.  Dr. Breggin continues to write and to lecture about it, and to talk about it on his YouTube channel.  We don’t want to imagine how bad a few weeks or months on the Monarch electrical machine will turn out to be for children, but it could be even worse than psychiatric medications. The marketing is just starting and could end up with millions of children hooked up to these lobotomy-like machines. We want to stop it. Now.

Unless I pre-plan for a upcoming conversation it takes me longer to talk about exactly what I am thinking. I already know what I am going to say; but when I try  to speak it is very fragmented.

 For instance, in a discussion I will say a couple sentences... then I will pause for about 5 seconds to think about what I'm trying to say... then continue where I left off... then pause again to think of what to say next. I use ""Um"" and ""uh"" to fill in the long pauses as well. I noticed this when I took a video of me trying to discuss a topic and it took way longer than it should of when I was talking. I'd say my thought process is quick, but it's a different story when talking; it's very slow and methodical like.

What do you think this might be? Do you think reading some more books would help the rate of my speech?",27Aug2019,3
129,"Hello, world. I'm making this post to give people hope.

I'm sure that everyone has suffered from suicidal thoughts at one time or another. I know I have. But I will never act on them. Here's why.

It devastates the people around you who feel like they could have helped. They live in never ending guilt of what could have been and feel like the death was their fault. I know a couple of people who I used to idolize ( no one who commits suicide should be idolized) who, they did it and, even though I didn't know them, it hurts me because I feel like ""they could have done so much more"" Aaron Swartz, capital steez, and Kurt Cobain are all people who I used to idolize who committed suicide, and it still hurts me to this day.

Another reason why you should never commit suicide is because, believe it or not, alot of thought was put into this life that you have right now, from the spirits on the other side who would be very dissapointed if you had did that. I read about it in a book called ""Destiny Of Souls"". You should read it. 

Another reason why you should never commit suicide is because things can always get better. Always. Even if you lose an arm, a leg, your eyesight, there's still a lot of life left in you 💓💓💓

So a couple weeks back I had two anxiety attacks, first time in my life, I got over them pretty quickly and thought that was over. Recently though I started feeling like my vision was getting weird, I see lights in a weird way and I can’t really focus objects that are at a distance, more so than usual. I checked blood and did an eye test and both returned perfect, I don’t know if this vision thing is just anxiety fucking with me and my brain making me believe I see weird or what else. Worst part is I’m going to Japan in a week, I’ve always wanted to go and I just want to enjoy it as much as possible and I don’t want this to be in the way and make me go “wait, why can’t I see normally?”.

138,"TLDR; I've been extremely upset about the literal stupidest thing for months now. I can't change it, so it's not like crying about this is going to help anybody. I'm a fourteen year old, so teenage angst makes sense. Should I just try to stop overreacting or ya know, talk to my therapist about it?

(If you say this isn't a stupid thing to be upset about I'm gonna fight you, because it is stupid and I'm a spoiled white boy baby and other people have real problems Jesus Christ Salem)

So, backstory. A few months ago, in February, I got all my band merch for Set it Off's new album, Midnight. There was one problem. My parents had gotten me smalls, which... My hands are shaking thinking of it. Smalls fit me, but they fit me body con, and as a trans guy who also happens to have a lot of body image issues accentuating my hips, breasts, and stomach is not something I exactly want. They did not ask what size I want, or even what size I am, they just got me smalls. This all could have been avoided if they just ASKED me. Which I assume is normal if you're getting someone clothes for Christmas (it arrived in February because that's when the album dropped.)

Whenever I see my merch I feel like crying (and I usually do,) out of anger or sadness or whatever this is. I also commonly bang my fists against my head until I'm too dizzy to feel things because the emotion I feel over something so STUPID is so overwhelming. I am a spoiled, upper-middle class, white boy crying because oh dear, even though the clothes fit me they don't fit me ""the right way"". Thinking about the clothing, ESPECIALLY the sweatshirt (who, ever, in the history of sweatshirts, don't upsize sweatshirts? THEYRE SO UNCOMFORTABLE IF THEY FIT YOU SO CLOSELY! It makes me feel claustrophobic) makes me want to tear my hair out and scratch my face off and kick and scream and Jesus Christ why am I like this!? I feel sick right now.

I have been diagnosed with adhd, depression, and anxiety. I don't want to tell my parents how I feel because I feel like it's so stupid. And I'm not talking to or seeing them at the moment (since they got CPS called on them but whatever,) but this happened before then. Shouldn't I just stop being a spoiled fucking brat and get over this shit? It happened six months ago! This isn't the only thing. I get so upset if somebody doesn't get me the exact thing I wanted, even though I usually never specify what I want. But I usually get over it within a month if I don't think about it at all! Why the hell do I still have mental breakdowns everytime I see that stupid sIZE SMALL SWEATSHIRT DEAR GOD WHY WOULD YOU— anyway is this normal teenage angst fellas or should I mention this in therapy? Because I have a long list of things I want to mention in therapy (I also have breakdowns whenever I have to do the dishes ???) and one more thing is so annoying.


Unnecessary paragraph apologizing for how shitty I explained and organized things:

Sorry this is so cluttered, I'm shaking because I'm thinking about it and I want to rant about how you always upsize band merch, and you always upsize clothing for a thirteen year old because they're still going to grow, and I've never liked body conforming clothing, and did they ask me what size I am? I can't remember but I don't think they did. Sorry. I can never make anything short and nice. ALSO CPS did not take me away my parents are divorced and the parents I'm talking about are my Dad and step-mom. I'm staying at my mom's my broskis.",27Aug2019,2
139,"I was diagnosed with depression at age 14. I'll be 45 in a month. My most recent diagnosis is unspecified depressive disorder. It's not major depressive or minor depressive, but runs the gamut between both. I also have PTSD and likely (though never diagnosed) RAD.

I like to think of it as a volume knob. When it's bad enough that I am actively ideating and making plans to kill myself,  it's at a 10. On ""1"" days, I have an underlying sadness, but I laugh, joke around, and have fun. 

I'd say on average, I operate at volume 2 or 3, depending on my stress level.

I figured that a psychiatrist would help me unlock my full potential so that I could feel like myself for once. It was awful. It was everything my mother told me about. I told her a story about a week I had where I was blissfully happy and felt like I was on cloud 9 and the next week I was really down on my luck and couldn't leave bed. She immediately chalked it up as bipolar disorder. I was hoping to get a diagnosis for ADHD, which I did, but my problem is that she did it so quickly with little information both diagnoses feel illegitimate. She prescribed me olanzapine/zyprexa, and I asked her if it was possible to recover from mental disorders without it. She told me without it my condition will only get worse. Fuck man, i went to her for help maybe see about joining a support group but all she wants to do is but a name on shit and pump me full of meds. She didn't care in the least bit about my progress with violence and self-hate. Maybe I wanted a support group reccomendation or someone to actually care.

148,"I work in a charity shop.  A an older man came in, and after buying some items, he started telling me I had stolen his money. He didn’t look angry, more confused and kind of scared, but he did then turn around, scream and punch the air really hard. He did that a couple more times while I looked around the shop floor to make sure he hadn’t lost it, and he eventually left. He just came in again and was acting similarly, and asked me quite aggressively where I live. I was a little scared, but I’m more worried that this man should be looked after by someone who could help manage his mental health, as I’m pretty sure he has schizophrenia. Is there anything I can do about alerting an organisation or something? I don’t have any details on him, and I’d have to wait for him to come into the store again to do anything. Is there some way I can help him get help?",27Aug2019,0
149,"I originally posted this on another subreddit but it feels kinda abandoned. I will try to trim the technical questions, ignore them if something slips by.

 

His left leg was amputated below the knee and there's an ongoing struggle to save the right one. Last week he was discharged from the hospital and is currently recovering at my place. He had several other injuries and wont be able to put any weight on his right foot for a while, so currently he's mostly bedridden and we hired a live in caregiver. What worries me the most is his mental state. I've known him since forever and he's always been a bit weird when it comes to coping. On the outside, he's extremely positive, happy go lucky and all that but he usually ignores the issues or bottles it all up until he implodes over something minor. For example, last year he was pushed out of the company he co-founded but all was peachy until his toaster broke and he had a full blown panic attack over that. Once that was out of his system, he started being proactive about the situation. When he finally breaks down, he calls me if I'm not around, so yeah, he's always been emotionally dependent on me. Now he seems completely unfazed, nothing seems to irritate or frustrate him. He had a girlfriend, they were together for almost 3 years and she dropped all his stuff at my place while he was still in surgery. She didn't even contact me, a neighbor called to tell me there are garbage bags and boxes outside my gate. He didn't even ask why she hasn't come to visit him, I was dreading having to tell him. His reaction- eh, whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

As I said, he lost a leg, might lose the other one too and he acts like nothing happened. Shitting in a bedpan and getting sponge baths for months would probably drive most people crazy, but not him. I minored in psychology and I can tell that since the accident, when he's happy, he's manic. The other day we were going to an appointment and he bit my ass, said it was the perk of being in a wheelchair. We laughed about it but he no longer laughs with his eyes. Knowing how he copes, I made him talk to someone while he was barely woken up. A therapist comes over once a week and apparently, he's coping incredibly well and should try public speaking. Meanwhile, I'm on pins and needles, just waiting for him to fall apart. I try to keep a positive environment and follow his lead. Sometimes he wants to talk and hype about the future and the next steps, sometimes he prefers to ignore the situation. He's basically bedridden and completely dependent on others, had countless surgeries, plenty more to come and he acts like he's on vacation. We hired a caregiver cause there are days when he can't be bothered with changing bandages, keeping track of appointments and taking his meds. I took some vacation time but I can't be there 24/7, nor I want to become his caregiver. Should I encourage him to talk about his feelings or just wait for him to implode? I'll definitely talk him into changing the therapist, this one seems too easily manipulated. I joined him for few sessions, it was a total shitshow. She tried to make him talk about his feelings, he talked very optimistically about the future instead and that was good enough for her.

&amp;#x200B;

This might seem insignificant but it's what affects me personally the most. We've been doing the will they, won't they for few years now. Now we're spending so much time together and both of us are becoming way too handsy. I'm very much a hugger, he wasn't until recently. Even while he was in the hospital he would pull me in his bed and since I'm very compact, we spent a lot of time cuddling. I'm barely up to his shoulders and not looking up while talking to him feels unnatural. When he's in his wheelchair, I instinctively sit on the floor next to him and he starts stroking my head. We're spending a lot of time watching bad TV and there's always some sort of physical contact. We find ways to touch even when we're gaming. I know where this is leading. Don't get me wrong, I know him better than I know myself and I accepted him as he is years ago. I would be with him if he was just a head in a jar, but the timing is extremely wrong. I don't want to start something before he even starts coping with his own feelings. When he does, I don't know what the fallout will be and I would rather have him as a friend than not have him at all. I have no idea how to word that in a way that won't hurt him or push him away. I catch myself thinking we could wing it, come what may.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR- My friend lost a leg and is currently recovering at my place. His other leg was badly injured and he won't be able to put any weight on it a while longer, he's mostly bedridden and has a full time caregiver. I'm worried about his mental state. He's always been bottling things up until he implodes over nothing, now he acts like nothing is wrong. His therapist thinks he's coping incredibly well but takes what he says at face value. Frankly, she's terrible and I will talk him into seeing someone new. I joined them for few sessions and as a psychology minor, I could see how easily he manipulated a professional when he didn't want to talk about something. That aside, should I encourage him to talk about his feelings or ignore the situation like he does? Also, we've been beating about the bush for a very long time and now we're becoming incredibly touchy. He constantly engages physical contact and this already feels like a relationship, minus tongues and sex. I'm expecting him to make the move any day now. I want to be with him but I'm afraid of the fallout if we jump into that before he even starts acknowledging his situation. How do I even explain that to him without coming off like I don't want to be with him cause he's an emotionally stunted amputee? I know that's how he'll hear it.",27Aug2019,0

157,"When I was in junior high I was a **huge** and I mean **HUGE** bitch. I lashed out at classmates and friends, I called people names, got violent, got into easily avoidable arguments, among other things I deeply regret. This came as a shock to the people I went to elementary school with because back then I was ""super sweet and never swore or said anything bad about anyone"" (an actual quote from some of my classmates). I was awful to people that didn't deserve it, and I always cringe looking back. There was a reason I had changed so drastically, it's not an excuse for what I've done but I've realised now that it was the reason I had changed so much.

In grade 6 I had a ""friend"" Raylene, she was one of my best friends back then (I was friends with everyone in our small class but I was closer to her and one other girl, Haset, who we'll get back to later) now Raylene had a one-sided crush on a boy named James. Now Raylene thought that James had a crush on me, so in effort to gains sympathy and James's affections, she told James and all our mutual friends that I was bullying her. Of course no one belived her nonsense because they knew me and what she was saying was a load of shit, but no one told me that it was going on until the summer after grade 6.

This is where Haset comes in, she was hanging out at my place and she confessed to me about Raylene had said about me, after she left I contacted other people about Raylene and they confirmed Haset's story. I was crushed. I felt so betrayed and hurt and in my grief I had come to 2 conclusions.

1. That everyone around me was going to betray me at some point, so there is no point in trusting anyone. They're just going to stab me in the back like Raylene did. (I still have trouble with this one. It has ruined friendships to this day).
2. Even if I was nice to everyone and they still think I'm a bitch there's no point in being anything else.

I had this mind set for 3 fucking years. I am still struggling to brake this mind set but I have gotten better over time with the help of my best friend Olivia, I have learned to trust that not everyone is going to stab me in the back like Raylene did. If it wasn't for her, I would still be the insecure bitch I was back then and I'm so grateful to her for helping me overcome my insecurities and trust issues. I still struggle but it has gotten easier. I'm going into grade 11 next week and before then I'm going to apologise to the people I was so awful to, because they didn't deserve to be treated like that.

162,"So for the past few months, before summer had even started (just started school today) I have noticed myself doing things or not doing things that I don’t normally do. I don’t put myself in social situations anymore, unless forced to. I don’t feel any desire to do hobbies I enjoy (drawing, reading, painting, biking, swimming and other stuff). I feel really weird. It’s almost like I’m fine most of the day and then I just have this overwhelming sense of anxiety once I’m shoved in a theater filled with 300 other people. My heart was beating noticeably fast, I felt like I needed to throw up but I couldn’t open my throat. (I didn’t throw up, thankfully) and it’s just that terrible anxiety feeling biting at my insides. I don’t normally feel this way around big crowds, I just find my friends and I’m fine. Most of my classes don’t have any of my friends in them, I’m by myself for all of two classes (social groups have been formed, most don’t like me because of reasons I’m not going to dive into) but I really feel lonely in class. 

I notice myself zoning out and not doing anything to zone back in. I often ask people to repeat themselves multiple times, I’m usually dead silent or if I say anything I’m either with a group I’m extremely comfortable with or just telling them some offhand comment on something that annoys me. I feel quite emotionally unstable, during the three months prior to summer I had multiple breakdowns and my mother kept telling me that she’d schedule a therapy appointment and it took halfway through June to get into the office itself. My mom has drunken herself to collapsing on the kitchen floor, the house is an absolute wreck because of mom’s emotional ties to items of my deceased cousin, my sister gets all of the attention because of her special needs and I feel extremely alone and neglected. I’ve been lashing out at my boyfriend, friends and family. Even today, I just was at an ice cream shop with him and his cousin and I just felt aggravated. He kept winning at cards against humanity and that pissed me off. I’d say things in a sharp or mean tone and then regret it and I need to have someone say “I know you did this but i accept your apology, we are fine now.” And I’ve been directing my anger at him and I don’t mean to. I’m so emotionally distraught, I’m either angry and easily pissed off, void of feeling and just wanting to feel something or being so fragile at the slightest touch that I cry. My therapist says it might be depression (the mood swings) and I scheduled a psychologist appointment and mom said “psychologist evaluations are only for really mentally fucked up people.” It hurt and now I don’t want to tell her I’m feeling this way. My therapist advised to talk to my school counselor about a psychologist evaluation so the school doesn’t reject an outside sourced evaluation. But I don’t want to be treated like a baby if I do have anything.

I don’t know what is good and bad to do about my problems. I try telling discord friends and one calls me a hypochondriac for being worried about my mental health. Others just don’t say anything. I’m scared and I just hate being mean to others (especially my boyfriend) and I just want it to stop and have everything go back to normal. I want to feel actually happy and not this weird mixture of whatever the hell im feeling. (Btw I’m in America)",27Aug2019,1
163,"I suffer from many different mental health problems but my main issue is PTSD and depression, though I also have Asperger's and anxiety. My PTSD mostly started when I was 8 years old, my uncle hanged himself Infront of me and my cousin's who was also 8, at 10-11 years old I was abused by a 13 year old boy, he made me do some sexual things with me and made me do things like cut my wrists, hips and ankles and also send him nude images to him and he also sent images of him and older/much younger men, if I ever tried to resist he would punch, kick, push and do more gruesome forms of punishment to me, when I was almost 12 he finally decided he wanted me to have s*X with him and that's when it crossed the line with me, I ended up having to run from his house makes and asking a woman passing by for help and to call the police, I got a teen restraining order against him (which wasn't enough in my opinion but they couldn't really do much more seeing as we were so young) you may think it's stupid that I talked to him in the first place but he was my friend (or so I thought) for 2 years and I was in a very Vunerable time in my life where I was depressed and I loved the thought of someone wanting to see my body, I'm currently nearly 15 and my PTSD has gotten worse and I've gotten very suicidal but I'm currently getting therapy 2 times a week and am on medication and get check ups every 3 weeks by a doctor to see if I have any more cuts or if my body is getting weaker, if I'm eating enough ect. Also my doctor said the reason my PTSD is so severe is because there is a couple of things that have happened that could give most normal people PTSD anyway and my anxiety takes in everything as a bad thing so if even a little bit goes wrong in my life my anxiety could take it as a terrible thing and make me have panic attacks and make my PTSD triggered, I would love for some support in the comments and I know Reddit is a lovely place for people to listen and I'm supporting a of you no matter whats going on &lt;3

TLDR: I have autism, PTSD, anxiety and depression and my PTSD is pretty severe because I was abused and my uncle killed himself Infront of me so now I'm in therapy and on prescription meds. It also happened when I was 8-11 years old and now I'm 14.",27Aug2019,1
164,"For the past years of my life, as the soon to be ""inheritor"" of the family problems (ironically I'm not inheriting anything in the future as its for my spoilt sister) I always worry everyday in my sleep and my studies to gain recognition from my parents and that lasted for 4 years.

Now I got a first class and after that ceremony, I can't sleep. Not because I'm happy or anything but I can't sleep at all. Everyday, I'll sleep at 5am and wake up at 10am and I'm notice my health is deteriorating faster like my joints and my focus and even I notice emptiness inside me like there is nothing left for me to do.

168,"First a TW: I mention an eating disorder a lot throughout the story so please bare with me. 

So I guess I’ll start with a bit of background before I get into it. So I’ve got an eating disorder and have had one for a few years but in the last year, mostly 6-7 months it’s been extremely bad that I had lost 30lbs in about 2 months. And I also struggle with body dysmorphia, but I mean I think that just goes with have an ED. 

But so basically my(F19) best friend (F20) is really petite and skinny and I’m very tall and not skinny. So I had somewhat recently mentioned to my best friend (while drunk) about my ED. I only mentioned that I struggle with body image and count calories, so she doesn’t know at all the extent of my ED just that it’s there. At first of course she seemed worried and tried (I say lightly because all she did was mention it) to seek help/therapy. We didn’t talk about it very often, only when I was drunk because that’s the time when I guess I’m an open book. So overall she doesn’t know much about it but would seem somewhat concerned. 

So lately, I’d say the past month/ few weeks? She’s starting saying things to me that just I don’t know hit me wrong? Like I’d show her clothes I think are cute and she tell me how “you need a certain body type to wear those” or when I had mentioned how I had lost the 30lbs because it came up when she saw my weight, she kept telling me how it doesn’t look like I lost any weight or that I look exactly the same. The biggest thing that recently happened was when we were talking about this guy I’d recently started talking to and she told me how he probably wasn’t going to be interested in someone whose “big and intimidating” (like me) and how he’d probably “go for small and fragile girls like [her]”. that just almost broke me. Like I don’t know how she meant it but it seems like to me she meant this guy couldn’t like me because of my weight and would only be into girls like her. It just pisses me off because she knows how much my weight bothers me and how much I hate myself and she still says things like this! I don’t know what to do about it, it’s just gotten to the point that she triggers me almost every time I see her to the point where my ED either gets worse and I starve myself or I end up binge eating which leads to me starving myself again. I really need advice on how to handle this because I don’t want to talk to her about it and I can’t just stop being her friend but I also can’t keep doing this. 

TL:DR: my best friend knows I have an eating disorder and continues to make negative comments about my body that triggers me to worsen my disorder.",27Aug2019,1
169,"Going back into a dark place and think I need a serious conversation.

(17m) depressed, suffering from anxiety and suicidal. I started wanting to die at 11 being at boarding school leaning over the edge of a roof thinking I should just jump off and I wouldn't have to struggle anymore. I first tried to kill myself at 16 by slitting my leg open with a razor blade I even took a paracetamol as it's a blood thinner so there would be less of a failure but I didn't die no one found out as I did it in the bath and after an hour i drained the bath and went to bed (this was at school). The next week i got 2 of my friends got them drunk and told them this worked we even made a ritual out of it where every other week we would just talk about problems and get drunk and do drugs and we would talk about our issues even more people started joining it.

A while ago we stopped doing that I think it just dulled the mood. Only one of my friends keeps talking about mental health but he has a bit of a problem with all of it as in he can go to the extremes of drinking and drugs so I dont want a problem for him so I want to not rely on substances to allow me to talk about those things so I think talking to people who dont know me or any one who knows me is a good start.

I have exams coming up and I'm in a similar place a few months ago I got drunk and overdosed on pills and remember hallucinating thinking i was going to die i was terrified but somehow i was ok with dying thinking at least it wont look like suicide even though now that I'm sober i now it obviously would have.

172,"I constantly live in pain. The person who I loved more than anything, the only person I really had in my life left me. My depression and anxiety is just in a never ending loop. I do nothing but cry. I don't have any joy in my life anymore. I don't have friends or family. I live in a house where one person is a dick and the other is constantly attempting suicide and I'm the one having to pick up the pieces. 

When I say I don't want to be here I don't even know what I mean. I want to die but I don't want to commit suicide. I get suicidal thoughts all the time but just don't want to do it. 

I love my job and my colleagues. When I'm at work that's the only time I can escape what's going on. But I just don't find joy in having my dream job anymore. I still love it but it's becoming a chore to just get ready in the morning.  

I'm just desperate for the depression and anxiety to just go away. I know it won't happen but my doctor's refuse to help me no matter how much I ask for it. They just dump more medication on me although they never work, I tell them they don't help and they just don't care. No one cares. 

I'm probably going to lose my job soon because my mental health is just deteriorating so much. I'll probably lose my home too. 

I end up not being able to afford to eat because of all the bills I have to pay. I don't want to go to the food bank because there's people out there who need it more than I do. 

I constantly live with childhood trauma. I can't go a night without waking up having panic attacks and nightmares. 

I can't remember when I last got a good night's sleep or ate a proper meal.

173,So I’m coming to terms with the fact that I believe I grew up with a narcissistic father and an enabler mother. I’ve been trying to better myself and become mentally healthier since I was 15. Due to never really feeling good enough and being emotionally hurt so much I guess I have put up an emotional barrier. I know it’s not normal but I don’t really believe people are really sad or sorry if they don’t cry. Am I a psychopath or sociopath for feeling this way? If people say they are sorry I feel as if they aren’t sorry they hurt me but sorry that their image is tarnished. How do I stop feeling this way?,27Aug2019,1
174,"So, I have OCD. I don’t know if it’s because I’m obsessive or what, but is it normal to feel like cartoon characters or book characters (etc) are watching you? It’s only characters I really like. I sometimes feel like I’m being watched through my mind or someone is behind me, and they’re always characters from cartoons, movies, or YouTube videos that I like. Sometimes, I get anxious, like I can’t even say what they are, or they’ll “listen”. I also become really self conscious when I feel like I’m being watched. I hate getting details about the characters wrong when I talk about them because I might annoy them. It’s very subtle, but I can feel it. 
I remember one time, I was gonna get in the shower, but I literally had to stop because I felt like someone was there watching me through my own eyes. 
Or when I’m trying to sleep. Sometimes I get bored and start singing to myself. I have to stop, though, because I feel like these characters are judging me. 
I also get anxious and uncomfortable when I’m changing clothes/undressing in front of pictures with people on them. It’s like they can see me. I cover them up or turn them around sometimes. 
If I’m watching a YouTube video on my phone, I feel like I have to kind of tilt my phone in order to “let them see the video.”
I feel like they’re judging me. 
I wanna say it’s just OCD but I don’t get obsessive over it, or at least I don’t think I do. It just happens.

175,"Not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this in, if it isn't, apologies in advance.  

I'm sick and tired of being so awkward.  My co-workers don't like being around me, I constantly find myself struggling to form coherent sentences, and most of the time my co-workers have to ask me once or twice to repeat what I said.  When I try to make conversation with them, I always end up saying the dumbest things.  I swear I wasn't always like this.  In high school, I had a pretty sizable group of friends that I could talk with, all day.  I don't know what exactly happened to me, it's so irritating.

What comes out of my mouth: ""So what-arje the plans for today?""

I also struggle with anxiety.  For example, I don't feel comfortable walking around my workplace because it's an open office.  Actually, I don't feel comfortable walking around in public where I'm can be easily spotted.  I always feel nervous around strangers that can look and judge me at any time.

176,"I'm going to sound ridiculous. I know I am.

I know I'm wrong.

But I want to speak my true thoughts and maybe someone will hear me. Or get me.

I want to project these thoughts I've been having for years into words. Because they're not just thoughts but they put me into states of stress and anxiety.

I am 21 years old. Female.

 I know my habits aren't healthy. But maybe someone will get them.

I hate people. I know people say that but I mean it. I hate people. I hate my friends. I hate my customers. I hate my family. I was thinking about it and if someone could hand me a button to kill off everyone I knew besides 1 or 3 people, I would hit it instantly.

I feel like everyone is evil. Everyone has bad intentions and doesn't care for everyone but themselves.

I've never met someone as understanding and as kind as I am. And I wish everyone was more like me.

I never always hated everyone. Sure I thought everyone was selfish, but I still had a bunch of people I enjoyed being around and cared about that weren't my s/o or mother. 

I had a group of friends a couple years back who secretly hated me. I didn't know until they started dropping hints. The passive aggressiveness. The jokes with a little truth in them. I confronted them. And they made up a bogus excuse that was later admitted to be jealousy. Two people didn't like me so they got the rest to hate me.

Yeah. Now I really hate people.

I hate men. I've been sexually assaulted numerous times. Not raped. But molested. Attempt of rape. All that stuff.

I'm very social when I need to be. I can hold a conversation. I'm an extrovert. But it's so much energy. 

When I interact with my customers at work, I grit my teeth on the inside. I just want them all to leave. Just don't tell me about your day. Don't talk to me. I know you're probably an awful person.

But they love me. Because I'm good at fooling everyone into thinking I enjoy their company. Because I'm not rude. Same with my classmates, but I avoid them way more than customers.

The list goes on. I can talk forever about how my dad isn't in the picture, how my family forgot about me and my mom and all those details. But you guys get the point. 

One juicy detail about my life is that I think about suicide a lot.

I have been keeping logs and the past month hasn't been super rocky for me, but my longest depressive episode lasted from the end of April to July. I was able to mark everyday between that time with a suicidal thoughts or two. Or three. Lately I've been doing this thing where I've been noting places in my house to hang myself.

My mom is in such a stressful position where I just can't. Some days that's all I want but my mom needs me. She only has me and my brother.

I also have a dog. He's my baby. I bought him because I was really depressed and needed someone who needed me.

I have a brother, but he's overseas most of the year. My boyfriend has also helped. He helps me get out of bed and get some sun.

I'm not sure what I'm trying to ask at this point. Has anyone been through something like this?

I have days where I'm pretty normal but the abnormal days are torture, and they're pretty equally common.",27Aug2019,3

179,"I'm 30 and male. Yesterday was the first time I ever brought this up to a therapist. It's because I was too embarrassed and ashamed for two decades.
I dropped a massive bomb on my family a few weeks ago. A secret that has been eating at me like acid for 25 years. I  told my Mom and Dad I knew all about my mom's affairs. She had a lot of them. One real life affair (that I know of) and many, many on the internet. It makes me sick to think about. I was 5 when I first remember my mother chumming up to a guy from our church (""Rick"") who was 30 years older than she was. An early memory involves the three of us in a mall food court (he was a ""family friend"") feeding her french fries while she giggled. Even at that age, I knew that something was ""wrong.""  Rick was always around. She was always running off to his house. I heard sexually charged phone conversations. I heard oral sex at the back door when I was too young to understand what oral sex was (I figured it out later). I found a heart shaped framed photo of Rick with a Calvin Klein Obsession tag attached. I was forced to stay in certain rooms of the house for hours while Rick came over to be with my mom. I witnessed a lot, and it fucked with my head. 
My mom had NUMEROUS internet affairs, too, because I guess betraying us with some old fuck from our church wasn't enough. I saw SO many instant messages and emails that, again, were sexually charged. ""I love you."" ""I'm cumming."" I walked in on her having webcam sex one night. Do you know how fucked up it is for a little boy to see his mom wiggle her tits for strange men on the internet? The worst part is, she didn't care. She and my dad denied it ever happened when I brought it up as a child, probably to protect their goddamn precious conservative Christian family unit that they thought they deserved. 

Fast forward to now, and my dad pretended nothing happened. No, wait - I was gaslit. My memories were challenged. My dad explained that Rick was a standup guy and that my mother was always faithful. I was manipulated and lied to. My dad has to have the lowest self worth of anyone I know, to stick by a woman who fucked around behind his back for 15 years. Who does that? How can one person be that blatantly stupid and/or in denial? Who the fuck WOULDN'T file for divorce? Oh, wait - divorce would have made his Imaginary Invisible God very angry, so he pussied out and stood by his wife. I have no respect for him or his decisions.

Guess how I took being lied to? Guess how I handled the gaslighting and manipulation? Ding ding ding, you're right! NOT WELL AT ALL. I lashed out like I've never lashed out before and told my mom and dad some of the worst shit I could think of. Our perfect, ""normal"" family was totally broken and toxic (and then factor in my mom's OCD control and manipulation to really add a whole other level of fucked-up - I have two notebook pages filled with bizarre, off the wall ""rules"" we had to follow). Everything was all about my mom. No effort was EVER made to get treatment for her very severe OCD. So not only did I jump through ridiculous hoops to satisfy her OCD, I was controlled and deceived so she could hide her affairs and continue living her greedy, selfish ways.  And my parents played it off like EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL! Like none of this ever happened. What. The. FUCK?!

After a lot of denial from both Mom and Dad, I finally got my mom to confess to the affairs Friday night.  So finally I got some acknowledgement of what happened, but she refuses to go to therapy with me. LOL. Of course she does, because she's scared of actually improving herself and fixing a problem, because she and my dad long for the days of 1950s Mayberry where people don't talk about things and bury their heads in the sand.

Best part is, my dad's laying on the shame HARDCORE.  Waaahhh, now I have to go to therapy!  Waaaahhh, now Mom and I are fucked up!  Waaaaahhhh, Mom had to stay home from work you upset her so badly! 

I'm so full of rage and every negative emotion possible. My parents should have split because things were so, SO broken. We lived in a small town. And nobody in our town would have guessed how broken and toxic things were, because my parents were all about keeping up appearances, looking like a goody-goody church family, involved in the community, etc. Everything was ""fine"" on the outside. But it wasn't. At all.

I shouldn't have waited so long to come out with this. And I feel ashamed about it. I'm obviously angry with my mom for what she did. But I'm almost just as angry with my dad for ""holding it together"" and making us believe everything was ""normal."" It was so NOT normal. My mother did very, very unusual things and it's traumatized me. I am beginning the best relationship of my life and these things manifested (trust issues, feelings of ""when am I going to be betrayed"", etc.) and I feel like this problem is already dominating everything. It's dominating my life, actually. All I can focus on is this, to the point where I wonder if I should have just kept it all inside and let it destroy me until I die

I'm also having a crisis where I feel like my parents' marriage is a sham, my whole childhood was a lie, and whether or not my mom really loved me - or was I just a piece of shit to control and manipulate while she satisfied her greedy ways.

Any help, support or acknowledgement would be so appreciated.  Thank you.",27Aug2019,2

Because I think I can do a better job at handling the ugly parts of this life than a bunch of pills. And I'm only wrong about that sometimes.

I know how to be normal. I could will the illness away if I wanted to. When I don't sleep for days, it's a choice. You think it's easy keeping those eyelids open? When I get the feeling that the stranger over there might push me into traffic, I know to just keep walking. I pull it all together for work and do a damn good job. They call it insight. That's why I'm not schizophrenic, that's why they're calling it a personality disorder. It's who I am. The call is coming from inside the house.

That's why the pills will only numb me out. They'll take away just as much pleasure as they will pain, and they'll make me fat. I won't let them stop me.
