0,"So like..... I cant remember anything past yesterday (literally. I have no long term memory lol) but I think that I didn't get much attention as a kid? Im always trying to get attention from everyone by any means possible, this includes destructive behavior like self harm or violence towards animals and children. I never really feel any emotions I dont think? Not sure how emotions are supposed to feel but I don't ever feel stuff... Im always empty? Im always angry and depressed, thats really all I feel. I don't love anything and get annoyed easy (in turn causes aggression). I have no friends... seriously... None. I guess im looking for a diagnosis which I shouldn't be looking for on the internet but my mental health professionals are completely useless wastes of life. They are completely useless when I tell them how I feel, they say im bullshitting them or they just ignore what I said...",17Aug2019,1
1,When I was younger (maybe between 7-11) sometimes I would feel like voices were shouting in my head/ears and it would start quiet and get louder till it was very loud and uncomfortable then fade away again. Sometimes it was my own voice (usually if I was upset at myself) but often it was several voices I didn’t recognise. It stopped happening after awhile but every so often it happens again. I was reminded of this because I was trying to sleep and I suddenly heard what sounded like a small boy talking through a radio saying “isn’t that right guys” in one of my ears. Anyone else get stuff like that? I think it’s just my head playing sound clips I’ve heard before and I’m just not paying attention to my thought process leading up to recalling those sound clips.,17Aug2019,2
2,"I feel like my life is falling apart. I’ve suffered from depression for awhile but have been doing well on Zoloft and Wellbutrin. Back in May however, my wife told me she was no longer in love with me and thought we should separate. I convinced her to go to marriage counseling but it only lasted 2 sessions. We have been living with each other and our 3 child just going through the motions. I asked if she would see a counselor by herself as she has had a lot of loss the past few years and thought her feelings toward me maybe the effect of that. She has gone through a few sessions now but her feelings haven’t changed. I thought I could move on without her. 

Today at work however, my boss who is actually a good friend told me I wasn’t doing my job well. I felt attacked as this is the first I’m hearing this and I felt I was getting blamed for things that are his responsibility. 

I’m at a loss. I love thought about quitting my job and pulling out my 401k for the time being, I thought about killing myself, I’ve had suicidal thoughts in the past. I’m in therapy but I still feel like I have no one to talk to. I can’t speak with my wife, I don’t have many close friends, I don’t think my siblings would understand. I’ve spent the night convincing myself I need to be here for my kids, but I can’t help but think they are resilient and will be ok without me.",17Aug2019,2

5,"Today, I was just playing Roblox(Yes laugh at me I don't care) but that's beside the point. 
My five year old sister saw me playing and asked if we wanted to play together I say sure then minute goes by she wasn't playing on the same game and then she said ""I'm ugly"" and I asked ""Who said you were ugly?"" She replied ""I'm ugly in roblox."" I was like ""What?""

She repreated that 3 times and then she got mad and threw her stuff animals out of her bed and then she covered her bed with blanket (It was a bunk bed and she had the bottom one)

I didn't know what was wrong with her so I was in front of the bed but blocked with the blanket and I pretended it was a door and said ""Pizza Delivery!"" She opened it and yelled and threw more stuff animals I hate to admit that I kept continuing and that brought her to tears, so I told my mom about it and when we came back she started HITTING her tablets. My mom took it away from her and she got mad and started crying.

(Little bit of context) My mom was Mexican so you can pretty much tell,.... well how do I put it I guess she wasn't the literature type.

Mom: What is wrong with you
Sister: (studdering and tearing up) I'm I'm I'm I'm ugly
Mom: Who told you that?
Sister: I don't know
Mom: If you don't tell me I am gonna hit you with a sandal
My mom reached for the sandal and she started screaming it was from school and I knew it was bullshit because she was saying she was ugly in roblox. 
This goes on for 6 minutes and we left the room to her all by herself.

I don't know what the hell happened I explained everything to mom and we both agree not to go in the room.
I basically really don't know why she was acting like this and this is the first time can anyone help me with this?",17Aug2019,0
6,"I'm 17 and a male for context.

I have been a shy person for my entire life, whether around my family, friends, or complete strangers. I just always believed that if you don't have anything meaningful to say, you shouldn't say anything at all. I am a very tall guy, at around 6'7"", so from my early childhood I had always been taught to suppress my emotions, as an outburst would look twice as bad coming from me. So, I did. I never let anything out and bottled up my feelings. As I got older, I started feeling worse. I was lazier, more tired, and in overall worse mental and physical shape. 

When I was about 14, I told my parents about what I was feeling. They didn't act as supportive or caring as I thought they would, but they decided to send me to therapy. I went to sessions for about a year, but nothing changed. So I switched therapists, and again, nothing. By this time my parents started getting frustrated with me, so I changed faces. I pretended to feel better around them so they could truly feel better. so yet again, I had to suppress my emotions. I stopped going to therapy, and started spending a lot more time in my room alone. To be completely honest, part of me enjoys it. No one bothers me and I get to watch YouTube and play video games, which are usually the two things that cheer me up. 

I do have a small group of friends, but we don't talk very often. When we do talk, it's usually full of trash talk and banter, which can get a bit tiring. I only keep them around so that my parents don't think that I'm a complete loner and so I don't become a full-on hermit. They're there, but it doesn't feel like they're there for *me.* I can't really talk to them about personal stuff because they will just use it as ammo against me. 

To be honest, I just feel alone. I feel like no one on this entire goddamn planet has a single care for me. I feel like I'm drowning at the bottom of the ocean. Part of me is filled with anger. Anger at my peers, anger at my parents, anger at the world, anger at anything that comes into my field of view. I just want to scream and tear my room apart. Another part of me feels that I deserve this. I was the one who was quiet, I was the one who never let anyone in, and I was the one who pushed everyone away. This is my punishment and I just have to fucking deal with it. It feels like since no one cares, what I'm going through isn't that important. Sometimes I feel suicidal, maybe every few days or so. The suicidal urges are not strong, but they get a little bit stronger every time the thought pops in my head.

I don't know what to do anymore. I've tried talking to my parents, I've tried therapy, and nothing is working. I just need somebody to talk to who will listen.",17Aug2019,1
7,"Hi everyone. I have had a video game addiction almost my whole life.

I feel that whenever I'm not immersing myself in a video game, I feel hopeless; I don't want to do anything, even though i need to study. I want to change. I don't want to burden my girlfriend with worrying what our future is going to look like.  I want to seek help except I'm not sure how to.

I need to get help, but the thought of going through the process of getting help is almost as painful to me in mind as the idea of going without help. 

Why is it that i can go through an interview to get a visa and move to a new country for a year to study and in the process make lots of friends and meet and talk to lots of random crazy scary people, then when i return i cant pick up the phone to order a pizza? why is that more terrifying to me?

It’s been to the point where just thinking about things has making me throw up due to stress. Most days I can’t eat or sleep and when I do sleep it’s never for more than 3-4 hours. I just hate how poorly I handle things. Even though there’s been some major things going on this year causing me stress, I hate how the smallest insignificant thing can get me so stressed out to the point I actually get sick. The most frustrating thing about it for me is how I can successfully pretend to be okay so nobody knows. Like on the outside I seem fine and seem to being doing okay, but on the inside I’m a fucking mess. Medication hasn’t worked and I’ve basically resigned to the fact that I’m going to be like this forever. I guess my question is, besides just generalized anxiety, is there any reason why I’m this way? Whether it be a hereditary thing, some type of personality disorder or something I just want to know. I hate how much I care about everything, I just don’t know how to chill out and not worry about everything.

If any of you could spare 10 minutes on a survey that looks at intrusive thoughts, it'd be much appreciated. The study will be **CLOSING** soon, much appreciated.

Thanks Nick

\[ACADEMIC\] RESEARCH ON ATTITUDES TOWARDS INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS “REQUIRE ADULTS OVER 18YEARS OLD”

Intrusive thoughts are unexpected and often unpleasant thoughts. They are experienced as involuntary, and are sometimes intense, uncontrollable and distressing. Intrusive thoughts can encompass any content that is relevant to the person experiencing them, or the situation in which the person may find themselves (e.g., doubting whether you have locked your car door).

Intrusive thoughts are commonly experienced by the general population. They are also a feature of psychiatric conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), eating disorders and hypochondriasis. This study aims to examine people’s responses to disclosure of intrusive thoughts.

What will participation involve?

• This research involves participation in an approximately 10 to 15-minute online survey.

• You will be asked to respond to demographic questions, and be presented with a short scenario describing the hypothetical disclosure of intrusive thoughts from someone (e.g., a friend). The scenario may depict a mental health condition, such as those mentioned above. You will then be invited to complete a short set of questions about your perceptions of the hypothetical person who made the disclosure. You will also be asked about your mental health knowledge and mental health symptoms (including OCD, anxiety and depression), beliefs about yourself, and your willingness to share distressing thoughts and personal information with others.

What else do I need to know?

• In order to participate, you must be 18 years or above, and speak fluent English.

• Some questions about sensitive topics will be asked in this study. If you are uncomfortable with this, you may wish not to participate.

Follow the link for further details and to access the study:

19,"My older sister is taking a gap year from college due to her depression and anxiety taking over her life. She doesn't want to go back because she is afraid of becoming more depressed.

But at this point, I'm afraid that she'll never make up her mind. I don't want her to live life with just a high school education and struggle to pay bills etc. Right now, she is living in my parent's house, I am as well because I'm a senior in high school. I don't know how she can get over her fear of college. She is traumatized by college. I don't know if I need to wait for her to feel better, or if I need to push her to do something. I don't know how to help her heal from trauma. We've tried a couple of therapists and antidepressants. Nothing has really worked. Idk if we need to keep trying at that or not.

It ends in awful grades, crying my eyes out after school, a couple miserably failed self harm attempts, and seeking help from strangers on the internet, only improving thanks to some very good luck. 

I’m so anxious that I’m anxious about my anxiety and depression. I can feel myself slipping at the worst time possible, with the first day of school fast approaching.

28,"

I met Steven sophomore year of math class. I don't know how we have to start talking, but we would talk casually as friends. I'm not attracted to this guy. He also doesn't take the best care hygiene wise and is overweight.

. He dislikes most black people and stereotypes them as ghetto. He also said racist stuff against immigrants. Also anti LGBTQ. I don't hold these views.My senior year, he hinted about asking me to prom multiple time in our history class. I told him I'm not going (which was true), but he should ask this other nice girl. Decline because I was interested in a guy who had graduated and we had talked since I was 15 names, Tim. We have different views on a lot of things one time he said it's okay to beat your dog when they misbehavior.

I talked to him about some of my issues because I thought we were just friends. I always made it clear I would never date him but encouraged him to ask out other girls or try dating apps. He always acted like he was stubbornly in love with me like we were the perfect match. We graduated four years ago; I live i a different state.

I open up to my guy issues with him. It's only usually Tim because besides one other guy when I was 18, he's the only guy I've seen on and off. He was and still is terrible to me. Used me for sex, used me to cheat (I didn't know about the girlfriend ).

I cried to Steven a lot about it which his response is ”well of course when you go after douche bag pretty boys you get treated that way” he's also tried to say why won't I date a kind guy like him because he listens to all my problems and we joke. I've wanted to say we're not compatible, and I will never feel that type of way.

He’ll also say things to me about starting a family, and that will make me truly happy. I NEVER want to be a housewife I don't want kids besides maybe fostering kids I just had issues growing up as a kid and teen. I don't feel I could ever be a parent, even working on these issues. It hurts when he says that to me because sometimes think about having a kid but know I could never be fit and cry.

One day He was going at me again about how we are a perfect match, and we make each other so happy. I told him back no, that's not what I want. He kept asking why I said we're not compatible. He kept pushing why and the reason. I just flat out said I don't find him physically attractive. He again asked why I said ”I don't know what I find beautiful” I don't want to point out flaws to people.

He kept pushing for how and why I don't find him physically attractive. He started calling me a coward because I wouldn't answer his question. I just said weight and facial features like the nose. He left me on reading. He texted me two months later I told him to stop contacting me he asked why I said I didn’t want to talk to him anymore and I said I’m blocking him and stop contacting me

My life has been CHANGED by the Lexapro. I’m happy and hardly ever anxious and have had hardly any suicidal ideation.  I went for my one month follow up yesterday and was prescribed my Wellbutrin. (150 mg) My doctor warned me that a lot of people get MORE anxious and jittery for the first few weeks and that the medication lowers the seizure threshold. These side effects don’t sit well with me and I almost wonder if it’s worth it to start if the Lexapro alone has helped so much.

Also, this is a throwaway account

I've been venting to this wonderful girl (who I basically use as a diary, with her permission, even when she's asleep or not around) for the past, IDK, half hour to an hour, and I've noticed a significant trend. Every time I say absolutely anything which would make it seem like I have actual reason to complain, I try to undermine myself in my head. I used to cry myself to sleep every night for weeks on end, but in my head ""No, that didn't happen. That would mean you're valid and your emotions are real."" 

It's not even like I go through some big logic loop or something, it's literally as simple as thinking that absolutely anything that would make me more than a nuisance to my family can't possibly be true. Anything. I was molested, and I literally revise the story in my head when I'm crying to me, like four years old, having been the one who was at fault. That's disgusting, and I would never accuse absolutely anyone else of that, but somehow I can do it to myself. Why?

I also constantly feel like a phony. I'm trans, but I haven't gone through any of the surgeries or hormone treatments. If I feel the slightest amount of dysphoria, I'm like ""Stop lying you poser, you're just making real trans people look bad."" I'm romantically interested in men, but if I think a boy is really cute, I'll be like ""Stop pretending. You don't like him, you're just pretending to."" It even goes down to things I like, like unpopular music. ""Stop listening to this, you're just trying to get attention."" I think this despite literally never showing people 99% of the music I listen to.

And I've been writing my internal dialogue as if it's been speaking to a third party instead of itself. It really does feel like this, a lot of the time. It feels like I have a logical mind and some crazy bully who exists only to criticize me. I think to myself in the third person, and I have two or more sets of thoughts going at all times. I don't know what that is. It's not even necessarily always that I have a good train of thought and a bad train of thought. It's like one train of thought is always normal, but it gets upset sometimes. It's always logical and it's me. Then there are one or more other trains of thought that are also me, but they're dicks to the first train of thought. They refer to the first train of thought as a separate entity, but they're all me. The first train of thought is just more me than the others. And it's not like these are occurring at separate times, or I'm bouncing between them. It's like I've got multiple tapes playing, as opposed to pausing an MP3 and listening to part of another and then going back to the first

My depression spells lately have been intensifying, and it makes me feel stupid and I probably looking like a fool.

Right now I am interested in a guy who was interested in me until he saw my arms and I honestly don't know what he meant by them scaring him.

I have thin arms, like chicken arms, but also they are covered in scars. Although also my whole body is covered from scars because I didn't know how to cope when I was 17 after a major event.

I live with that now and when it gets brought up (my weight or my scars) it makes me feel soo ugly. So ugly, and it doesn't help that I am 27 now, divorced and I guess I am ""lonely""?

I have nothing but love for her but I know I am hurting her. I have been verbally abusive and my actions are not healthy for either of us. My actions have caused her to feel very low as well. I don’t know what is wrong with me. I crossed the line and I think I lost her for good. I feel like two different people and am worried my actions will now have lasting affects on our relationship. I am constantly battling to do the right thing in my head. I have voices that speak to me in my head telling me what to do and not to do and it’s overwhelming at times. She says that if I  really loved her I wouldn’t treat her this way and it makes sense but in this case it’s just not true. I have nothing but love for her, I care for her and I want the absolute best for her. She’s everything to me and I don’t want to lose her. 

How do I control myself? Is this something I can work on or do I need medical help? 
How do I convince her that I love her and what I say out of anger is not really me? 
How can I better myself for the both of us so that we may have a chance of having a long, strong relationship?

My mom (62f) is the one member of my family that I'm closest with, and I want her to live a long and fulfilling life. She's my greatest role model and best friend, and I would be crushed if she wasn't with me anymore.


She's always been the backbone of my family, immigrating to a new country and starting her own businesses to keep a roof over our heads. She does so much in the household, from cooking to managing the business.


A few months ago, my mom told me she was diagnosed with depression. Being a korean woman (where mental illness is still very taboo) she chose not to take her medications, but today she had what I would call an 'depression attack' when she felt pain (though she said it wasnt physical) and was EXTRA depressed. We went and got her medications for the first time and did groceries for a bit to pick out her favourite snacks (chocolates and ice cream).

55,"Tl;dr: Traumatic life and questioning my diagnosis and just don't know how to process everything.

Hi, I'm a 22 year old female amd I'm about to give the most exposed details of my issues, more than I ever have on Reddit begore, as I mostly share isolated events. I have a diagnosis of Bipolar Type 1 amd PTSD. A doctor told me something unsettling yesterday that brought here to this subreddit to see if anyone can give me clarity.

The physical abuse:
From a young age, I have experienced varipus forms of physical (not sexual) abuse from my father that I still love. To be specific, he would: slap my hands hard repeatedly after making me hold them out, hit the bottom of my foot repeatedly with the belt while I was on the ground and couldn't move, slap me in the face really hard, broke a hanger when hitting me on the head with it.

How it impactes my interactions at school:
I wasn't allowed to do sleepovers, go to hardly any birthday parties, going to any events really, couldn't could to a football game until I was 14. I was kind of weird to people.

How I coped:
When I was 12, I would cut and scratch my arms up. It would hurt myself with a rock by grinding it against my skin. I wrote my dad a 10 page paper explaining how I felt and how I do everything I'm suppose to, how I make all A's in school and I want to enjoy people. He forced me to take my jacket off one day after school because it was super hot outside. He saw my cut arm and smacked me in the head hard for it.

How I tried to comply:
Two summers in a row (when I was 13 and 14), I worked for him all day every day and couldn't make plans to see anyone. When I was 14 I work 16 hours a day, 7 days a week, for 2 months straight. It was all manual labor in the heat.

How I rebelled:
I realized I couldn't do anything and so I figured I would just sneak out and play video games. My dad came looking for me, had a hit run done on his truck. When we were back at the house, he took his shoe off and hit me in the face with it repeatedly. He also strangled me (not fully, I just struggles to breath). Someone forced me to the police station (they wouldn't let me call my mom) and my dad got arrested... He lost his business because of it and a few prpperties he owns.

Important timeline:
14 yrs old- dad arrested
15 yrs old- dad gets out, mom has us see him illegally, I get raped by someone at school anally, house burns down, tore my hip labrum before getting to go to state (parents wouldn't take me to physical therapy and it still hurts 7 years later).
16- someone I was in love with told me they don't want to be with after they found out the rape incident.
17- I break down at school every day.
18- lose my virginity after I'm told I don't really have anything to save anyway
18-20 abstinence
20- boyfriend that saif he wanted to marry me then changed his mind after discovering my sexual past even knowing about the rape, I try to commit suicide by taking 24 clonidines (I felt dirty and worthless), friends leave me after I keep cutting myself after a relapse of not doing it for 8 years, quite cutting, sex binge of over 20 people in 2 weeks.
21- doing a little better, made a good friend, practice being alone more, have breakdown where a friend showed up while I was drunk and I had a butcher knife and was going to harm myself, checked myself inpatient because I didn't want friends to become stressed or bothered, later start a relationship.
22- I'm overall doing better and I work at the psychiatric hospital that I was in. Still have randome a huge depressive episodes but I should be fine.

My behavior:
I have heavy mood swings. I will all of the sudden feel heavy amd like I need to die immediately. People have a huge impact in my mood. I tend to be irritable about a lot unless I'm having a decent day. I feel like I lose touch with reality and I'll get scared and feel like I'm looking a different world and I'll feel removed from myself. I get paranoid. I'll think I hear or see something. Things will look distorted. A trigger will make me feel like I'm experiencing something all over again. I can't remember most of my adolescence. Of someone's mood changes ornif they are late or whatever, I'll feel hostile even though I won't express it. I'm timid. I feel a mixture of entitlement and worthlessness simultaneously. No one relates to me fully if at all. I'm super sensitive and empathetic and want to take people's pain. I over think and feel the need to be genuine. I'm mostly responsive but do make impulsive purchases sometimes. My mood changes drastically and quickly. Someone will show me annoyance and I'll will isolate and be scared. I'm scared of losing people. I'm scared of not being okay. I don't want to hurt anyone though so I'll try to be alone.

Help I'm getting:
Therapy and currently taking Lithium and Latuda

My diagnosis:
- Bipolar Type 1 (severe)
- PTSD
- Anxiety

My speculation:
- Quiet BPD (not to take away from the other one's, just maybe add?)

A doctor yesterday mentioned it but danced around my questions and said it won't change my treatment. I want to know so that I know what I'm dealing with.

I'm not really sure how to deal with everything but writing this post alone is helping process a little.

I want to know what you guys think about BPD or what I should even do about my life and about me. Anything will help... There's just a lot for me to deal with.",17Aug2019,2
56,I have anxiety and depression and have been with a dissosiative episode all day and its almost 6am and didnt sleep and its so fucking hard living like this. What do you do when nobody around you understands and you are all alone?,17Aug2019,5
57,"My treating mental health team are adamant that I have a psychotic illness (some times OFF-HANDEDLY mentioning schizophrenia), and major depression. 

I have tried 8 anti depressants, all at their respective maximum dose, and they didn’t work at all. (Currently on 600mg moclobemide)

Although the antipsychotic (recently up’d from 400mg to 600mg amisulpride) I take has reduced symptoms, I have never had a full blown episode (like the ones that cause you to go to hospital), and my symptoms were just minor weird things that were happening, stuff that ranged from, people watching me from afar when I was in large open spaces, the radio reading my emotions and I had a running commentary in my head that narrated what I did as I was doing it. Other things did pop up, like random/sporadic voices/words in my head and a mild paranoia that my parents were going to kill me although it felt like it was definitely going to happen, I knew it was illogical. 

I’m just wondering if my treating mental health team are correct in their “diagnosis” (it’s been 3 years and still they haven’t 100% diagnosed anything), and I want to, I guess you could say “test” their assumptions (I say “assumptions” because my current psychiatrist said directly to me “there’s no consensus on a diagnosis”, even after 3 years...), by going on a med free trial. 

I know I’m essentially playing a sort of game of russian roulette, but I don’t really trust my mental health team since they haven’t really done anything worthy of note for my situation. 

I understand this field of work is tricky business, but having one person not having a “consensus” with another person from the same team on a severe mental disorder, one saying I definitely have it (schizophrenia) and the other saying “oh I’m not sure” even though the one saying that is a psychiatrist, it’s waning my cooperative nature extremely fast. It’s been 3 years... I see the case manager once a week and they still don’t want to tell me what’s up.",17Aug2019,2
58,"this might be a bit disjointed.

sometimes i feel like my perspective, thatis the way i perceive the world and reality around me shifts. like im looking at it from a different lens. for moments i feel ""grounded"" and more self-aware/self reflective. at other times(especially in the prescence of people, i feel air headed. dont know if that's the best description.

kind of like all my thoughts are taking place against a backdrop of nothingness, almost like it's white noise or static. am still able to somewhat function and recollect things but i feel like im just reaching into static, yet somehow managing to recollect things.  

and then there is this surreal perspective that i slip in. i feel like there are a few variations of the various surreal ""realities"" i slip in, but one of them is kind of when im sick. everything smells sharp or dull, almost pungent. maybe it's because of mucus somewhere in my glands or something. and with that, it kind of makes the smell of detergents like phenyl(used for cleaning floors and whatnot) just add more surrealness. it's hard to desribe, and i've never seen any media which has (i think) intentially induced any feeling like that in me. as i was typing this^ para out was feeling some of the surrealness i was describing. but rightnow, it kind of has slipped away and im feeling more ""grounded"" now. it's like a perspective shift.  

i also remember in my childhood being overwhelmed sometimes by this surrealness. for some reason, it would always get induced in my school. maybe it was the clinical lighting, smell of phenyl like detergents, bustling crowd of uniforms and my infeiority complex and was also always uncomfortable and uneasy. people i didnt know(and even people i did) felt foreign and alien to me. i feel like it was very predominant when i was in the 1st - 7th grade. always felt like i was functioning almost like a sub-human. id often notice sounds sounding muted and distant, especially when i was feeling isolated. dont really experience that now, and when they do sound muted its feels like the normal human function of tuning out background noise. back then it felt more,i dont know, ... other-worldly. id even often daydream about random shit, and kind of play out imaginary scifi(star wars inspired) battles for hours on end. and it deff wasnt how i watch sci-fi nowadays in my more ""grounded"" less-surreal days. it's hard to explain but it was bunch of surreal imagery. not that the characters i thought up were to other-worldly or imaginary(they were pretty similar to star wars charecters and vehicles) it's just that the entire ""vibe"" was ther worldly. 

this may sound like im just assigning blame. but i feel that maybe my parents may ave induced some of this stuff in me. they were(and are)  constantly bickering. my father used to have anger issues, and would often easily get upset, raise his voice or throw things around. i used to be(still am) a chronic procrastinator, and that used to frustrate him alot. he'd try to tell me/nag me ""nicely"", but when it had no effect, he'd just flip his shit and completely loose control of his temper. and after his episode was done, he'd just kind of fall into a sort of depression and apologize for not being able to teach me things that im supposed to learn. stuff like that. my mom would also sometimes act paranoid, and she(like me) spent/spends most of her time holed up in the house, kind of just napping. 

back in my ""surreal days"", i would often nap too. the etire experience honstley was just, for lack of better words, surreal. dont know what else to say. maybe my subconscous sense of isolation from most other ppl outside my family played a role in that idk. i still do kind of nap alot nowadays, but it just feels normal, not surreal like it used too back in the day. 

by the way this is just one aspect and mostly is refering to the past tho small remanants of it creep in to the present. want to talk about the present state of murkiness and conflict my mind is in, but i feel like the post is already too long. sorry if u couldnt follow along, i tried to put some of the stuff in words, but ifeel like i have such a vague grasp on it, that i cant convey it properly with words.

62,"To prevent this post from becoming excessively long, I'll refrain from delving too much into my past. But my childhood was quite bad and stressful and it's probably left a mark on me.

To the point.

Lately I feel like things have really begun to collapse around me. I concoct these superbly elaborate webs of lies, deceit and control everywhere I go and I've ended up incredibly alone in life.

Every romantic relationship I have, I have somehow fucked up by being incredibly calculated and controlling. I love being in possession of the girls I am with (and yes, I am aware of my use of ""possession"" here), I love their admiration, sex and support. However, every time I get into a relationship, I play the relationship like a game. I try to make them jealous, guilty and insecure to get what I want, which is ultimately more of them.

This shadow-side of myself would ultimately want a girl who is in total isolation from everything, with me as her sole caretaker. I have done this in previous relationships where I try to turn my partners onto those I deem to be a threat, and I can be very persuasive.

With every person I meet, there is a conscious metagame I play. I rarely ever feel like I am connecting with the person I am talking to. Every move is like a chess move, and whenever I am confronted, threatened or sense danger, I use every trick in the book to gaslight, ridicule or manipulate the target.

In every aspect of my life, I am a complete control freak, and the feeling of being weak and not being in control is a feeling I can only describe as pure doom.

I think I am capable of love. My longest relationship lasted for over three years and it was for the most part quite nice. I am also not intentionally abusive and the suffering of innocents is not something I enjoy, although I do take pleasure in destroying those who challenge me, but that might just be normal.

I've had three serious relationships with three girls who were really wonderful, but through my manipulative and controlling schemes, they (the relationships) are all in total ruin. I have destroyed my reputation in several social groups, leaving me damned and outcasted.

And I don't know how to stop. I really don't know what's wrong with me. I recently started anti-depressants because my life just does not get better.

I know the obvious advice here is ""seek professional help"" and that is something I'll consider down the line. As for now, I want some opinions or advice from the non-professionals, because life overall is starting to become very tiresome and my webs of control are snapping all around me, making everything a whole lot worse.",17Aug2019,3

The way I was raised, I am just an impulsive and disruptive failure. According to people close to me I'm lazy, stupid and cant focus. I personally dont feel like I am lazy, but all the things they point out when they say these things make me second guess. I dont personally think I am performing to the best of my potential in every aspect of my life, but I've tried everything I can think of to fix it and nothing works. I'm not 100% sure if this is the right place to post this, but since it is technically a mental health question/rant/whatever, I figured I'd give it a shot. Do you guys recommend going to see a doctor? Or do you think it could be something else?",17Aug2019,1
65,"I’m sorry if this is not the right place to post this, delete if not allowed. Also sorry this is kind of long.. My husband and I are on an extended vacation in another country to visit his family. We are here for a total of three months. Generally speaking, we have a good relationship and marriage. We don’t fight often, and when we do it’s usually over in a few mins and we talk it out. Shortly after we got here it seems my husband has no patience for me. I have anxiety and adhd, so sometimes I ask a lot of questions, especially since most of his family does not speak fluent English. It has left me feeling a little bit out of place and left out, even though his family is wonderful and welcoming, I wish I could participate in the conversations etc. I feel like I’m an annoyance to my husband since I’m constantly asking him to explain things to me and I’m pretty much always up his butt (for lack of a better phrase) because I cannot drive here, have to rely on him to translate etc. Anyway, the past couple of nights he has seemingly flipped out on me for no real reason. He has seemed stand-off-ish so I asked him what is wrong, and he says nothing but my anxiety won’t allow me to just take that answer and my mind starts wondering and thinking he’s irritated with me, sick of me, his family doesn’t like me etc. I only asked him twice last night and he lashed out on me in front of some of his family. It was really embarrassing. This happened again tonight when I asked him a couple of times how he was planning on getting internet for the place we are staying. He flipped out on me in front of his family again and told me not to ask questions and I should just trust him that he has it handled. He keeps telling me not to keep pushing him and asking him what’s wrong when he’s not in a good mood, but he doesn’t understand how it feels to have anxiety. Any input at all would be appreciated. Am I overreacting? How can I try and explain to him that just a little communication goes a long way and will put my mind at ease?",17Aug2019,2

Open pokemon go, nothing there, refresh reddit popular nothing new, open pokemon go nothing there cuz i caught it a minute ago refresh Reddit suddenly hours have passed on the couch doing nothing.

Im hungry but i need to wash a bowl and the sink is filled with dishes so I give up. I'm thirsty but no cups are clean so I sit back down. Repeat this cycle until my fiance comes home and I can ask him to wash a bowl and cup for me. I need a shower but im so tired that the effort to get into that shower is too much so I sit there in dirty clothes and old sweat for days at time until it gets more than I can stand and force myself to bathe.

I don't go outside for the most part without my fiance safety net. I don't work because I couldn't take the anxiety and stress and panic attacks anymore so I quit. I don't take public transport because I'm surrounded by strangers and im scared  and what if I miss my stop or someone sits next to me or im late and my mind is racing and im on high alert and and....

I try to start an online business because I've sold the stuff I make before so it makes sense to me. I can start it up but then I freeze up or end up stuck on a part or in endless researching and I back out only to repeat the cycle in a few months. 

I have no money in the bank and it kills me at the end of the month when i did jack shit to help out with the income because I'm too tired or too mentally frozen to function in any form. I have the skills but at the same time I'm wrapped up in whirling thoughts and worry and stress to the point where I feel suffocated. Wrapped up and locked down by invisible chains and weights.

4 therapists now and it's all the same, A few sessions here and there and they start focusing on the one thing I don't have a problem with event though I mention the problems and I drift away and stop going because an appointment needs to be rescheduled and even the thought of being on the phone puts me in almost paralyzing fear. I have meds. I take them as often as I can. Sometimes I forget, sometimes forgetting once knocks me off track for weeks at a time.

I can't work, i can't make appointments, i can't take public transport, and don't really have friends because im not super social, i can't really function at home... i don't feel like im alive, just a tiny human-shaped puddle of stress floating in an ocean trying to keep my head above water. I've humored the suggestion of applying for a disability, but i don't have nearly the medical document as i can't keep steady appointments due to the stress and anxiety. 

Idk what to do anymore. What should I do? How do I get financial help? Mental help? Being a functioning adult help? Help...",17Aug2019,5

71,"I've always been scared of diseases and injuries. I wanna eat the healthiest foods, have the healthiest lifestyle etc to increase my chances of staying healthy. Being way too obsessive over what I eat has resulted in orthorexia. I CONSTANTLY worry if what I eat is healthy or not, and I constantly plan and worry about what I should eat next. Obviously, it's not good for my mental health to always feel the need to be perfect all the time. Mental health is just as important for health as your physical health, I know that. I also know that the pressure from social media is making everything worse because just as I change my mindset to think that I can enjoy myself *sometimes,* someone on the internet goes ""NO ONE should EVER eat gluten or sugar!!! It's poison!!!"". Even though I know people who are over a 100 years old and healthy allow themselves to have dessert for birthdays etc., I still worry about it just because those people online mess with my head. Yet, I still follow these people. I just can't stop. 

If I notice some kind of small pain anywhere in my body, or just something abnormal I worry A LOT. It's not even funny. I've suffered from acne for 4 years now, and I KNOW that acne is mainly caused by something internal. That makes me worry as well. I don't know how to get out of my orthorexia because I've tried so many times. Same thing with being a hypochondriac. 

I feel sooo incredibly silly. I've been worried ALL SUMMER about various things and it has totally ruined my summer. Whenever one problem/health worry disappears, a new thing shows up. I'm underweight and probably have nutritional deficiencies due to my restrictive eating that has been ongoing for many years now... The skin on my body from head to toe is really dry and flaky. It just sucks.

72,"I hope this is ok to post here. I checked a few other subs first and the rules said no treatment advice, but I don't see that here.

I found some old papers from my psychiatrist, and I'm curious and confused about some of the stuff on it. Aside from his unreadable handwriting it seems some of it is incomplete, and I'm trying to make some of it out. 

There's a page that has separate lines for Axis I, Axis II, etc.

Axis I has a code for the main diagnosis (which is a misdiagnosis, but whatever).
Axis II is blank, Axis III has a word that I can't make out, but I'd swear it was Andrew if that would make any sense. I'm pretty sure it starts with an A and has an ""r"" in it. While I do likely have ASD, this psych doesn't agree, so I don't think it's ""Aspergers.""
Axis IV literally just says ""3""
Axis V says... 55, I think?


Can anyone make sense of any of this? Any guess what the A word might be? And does anyone who knows about diagnosis/the DSM have any clue what a simple ""3"" in Axis IV might mean, or a 55 in Axis V?

Thanks so much!",17Aug2019,1

He feels numb, useless, he's tired all the time and says he feels like he's out of his mind. He's been having such periods in his life 3-4 times since he was about 15. We think it might be because of continuous traumatic experiences from when he was a child.

75,"When I see, or hold dangerous object I have violent thoughts. When I hold some metal object and I am at job, I have thought and impulse to kick somebody in head with it. This is scary. Or when I see axe, I think what if I hit somebody with it. Or I was in my sister's apartment. Wooden hammer for meat was in kitchen. I had this thought/impulse, what if I kick somebody in head with it. Same day I was in car. Her husband was driving. It was night. The street was dark. Woman was on street. I was thinking what if I hit her with car. Or I had impulse to hit her with car, like it wasn't real, like it was video game. I felt some pleasure, some dopamine rush like when you prepare to shot somebody in video game. After that, I felt fear. I am afraid of my self.

&amp;#x200B;

I always hide dangerous objects. I don't think about them when I don't see them. There were metal bars on table. I was afraid that I will kick somebody with them. I took them to give them to man, who sells old iron. It is how he earns money. He wasn't at home. I put those bars in trash. After that those thoughts disappeared. Fear disappeared too. I had big knife in room. I had suicidal thoughts, I will write later, why I wanted to kill my self. I wanted to stab my self. But this knife was scary. I put it somewhere, where I can't see it. Fear disappeared.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not sure when it started. I had metal bar in room, it was part of something that I tried to repair. I was afraid that i will hit somebody with it. I hidden it in place where I can't see it. I think it was that that when it started. Or maybe it was this day: Neighbors called me to help them something. I was standing and they were sitting. They both were old. I had thought what if I beat them. I was afraid, I left their house.

&amp;#x200B;

I did some research. People with harm ocd aren't violent. But I was violent. In march 2018. My father told me that I stole his money. I tried to prove that I didn't steal his money, but he continued to humiliate me. I was sad and angry.  I went to my room. I was sad and angry 5 hours. Later I went to kitchen. Both of my parents were there. I told my mother what he said. Then I took his arms. I wanted to put him outside for 30 - 60 minutes to see how I feel. My mother didn't know what I want to do. She was thinking that I want t beat him. She tried to stop me. He fell on floor. I put my hands around his neck to scare him. I didn't pressed his neck. It lasted 1-2 seconds. Then he screamed: help, this thief will kill me! I got so angry and sad in same time that I spat on his face and I kicked him with fist in stomach. Then I went to other room. For some time, I couldn't remember that I was in this room, but then This memory was back. Then I went to kitchen again. I was trowing stuff everywhere, I tried to find where was his money.

Later I saw that his elbow were wounded.

Guilt, depression, self hate and suicidal thoughts were killing me for a long time, till May 2019, it is 15 months. i tried to kill my self week after it. An I was 2 times near suicide. Guilt sucks really. it stops you in everything. I missed some opportunities. I stopped playing guitar. I stopped learning foreign languages. I wanted to pul my hair from my head. I gained 20kg, because I wanted to be unable to find a girlfriend. I am fat now. I felt pain in chest, and there was blood in stool, when I am in toilet. I had suicidal thoughts every day, non stop.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I don't have suicidal thoughts frequently. I feel better, but still I don't do things that I like, because I would feel guilty, if I tried to improve my self. I played guitar and composed music because I wanted to be famous. Now, after I kicked my father and spat on him, I don't want to put my face on anything.

76,"Hey there,

I am struggling to on the right track and I need help. I am unable to find friends and some of my family members are ignoring me and pushing me away.

My parents are always fighting, and most of the time they do it near my room. When ever my parents fight, I keep getting bad headaches and the only way to take them away is if I go to sleep. I do put my earphones on, but it really doesn't help.

My brother and his girlfriend (who I call as my sister*) moved in a little room in our yard. At first they were friendly and caring and my sister motivated me to start losing weight. However, recently they have gotten very quite. They do talk to me, but it is normally ""Hey Ed, how are you?... I'm good. I'll See you later"". They always called me to play Xbox before.

As I mentioned before, I have no friends nearby. I can't seem to find any friends. Since grade 4, I have been bullied by kids calling me names and saying bad things about my weight. In grade 7, people started calling me, ""fat apple"", I battled to ignore. I told my parents, but even getting the kids in detention didn't stop them. At the end of grade 7, I made a choice to do homeschooling. And doing homeschooling was the worst choice I ever made... It made me more depressed..

When my dad passed away, my other 5 siblings from my dad's side wanted to put me in an orphanage. They said that no one can look after me. I was 14 when they said this. Since they said that, they have been quiet. 3 of my sisters blocked me on WhatsApp and FB.

77,Hi! So this is a rant about how LONG you have to wait in my country to get into therapy. In januari I asked my doctor for help. I was not doing good and had suicidal thoughts. My anxiety has came back too. He contacted some therapists but it took twelve weeks until my first intake. When having the intake the woman knew about my suicidal thoughts. She said I needed help as quick as possible since at the time i was 18 and lived alone. I don't have parents who help me only my boyfriend who works a lot at night (when the thoughts get worser). I haven't heard from them since then. They promise me to call back every time but they don't. I asked my doctor for other therapists but since it's so busy i have to wait yet another long time. Two weeks ago I had the thoughts again so I despirately called the suicide prevention line but they did not answer either. Do they only help people when it is too late? Because I get that feeling.,17Aug2019,3
78,"Hello, 

I have 34 yo, never been to the psychologist or psychiatrist, but I think I need help. First, on understanding clearly what my symptoms are, if that makes sense.

People see me as an exceptionally intelligent person, except that I'm not. I'm just excessive and obsessive and it gets things done but it's starting to get unbearable. If I like a dish, I would eat it for two weeks straight. I stay away from videogames and smoking because I'll do it 24/7. If a task is appointed to me at work, I'll become obsessed about it and be an annoying perfectionist about everything. I don't stand other people's mistakes (even grammar or spelling - take notice, English is not my first language). 

I won't take care of my person, I eat too much because of anxiety, I won't shave or *go to the doctor and follow treatments*, even if I have massive allergy problems.

On top of all that, I have a very easy going passive personality, so I'm the only one suffering with this.

after I have been diagnosed with Bipolar II, I‘ve been doing research on mental illnesses and I came across Antisocial Personality Disorder and found some things I saw myself doing:
Like using people for my benefit and disregarding their feelings (but still feeling bad afterwards). It really came to me after I talked with some peers about working in a care home for old people with dementia and I, the stupid idiot that I am, said that I wouldn’t mind working there because after some point, I’d just see them as meatbags I had to care for. I realized, how much I don’t care for others or see them as humans, as long as I am profiting. But I‘m not sure if I am deliberately manipulating people, it sometimes just happens.

She asked me if I had read anything online about it and I said a little, sounded like schizophrenia but I'm not sure.

She said ""we don't use that name anymore, we call it psychosis,,,"" and I was a little shocked because, what? Please tell me if I'm wrong but isn't psychosis when you're gone from reality? My grandmother had it recently and she was so unaware and just completely lost(she's ok now) but I've still got my grip on reality. It also makes no sense to throw away the schizophrenia diagnoses.

And after taking it for a week I decided to stop taking it and I convinced my parents and my doctors to see if I’m good without it and if I’m not they will forcefully make me take it only if I hear voices telling me to harm others or myself (their main concern)
I wanted to stop taking the anti-psychotics only so I can take acid more frequently 
Since antipsychotics affect serotonin and dopamine receptors and blocks them 
And acid affects then and pre much they cancel each other out

Can confirm tho that when u take acid on antipsychotics you can still feel effects 

I’m not rly sure if stopping a mee that only is trying to benifit me was such a good idea just for fucking acid 
But at the same time I do like both sides of an acid trip bc I don’t see a bad trip as such a bad thing, near of all my acid come downs I’ve always had reflections on everything around me
But I can say when I’m sober for the past month or so I’ve always felt just fucked up and dislocated in a sense 

I’ve only done acid 3 times in the span of 2 months I think

Is this self destructing behaviour
Because lately I’ve been trying to teach myself ways to overcome irrational thoughts nc I’ve been running away a lot and shit without thinking it all through and I end up always either getting so drunk or fucked off acid 

Not a fan of weed bc I feel rly fake and unreal on bud
But acid it’s a completely different story

Just need advice or your thoughts about taking acid at such a young age with psychosis and shit 

And also would it have counteracted with my anti-psychotics and caused it to fuck up shit in my brain

94,"This is going to be a mess because I don’t know where to start. I’ll start here. What’s the point in living if I am miserable as soon as I wake up every single day?

I have no purpose in life and little to no hope that I’ll ever find purpose in anything. I have extreme social anxiety that holds me back from everything for the most part. I believe the reason for my social anxiety is simply the fact that I’m not as intelligent as everyone around me. I have a hard time holding up my end of the conversation because my mind is totally blank. I have a really hard time with articulating. I’m unable to make eye contact with anyone I speak with because once I do make eye contact I get nervous and stumble over my words more than before. My older brother is diagnosed with autism and I sometimes wonder if maybe I am in the same boat given that I act similar to him in social situations. 

I’m almost positive I have the inattentive type of ADHD since I find it extremely difficult to focus on anything really. I spend around 70% of my day zoned out. It’s almost as if my brain is cloudy which makes school and work extremely hard. 

It’s come to my attention that I am depressed and have been depressed for a very long time (even in my childhood). I have no energy to do anything at all, not even something as simple as brushing my teeth at times. When I get a job, I lose it because getting out of bed is too much for me to handle so I end up calling in multiple times, shortly after that I get embarrassed and quit. I have told close family members how I feel and I am never taken seriously. I’m always told by my dad to “just get up and keep going” which I am sure would help but I can’t find the motivation to do so. Therapy is not an option for my due to lack of finances.

Reframing your thoughts is one of the best tools I’ve been given to combat my negative thoughts and feelings towards myself.  What you do is take a statement or idea you constantly bombard yourself with and first try to find the falsehood in the statement, what within it is blatantly untrue or just a biased opinion. Mark what emotions are associated with this thought. Try to root out what you’re upset about in the statement, is there an underlying issue that this statement tries to hide in generalizations. Once you evaluate these things, try to rewrite this phrase in a way that holds the truth and then combat that truth. Once you can find the root reason you can start to address it, by either framing the thought into a positive or by giving a list of actions you can take to help solve it. 

I will use my journaling today as an example. This morning I woke up just down and even after meditating I still found myself to be anxious and irritated. I wrote down in a large, rambling list everything that scared me and any consistent thoughts that cross my mind. For example,

“I am scared to open up to others about my feelings and fears, to be vulnerable with others because I do not want to be rejected or ridiculed” 

This thought enters my mind daily. However, I know for a fact that opening up to others usually results in support and empathy. So to address this thought I crossed it out and wrote underneath,

“ being open will only help you. If you open up and people offer help you will get more support, feel less isolated, and deepen your relationship. On the off chance that person does ridicule or reject you, don’t sweat it. They have shown their true colors now and you are aware they are not a good friend, you can remove them from your life and find your peace.” 

I know this is not a perfect example of thought reframing but I just thought I’d share in case anyone could benefit from this.  I find this practice to be freeing and it helps me to ground myself and my expectations of others.",17Aug2019,1

100,"Hi everyone,

My name is Avery Powers, and I just turned 16. I had a close friend who has struggled with various mental health conditions, and I’ve seen firsthand how the stigma associated with them can make life a lot worse and significantly reduce the chance of reaching out for help. Luckily, my friend is getting better, but I know a lot of people are afraid or unable to get the help they need in order to get better.

Since this issue is so close to me, I have decided to do something to try and fix it. I am an avid songwriter, so I came up with a project called Songs to Bust Stigma. Here is my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpUpN-IeiLonbNXiiry7IPw) and my [website](https://www.songstobuststigma.site), both of which I am continuing to update. I am releasing some songs I have written that relate to various aspects of mental health in order to raise awareness of mental health stigma and hopefully reach some of the people that need to know that they are not alone. This is a message I would really like to spread, so please check it out and share if you can, and subscribe - I have 2 songs right now, but I do have a few more songs coming in the next few months.

Thank you so much for reading.",17Aug2019,6

103,"I (late 20s f) live together with my partner (early 30s m) and we have a good relationship, mutual respect, commitment and love. I've had a traumatic childhood so I have PTSD and dissociative disorder but I live quite a normal life when there's not too much stress.

For a while now my partner has been struggling with really bad burnout due to issues at his work. He has obviously been stressed, tired and easily irritated. I've been there for him the best I can and have tried to spare him from any extra hardship. I know I can't protect him but as a kid my mom was mentally ill so I guess the idea of putting my unwell loved one's well-being before mine is built in very deep.

So now that I've had a few very rough weeks, faced a few big disappointments and dealt with some really stressful things, I have been and currently am in a serious need of support. I do go to trauma therapy once a week but I also need to recharge. And the best way for me to recharge is by being able to talk to him, being able to cry without hiding it, having him hold me so I feel safe. Just have him comfort me this time, be there for me this time.

It feels even worse that as he was told by his doctor to do the things he enjoys more now that he's on sick leave, he has a good reason to get lost into his online games and I'm left alone to take care of the household, pets and myself. I feel bad that he doesn't value our time together as much, I would gladly just binge on TV or lay in the bed with him. (Of course we do those things too, but less.)

I feel useless because I can't help him. I'm scared of upsetting him. I don't want to burden him anymore. But I also really need some support, I'm really worn out and tired. I don't know what to do. I feel lost and scared.

I just wanted to write about this and maybe hear from people in similar situations or something. I know this is a difficult situation and there are no rights or wrongs but I'm just so stressed and need to get this mess out of my head and I can do that by writing.",17Aug2019,3
104,"when I was a teenager I was somewhat of a socialite and it peaked at my 2nd year of university (age 20) before falling off drastically after I came out of the closet 

9 years later I've just turned 29 and found myself in a very good social position fairly suddenly

I have a lot of friends and acquaintances, I'm very lucky, and I've garnered some respect from the community and my circle is still expanding faster than I can keep up

so this is a good thing right? right, in a lot of ways

the bad things:

1. I feel like I'm making big mistakes left and right and being an asshole and possibly coming off as a creep without realizing it (though nobody has really implied as much)
2. the pressure is building since I know my suddenly raised profile means people are watching and that makes me nervous because I can be very problematic and make big mistakes sometimes
3. my stupidly big heart is causing a lot of problems as I give people too many chances and make big leaps for people I barely know (this is hard to stop because I've always been this way)

I'm honestly not sure how to handle this situation

I'm usually a confident and generally put together person

anxiety and worry is not something I've known for

neither is caring what other people think of me

but this rising profile + close association with some big name power players = intense self-criticism and weird feelings

I've also recently converted to Christianity and though I'm not some sort of fundamentalist asshole it definitely puts me somewhat at odds with my circle and the missteps related to that are also something I'm fixating on a lot

I can't slow down, my entire personality is one of expansionism

105,"I watched this show with an episode where a family sits down to eat and they fight and get angry and throw things around. Then they kiss and make up, even if resentments were still heated.

Anytime i started conflict with my brothers i would get hurt by my dad very badly. And that was the lesson. Yell, and your body will pay. 

So now, i am almost friendless. i have shut out any friend who is hurting me or someone else. Same for men. 

I want so badly to have that family that screams at each other and only consequense was to hug and move on.

108,"
First a bit of background info for those wishing to skip ahead questions are in there own section down below: recently a family member pulled me aside and gave me this speech how i flip back and forth on jobs. Told me that i need to go back to therapy but i feel just the opposite. That i am just struggling to find my footing in this world after years of bipolar trashing my life. At 24 i was diagnosed with bipolar 1 but my therapist thinks i may have been sliding into it since my late teens.

currently i am in college full time with around two years left to go on my bachelors degree. My grades are good but i have quit 4 jobs in the last year all within a week or two of starting them. i have noticed that i get bored with the job or start hating the job pretty fast. Its not that i don't want to work but i also seem to take bad jobs. Like one job i left because it was a night job (11pm to 6am) working on fixing the store after closing hours the boss told everyone on the team the shift had been changed to morning( 4am to 9am) except myself and two others. I only found out when i showed up for work and an evening employee was closing up. i went there for another two days before quitting because of all the miss management.

Questions/problem: Is it common for people with bipolar disorder to have patterns to take jobs then quit them one after the other? Since doing three years of therapy my only long term job was 7 months before i quit without notice for a better opportunity that turned out to be lies.

My current job i have had less then a week the boss has told me to slow down because i am trying to do to much at once? Could this be another sign i need more help. I am not purposely trying to overload myself but its like when i start work i just take off and work my butt off without slowing down. Sometimes i will even work through break or lunch because i am too focused on the task at hand.

Other then going through phases of hyper sexuality and spending issues with the occasional mood swing flair up here and there my meds seem to be working. I am on lamictal and have been for around 4 years. I finally feel better but after the argument with my family its got me wondering am i really doing better or am i slowly falling back into being unstable.

i would just like to know if any one else with bipolar has these issues and how they overcame them or if people on here think i should begin the process to return to therapist?",17Aug2019,1

So I've always been an anxious person. But I did a lot of work on all of this over the years and now I'm pretty good at keeping it under control. However, I've been working on a lot of different projects recently and I've been having things happening I do not know how to identify : 

Sometimes, my vision will blackout like someone just turned off and on the light very quickly. I think it's just me blinking but it's like my brain isn't aware that I blinked? 

I woke up one night and it felt like my hands were not my hands, and I could touch my chest but it felt like someone else was. Only happened once.

I can't listen to music when I go places anymore because it takes me out of reality or something like that and I have a harder time focusing on whats happening when I take my headphones off.

I've also been neither happy nor sad, but feel like I'm never doing enough for anything in my life (family, friends, work, passion, money, health)

I'm now 21, have a car and am in college as a Senior. During the first couple of years of my adulthood, I struggled with disassociation. Imagine like fifty TV channels all on at once in your mind at all times, that's what it felt like. I have been on a new medication since February for pretty bad depression and anxiety. My doctor is having me see a psychiatrist  (I see a truama therapist 1x a week right now) since I have been ideational constantly for the last month (with no will to actually act on, just intrusive thoughts). The biggest thing in the last month or so has been hardcore dissociation, but this time it's more like a complete fog and feeling like I'm removed from my own body. After a stressful day at work a couple of days ago, I literally had to clock out and stare at a blank wall for 60 minutes because that's all I could do.

125,"**So, long post ahead. I'll try to make it as easy to read as I can, but I'm not promising anything, especially since English isn't my first language.** 

**Thank you for your understanding.**

I am from Holland, and this account is a throwaway.

I've had periods of usually 3-5 years where things stayed the same, only to change my personality entirely in the next, so I'll catagorize this post as such.

My years before kindergarten were actually pretty fair for me. I did not experience too severe distress, and got along fine with everyone. 

I learnt how to talk extremely early, but I was slightly late on the motoric part (I have a verbal iQ of 142, a performal iQ of 94).

From 3 years old I started singing, which I still do. I have a burning passion for black metal, the darkest of music, and I am a vocalist for the genre. I'm not gonna link the band though, not everyone needs to know this, lmao.

The next is told from stuff my dad told me since I don't remember much. 

When I first entered school I panicked. I was the most extrovert and spontanious kid, and I still am, but at that moment I couldn't even move. I froze. 

As soon as I started school, which I did early I became an entirely different person. 

My hobbies were getting other people to do anything for me, and killing bugs in the yard, what a cliché, am I right?

It wasn't possible having a normal conversation with me, the other kids were slaves, and I was there master. If I couldn't make this happen, I'd find new friends. I didn't know a single moment of genuine kindness, which is funny, 'cause I had an enourmous sense of morale (apart from the bugs lol), and I desperately wanted people to like me. I still feel I chose to behave like this, since it's easy, but I don't really know. 

I saw my first therapist at age 5, and I have seen 10 so far (including psychiatrists), of which one diagnosed me pretty poorly, but more on that later. 

I never went through any trouble to nail everything at school, and read Italian literature (translated obvs) at the age of 6.

At age 5 I was done with all the hardest work in the entire primary school (so that is until 6th grade for all you american bois)

In 3-4th grade feelings were getting tense in class, and positions of power were being distributed, so I chose strategically to be the class-clown, which worked out quite well. 

5th and 6th I spent in another school, designed for those highly gifted in school shit, where I, instead of cowardly doing the safest, was a bit of a troublemaker. I never did anything that cost me trouble in the slightest as I always had, but this time I felt more trapped. So I fought a couple of times when some older kid tried to bully me. I'm mostly agressive with words. I don't call people names, I don't really fight, but I have the power to humiliate people to the bone whenever the fuck I please. I have never in my life lost an argument.

So that's what I did, and the older dude left the school because of it. Trust me though, he was a dick, he diserved it, people still praise me for it. At the end of 5th grade I started developing suicidal thoughts, for which I saw multiple therapists, that I manipulated with ease into not being able to convince me otherwise than wanting to die.

Anyway, that's when I joined the mayhem that is middle school/highschool...? idk man. 

Total panic struck, and there was always some kind of war going on in there, which drove me so crazy, that I lost myself in there. The depression got worse, but that wasn't all

Ya boy got a kidney disease and had to go through chemo. With me not wanting to tell the severity of my disease, people in my class thought I was going to wellness when I was laying with a bunch of tubes in me, which I hated, I wanted everyone to feel sorry for me, but I also didn't want to tell people about my suffering. Meanwhile I had a short relationship where I lost my virginity at age 13, but afterwards i was to ashamed, and I didn't really talk to her anymore. That too ate me up inside. For some reason, every time feelings get hurt, people seem to manage, and with me, it feels like everything had been building up my entire life. 

That's when I decided I should kill myself. Which I didn't, 'cause I couldn't even scream or cry, I just felt this hollowness that has been there my entire life. 

More depressive than ever I had to do the 8th again, and with me already being extremely mature for my age, I fucking hated it. I couldn't handle it at all. 

I had fluctuations in my personality. Sometimes I'd only enjoy other people's pain, as disgusting as possible if it could be like that, even to a sexual point. On the outside I was very charming, but also manipulative as hell.

Sometimes I'd be silent, hollow, and the most unlikely person possible (notice the contrast?). I'd often have extreme episodes of paranoia where I couldn't breathe. Those never went away.

That's when the psychologist decided I had ""A mild form of autism.""

She got fired so I got another one, who said I probably had some kind of personality disorder, but that I showed symptomes of 8 of the 10 possible ones. 

Then another came, said I had ADHD, another one said I was Bipolar, and all I could do was hate my fucked up self.

Right now we're 18 months after that. Due to my kidney disease and the health problems that came along with it I came on some sort of special ed, where I had 7 months that were even worse than anything, 'cause I was self conscience this time, and I could feel how fucking panicked I was every second of the day. 

Then I met my girlfriend. She was there for being abused, which lead her into a depression. I have since had a lot more control over who I am and what I stand for, 'cause thanks to her I know what I'm doing when it feels like I don't. The paranoia didn't get any better though, but relationships are relationships. 

From being what some would call a psychopath, to who I am now, is amazing, and I owe her my life.

I am no longer a loner, have an active social life, in which I have always been honest about everything, (all of my good friends know this story), and I have helped so many others in that class like my girlfriend helped me out (and the other way around), to love themself, and to find a reason to live, and I feel more like myself than ever.

So the answer to the question ""Am I a bad person"", is there, but I'm not resting easy just yet. 

The question now is: ""Does anyone even remotely understand what I'm talking about here?""

'Cause I'm tired of it being just a random bunch of symptoms to my therapist.

129,"I decided to go back to school after my previous job didn't work out. I've been on my own for almost 9 years prior to school... I came back to my small family home while looking for a job... Problem is my mother has been bedridden and dependent on drugs since I was born, and my brother is an alcoholic whom is 30 and lost his job and blames literally everyone else INCLUDING me, despite my literally just coming here 3 months ago.  


Needless to say, the family situation is incredibly toxic, dysfunctional, and co-dependent here. I need to get out. Problem is... Dealing with all the family issues here (despite it being only two people) is making it so hard for me to have ANY energy to even work towards getting a job. Being outside of the home is solace, but the moment I even think of coming home to even sleep I start freaking out. Since I'm still looking for a job, I can't just rent out a place down the street or a hotel to get out... But I can't sleep at all without someone knocking on my door to bother me about the most inane and childish things... Doing anything good for myself seems like it triggers them to start bothering me with their problems as if their problems are mine. If I don't, they attack with ""no one appreciates me and no one cares about me"".  


How do I build up my skin so that the silly things that they say don't get to me? How do I stop incessantly thinking about all of the issues that they're creating for themselves, me, and the rest of the family through alcoholism and dependency?  
I was never this stressed before, even while living with 16 different guys at University, I could handle literally everything. Here...

People don't kill themselves because they feel alone. People kill themselves because they ARE alone.

Problems are in our BEING. It doesn't matter how feel so much as what we ARE, what is ACTUALLY going on. If I tell you I'm ugly, exploring 'feeling ugly' is pointless. I am ugly. It is a part of my being. Therefore I need to become beautiful (Diet, exercise, plastic surgery). If I am alone, I need to become not-alone.

I’ve struggled with my mental health before about 5 years ago, but I haven’t struggled in two years if not longer. About a week ago I was completely fine, but about 4 days ago it just dropped. Something happened that made me feel a little insecure and worthless right before, but I’m over it all. So I don’t know if that triggered it or what, but I’ve just felt uninterested in everything and if I’m not out of my house doing something, I get extremely sad.

I’ve had a part time job for over a year, but yesterday was my last day. I usually worked 4-6 days week and I think it was a good distraction. I’m going into my senior year of high school and to avoid stress I’m not going to have a job. I’m truly scared that was a bad decision because now I have nothing to do tomorrow and I’m dreading it because I just know my mind won’t be in a good place. Now I have absolutely nothing to do everyday for the next week, and on weekends for the next year. Getting a job to distract me is out of the option due to the hassle of finding a job that lets me work one day a week.

134,"Trigger warning: suicide mention, and cutting 

My entire life has been a giant mess. I never had friends as a kid and now. I didn’t know how to talk to people and when I finally figured it out and I broke my isolation someone abused me sending my to a depression that caused me to cut and not trust people again. I have my amazing boyfriend who  has been with me while I was in the deep spot but instead of spending high school with him I went to a school for kids with mental issues. That school taught enabling behavior and I had classmates be creepy to me and follow me around and say inappropriate things but the school said that I should just ignore it because they are learning just like I am learning. This school had no honors or ap opportunities. The one teacher that I thought cared about me told me I would never be an author and wrote expletives and cruel things on my papers. When I returned to the school with my boyfriend I was bullied and gained 50 pounds and went into another depression which caused me to put off college for a year. I decided I was going to go to art school because no matter what art was always there for me. I even got a 4/5 on the ap art exam. This year I worked as a cashier at food service where my boss regularly belittled me, customers yelled at me on a daily basis, and I was sexually harassed both my customers and a co worker. I regularly had mental break downs after work and cried in the freezer. But I got into pratt, Sva, and waitlisted but ultimately denied from FIT. Unfortunately my partners didn’t communicate with me how much we could afford and I now have to attend a state school that I didn’t even get into their art program. I am at the same school as my boyfriend but at a satellite  campus. He is leaving Monday and I’ll be alone again. My entire life has just been shit with small pieces to live for.

It all happened because my siblings came yesterday to my apartment (my brother lives with me but hasn’t for a while because of his health, my sister lives at home with my niece and parents) and as soon as they got here, my sister was already using me as her emotional punchbag. She was pissed, God knows why, and well... I’m the one who always gets the worst part of it. My brother was mostly silent until he saw I haven’t been doing things as he does them, so they’re “wrong”. Everything in the apartment was wrong, and he started to badmouth me with my sister, as if I wasn’t in the next room and couldn’t hear them. 

Then, they started making plans for today and when I asked them where they wanted to go, my sister just said “somewhere”. Not an invitation, they didn’t even asked me if I had something to do today. 

So I go to classes today, and they usually end a little before midday (and my brother and niece were leaving to meet my sister at midday, I had time to tag along), and as I’m walking home -still a little bit hopeful to be with them -I call my brother to ask him to make some rice. He doesn’t answer.

When I get to the apartment and see no one there, I break. I break down because I’m used to not fitting in anywhere, but it doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt. Because they’re my family and I always feel like I’m a nuisance to them. And because if I try to talk to them or my parents about how I feel, I’m usually ignored. If I’m not, then I’m yelled at for “twisting things”.

142,"TLDR; was depressed. Now I’m not. I feel empty and I’ve stopped caring - don’t feel bad - just empty. Looking for advice.

I had depression about 4 years ago - things got more or less as bad as they could get and I almost didn’t make it through. During that time, a ‘bad day’ was a depressive episode that could last for days, weeks or months. A good day was distracting myself for long enough between episodes.

On the other side of it now, and at first I felt so relieved to be free of it and working towards building something again and making time and decisions count.

After time passed though - very much where I am now - I feel virtually nothing. I have different types of good and bad days now. A bad day is taking advantage of not caring about anything to spend more money than I should on something I don’t need or say things I shouldn’t. A good day is the same thing, but to a more productive end (work, for example).

This doesn’t feel like a relapse. I don’t feel like I’m in danger of sliding or spiralling

I’m going through relationships with the kindest, loveliest people and feeling nothing towards them. I’ve stopped feeling guilty about dropping engagements with family and friends. I’m being irrationally confrontational and standoffish.

Maybe I’m overthinking. I just wanted to know if anyone else had come out the other side of depression and just felt empty and blank. Not in a depressive way. It’s like that feeling in the first seconds when you wake up in the morning where nothing is real enough yet, and nothing matters truly until you come to. Difficult to describe 😅

sooo growing up overweight, i used to have these phases of trying to lose weight very rapidly so i used to starve myself for like a few days and undereat for a week. after i hit puberty i lost a lot of weight and got taller so i was no longer 'overweight' yet i my bmi was still around the upper-middle part of the 'healthy/normal' range. 

over this summer, i got really uncomfortable with my appearance. i had already started to hate most of my manners and personality traits so being self-conscious about my appearance was just a cherry on top. i decided to do a 'water fast' for a week like i used to do in middle school. nothing different. after starving myself and obssesively weighing myself multiple times a day it got out if control. 

my fast was over but my mind still told me that i was too fat to eat anything. i limited myself to below 500 calories (300 on some days), occasionally binged and then immediately purged everything i ate. eventually i lost like 15lbs in a month. my bmi is now low-healthy. each day it spiralled more and more out of control and it still does. i became so much more than just trying to lose weight, i started to use it as a self harm method. i starved myself for days until the hunger pains were unbearable and i was blacking out every time i stood up. 

one of my best friends got suspicious so i had to open up to him about it. i could see how much it upsetted him and it destroyed me. i starved more and more because i was a burden on him, i made him sad so i deserved to starve. he started calling me daily to check up on me and tried convincing me to recover. what he is doing is really sweet and thoughtful but i still refuse to cooperate and make him even more upset. 

i still havent hit my goal weight so i dont think i deserve to recover and feel like recovering now will only make all the suffering and pain invalid. i feel like it has affected our friendship a lot bc he doesnt really get how an ed works and blames me for being stubborn and not choosing to do anything when i totally can and then crying about the consequences.
