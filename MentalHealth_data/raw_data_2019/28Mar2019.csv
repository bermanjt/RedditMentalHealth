0,"For the past 2 or so months I've stopped feeling emotions at certain events (it slowly happened then very quickly about 2 months ago). Anyways, I've noticed when I'm alone I'll feel an emotion and show the physical symptoms but not know why, if someone just told me bad news I can infer but my head is clear of emotion. If I'm around other people sometimes they'll say ""why are you nervous"" or something like that. Then I'll pay attention and notice I'm bouncing my leg, my throat is dry, and I'm sweating (I've been diagnosed with anxiety). The entire time I'll feel fine in my head and not even know I'm nervous. I used to actually know why I felt anxious (and the same things that used to make me feel anxious make me act anxious now). It happened really fast, less than a day. Is there anything wrong with that? ",28Mar2019,1
1,I went home from uni for a few days to do all my deadlines but I feel so lonely and unwanted. It’s like I could die and no one would actually care.

2,"I grew up in a household with an emotionally unavailable father who came and went when he pleased. I stopped talking to him when I was 14, right when my mother divorced him. I did have severe panic attacks in high school that at the time I did not realize was being caused by my parental situation. I was paranoid that I had a heart defect and was going to die. I made my mother take me to the doctor and everything. I eventually stopped having panic attacks and the paranoia when I came to college. 

I got into a relationship with someone for 2 years. They dumped me after telling me they never intended to stay with me long term and that I was not ""sexy"" enough. This hurt me very bad, they were a decent partner and I thought I put my best effort. All I want is to find someone to have a normal loving relationship with, not like the one my parents had. 

I did start dating a long time friend who I feel is a better match for me. They express how much they appreciate me and want me in their life. They have told me they loved me and talk about future plans. However, I noticed I started having weird emotional problems.

Sometimes when we talk, they'll use a certain word or phrase which makes me feel like they don't  want to be with me. I know deep down inside its irrational, but a part of me is telling me to be suspicious. This causes me to have episodes that often last for hours where I have detailed intrusive thoughts of my partner leaving me or hurting me in some way. I get to the point where I feel very sick to my stomach and stay in my room to cry or obsess over it. I have not told them about this because I don't want them to think I'm crazy. But, sometimes these episodes have caused me to anxiously confront them about it. Every time I do this, they act confused as to why I seem worried and tell me my interpretation of what they said is wrong or was incorrectly treated as truth when they were just hypothetically speaking. 

I have very bad thoughts in my head that tell me things like ""leave the relationship before you get hurt, things are not looking good"" or ""you should hate them, they're gonna leave you like the others"". 

I'm not sure what to do. I'm trying my best to keep myself contained and not bother my partner for constant validation or explanation of their words and actions.

3,"I have some pretty bad depression, and I do tend to focus on the negative parts of my life. But, I know I'm not wrong when I say a lot of my days are gloomy. I have a very caring and sweet boyfriend, who always is trying to help. I do a lot to try and help myself, pills, therapy, going out and doing things, getting enough sleep and water. But, I can go days without my pills or weeks without therapy and my mood doesnt change a bit. My boyfriend is the light at the end of the tunnel for me, he makes me happy and he makes me feel better.

But, when I get sad, he gets sad too. He tries as hard as he can to help, but no one and nothing can break the fog in my head. I've been trying and trying to tell him that he is more than enough for me and he is a perfect partner for me, but he just cant shake the thought that he's useless. I try really hard to tell him nothing really helps but I dont know what to do anymore. I dont know what to say to make him understand that he means so much to me, even if he cant help my depression.",28Mar2019,1

7,"So, I’ve been going downhill recently. I haven’t been officially diagnosed for anxiety. But I feel that I have it because of how I react to things and how my body reacts to things when I’m having problems. I’ve been trying to work on it myself because I don’t want to be seen as crazy or lazy by my parents and boyfriend. I’m tired of it affecting my day to day life and relationships though.

8,"Over the past few weeks, I’ve come to realize that part of being an adult also means confronting the fact that people who you know and love, or at the very least, used to look up to—they very well might hide Skelton’s in their closets. Perhaps you find out that the person who you’re engaged to hates LGBTQ people, or that a kind mentor you looked up to hates you as a person. As family and health issues have slowly cropped up, the most painful reality of my adulthood was that the people currently surrounding me are apathetic at best. 

And I’m thankful for it. I push myself that much harder. If a teacher wishes to sponsor some student rather than me, I’ll push myself into being more self-sufficient. If a friend turns a blind eye when I try to ask a question or reach out for help, then I’ll buy a damn diary. At the end of the day, I’ll live with being my best friend and greatest critic. That’s just the way life for me is. Thank you guys for listening.",28Mar2019,2

10,"The formatting for this might be bad- I apologize in advance.

As the title says, I'm worried about my dad. We're decently close, and we get on well most of the time. We both deal with anxiety issues and I know he has dealt with depression in the past. I think his mental health has been bad for quite a while, and it may be getting worse.

He has worked at the same job for close to 30 years. He works for a public television station, and although his official title is engineer, he doesnt consider himself to be a ""real"" engineer. Im pretty sure he hates his job. It has gotten to the point that he says hes happiest when hes not at work. He has become my example of what I dont want to be like when I'm in the work force.

Every single day he comes home tired and unhappy. He used to be lively, silly, goofy, but now none of that remains. All that's left is basically Bob Parr from the Incredibles when he was working at InsuraCare. Honestly, that's pretty much who my dad is at this point.

13,"Okay so this might take a while to explain but I’m really struggling right now and I don’t know what to do. Please someone bear with me.

Backstory of my mental health: I have been struggling with anxiety since I was a child and I think I might have depression now but that’s not the point. Basically I just feel like everything is overwhelming and I want to be alone all the time, just disconnect from everything and everyone, stay in my room all day. But the thing is being alone with my thoughts scares me sometimes, cause if I am not distracted I start thinking about everything that’s is going on in the world and have a panic attack. It’s not fun.

The thing is, I have a boyfriend who I love very much, but he just causes me more problems. See, he is transgender, and he struggles really bad with depression and anxiety caused by his dysphoria and is suicidal. He’s been like this ever since I’ve known him, but lately it’s been worse. Whenever I try to spend time with him to cheer him up, he ignores me and tells me to shut up or things like that. His mental state causes him to be mean to me and his friends, I know he self harms, and I can’t do anything about it. Seeing him hurting like this hurts me even more. I spend a lot of my energy in helping him overcome his anxiety, whether it be in class, with school projects, etc. I know he doesn’t have that energy to give back to me, so it feels like I’m giving everything I have for nothing. I spend my heart and soul into trying to make him feel better, since he doesn’t do it for himself, and then I hope he will do it for me, which he can’t.

I am not happy in my relationship, I don’t feel like I am helping myself at all with my own issues. But there is no way in hell I can break up with him, I know for a fact I am one of the only things that motivates him to stay alive. I want to be free from the burden of carrying two people’s problems on my back, but without leaving him behind to die, you know? I have no idea what to do. Please someone help me. ",28Mar2019,1
14,"I’m a freshman in college and recently I’ve been told that I’m really grabby. That’d be fine, because all of my friends have repeatably said that they’re okay with it, but I’ve really started to notice that without realizing it I’m always trying to touch someone. There’s absolutely nothing sexual about it, I love my friends but not like that.
It’s mostly casual, like hugging people when we greet or say goodbye, but it’s also things like holding hands if we’re sitting next to each other or just generally always being in physical contact with someone. Again, it’s not sexual.
I spent a week at one of their houses because I’m from foster care and have no intention of going back to anyone from that time in my life who offered, so again, nothing sexual. Their mom commented on how grabby I was, and pointed out that in any other context it would definitely be perceived as something different.

I don’t want to make anyone uncomfortable and this is definitely something that I realize could become an issue, because some people really don’t like to be touched and I think I might accidentally be making them uncomfortable at points.
Is this a mental health issue on my part or just a bad habit? Because if this is something that’s better discussed professionally as part of a larger disorder I would like to get help right away.",28Mar2019,2
15,"Hello, all. I'm not sure if I'm mentally ill or not, but I just need a place to vent because I feel like I'm in a constant state of fighting failure. I'm 18 and, as my life begins to form, I find myself terrified of the future. I do not want to fail. I have one life and I want to do everything in my power to be successful and not waste it. I only have one shot at going to the college I want, one shot at law school, one shot at a career, one shot at a relationship, and, when I reach the end, I want to be able to reflect on the past and say that I was productive and did something meaningful. And that future reflection is what I want to make positive and not dreadful. I seem to psychoanalyze everything and everyone, and I hate doing it. I draw up pictures and realities about other people and tell myself that I cannot become whatever they failed in doing, but, at the same time, there's this inner-feeling that I will never escape an inevitable future of mediocrity where I won't be significant. On top of this, I feel like I can't properly express my emotions. Nothing physical actually makes me sad, only thoughts of the future - of failure, of losing loved ones, losing my potential.

17,"I'm agoraphobic among my many other fun to live with issues. It's a long arduous mental buildup for me to leave the house. Today I got my shit together to go to the store and get dinner for my family. That didn't happen. As I was walking towards the shop, a man on a moped got demolished by a Honda CRV in the middle of the street. I am trained as a first responder from my younger, less anxiety riddled youth and immediately dropped all my shit and booked out into the middle of the street. I can't get the image I saw out of my head. The man's head split open like a ripe cantalope and was pissing blood. My training kicked in and we did everything we could to help this guy, but I'm not sure if he made it to the hospital. I was covered in blood. Once the adrenaline wore off and I gave my shaky statement to the cops and they helped me wash my hands, I started to mentally break down. That was about 4 hours ago. Now I'm here.

20,"Hello all, as the title suggests I've had a lot of trouble with driving. From the very start I had bad anxiety when it came to driving, I failed my test almost twice. I've gotten into two accidents within the first year. I really used to not have much confidence at all. 

I was getting much better. My confidence was riding, then my depression started effecting my driving ability. I started getting panic attacks and getting scared to drive because I was scared that I was going to run my vehicle off the road. So I stopped driving for a little bit. 

I've been doing alright with driving again, I'm not the best but I haven't been in accidents since. I've been okay with the intrusive thoughts. However, tonight I scared myself again. While I was driving I started to kind of feel like I didn't have control over myself. I don't know how to describe it. I felt like I was in a daze and the car felt very weird and foreign. I felt like I didn't have much control at all. I don't know what happened. This was accompanied by some intrusive thoughts, but I can't really remember because my brain felt fuzzy. 

Can anyone please tell me what happened? Or can anyone give me advice on how to deal with my struggles?

I had a baby a while back and ever since, I feel like I'm too fat to leave my house. I'm not huge, but I went from being really thin (125lb) to 175lb. So it's definitely a huge change for me. 

I feel like I'm too fat and ugly to leave my house. Whenever I leave to go to work (which is basically the only time I leave my house), I make sure my hair is done and my makeup is done completely. It takes me like 2 hours before I'm happy with how I look. And I still look at the floor when I walk because I don't want to make eye contact with anyone and attract attention to myself.

I walk quickly because I'm afraid of people talking to me because I'm just sure they're going to be nasty or make fun of me. It's a really weird feeling.

I know from how my coworkers and people I'm comfortable with react to me that I'm not disgusting looking... I just can't get out of my own head about these things.

I'll think, ""Today is the day."" I'll get dressed to go somewhere different and stop at the door and when I'm in public, I get lightheaded and my hands shake.

28,"Despite the title, this is a serious post. Humor is the only coping mechanism I know :) 

This is my first time posting because I've always been too scared of reaching out. I have never been diagnosed with anything but I have struggled with my mental health throughout high school.

I am in my first year of college and I am having an awful time, especially this semester. I am in a really hard major and not doing well, I can't seem to make any friends and those that I do have I end up pushing away (usually unintentionally). I used to rely heavily on my parents but now I feel like I'm annoying them too. Recently, my family got into a huge argument which is probably going to end my parent's marriage. Every time I try to help myself I end up making everything worse. No matter how hard I try I can't do better. I used to eat really healthy, go to the gym almost everyday and take good care of myself and lately it's getting increasingly more difficult to even brush my teeth in the morning. The more I try to get out of this rut the more I feel like I sink into it. I overthink and dwell on every little thing and I don't know how to make myself stop. I am very hard on myself and am constantly beating myself up for the smallest things. Every week I say this is just a bad week until it happens week after week.

I don't know who to talk to but I do know that I am really struggling. My motivation is gone, I push everyone away and my head is always going a million miles an hour. I'm not myself anymore. It has gotten to the point where I hope something tragic happens and I die so I don't have to deal with anything anymore. I just don't want to live in this head anymore.

I also don't hate anyone either, I just feel as if im the only one who feels this way.
 I might care to an extent but, im sure it isn't love, just based off what I've observed from others. If a friend/family member had died I would not be sad, might be glad depending on who it is. Or meeting new people, after a while they might see me as a friend/love interest but, I never feel the same way.

Now that im older I try to do things that would induce the feelings others achieve such as love. Like getting married, having a family, life-long friendships, trips, etc. I try to talk with my therapist about such things but, I don't think she understands me very well.

But in the past week it has gotten unbearable. It has been keeping me from eating or doing certain things.
It started getting bad when I wanted to masturbate. For a few days it told me I couldn't or bad things would happen, so I didn't. And then I did. That night, I vomitted.
Now I cannot do ANYTHING without it telling me something bad will happen.
For example, this morning I was having waffles. I picked up the syrup but then in my head it was like ""You can't have the syrup."" And I COULDN'T eat it. It's so frustrating. I couldn't eat Oreos today. I have a dinner roll next to me that I want to eat but I can't.
It keeps telling me that it's God and that's the most upsetting part. I feel like this is punishment. I don't know how long I can deal with this.

What I meant for “except for a few” was very few times I’m starting directly at it and I can see it although when I do check to see if there was something using more logic thought there’s nothing there.

I dismissed it as merely my imagination figuring the janitors closet is always open when someone is in there. The other more terrifying one happened a couple months ago. I was sitting in bed try to get to sleep when I saw a giant spider (about 20cm wide) coming down from the ceiling and just crawled on my bed which is when I screamed and turned the lights back on only to see nothing there.These are the more terrifying ones the others just are in the sides of my vision although still nerve racking. I’m scared to turn the lights off. They only happen when it’s dark well except the janitors closet one.. Is this normal? I really don’t know.. Does everyone experience this? Am I the only one?,28Mar2019,2

They managed to find a place on my right hand but it took them quite a while. It was super painful and I could tell they were concerned with how long it was taking since they stopped trying to distract me.

I’ve always gotten existential every now and then but lately it’s been on my mind every day. The mystery of what is past it scares me. I don’t mean to bring up any religious discussion but faith makes me want to believe that there is eternal life but I don’t want eternal life. When I think of forever and never ending I get really anxious and scared. I feel like I’m stuck in some never ending timeline that I can’t do anything about.

37,"for about 2 weeks and a half now i havent felt the same when it came to doing things, I dont get emotional as easy or feel the same level of concern as I used to. I tend to overthink about it and wonder if I'll ever get back to how I used to be and it makes me panic. I feel a little okay when I'm at school or playing q game but when I'm not its constantly stressful because i feel like I'm just not normal or acting normal or feeling normal. It almost feels like I'm just suppressed.

I wanted to go to a therapist but that idea scares me even more because then I could have something or get medicine and then never go back to how I was, and if I'm just overthinking and it all goes away it will be all for naught

I'm really scared and this is the first time in my life where I'm feeling this way. it's almost like my personality has been put on shutdown and I am just stressed whenever I'm not distracted by something.

Not only that, but I can't even handle the mention of death or even ageing without feeling supreme fear.

September-December 2013, I was in Vietnam, hoping to live my dreams: to give back by teaching English and learning about my culture, language, and family. Instead, I was drugged, raped, and shaken by corruption.

I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, PTSD, and now sleep apnea because of pedophiles, car accidents, deaths, addictions, etc. even BEFORE ""The Incident."" I lost my languages, cultures, and pride on my Vietnamese AND Native side because of intergenerational trauma from the Vietnam War and colonialism. My dad was a Vietnam War Refugee and my grandma is a Residential School Survivor.

I struggled with internalized racism and being a ""normal Canadian."" As much as I wanted nothing to do with it then, I want my cultures back more than ever. Why? To make things right before passing it onto the next generation. 

October 29, 2017, this photo was taken while my husband's dad was still recovering, and on the 4 year anniversary of The Incident. I still have mixed feelings about churches and religion.

I wish people believed me and helped sooner, but how could they when I was taught to keep quiet, and they were, and so on, ""or else?"" I still get triggered when people judge and ask, ""why didn't your family teach you our language?"" I wish I could simply tell them.

He only uses me to talk about himself, and he obviously just wants to be complimented and comforted. He shows no interest in what I say whatsoever. But god I love him. 

I don’t know why I do. Maybe it’s because I want to protect him and be like a father figure. Maybe it’s because he’s the only one who can look at my face and not be obviously disgusted by me. Maybe it’s because he’s the only person who responds when I talk to him. 

I want to be with him, but I’ll never have a chance. I’ve tried leaving him and cutting him out of my life but he told me to stay, and I don’t have anyone else to talk to. 

He always talks about girls and his exs. He talks about how beautiful they are, how much he loves them, how much he wants to have kids and a wife and be married. Whenever he talks about that I am torn between sobbing and imagining how much I would enjoy being his husband and having a family with him.

* I can look at an instruction sheet, and will completely mangle the highlighted (circled, underlined, and passively-aggressively written 3x in bold sharpie across the page, because my coworkers think I'm not reading it) - instructions if someone so much as talks to me, or there's an interesting conversation I'm overhearing, or I get sidetracked by an unrelated line of thought, or I try to multi-task the first step. Literally anything/everything will result in me executing the wrong set of instructions that I just read 0.5 seconds ago to 20 seconds ago. I think my instruction set memory is incapable of lasting more than 60 seconds. By force of habit I have to check the instruction sheet every minute, or after every step, to insure I don't fuck it up. If someone asks me to do something after my current task, I am just as likely to not remember after finishing my first task as the interruption is to result in me fucking up something on my current task
* Struggle to not look like I'm half-assing my current task, where the harder I focus on some aspects the less I appear to be aware of other aspects
* Can only remember what I'm going to say, or focus on what a person is saying, but rarely both. Thinking of multiple things I want to say or address while the other person is speaking will make me forget some, lose track of the conversation, or send me into a mental blackhole of an imaginary tangential conversation before popping back into reality. My father is infamous for ""talking in circles"" without ever reaching any of the points he wanted to make, and I often can't either with half a dozen tangents beating on my mental door whenever I want to talk.

* Was bullied a lot as a kid, being ""too nice"" and forgiving with aggressors
* All my classmates and coworkers have thought I'm high on weed 24/7 since I was in gradeschool
* Inexplicably can't insert myself into a conversation without causing a trainwreck. Paradoxically can't get people's attention but am often accused of ignore people?
* Paradoxically being annoying in which I'm trying to have normal conversation, or ""being a good listener and supportive friend"" in which I'm actually mentally clocking out and going into some kind of ""autopilot"" mode
* Family history of alcoholism, compulsive gambling, kleptomania, childhood behavioral problems
* Motor tics when excited. Usually rubbing hands together. I see this one in people with neurological disorders. I outgrew this in my mid 20's, my sibling still does it.

49,"I’ve been planning for a while. I had everything planned, and it was finally time. I sat down and wrote the letter.  It wasn’t anything incredibly profound.  Mostly I just really, really, really wanted to tell my family and friends that it wasn’t their fault that I killed myself and that I was so sorry that I was so weak. That they were wonderful, that they couldn’t have done anything differently, I was just too tired to keep going. 

I reminded them of when Dad was sick - he was diagnosed with cancer, fought as hard as he could, did all the treatments - and it spread anyway. I said remember how even though we wanted him to stay, we didn’t him to stay and suffer? It’s like that. I’ve tried so, so hard. Did the hospitals and the therapy and the meds and it’s just kept going. I failed. I’m sorry I was so weak.

Then, in the letter, I spoke to my kids. I told them that they are amazing and that I love them and that if I could watch over them after I was dead that I would and that they are the best kids EVER and this was not because of them.

And then I sat there. And thought about my kids reading it.  I couldn’t do it. I shredded the letter and flushed the pills. I’m not going to judge people who die by suicide because I can’t really explain how much living hurts. I really don’t know how I am going to get better. Ever. Things seem so hopeless. And I am so -so- fucking tired. 

But I thought of how broken my heart was when Dad died, and thought that I can’t imagine what it would have been like if he chose to leave when he did. 

I’m so scared right now, and so tired, and so damn broken, but tonight I decided to stay and I just needed to tell someone. Not looking for a gold star or anything, just a place to talk as I don’t want to dump this on my friends or family since they’ve put up with enough. Thanks for listening. ",28Mar2019,27

51,"So, this post will be 2 things.

I really don't know how to explain it. For so long I've thought about doing it, but every time I have always just failed to harm myself, until yesterday. I managed to cut my wrist. I've counted it, it was about 23, about half of them caused significant bleeding.

Enough about specifics lol. I mainly wanted to vent some feeling I've had over it. When I actually did it, and I watched it start to open, I felt proud. Like I made some accomplishment of sorts. I shared it with my friend, flaunting it like a trophy. You could say I might have been just delirious I guess, but the fact I felt like that scares me. Now I feel embarrassed over it. It's just dumb. Thankfully my friends on discord put one ounce of rationalization into my head or I might have gone farther.

I washed it with soap and hot water for a good amount of time, so it was fine. It kept bleeding for a while, I didn't really keep track or pay attention to it. I tried wearing my jacket to hide it from my family.

But funnily enough, when 3am came around, I stood up, and when I went to the sink, my ears popped, a loud ass ringing started going, and everything was going black. I could barely keep myself from falling, I don't know how I got anywhere, I was just spamming from one place to the next, on my brothers door, to the dog gate in the hallway that I practically just ran right through. The weirdest part is, at least to my recollection of the event, I was seeing things as images, not like how you'd view things in real life. I was calling whoever I could for help, but when I was, and I wanted to yell, I could barely say anything, it was like I was sapped of the energy for it. In addition when I did that I sounded like I had a hand over my mouth cause of my hearing. All of what was going through my head was, I was about to die. I was genuinely feeling I was about to die. I don't know how to explain that emotion, because it's probably worse than anything I've ever felt. And it's the reason I'm committed to making myself better now.

I ended up on my mom's bed and she was there just honestly speaking like I was dying. according to my brother I was extremely pale and sweating. It was so weird. idk. it's all just so weird, I'm not sure what to feel. I guess relief is the best way to put it. Relief that all this is just over. 

I'm not sure if what happened was just a thing of my depression, blood loss, or a bit of both. But it scared the living shit out of me.

anyway, thats my little deal that happened. my wristsl is healing naturally, but I'm just so embarrassed over it, as far as family goes. Shame, is a better way to put it.",28Mar2019,4

54,"TL/DR: None of the advice I’ve tried to use from a counselor actually works. Should I be concerned?

Over the past 4 years or so, I’ve been dealing with a lot of my own stuff (of which I won’t get into too much detail about). More recently, in the past year or so, I’ve felt really slowed down. I don’t find a lot of joy doing what I’ve done before, struggle with any positive outlooks, keep falling behind in school, I oversleep, yadayada. I don’t even feel like dabbling in photography anymore which used to be my absolute favorite hobby. 
It was this school year, around October, when a teacher of mine became worried about how I was doing in their class and they suggested I visit our school’s student specialist (pretty much a counselor on a lower pay grade). This got me working closely with the specialist, whom we can call Jackson. I’ve gone to visit him about once a week and we’ve always talked through different things and worked on finding me a way of coping/getting past what I’ve struggled with for so long. Over the time I’ve spent with Jackson, we’ve tried many different methods of distracting myself from the issues, changing my mindset, creating exercise routines, you name it we’ve done it. The issue is, nothing I’ve tried and attempted to stick to ever works.
As I keep falling along this path of fumbling for an answer and trying to stop myself from going farther (which always seems to be consuming me more), I’m starting to realize that I’m out of luck to try anything and I really don’t know what’s going to fix my problems or at least stop the descent. Should I be really worried if I can’t change what’s happening even if I throw all of the energy I have left into it?

On a side note, I’ve been trying to stop my suicidal thoughts for about 2 years and that’s probably not good. I don’t want to tell Jackson because that’s going to put me into a farther pitfall with my parents and other people than I’m already dealing with. Thoughts?",28Mar2019,1
55,"Months ago I joined a mental health advocacy using storytelling group and just a couple of days ago I was casually asked if I wanted to join a radio segment to promote the group and our cause. On a whim I said yes and that was my first mistake. My story that I had been developing is exclusively meant for a crowd of strangers that I would never have to see again, not a very popular live radio station. I’m so dumb. My story has stuff about my sister attempting suicide and how that affected me and my mental health. This, of course, is a very touchy subject in my family. My family blames me for the attempt and in the 6 years since it happened it’s been brought up maybe twice, though never said explicitly. I never told any of my friends nor tried to talk to anybody about it. I didn’t tell my parents about going on the radio before I did, signing the permission slip required for minors on radio for them. Even then I was scared my mom would call in and yell at me on live radio. I thought nobody would have to know. Just like the past of my family this would be my little secret.

Dumb. That’s what I am. Now there’s no hiding. 40,000 people heard it live, most of them living in my small city, and it’s open for download on the website. What did I expect? I assumed nobody listened to radio anymore and my story would just be lost in the noise of endless media. However, in just the day of the recording three friends have texted me about it, five people mentioned it to my parents, and a couple of people promoted it to other youth groups i’m in. Of course my mother found out just 10 minutes into the session. The link is everywhere and everyone feels like they have complete permission to talk to me about my stories and the details of a past that I’ve kept very close and secretive up until now. I know I don’t have the right because it was I who told it on public radio but I feel trapped and violated.

56,"it’s march 27 and i thought things would get better but it hasn’t. when i tried to write things like this there’s nothing that comes up to my mind. i’m currently feeling really depressed but for some reason in these situations people feel the need to end it all . but i don’t have those suicidal thoughts and i feel like that’s a curse. right now, i feel like im living in eternal hell. i wish there was someone who could understand what i am going through as a teenager. it’s so hard and i’ve tried speaking to adults in my life, but they just kept saying “stop pitying your life so much”, “focus on college… too much distractions in your life… you’re gonna be a failure.” just this year i’ve realized that at a child i went through something that i shouldn’t have gone through. i’ve been in denial for the past 9 years or so… i’m just so scared right now because my mom and my aunt is protecting my abuser whom i have spoken out about. my mom thinks i might have imagine it because i was a child and that it was too traumatizing. but then she changed her mind saying ""my abuser didn’t mean it, he was just a couple year older than me when it happened so he didn’t know better."" and to myself i’m like well i guess it’s my fault. i blame myself for what had happened, i don’t know i wish i could have done something as a child. and the past few days i’ve been experiencing depressive episodes that have been impacting my life. it’s gotten to the point that i feel so unmotivated to go to school, do any of my schoolwork, and i just feel so hopeless… sometimes i might get lucky, and one day i’ll wake up really happy and hyper. but in this instance, that’s not happening. but my mood could change so dramatically just by the simplest negative thing. i might be experiencing a manic episode but that could change in an instant when someone doesn’t text me back, or a friend of mine just accidentally ignores me. these little negative things i shouldn’t mind is somehow so impactful to me? i just don’t get it… the ironic thing is i don’t really care of what people think of me, i’ve gone public about my mental health and trauma so many times. people have known my story, but as i walk through the hallways my paranoia starts acting up. i hear my name in people’s voices but I KNOW for a fact that they’re not talking about me, and that my brain is just playing me. i can’t talk to a therapist because my aunt and mom are scared that they might take legal action on the whole situation. i’m just so overwhelmed and i feel trapped…. i don’t know why the thing is my trauma doesn’t really make me sad, but when i’m experiencing these depressive episodes, it does have an  impact on me… i just don’t get it, like on a regular day it might come to my thought and i would just brush it off. like i don’t mind it. anyways both my aunt and mom thinks i’m throwing my life away because of the past few days but comparing to the past 2 years of my high school career, i’ve never been like that before. and just because of a few day of being like this, they think i’m going to become a high school dropout… also, i’m in constant blame of myself because my aunt keeps telling me how selfish i am for feeling this way and not think about my mom. i wish sometimes i could have my innocence again and not have gained this knowledge. i’ve experienced many other things in my life, this is just one of them…. I wish I had the courage to talk to you about this in person, but explaining my emotions in person is so hard for me that sometimes people just misinterpret the whole thing. Also, most of the time I just feel so bad for bothering you and wasting your time. I appreciated you so much for comforting me on Wednesday , thank you (: . Maybe, that's why I'm finally reaching out to you because apart of me trusts you now. it's such a relief to write it all down but I've done this before so many time,  I have a public diary and people take notice of it.

57,"So I go to a sixth form where only one of my friends from high school went, that one friend ended up finding new friends and leaving me behind. I made a couple of friends but I wouldn’t consider them close friends, my only real friends have a job or go to the sixth form that my high school had. If you don’t know what sixth form is, it’s the last two years of school in the UK where you take your A levels.
I made one good friend at sixth form who experienced the same as I am and decided to leave over it, so I’m feeling kind of alone.
I’m becoming really depressed over this and have missed a lot of days so going in is stressful as there’s a lot to catch up on.
They know there’s a problem and my mam is going to see them tonight but I know they won’t be able to do anything about it, because, like I said before, my friend experienced the same thing and had to leave.
I don’t want to leave cause I’ll probably regret it in a few years when I’m stuck working some shitty job for minimum wage but I feel like if I don’t leave I will end up killing myself. Before going to sixth form I had a couple of episodes of depression but they didn’t last long, but now it’s ongoing for months, worse than ever before, I started cutting myself and thinking of suicide, I just feel trapped.
I can’t decided whether or not I should leave because of this, my friend that left says she feels better now that she did, but I don’t know if I would feel the same.

I just feel tired and down and ready to give up and just walk away from it all. I have also been frustrated as I dont get time to my self and I dont get to go out and hang with other people my age. With working 75 hours or more and going to school part time it's hard.
So what shold I do?

I'm working on going in to another field to see if that helps but Im worry if it wont. So any thought on how to make it stop or what have you? Do I need to talk to some one or not? Or should I just walk away from the job?",28Mar2019,1
60,"Growing up with a mentally unstable mother is probably one of the hardest things to cope with because it’s something that never gets better, and has continuously been a vicious cycle of getting better, and then worse again.

Long story short, my mom is a mentally unstable veteran that was medically discharged only after a few years of service that’s really fucked her up. She had a rough childhood on top of that, but she dealt with some messed up stuff when she served for the marines. 
She ended up having five kids (I’m the middle child) but I only have one full blooded sibling. 
But her mental health has really kinda messed us all up in our own way.

She was always suicidal while I was growing up (still is to this day), and was extreme about it, but it’s used more to gas light when she can’t deal with confrontation on lying or telling people different things to stir the pot for no reason. She was diagnosed with BPD and PTSD, on top of her being in the beginning stages of dementia. 

She recently convinced me to move in with her before I leave the country for a few months this fall(work related) to save money and help her out around the house. My 16yo sister, we will call her Nicole, is at my moms half the time, at her dads half the time. She prefers to be here at my moms now that I’m here because I’m basically the guardian angel that saves the day. My mom likes to take out her problems on us kids, and it’s not fair. I always try to protect my little sister from it because I don’t want her to witness it all.

My mom has regular appointments at the VA.  Mostly counseling and what not, but it helps. She’s on different medications to help with her illness, but she’s not good at ‘taking them’.
Every couple weeks she goes through stages where she gets paranoid thinking everyone is trying to manipulate her to become robotic on these medications. And then she starts doing the stuff like hurting herself, and telling one person she’s taking her meds and one person she isn’t . And then she starts gas lighting when you try to even talk to her calmly, it’s almost like continuously walking on egg shells. 

She gets to points where she doesn’t listen, and will say everyone is attacking her when we try to help. Today it got really, really bad. To the point where I wasn’t saying anything, I was trying to disengage so she had no fuel. And she drove off, disappeared with the car, and left my little sister stranded at school and was gone for hours. I found a way to pick up my little sister and get her home safely. We left to my friends house just a block up so I could safely call the VA to get advice on what to do. We got back and she still wasn’t home, but eventually came back.

While I was on the phone with the VA, after being directed to 10 different people, I was told they can’t do anything. Even if she harms herself and we call the cops, they won’t do anything because she has done this so many times for ‘attention’ is what they called it that they will not do anything if it’s not a suicide attempt. And I was told it’s more dangerous to call the cops and provoke her than to just ignore it and leave it alone. What??? I get it but you think after so many times, years of this, and still no help?? All they can do is send someone to do a wellness check, and even then they literally won’t do anything unless she is literally almost dead from pulling something like this. 
I had brought up maybe family counseling and the woman was like “yeah make an appointment and just tell her it’s made and that she can go or she can stay. But you need to take care of you. “ and I’m like well duh, but also my sister? And my mom?? And when can I schedule? 
She then goes “oh you do realize I can’t do that, you have to seek help outside the VA we can only counsel her.” 

At this point I’m dumb founded. And the USA’s mental health awareness sucks. And I’ve gone to so much counseling, and I literally only have months before I leave my job but I want my mom to be good before I go because of my sister. But it’s something that will never get better. My sisters dad knows everything but doesn’t really give a shit. And the VA is the literal fucking worst. And I’m so exhausted I feel like I’m living in constant purgatory but if I stop my sister suffers and she doesn’t deserve it. I get my lucky break in September, but my sister still has a whole year after that before she can legally be on her own and done with the 50/50 custody between both mom and her dad. 

I feel like this post is everywhere because I’m really emotional. But I’m at a fucking loss. I’m basically at a point where I literally have to walk in on my mom almost dead and in the process of committing suicide for anyone to step in and help here. There’s not enough help for mental health here and it sucks. I’m pretty strong, but it’s fake strong. I just disassociate and feel like I’m stuck in purgatory and I have like no emotion left but just weight. Just like a ton of weight on my chest and shoulders and I have no energy to do anything. I don’t know what to do.",28Mar2019,6
61,She’s not right in the head. Her entire family knew it and refused to commit her to an asylum. They let her roam free and she’s ruined every relationship she’s been in. Nobody can put up with her. Just like nobody can put up with me. She ruined me mentally and emotionally. My entire life she’s abused me and through this abuse molded me into a clone of hers. I hate being this way. I hate thinking like she does. I hate having the same episodes that she does. I hate that I’ll be just minding my business and an intrusive memory from over a decade ago resurfaces and I feel the same emotions I felt back then. I have to deal with it again and again and again. I know she does the same because we’ll be talking about something completely unrelated and she’ll break down in tears over a bad childhood memory. I can barely deal with it myself as it is but having to deal with her bs too brings me to my breaking point. My life is unliveable. I know how she thinks because it’s the way I think. The only difference between us is 10 points of IQ. I’m smarter than her but I can’t stop acting like her. I can recognize the problem but do nothing about it. It’s frustrating and infuriating. I hurt people I love because I’m just like her. My father whom after all he’s done to me I still care about. And I hurt him and now I feel guilt. I want to stop being my mothers creation. I want to stop hurting the few people I have left. ,28Mar2019,3

Just got off the phone with the doctor and he diagnosed me with depression and social anxiety.
He also scheduled an appointment with a psychologist (I'm not sure that's the right name..)

63," 

I really hope to find some help here because this situation is stresing me out a lot.

Background info: i met this guy in 2013 and we had a FWB relationship for a bit more than half a year, then continued to meet up as friends regularely untill our contact just slowly died off. Not for any specific reason, our lives just took us different ways. I think the last time i‘ve seen him was late 2015 or early 2016 and we haven‘t had much contact except some „hey, how are you“-texts every couple of months. Nevertheless, he has a place in my heart and i want him to be alright.

Now as for what happend: two days ago i get a text from him out of the blue in the midle of the night where he asks me if any suspicious looking people ever approached me and asked questions about him. Apparently he had remembered that such a thing had happend when we were meeting up for a coffee in an other town some years ago. I think i would remember such an incident and was very confused by this so i asked what this was about.

He proceeds to tell me that apparently the police are out to get him. Because they had tried to recruit him as an agent when he was a child and since that was a major fuck up they now try to „deal with it“. I expressed my confusion and he tells me that apparently his dad was in on it too, that they wanted him as an agent because children are more easy to manipulate and he had now withdrawn from social contact because he fears that the police will bother his friends then too. Apparently that had already happend. He also said that it‘s an unsolvable problem because he doesn not want to have any other contact with them than written or trough a lawyer and they don‘t want to cooperate in that.

As much as i want to believe that this story is true, i highly doubt it and i‘m afraid that he is not in a good place mentally, maybe even going trough psychosis (don‘t wanna diagnose, i‘m not the doctor here, he is). I really want to help him but the thing is, we now live pretty far apart, i can‘t just go and check on him, we also haven‘t seen each other in a long time. I don‘t know who his friends or family or who the people close to him are so i don‘t know who to contact here.

I have contacted one of his friends over facebook (the only one he has a recent picture with) and she has recieved similar messages. She is however currently on an other continent and therefore also geographically not able to help. I have figured out where he works but i do not want to contact his job with my concerns, since i don‘t think i‘m in the position to do so.

Please reddit, what the fuck do i do? He is isolating himself because something is after him. He used to be this fun and outgoing guy when we were hanging out. I am worried that he will harm himself or even others. I don‘t know if i‘m overthinking this, i probably am. I don‘t even know if what he tells is fiction or not, i am just so confused. I just want him to be alright and happy. How can i help him?

Sorry for the grammar (english is not my first language), the formatting (am on mobile) and the confusion (am confused).

tl;dr: get confusing messages from a guy i havent seen in years, am worried that he might not be in a good place mentally.",28Mar2019,0

It's now getting to the point where it's getting in the way of making any improvements; we made small, manageable plans for him to develop his hobby, something he has been sad to not make more progress with, and when the time came he refused, insisting he can't. He recently interviewed for a job that he had a great knowledge base for and the reason he relayed to me for not getting it is he was severely under confident. He lets everything frustrate him, he engages in a lot of self destructive behaviour which is then more reason to hate himself. He refuses to see a counsellor. I don't know what to do.",28Mar2019,1

I moved away from home to go to school, so I don't know anyone around where I live. During my first trimester I was completely fine studying and doing assessments, I was happy doing what I usually do in my free time. The trimester break was a month long, had no studying to do. So I worked and had my birthday party. But now that I've come back to school I can't do homework for more than 15 minutes without watching Youtube or a Tv series.

71,"Most of the time, I feel pretty in control. I sleep a lot, work at night in a bar, I can be sulky and have extremely low energy, but broadly I am popular and nice to people. Then every so often I go into this kind of hyperdrive. This time I decided to make a list of the behaviors I exhibit.  


I have these periods of a few days, at irregular intervals, where these behaviours arise, I wonder if they are an indicator of some kinda of bipolar disorder but I don't want to google symptoms, because that's a recipe for worry. Any thoughts/observations on this?

&amp;#x200B;

1. Forgetfulness. Lack of focus. Overactive thought processes leading to simple tasks being neglected. Leaving the ladder on the train. Forgetting to lock the doors at work.
2. Emotional volatility, quick to anger and laughter, giggles.
3. Snapping wide awake after only six hours sleeps. As opposed to other times when I can easily sleep ten hours, and continually go back to sleep after waking.
4. High energy, motivation to carry out multiple activities in a day, whereas often I will struggle to find the motivation to leave the house.
5. Extremely distractible, circular thought patterns.
6. Little short-term memory.
7. Sociability, chattiness.
8. NO CALM MOMENTS
9. When I speak, the intonation and tone are unpredictable. Words come out sounding like somebody else’s voice.
10. Talking too much, babbling, talking almost unconsciously and saying things I don’t intend.
11. Incessant nail-biting
12. Shortness of breath, the need to take consciously deep breaths.

Woke up early af to ring the doctors today as I need my tablets (ran out last night - yes It seems I've left it late but I've just changed doctors, only got registered properly yesterday) anyways they're closed....

This has set me off something bad, idk why. I have had quite a few meltdowns before when things get overwhelming, bad stuff happens (and I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel), I cannot control my emotions when I need to, they just come out...


I've not been diagnosed with anything other than depression, chronic anxiety &amp; panic disorder and bpd so I have no answer for my meltdowns, just questions &amp; ponders on what's wrong with me... 


At the moment (for the past 3 hours) I've been crying, can't stay still, kicking/moving my legs/arms without really being able to help it atall(extremely strong urges to do so.. But now I've calmed abit I don't feel this urge so much) , I've reacted to every little noise I hear, my head is foggy and even now I've calmed down a little I still feel like I'm on the verge of tears &amp; melting down again - I just feel so sensitive like anything could set me off again.... (just heard a noise which has slightly set me off again..) 


Idk what to do, my doctors are closed and even then they don't listen to me regarding anything. I feel so alone, I feel like I'm just like a child having a tantrum but I honestly don't wanna feel like this, there's no show for anyone to see as I live alone

75,"There was this nerdy boy in our school. I met him in 2014.  Let’s call him T.  He was always bullied by my classmates because he was anxious, awkward and a wimp and I was the only one who befriended him. The class would joke about us being f****ts and that T “can’t even find himself a girl”, even after disciplinary action the kids still kept talking shit.  T and I shared common interests, but he was quite reclusive towards me and would get annoyed whenever I tried to stand up for or comfort him because it’s “gay and weird”.  I decided to never bring up his emotional well-being at ALL, his ego was so big it was irritating.  I had a crush on him but never told anyone.  
I don’t think T’s rich ass parents knew what was going on but I visited often and they recognized me as his best and only friend.  
After graduation (2016) T moved out, went to a private college and his social media accounts were all deactivated. He ignored my calls and messages. I was pissed as fuck and decided to give him the same treatment, not that he ever bothered to contact me.  We never talked since then, but suddenly today his parents called to tell me about the funeral time, and told me they found him dead in his room from drug overdose.  

I begged my boss to let me leave work early so I could attend the funeral but he refused to let me because it wasn’t an immediate family member or spouse.   I just got back and sitting here wondering what the fuck I should do. I never got to say goodbye, I never got to tell him he didn’t deserve getting shat on, he must have thought i hated him, and I feel like if I had talked to him everyday he would still be alive.  I wasn’t there for him when he was alive and I’m not there for him when he’s passed.

I literally thought up a personality that is interesting, up beat and out going, happy etc so I could make friends. I had fun but after finishing high school I felt like, everything isnt worth it. I hated highschool despite getting along with people that I unironically also hate. I knew I was fake but, idk.

Just after graduating I feel like I've been in a really empty place, I forgot me and stuff like that. But after a few months I kinda picked myself up, cleaned my room and all those things. Then I figured, this was the time I will ""find myself"". I tried being myself for the most part, and went out with friends, productive things I havent done in awhile. I also managed to shop for things alone without feeling anxious, despite feeling nauseated when my friend left me while he took the car to the entrance when we hung out. 

Just suddenly, now I lost track of what I want to do. I forgot how to socialize with friends or how I usually do, I forgot how I talk or the way I would respond. I dont even know how to reply to my texts. My brain feels empty.

I also feel like I'm forgetting how to do basic things, like what Im supposed to do while showering, cooking and stuff. I dont completely forget, but the things that dont require thinking just suddenly did. My mind gets really messy when I try to cross the road or pay the cashier.

I don't usually talk to my friends about these things. They try to be supportive, but I know they're uncomfortable and awkward because they don't know how to console me.

My online friends, my real life friends- all of them, idk how I just feel so detached from them. One night Im really happy and just chatting away, and today I just feel like, we're simply acquaintances. I feel awkward making jokes and I don't feel comfortable doing things I usually do anymore.

83,"I (30F) don't really know how to get it thru to her. This is a new therapist that I've started seeing. I think my issue is I've told her that my mood fluctuates alot, what I mean by that is I can be fine all day, and something or someone might set me off and once I'm raging, it's like I will say the meanest things, then I typically cool down after a few mins and then I'm apologetic for my behavior. I also feel like when I've been ""set off"", that's when all rationale goes out the window and I can't even think clearly when I'm raging. She's taking this to mean that I'm bipolar when I really doubt that I am. Another reason why I think I have BPD is my impulsive nature and instability in my relationships. I have to tendency to break up after an minor thing happens because in my head, I'm thinking that I'm going to leave this person before they leave me...but that always stirs up my abandonment issues, because after the breakup, I become really needy and I'm begging them to take me back. I also suffered from sexual abuse and physical abuse in my childhood/teen years. Have PTSD from that. Another thing is value/devalue ppl in my life, once I feel that someone has 'slighted' me, I will basically kick that person out of my life. It doesn't even have to be real, it could just be something that I might have even made up in my mind because I tend to overthink situations. With new friends/new relationships, I tend to pick up on their habits, their likes/dislikes, their slang/lingo and make it my own as well.

When I was younger I would have constant tantrums at home for a while until entering middle school.  As I went through middle school and high school I was extremely shy and shut off.  My childhood tantrums of screaming and crying later became hidden cries and mental breakdowns alone in my room.  At 16 I had my first thought of suicide when I had constant thoughts of becoming a pedophile because of a video I watched. It was of this little girl explaining how she had been raped by an older man repeatedly  and had become seriously afflicted with the cold callous out look of life that her abuser had shown to her. Not once had I ever thought of harming a child but for some reason couldn't shake this thought for months until my father found me crying and I explained to him I had thoughts I couldn't control, and that I didn't want to tell him. I went to a psychologist and spoke twice to her but couldn't get through without crying so I decided to stop and handle it on my own. I was able to get over these incessant thoughts but the same type of obsessive thought pattern came when I had my first girlfriend at 19 and couldn't get a specific sexual event she had with someone else, before being with me, out of my head. Knowing it was totally unreasonable to be upset but not being able to control my thoughts made it impossible to feel, or act normal.  As for this I was able to figure out at 16 that it was OCD but didn't know it was going to continue until I had a second episode. 

Result- My doctor diagnosed me with clinical depression and put me on my first antidepressant at age 19.

As the relationship ended I had gotten over everything but new problems were arising, I had mood shifts every so often that would just throw me into the worst depression. I would shut myself off like when I was little and not talk much to others and keep to myself, thinking self deprecating thoughts. Because of not being able to control these moods and it was beginning to become too much, I asked to see a psychiatrist.

Result-My psychiatrist had diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and had given me a combination of antidepressants and mood stabilizers at age 20.

Now at 21 I'm visiting a new psychiatrist and have already changed my medication twice (the total number of medications I've tried are about 7-8).  I'm currently taking 300mg of Gabapentin 3 times a day. This was the first time I tried just telling the doctor I think it's OCD so I could get the proper medication. Note that I had been against medication after stopping my past medications of the mood stabalizers and antidepressants because of the physical affect it was having on me (nauseous, couldn't hold down breakfast even after trying to switch the time I took the medication, throwing up, gagging throughout the day). I had always believed that I could naturally cure whatever was going on but as you see I've run back to the previous solutions as I don't know what else to do.  Being diagnosed multiple times and never having a clear answer confuses me to the point where I can't help but blame myself.

After further researching on my own I believe that I may have some type of ADD but cannot trust this as I am in no position to diagnose myself.  A lot of the things I have experienced in life has lined up with this disorder. When I was younger I had constant tantrums and would be extremely pervasive and overpowering to my siblings and parents. I was also sensitive to things like the tags on backs of shirt or underwear and would freak out if I had to wear it or would constantly be picking at it. I would get stuck on thoughts as I got older and become obsessive over them, as I've always had an obsessive personality. My moods would shift constantly over little things. As for my focus and attention, I always found myself listening to the first couple minutes of things or reading little bits of questions and then figuring it out on my own. I'm not stupid but I definitely don't operate how I'd like to.  I avoid sticking to routine and hated waking up for school everyday and would only go because I cared about what my mother said. Even now, I was able to enter college among obtaining a scholarship in high school for being number 21 in my class and took the first offer I saw which was community college. As for picking classes I didn't care and majored in programming, took a Chinese course, and some other randoms things. I dropped out after a year and a half because I couldn't bare the routine and sitting in class listening but also was obsessing over relationship problems, but nonetheless had no interest in school .  I went on a hiatus from school for a year just working and DJing on the side, which I eventually bought my own equipment but never got around to practicing enough to pursue it individually without a company's help.  I'm back in school now and have already made it difficult for myself even though my classes aren't hard. The reason is because I was an idiot and impulsively scheduled them with big gaps in between and I don't have the patience to wait an hour and sometimes end up going home early without finishing the day. I could go on and on about this like how many drugs I've tried or my experimentations with altered states of mind but I can see I've already dragged this on.  My goal in life was to become a Psychiatrist or something within the field of mental health/psychology because I was fascinated ever since I was 15/16 and would go on Yahoo answers looking for people's problems so I could give guidance and analyze their thinking patterns.  

At this point I'm just experiencing too many losses and failures to feel like I can see a future, I can't focus when I need to and as school will become more difficult in the future I fear that with all my problems I won't be able to do the finish a degree in Psychiatry let alone even get into med school since I've ruined my GPA after dropping out the first time. I feel like a time bomb that's always ticking and I hope impulsivity doesn't get the best of me. I know suicide isn't the answer and I'm strong enough not let myself get too far down that path but I cannot help but think it. If anyone could give me advice to what I'm going through whether it be analyzing what I've said or just giving reassurance would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you

TL;DR: Dealing with a number of mental health problems and can't figure what is actually the number one culprit. Whether it's just me or my mind.",28Mar2019,1
86,"Hi there,

TL;DR at bottom 

The title of my post might make it sound like my family has been involved in illegal activity, that isn’t the case but I am still being cautious after the form I signed at my first appointment. It said the usual “If you are a danger to yourself or to others they must report it, if there is a child in danger they must, etc” but she also mentioned “If there is evidence of any child abuse neglect even going back 30 years she must report it. If I believe your driving abilities are impaired I must report to your insurance. If you engaged in any illegal activity it will go in your file and if you ever are in trouble with the law your file can be subpoenaed by a judge for up to seven years.” 

Now that all made me hesitate. My parents are amazing and have done nothing wrong, but no one is perfect and that made me think of hypotheticals as to what she would have to report. If a parent had used illegal substances when there was a child at home, being taken care of by the other parent and the child was never exposed to seeing it or wasn’t affected by it. would that be something she would have to report? How minor does it go...if an older child is playing in the house and the parent falls asleep while watching them for 20 min. is that neglect/abuse? 

This is less relevant but I’m still just curious. If I were to have driven under the influence before, which I haven’t, but for the sake of the question would she then have to report it to my insurance agency? 

Im new to therapy and now I’m hesitant to share anything with my therapist regarding my family because I don’t feel like I have any privacy. One of my parents has had a rough couple of years and I have a younger sibling (adopted) that’s still at home and has never been exposed to or affected by the struggles of my one parent.  If they were to have done something like have one too many drinks at night, or smoked weed after while the child is in my other parents care....is that worthy of being reported? Again I know like it sounds like something sketchy is going on but it’s all very minor stuff and my sibling has never been left unattended/neglected/abused or been exposed to anything...but the way my therapist explained it, it honestly sounded like if I said my parents drank at night when I was younger after I went to bed (they didn’t) it would be reported. 

I might be being paranoid but I want to be able to share everything that’s gone on in the last few years with my therapist but I feel like something harmless I say could be taken the wrong way and be reported. Yet I hear all the time of people telling their therapist they were abused as a child horribly and yet their parents aren’t investigated and charged (although I wish that was how it worked in those situations!). I’m in Canada, if that matters. I am going to talk to her today about my concerns and hopefully that clears things up but I was hoping some of you might be able to weigh in to clarify some of this for me or let me know what your experience has been. 

TL;DR

My therapist had me sign the usual “if I suspect you are a danger to yourself or others, or there is a child in danger or being abused/neglected I am required to report it.” I get that,  but she went on to talk about reporting incidents at work and that if she suspected my driving ability was ever impaired/affected she has to contact my insurance provider. Finally “If a child has ever been in danger/neglected/abused even if it was 30 years ago I must report” 

My parents have always been amazing and have adopted children so were thoroughly checked out by social services and had multiple home studies done, they are good parents. But what is reportable? In the last few years my family has run into some hard times and has become a bit dysfunctional. If one parent used an illegal substance while a child was home but the child was being taken care of by the other parent and was not exposed, is that neglect/in danger. What if a parent falls asleep while watching a middle school aged child? I feel like I have no privacy speaking to her...I know it sounds like there is something seriously shady going on but there isn’t. From what she said it sounds like if I said “Once when I was 11, my parents were fighting (not violently...just arguing, maybe swearing) and forgot to make me supper” she might report that? I’m all for therapists taking measures to protect people, especially children but want to make sure there’s a difference between my example of missing supper and a child being in harms way in regards to reporting.

87,"To be fair, this is a therapist at a college, so I shouldn't be all that surprised. It doesn't make me feel much better about therapy ever helping me, though.

No thanks to that bitch, now it's up to me to try and not have a fucking breakdown going to work today because oh my god people hate me so much even my therapist wants me to go crawl in a hole somewhere and die. It's seriously never going to get better, this is just how it's always gonna be to exist as me.

92,"Instagram recently blocked many mental health related hashtags like #suicide, #cutting, and #schizophrenic. As an advocate, I question why we are blocking the language -- and therefore the discussion -- surrounding of mental illness at all. But, as a schizophrenic I'm deeply concerned that Instagram determined my illness is offensive and/or inappropriate.

I have no doubt Instagram believes they helped people like me today and I am equally sure people will claim a victory over limiting the ways that people can access information and education about mental illness. As a person who lives with schizophrenia or as a schizophrenic -- your choice -- I can tell you with absolutely certainty that this did nothing to make my life better. I will never understand why we argue this nonsense about the right language.

When can we talk more about access to healthcare?

97,"Sorry for the vague title, but that's what my question is.

I have bouts of paranoia, but I'm not sure if they're normal or more severe. I have always been at least somewhat mentally ill due to bad childhood, so I don't have anything to compare with.

Sometimes I get very strong feelings that my friends do not like me at all. So strong, that I'm very, very suspicious of them, even trying to ""find out"" if my suspicions are true by various means, like asking different questions and even almost spying on them by going around the city to see if I find them doing/saying something behind my back. Currently, I'm not at this bad phase and it sounds a bit ridiculous but yeah, that's what I've done. These bouts may last some weeks at a time. These suspicions are only towards people my age, but are sometimes so strong it's almost unbearable. I can also be very jealous sometimes.

I do, however, have some real reasons to suspect some of my ""friends"", since I've heard from trusted sources that they have spread rumors about me, and that I'm not very liked (this is a fact). I've also heard this myself. This does not help the situation, because it strenghtens the suspicions towards all of my friends. 

Another thing I've been paranoid about is the police. I have, in the past, thought that they're at least somehow interested in me, maybe even after me. Also, I've thought that any and every oncoming car might be police car, so I've been driving very carefully (a good thing though). Anytime I have to do anything that involves police (like going through a road block) I get very anxious, to the point I shake and laugh nervously. Again, not helping that I've had police knocking on my door and stopping me many times for no reason. Though I'm not always exactly a model citizen but still, never got in trouble with law.

Then there's the fact that I'm a bad person. And I mean it. Really. And that's why I'm afraid everything around me will shamble at some point. But I've chosen this way anyway. I'm not currently depressed or paranoid.",28Mar2019,1

99,"So this week has been hell for me. I have depression, anxiety and PTSD alongside a chronic physical illness. I do also have a drinking problem and am working on it with my friends while I wait for therapy (long waiting list).

This week started with me thinking that I knew what was wrong with my body and that some blood tests would confirm it. However, I found out that I have hypothyroidism alongside an unknown physical illness. I'm not upset by the hypothyroidism as it's treatable and I now get free prescriptions for life but it doesn't explain my other symptoms. I have been living with chronic pain for 4 years now and fibromyalgia was the best fit for me as I have all of the symptoms. However, due to this blood test we do not know what it is. I've been told that if it is something that will constantly deteriorate there are treatments to stop it but I don't like not knowing/ understanding why I'm in constant pain. 

Then there's this guy who is really triggering my PTSD. We ""met"" when I was blackout drunk and we made out which I didn't know about until I saw a load of hickeys on my neck the next day. Since then I have made it clear that I'm not attracted to him and just want to be friends which he accepted. He takes care of me when I'm drunk and is really kind and supportive. However, this Saturday I got blackout drunk and woke up to him in my bed. This has happened before although I was in a consenting state but it was an accident as I just wanted a cuddle (I just recently broke up with someone and am still not over him) and I fell asleep. However, this guy knew what state I was in. I had thrown up and so was safe to sleep alone but somehow he ended up staying the night. I don't think he did anything else but it's really shaken me up as it's similar to when I was raped 2 years ago. I got blackout drunk and only remember short bursts from when the pain was so bad. Now I need to figure out how to deal with him as he makes me super uncomfortable but he attends my societies events where I have to be as I'm the leader and create all the events for my members. 

I also have an essay due in this Friday and it's stressing me out as it's a simple topic that I know a lot about but I don't know how to write it. I also need to pick my final year dissertation soon but due to my health I can only focus on one thing at a time. 

Sorry for the rant but I'm just so stressed out about everything and I needed to vent. ",28Mar2019,1
100,"About 2 year ago now I went to a mental hospital. Unfortunately the place I went to was abusive, it was the first place I’d ever felt suicidal, and the staff were not qualified. They diagnosed me with schizo-affective disorder and told me “it was basically just bipolar but worse”. I have never hallucinated, I don’t have delusions, but I am very unstable. I have some past traumas that cause daily panic attacks, they said that my panic attacks were evidence of the disorder, as well as telling me all my past trauma didn’t exist and I “made them up”. Therefore that was the “delusion” I suffered. They put me on lithium and riseradone almost immediately after being admitted. Two medications that should be a LAST resort. There was no therapy there, other patients were abused, sometimes physically. They had a solitary confinement room they’d throw kids in for 5-10 hours. It was horrific. My mental state went to shambles and I could have had a psychotic break. Lithium made me suicidal, I lost a lot of my eyesight for 2 weeks, I began trembling all over, feeling week everywhere, my light sensitivity got so back I had to wear sunglasses or my eyes would swell shut. They told me “all this is normal” and refused to evaluate me.

Now even 2 years later I am still suffering with the tremors and weakness. I wasn’t on an extremely high dose, I’d have to ask how much it was, but somehow I got all these horrible reactions. At first, it got better after being off lithium. The tremors went down and my strength came back. After a year I’d lost the 20 pounds I gained from my 2-3 week visit (yes, 20 fucking pounds). They kept telling me there I was going to have diabetes, they poked at my weight constantly, I had high blood pressure once there, and never again in my life have I had it!

Recently the same weakness I felt before seems to be coming back. The tremors are the same. They’ve made it hard to pick small things up, draw, and do some other small tasks. But this weakness made it hard for me to even open a bottle. I feel like every day I’m getting worse and I don’t even know WHY. All I know is it started with lithium and I can’t find any information on it, Hell, I can’t even find information on my eyes sight loss I had while I was there.

For years I’ve been strongly against lithium after what happened to me. It’s the source of now some of my worst memories. Every time I have trouble writing because my band gets weak I just think about my experience at the hospital. I just want to know how to make it stop or know if there is really anyone else out there that has dealt with this. I feel so alone in this and it’s frustrating. I want to move on and get better in my life but my hands are making it harder to pursue that.

I’ve had recommendations to try hand braces but I don’t know where I would get one or how to find was size I’d need. I just want to know if anyone here can help or has any recommendations. Would it be worth going to a physical therapist to see what they think? The weakness in my hands is more obvious than my tremors are at this point. It’s just frustrating. I try taking breaks and not using them much for weeks, thinking maybe I overworked myself, but it’s not that. I’ve been taking a breaks for a week or two from drawing and if anything it’s getting worse. I just don’t know what to do or where to turn to.

My parents are aware but no doctor has ever acknowledged that my issue is severe enough to look into treating. And it’s not, but I just want to function without being reminded of everything that’s happened and how it’s mentally and physically damaged me you know. It’s not like I can’t use my hands, but for an artist to have trouble drawing because her hands are too shaky, I feel like that’s enough to do something about it. And the memories it bring up every time I notice the shaking and the weakness just suck. Technically my entire body is trembling constantly, but it’s my hands that I want to fix. I just want to be able to do things without feeling fucking weak. Even typing this, even after my week long break, my hands are extremely worn out to the point where even my arms are feeling sore. This isn’t right. It wasn’t always like this.",28Mar2019,1
101,"I have a track record of having a fine day, then out of nowhere someone mentions a certain topic, phrase, or word, and my body reacts before I do. One time on a conversation about parents and marriages, I cried. Another about families, I was talking normally when my friend points out that my eyes had been tearing since a few minutes before. Today, my boyfriend mentioned drinking several times resulting to a panic attack.

I don't know what this is but I'm pretty sure it has something to do with my mental health. I needed to talk about it because I don't understand it, can't afford a therapist, can't find anything about it, and wanted to find out if anybody else had gone through something similar.",28Mar2019,1
102,"Another try. I made a similar post recently but it got so out of context and was so badly written I had to delete it, I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

I have some bouts of paranoia, but I'm not sure if it's normal or not. I've always been more or less mentally ill so I don't have anything to compare to.

I have severe distrust towards my friends sometimes. To the point where I try to find out if they are planning stuff/talking shit about me behind my back. I ask questions and even almost spy on them by going around town and look if I can find them doing stuff behind my back. Ridiculous, I know, but when I'm having these bouts of paranoia I find doing so completely rational and right. These bouts usually last a couple weeks. I've had some friends betray me in the past though. 

Another thing is fear of police. I've had times when I think every car might be police car. I've also thought that police is after me, to the point where I was always cautious. I always get very nervous when the police is nearby, and anytime I have anything to do with them I get very shaky.

I used to have severe fear of dogs after loose dog attacked me (not afraid anymore). I also get panic attacs when at or near a school (I was heavily bullied). I don't trust any people of my age, except my friends sometimes. I always have this idea in my head that I'm not and can not be liked. Sometimes I ""go inside my shell"" being just alone and not talking to anyone. If someone disturbs me then I get very annoyed. I've had diagnosed severe depression, but I've been better for two years now, on medication though. Some of these paranoid thoughts still occasionally arise. Is this just normal and I'm worried for nothing?",28Mar2019,3
103,"OK, so this might be really long and twisted. I don't even know how many issues there really are, but I need to get this off my chest and also seek direction on how to deal with it. I really hope you go through the entire post. I'll try to keeping things clear and simple, but given how complex the situation (or maybe my mind) is, it might get a little twisted and lengthy. Please Please bear with me.

So here's the situation

My family includes 4 members - Dad, Mom, Sibling and Me.
There's also my girlfriend, who's an important member of my circle and this post,

We've not been doing so great financially for ever, and the past has not been so good socially, economically and hence emotionally. We still aren't doing so great, but I really aimed at changing that now that I started working.

**1.Mom:** She's recently had a surgery and doesn't keep too well. There are multiple health issues that have led her to be mostly indoors. This sometimes gets to her and she isn't that happy. Basically her physical and mental health is not at it's best

**2. Dad:** He too has a medical condition, I do not want to post specific details as many of my friends are here on reddit and would figure out who I am. He needs to keep really good care of himself, his diet and his exertion else things could get extremely complicated

**3. My sibling** is elder and a person with special needs. She had an accident as a child that damaged her brain. It's developed over time and she has all her motor skills. However cognitively and behaviorally she isn't normal. It's a mix where she might understand something complex like cooking, but not how to prioritize. Doesn't like being corrected and often gets violent if things don't go her way. The violence can be directed to any one, even my parents who aren't at the best of their health any ways. Given she cooks and does things the way she prefers, they are not able to follow the diet they are supposed to. Correcting her leads to more violence making things equally bad. Trying to cook by ourselves also leads to the same reaction.

**4. And then there's me.** I have a lot to write about myself (obviously), and this is where things get a little uncertain (I feel like I can no longer comprehend my own feelings, thoughts and behaviour). I've not had a great past. My childhood was spent in a locality where I was a minority religiously and was often not included to play with other kids. College was comparatively awesome and I made a lot of friends. I've dealt with 3 break ups since and now am in the 4th. I never felt I had mental health issues, infact on the contrary I remember having a very clear and calm mind even when things didn't go great. I even helped other friends with their emotional issues. The only issue I recollect was possessiveness. I've felt it for my girlfriends and even for some friends I consider close. It often felt like I was over-possessive. I only two things that made me normal again was

**The first is**
a) Answers to doubtful questions that haunted the head: For example, ""was she talking to him ( a close male friend)"" if I saw her online and not responding to me. I found this behavior irrational cause
a.She could be doing a lot of things instead of just chatting with that guy
b.Even if she is, it should not be a big deal. I do have a lot of female friends and chat with them, doesn't change how I feel about her
c.It in no way means she does not love you or is cheating on you. 

In-spite of all this, it would still bother me. I never felt the fear that she'd leave me for someone else. Instead the fear revolved more about her organically preferring someone else's company over mind. Maybe in a platonic nature, but someone else ending up more important than me. (I basically don't like sharing my space in terms of importance)

**The second thing to calm me was**
b) Assurance from her in the form of a gesture that proved I was as important as I always was. I know this behavior is weird, I found it irrational myself, but was never able to get to the root of how I felt this way.

Things were not the same with my current girl, she’s been very sweet and caring. I felt completely assured with her. However, things changed when I recently went for a trip with her and her friends. Seeing her enjoy their company fool around with them etc kinda triggered me again. She had once shared how they hit each other playfully etc and I had then told her it would make me feel a little uncomfortable if that happened now. She said she understood and would not do it if it bothers her. However, it happened for a small amount of time on the trip and that triggered me a bit. My over possessiveness has since, come back and I find myself irrationally analyzing things and constantly living with the feeling of being unimportant. 

To add to this, since then, things have only gone downhill. Not just in terms of the relationship, but also other areas of life. These incidents are completely unrelated to the incident I mentioned above, and are just parts of a series of unfortunate events. I do not want to get into too many details as again, I have friends here, and I want this to remain anonymous. But to name a few, I got scammed for a lot of money, had a miscalculated bill where I had to pay off an exorbitant amount of cash in spite of it not being my fault and a few more similar incidents. 
I’ve basically been on my toes for the past few months. After all this, I feel extremely disconnected from everything.

As of now, I feel the following things

**1. Over-possessive:** As mentioned about, the behavior is back. I want to stop this cause deep down I know she’s a really sweet girl and actually accommodates this behavior of mind. It’s completely unfair and I really want to make things right. I might post a detailed post on /relationships. Will update the link here if I do.
**2. Paranoia:** Given things have gone horribly wrong in the recent past, I feel like taking as much precaution as I can on everything else. From locks, to safes to passwords and covers, I have been fretting over it all
**3. Short temper:** I have become extremely irritable, intolerant and angry. I sometimes don’t even know what exactly has made me angry. But even the tiniest of thing makes me lost my temper uncontrollably. I’ve started to react to my sibling’s violence with my own and this has really alarmed me. 
**4. Disconnected:** I feel like I have died on the inside. Nothing drives me anymore. I don’t look forward to anything and am excited about nothing. I’m not suicidal only because I love a few people who would face a lot of trouble in my absence. However, for myself, there’s absolutely nothing I’d want to wake up for tomorrow. 

I want to do the following

1. Sort myself out
2. Be able to sort my sibling before things get worse

Help of either or both would be much appreciated

p.s. The paranoia (probably) has led me to have trust issues in general and hence with regards to privacy in terms of seeking help from a professional as well. However, at such a time I don’t know what else to do. 

TL:DR: There are multiple issues occurring together. Possessiveness, Paranoia, Short Tempered Behavior and a feeling of disinterest. This is coupled with a sibling with special needs who I need to handle. How does one handle both situations simultaneously.",28Mar2019,1

106,"I'm female, 28, live in USA. I'm clinically depressed, am a candidate for Borderline Personality Disorder, high functioning autistic, and I have massive childhood trauma I can't get over.

I'll try to keep these things short. TL:DR I'm a mess and I want to destroy my happiness because I feel my happiness is my husband's misery.

I feel like my mom's never loved me. This may sound petty, but I think a large portion of it is that I'm the oldest and a girl. Just like her older sister that she hates and my dad's older sister that she hates. My mom also has her mental illnesses, but she refuses to acknowledge them. It's everyone else's fault. So yeah, it's safe to say she is that petty. 

Her current husband hates me as well. I was 14 when he and my mom got married, and he never tried to have a relationship with me. I'm honestly ok with it, though, as I'm not too fond of him either. But he and my mom were my biggest bullies in high school. Due to the autism, I'm slow in some aspects of life, especially social, and I've struggled to understand sarcasm. They would constantly tell me I'm stupid and I'm a loser and I'll never make it anywhere in life. So it's kinda stuck.

My dad, on the other hand, has been less of a black and white relationship. He has his issues as well, and he used to take them out on me. He's been doing better in the last few years (his brother killed himself 2.5 years ago, and it was really a wake up call for him), but I still feel like I have to walk on eggshells. I know a lot of his stuff is that he projects his failures onto me, but even in knowing that, it doesn't help having a 3rd parent I'm stupid, I'm a loser, I'll never make it anywhere.

For most of my adult life, I dated losers because that's all I thought I'd ever deserve. Then, miraculously, I met the man who's now my husband. He doesn't hit me, he doesn't cheat on me, he doesn't belittle me. He's the exact opposite of what I'm used to. And his family is the same, they welcomed me with open arms, they didn't care about my past, just who I am now. His mom even helped me get my real estate license. His parents basically paid for the wedding as well (not hugely expensive, and they were both thrilled).

But there's the problem. I don't deserve these nice things. I haven't been successful in real estate yet, so I've been having to work retail to keep bills paid, which then means less time to work on real estate. I know I'm smart enough to do something else, but I barely graduated high school, I don't have experience in anything but retail or fast food, no other learning either, and I'm really not ambitious.  So on paper I look stupid and it's hard to find anything other than cashiering. I feel like I've been a failure to my husband and I'm mooching off him and his family. I'm dreading the day they all wake up and realise that I'm not good enough for them. 

I just don't feel good enough to deserve good things. I love my husband and I want to be better so I can stay with him, but at the same time I want to run away so he can find someone he really deserves.

If you made it this far, thank you. You have no idea how much you mean to me taking this much time to read all that shit.",28Mar2019,1
107,"I'm not entirely sure how to go about explaining what my family is currently going through. I'll try to be as sensitive as I know how to be.

My father is undiagnosed and refuses to believe there may be anything wrong with him, but he's exhibited very worrying symptoms throughout the years. My assumption is that he's on the bipolar spectrum, but obviously I can't say for sure. I'm not looking to diagnose him, as you can't over the internet. I'm just hoping for some understanding or advice on how to deal.

Things have been bad in the past before now, mostly during my mid and late teens, but a lot of it is a bit of a blur. I know my dad had several traumatic things happen to him in a relatively short amount of time (cancer, death of his mother, troubles in his marriage to my mom), and that he had what seemed like a total mental breakdown. This would have been while he was in his...late 30s, early 40s. It didn't seem out of the question that he WOULD have a mental breakdown after all of this, but it's continued on to the present, about 16 years later.

I can no longer put his symptoms in any kind of chronological order because, like I said, it's largely a blur. I believe his psychotic episode came first--strange, paranoid behavior that resulted in him eventually calling the police on my mother for something that was horrific and untrue (I was present during all of this), and him being hospitalized for a few days after. I can't remember what happened when he came home. I can't remember when they started in earnest, but I do remember there were hallucinations--he would get angry at my mom for whispering at him when she wasn't, would accuse my grandpa of it too (his father). There was a period of him seeming incredibly distant, a ""lights on but no one's home"" kind of thing. There was a period where he and my mother went out partying hard almost every weekend, very out of character for my dad especially, who is normally a homebody and pretty judgmental of a partying lifestyle. There was a period that seemed to last the longest where he seemed incredibly depressed, would barely talk, acted strangely.

And then one day, or maybe over a week or so...it went away. All of it. He seemed himself again. For a long time he seemed himself again. There would be short bouts of him seeming too hyper, reminiscent of the period where he'd party all the time. There were bouts of depression. There were bouts where he'd start accusing my mom of whispering at him again, but none of it was anything like that first horrible horrible period of time.

Of course, all of this--even the periods that aren't as bad as that first time--is very hard on my mother, and this latest bout of what feels like what I've read about mania sent her over the edge. It started in late October, possibly early November, seemed to worsen after the death of his grandmother in January, and is still ongoing. My dad starts to get very talkative in these states, has less of a filter, shares uncomfortable humor, wants to tell long, rambling stories, can be mean and verbally aggressive with my mom when no one is around, blows money like it's water, exhibited very strange behavior at a few family Christmas parties. He started to pick fights with her every morning before she left for work and that put her over. She begged him to go to the doctor and left for the first time in their 29 years of marriage and came to stay at my house.

For about ten days he was alone. He cleaned their house from top to bottom, bought a ton of new housewares items, and then left without a word. We found out he'd left the state from a post he made on Facebook. He went clear across the country, stopping along the way to party and post on Facebook about it (very ooc behavior, he NEVER uses Facebook and is normally a very private person). He was gone for about two weeks or so, my mom went home to their house to be there when he came back and when he finally showed up his symptoms didn't seem improved at all. He kept doing the same things as before, accusations of whispering, picking fights, not sleeping in their bed, and then my mom found out about a hookup with her sister's friend that he was attempting and everything took a very sharp turn into the full blown hell that we're all currently living in.

As soon as he knew that my mom knew about the attempted hookup he suddenly decided he couldn't be in the house with her because she might try to do something violent to him and that he wants a divorce. He has refused to be in the same room with my mother for over two months now. Won't talk to her face to face. Makes awful facebook posts about her for our whole family to see. He's constructed this elaborate delusion in his mind about my mom's family having it out for him, about my mom's sister and her husband trying to get my dad to sleep with this girl years ago and my mom knowing about it, he keeps telling me and my siblings this story and forgetting that he's told us. He's living with his father and is starting to get mean with him now too. It's hard to even fully express all of the incredible hurt he's caused to my mom's family in strange group texts he's been sending. It's been around 5 months since all of this started.

I love my dad dearly. When he's himself he's a great father, but it's so difficult to be around him right now. I've virtually cut off all communication with him. He texts my siblings and I that he loves us, but ignores it or tells us we don't understand when we tell him all of his actions are tearing us apart. He truly seems to believe he's the victim of some grand conspiracy. As I was typing this up he was sending texts to my sister and I, laying out this truly out-there story once again.

It hard to imagine what my relationship with him will look like on the other side of this. I'm desperate for any ideas on what to do, how to cope, or even to hear some similar experiences.

109,"Hey all. I hope someone can help me here - I didn't want to ask this question in a  public space.

Is there a disorder or syndrome or diagnosis for someone who tends to unintentionally take-on other people's symptoms? I have a friend who in the past has admitted to doing this while talking to their psychiatrist - and I'm concerned that part of the reason they've been struggling so much recently is that they are getting misdiagnosed and not treated correctly

I've found stuff about ""Factitious disorder imposed on self"" and hypochondriasis but these don't seem to fit because they seem to imply there's an intentional part of it - rather than a subconscious recognizing symptoms in oneself, and then convincing oneself they have the same ailment.

So for example:

* Convincing oneself they have a peanut allergy and epilepsy while dating a person with both.
* Diagnosing oneself as bi-polar after befriending and talking to a person with bi-polar.
* Diagnosing oneself as being on the autistic spectrum after spending time with their brother who is autistic.
* Diagnosing oneself as have BPD after two months of dating a person with it and reading literature about it - initially with the intent to understand their partner better.

This person has a recurring habit of this - when they spend time with people with a chronic ailment  - and/or research it - they being exhibiting symptoms of that ailment and convince themselves they have it - quite aggressively to the point they have left psychologists and psychiatrists who refused to agree with their diagnosis and have gotten into arguments with friends who suggest that they did not exhibit any of these symptoms a month ago.

I don't think it's intentional - they did confess that the peanut allergy/epilepsy thing they came to realize was a delusion. I think they genuinely believe their self-diagnosis are true. SO far all the stuff I've looked for about this implies it comes from a conscious desire to be looked after, see doctors, be placed in hospital, elicit sympathy or be the center of attention - etc. None of that seem like it would motivate this person - they genuinely dislike going to hospital or doctors and usually can't afford the medication or consultations with psychiatrists and psychologists.

If anyone knows what might be going on, I'd love to hear it. I apologize if any of this comes across incorrectly - I tried to use the most up to date terminology for all these things but I may have messed up.

I have a, at times aberrant, fear of losing those close to me. A dream will come to me at night that my pup (“Dude”) will be dying right in my arms, or that my parents somehow passed away without warning. I’ll wake up in a hysteric panic, sweating and sometimes crying at the thought of losing them. Morbid as hell, right? Recently, I did a little deep dive into what this is, and came up with “Thanatophobia.” Now, I don’t think I’m ready to diagnose myself here. That said, I think this is an issue that many people struggle with, and something I thought could create a conversation around. At the very least, let someone know they aren’t alone. In this post, I want to look at ways to cope with this fear of losing those closest to you. 

**Live in the moment**

This is something that I repeat to myself on a daily basis. Being *present* is important no matter what’s going on in a person’s life. It allows you to truly live for the moment, and without the cloudiness of thoughts that probably don’t pertain to what you’re doing at that moment. To live life to the fullest. “SHEEESH! Does this guy ever stop with the therapist mumbo jumbo?” Relax there Cujo. Maybe you should try it. I date a therapist. Blame her. (jk jk Love you, babe)

If you suddenly are triggered with anxiety regarding the fear of losing someone, set up some time to hangout with them. Enjoy the time you have with them. Live in the moment. Those are the times you’ll look back on and smile at. Don’t hold onto that fear. Hold onto the time you have with this person, or pup. It’ll make a world of difference. 

**Death is inevitable; let go of controlling everything**

The sooner a person can grasp this fact in life then the better off their quality of life will be. We all will face the cold hard truth that we won’t be on this earth forever. That’s ok! As long as you're making the most of your time, you will always live without regret. Well, at least to some degree. 

Truth is, I’m kind of a control freak. I’ve definitely learned to let go in many aspects of my life, but much of that controlling nature still resides in me. The idea is to accept the things you have no control over, the courage to change the things you can, and the wisdom to know the difference. Before you go trying to say “YOU DIDN’T MAKE THAT UP!”, I know I didn’t, bonehead. It’s called the “serenity prayer.” Look it up when you need a wake up call in respect to your control issues. 

**Know that this feeling is NORMAL**

It’s human nature to be scared of losing those that mean the most to you. I’d be a little skeptical of someone that was ok with losing the puppy they raised. That said, know that when you have these anxious feelings, it means that you love and care about whoever you’re having these thoughts about. Just don’t let them control you or the relationship you have with the opposite side. Make sure you enjoy the f\*ck out of the time you have with this person. Live in the moment, and let go of the control burden you may carry. These feelings you’re having are normal.

I’ve experienced loss in my life. I’m happy to say I still have my core group of people that mean the most to me. I love them unconditionally, and enjoy every single moment I have with them. The fear of losing my puppy, girlfriend, or parents still creep into my mind from time to time. I’ve found that when this happens, I reach out to them. I give them a kiss, or a pet on the belly. I completely let go of the fact that they will inevitably leave me one day, and live in the moments that I have with them. It’s granted me serenity in my life, and it’ll do the same for you. 

Love will always prevail. Alright, that was cheesy. ",28Mar2019,1

And I can't take medical marijuana either. Those anxiety ""tricks"" don't fucking work. Breathing techniques, exercise, yoga, meditation, none of that works. How am I supposed to get better? Will I ever get any better? What the fuck should I do? I'm struggling to find reasons to live. Could use some advice.",28Mar2019,2
112,"When I was 15 I was dating this guy who forced me to sleep with him because he'd tell me that no one else would ever love me and that he'd kill himself if I didn't fuck him. This continued for a year (we banged 6-7 times I think) and then he ghosted me for two months before breaking up with me over text. 

It's been almost 3 years since we broke up and I have since moved on. I just started going to a therapist who thinks I may have PTSD but I am not officially diagnosed. Last month I started dating a guy who I love more than anything. We tried to have sex near the beginning of our relationship but I had a panic attack and complete mental breakdown. we didn't try again until Monday night and I was able to not only have sex with him but also orgasm. It's been such a long struggle but now  I think I've met my soulmate and I don't know if I can be happier.  :)

113,"First of all, thank you for still being here. I want you to know that I know how you are feeling, my friend. Welcome to this post and feel free to tell your tips:) 

**1) Reach out and stay connected**
     It's hard to take action when you are depressed, but promise to yourself that when you are feeling better (at least not feeling that down) you will talk about it with someone you feel safe with. **What if I don't trust people anymore? I don't want to talk to someone!** That's fine, there is another possibility for you with the same benefits- talk to yourself, talk out *loud*. There is a huge difference when your inner voice is talking and when you are saying your thoughts out loud. **This is silly, another option please?** Sure, keep a journal, write down your thoughts. **I don't want to write them, what if someone will find them?** If that's what you think, keep it hiden, but there is NO SHAME to feel down, if you don't want to keep it, burn it.

You can also reach help as an ANONYM. There is help for you EVERYWHERE. 

**There are apps for talking about your feelings, free.: 7Cups and TalkLife are my favs! Both on both platforms Appstore and Play Store:)**



2) **Find ways to support others**. It’s nice to receive support, but research shows you get an even bigger mood boost from providing support yourself. So find ways—both big and small—to help others: volunteer, be a listening ear for a friend, do something nice for somebody.

3) **Care for a pet** While nothing can replace the human connection, pets can bring joy and companionship into your life and help you feel less isolated. Caring for a pet can also get you outside of yourself and give you a sense of being needed—both powerful antidotes to depression.




4) **Do things you enjoy (or used to)**

While you can’t force yourself to have fun or experience pleasure, you can push yourself to do things, even when you don’t feel like it. You might be surprised at how much better you feel once you’re out in the world. Even if your depression doesn’t lift immediately, you’ll gradually feel more upbeat and energetic as you make time for fun activities.

Pick up a former hobby or a sport you used to like. Express yourself creatively through music, art, or writing. Go out with friends. Take a day trip to a museum, the mountains, or the ballpark.


**Support your health**

**Aim for eight hours of sleep** . Depression typically involves sleep problems; whether you’re sleeping too little or too much, your mood suffers. Get on a better sleep schedule by learning healthy sleep habits.

**Keep stress in check**. Not only does stress prolong and worsen depression, but it can also trigger it. Figure out all the things in your life that stress you out, such as work overload, money problems, or unsupportive relationships, and find ways to relieve the pressure and regain control. There is an app for this called **Youper**

Practice relaxation techniques. A daily relaxation practice can help relieve symptoms of depression, reduce stress, and boost feelings of joy and well-being. Try yoga, deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation.

114,"I have posted about this before but I have been thinking about it for a while. 

After waiting about 8 weeks to get into a psychiatrist I finally had an appointment. She only gave me a diagnosis of general anxiety. She threw out I might have cyclothymia but she didnt want to officially diagnose me for some reason. Mentioned it could just be my hormones since I had a kid (2 1/2 years ago). She disregarded that I have had this problem since I was in my late teens or early 20s. 

She did give me a script for Lamicital but I quickly found out I'm allergic to it (swollen throat, mouth ulcers) so that's a no go. So I called to see her again, she wont be in for the date of our next appointment in a month (had to take the day off work for that) and now her next opening isnt for 6 weeks. Doesnt help she only works from 9-4 on fridays. 

So I'm done!! No longer will I try to see this woman. I'm still going to see my therapist but I'm not sure how to get help now. There arent alot of doctors near me and being a mom with a full time job its makes my time limited. Has anyone had success with primary's prescribing meds or do you always need to see a psychiatrist?

It got to the point where I was telling “whoever” was controlling my life to give me a sign and STRANGELY enough after asking for a sign I crawled into bed and I heard a VERY loud knocking on the front door.

I'm well in my mid 20s and there's absolutely no chance in the world I'd let anyone close, ever, but apparently most people have no issues with it. I see that it's not because of my diagnoses because other people with depression, anxiety, gender dysphoria, even AvPD have some kind of relationships, or at worst have trouble with finding a partner or just the sexual part. But for me even if some family member tries to hug me I immediately push back. I'm not too worried about it, because it's my free choice to live without intimacy, but I hope I won't ever need urgent medical care because I'm not going to risk getting a catheter or some invasive tests. My physical pain tolerance is very high when it comes to avoiding such things. I know it sounds a little silly to think about suicide because of minor things, but sometimes I read reddit posts about the things that someone experienced, and I think, wow, I'd be dead at this point. Like, literally dead, to avoid this situation. Life is bad enough as it is I'd think. It sounds like overreacting, but I have no idea how other people can stay so calm.

Maybe I really am a selfish, lazy person. I always thought I was selfless. As a child I had to take care of my mother. As an adult I dedicated my time to helping animals. But maybe I just use those things to make me feel like a good person? I don't know. All I know is I'm tired. I'm spiraling and I'm just done trying. This doesn't really have much of a point. Just wondering if anyone else has felt low like this..",28Mar2019,2
123,"I own a roofing company, and we are starting to get calls for estimates. I’ve also been going to doctor appointments and babysitting and puppy sitting and I’ve also had teenagers stopping by everyday after school (I am a central hub for those kiddos who have no moms or less than acceptable home lives. They call me mom even though I’m only 12-15 years older than them.) as well as friends non stop for 4 days. I was diagnosed BPD last week and I also have OCD as well as anxiety. 

When things get hectic like this, I need to step away because I get SOOOOOO overwhelmed. My husband and I came home yesterday after meeting with clients and grocery shopping in the next town over, and I told him that I needed to lie down and just get away for a minute. He was okay with it, but because I spent the last year in bed (dad died suddenly, did not handle it well), me laying down in the middle of the day really irks him. (Understandably so). So I had four kids in my house, and they were soooooo loud, I started getting frustrated, then they kept opening my bedroom door and “MOMMY?!? Auntie Chaotic? MOOOOOOOOM!!!!” I finally snapped at them to leave me the FUCK ALONE! They stopped, but then friends came to pick up kids. The first one was fine, the second one LOUDLY yelled at his kid to put his coat and boots on... put his coat and boots on... put his coat and boots on... PUT HIS COATS AND BOOTS ON!!! About 12 times within 15 minutes. I waited til he left to come out. I was so irritated. I just needed some peace... then our other friends showed up to talk about the drama that happened this weekend with them and how badly it’s affected them... and it just grated on me. I should have been more empathetic, but all I could think was “GTFO of my house...” 

After they left, I literally lost my shit. I started talking about how I felt and what was going through my mind and before I knew it I was doing the cuntish rage, saying things I didn’t mean, not being able to calm myself down, but I was doing it in a normal voice... then I started crying because I felt bad for being mad, and then I got mad for crying about being mad, then my anxiety kicked in and I kept telling my husband that he should leave me because I’m such a psycho and an awful mother and wife, and then crying again when he would tell me I wasn’t and then being mad because he wasn’t taking me seriously, and then crying because he loves me enough to try to help me through this... then laughing at how unstable I am to finally calming down... and these tears and anger was just super extreme. Like, if I hadn’t somewhat controlled myself, I would have been hyperventilating while simultaneously smashing shit. 

This whole meltdown could have been avoided if I’d just been able to get some peace and quiet alone time. I just needed to recenter myself because I had spread myself so thin. Living with mental illness is not fun. It’s not cutesy like the shit you see on TV. It’s not as easy to just “try harder” as my husband told me last night... I replied to him that he just needed to be able to try harder to make insulin, or not have cancer blah blah blah. I’m medicated, I take vitamin D and iron, and I’m still swinging my death pendulums like this when I get overwhelmed. The point of this post, if you have someone that tells you they just need a minute, and they shut themselves away from the world, let them be shut away. Keep kids, friends, distractions, WHATEVER out of their space for the time they need. Checking on them is okay, but if they want to be left alone, LEAVE THEM ALONE. People like me NEED this in order to keep themselves sane. It’s not fun to feel completely out of control emotionally. They don’t like it anymore than you like being around it or witnessing it. It’s generally not something they really have control of, and I can tell you, they’re fucking sick and tired of being angry or sad and not having a fucking CLUE has to why... ",28Mar2019,12
124,"I've recently been prescribed quetiapine 100mg to take before bed for depression. I told the doc some nights I under sleep so he said this will help me sleep, but I think he misunderstood because I over sleep much more and I'm always tired.

125,"TL;DR: Lady with drama keeps signing up for expensive service and then never pays or follows through. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whole Story:

I'm a dog trainer and I run a board-and-train program where the dogs stay with us for a period of time. I was contacted by a woman about 4 years ago with two Irish wolfhound puppies. She went into some back story about being a single mom with two kids, one special needs. She went through the whole enrollment process over the phone and email (which is typical), made her appointments, etc. But then never paid her online invoice and I never heard back from her. No biggie, this happens enough that I don't think much of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Three years later she contacted me again like it was the first time. Her Irish wolfhounds were now 3 years old. Same detail about being a busy single mom with two kids, a girl and a disabled boy. I assumed she had forgotten we spoke previously and proceeded like it was our first contact. Same result - no payment and no response to my inquiries once all was supposedly settled.

&amp;#x200B;

Now a year later she's contacted me again, this time with two labradoodle puppies. I was already thinking she may be crazy, so this time I was very suspicious. This time I brought up the fact that we had spoken a couple times before about her Irish wolfhounds. She told me how they were just too much for her and now she has these two labradoodles but the're really rescues, she's only keeping one of them, and she's willing to pay for the training for the other one. She made mention of being a busy single mom again, but this time only mentioned one kid, her daughter, no disabled son. My heart went out to her, thinking maybe the disabled one died (if he ever existed). But she still had that same weird vibe, eager to tell me her sob story, martying herself. It's a trait that turns me off, but I am patient since I figure most people don't know they do it. But even though I felt sad for her, this time I didn't count on her. I only held her spots for a day before I left a voicemail and email saying I would need to release her spots if payment wasn't received by said deadline. No response. A day later she emailed me saying she's sorry but her close friend just died and she has to reschedule the vacation she was going to take while the dogs were here.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point we have had nearly 50 emails and around 10 phone calls over 4 years. She always has some crazy life circumstances. She's rather intense. The next time she contacts me (in 1 or 3 years, lol), I will tell her that I can't work with her. Honestly I think she's full of crap. Is this a disorder? Does it have a name? Thank you!",28Mar2019,1
126,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. They say self awareness is the first step to beating these things and I've been feeling pretty shit for a loooong ass time now and want to get over it.

I'm (21M) at uni at the moment, under a lot of pressure to do well from family and friends and also I feel a relationship standpoint. My brother and sister both graduated with a first and being the youngest I've always had to meet or do better than them. So far all my life I've managed to do better than them in pretty much everything but I don't know now, I'm doing a bloody hard degree filled with complex maths and mechanics and engineering and I only got a low B at GCSE (English curriculum). So that's that part, onto the next.

I'm pretty lazy, I tend to put in the bare minimum to get by in what I do, I don't like what I do (advice from me, don't follow your hobby as your career - you'll get sick of it and cease to get joy out of the prospect of the future) and regret doing it. I had a job as a waiter a while back because I had too, my brother worked there and so I had to work there, my sister ofcourse didn't need to as she was a girl. I hated it, the boss was an absolute prick and a pervert but I couldn't leave because there was nothing else to do in my town (which was Frickin tiny). Other than the work part I don't have motivation to do *anything*. I stay in bed until my legs hurt and often go without eating. I have no desire to eat and usually go without meals. I don't weigh a lot (5'11"" and 8st 1lb, or ~51kg). I'm not fit at all, I can barely run 10m before running out of energy. I have no desire or want to do anything. Most of my meals are things I can make in 2 minutes, but I don't have any money (being a student) to spend on take out and ready meals so today I've had 2 bowls of microwave porridge... And that's it. I don't want to go outside, I don't really have any friends. I work when I need to to meet deadlines. My day is usually thus: wake up 10-1, stay in bed til 4, at some point remember to eat and drink. Watch YouTube videos as they're the only things that interest me these days, get out of bed because my legs ache, sit at computer and play games to take my attention away from life. 

I have a girlfriend and I love her so so much, but I have so much work to do (I recently had an 85 page report to do + 2 assignments a week) that I can't afford to see her as she's from back home. Well be together 5 years this year. Anyway, this is all well and great but for a long time my dream was to travel the world and live somewhere else for several years before coming back to the UK but my girlfriend wants me to get a job in the UK so we can live together. The worst part is it is 100x easier to get a job abroad, and the pay is 100x better abroad but the catch is it's very remote work and I wouldn't be able to talk to her and that scares her. 

God this is getting long, sorry everyone if you've got this far I'm just not enjoying life at the moment. To sum up:

Tl;Dr I don't enjoy life; I have a complete lack of motivation; I'm not at all fit; I dislike uni (although thankfully I graduate this year); I'd rather stay in bed than eat or drink; I don't have any friends.

There's more to put that I can't think of at the moment but that's the general gist. ",28Mar2019,1
127,"This is a throwaway account btw. 

This is kind of a long post. And just a disclosure, I am a dumbass when it comes to mental health and psychology and treatments and ways to cope  so sorry if I just seem ignorant. I'm willing to listen and learn! 

I'm not sure if this is the right place to come for this so sorry if I waste anyone's time. I recently went in to my university counseling service for an initial consultation. I've been slacking in school, procrastinating assignments, not paying attention in class or taking good notes, feeling empty and unmotivated, and just a whole plethora of things that is resulting in poor acedemic performance. I've always kind of had these problems but in the past I've been able to power through it (and I honestly thought this was normal, but apparently not lol) but as my classes have been getting exceedingly difficult it's starting to show in my GPA. 

I had to wait nearly an hour for a counselor to call my name, which is fine and everything, but there were several people who came in long after me and someone saw them within 10 minutes of finishing their initial consultation paper work (I know they were there for that because I overheard them at the front desk and it was a small room) and I was still waiting. I'm sure there was a good reason but it still kind of bugged me. 

When a counselor finally called my name they didn't seem very friendly. I was kind of slav squatting while doing a puzzle that was provided so I figured they just might have been weirded out by me squatting or something because I know that's an unusual way to sit (the waiting room never got full, it was usually just me and 1 or 2 other people). Anyway, in their office they said some things that just made me uncomfortable and their whole tone and mannerisms made me feel like they were judging me. I dont think ""judge"" is the right word exactly but that's all I can come up with atm. 

They asked me what i do to relieve stress. I was honest despite being hesitant. I told them i enjoy memes to take my mind off of things and i also enjoy coffee if I'm feeling anxious or down. They kind of laughed and said ""that's not really a stress reliever"". I'm not familiar with coping mechanisms or how to process stress so I'm not saying they were wrong, but I also didn't really care for exactly how they reacted. They also pointed out that I had checked A LOT of boxes on the form. They said it like they just couldn't keep up with how much I had checked. Like they couldn't believe I had so much wrong with me. I didn't think I had done anything unusual. I'm stressed out, maybe depressed, I was sexually assaulted a few years ago, I'm not doing well in school... like I felt like all of that was relevant. And at least half of the psychological questions were on a scale from 0-4 so it wasn't like I'd just answered yes to every health issue on the form.  I was just trying to be honest and check everything that applied to me at the time and they made me feel like I was being a burden on them and was wasting their time. 

They pointed out that my university had sort of a self-success type of service where professionals will help you do tasks on time and help you organize. I have been here for 3 years and I hadn't heard of this specific service and the counselor was just flabberghasted that I have been there for so long and never heard of it as if it was my fault, like i wasn't trying or something. I've never seen ads for it, never seen emails about it, professors never mentioned it, my friends have never mentioned it. 

Idk, their whole tone just seemed annoyed and judgemental. But I also tend to be overly sensitive and insecure so I'm afraid I'm just taking it too personally. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the service they provided and thanked them for their time, but I just couldn't help but feeling like they really really didn't want to deal with me. 

Again, apologies for making this so long and rambling. But thank you for reading. 

EDIT: I think I should also add, when someone makes me uncomfortable like this I have a tendency to be more dishonest, and not disclose information they should probably have. If they don't have the proper information, they cannot make recommendations for me or refer me to the proper place.

128,"So I've suffered with anxiety for years, its been fine, ive learnt to cope pretty well with help from my doctors, medication and my psychotherapist.over the last could of months something inside me just changed and to start with I though it was just my anxiety getting worst, but when reaching out to other people they told me what is was experiencing was derealization. now I have heard that people experience waves of derealization that last maybe an hour or so, but I swear down I have been like this for at least two months permanently. I am convinced that I have psychosis and/or schizophrenia, but I have already gotten so much support from my doctors, that I feel like if I go to talk to them about it they are going to think I'm crazy or im just exaggerating. I know that I need help but I don't know what to do. I have heard so much about people having to be forced into hospital against their will and I don't want that to happen to me, which is why im so scared about going to get help. 

I couldn't work out what was wrong with me so last month I decided when I smoked weed that I would have more than normal and sit at my desk and try to write down what's going on in my head without my brain stopping me. when I read it the next morning, some of the things were really fucking weird:

* 'I love to interact with other people even if my body and mind sometimes collide and don’t allow me to'
* 'I want to be back on earth again'
* 'Im too stuck inside my head all the time that I don’t think I ever consider doing anything'
* 'Its as is im trapped in a prison that I created myself'
* 'Im constantly just so intertwined with my own thoughts, there are so many people inside my head and each of the wants something different'
* 'I wish I could be free and interact with other people but there are things in my head and they won't let me and im trapper'
* 'I want to be a much more laid back person but I don’t know how to let go of my other personalities'
* 'I know I can make the right decisions and I continuously confine myself with counter thoughts but I need to be my own open self and allow myself for think freely'

129,"Hey,

I just need to vent. I do hope someone will take the time to read and perhaps comfort me. This is going to be a bit long, I'm sorry.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel alienated. I feel dehumanised, like a stranger to myself. I feel like I've forgotten who I am. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just moved out of the country to study overseas. In fact, I plan on staying here since it's a better place to live. I grew up alone, with my parents and my sibling. We'd go to the ""hometown"" once a year but I never really enjoyed it as I kind of was the black sheep. My whole life was dedicated to ""studying well, so that i could get in a good university and have a good job"". That's what I was thought since a very young age. Age 10 and my father would already tell me that I need a good job to live well.

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine yourself, age 10, wanting to be i don't know, a singer, but already knowing it won't be possible. Quite frustrating. Anyways, as the years went by, I started showing interest in art and history, and decided that I wanted to be a teacher. But my parents were against it: ""teachers are not paid well"",""yeah we all had this dream""... etc. I stuck to the idea though, so in high school we had to choose from 3 categories and I chose Literature and Philosophy. My parents were really mad. I didn't tell them, they expected me to go into science or economy. But I didn't want to. I had the best two years of my life, loved my teachers, the classes, everything. And then came the college applications: I found out that even if I wanted to, I couldn't become a teacher because of a nationality problem. So I gave up. Told my parents I'm going to law school (since it was the only thing left), they were really happy. I got into law school, moved to the west, here I am.

&amp;#x200B;

I started university, and I hated it. I'm still in it, and I still hate it. The first thing I got when I got there was a fucking flyer of a far right group: i'm a gay woman of color. It's the last thing I wanted to see. I hated the classes, hated the subjects, I hate law in general, and I spent 3 weeks crying because I don't want to be no lawyer. But I'm in a really well known university, I can't just leave, it costs so much and I've worked so hard to get here. So I called my parents and told them I was thinking of going into History (which is in the same university, so I would just transfer). My dad told me he didn't immigrate and work his ass off so that I would be a working class person. Great. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I told myself that I was just here to study for a job. That's it. I started doing things after class, like going to political discussions, or meeting people from dating apps. It's great, I do enjoy it. But I still can't feel good. The gov is passing on reforms that are really bad for foreigners, so I tried to join the far left groups in my university, but I was so disappointed. I found myself with white bourgeois art students who clearly didn't care and didn't do much except argue on who is the most radical . I felt excluded so I left. Now i'm in a marxist organisation that isn't in university, but I don't do much, I only go there to listen. I like it, I like how it gives me hope, but again, I feel empty. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I just don't care about anything anymore. I go to university systematically, as if it was programmed. I don't even do any political action in my university (i used to think it was really important) and honestly, I don't want to do anything anymore with anyone in my university. I'm constantly loosing faith, I'm starting to not believe in religion anymore and as ramadan is coming, I'm worried that I won't have enough faith to do it. I'm still a marxist, but I feel very much alone and I used to be constantly hopeful for a change and now I don't know, I'm quite tired of waiting for people to get toghether.

&amp;#x200B;

 I feel like my whole life was dedicated to making money and consuming. I used to be a talented person, I knew how to sing, play guitar, compose music, paint and draw, I had everything to start a career. Now I'm empty, no ambitions, no nothing. And it's not as if I'd be willing to give up and go do what I like, cause I don't even know what I like anymore. It's like I have become a complete stranger to myself. I don't know. I have no one to talk to, so that's why I'm on the internet.

Shortly after that I found out she stole tons of money from me. My brother, my only family member I still talk to besides my mom, just walked away when I confronted her about the thousands of dollars of missing money charged out of my savings on cigarettes and clothing for herself with documentation of her purchases. Ive stopped talking to my non immediate family and father because they always treated me poorly at best and I didn't want to come out as trans to people I didn't even like just so they could all be rude to me.

I have a significant family history of mental illness, and sometimes it seems like it is impossible to overcome this. I am so paranoid sometimes. I feel like everyone hates me and they would be better off if I was just gone, especially my husband.

I feel like I might be boring her now, because we usually end up in a short (but fun) round of relatively plain sex. Both of us get off, and sometimes she suggests a round 2 but it’s always the same. We’ve texted about trying to switch up positions and try new things but I feel super uncomfortable even telling her I think she’s hot because of my insecurity. 

I have a very low self esteem but I think I know where specifically my sexual anxiety comes from. 3 places. 
1) I had a short term girlfriend when I was a teen and I tried to escalate some fun times, and there was a quick, stark “no.” I respected the no and stopped but we never talked about it and I totally overthought it at the time. 
2) I have a fetish I’m super uncomfortable talking about and I know is very outside “normal” or “accepted” fetishes. 
3) in high school some bullies spread a rumor that I masturbated in class and even though nobody directly teased me about it, I was called in to the principals office and had to tell them I had no idea what happened and it really affected my last year of high school emotionally. 

If anyone knows of a way, or has suggestions on how I can work through some of this, please let me know. I want my sexual relationship to be a lot more healthy and open, I’m really tired of feeling like casual vanilla sex with my girlfriend is taboo even though she’s more in to it than I am. 

TL;DR- have very low self esteem and body issues. Was bullied and had rumors spread about me touching myself in school. Now I have a really hard time discussing sex with my SO and I want to be more accepting of myself. ",28Mar2019,1
142,"I feel very weird and not really like myself. 



Just a backstory I was depressed a couple years ago and now face new problems after coming out of it. 



One of them being anxiety more specifically social anxiety this has tagged on to me ever since my darkest days. 



I'm now in the stage where I need to make moves and make things happen, before I get into this I'll give more context. 



I'm a 19 guy in my last year of high school and will graduate high school soon, this was supposed to be ""my year"" the one where I stopped bullshitting and became my best self, and well it hasn't really been that way.



While I have met new ""friends"" and have learned more I'm still living the same shitty day over and over again, making excuses, lying to myself, etc... 



As you can see I'm a hot mess and I'm beginning to feel a little defeated just typing this. Currently I'm trying to learn why I'm so sensitive or what western culture calls a ""snowflake"". I'm debating whether or not if I'm too sensitive or if there are people in life and mine who are dicks. 




What makes mean things mean? Why are some people assholes? Why are some so emotional? Why am I so emotional? What's the difference between me being too sensitive and someone being disrespectful towards me? It's like I have no grounding, no identity, no principles. 




I'm also pretty lost on the idea of God, I consider myself agnostic. Currently I'm beginning to lean more towards agnostic atheism, but I don't consider myself as such yet. 




I live in a devoted Christian household, so they're at I think they are under the impression that I'm Christian too. I guess you could say I'm an in the closet agnostic. I'm also bi so that's another issue in it's self entirely. 




I just want to know why I'm so fucked up and such a loser why do I care what everyone thinks of me? 




Why do I overthink all the time? Why am I socially awkward? Why do I lie to myself and others? Why don't I give up? Why can't i be myself without being ridiculed or judged harshly?  




Some of these are dumb questions, but i just don't get other people, i really don't. 




Maybe this has to do with me being a covert narcissist, like i was studying a while back. 




Am I a sympathy hor for posting this or wanting to talk about my problems Even though I don't really care that much about others? 




Also why am I so selfish? And arrogant? 




Most people more than likely won't be able to answer these considering we don't actually know each other, so I guess I'm just rambling now. 





I wonder should I just quit now, I'm starting to realize how weak I am. No wonder I'm so lame. Enough of my pity party, I guess this is it.

143,"I am unhappy and dissatisfied with my life and even though I try really hard to make things better nothing I do seems to ever be good enough. I wanted to kill myself so much but didn't due to relgion and now I'm just stuck here not knowing what to do or how to come to terms with the fact that I don't have the life that I want. Here's what's going on in my life.

Relationship: tried to find a wife since I was 17 (23 now) and had five years of straight rejection. Had an arranged marriage to a girl who at first I thought was the hottest thing going but now I just feel like she's average and nothing special. I can't come to terms with the fact that I'll probably never date a top tire model looking woman. Am considering getting high class prosititues but probably won't because of relgion. My fiancée has her own issues and we had a very disfunctional relationship, I basically told her to loose weight, let me have side girls and become a nurse or I wouldn't marry her and she did. Still I feel like it's just two people with serious issues settling. I know settling is wrong but I feel like the best move is just to marry her so I will.

P.S I don't know why it's been so hard for me to find a girlfriend, I am hot (see profile for pics of me and my fiancée).

Health: have really bad anexiy and constantly feel like I'm suffocating and my heart is out of control. 3 cardiology vists and hundreds of trips to the A&amp;E have failed to find anything physically wrong so was diagnosed with anexiy and hypochondria. Recently got rediagnosed with autism (though I was over it) and it's depressing as hell. On the plus side no ""real"" health problems. Also have a messed up body from being morbidly obese when I was younger (loose skin and shit).

Carrer: busted my ass for five years to graduate with a top level mechanical engineering degree from a top level university. I work as a bank staff teaching assistant for retarded kids and make about £100 a week. Literally applied to hundreds of jobs and been to dozens of interviews but am always rejected or fired in the first few months. I did not work myself into a full scale nervous breakdown for this. 

Other stuff: family environment sucks, am bored with life.

Good stuff: rich parents who let me leech in their £1,000,000 mansion. Very loving okay looking fiancée. No pshyical health problems. Okay car. Have about £37,000 in savings (Leeched from parents / disability). No responsibility. 

Basically I feel scammed and want to die. I feel like it is in everyone's best interests including my own if I die. I don't want to be an autistic leech but I am. I want to make millions, drive lambos and marry super models but I can't. I can't accept how different my life is from what it should be and am a complete nervous wreck because of it. Therapy hasn't worked also, it goes so deep I don't think it can. 

If anyone knows how I can get over this and live a happy life please let me know. Thanks for reading if you're still here.",28Mar2019,0
144,"To make matters worse, I'm 100% financially independent. I don't live with anyone. I don't have a partner to help split the bills and support me. I've been freaking out all day; I feel like I'm going to puke. Now I'm thinking about asking my doctor to prescribe me daily clonazepam again just until I find a good job. I can't handle the anxiety and stress. I don't have a college degree, and I feel lucky I landed this job(with the recommendation of a friend). I'm not sure how I'll find a job that pays as much.

145,"Lose out on sleep and become a general cunt to people? End-of-the-world persona, toxic, very jealous, petty, unwilling to work anything out with people who try to help, seeing other people in a very unfair light? Very hard to accept kindness from others, maybe because of the overwhelming desire to hole up somewhere and temporarily remove myself from the world until I get enough sleep. Which, you know, rarely happens ha. Very puerile, and I know so, and knowing so just makes things worse. How is it that some people can deal with simple tiredness, they manage not to revert back to a two year old tantrum. Shouldn’t be a struggle.",28Mar2019,1
146,"me and my SO are each in individual therapy, and we are also in premarital counseling.

we sometimes talk to each other about our individual sessions. he told me today that he never talks about our relationship (only during small talk), or his relationships with his friends or his family. he only talks about himself and ways to cope with his personal issues within himself. 

I talk about my personal issues in therapy but I usually bring it back to how such and such issue relates to my interpersonal relationships and how I view them. I don't think I've gone one whole session without mentioning my SO, a friend or a family member. 

my SO had a complicated childhood that I would consider traumatic, but he says he doesn't talk about it with his therapist. 

I'm no expert or professional by any means so I'm just wondering how common this is and how helpful it can be. i would appreciate any thoughts and anecdotal experience about how often relationships of any kind come up in other people's individual sessions. ",28Mar2019,1
147,I had a traumatic experience about a month ago and have been feeling really numb emotionally since. I don’t feel the same and feel as if my memories and past didn’t really happen as I can’t connect emotionally to them if that makes sense. I’m struggling a bit with this and a bit worried. I think I had depersonalization for a week after it also but anyways just looking for some advice and if this is common the way I’ve been feeling. Thanks 🙏🏻 ,28Mar2019,1
148,"When I (18F) was about 13, I developed an eating disorder and about a year later I was hospitalized for about three months for treatment before I was released. That’s honestly really just some background info I felt like I should include. One thing I can’t really seem to let go of is my constant worry. First of all, I’ve never been diagnosed with anything other than my eating disorder and I in no way feel like I need another diagnosis, but some support and coping strategies would be helpful right now because this entire week has been a chaotic hell. I’m not sure if this is going to make sense, but it’s the little things that I’m unfamiliar/uncomfortable with that really fill me with an intense dread. For example, I just got hired for a new job today and while I completely understand that it’s normal for anybody to be nervous when first starting out, I feel like my chest has been sinking and the thought of going in to work makes me want to just outright go quit my job. It’s the same thing with driving in places I’m unfamiliar with or even just going to the grocery store sometimes. I can’t seem to do anything alone with having to tell myself to “suck it up” first. On weeks like this where I have a lot to do, my mind is constantly thinking of what I have to do next and what I have to do in the upcoming days, etc. It’s just tiring. I can’t relax. Back when I went to see my therapist, she suggested maybe I try some meds to help with my worries, but of course I opted not to do that because a side effect of the meds is weight gain. I’m obviously not in a very healthy place right now and considering I’m about to start college and have so many new things and experiences thrown at me, I feel a sense a hopelessness. Am I just overreacting about all of this too? ",28Mar2019,1
