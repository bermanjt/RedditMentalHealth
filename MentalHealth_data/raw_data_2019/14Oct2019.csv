0,"So one of my pass times has been video games, I always played them to escape. I’ve always got made fun of my voice, and I know I don’t have the most appealing voice but with that being said I just brushed it off because what can you do? 

I am a very self conscious person and it has seemed to happen more and more often.  I play games where talking in game should be expected. I am generally minding my own business and out of no where I get made fun of for an hour straight till the game is over because they find personal enjoyment out of making me fell like shit. 

What should I do to combat these feelings? I’ve always been self conscious about my voice and people online always make me feel worse. I have depression and use video games to try and escape sometimes.",14Oct2019,1

I don't know what needs to happen but I need my brain rewired. I want to have the motivation to live a normal healthy life but my own brain just won't let me. I don't know what to do anymore.

2,"Initially, I was going to post this on /r/depression, but I think this type of post may be against one of the sub's rules, so here I am.

The subject matter may have already been discussed here before, but this is a fresh feeling of mild disbelief in nonsense I think I may have witnessed (I acknowledge that I may be wrong in my assessment of the material I'm about to discuss), and I'd like to bring it up again.

Before I continue: **THIS IS NOT IN ANY WAY A SUGGESTION THAT ANYBODY SHOULD EVER KILL THEMSELVES. I DO NOT WANT THAT FOR ANYBODY. I AM SIMPLY DISCUSSING THE ATTITUDES OF PEOPLE WHO CASUALLY DISMISS/DIMINISH THE STATE OF THOSE WHO MAY FEEL SUICIDAL.**

I was watching a YouTube video regarding some Belgian woman who was interviewed regarding her petitioning her government to allow her to die. My focus will not be on the woman and the issues I have with her, only because they aren't in the scope of this discussion. Instead, I want to look at a number of things about the video which left me... *frustrated*:

1. The YouTuber speaks about 

&gt; ... the most privileged and wealthiest generation...

and
&gt; ... making sure they never experience any hardship...

What the hell? Not even 10 seconds in, and there's bullshit everywhere.

* What does generational wealth (not even *personal* wealth) have to do with one's mental health? How does it help one if one's generation (again, not one personally) is wealthier than that one's age 50 years ago, but one cannot afford the medications **necessary** (in some cases) to manage one's condition? How do you explain Anthony Bourdain, Robin Williams, etc., successful individuals not from this generation who also went out on their own terms?
* The article the YTer reads doesn't go into any detail about her past, so how does he know what hardships she has faced? I personally cannot claim to have had a particularly traumatic single life experience (probably because I don't think in those terms anyway. I've been reduced to nonchalant acceptance of my situation, no matter what it is), yet here I am, being toyed with by bipolar disorder. Am I supposed to have some sob story to make an *official diagnosis* more... official? I often see people saying things like, ""Sometimes I don't feel quite so bad, which makes me feel like my depression isn't serious, which makes me feel even more like shit than usual"", or others like myself, who don't consider any one event to have been a ""cause"" for their condition. Attitudes displayed in the second quote don't help anybody.

This guy then follows up with
&gt; ... You get young people who are petitioning the government to allow them to die...

OK, I can see where you're going with this...
&gt; ... because they can't handle the *unbearable mental pain*

This may simply have been a tic from him, but between his tone (I've watched lots of his videos before. He uses the same tone when he wants to stress that he finds something unbelievable), and the simultaneous shaking of his head, there seemed to be a bit of *disdain* coming from him.

Is unbearable mental pain an oxymoron? A physical or logical impossibility? If not, then why the disdain? Just how common is this view? It's difficult to be thorough in explaining the mind of, say, someone with major depression, and most of us have difficulty expressing our own thoughts/feelings to other people. No matter how elegant one may be with their words, I am of the view that only those who've experienced the things you're expressing (no matter how clumsily) can understand. Not to be too philosophical, but can one even empathise with someone whose experiences one doesn't understand? If I say to you, ""I find it difficult to gather the physical strength/mental resolve to brush my teeth (EVEN WHEN I'M ALREADY IN THE BATHROOM) and haven't done so in 8 days"", how many people will *understand* that? No matter what else a person may have experienced/lost, they've most likely never known what it's like to be stripped of their will. You know, that thing that comes before ***any*** voluntary action? Anyway, if people are this dismissive this openly, they will continue to be surprised when others drop dead around them, then wax lyrical about how ""happy"" they seemed. Nobody wants to share their deepest struggles with people who would, unprompted, reduce those like them to coddled brats.

I'm still only 18 seconds into the video...

3,"I have a powerful gift, just like the kid in that movie the sixth sense. I'm a psychic medium. Though, it's different for me since I'm an adult, and sometimes I have sex with the spirits as well. Just last night I made love to the ghost of a hooker that died back in July of 1930, and it was truly the best sex I ever had. 

I'm a very level headed person and not crazy at all. And yet my stupid cunt psychiatrist wants to put me on meds and threatens to send me to an asylum if I don't. My shrink is really fucking dumb honestly. I think if I just fill the scripts and flush them down the toilet..... she probably won't figure it out. 

Hopefully people here will be able to see that I really do have powers. I'm one of the most enlightened people on Earth. And I truly do have a gift. I can see the other side. Even my roommate doesn't believe me though and says I should just listen to the shrink, but he's pretty fucking dumb honestly so I don't give a rat's ass if he believes me or not honestly.

7,"i've been struggling with thoughts and such for a while and i've had a friend try to get me help/to help myself. he did this by turning me into my school and basically forcing me to see a therapist, but him doing that made me wanna hurt myself more than i already was and going to the therapist has made me wanna do it more too. i don't trust my therapist at all and seeing my friend makes me incredibly angry as of recent. my sister has also tried to help me by letting me talk but she doesn't know when to not say anything even though i've tried to spell it out for her. i don't understand why their attempts to help are hurting so much but it feels like i can't tell anyone anything anymore because they'll just hurt me with the response.

9,"I live in the US. I don’t go to the doctor often, so I don’t really know how it works especially regarding something like this. I always thought you had to go to a doctor and then get referred to a specialist or something but someone told me that you can just go to a GP and that you can also just go to a specialist directly. I’m confused and really just need somewhere to go. 

I called this public mental health center which I thought was specifically for people who couldn’t afford something expensive, and she was like oh honey you have to be referred. I don’t have insurance, and think it’s annoying I have to be referred when I know the type of specialist I would need to see anyways. I don’t really care if I get meds or therapy or what, I just want something that will work and something I can afford. 

If you’ve had experience going to a doctor for this in the US, can you help me figure out what to do? I can’t even remember the last time I went to the doctor, but since I was always a kid going for a cold or something, I don’t wanna put down “anxiety” and have them be like uhh we don’t do that here lol.",14Oct2019,2

It's the only thing that brings me some form of joy or peace in my otherwise monotone life. Whenever I have a bad day or if someone pisses me off I think about how good it would feel to- ya know- hurt them. Animals I've decided would be a good place to start just to see if I'm being real about this or if it's just fantasy. I guess it's not since any logical person who's felt this way tells no one and just starts. I know it is the only thing I'm passionate about as sad as that is. I'm just addicted to pleasure.

I stream somewhat often and dedicate my streaming towards speaking on my issues, raising awareness about mental health and treatment, and just showing people that we can all stay positive together. Today I am doing my first 24 hour live stream. I am making sure all donations are sent to NAMI, the national alliance of Mental Illness, and my goal is to just try and show everyone that we can make a difference no matter how big or small. I am not asking for donations, I am not asking for you to follow or subscribe, I just want you to come tune in and ask any questions you like, and help contribute towards spreading awareness.  


Thank you everyone for supporting me and for supporting mental health, and thank you for being here with me tonight. I have a really good feeling this will work out well and am so excited to do this!

14,"I feel as if something else is going on. Not necessarily internally or anything, but more like I feel as if I have something more severe like CPTSD. 

There are periods in my life I can't remember. It's like a brick wall. I can remember the traumas at certain ages, but nothing else. I also have had insomnia since I was a teen, I have taken antidepressants before (didn't do anything but make the depression worse and make me gain 30 lbs in a year). I've seen posts on social media about how people get their brains scanned in MRIs (I think that's the one at least) to see how bad their PTSD is and I feel like I should know how bad it is. I go to therapy on a monthly basis and it helps a lot, but I feel as if something is missing. Like there's something else going on in my brain that hasn't been unearthed yet. 

There are certain things I don't do anymore because they remind me of past abusers. Certain songs and topics I avoid because that's what my abusers talked about. I cut off toxic relationships really easily and establish boundaries well. I stick up for myself. I know how to have the difficult conversations. But how do I go about finding out what else is wrong? I'm not sure how else to explain it.",14Oct2019,6

He had a really good run and found a new job among other positive, productive things and has consistently taken his meds, but he recently has been succumbing to paranoid delusions (CIA infiltrating his life trying to get him to do “bad stuff”) and I don’t know how to help. I’ve asked him if he is still taking his medication and he says he is, but this relapse into paranoia has flared up nonetheless. I want to help but due to inexperience I don’t know how. He’s a really good friend and I told him he can come over to my house to get away from his circumstances and get his mind off that stuff but beyond that I’m at a loss and want to help a good friend.

17,"Some info on her; she has generalised anxiety and depression. When she has depressive episodes it tends to be about how she believes all she does is hurt everyone, which isn’t true, she blows thing out of proportion and blames herself for other people’s problems. As a result she attempts to push people away and remove them from her life to protect them. 

In her current episode she has for the most part removed herself from the friend group we are both apart of and broken up with me, when she did so she told be she still has feelings for her ex and that a small part of her wanted to be back with him.

I asked my friends for advice and they said we both needed space and managed to convince me of this, so I relayed this to her, but I guess to her it sounded like me agreeing with her stance of “we need to break up so I don’t hurt you anymore” and she said that she lied about her having feeling for him and only said it to push me away and make me let her go.

She has booked a session with a therapist this week and will likely be put on meds. She is having suicidal thoughts. She also says that therapy and meds will never het her to a good enough head space to deserve me and that I need o move on and find someone more deserving of my love. 

Today she said that she will be fully committed to this decision and that the only thing that would’ve helped was seeing me, but I can’t see her because I have to go onto university and I don’t have a liscense or car.

I just want her back and for her to get help, idk what to do. Thoughts?",14Oct2019,1
18,"I’ve struggled with depression since 2012, and came close to committing suicide twice closer to that time. 

Ever since then, at times of uncertainty or low mood I’ve always had suicide at the back of my mind; not plans to actually carry it out, just the notion that it’s always an *option*. 

I never considered this way of thinking harmful or disturbing until very recently. Even though there are positive events and changes happening in my life, I keep having short periods (from a few hours to a day or two) where I feel really low and I internally remind myself that if things go wrong or I become seriously unhappy again, I can always just end my life. 

I’m just now considering going back to the doctor to get some treatment or see a CBT or something(?). 

Anyone else think like this sometimes?",14Oct2019,2
19,"Basically what the title says. 

A few years ago I was had a job as a life insurance salesman. When i started the job my daughter was just a few months old, so the first thing policy I sold was to myself.  At the time things were going well for me, so the policy I bought was for $800,000. 

Well since then my life has completely imploded. My wife cheated on me and then divorced me. She moved in with her new boyfriend about 1 month after I moved out. I had to leave my job as a life insurance salesman because I wasnt making enough to live on and for the past 3 years I have been working dead end job after dead end job just to try to make ends meet, and I havent been that successful at that so I have managed to rack up around $12,000 in credit card debt that I am struggling to pay off. I am about to default on my student loans, and every day I sink deeper into my depression, making dealing with these issues that much harder. I dont know how to dig myself out of this pit, which is mostly financial and 100% my own fault for making poor choices over the last 5+ years. 

For a few weeks now I have been contemplating just ending it. My $800,000 in life insurance would pay off all my debt and make my daughters life significantly better. She is only 4 and with the interest she would accrue over the next 14 years she would hardly have to worry about anything for a very long time. Basically everything that is wrong in my life right now would be erased with little to no consequences, other than the fact that I wouldn't be there. Her mother is very loving and has a much more stable life. She is in grad school right now and has good long term prospects.

I just cant seem to shake the fact that by taking myself out of the equation, everyone else stands to gain a lot. 

Sorry for the novel, but I really needed somewhere to vent these thoughts and I have no idea where to go from here. 

Tl;dr: I fucked up my life and cant help but feel like all my mistakes can be erased by ending things because I have $800,000 worth of life insurance.",14Oct2019,1

21,"My insurance covers my mental help.. but of course.. I’d have to wait about 5 months or so to get the help I need. I was thinking of even signing up for better help, online therapy, just because I need a professional to talk to so bad. I want to better myself.. but I’m unsure how to when I have all of these mental disorders, a few of which are disabling. I think of small goals everyday to at least feel like I’m getting better, but it doesn’t feel like enough due to how small they are. Such as drinking one water bottle everyday, eating three times a day, spending more time with my family and dogs, learning a new language, and learning more about my mental illnesses. All of these are good and all.. especially if they’re being done consistently, but I feel like I’m not doing as much as I should at this age. I have an awful fear of going outside that affects everything. I’m such a shut in, that I don’t yet have an ID even (getting one in two weeks). I’ve never worked for anyone other than my family a day in my life. And I’ve never had friends. 

I want to live life. I want a job, I want to go to college to study biology or be a flight attendant. I want to have friends. I don’t want to live with these insecurities and fears anymore, or at the very least, I want to know how to handle them. I don’t have hobbies and most of the things I want to do can’t be done in my home away from everyone. I’m an introverted person but I prefer being outside then inside. But all of this... most of my problems can only be figured out with the help of a professional paired with medication. What can I possibly do with myself until then? Anyone else had to wait a while for mental help? This isn’t the first time I had to wait a bit to see someone.",14Oct2019,2
22,"Hi. As said in the title, I regularly think that suicide is my only future, while not really, you know feeling that way. But when this thought comes up, I feel kinda helpless and very sad, like I understand that I should probably go get help, but in the same time I don't have any plans, I am right now safe, and these thoughts don't appear very often, once a few months. But the real reason I don't want to get help and why I even have these thoughts is that I am disappointed in my life and in the world in general. 
Setting aside disappointment with the whole world, because I can't really do anything about that, I guess the logical thing to do would be starting fixing my life, and accepting that some opportunities have been lost for me, and that I made some mistakes in life, but I don't think I can do that right now. I lack the motivation to start fixing my life because of the whole ""welp, I am going to die very soon anyway, so why bother?"" thing, and inability to accept the mistakes I made and opportunities I missed - whenever I play/played a game and something I didn't like happened, and I knew it was my fault and I could avoid that, I would just reload an earlier save, but there are no saves in life, but I still feel the same. 
Some of you might say that I should just accept the world as it is, accept my life as it is, and move on, but it's not that simple. I mean, I could try to just ignore the problem and try to live like that, but it didn't work out the last time I tried that. So my only choice would be to somehow change my worldview regarding, well, the world, and also my position about past mistakes and missed opportunities. Honestly, this seems like such a huge heap of work, that I am not even certain I would get it done by retirement (I'm not even in my 30s btw), and for me, right now, the resulting life seems like it wouldn't even be worth it (but then, I guess, that IS the problem)
So, yeah, any advice? Should I even bother seeking help, or would this not be considered some kind of mental problem? Last time I tried going to a mental health professional, they didn't find any problems with me, and I was actively suicidal, feeling anxious and acting with bursts of energy, followed by apathy at the time. So I don't think this would even be considered some kind of problem (at this point I am just seeking validation and attention on this sub, I don't really believe in recovery)

I’m not autistic, never known someone personally who was autistic (besides a friend of a friend with Aspergers), and while I know that autism is a spectrum and not every case looks the same, I’m sort of worried about the number of people who claim to have this disorder. Is this another mass misdiagnosis like ADHD in the 2000s? Is this another fad like borderline and bi-polar was not too long ago?

I lived in a “quarter way” house at age 20 with some of the most severely ill people you might never have seen. Half a dozen of them suicided within four years. None of us got better. 

Most of my former colleagues are not working. Some have been arrested. Many abuse drugs. Probably more have since died unnaturally. 

I first wanted to die at age 9. It hasn’t gotten better. 

The reason isn’t a chemical imbalance in my brain. 

It’s that life, per se, is terrible. It’s literally a killer. Our environment can only be changed so much according to the specifics of the misery we choose to surround ourselves. I have chosen a temperate climate close to my parents’ home—but with it comes the need to work work work to pay the rent. 

And that’s just the physical environment. Think about how toxic it is that we are expected to spend 8+ hours daily from age five working for free, so our parents can be wage slaves without our interference. 

Add to that an atypical brain and you’re toast for life. 

I am lucky. And I’m telling you, if you’re young and miserable and hoping for the end, it might never get better for you, either. Liars and the pat will tell you it will, but neither the encouragers nor you know it to be true, and your agency is limited to change it. 

The sympathies that may come easier for you now might diminish with time, or you’ll have to rinse your life out repeatedly and repopulate it with new folks who can understand for a spate but leave for their own sanity. 

But they’re not sane. You are. And you know it doesn’t get better. How could it?

There’s no “and that’s okay” or “so make the most of it” or “then change your mindset” or “go try xyz” here. Just the simple fact that for some of us, many of us, life does not improve, through no fault of our own nor lack of initiative on our part. 

But either immediately or eventually, we die. (That’s not sweet, either.)",14Oct2019,0
33,"Hi everyone! Recently I’ve been feeling less like myself. More tired, less interested in the things that I used to love, and I’m having a hard time motivating myself to clean my house or even do simple tasks like making dinner. Sometimes I have a burst of energy and I’m able to do these things, but in the last couple months I have been struggling. 

I’m a 25 year old female that works 2 part time jobs (so about 60 hours a week). I have support from my wonderful family, but I do work in the zookeeping field. My family is a bunch of lawyers and doctors and they support me as much as they can, but I still get comments about going back for grad school or doing something that will make me more money. I have no interest in doing either of those things. I’m very passionate about both of my jobs and I love what I do and who I work with. 

Even with my love for work, I feel like it’s all a facade. I spoke with my boyfriend about it today, and he said that I’m probably just in a weird funk because I haven’t been eating right or drinking enough water or exercising like I normally do. I don’t want to self diagnose myself, but on the other hand I also have like 2 days off a month between all my jobs so I don’t really have a lot of free time to go to an actual doctor that’s not my parents. 

I understand that depression is a chemical imbalance in the brain, but I’ve never experienced this before. When I was in college I was a full time student with two majors taking around 18 credits a semester and always had at least 2 part time jobs, plus extra curricular. I’m used to the always busy lifestyle but when I slow down I tend to get stir crazy. 

I have a lot of friends and I’m almost always out and about doing something with someone. When I take time for myself I feel like I’m letting people down for saying no. Most of my “free time” I end up doing things with other people. 

Should I take some time off to see a doctor and figure this out or am I just overworked and need to take a couple mental health days to recharge? Sorry this is so long. Thanks!

TLDR: I work too much, I hang out with friends a lot, and I hardly take time for myself. I’m not feeling myself recently, and basic tasks seem daunting to me. Am I overworked or depressed?",14Oct2019,2

35,"What is the best way to truly get out of a mental funk? I've always been an optimist. The glass has always been half full, and any difficult situation or issue has always been met with a silver linings and an ""is what it is"" attitude. But lately, this hasn't been the case. Some things have happened, and the past month has felt like everything is spiraling out of control. It's like the weight of all of these issues that have been layering on top of me for years is finally causing me to buckle/break. My attitude has slowly become worse, and today was probably the first time having the feeling of truly not wanting to exist. As I write this, it's Sunday at 9:30.

36,"Not just tests, homework too. Pretty much anything where I have to complete it for a grade. I get upset really easily towards school because of how it views the mind as this one, standardized thing. I know I’m creative, smart, and all the other nice things people tell you, but school does not allow me to show this, at least how I would like to do so. I like being online and interacting with people all over the world, not just my classmates. I like learning at my own pace, and not feeling stressed with redundant tests and assignment due dates that are existing for a systematic purpose. I like thinking of new businesses and ideas and asking the world what they think, and how they can help. That’s why we’re here right? To help each other? In helping others you help yourself, but school teaches you in helping others you are a cheater. School is the most standardized aspect of our society.

38,"I have cyclothymia disorder. This is something I’ve already been diagnosed with along with anxiety. I’m not having a good week, or month for that matter. 

I quit my job recently to move out of state and am still job hunting so I’ve been without health insurance for the past month and a half. (Moved with my fiancé because he wanted to be closer to family but we are still 4 hours away from his mom’s house and neither of us know anyone in the city we’re currently in.) During this time, I noticed I started having suicidal thoughts so I stopped taking my medicine. Suicidal thoughts did stop. However, I can feel my moods swinging back and forth, I don’t feel like they’re stable.

To add to this, my mother is very unsupportive and rude to me intentionally. Fiancé and I picked out a wedding date at the end of the school year. My mom said she wouldn’t allow my siblings to attend the wedding and proceeded to mock me by saying they weren’t my siblings, they are her kids and she will decide if they can come or not. So I had a full blown panic attack, sobbing and couldn’t breathe. I’m still quite upset from it. We ended up agreeing to change the wedding date to a summer month. That doesn’t make me feel any better though because it doesn’t make my mom love me any more at the end of the day.

Then, my fiancé hasn’t been working for a few months. He left his job in spring because he was unhappy with the company culture. Since then he has decided he wants to start his own business but claims he needs a home base to start any of it (including research/prep) which isn’t possible right now since I’m still job hunting and we might need to move where I can find a job. This along with the fact that he doesn’t do anything except golf when he can or drink beers and watch tv at home has brought out a somewhat mean side to him. As of late, he has been (unintentionally) nitpicking at things I say/do (or don’t say/do). 

Then today we ordered a pizza and the shop messed up the order but only on my pizza. When I called, they wouldn’t fix it and bring me a new one. My fiancé told me I would have to get over it. 

I feel as if I’m going crazy.

I’m stressed because I haven’t found a job. I’m stressed from wedding planning. I’m stressed because it seems my wedding planning efforts are futile. I’m stressed because my mom hates me and it’s so obvious and I just want a normal mother-daughter relationship. I’m stressed because my fiancé won’t get off his ass and do something...anything...towards preparing to be a business owner. I’m stressed because he also keeps picking on me, intentional or not. AND I’m stressed because I have no one I can talk to, hug, and tell me things will be okay.

45,"Backstory; a friend that I made pretty recently but have gotten close to in my short time knowing him does this thing where he thinks everything is his fault. He also deals with depression and anxiety. He thinks he is a horrible person and that nobody cares about him. He tells me this multiple times a day, he is always calling, texting, stopping by my house, saying he’s having a breakdown or a mental health emergency and needs to talk. 
I care a lot about this person and I would always try to build him back up and tell him what he’s thinking about himself isn’t how I’m feeling. But recently it’s gotten to a point where constantly having to reaffirm him is feeling exhausting for me. I feel like the words I’m saying to him are carefully thought out but they’re going on one ear and out the other.
Today, I told him I think he could benefit from talking to a therapist because it’s getting hard on me to feel like I’m constantly having to be there for him. It’s taking a toll on my mental health. I’m in a relationship and my partner is exhausted with how much he’s saying he needs my time and attention. 
I feel like a horrible friend for suggesting therapy because I’m not equipped to help him...I’m not a therapist and I feel like I’m being treated like his therapist daily.

47,"Just got back home from buying a nice new car, most people would feel great right? Well the dealer told me that the car was taxed an insured only found out it wasn't when I got back home after driving through several ANPR cameras.

I have anxiety and depression issues so I keep my life very ordered and methodical. Now I have no idea if I will end up with a huge fine which I can't afford and points on my license. Can't sleep the anxiety is too much even after drinking three shots of rum, I almost never drink. 

Last time I went to the quacks for help was over seven years ago they were worse than useless now I have a job with a medical check every two years any mental health problem in the last five has to go on the form making it difficult to get work. Just quit my job a few days ago since it wasn't making me happy. Made a promise to myself to only do things that made me happy after the quacks kept percribing pills and rubbish therapists so that I could keep the same toxic lifestyle, friends and job
Getting jobs in the same field will prove difficult if it says this guy is crazy on my medical.

The anxiety though difficult I can live with its the resulting depression that really bothers me. The anxiety helps me to do my job in some ways spotting problems and worrying about them until I can find a solution it just makes me slow. The depression makes it difficult to think of the solutions and the idle suicide day dreams are disturbing. Here I am trying my best and every now and then my mind will go (hey wouldn't it be great to just jump from there and end it all)
I can't do that, I don't have the guts and even if I did it would ruin my parents lives, I'd rather be miserable instead of them.

56,"So for background, my husband &amp; I just had a baby, born 8 weeks early with some complications. Has been in the NICU since 8/19 &amp; is finally doing great, but needed a few surgeries and just generally stressful stuff during this time. He also had just started a new job the week before I gave birth, and since it was 8 weeks early and no one was prepared, he took 4 days off from work while I was in the hospital &amp; our son had his first of 4 surgeries total, and was let go immediately when he returned to work on the 5th day.

So needless to say, my poor husband hasn't been doing good. He's been applying and interviewing for jobs nonstop and finally got hired at one. Finally started feeling better, worked for one week, had to travel out of state for this company &amp; missed 2 of our sons other surgeries. And was let go from that job as well.

We had to put him on my work's health insurance which doesn't cover some of the medications that work well for him, so he's been on therapeutic ""alternatives"" and it's making him worse. He's tired all the time, and not normal depression or exhaustion tired it's like you can literally tell he's chemically tired and I think that played a part in them letting him go. He was also distracted because our son was having a big surgery. It's just been awful. His parents have noticed and thankfully have offered to cover the cost of his medication so he's getting back on what works for him.

I'm trying to stay strong, and stay positive but I just don't know how to help him. I just keep saying ""everything will be okay"" and similar stuff, which I know doesn't help and I know he doesn't believe it right now, and I know he feels hopeless and worthless and all the things. So how do I help him? I'm trying to get his sleeping back to normal but it's hard when there's no reason to get up. He doesn't like going to see our son in the hospital because it gives him anxiety and stresses him out, and he feels out of place and uncomfortable because they're always looking for ""mom"" in the NICU &amp; basically could care less about dad.

I'm just so sad for him. My heart hurts. I know he'll get another job, he's a really great salesman &amp; he's had a ton of great jobs. I know our son is going to be fine and doesn't need anymore surgeries, he won't have any lifelong problems, and will be coming home soon. I know things will get better but I just don't know how to help him see it. It just seems like the blows are never ending. 

He's not currently seeing a therapist, I'm trying to gently suggest that he start going again but I know that suggestion will just bring more stress and worry about finances.

57,"Until just a couple weeks ago, I’ve been super depressed and have been doing really stupid and reckless things. Early August, I nearly killed myself. I don’t remember much of it or why I did it, but I had wrapped a long ribbon around my neck, wrists, and ankles and choked myself out to the point of passing out. I was sitting on my bed while doing this and fell off of it when I passed out. I woke up trying to unwrap myself and trying to gasp for air and eventually got out (obviously) and went into this strange state of mind believing that I was dead. I mean- I obviously wasn’t because my family still saw me and interacted with me so I wasn’t a ghost or anything like that, but it made me realize that I didn’t want to commit suicide. Not necessarily because of the thought of death, but just because of the thought of my family finding me dead on the floor in the morning and ruining their lives forever because their daughter had somehow lost her mind and ended up killing herself.

Since that day on, I had been experiencing major isolation and had a hard time expressing myself. My best friend had always been someone I could confide in, but for some reason I just wanted to isolate myself and I had lost all my trust in her.

Finally, I had a mental breakdown because I had bottled up my emotions for so long that I suddenly started pouring my guts out to her to get any sort of relief and perhaps some sympathy. I told her about how my father was a huge alcoholic and that the doctor said that if he didn’t stop drinking soon, his liver would give out on him and he would eventually die from it. It was definitely a great source of my depression considering that my dad is one of my closest friends. And when I told her, I broke down crying and had to miss and hour of school because I couldn’t focus on anything. Earlier that day, I had a math test and I couldn’t focus on it because of everything on my mind. 

Over the next few days after that, I had continued to pour my guts out to her, even discussing the night I thought I had died and telling her my thoughts and delusion of thinking I was dead. I didn’t tell anyone else about that, because I didn’t know how I was supposed to explain it to anyone and I didn’t want people to worry about me. Even as I had told her all this, I was deeply regretting it despite the fact it felt nice to actually talk to someone about it just because I felt like I was burdening her when she had a much more terrible life than I had. I never liked telling her my struggles because she suffered from depression too because of her trauma of her abusive brothers, her divorced parents, and her house burning down. So when I talked to her about my problems when I had a loving family and a seemingly perfect life, it felt like my problems didn’t matter because I didn’t really have a reason to feel this way.

I also told her about my identity crisis and how I was proud that I always had a good grasp on who I was as a person and then I suddenly lost my perspective of who I was. I didn’t feel like my name was actually my name (I never have. I would respond to it, yes, but my name felt like it belonged to a different person and not me). I told her that I felt like I was an abusive and toxic person despite the fact everyone actually likes me and thinks I’m one of the nicest people they’ve met. The perspective I have if myself feels distorted and exaggerated. I hadn’t realized just how low my self esteem was until I went to the wrong classroom and was surprised when 5 different people were happy to see me joining them and were sad when I realized that I had gone to the wrong classroom (school was short on teachers and so my original class had to combine with another so that we would be watched by staff since we lacked substitutes). For some reason, I didn’t think people were ever happy to see me and so when I saw that many people were happy to see me, even people who I rarely hung out with, it made me realize that my confidence and self worth had gotten really bad.

Now, instead of feeling exhausted and depressed all the time, I’m laughing and having a good time with friends. I’m the happiest I’ve been for a while and it feels great but I feel like it’s not real. I’m still burdened by thoughts and feelings. I’ve been disconnecting from reality really badly. I’ve talked about my delusions and hallucinations in the past, but I feel like this is somehow so much worse. I’m not really hallucinating like I have in the past, but I’m in a totally different world at this point. I want to be an adventurer and go on an epic adventure and leave my life behind. I hate my friends, I hate myself, yet I do so with the happiest grin you would ever see. I’ve gone through crazy mood swings. I’ve gone from laughing hysterically to being super depressed and irritated to the point of yelling and snapping at my friends and back to my hysterical laughter even though I’m not really... happy. I feel incredibly lonely and empty inside. I want to just go mute without anyone being concerned. I want to change my name and just be a different person. I used to have a good idea of who I was and who I wanted to become. But now I don’t know. I want to be a courageous person with the will to help everyone but at the same time I want to be a... villain... I guess. Edgy, I know but it’s harder to explain. I don’t even want to try to explain who I want to be.

About a month ago, I learned that my family was being forced out of our house because our landlord hadn’t been paying his mortgage on our house. We found a new home to live in and I don’t have to leave my friends behind or move schools, but it’s been pretty stressful nonetheless. I wasn’t going to tell anyone about it until we actually started moving, but in a strange fit of laughter, I just shouted hysterically “By the way, I’m moving because our landlord hasn’t been paying his mortgage so we’re being forced out of our house!” My friends were concerned with my laughter while discussing serious situation but I just kept laughing hysterically and didn’t really care despite the fact it had been very stressful for my all that time I had been keeping my mouth shut over it.

I don’t know... I’ve just been feeling really lonely, frustrated, and depressed despite feeling really happy most of the time. When I talked to her about it after feeling really concerned with my recent behavior, my sister, who has a husband that is diagnosed as bipolar, told me that there’s a chance that I might be bipolar as well and that I should get checked out with a doctor so I could get treated for it. But as I said in previous posts, I have a hard time asking for help from a clinical professional. I know I’ve definitely take a step closer to getting there since my last post considering I’m actually trying to be open about it now, but I’m not quite there yet.

Anyways, I’m very sorry for such a long post, I just thought some background info was necessary and I needed a place to write down all my thoughts and experiences where I could get feedback from people who may also be struggling from something similar.

61,"17 M here. I was quite concerned when this started, but I guess I've just gotten used to it by now. 
I used to be able to focus on a somewhat reasonable level and had severe boredom issues if I wasn't doing something to stimulate my mind, now that's out the window and I could literally stare at a blank wall for hours with no shits given. The only way I can describe how it feels for me is that my life kinda feels like I'm watching a movie but i'm on my phone at the same time, only half as attentive as I could be. Like an *I know what's going on, but I'm too busy to invest emotionally in this story* sorta thing. This has been going on nonstop for about 2 years, (save for when I'm severely sleep deprived and down a shit ton of coffee, oddly enough) starting to think waiting it out isn't going to cut it.
Is this a normal occurrence?
Does this happen to any of you? If so, how do you manage?

62,"I remember this weird feeling happening around a year ago, sitting in class I became very ""floaty"" feeling. Immediately I was very uncomfortable and started to break out into a panic attack and feeling like I was going to faint. When i'm having conversations with people I find it very hard to concentrate on conversations because of this ""floaty"" feeling. Also, lights get very intense to me, and I find my self squinting. Even just typing this and thinking about the feeling its making me feel ""floaty"" and squint at my monitor. This all started happening after I started smoking weed with friends. I remember one night we smoked weed and I started freaking out (heart was racing, felt like I was going to die etc) Ever since then I have felt this way and think that weed may have brought out the symptoms of depersonalization disorder but I don't want to self diagnose myself. I have been trying to find a psychologist to make an appointment with. My general doctor didn't do much other than give me hydroxyzine (which I never took) and told me that I had adjustment disorder.

I just want to go out immediately, find a place just for me.

I don't really have a friend or someone close to me. I just contacted to friends to talk about homework or class problems. After gradueted, I didn't keep in touch with then anymore. My family was not happy, my parents quarreled alot since I was a child. I didn't do anything to keep in touch with relatives neither.

When I was child, I thought it would be fine. But now I don't  think so. I tried to find a new friend but I was the one who gave up first. I too scaried to meet new people, I can't believe them. I fear that they will say terrible things about me when they know what kind of people who I am, and they will leave.

I often imaginate about the situations, in which me and people I know  chatted friendly, said some funny thing and I was not affair that they would leave me. But in the reality, I just answer ""ok"", ""yes"" most time people talk to me, with a low voice. I don't know what should I say.

I met a different girl that night, we chatted and exchanged snapchats. She said we should meet up the next day, only to find out later that she deleted me.

I know relying on external validation is not mentally healthy, but it still hurts to feel so unwanted and so unloved. I have so much to offer. I'm intelligent, patient, empathetic, hard working, and decently attractive; I know I have so much to offer, but literally no one cares.

68,"Hello everyone,

So I ended up transferring universities this semester. I really enjoyed the university itself, but I'm pretty sure that the desert it was in was having a big effect on me. The first and fourth quarters were particularly rough for me. Fourth quarter was especially difficult, and I had trouble functioning at times. During this time, I felt extreme sensitivity to light, irritability, depressed mood, lack of motivation, trouble sleeping, headaches, irrational anger, sensitivity to sound, my head felt like it was filled with cotton, chest pains around my heart area, and a constant feeling of hopelessness and doom. I felt like I had to get out of that state as soon as possible while this was all happening. Since not being in the state, I have not felt these feelings, although they will rarely resurface as dim echoes of what I felt before.

Does this sound like it could be anxiety? I have not felt something like this since going to that state, nor have I felt something quite as bad since leaving. I am really worried that it may have been something trivial that would have fixed itself, and that I left some of the best friends I have ever had just for some bad weather. There was some other stuff going on at the time too, like the fact that I was considering changing my major and may have been a little bit homesick. But I don't know if this could have caused all that to happen. If anyone has any insight into this problem, that would be helpful.",14Oct2019,1

I’ve been somewhat isolating myself, spending most of my time at home lying in bed, on my phone, with the door and blinds closed for basically the whole day.

I’ve not wanted to do most things, apart from spending hours on end daily scrolling through Reddit and Twitter. When I actually do stuff I should be doing, I feel like I’m being weighed down.

My mind has been full of negative thoughts, and I just can’t think of anything positive about myself.

I’ve become more anxious, especially socially. Being on the autism spectrum makes socialising hard enough, but this anxiety is just making it much harder.

I’ve only been diagnosed with autism and ADHD. I feel like I may have mild depression/anxiety, but I haven’t been diagnosed, so all of this could be anything. I just don’t know what’s actually wrong, or what to do.

I’ve been seeing a psychologist for quite some time now, and I just have trouble explaining my problems to her. As for friends, I don’t have any friends that actually talk to me/care about me. Family, I don’t feel comfortable telling them, or anyone for that matter, about my problems.

I am constantly overly stressed due to school and home issues, I've lost massive clumps of hair everytime I shower for the past 3 months and now my hairline has a hole right in the middle. I can't eat anymore, yesterday all I ate was 10 whale crackers, today all I ate was a corner of a brownie and I threw up from anger so technically nothing. I either stress eat or I don't eat at all, I've passed out and busted my face on the floor from it, I've lost 15 pounds from 2 months of going from stress eating to eating disorder to my body not being able to eat at all rinse and repeat, I can't keep doing this. I am losing my mind. The only thing keeping me together is weed right now. That is the only time I can eat, the only time I'm happy, the only time I'm not angry or crying, everything is doable when I smoke but when I don't even eating is fucking impossible. Today I think a fire storm of all of this combined hit me at once, this happened about 2 hours ago I woke up at 1230 to see my bathroom light was on and I heard someone in there, I open the door and my cousin is stealing hits off of my wax. Took the rig out of his hand and said ""what are you doing get out"" he doesn't even live here he got kicked out 3 months ago but has my parents wrapped around his finger so he still has full access. He tried to make up some excuse that he was going to buy it off of me, like yeah that makes sense steal half of it THEN buy it from me. I continue to tell him to get out and he doesn't he's just sitting in my room bullshitting me and trying to convince me I didn't just catch him stealing, he even fucks up and admits this isn't his first time stealing hits off of my wax while I'm asleep or not home. I'm getting more mad by the minute because he won't get out so I start screaming get out at him to try and just annoy him enough to make him leave. He doesn't. He eventually makes me so mad I start shaking, I don't remember what happened but I swung at him first (I can't fight I know I didn't hurt him he's twice my size and I have no muscles whatsoever in my arms) after it got physical I swung and missed so he threw me a few times. I tried grabbing him and dragging him towards my door to get him at least out of my room but since I'm 5'1 135 and he's 6ft+ 200+ that didn't do much to get him out, while I was grabbing him he said ""oh your going to kick me out like one of your little flings?"" That made my blood boil, I started shaking and feeling tingling in my face and hands, I got so angry I threw up and he came in while I was throwing up to which I said ""GET THE FUCK OUT ALREADY"" this is 15 minutes after finding him stealing and he still won't leave. After throwing up and having the cold sweats nearly passing out I come back out and there he still fucking is just sitting there. I continue to yell get out but I can't fight anymore because I was so light headed so we are sitting just yelling at eachother 4ft apart when he says ""I would NEVER hit someone over weed"" and I said ""oh saint (his name) screw Jesus they should have put you up on that cross, good on you"" and clapped for him. So then he stood up got in my face and yelled ""SAY IT AGAIN SAY IT AGAIN TO ME"" standing over me, I said ""oh do you feel like a big man now just get the fuck out already"" and the physical fighting started again because I pushed him out of my face back onto the bed he was sitting on, then he pushed me, I grabbed him  and started dragging him towards my door (my stairs have 8 steps from the main floor to a landing then 5 steps from the landing to my door) I get him on the step outside of my door shut the door on him and start walking away, he keeps talking through the door saying shit so I turn around open the door grab him and drag him to the landing and he says ""look at the kind of kid aunt (my mom) and uncle (my dad) raised"" that set me off to no return so I try to drag him down the rest of the stairs to get him closer to the garage door and since he's drunk, yes he showed up drunk to his aunt and uncles house to steal weed from his cousin, he fell down 6 steps and bumped his back on the wall chipping the drywall off. I help him up and get him ice and he pours himself another drink while screaming at me that I'm a horrible person for pushing family down the stairs over weed. This was 30 minutes of telling him to get out of a house he doesn't live in after catching him stealing from me, then insulting me. 30 fucking minutes of ""get out"" wasn't enough warning to get out. He is ok, he only scratched his back and may have some bruises tomorrow. Nobody has ever made me that angry to the point of getting physically sick, I have only put my hands on a person one other time and that was after 8 years of relentless bullying from them. I feel like I have no sanity left, this is not something new. The stress from this situation is the stress I deal with daily, I can't handle this shit anymore. I can't get a break I had such a good fucking day and then my cousin steals from me. I have lost my mind, My anger got to a level I haven't seen it get to before, I'm only 18 I will be dead by 20 if my stress stays this high. I feel like I can't go a week without at least one mental breakdown, this is now 3 for the week, just the week. People will push me until I physically and mentally shut down, I get pushed until I am at breaking point, tonight I got pushed past breaking point, past the point of no return, past any level of sanity left in my brain. I can't keep doing this. I feel fucking horrible for hurting him, I don't want to hurt anyone. I am absolutely broken and I don't know what to do. I can't even talk to my own parents about this because he will just lie to them he tried to lie to me about what happened right after it happened, it's no secret he's more of their child than I'll ever be and he knows it. He tried to tell me that I pushed him down the full flight of stairs top to bottom, that I told him me and my parents don't care about him, that he never went into the bathroom while I was throwing up, that I threw up AFTER pushing him, he was so fucking drunk he didn't even know what had happened and was trying to convince me that it was all me and all my fault like always.

I grew up in a single parent household, no siblings, and my mom was going through men routinely, so I never had a secondary parental figure. From a young age, I was taught that love is tied to how well I fit the mold of what person she wants me to be. Don't get perfect grades? Fine, I'll ignore you for a week. Don't do the chores exactly the way I want them to? Fine, I'll glare at you every time you're in the room for days. Keep perfectly quiet in your room and stay there unless I want you. Your hair isn't brushed the way I like? You are a child and don't know how to take care of yourself. If you're having negative emotions, you're being dramatic, ridiculous. You're coming up with lies just to make yourself feel better. Get over yourself.  


For comfort, instead of coming to my mother, all I had was a large stuffed teddy bear my great-grandmother had purchased as a birthday gift for me. Fast forward to the present - I am terrified of showing negative emotions, specifically being sad, to my partner. Emotions like that were what was attacked when I was young. I find that I am so terrified to show anything (even though he is absolutely not at fault) because I am worried about him changing his mind and leaving me, even after all these years, because he'll have had enough of what my mother described as 'ridiculous'.

This last weekend was awful. My depression and anxieties reached levels I hadn't felt in a long time, and I tried shutting myself away.

I an currently studying in university, had several jobs on and off.
Currently not having a job due to depression but planning on starting soon again (450€ base, couldn't handle more hours while studying).

The city I currently live and study in is very expensive when it comes to living.
I get about 260€ of half-orphans-rent and about 200€ for child-benefit* (?) (*in my country parents get a certain amount of money per child from the state for food and general costs - my father allows me to get that money).

So with a job i would have around 900€, from which more than half would be used for rent.

I feel really guilty for still living at home, but right now I feel like i can not work, due to mental heath...

I was learning new stuff about psychology, sociology, mental health etc (I was doing a counselling certificate). I was barely at work, I was studying something I was so interested in, and I loved it.

But then studying got intense and stressful and I told myself I would take a year out before I decided where I wanted to go next (uni? college? working in a job helping people with MH problems?).

I'm now in my year out and my mental health has plummeted, and I'm stuck in a rut that I don't know how to get out of. I feel as though I'm slowly morphing in to the person I used to be before college and when things were bad.

106,"TLDR: I've been having extreme hallucinations since middle school, seen extremely scary things that still haunt me to this day. Been attacked once by my hallucinations, and they have only gotten worse and more frequent in recent years. Thought it might be genetics because my dad gets them, but not nearly as bad or as often as me. But I'm the only one out of my siblings that gets them. Oh Last thing is I have had some control over them. ( I go into detail on each thing on the entire story below.)

Before I begin, I just want to know if there are any dream/hallucination type enthusiasts that could help me know what I possibly have or why I might have these hallucinations. Thanks

""Quick Summary""

(1) I'm 19 years old, male. Ever since middle school, roughly 7th-8th grade is when I began having hallucinations. Mostly at night. Almost never was it sleep Paralysis, most of the time I have full control of my body. For the first several years of my Hallucinations they were just smaller things, like thousands of spiders crawling on my walls in by bedroom, random objects floating around, occasionally silhouette of people and creatures. I've mostly gotten use to them.

""Over the years""

(2) But as time has passed, my hallucinations have gotten much more freaky, and terrifying. Within Recent years, a big percent of them have become delusional. I often find myself opening my eyes, seeing people staring at me, or people using the things in my room, and I almost feel like it's totally normal, and I even talk to some of them. I do hear them talk back to me, I never can remember what we talked about when I snap out of the delusion, but it scares me none the less. For example, I'll get pissed that these random people are using my PC in my room while I'm trying to sleep, so I tell them to please wait till I wake up. Or Sometimes my entire room changes, and is almost a completely different place with weird things happening and it just seems so normal until I snap back to reality. My Hallucinations have been much more vivid in recent years, and I often find myself getting up from my bed and interacting with my delusional hallucinations. They have become much more frequent. In the early years of the hallucinations, I would experience it maybe once or twice a week, sometimes once a month. But now it's been almost every night, and when I finally fall asleep, I feel so restless in the morning.

""Family genetics?""

(3) Hallucinations have never been in my family except for one case. My dad gets them, but not nearly as bad as me. He barley gets them, and his are minor. So I thought maybe it's a genetic thing, but I'm the only kid in my family of 5 that has them.

""What I've seen""

(4) I'm going to start off with one i had in 11th grade. I was staying the night at my dad's, I open my eyes to what appears to be a silhouette of a head just inches from my face. I heard it breathing. At first I thought it was my older brother just trying to scare me, he would do that type of stuff while I would sleep when I was younger. That's when I started seeing details of the face. The only way I can describe it is the face was Gray, and looked similar to a ""Falmer"" creature from the video game ""Skyrim"" I whispered out ""go away"" and the moment I did that. It jumped off my bed and scurried on all four into my closet. My Heart stopping, I jumped out of bed, ran to the other side of the room and flipped on the lights. My closet was Empty. I can still remember how the breathing sounded.

(5) I've never been attacked by a Hallucination but once. This is arguably the most Terrifying thing I've ever experienced. I was in the 12th grade, It was about 2 AM, I was laying there in the dark talking to my girlfriend (at the time) on the phone. I look across my room in the darkness. I see a really tall 7ft tall and thin woman with scraggly black hair that went down to her shoulders. She was slowly moving towards me. I grab my phone and click the power button. I shine the screen light of my phone onto her. Normally when I do this, my hallucinations go away. But this time it had lit her up, making her appear brighter and I could see more details of her. She was old with really pale skin. Extremely wrinkly and I could see her veins all up and down her arms and face. She was in an old white tank top. Her eyes were extremely sunken in and had dark rings around them. I had never seen so much detail on a hallucination before. When I had gotten a good look at her. She jumped at me so fast as if to attack me. Could almost hear a feint scream when she jumped at me. It scared me so bad It felt as if my heart had stopped, and then restarted itself. It disappeared when it attacked me. My heart was racing so hard I started crying. Luckily my GF was still awake and was there to comfort me.

(6) This next one is sorta funny but at the same time absolutely terrifying. One night in the 12th grade I was laying in my bed. I looked over at my computer in the corner of my room. I saw a 4 ft tall version of Goofy from Disney Violently Choking and shaking around a smaller 2 ft version of Goofy. It slowly faded away. I could hear the sounds of the choking. It was unpleasant to witness, but I kinda laughed it off after it was gone.

(7) I opened my eyes one night and looked at the wall. I saw this man in a chair. The chair was hanging on the wall. He was in older 1800's clothing. He was just staring at me. He started to smile and started laughing. As he laughed his shoulders, arms and legs started to shake. His laughing became louder and more aggressive. The harder he laughed the more violent his arms and legs shook. He was laughing like a Psychopath. It became so aggressive, his legs and arms started shaking around in ways as if they were dislocated and broken. In ways humans shouldn't be able to move there arms and legs. What I did to stop this one I'm going to go a lot more about in the next paragraph. But I had brought up my hands and mentally started thinking about the guy being crushed into a ball. I was using my hands to crush him the same way you pretend to smash peoples heads between your fingers. And eventually it worked. I had crushed him into the size of a little ball. That ball ended up fading away.

""Controlling my Hallucinations""

(8) Lately I have noticed I have slightly more control over my hallucinations. Most the time no, but every once in a while I am able to control what happens to the hallucinations. Sometime's I've been able to get rid of the freaky one's by crushing it into a small ball. Sometimes I'll see random objects floating around my room and I hold out my hand and attempt to control it the same you would pretend to use telekinesis and it actually works. I can sometimes move objects around. This one time I woke up and randomly shot my arm in the air. Above my hand was a silver ball floating. I started to imagine using telekinesis moving the ball back and forward, up and down. Those time's are actually really fun and I do want to experience more hallucinations like that. There was only once I was able to force a hallucination, it wasn't much, but I was staring at my wall one night and just was trying to force something to emerge out of it. And to my luck the corner of what I think was a table came out of the wall but that was it. (More about forced hallucinations at the bottom after the Conclusion.)

""Conclusion""

(9) For a lot of my hallucinations now I have gotten use to them and can just focus on closing my eyes and going back to sleep. But I am absolutely terrified of what I might do during my delusional hallucinations. I have never left my room during one, but it scares me that one of these times I might, and make choices I wouldn't make normally. I would lock myself in my room if I could, but my door doesn't have any locks. The more I think about these delusions the more scared I become. I do want to go see some kind of mental doctor or whatever that could see if I have anything diagnosable, or something. But I do not want to take any mind altering medication. I refuse too. Well this has been my story of my hallucinations. If anyone can make anything of it, please comment below or feel free to DM me. Also if you want to hear more details about my hallucination or have any questions, comments or feel free to DM and I can tell you more about it if you are interested. I'm sorry for making this so long, I just thought I would put everything out there.

...................................................

(Random unimportant thoughts I've had, feel free to ignore this if you want.)

I was talking to my brother, and we had ideas that what if I had trained my hallucination control enough so I could summon whatever hallucinations i want and completely control it, and just have fun every night. Probably mentally dangerous if possible, but and interesting thought nonetheless.",14Oct2019,2

108,"Hi everybody,

First of all sorry for my english, it is not my first language. I'm writing here because I need help/advises for a pretty embarrassing situation and I have nobody to talk to. Sorry for the long post.

I'm 30 years old and I live in Europe. My life consists pretty much in wake up, go to work, return home, go to sleep and repeat. My job can be stressful considering the crazy deadlines and the work enviroment that can be burdensome and toxic sometimes.

On sunday I spend all the day on my computer watching a movie or a sport match. I have not friends or a girlfriend for various reasons (age and life choices/experiences).

For my economic situation I still live in my parents house because I can't afford my own place at reasonable prices (rents are crazy). I still have temporary contracts in my job that doesn't let me to ""invest"" in my own house because of bank's ""restrictions"" for these kind of work-contract. The economy situation of my country doesn't help.

Everything is made way worse by my parents attitude. In the last years their behavior is changed, especially my mother. I don't know if she is getting old in a bad way but she started to ""molest"" me for no reason. Some examples:

* She keep watching me in my ""private"" parts;
* She create obvious situation to show herself in a sexual behavior (bend over, jokes and others disgusting stuff);
* She put her underwear in my clothes;

And other disgusting/creepy stuff that I pretend to not understand.

Also she keep ask me for money while, at the same time, she never ask my older brothers that live in her other house for FREE because ""they have a family to look after"". At first I accepted for ""helping family"" but now I start to feel mocked. My brothers (and their spouses) look the other way and pretend to not understand. The situation is even more fucked up but I needed to sum up.

I don't understand, why do I deserve this? I don't think I have made something bad.

This situation even change my perception of women. I would like to have a girlfriend but I have a bad perception of them right now. There was this very pretty girl that I was interested in at first but then I completely lost interest because of my mother's behavior. I don't even deserve a girl at this point. I feel stuck in a loop and I don't have the strength to break it.

I don't even trust anybody anymore and I have a very bad view of the world.

Sometimes I imagine to disappear from the world and I feel better. I don't want to exist anymore.

I think I have some sort of mental health issue because now I'm scared of take decisions. I don't have motivations anymore and I always feel inadequate. My parents never taught me how to deal with the world and always kept me under their influence. They are closed-minded and ignorant.

I feel empty, lonely and unmotivated. I don't know what to do and my life seems an endless nightmare. I need help but nobody will help me. I haven't a side of my life where I can feel safe (even my parents backstabbed me) and I'm sure I will end in a bad way.",14Oct2019,2
109,"Hello to anybody listening. I’m not sure where else to turn, I’ve got nobody to talk to and something told me to try here. I’m running on empty, beyond placing blame on any one thing or person. Every day is a miserable cycle of waking before dawn to drive almost an hour for a job that doesn’t even cover my basic living costs (food, utilities, etc.) I don’t think my rent could be much cheaper, around $650.  I work this job and then go home because it’s all I can realistically afford. I’ve been applying for jobs for roughly two years, something more sustainable and nothing seems to give. I’ve considered moving away, but I worry that I’d be in a worse spot given the cost of living elsewhere. I’ve reached out to job recruiters, sought out help forming a resume. I even let someone I know use this resume and they were complimented on how well crafted it is. So what gives?

I feel like I’ve lived my whole life trying to do the “right” thing. Was an honors high school student, completed a bachelors degree in computer science, and yet I’m left scrounging and essentially waiting for the next 5 months to pass before I’m out of resources completely. This state in life has exacerbated my depression issues, my self worth has gone down the gutter. Meanwhile I see so many around me have serendipity smile on them while I’m left wondering “why me”? My family has struggled with depression historically, so I know that’s one of my hurdles. I can’t afford healthcare, so I haven’t had therapy of any sort in a few years. I do take a mood supplement, I still feel horrible but it keeps suicidal thoughts at bay. At one point recently, my ex girlfriend suggested we get married to take advantage of her healthcare to get personal therapy for myself, and potential medication. That sounds good, I don’t want to feel this way anymore, but I’m so afraid that even doing that won’t improve things.

People don’t understand how soul crushing sex addiction can be, all the withdraw, PIED, views slowly changing. It is fucking horrible. I haven’t been able to fully feel emotions in almost 10 years. It’s a slow burn to fucking hell and everything I ask for help I get shutdown with “every 21 year old is a sex addict” or “sex addiction isn’t real” even though it’s tanked my life. No job, nothing I can’t function like this 

Let me make it very clear that I don’t want to kill myself. I don’t hate myself I fact I could say I love myself

But it feels like I’m being forced to do it. There is no help on the level I need. There’s minor therapy and things like that but almost none of those things help in the slightest

I’ve been shouldering on nicotine lately 
I’ve started to have heart murmurs
My teeth are starting to fall out 

Because of the stress of fighting the sex addiction for the last few years I’m slowly losing my sanity 

If my sex addiction doesn’t end, I’m going to die. I’ve used it to hide every single emotion I have had since I was 12. I don’t get better unless I stop acting out

Just looking for some support and a dialogue around something that’s been intensely difficult for me in my life. 

It’s Thanksgiving here and Canada and for me that signs a difficult time. I’m not going to flush out the whole novel of a description when it comes to my family relationship since I think that’d be counterproductive. Let’s just say that my relationship with my family is tense and the typical policy in my family is to pretend like nothing is going on so as to avoid difficult (and in my opinion necessary) conversations. I usually dread seeing my close and extended family because the odds are about 4:1 that I’m going to leave there feeling hurt and like an absolute shadow of myself until I process the emotions I feel are sluffed off on me when I visit. Can anyone relate to this? It’s a common thing so I’m sure a lot of you can. Can you tell me a bit about how you deal?

I’m not looking for advice, I’d just really like to have a dialogue and exploration as your equal about your story and it’s relationship to mine etc.

Thanks in advance, and if you are Canadian:

115,"Hi all, 

Myself [29F] and my younger siblings [25F, 22M] have had a pretty hectic life. If you wanna see it in detail I wrote a story about our dad [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/d2aolw/i_listened_to_my_dads_voicemail_today/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). The TLDR: our dad’s schizophrenic, he relentlessly abused drugs and he was very abusive to us, but mainly forced to witness it directed at our mum. It was very traumatic for everyone, we are still living with the aftermath even though we are all doing so much better after escaping that situation. 

I’ve had my fair share of mental health issues, but therapy and medication have helped tremendously. My mum is doing so much better without dad in her life, and my brother and sister are doing so much better too. My brother is concerning me with how much weed he’s smoking at the moment, but it’s the lesser of the evils. Other than that, he’s doing his best at life and I’m so proud of him. My sister on the other hand, is in severe denial about her alcohol addiction and the severity of her mental health. 

We don’t doubt she has some anxiety problems, but sometimes it comes across as shallow and like she’s playing a game for attention, and gets so angry if we don’t give her that attention. She has been caught out numerous times in weird and wonderful lies, and always has to be the centre of attention. She’s never been officially diagnosed, our old family doctor just suggested she may be exhibiting some symptoms considering our circumstances at the time. But she never wanted to go back there, which seems to go in line with other doctor visits she’s had. When they don’t tell her what she wants to hear, she goes to the next one. Unfortunately, we think she’s just after an easy fix like being prescribed Valium. But doctors here don’t just dish out these prescriptions because of how addictive it can be. And, our family is prone to addictive personalities on both sides. Apparently, she was given it at the hospital one night when she was having a panic attack. Now every time she thinks she’s having one, she says we need to take her to the hospital. But my mother and I both dealt with severe anxiety and panic attacks, so we are familiar with a lot of methods we learned in therapy. We try to help her but she just gets so angry with us like we don’t care enough to take her to hospital. These attacks she has do not need immediate medical attention. If they did, we would not hesitate for one second to take her there. 

When she has these attacks, it’s almost always the day after she’s drank a lot. She knows she gets like this the day after, but she still drinks to excess. She was even having shots of hard liquor at 6am in the morning as her “hair of the dog”. She’s very impulsive and will drink anything and does not know her limits. Just the other day, I went to her house to pick her up for a family event (she doesn’t have a license, I’ll get more into that soon). She was drinking cheap wine, it hadn’t even hit midday yet. It wasn’t going to be a drinking event either. She was sculling these glasses, but because I’m so conditioned to it I didn’t notice until she started venting about our cousin. She was going on and on about how mean he’s being to her lately, and I kept saying that’s really weird he’s never like that. After about an hour of venting about a night with him and his gf, she finally says: “Because he thinks I have a drinking problem. Everyone knows I’m not as bad I was when I left my ex.” And wow, did it hit me like a tonne of bricks when I watched her down the next few glasses of wine. 

With the license situation, she could of had her license years ago. But always blames us for not allowing her to drive with us to learn. But it’s because she spends all her money on alcohol that could go towards driving lessons, and is set on having anxiety every time she attempts to drive with us. We’ve tried to tell her that’s its normal to be nervous and frightened, especially when you have next to none experience with driving. It’s scary! I remember being damn scared too when I was 16! There is normal anxiety, and then there is the problem anxiety. But, no, we don’t understand. Mum actually still tries to encourage to drive with her, but she refuses. But at social events, she’ll tell everyone it’s our fault cause we don’t offer to help her learn. This is just one of many things she’ll blame on us in social settings, but whenever it’s just our immediate family, she’ll be automatically self-aware. 

Also with the driving, she expects us all to drop everything we’re doing to give her rides, and we are the worst people on earth if we ask for a little fuel money considering it’s more than a regular occurrence. If we don’t give her a ride, we get passive-aggressiveness and guilt-trips galore. For example, I was busy yesterday, god forbid, and my phone was on silent. I decided to look at my phone and had numerous missed calls and texts. The texts started off with the normal nice tone, and subtle guilt-trips, like “Can you please pick me up? I have no other rides :( I’m so frustrated :( xx“, but then, when I didn’t answer, it was a very blunt “Don’t worry. I’ll get a cab. I have food I need to get home.” Wow, did that send me into an internal irrational anger. I just don’t understand the entitlement. 

Other things that concern me is that she cannot be alone. Whether it be drinking with her friends or being in a relationship. For example, when her last, toxic, long term relationship ended, she was seeing someone that same week and then ditched him for her new relationship. I don’t remember a time when she was single, and if she was, she was still sleeping with someone. She’s also reckless and impulsive with sexual relationships. She’s even slept with people I’ve been with, and a numerous number of my (now ex) friends. She wears very revealing, inappropriate clothes at most functions and comes across as highly seductive and flirtatious at inappropriate times, especially if she’s been drinking. I actually get so irrationally worried leaving her alone with my boyfriend. By irrational, I mean I wholeheartedly trust my boyfriend and my sister regardless. So I don’t understand where this fear comes from. 

Now, she’s finally started therapy. I tried to mention in the nicest way possible to not skip over her alcohol problems, and self-medicating with over-the-counter pain relief (when she feels anxious) as these things are very important for the therapist to know and decide on the best course of action. I also said that this will take time (because I’m scared of her thinking it’s the easy fix again) so the therapist can get to know her and really help her. She seems so happy with her therapist after it, and even agreed she knows it’s going to take some time. I was so happy to hear her say that, and that she’s happy with her therapist already. 

This is the first therapist she’s seen, so I’m hopefully this is the one. I honestly think there’s more to her than just the anxiety she always exclaims. I love her so fucking much. She’s my baby sister and I just want her to get the right help and watch her flourish in life. I know something is wrong, whether it be alcohol or anxiety or something else. I just want the best possible outcome for her in this, and for her to be treated and diagnosed properly. I think this is just my extreme overprotectiveness coming out because of what we grew up with. I’m sorry if I come across as judgmental and cruel, but we (the family) all honestly feel the same way and are so confused and helpless in this situation. And we all hate to feel this way. Though, the therapist has been the light at the end of the tunnel. So we are all staying hopeful right now. 

If you got this far, thank you. I’m sorry if it’s a bit incoherent and all over the place. I think I just needed to write this all out and see if anyone else has had similar experiences with a loved one and that it all worked out in the end.",14Oct2019,1

Me and my GF met about 8 months ago and things have been relatively smooth the entire time. At least as smooth as it can be for the challenges that we face. She struggles quite badly with Borderline Personality Disorder and I try my best to help her and keep things stable so she can be happy, but it isn’t all in my control. 

I have read probably every article online I could find about BPD and watched many videos on YouTube to learn as much as I can about the disorder. The problem I have found with a lot of the articles is that they aren’t really catered to trying to help. Or at least they don’t give effective short-term advice. Many articles just talk about stability and getting outside help, but I am a broke college kid and she does go to therapy about once a month so more outside help isn’t really possible.

She has made claims to want to take her own life that I take very seriously and I make sure that she is always safe and nothing happens to her, but I can’t really reach out to her parents to talk to them about it because they are a key reason why she struggles with BPD in the first place.

So all in all what I am asking is how do I handle situations where she does have irrational desires to harm herself or participate in risky behavior and make her feel safe and loved and turn around the way she is feeling. Is there anything I am able to do? Or do I have to ride out the storm until its all calm again?

123,"Hey there, I'm new to Reddit (30 years old, male) and am not sure how things are done around here, but I just need to vent/share/talk about my story. If you can relate, or have something similar to share, please do! I am curious to learn if there are other people experience the same.

**Warning: Long story.**

So. PTSD. We will skip the cause of the trauma, and just move on to the after-birth I have to live with. Because, for the most part I have successfully dealt with the trauma. I mean, you never truly get over it, but it's not the nightmare it used to be. The worst part, is that it has left me with a discognitive disorder, severe derealization. It's always there, every second of every day, with peaks of pure terror. Which arguably has been a way worse experience than the trauma. And before you do: People ask me to explain to them what the experience is like, but after trying for over 12 years, I still do not know how. The thing is a bubble in my brain, that my mind keeps trying to dissolve, but is unable to. Even though I go through it constantly, I still do not understand it myself.

Anyway. It is absolutely terrifying. Like I said, it's always happening. I've not had a single minute of rest since it has started. However, after years living like this I've become more 'used' to it, and most of the time it's manageable, on a steady line so to speak. But the problem is, that it peaks. I call these 'episodes'. In these episodes I go through something that feels like my mind's being ripped apart, causing crippling fear. Sometimes the fear is so bad (very rare though), that I am unable to stand on my legs and I collapse. Once I've even gone temporarily blind, and deaf on an other occasion. It is horrible.

Needless to say, it has completely ruined my life. I can barely manage to work 20 hours a week, which causes me a lot of shame. I've lost most of my social life (I meet with people maybe once a month), and feel lonely and isolated because of this. I also haven't dated anyone in over 8 years. Connecting with people is seemingly impossible, since they simply do not/cannot understand, it feels like I live on a completely different planet. A lot of times this lack of understanding turns to people patronizing my suffering (""just get over yourself, go out and have fun""), which can be infuriating. Which is something most of you can relate to, I'm sure. A broken mind is not visible, such as a broken leg. And as probably a lot of you, I've become very good at hiding it. I can look someone in the eye while having an episode, and they'll be none the wiser, and they'll continue the conversation with me, while I feel like I'm dying.

Other than that I have a lot of trouble sleeping, I tend to over-eat causing me to be overweight, I have trouble with memory and remembering things, concentration is an issue, low energy and motivation, and who knows what else.

I've been on many different medications (Zyprexa, Risperdal, Seroquel, Venlafaxine, and whatelse), but nothing has worked. I mean, there were certain pills (opioids) that helped the peak episodes go away, but I was unable to keep taking them because they are highly addictive (it became a problem), they're not meant to be taken every day for 12 years. So I've been off meds for years now. I've also tried a lot of therapies and have even been committed to a psych-ward for 6 months. Nothing helped.

Over the years it **has** become 'better', with episodes becoming less frequent (from 50 times a day, to like 5-10 times), but I am confident I will live like this for the rest of my life. A constant state of fear, stress, exhaustion and loneliness.

We both want to get in a better place as far as our mental health goes before our son starts to notice and be directly affected by it. She is currently seeing a psychologist, has been for several months now. She doesn't seem to be making progress. More often than not she leaves her appointments raw and ruined for a few days after. I have been to a couple appointments with her because she seems to open up a little more with me there. The first time I came her psychologist said we found her source of trauma and could start to treat it. It's been a while and still no progress. We don't really know what to expect, though and aren't sure if it's just a 'gets worse before it gets better' situation.

She knows that all of this is a burden on our relationship, and I think we definitely need help there. My train of thought, though, is to solve her underlying anxiety issue before we try to tackle that. Anyway, I feel like we were almost forced into the psychologist she is currently with. I wanted to help her so I called several places and most weren't accepting new patients. One finally at least said that they just had a new psychologist start and he had availability. I can't help but feel like my wife isn't comfortable with him, but I don't know how much of that is just her not really wanting to open up to anyone at all.

I guess my question is should we stick with it or try to find someone else? If I want to find someone else for her where do I start?

I have PTSD, and I get triggered by loud, wooden noises, harsh winds, storms, etc. It was a tornado that happened about 2-3 years ago, I don’t really remember the exact date, obviously.

Also, I wanted somewhere I could keep everything in one place, from medication reminders to a food diary to just me generally venting, rather than having to juggle separate apps. So I decided to make my own. 

I have been talking in a private subreddit for the last few months with people with Anxiety, Depression, Fibromyalgia, CFS, MS, and other chronic conditions to try and make a mood and symptom journaling app that is effortless and intuitive to record into (especially given the brain fog that comes with many conditions), but still provides useful insights. The feedback I've received so far has been amazing and if all goes well the app will be released on apple and android in a few months! However I want to get feedback from as wide a range of individuals with different circumstances and needs as possible, so I’m posting here to ask if you have any feedback on the current state of the app in my video and whether you have any feature requests that you would like to see. You can find the video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okPITKLV0UU&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okPITKLV0UU&amp;feature=youtu.be)

144,"This is the first time I have ever posted something on reddit. And I hate how it’s because my mental health is so bad. A few years ago I went through this same feeling of just being overwhelmed and anxious that I almost committed suicide. I thought it would be easier than living and now I’m having the same feelings. 
Currently I live in a foreign country for work, but just recently quit and am moving back home to the states in the next few weeks. However moving itself is an overwhelming this. Also I don’t deal with change well, so I’m having this realization that I may never coming back to this country, and I definitely won’t be living here ever again. So I’m sad about that.
Furthermore. I’m dating someone who I rarely see and now really talk to. He works all the time and travels for his business, but as a result we are doing mostly LDR. However when he does go abroad I barely hear from him. 
So as I’m going through this stressful time and I want to talk to him about it, he’s not responding to any of my calls. Or he will respond hours later when I’m sleeping (time difference). So I can’t even talk to him. And because of this all I can help but this is that I’m being the obsessive crag one and it’s making me feel even worse. I feel alone and unsupported. And I don’t trust him because of my past experiences of being cheated on (not by him). There’s barely any communication between us so it’s hard to trust someone when I can’t talk to them when I need them. Like now. 

TLDR. I’m feeling super anxious and depressed with leaving where I have been living for the past 3 years to go back to my actually home. The change and moving is overwhelming and my boyfriend and I have very little communication while he’s away working. 

Ante advice or pick me ups? I don’t want to get back into the zone of suicidal thoughts again. Please help.",14Oct2019,6
145,"24f. I feel so sad and defeated today. My insurance is an absolute fucking joke (employer plan, covers NOTHING until I pay my $3000 deductible and even THEN I’m still responsible for 20% but I’m too broke to get a better plan) so I’ve been looking for alternatives to mental health treatment so I can *finally* deal with my anxiety and ADHD (and who knows, maybe I’ll get diagnosed with depression while they’re at it). My state recommended local health clinic for low cost/low income is crappy, far away, and the wait time is too long. I found this app Teladoc that sounded perfect as it’s only $3/month and for a virtual “visit” with a doc it’s only $45. I felt really hopeful and planned to schedule an appointment today when I got paid.

But I just got paid and found that I *still* can’t fucking afford it. How pathetic is that? I can’t scrape together $45 to tend to my mental health like I’ve been *desperate* to do for months. Because I need to catch up on late bills. And I can’t just let overdue bills sit and put this first, it makes my anxiety absolutely horrible. And I’ve been trying to claw my way out of debt and financial instability for almost two years now. I’m not going back in.

I’m about to just give up and force myself to just suck it up. I’ve done it long enough anyway. Fuck being so broke. Fuck the US healthcare system. Fuck the cost of mental health services. 

I just needed a vent. They don’t call it a vicious cycle for nothing. Ugh.",14Oct2019,4

148,"I’ve wondered about this for a few years now, but I’m not sure if I have valid reasons to question if I am bipolar or not. I’m female, 18, been on depression and ADD meds for 3-4 years and was on anxiety meds for a year or so when I was 15. I feel depressed pretty much constantly (always in the back of my mind), but there are definitely week-2 week periods where I’m noticeably less depressed than others for no reason. I’ll be very peppy and engaged with others, willing to go out with my friends (a rare occasion usually), bigger appetite, thoughts racing, higher self confidence, etc. My mom has been diagnosed with bipolar II since she was around my age, but her bipolar is much different than what I am experiencing (judging from what I’ve witnessed throughout my childhood). While I’m very irritable, I don’t scream and have the major random breakdowns that I’ve seen her have during manic episodes. I’m starting at a new psychiatrist this week, but I’m not sure if I should bring up this concern or not",14Oct2019,1
149,"So before I explain if you know me in real life, dont talk to me about this please, thx.

So within the past couple weeks I've been becoming closer and closer to the person I like. Eventually I asked her out and she said yes which sent my heart fluttering at 10,000 mph. The next day at around 2 am, she and i were talking and she ended up ending everything about it, wishing to remain friends, for which I'm grateful for. We broke up because she isnt the most emotionally stable currently, but I let her know that I'm here for her if she needs someone to talk to. We are still close friends but I cant stop thinking that I need to be there for her more and also i still want to date her, while also keeping her mentally healthy. What should I do?",14Oct2019,1
150," 

I (27M) have been dating this girl (27F) for 1 year now. Both of us love each other a lot. In the last one year we have never fought. We are compatible, complement each other really well, can't keep our hands off each other. ..the whole nine yards. She now wants to break up with me because she is suffering from anxiety &amp; needs some time off to fix it. 

Before dating me, she was dating her ex-boyfriend. They had been dating for 4 years &amp; wanted to get married. It came to a point where she had to either choose her family or him. She chose her family. We had known each other for 4-5 months up to that point &amp; had a crush on each other but couldn't make a move since she was already in a relationship. 1 month after her break up, we started dating.

She's told me about her anxiousness before &amp; so this isn't completely new to me. She says she doesn't feel very confident these days. Doesn't like being alone. She starts having negative thoughts whenever she is by herself. She feels like like she didn't completely heal from her previous relationship. In her own words - she's lost a part of herself. I asked her if she still loves her ex &amp; wants to go back to him. She says she doesn't &amp; I believe her. 

She's had this anxiousness for throughout the last one year since when we have been together. In the last 6 months, she put in a lot of effort to curb these negative thoughts, take one day at a time &amp; think optimistically. But that hasn't helped her. She says she hates that she can't be alone these days. She wants to be ok &amp; wants these negative thoughts to go away. She said she tried taking one day at a time but that didn't work. So, she wants to break up with me completely because she wants to spend some time alone &amp; heal from her previous relationship. She thinks that is the root cause of her anxiousness &amp; being alone will help us fix her anxiety. I told her that her reasoning doesn't add up - how will being alone help her? Shouldn't she have someone to help her through this. She said she feels like she depends a lot on me &amp; doesn't like that. She wants to be ok when she is by herself. She is also not sure if breaking up will help but for her mental sanity, she wants to try.

From talking to her, I sensed a bit of guilt in her. She really loves me &amp; feels guilty that I always have to be there for her or try to fix her. She thinks it isn't fair on me to deal with her issues. Also, if it doesn't work out in future she doesn't want to see me hurt. I believe some of this comes from her ex-boyfriend's reaction to their breakup. For at least 9 months after their break up he used to message her everyday with things like I still love you etc. And I have seen her personally get very upset on seeing those messages &amp; feel responsible for his breakdown &amp; probably doesn't want me to go down the same path.

I love her...so much. In an ideal world, we would be together &amp; happy. But even if we aren't together, I want her to be at peace. What can I do to help her? I have suggested that she see a therapist &amp; I am trying to push her to see someone. I am there for her. I am trying to understand her &amp; am standing by her like a rock. What else can I do?",14Oct2019,6
152,"I may be leaving soon. I have no confirmation of this, just vague synchronicities of my fellow inmates of CATC saying they’re getting discharged on such-and-such a date. Naturally, this means that I am going to be leaving any day now.

Even if I am wrong, my daily routine is almost exactly the same, so whether I am really departing my mental health inpatient stay a week or month from now, this diary entry will still hold true. As of right now, I have spent two weeks at CATC. This is following another two weeks at Unity, which was a much more traditional inpatient facility.

With over a month of tallys marking the days in my mental cell wall, this has been my longest inpatient stay by just over two weeks. This is my second stay in Oregon, with countless more stays in New York. The latter mostly wanted to kick me out as soon as possible, partially because my disdain of medication made me treat the emergency room as a revolving door, and partially because I used to be a mischievous, lying addict.

The fact that I sincerely want to continue this new cocktail of medications should speak volumes as to how far I’ve come since my early 20’s. Being a year away from my 30’s (God that makes me feel old) comes with a little more wisdom, and part of that has to do with making peace with the past, letting go of unhelpful habits, and stopping complete servitude to the aliens controlling my reality.

Being schizoaffective adds a number of fun loop-de-loops on the roller coaster that is my life. I checked myself into the emergency room at Good Samaritan on the basic of wanting to kill myself. I’m sure talking about serial killing during the intake process made them wary for a number of reasons, but the truth is I was a loose cannon ready to go off. I had been throwing myself in front of traffic, almost jumped off a bridge, and had been screaming at the top of my lungs at all hours of the day while homeless here in Portland.

Mental health has been a long-running battle of mine, having been originally diagnosed with schizophrenia for my drug induced hallucinations and brazen lying at the age of 20. Having little control of my life and being forced to live with my dad due to a lack of agency on my part, I sunk into a deep depression. It was only the unrivaled trust in the invisible blue aliens which create the synchronicities of my life combined with the help of a friend, a true angel in the darkness, that led to me learning to juggle.

Keeping a long story short, that was the crux of the reasons I wound up in Oregon to begin with. I knew I needed to get out of Syracuse. I was being harassed for starting to express my feminine side, regularly being called a “shim” in the process, and the synchronicities told me that I had a new life with my performance arts just waiting for me on the West Coast. 

I came with such high hopes, but regardless all my good intentions, my sex cult was not as fruitful as it should have been. Despite arriving by greyhound, it’s safe to say that I had a rough landing in Eugene. I chose the Emerald City city because it was the first place I lived on the west coast. Two years previous, I got a job writing for a nonprofit called Earth Nation. It turns out they were a cult. This is not to be confused with my own cult, The Secret Society of Shapeshifters, where we worship Satan and practice incestual beastiality.

Don’t worry, we only have sex with animals we are related to.

With memories of how free-thinking the population of Eugene was, I went to work on my performance arts routine right away. I didn’t have much else to worry about. There was plenty of food with conscious programs like the Burrito Brigade and others feeding the homeless. The entire tree-filled town radiated a positive vibe, as if it were still the sixties. 

The art that dominated building sides and sidewalks definitely told the story of a city that was full of love and compassion. Everything was colorful, and flowers could be found in planters all over downtown. There was even one bear statue which seemed to have been made for me, as it has a space just large enough for Peppermint, my pink penguin plushie.

At the bus stop, I received a ton of help from an older gentleman who told me about this and that service that was available, and pointed to a church where I got breakfast one Sunday and met someone with connections to the Manson family. We spoke about the possibility of ghost-writing his mother’s story, but I never got the chance to reach out to him.

On a different day, he told me that there was an improv group just a couple blocks away that helped people with disabilities integrate into the community. They apparently met every Saturday, but I was only able to attend one session. It was a load of fun seeing what other people would come up with for various prompts, and one woman recorded a completely unique sax solo there on the spot: one of a kind! Overall, it was an incredible activity for people of all abilities to come together and find common ground.

Being exhausted, my juggling and rapping were not on point, but it didn’t matter that I fumbled a bunch. My act went over great, getting tons of smiles from the crowd and giving me plenty of opportunities to make friends. One thing I have learned from my experiences is that networking is crucial while homeless. You never know who or what will give you a leg up. Keeping an open mind and staying positive is key to making it through to greener fields.

That was one of many reasons I’ve invested so much into performance art: it creates so many new avenues to approach people and start conversations. While some people may have thought that I was the new village idiot, I had some great successes in exploring self-expression and entertaining others starting on my first day. I didn’t have much of a plan in terms of what routine and where to set up, but that was the whole point. I would learn through experimentation and gain more than just experience: I would be growing myself.

Performance art is more than just a hobby for me. It saved my life. After what seemed like a lifetime living in isolation, my speech and social skills began to atrophy several years ago. Fear that everyone was a CIA agent prevented me from spending any real period of time outside my own bedroom. The world seemed like such an evil place: a reflection of the abuse I endured by my father. It was only through my rational grit to consciously recondition myself that I have been able to get this far.

Juggling gave me my first sense of identity, which then allowed me to build my confidence and try interacting with others again. I have always known that I was behind the eight-ball as far as my mental health was concerned. One such strategy I picked up while going out and juggling is to talk to myself, or the aliens, or Jane (the fictional AI at the NSA that hounds me day and night). I let go of the need to be perfect that I picked up from being raised by a narcissist and started acting crazy.

Hey, if I have to wear this label the doctor’s put on me, then I might as well go all out. How I haven’t been carted away by men in nice clean coats while in a straight jacket is a miracle to me!

Oh wait...

One of my favorite acts was doing magick. Outside the library, a stick became a magick wand that allowed me to easily interact with the muggles, witches, and wizards of Eugene. With a simple flowchart of how to respond to the ensuing yes or no answer from the person I approached, I was able to start practicing real charisma and filter interesting people from the people who would never understand me to begin with.

“Excuse me, do you know any magick spells?”

If yes:

“Wonderful! I was wondering if you knew one to help me meet open-minded people.”

If no:

“Would you like to learn a trick?”

And if they say yes, I go about doing my disappearing spell.

Taps head

Oh shucks, I seem to have forgotten it.

One event I won’t forget for a long time is the Whitaker Block Party. What originally started as a small block party had evolved over the years to an annual blast that swallowed an entire chunk of the city. The crowd was enormous, which didn’t bother me in the slightest because I was so excited to try out all sorts of new ways to play. I arrived early, and spent the first hour wandering around, taking everything in. Vendors were plastered all across several blocks. Even before the people came, I knew this was going to be a massive event, given how many portapotties there were.

As things heated up, I started juggling; first to music, and then to proselytize my cult. One of these was more successful than the other, but regardless I had a devilish time advertising with both Peppermint and Perry. Perry was our original leader, before I inherited his title of Almighty, Supreme, Legally-Greater-Than-God Megapope of Hyper-Divine Origin. Perry is also a platypus.

As I tired, I started phase two of interacting with the crowd. I had so much fun playfully hitting on the sea of people by asking where they got their kneecaps from. Those with unnatural hair color were clearly aliens; maybe they could hook me up with my extraterrestrial handlers who put that damned chip in my head that broke and won’t stop playing I Love Lucy repeats! 

This sort of charade lasted the rest of the day. I didn’t have any money, so I couldn’t enjoy any of the food that was sold there, but I did get a free watermelon slice. As dusk settled in, and I began running out of new people to talk about my kneecap collection with, I mosied over to a nearby house, where I had been invited to stay for hotdogs and music. There I sat, resting from a long day in the sun. The band was excellent, radiating psychedelic vibes as women painted the sidewalk with chalk drawings. If I had the chance to stay in Eugene longer, I would have certainly stumbled across a group of psychonauts who are also being guided by the aliens to destroy the Illuminati.

Alas, I had some difficulty staying at the Mission there. If I were to make a suggestion, it would be to get rid of the penis room. That’s the room where you have to get naked with men every night in order to stay there. Not exactly the most comfortable feeling when you have your own dysphoria to combat. When I first saw that, I had a moment of revulsion, then my paranoid mind kicked in and I kicked myself out before I caused a problem from an explosive episode.

I was making due with staying on the streets of Eugene. Then, for no apparent reason. I was run out of town! Maybe it had something to do with soliciting a man to lease his dog to our sex cult. Ok, it was because I was starting to cross some boundaries that I felt comfortable crossing, given how accepting I found the hometown of the Ducks to be compared to my own hometown. I couldn’t even talk about incest in Syracuse without the police talking to me to politely tell me to stop asking random people obscene questions.

Being perfectly honest, I don’t know what came over me that night. Even though I was doing everything right, I still had yet to make a single connection. A profound sense of inferiority and inadequacy consumed my mind, and I found my behavior bordering on sociopathic. I shoved a man and (presumably) his girlfriend, then had a field day coldly staring at him as he erupted in my face, unable to throw the first punch.

If I have to go on the stand, I will firmly state that I believe something was amiss that night. I can suspect psychotronic influence by the CIA, but obviously I will never be able to prove that. It wouldn’t be the first time they sabotaged me in such a manner. This is why positivity is so important amongst light workers. The evil forces of this world and others will take advantage of any darkness within you, turning you on your own head, making you your own worst enemy. The only solution is to conquer the ego, so that temptation cannot warp your reality as it did mine.

This has been a guiding principle here in CATC as well. With every day being the exact same, it can be easy to fall deep into a depression. There are many days where I don’t even want to get out of bed. But I manage with a positive mindset. With our minds as complex as they are, a single good thought can go a long way into sending us towards where we want to go. Which is why I am positive that I am leaving soon.",14Oct2019,0
153,"[20F usa) I have never been very in tune with my emotions. I used to think I never had them at all and was a borderline sociopath. Matter of fact if past me caught present me writing this post, i probably would’ve made fun of myself for being a baby. I grew up with some ‘unqualified’ parents, plus sized and ugly. But the thing is that’s never bothered me. I used to eat punches for breakfast, go to school and get made fun of, but I never cared. I wouldn’t cry, I wouldn’t feel sad, wasn’t depressed.  I knew that one day would be a good day and Most importantly I never needed the love or validation of another person. Until about a year ago. I fell madly in love with my best friend. We both attended this VERY small ( 63 kids in our grade) college and had the same group of friends. We dated and had one of those cliche relationships where everyone knew we were meant to be and quickly became the schools power couple. It was perfect. I have never felt so close or connected to a person in my life. It was like god made him just for me. We would have trivial arguments like couples do. But nothing major. Then one day we got in a fight over a homework assignment of all things and he broke up with me. Dragged me through the mud. It was ugly. I have never been done so dirty by someone in my entire life. And then I started to get sick. Currently I’m trying to get diagnosed with a chronic digestive problems that leave me nauseated on good days and completely incapacitated on the worst.  Because of the breakup, he turned all of my friends against me and basically bullied me out of the school. I now have to live back at home in a toxic environment. Now I just feel empty. I find my self desperate for love and support from people. I’ve got no one to give it to me. I haven’t been hugged in like 6 months. I didn’t think it was possible for my life to be picture perfect to one I’d rather not be alive for.  My life is a living hell. If Murphy’s law was a person it would be me. I know it sounds dramatic but every day is just filled with bullshit on top of bullshit I just can’t deal with anymore. If I didn’t suffer from anxiety attacks when thinking about or discussing death, I most certainly would’ve killed my self by now, I’m just too scared. I guess I’m asking what to do. I’ve seen a few therapists who, if anything, made the problem worse. I would tell them about what happens to me on a daily basis and they’d just kinda look at me and say nothing. Almost as if they didn’t know what to do either. I currently take sertraline (spelling?) as an anti-depressant. I’m really just looking for something or someone to make me happy again. The things I used to enjoy I don’t anymore. I want to get into new things and meet new people but it seems that it is just not feasible for me.

155,"I've had chronic, ""mild"" depression for most of my life. I am high functioning but completely miserable all the time. I go through the day faking absolutely everything. In reality I usually feel completely numb, hopeless, and like a giant fraud. I'm happy and engaged on the outside, but Eeyore on the inside. Sometimes my mood gets even worse for no discernable reason, but it always goes back to my baseline. When it gets even worse, I still function well, but it's more difficult and my hygiene/friendships are strained during this time. It becomes harder to focus on work and school because of brain fog. I still manage to get things done because I ""have to"", even though I want nothing more than to isolate myself and just sleep all the time. 


I usually have physical symptoms and sleep disturbances. It's hard to stay asleep, I awaken multiple times a night. Body pains occur that aren't due to being sick. Headaches, stomachaches and nausea. It obviously gets worse when my depression worsens, but it's nothing that I can't buck up and try to ignore. Blood tests and regular checkups show nothing is wrong. It seems worse when I wake up, likely due to poor sleep/nody stiffness. Some days, like today, the level of aches persists and makes it harder to really do things. 


Um, I know the irrational thoughts that come with depression. Nothing's really helped. I've been through CBT before but it hasn't helped. The various meds I've tried haven't helped - if anything, one of them made me even worse lol. Exercise helps done anything. Volunteering and work do get me out of my head, but it doesn't really permeate the fog of depression.


It's annoying because I've lost friends trying to talk about my depression. I don't just lay it all on them, because they have their own lives and concerns too. Also they're not equipped to help someone like me; it's not fair to expect that of them. Idk. I only have one person I can talk to about it. My family doesn't help nor do they even believe me, plus they have their own things to worry about. I just try to keep it to myself, aside from posting on reddit. It just gets unbearable and I feel like it's never going to end. I'm not sure what therapy can do - I don't feel anything but anger, anxiety, and numbness; I'm already functioning so that erases one of the main goals for therapy. 


I've just been thinking about trying therapy again through my workplace. Had an especially rough day and figured I should. Gotta do it while I can...soon the company will change and the option will likely not be available anymore, plus I'm going to be living somewhere in a few months where therapy and meds is simply not an option. 


As a last note, I guess I should mention that I often have urges to harm myself and I have passive suicidal ideation. I used to actually want to die but now it's more ""I don't want to live if this is what my life is, it's not going to end, I wish something would kill me and put me out of my misery"". Haven't done anything, but the fact that these issues are present and persistent indicate I ain't doing too great. I don't think I would do anything...but these issues also worsen when my depression gets worse. Guess it's a good thing I can acknowledge that it's the depression and ""ignore"" it - but sometimes it gets pretty hard to ignore and seems almost inviting. Of course I've never formulated a plan or anything like that, but sometimes it keeps me up at night. Meh.


All in all I'm not going to do anything. I'm just going to keep going thru the motions and ""live"" my life. I don't even know what therapy can do for someone like me.",14Oct2019,2

My grades tanked and the fact that I’m essentially wasting my parents’ money has been gnawing at me since sophomore year. I’m essentially depressed, with a shitload of work to do in all my classes and no will to do any of it.

Has anyone here ever been in a similar place?",14Oct2019,5
158,"Not sure where to start. Alt account for obvious reasons. Emotional atm so this might be scatterbrained.

So I've had major depressive disorder since I was a young child. Didn't fully realize it until I was professionally diagnosed a few years ago. I moved away from State A to State B to escape my mother, who was a toxic influence and had driven me to consider suicide on a regular basis. The depression stuck with me though, and for several years I had my ups and downs while struggling with it. The best state of mental health I've had in my life came when I found a significant other who was also struggling with mental health, and we helped each other through the rough spots.

That relationship ended maybe 3 years ago, and I've become increasingly nonfunctional since. I held my dream job for almost a year after the breakup, but eventually my old coping habits caught up to me and I stopped showing up for work. Since then I've relied on charity to live. At first from family, then from a friend of mine who is generous beyond all reason. But eventually the charity ran out, and I couldn't bring myself to ask anyone else for help.

I made efforts towards preparing to be homeless, but the more I looked into the logistics of surviving outdoors, the more I realized that if I couldn't force myself to be productive while I had a safe place to decompress, I wouldn't be able to with the increased stresses of homelessness either. I'd also looked into voluntary mental hospitals, but I didn't have the documentation, money, or willpower it would take to admit myself, and I was terrified of involuntary admission, because the feeling of being trapped triggers suicidal thoughts, and I'd likely find a way to accomplish it even in a protected environment.

So the viable options for me at that point were to give up and just start walking in a direction until starvation pains gave me the conviction to find a way to end it, or to do what I'd swore not to and move back to my mother's home in State A.

At that point I hadn't communicated with her in well over a year. Before that, when I did, I'd progressively be flooded with more overbearing emotional guilt than I could handle, so I stopped correspondence entirely for my own health. But she never stopped sending emails about how I should just come back to State A, and how it would be so much easier, and that I'd be surprised at how much she'd changed.

So a couple days before I was due to be homeless, I asked her to come get me, which she did.

At first I was in shock, having just fit my entire life in a few boxes and moving back to a place I'd known was a death sentence. But I was able to keep my masks up for a few days and not only coexist, but even briefly hold conversations with my mother. But once I was emotionally drained, the old problems started to surface.

The one thing I stressed to her was that I needed a place that was safe to retreat to, which wouldn't be invaded. But that was ignored on day 4 when she insisted on spending most of the day in the space to ""turn it into my room"". It already had a bed, which was more than I needed, and no matter how much I tried communicating that I really needed to be alone, and that I could do the work myself when I was feeling better, I was ignored with the general sentiment of ""I'm doing this for you,"" which was a running theme of the abuse before I moved out in the first place. I had several panic attacks that day. I'm familiar enough with them that I can be externally calm while I ride them out, with the only indicators being my skin going cold and pale.

Since then there were some days where the space was respected, but it felt like that was only because she didn't have a reason to want to barge in. More often were days where she would come in regardless of what I asked, eventually leading to me locking one of the doors to my room. This only made her angry, and she'd come in through the bathroom, which has its locks set up in such a way as to make it impossible for my room to actually be locked from the rest of the house. So I flipped the bathroom lock, which made her angrier, but after pounding on the doors and threatening to find one of the inner-door keys to unlock them, she gave up.

I don't know if I can explain what's going through my head that leads to the near-catatonic state I go into when I feel like my space is about to be invaded, but it's crippling. I shut down completely and freeze until whatever happens happens. When I was a kid, it eventually led to me being beaten with a belt while I was lying frozen in bed, because I wasn't responding and doing whatever it was my mom wanted done. And the lack of any reaction to the pain just made her frenzy worse.

Anyway, today, roughly two weeks after moving back in, after beating on the doors hard enough to shake the house, and screaming that she would kick them in, she went and found a key to unlock them with and came in to scream at me while I was lying in bed. Her dog was understandably confused and freaking out, and it kept jumping on and running over me on the bed while she screamed. I was having a panic attack internally, while waiting to be beaten, but something broke and I got up and yelled back at her to get out. When she wouldn't listen, I pushed her back out the door, which she'd managed to damage enough so that it wouldn't latch shut anymore.

So I stood there to block her from coming back in and we had a heated argument. She said I was violent, which I guess was true. I'm also male which makes it inexcusable to put my hands on a woman. That part I agree with and regret, but in my defense I have nearly zero muscle mass from years of malnourishment and no exercise, while she could literally pick me up and throw me across the room if she wanted.

I shut the door and pounded on it in the way she had, then asked her if that seemed violent or not. She said I couldn't stay here because I was going to put holes in the wall. (I have zero history of this. My dad did put a hole in a door or wall once. He was physically abusive and I'm assuming she was projecting that onto me.)

There were other things said, but it all basically boiled down to me telling her I wouldn't take the abuse anymore, and her telling me I wasn't welcome in the house. Now, knowing her history, this will likely blow over until the next similar event, until they get closer and closer together and eventually become a constant hell for both of us. 

So I'm back to square one. I can go be homeless until the depression kills me, or I can stay here until I have the conviction for suicide, which I have felt more strongly today than ever before. I had hoped that my mom would help me find a psychiatrist, but I'd forgotten how much of a stigma she carried against them.  I don't have the resources to admit myself to a mental hospital, and involuntary admission is just as much of a death knell as any of the other options.

To be entirely honest I don't even know what I'm expecting to come of this post. I have doubts there will be any suggestions I haven't already considered and found myself unable to act on for one reason or another. The main problem is that taking the steps towards getting help requires a level of willpower I just don't have access to anymore.

I just cant right now

&amp;#x200B;

Problem 1

im Ethan and I was born with cataracts in both my eyes .My parents went to a optemetrist to see if he could help .He recommended that he should do surgery on them to remove the cataracts ,He only did the surgery on one of my eyes and took the lens out.(This was when was around 2 years old.) of the other one saying that when i was older he would preform surgery on the other eye. 

I permanently were glasses now every single day ,Ive been doing so for my whole life. Im turning 16 on 22 December and im only realising now how fucked up this is now .We assume the surgery damaged one of my eyes since i cant see very far with it or read anything thats not huge even with my glasses and the other eye as I figured out today has never gotten that lens implant. My parents said that they went back to see the optometrist when i was a little bit older and he had passed away. Ive looked into the bates method which gave me hope .Most of that was extinguished today.

&amp;#x200B;

Problem 2 

Ive been mentoring one of my friends on self improvement and trying to help him live his life better I told him about what I learned from Dale Carnegie on socialising and introduced him to Nofap. We went on a outing yesterday my family, my friends family and the girl i have a crush on. He has no idea I like her and now Him and her are falling in love in front of my eyes. shit. then Today at school he thanked me sincerely for introducing him to Nofap and told me it had changed his life.  He mentioned that ive been looking sad lately and I cant tell him why ,he only wants to help me be happy but hes part of the reason im unhappy

161,"somewhat agoraphobic, very depressed, suicidal, panic disorder, PTSD


I've been struggling all my life, but especially since April. earlier this year before I had agoraphobic symptoms, I changed psychiatrists because the one I was seeing was trying to tell me how I felt instead of listening me and wanting to put me back on meds I've already been on. it took me 3 months to see someone new, I wanted someone with experience. finally I go the appointment to see new Dr and the receptionist made a mistake signing me in and I missed my appointment while waiting in the waiting room. well, if I got treated then, (April) maybe things wouldnt have taken a dive.

 I made another appointment, and was unable to make it due to my overwhelmedness increasing. after rescheduling, them refusing to treat me over the phone, I finally pull myself together and make an appointment. I ask for a medication that helped me before. Dr agrees. come back 2 weeks. new med helps! but barely. Dr increases dose. instantly fall backwards into overwhelming anxiety, clenching jaw, tightness in chest, too anxious to leave house etc. call Dr, stop high dose immediately. 

continue to struggle. can't go to stores. have panic attacks ~15 mins away from home. can't sit still at stoplights/anywhere. barely leave my bed I'm so depressed. wish I was dead everyday. next appointment rolls around and I can't make it. I fall between the cracks.

my psychiatrist leaves the clinic unknown to me. weeks after she's gone, im told and my therapist advised me to wait for the new hires. time passes. can barely get to therapy. struggling, just watching my life pass me by. 

well...last week, my meds run out and the clinic refuses to refill. they instantly refill the antidepressant that has serious withdrawals, but I'm not out of those yet, and they don't acknowledge the other medication I'm on because most ppl don't get side effects. (I'm guessing that's why they didn't refill it)

I called, no luck. called again...begged. called my family Dr. I just need a bridge. they say, ok make an appointment. phew! I really don't want to disrupt my medication while I'm not doing well at all. later in the day, family member goes to pick up meds and they refilled the wrong one. call Dr again, they have left for the weekend, but have admitted their mistake. I must wait until Monday. I call the psychiatrist ppl, they say the same thing, make an appointment and we'll bridge you. so I do but now they say oops there's no one here to write the prescription until Monday. 

that's the important gist, but I talked to so many people, so many rude people, ppl treating me like I'm milking for drugs, like I'm dramatic, etc. very unsympathetic. I cried all day. I only received someone nice when I finally broke and said ""ok then I'll just focus on not killing myself""

I didn't get my meds this weekend. today's day 4 off of that particular medication. I admit, I was very scared because I've had bad withdrawals before. on this exact medication. it wasn't so bad though, but I was very sensitive and just tried to sleep through it. family was unsupportive.

today is Monday. my face is plastered to my pillow. I have therapy to go to in 15 mins (yeah I'm not gonna make it, haven't even been in like a month...it's very hard to be there, or anywhere). I should be calling about the meds, even though it should be taken care of, I'm sure it hasn't been and I'd need to tell them to get the ball rolling again. I just ....

I don't want to call them anymore. I don't want to beg for treatment, for help. I NEED help and this place has really dropped the ball. I've fallen so far into the cracks by being compliant. I needed help, asked for help before things got bad and then they got worse than I expected and it's like I have to do cartwheels and flail to get any attention to my case. 

it's the hardest thing. I have no advocate. my case worker stopped talking to me after a disability lawyer told me he didn't want to waste his time on me because I was college educated and not drooling at the mouth. 

I've completely isolated myself and I'm getting worse. I want to die all the time. I cry everyday. I'm overwhelmed with everything. I want to switch clinics but ugh then I'd have to do an intake and start all over again explaining how I feel, who I am, and get put on the same meds again and again. I'm sick of being a guinne pig. I know I can get better, I just need help. I wish I had money to see doctors that truly wanted to help me ...I just have the state insurance. have had good insurance before...basically the same results. 

I want to die because I'm suffering. my mind is in agony. I don't really want to die but I want the agony to end.

163,"This is a rough subject, trigger warning for suicide. I do not want to inflict trauma from anyone reading this, but I am not sure of a more appropriate place to talk about this. Very long, and it gets sad. 

I went through the mental health system for years in my twenties, after my mom passed suddenly in my late teens. I didn't really deal with anything and found myself in a deep depression when I moved out on my own. After entering therapy I attempted to end my life a handful of times and was hospitalized a couple dozen times. After years of on and off meds, in and out of therapy, I settled into a more supported lifestyle with the help of a peer lead group center. After a few years there I was past any need for hospitalization and long off meds at my docs approval. Eventually the county decided I no longer qualified for therapy and was not in need of their mental health services. I am very grateful for the help I received, and I was able to stop being the self destructive confused person I was in my youth. 

That being said, I was still pretty unhealthy in my relationships with other people. I did too much for others and was codependant in some crazy behaviors. One of my worst decisions was to move in with my ex girlfriend. She and I were close friends before a brief dating stint, but she was openly obsessed with me, and she suffered from borderline personality disorder and other things as well. It was less than a month before she really flipped out. My boyfriend visited me, and she acted out. She destroyed my things in the apartment, threw all my just bought groceries in the dumpster and screamed at me, pulled my hair etc. Cops were called, and with no way to make her stop, I packed my things in my boyfriend's car and moved with him 4 hours away. I left behind what was one of my closest friends in my entire life, about half of my property and 3 months of rent that I could not get back from her. I was infuriated. She texted me pictures of my room she'd broken into, taunting me. She said it didn't matter if I came back because she will lock herself in the apartment and commit suicide, this time with a gun. I said the worst thing I've ever spoken/texted/probably even thought. I told her that I hoped she did kill herself. I even told K I hoped that I would find her, I was so very angry. 

I blocked her everywhere, her phone number, google numbers, emails, social medias. We had 1 friend in common on facebook, where I have never been super active. Fast forward over a year. I saw on her page that she ran in a fundraiser for suicide, and she had created a banner with K's face and information on it, including a death date. I began to shake. After talking with friend in messenger, I found out that she had indeed killed herself. I went to K's facebook page to find two posts, one where she had ordered a very specific type of substance that can kill you, and another where she had prepared the substance and was ready to take it. My heart broke. Then I found out the worst detail, because I never did come back, K was in the apartment for a month before she was found. I still can't wrap my brain around it. My friend told me nobody ever picked up her remains and there was no ceremony. Just this horrible fucking thing that happened.

I can't even really get into how I felt about all this, it was like a god damn lake behind a dam that I couldn't even crack. I moved on with my life, got some property to build a home and went back to school. I don't think about K much, but this week in my abnormal psych class, the topic is suicide. I read the word and I'm taken back to when I found out. I don't know what on earth I made this post for really, except that I need to tell someone about it. I don't think there's much others could say to change anything, but I have never shared the details of what went down with anyone. My boyfriend has a surface version of what happened, and he is not a person that can handle people being overly emotional or sad things. I guess I'm just looking for somewhere to let it out, to set down this heavy ass suitcase containing this tragedy and be able to talk about it normally. A big part of why this is so fucked is not many people cared for K, she tended to door slam friends and family, so it's not like I know anyone who can relate to how terrible it really is. My friend actually became overwhelmed with me asking questions about K over a year after her death, so I gave her some space.

Other people I have known took their lives since this happened, from high school and a few friends, but I was not as heavily affected. I've been considering the career path to certified counselor recently, but I'm highly doubting myself after this trigger has risen. Do I need to seek private therapy? Try to go back to county mental health services? I spoke to my doc very briefly about feeling depressed, but I'm not near needing medication. Thank you anyone who read all this.",14Oct2019,4

Yesterday afternoon I came forward to my youth group and talked to them about it, and I'm planning on talking to my parents either tonight or tomorrow night.  


I'm anxious about telling my family due to my Mom being the overbearing, overprotective, helicopter type (who treats me like a baby) and she's likely to freak out and worry even more...

166,"I’m sorry that this ended up being so long. For whoever actually reads it, thank you for at least spending the time to do so. 

He dumped me. I’m too emotionally unstable because of my anxiety and he doesn’t know how to deal with me anymore. He’s sticking around until the end of our lease and helping out financially because he feels “obligated” to my two teens to not completely implode their lives simply because we didn’t work out. I’m devastated. It’s been 8 years. I’ve never felt this level of love, connection, and devotion to someone and he’s thrown it all away because I’m not mentally healthy. 

I don’t want to be a financial obligation. I just want to be loved and supported. I don’t want to lose him, I don’t care about the stupid money. I don’t know to get past this. I haven’t been sleeping or eating. My kids are noticing that I’m not okay and I can’t even keep my head on straight when I’m at work anymore. It’s been 4 days and I feel like my world has ended and I’ll never recover. 

I made an appointment through the assistance program at work. Thankfully, that’ll be soon, on Thursday. But I don’t even know what to say. I’m broken. I feel stupid for being the cause of his unhappiness. I hate that I caused him any pain. I don’t want to lose him but he’s clearly better off without me if I make him feel so uncomfortable in his own home. Other than my kids, who are almost ready to move out anyway, I feel like I don’t have a purpose in life anymore. My whole life has been geared toward being a doting wife and mother and I couldn’t even make it to alter with him before he ran from my crazy. If I’ll never be able to manage a healthy relationship, and my kids are leaving the nest... what is my life? 

I honestly don’t know what I’m asking for here, but I moved out of state, away from everything I’ve ever known so he could take a job offer. My closest family is 3 hours away and I don’t talk to the rest of my family because they’re abusive and I can’t handle it. I have no friends. No support system. I’m lost and now I’m broken and on top of everything else, I have to depend on him financially knowing it’s my fault for causing this situation and even now he’s still there to make sure my kids are ok. 

I don’t know what to do or even where to turn to.  I’ve already made all the normal calls. I can’t qualify for any financial or housing assistance while he’s still living with us, I have a counseling appointment this Thursday, my son saw his counselor today, and I’ve already requested for my daughter to see a counselor as well. I’m going through the motions like I’m supposed to but I just feel like an aimless robot. I was also just in the hospital this past Friday due to chest pains, and that freaked my kids out, so I’ve been keeping my symptoms to myself since then.  I’m trying to be strong for my kids but I’m a mess and I’m having a hard time holding it together.

I got different suggestions here for cheaper alternatives to mental health services which were: an app for telemedicine “Teladoc”, or to visit my local health clinic recommended by my state for low income.

So I tried the app. It’s $3/month but they said any doctor “visit” is just $45. I thought great, I can swing that if I plan ahead.

So I got the money together, I go on the app and request to talk to a Psychiatrist because I want to be evaluated and possibly diagnosed for anxiety and adult ADHD. Welp, before I could talk to anyone, i was then told it would be $200.

On a normal basis I try to replace the word with what I *really* mean: something is bizarre, confusing, ridiculous, or absurd, etc. But there have been times where I have genuinely struggled to come up with what I mean besides something is ""crazy.""

And that's where ""a bunch of bananas"" comes in. For no particular reason, we started using an array of banana-specific desserts (banana pudding, banana creme pie, banana muffins, etc) as a silly way to replace the word ""crazy"" and then we hit on ""what a bunch of bananas!"" and the amount of times that we have used it in the last few weeks is ridiculous but it just **works** for some reason.

But when the depression comes I STILL cannot see a way out. 
I can't see that it will pass. 
I can't ""distance myself"" from it. 
Despite the fact that the episodes pass, time after time.

 I have suffered consequences when I contact people for a listening ear during these episodes. I've told myself over and over 

Do. 
Not. 

contact anyone for help, just wait it out. Reason being, that shortly after the episode begins, its over, and I'm left feeling ashamed and humiliated by what I've shared about the low points. 

It tarnishes peoples opinions of me. 
It makes me not credible. 
It causes people to mistake me for a lunatic all the way around and paint me with one brush. 

I AM NOT CRAZY OR DANGEROUS. 
I am not unstable as a whole. 
I have mood swings. 
But people can't see that. 
They judge and back away. 

I have lost much by sharing during my low points. But I feel so desperate for help.... And my impulse control sucks so I keep doing it and jeopardizing my reputation.

What is the answer??? 
I don't have ""safe people"" to get support from during these times. Just because they're relatively short
 (a few hours to a week or two)
 doesn't mean that they're not real. 
And I have no perception of them passing (when I'm in them.)

The self hatred is DEEP. The CONSTANT 
suspicion that I'm secretly disliked by my friends, that they just put up with me and are maintaining a friendship out of pity and also fear that I will lose my mind if they tell me the truth or back away totally. The (verified fact) 😔 that my parents hate me for no reason 

I trust noone. 

Reason is that as a child I was given double messages. 

1) I love you, I'm proud of you, you're wonderful and
2) you're terrible and so much so that I'm going to beat the shit out of you,never apologize and then deny it later. 

So... I naturally don't trust people when they say they like me. 
Always suspicious. 

And surprise, I attract people who mimic my family (invalidating feelings, giving double messages, telling me I'm the problem ) and that fuels the further destabilizing of my sense of self.

Do most people live every day with a voice in their head analyzing everything,

 WORRYING INCESSANTLY, 

telling them they're unlovable, thoughts constantly whirring and self hatred in the background (like elevator music with variable volume, but always audible?) 

Or am I alone in this? 

Sometimes when I'm in public or stopped at a traffic light I have the urge to scream into the air asking 

""AM I THE ONLY ONE SCRATCHING MY WAY THROUGH ALMOST EVERY MOMENT?  HOW ARE YOU PEOPLE DOING This!!!!???? WALKING AROUND WITH YOUR STARBUCKS AND A HALF SMILE? 
DON'T YOU WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE?"" 

and then.... Chimes ring...... 

and I'm smiling, enjoying my music as I  drive, detached from outcomes, enjoying the moment, creating something, making people laugh, exercising, working with a smile on my face, feeling the love of God, not needing a THING to be different, grateful THEN... 

Brrrrrring chimes ring again and I am inspired to do something new, buzzing with excitement, SO SURE that this thing is IT, is meant to  be, is my true path..... Brrrrrring....

no more motivation. 
Zero. 
Self doubt and the old suspicion that I'm worthless and got sidetracked by a ""new idea"" which was actually just a mechanism of DENIAL, a stupid idea to distract me from my feeling of worthlessness. 

A hair brained scheme I was foolish to believe in. But I believed it.
 I believed I was meant to start this new venture, this relationship, this creative idea... I REALLY believed it.😥

Falling flat and directly into the void of heart wrenching, body aching desperate loneliness and CRIPPLING self doubt under a heavy blanket of meaninglessness.... Brrrrrring, 

The cycle continues and I comfort myself now and again with suicidal ideation. Immersed in various fantasies of dying. 
Comforted by suicide dreams... 

Something ""the others"" just gasp at, horrified, unable to understand the logic. 
Unable to understand that the fantasies of slipping quietly out of this dimension do not mean I'm actually suicidal. 

And then there's you know, holding a steady job, attending university, grocery shopping, helping others aka ""being a completely normal and high functioning member of society"" 

Let me tell you something. 

The day I meet a Man 

(the capital M was on purpose) 

who can spill his guts full of dreams, failures, insecurities, suspicions, fantasies and some monotonous shit  all mixed up together, is the day I have met my soulmate. 

cause I am a 
mixed bag of Prozac and spirulina. 
A wounded genius. 
A crazy sane person. 
An utter mess but clean and sober. 
A raging, loving, persevering human, spiritual, heart centered, misaligned, well intentioned, soft n shapely, sincere, ME. 

I'm all of it. And FUCK ME it's tough.

175,"In the evening, when I'm supposed to sleep. I can't. I'm either having a mental breakdown because I had an hour of free time because of school, a mental breakdown because I had an abusive father who only used me to bait money out of my mother and her family, or I'm having another mental breakdown because of a step-father who never says something nice to me, and complains about everything I do 24/7.

Because of my stepfather, home never truly feels like home. School is my home, with friends who accept and respect me. The only one who does at home is my mother, and sometimes my siblings. (The sibling are also a problem. I have 4 of them, so I am never truly alone, I never have 100% privacy.) But school has changed this year, I have so much homework that I can barely rest, and the time that I have to rest, I have to spend with my stepfather. So my one hour of thinking and talking to myself in bed is the only true peace I have. But more than the half of the time this only makes me more depressed, because of the mental breakdowns and cringe worthy thoughts of the past. Some of the thought are how I never had true happiness and a childhood, and some are that my stepfather also never loved me, just like my real dad.

I have no one to talk to about this, (because I live in a small village, everybody I know gossips way too much, so everybody would have dirt on my family) And it is a great burden on my mental health. Please help. Give me advice or words of hope, I don't care, I just need motivation to keep fighting and be a better (and healthier) me.",14Oct2019,2

177,"So two things have happened in the past two weeks that have kind of spooked me. Ill give a little background of my mental status and then go into the events, then end with a question.

I have ADHD and suffer from hypomania, Bi-polar and schizophrenia run in my genes. Lately I have been under a huge amount of stress due to school( I take IB, so if u know u know) and my anxiety has been through the roof and I usually have hypertension but lately it has been very very bad. 

The first thing that happened that made me kind of worried was the hallucination. It started out with my parents going off to vacation for two weeks, right before they left I started my couch hopping journey for the next two and a half weeks. I couldn't stay at home due to us living 1 and a half hours away from my school and I'm dependent on my mom and stepdad for transportation. A week after they left I came back and had to pick up some things, and when I went into my room I saw that my closet was cleaned. This was very very weird as it is a mess and I hide some teenager things in there (stuff I would really rather not have my mom seeing) mostly just an embarrassing amount of trash but also beer cans and liquor bottles and also snus(A nordic nicotine thing) that I having gotten rid of from when I had some friends over. So my conclusion was that my mom had cleaned it out. I decided that I wouldn't confront my mom on what was in there. But here is the twist, two weeks after they had returned I was cleaning my room and I went into the closet to get a broom and to my utter surprise the closet was exactly as dirty as before my mom had cleaned it. So what this means is that my mom never cleaned my room and I had hallucinated the whole thing....

Ok seriously while writing this, I have completely forgot what the other thing was, which is super fucking weird because I almost had a panic attack when this happened. Seriously don't know what the fuck is going on with my memory. Once I remember ill edit the post. The fact that I forgot it is just making me more worried.

Seeing it in my head filled me with so much frustration. I don't know what this is.

You know what also doesn't help? The feeling of everything not being so real anymore. Maybe it's because my glasses aren't on but even if they were, I still get so lost staring at nothing. The pixels in the air are moving again.

I have a severe problem with zoning out, spacing out whatever you'll call it. I was diagnosed a few months ago with GAD and been patiently waiting, but now the moment the day comes when it's my 20 or 40(?) minute therapy appointment, I'll literally jump at them. I don't care, I need to vent.

I can't stand waiting another month. It's barely October, my appointments not 'till November 20 something. I'm so tired. I'm not depressed or anything. I'm losing myelf. I'm only, well recently, turned 12..

The Dr didn't even read the damn referral which explained why I was there. And I known this bc he didn't come prepared with the documents he needed for said evaluation.

And you know what I got?? All I got was FUCKING PRINT OUTS of a .com website explaining to me what I've been diagnosed with for YEARS 

Also! He just kept bringing up how horrible Trump is, Which I'm not a big fan of, but regardless is so not something to talk about during an interaction such as that.

It was such an unprofessional interaction in which I come in vulnerable and asking for help.

Don't get me wrong there are some benefits to handouts, but I was very vulnerable in that office and I had came in prepared with my paperwork, early to the appointment, and had been upfront and honest with everything, and I walked away feeling so unsupported.

I left feeling (and still feel) more broken and that I will never feel better again. Just feelings of depression and defeat. I cried and cried and cried. I'm so frustrated with the mental health care (un)available to me... And Im literally suffering from it.

So I've (24F) been through the ringer a bit in regards to various mental illnesses in my life due to shitty people being shitty (major depression, derealization disorder, GAD) but I have come through most of them with the help of my lovely fiancé. However, my physical health is in decline, which in itself is bringing on major health anxiety. Everything just seems to be going wrong in my body and I'm having to wait months for appointments to rheumatology/pain clinic as I'm in the UK

One of the big things is a sharp pain in my chest that will not subside. I have had a 24 hour ECG which came back normal so nothing heart related, but I still worry that they could have got it wrong. I also get general pains and feel nauseous every day.

This is taking a huge toll on the mental health I've worked so hard on to improve. I'm anxious, depressed, and just fed up of it all. I'm generally someone with strength and positivity but this is getting too much. Any tips on how to deal with it?

I'm trying mindfulness and relaxation techniques at the moment, and I am considering therapy again. last time it was person-centred therapy which got a lot off my chest but there was not enough guidance for me. Any advice on which therapys are good for this stuff is also greatly appreciated.

I just want to be able to put my health to the back of my mind and get on living my life like I used to. I used to be able to enjoy my life for what it was even though I was sick and see the joy in the fatigued bed days. The pain really doesn't both me that much if it's not accompanied by  awful thoughts and anxiousness about the future.

I also worry about medical staff taking me seriously as they are all too quick to label literally anything as 'just anxiety' (even when I was feeling better).

I need advice ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

So, as you can read the title, I'm definitely failing spanish lol.
Lemme give you a bit of me to understand how I'm failing. I'm a autistic, bipolar, depressed teen that has no reason to live but I'm still here so might as well try and get through it. I don't try with my classes because honestly I would rather draw and die :p. All I really do in school in partly listen and draw the whole time. I do freak out about my grades and try to get them up to not disappoint my parents but lack motivation.  I draw a lot cause I'm bored. And being bored is boring (my weird logic).

Anyway so yeah I don't do much in class. I just want to talk to my friends and not worry about everything bad (which is basically my whole life). And because of that my grades have gone down. Now I want to explain the spanish thing.

I do online spanish because last year's spainsh teacher just talked about god and how he ""lead me here to teach"". The online course has this time limit to complete tests and I've taken advantage of that. I have not done a single test until its about to end. I somewhat regret that haha (plz kill meh ;-;). There are these modules that go module 1, module 2, module 3, etc. etc. And there is this exam on module 1. Hahaha and I didn't do it. So two weeks ago they closed module 1 and started module 2. That means they locked all the tests on that module. The problem is...module 2 needs you to complete the exam to start tests on module 2 :P.

I emailed the teacher, and after a series of emails, all I got back was-

""You're f*cked you useless b*tch lol""

Thats not exactly what she said but that's basically it. I been thinking about transferring out, but it's a highschool credit, and my parents wont allow it. I refuse myself to tell them, cuz I hate myself getting into this and I feel like they're be SUPER disappointed in me. I've been thinking about just yeeting myself into the afterlife (so much easier) but I'm trying to not do that \ (•◡•) /.

For the first couple of months even though we worked together we never talked, and I did not notice her at all. Once we got to talking and I relized that she is great, and we slowly become good friends. Jinx and I had a couple of mutual friends and we used to hangout together a lot. I later shifted to another project in the company and after a month or so, luckily she ends up in the same project as well. At our location we were the only two people in that project with our managers in another state all together, and thus we were together the entire day at the office. Eventually I fall for her and told her about it (She had an on and off relationship with another guy at that time), and we continue being friends.

Over the course of two years we keep working together and turn out to be very good friends, but I was still in love with her and could not move on at all. Sadly because even though I tried I had to see her at work every single day. She went on to have other relationships with other guys and went on a couple of Tinder dates from time to time. We never end up together even though I tried hard.

After almost two years of meeting her and infatuating over this girl, I get an opportunity to move to another country, and I instantly grab it with the hopes that maybe a couple of thousand miles will help me move on. Its been 1 and a half years since then, I have unfollowed her on all social media platform, deleted her contact, removed all her photographs from my phone, stopped calling her, blocked her, and I am still unable to get over her

He is easily distracted, plays lots of video games, smokes weed etc. He has bipolar, depression, anxiety, and possibly ADHD; he has been hospitalized once for hallucinating/being too manic after his psychiatrist put him on meds that caused psychosis. I've never seen him in that state, he is very gentle towards me, but has some trauma associated with his hospitalization and a distrust of mental health care. It took a toll recently when he dropped out of his phd, became homeless to go camping/ski, and I had to basically help care for him for 6 months, encouraging to find a job (which he recently did). I also have depression and a back injury that has left me feeling like a second priority. It came to a head when I explained all of this, and he seemed so detached and out of it while I cried and shook in hysterics, feeling like he wasn't processing my words. I said, ""I don't get how you can't understand unless you're a sociopath."" He then said, ""maybe."" I was shocked. We broke up and then spoke again later as he kept messaging me. After much probing, he said he usually feels numb/nothing at all.   


He is sad that he doesn't feel much and he wants to, and has had moments where he feels high emotion but it's rare. When he does feel, he is crushed by the amount he has hurt me/taken me for granted. He said he might have sociopathic tendencies despite no desire to hurt anyone (physically, or emotionally). He begged me not to view him as the sociopath self and said he was always a caring kid and that when the feelings come back, he has clarity and feels bad. But in the moment when I was crying, he said he felt almost nothing, except bad for not feeling anything even though he knows he has put himself first. He said he wants to be able to support me but can't do so if he can't support himself. He is now scheduling an appt. with a therapist, says he wants to stay with me, and that there are moments of clarity when he feels strongly for me and said he will regret losing me when he has full clarity. He said it is scary to not be able to feel and asked me to be understanding, but I'm pretty terrified. Empathy has always been my #1 priority, and yet he has almost none, and I'm running thin on putting all my energy into someone who is admitting he can't give back despite supposedly wanting to.  


Should I cut my losses and move on? I feel scared that he felt nothing when I cried; but I have also seen him when he has emotion (his ""true self"" he says) yet it is rare and leaves me longing for more?

My moods have been crazy. I am generally upbeat and always ready to go. I'm always moving lately I don't do anything I enjoy. 

I told my kids a few weeks ago about my anxiety. In the simplest way I could. My oldest son came up to before and hugged me out of nowhere. When I hugged him back, he hugged tighter. He knew I needed it. 

He said. ""It's okay Dad. I know you're not feeling good lately. You're a very good Dad and I'm proud of you. You are trying your best and like you tell me. We cant always be right, or strong or feel okay. What's important is that we fall down, take time to let the hurt go away and then get back up.""

So recently for a couple months I've noticed my thoughts kinda have their own conversation with each other.

I can never remember the conversations afterwards though, and it's not constant,it just happens sometimes. When I notice it though I'm always tuned in trying to get in on the conversation whilst thinking to myself this is weird what's going on. Especially since I can't stop the conversation

I wouldn't say I ""hear voices"" though because i can't hear it... It's in my head. It's like when you think to yourself inside. Except I can't control it and it's multiple thoughts talking to each other. I hope this makes some sense...

212,"I have alot to say and honestly, I simply want to have a conversation with someone outside of my actual life because everyone I am close to makes it extremely painful to even think let alone relax. I feel like talking to anyone will result in some kind of damage ... As it has done before. DM me if you have time to spare, if you also need to vent, make a new friend or just by curiosity :')",14Oct2019,2
213,"I’ve noticed some patterns in my romantic relationship that include me feeling emotionally disconnected from my partner, questioning their devotion to me, as well as questioning my own devotion to them. These take place daily, especially during days spent apart. 

As a result, I feel like I am running in circles and I have no idea if I’m in a dead relationship that’s not for me, or if I am creating that idea in my head. Everything he does ticks me off, but rationally these things should not, and do not bother me so much when anyone else does them.

Anyone else? How do I stop it?",14Oct2019,1
214,"It’s like people are too lazy to meditate. Are they too lazy? All it takes it 30 minutes or I do 1 hour or more it’s more effective if you do more than 30 minutes like more than 1 hour. This is ridiculous people say all this bad stuff happened to them. And they go to therapy for 10 years and take meds and then they still have all that sadness and anxiety. When In reality you can just meditate and spend 1 week meditating and then all that depression and anxiety will be gone forever that’s all it takes people are lazy they need to do there research on meditation and all the stuff it can cure here is a website that tells you all the mental problems it can cure 

https://eocinstitute.org/meditation/141-benefits-of-meditation/

All you have to do is lay down on your back put you hands to your side and let your body go heavy and eventually you won’t be able to feel your body and try not to think but keep yourself from falling asleep listen to everything around you and then eventually if your meditation goes well you will go into a unconscious sleep state between sleep fullness and wakefulness and it will feel like you lost time and we’re not able to think stop doing therapy that you have been doing 10 years for and stop taking your meds you don’t need them you need to meditate not trying to be mean about all this but there is a simple way to just cure your problems it’s called meditation",14Oct2019,0
215,"My story

I am currently 23 years old and have been on psychiatric meds since I was 13. I need help sorting through my mental health and my medications. Most recently my doctor has prescribed SUNOSI 75mg but I am pretty hopeless that it will work. 

At 13 I was diagnosed with depressive disorder and given a standard SSRI (low dose). Since then, it has been an ever losing battle. 

In college, I was started on Adderall for the first time, to help with “ADD/inattentive” 

After college, I began experiencing excessive sleepiness. 
- I could, and do, sleep 12 hours a night
- I ignore basic responsibilities such as phone calls, emails, texts
- I am unable to have an intellectual and emotional conversation with my husband
- Caffeine has no effect on me
- I am missing out on activities, outings, events, because of this. 

I have taken every medication known to man. Literally. 
* Adderall
* Adderall XR
* bupropion
* Concerta
* gabapentin
* lexapro
* metadate
* Methylphenidate
* prazosin
* propranolol
* prozac
* rexulti
* Ritalin
* sertraline
* Strattera
* topiramate
* trintellix
* Vyvanse
* Vaylar

I am an inpatient oncology RN, I work 12 hour shifts. On work days I will wake up at 5, get to work at 630, work until 730/8, and get home at nine. I am married. I have two dogs. And am passing through life. Not living it. 

My current regimen. 
AM
- 100 mg lamotrigine 
- 600 mg NAC
- A prenatal vitamin
Around 10 AM
- 400 mg modafinil
- 50 mg mydayis
PM
- 100 mg lamotrigine
- 100 mg fluvoxamine
- Zyrtec 
WEEKLY
- trulicity


Some days, I will take 87.5 mg of mydayis and still fall asleep. 

Help me, what am I doing wrong? Do I need to spread out my meds more? Am I just a loss cause? 

My labs have all come back normal, except I have extremely low testosterone and extremely high sex globulin binding hormone. 

My sleep doctor prescribed me with “mild CSA” I have and use a CPAP

I have been diagnosed with OSA, GAD, MDD, ADD/inattentive, OCD, Hypersomnia, etc",14Oct2019,5
216,"I have fallen down the hole just over a year ago of not having any motivation, saying ""what's the point"", and succumbing to anxiety. Now I feel like if I talk to anyone about what I feel they'll say I'm just lazy or trying to get on the depression bandwagon since it seems like everyone has it nowadays, and not to mention that apparently 18 yo males aren't supposed to have emotions. I guess what I'm asking is what should I do to get out of being stuck between wanting to help myself and also being trapped under the blanket of anxiety and social constructs, I'm sick of feeling helpless.",14Oct2019,1
218,"I'm highschool age, male, and probably gay, if that helps anything. 

Why am I so reclusive and antisocial unless I'm with my friend? I spend a lot of time with him but he can't always be with me, we're still young and live with our parents. When I'm with him, it's like I'm a whole different person. A much better person. I can talk to my dad easily, I'm almost never locked away in my room, I joke around and hang out and am generally just social and very, very happy.

When he's not around, it's like a switch flips. I get quiet. I stay in my room and sleep, my conversations with my dad are dry and forced. I don't eat much. I'm usually sad but I suppose it seems worse from the outside. My dad's asked me to cut it out and honestly I don't know how, because I don't even know why I'm acting this way. Does anyone know why this is or how I can try to fix it? It's almost as if my happiness doesn't care much for anyone but him.",14Oct2019,1
