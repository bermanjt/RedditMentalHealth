0,"I‚Äôm almost 18, but not yet. My mental health has recently taken a nosedive because of family issues and problems. I did some research and found out that my local clinic offers mental health services. However, my father pays my insurance and my aunt works at the clinic. Is there any way to prevent them from knowing? My father is a huge cause of my depressing thoughts and I‚Äôd rather him not know. I live in California, United States.",06Jul2019,1

3,"I'm at a loss. I don't know what to do and even if I drink or cry it doesn't go away completely. I feel like deep down, something is missing. The first time I've felt this way was when I was around 14 years old and it was a low point in my life. But I thought I'd outgrow it, but now I'm 20 and I'm still the same. I'm the same child with the same stupid thing inside of me I can't even name. 

I'm sad and I'm crying because of the pain that lies ahead of me. But I don't know how I can deal with life when it's painful and I'm going to suffer anyways. I don't know how people deal with pain. How do you do it? How do you deal with it? How do you keep on living, knowing that living means suffering? Cause I don't know where to put this. I block it out but when it's time to confront the pain, it's too much. It feels like a hole in my chest. 

Sorry if this does not make any sense.",06Jul2019,1
4,"I‚Äôm sure this is a common thing but because I live with my family I am kind of afraid to cry. I just get really embarrassed and then without realizing, I force myself to stop crying. Then there‚Äôs a well of emotions in me that I‚Äôm trying to keep down. I end up feeling worse. I enjoy crying but there‚Äôs nowhere for me to do it. Idk, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm inherently embarrassed by crying in front of all people but most people. I don‚Äôt mind people who are there for me and try to cheer me up but don‚Äôt pry or become overprotective and way too sweet. Those people annoy me and that‚Äôs how my family is. Maybe that sounds mean to complain about but it really does make me feel awful. I feel like I can‚Äôt go to them for help or they‚Äôll start treating me like I‚Äôm a kid until they get fed up and tell me to just ‚Äústop worrying so much‚Äù. I‚Äôm pissed off now but whatever. I need to move out.",06Jul2019,2
5,"I dont even know how long I've been doing this for but my older brother mentioned how he would see me ""fidgeting and internally panicking"", that I would grab my earbuds and start increasing the volume to a random playlist and hum along

Not necessarily random, he claims its always a James Arthur playlist

Am I the only one though? Like, I consider the base of the music and their voices calming but........not that calming",06Jul2019,7
6,"I have undiagnosed adhd in the past, which hindered my learning ability. I could read books for hours,and watch cartoons for hours. However, i could go to a maths lesson and learn division and not know anything when i came back. She denies the adhd. On the flip side, when she acknowledges it, she will say that I will be unable to hold down a job, due to poor executive functioning. I realised my mum's toxicity permeates every aspect of my life. She keeps telling me I'm fat and that I better lose weight. She tells me I have a thick waist and tells me to wear straight, blocky clothing to hide my waist. Whenever I go for interviews ,she will dictate what dress to wear, ie. this one is too short, that makes you look fat etc.  Everytime I went out, she demanded to know who I went out with,who are my friends etc.  Now she's telling me that mass comm graduates can't find jobs, how they need to be v sociable and yadda yadda, and how,everyone can write n speak. She says that even a social butterfly like her can't do mass communications. Also, she can shit on everyone for their skills, abilities, like saying how she is better at baking  than her classmates, ie. those who showed interest in baking, as compared to her, who showed zero interest in baking. ""Its true, really."" She does not acknowledge her flaws at all, and when she acts contrite, and says ""sorry"", it is always in a patronising and condescending manner. She shits on my grandpa, my dad, everyone in the world etc. Yet the church says that I must honour my parents. I find it hard to do. Like, the church said if I showed that I have transformed, they will be likely to come to church and yadda yadda etc. Lately, my pdoc has been asking my mum how I have been doing at home, and she's like, ""I don't know"". When he talks about medication and preferences, she says ""I don't know"". In the past she used to play the role of the good mother, and say ""oh, she's fine"", and agree with the pdoc about everything to a ""T"", like ""she's intolerant"",""blatantly honest etc."" I haven't achieved financial independence yet, and my dad's the sole breadwinner, so I can't move out. Can't go to transitional housing/step down facilities unless they sort of disown me. No rehab homes will take me in unless my parents disown me.",06Jul2019,1
7,"A quick overview of my situation: I'm 17, have been suffering from depression, anxiety and self harm for five years. Self harm has escalated to the point where I've required sutures on multiple occasions. Been on Setraline and Fluoextine. Currently under CAMHS. 

CAMHS would like me to begin IPT-A for 12 weeks with one session per week alongside me taking Fluoextine. I can't really find much info about IPT-A so I'd like to ask if anyone here has been through it themselves, if they found it to be effective, the positives and neatives, etc. I'm quite apprehensive about it all because I am so nervous and terrible at talking with people about my mental health and life. In all honestly, I feel hopeless about trying but I don't want to upset my mum any further, so I'm trying my best for her (when I went to A&amp;E for stitches they wouldn't let me go home unless I allowed them to tell my mum.)

So, has anyone experienced IPT-A, and if so, what was it like?",06Jul2019,1
8,"I‚Äôm 13 turning 14 this year.  I don‚Äôt think I have depression (I don‚Äôt know i‚Äôve never talked to anyone about it) but I want to kill my self 4/7 days a week if not more. it‚Äôs not because of anyone at school... it‚Äôs because of my family. I can‚Äôt deal with them anymore and just writing this hurts me and I can‚Äôt go more into depth, i‚Äôve recently relapsed back into self harm and i‚Äôm contemplating just getting suicide over with. I want to just die.

9,"I posted here earlier but I am going to repost with more detail to help get better advice. To start it all began when I was around 10 or 11 and my cousin maybe 2-3. I honestly can‚Äôt remember. This happened one 1 occasion that I can remember, I can‚Äôt even remember if the second one happened. I somewhat humped my cousin. It was not like full on thrusting but somewhat like humping for maybe 2-3 minutes. I never touched him or made him touch me inappropriately and both of us always had clothes on. I forgot all about these childish acts until today. My cousin is a strange child and acts very strange at times. My mother tonight at dinner suggested that he may have been sexually assaulted. She has no evidence of this claim besides that his other cousin that is much closer to his age is somewhat violent and almost got kicked out of elementary school and has an alcoholic mother. I then remembered what happened 6-8 years ago. I did not mean harm to him during the act but I cant help but think somehow this is my fault. I have such a good relationship with my entire family including my aunt and I can‚Äôt imagine how they would look at me if they knew. Was this sexual abuse? Do you think these acts could have caused his behavior today. Could he even remember these things. Should I tell my mother about what I did. I don‚Äôt know how to feel.",06Jul2019,1
10,"As of this month, I‚Äôve (24F) made it a goal of mine to take hold of my anxiety (situational and social) and my depression (clinical and situational) that I‚Äôve struggled with since I was ten-years-old. I also was diagnosed with PTSD, due to medical trauma and a toxic, very abusive ex boyfriend whom I dated two years ago, so that is something I‚Äôm working through with my therapist, too. 

With that time in therapy, I‚Äôve learned ways to cope in moments of anxiety: breathing techniques (i.e: 5 things I hear, 4 things I smell, 3 things I see, 2 things I feel/can touch, and 1 thing I ‚Äútaste‚Äù - typically I say the air lol) and ways to get my mind off certain things that trigger either my depression or anxiety, even both. I‚Äôm in the process of learning more about meditation (it‚Äôs not something that comes easy tbh) and other forms of reduction of mental trauma. 

Yet, I‚Äôd like to know more ways to cope and to heal my mindset. 

My desire is to date again but my goal is to care for myself before I do that. I‚Äôm not bringing all this...trauma into a relationship because that isn‚Äôt fair, to me and my partner, or at least that‚Äôs what my therapist told me. 

Anyway, thank you in advance ‚ò∫Ô∏è",06Jul2019,2
11,"I've thought about this for a long time but something happened last night that made me finally say something. I just need to yet it off my chest. So last night I was driving home at 12 so it was very far, and I was driving on a back road in the country. So I was driving with my brights on cause no one was around then I saw head lights so I turned my brights off and who ever was in that truck made me so happy by extending the same respect and courtesy. I was so happy and I wanted to share my happiness with someone but I knew if I said anything it would come off as weird and they just wouldn't understand.

 So I'm writing this as maybe like a wake up call, I gave no idea but it helps to say it. I feel like I get this way because of how little people are close to me and the slew of mental problems I've got. Plus the problems at home. I don't know it just helps to talk and get it off my chest. Any messages are welcome :)",06Jul2019,6
12,"I wasn‚Äôt allowed to drive because I was a threat to myself and others when I would get into this headspace. I‚Äôm cleared now but every time I drive I have to blast music or a podcast because I‚Äôll go back to those bad thoughts and then it‚Äôs headlights off, speeding, sharp turns, numb but screeching tires. At work it‚Äôs the same, when I get into the routine for the day I go back to my thoughts and then it‚Äôs wow, every dark shadow in the world. I have to drug myself with my epilepsy meds to sleep because if I stay awake the thoughts will come back and then I won‚Äôt just take enough to put me to sleep I‚Äôll take enough to go farther.",06Jul2019,2
13,"Mostly just a rant. Apologies. I‚Äôve noticed this sentiment turns up a lot on this sub but I really don‚Äôt expect anyone to read this

I just feel very indifferent towards everything. I‚Äôve gotten relatively impressive awards for my paintings at the state level (I‚Äôm in HS) and some minor stuff at national level, but for both of those I wasn‚Äôt really particularly happy about it. I wasn‚Äôt even that happy when I got into the art program that I‚Äôm in now even though it‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever wanted. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm upset or self sabotaging, or even that I don‚Äôt care. I just have difficulty summoning any strong emotion about it?

I don‚Äôt feel emotionless though, I made some really good friends at my school who I genuinely enjoy hanging out with. I feel bad for it but I feel more emotionally ‚Äúinvested‚Äù in these friends than I do with my family. I love them, of course, and have no reason to be indifferent towards them. But I don‚Äôt have the energy to watch hours of movies or shows with them. I guess that‚Äôs more of an ‚ÄòOwO I‚Äôm teenage rebelling‚Äô type thing but I have never felt rebellious, or if I am, I disagree with the notion that spending a little less time with my family is a rebellion

I haven‚Äôt cried since January. Don‚Äôt know when or why I started keeping track but whatever. Really the strongest emotion I‚Äôve had in a while is my frustration towards myself and when I‚Äôm talking to my friends. I feel like I can be happy in the moment, but after the fact I am numb. Sounds so emo lol. School is out for summer and I just want something to do, since I‚Äôm really only happy in the short term. Never thought I‚Äôd miss school this much but ever since I realized it would end soon my apathy got way worse

I‚Äôve talked to my therapist about it but she doesn‚Äôt seem too worried. Sort of scared me since it means I‚Äôm either not conveying how bad it is properly, or it‚Äôs actually not bad at all and I‚Äôm overreacting. I hope it‚Äôs the former because I would love the validation of knowing that something is up because it sure feels like there is",06Jul2019,1

15,"Was gonna put this on r/BPD but everyone 'splits' randomly and just send negative vibes. I'm not sure if this is necessarily 'fear' of abandonment but well, I am fucking mad right now. Kinda shit because I tend to internalise. But when it comes down to it, there is no one that would really care for me. I'm fucking angry as shit and don't know what to do, I would drink but I can't, I wanted to kill myself but I made a promise to my mum I wouldn't after a close relative did after taking a certain drug (don't worry about it) what should I do",06Jul2019,1
16,"This happens when my thoughts are roaming, usually during menial tasks, and I think about something I regret doing.  The words that come out are usually along the lines of ""stupid f#$&amp;ing idiot"", ""Piece of s#%"" or something to that effect.  What's unusual about this is that I don't seem to have much control over it.  When it happens it just happens without any prior intention of doing so, however, it's not debilitating and the physical manifestation is not completely uncontrollable.   If it's in a social setting I can keep the words to a whisper and try to cover it up with a cough or  but a physical reaction always happens whether I want it to or not.  When I suppress it I end up grinding my teeth really bad.  I'm probably just cringing which is obviously normal, but it doesn't feel normal.  This has been a noticeable thing since I was a teenager and I'm 37 now.  Am I just overreacting about this?",06Jul2019,3
17,"I‚Äôve been dealing with a lot of issues with friends during the past about 6 months. I decided after months of depression episodes and constant crying to cut them off. It‚Äôs been about 2 months and I really feel like I have no one anymore. Like I have so friends to care for me and it‚Äôs been draining me. I have no clue what to do anymore. I‚Äôve slowly been trying to find someone, anyone I could maybe get as a friend but it always ends the same. We aren‚Äôt close and won‚Äôt be, they already have close friends. I just feel like as you grow up in school, especially in high school that it‚Äôs hard to start over and find all new friends. I just feel like giving up and just dealing with the loneliness. I think about it everyday and I really don‚Äôt have a solution, but there doesn‚Äôt seem to be one. If anyone does respond to this, I am in therapy but it really isn‚Äôt helping with these feelings. I just feel like I can‚Äôt move on, I always think I have moved on from those friends I left but then I start to regain all these feelings again. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I wouldn‚Äôt go back to them, they were horrible to me and I didn‚Äôt deserve to be ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with a bunch of people who didn‚Äôt want me there at hangouts and would talk badly about me behind my back. I just feel lost because every time I get into friendships the same thing happens, they get tired of me and just treat me like I‚Äôm garbage. I‚Äôm not perfect but I don‚Äôt feel like people should be treated like that especially if they were my close friends who I told everything and would even come to about my mental health. That was a lot of trust that was ripped away from me. Idk, I just feel stuck and my depression is just getting worse. I just hope I don‚Äôt feel like this for all of summer",06Jul2019,4

This is an academic post, looking for participants (Australian Men, 18 Years+) for a 4th Year Thesis Project, examining men's expectations and engagement in psychological therapy. 

Australian men, what do you think happens in psychological therapy? We‚Äôre looking for men to complete our online survey and answer a few questions about your mood, aspects of your personality and your expectations about therapy. Findings will help to improve understanding of why many men do not seek support for mental health issues.

We are looking for men, living in Australia and 18 years-of-age or older, to complete a 10-15 minute survey. Participation is completely voluntary and anonymous. If you would like to contribute to this important area of knowledge, simply follow the link below. Thank you.

Whenever I feel loved by someone or get excited to talk to them, my chest swells up and feels like a thousand little cotton balls are being jammed in there, but in a good way. Like I'm being pumped up like a balloon. But when they don't respond with the same enthusiasm I have or respond the way I expect them to, my stomach sinks deep into my pelvis and suddenly I tense up all of my upper body muscles and it just feels like those few seconds of when you take a scooper to the inside of a pumpkin and just keep scraping, except it feels like that forever. I feel it deep inside my chest. It's like a pang, but it doesn't make my chest feel full, it feels like things are being taken out, rather.

I keep trying to find the answer online but I'm not really getting anything. 

Whenever I feel detached I get really numb and I just feel, no other way to describe it but ""cold"" my entire body feels cold and I feel isolated. It's the only word I can use. Just freezing cold. And whenever people make me feel good, for some reason the only words I can ever think to use are ""warm"". The cotton balls in my chest make me swell, they make me feel warm, and whenever it's taken away from me I just feel ice cold.

Is this a sensory thing working in tandem with my autism and anxiety?",06Jul2019,2
21,"Today I was at PacSun and they had bins of clothes $5.99 and up BOGO free. I found a shirt I liked for $9.99 but no other ones. I went up to the counter to pay and the cashier said I should get another one since they were BOGO. I told him I couldn‚Äôt find anything but I‚Äôll look again. I found a shirt that was $9.99 but I didn‚Äôt like it. I figured I‚Äôd give it to my sis but then I seen a little girl and thought it‚Äôd be nice to give it to her instead because my sis has like double the clothing as me. I asked the little girls mom if it was okay and the cashier gave the little girl the extra shirt I didn‚Äôt want. They were talking about how nice I was when I was leaving. 

Here‚Äôs the thing. I‚Äôm not nice. I try and try but not really try honestly it just comes to me to do nice things. I don‚Äôt even think of them as nice until someone tells me it is. My boyfriend always tells me I‚Äôm nice and sweet and really caring towards others. 

But no matter how many acts of goodness I do I can never be a good person. I have done so many bad things no amount of good things can erase those bad things I‚Äôve done. I‚Äôve cheated. I‚Äôve stolen. I‚Äôve talked bad about people and I have done one thing I am absolutely not proud of and will never forget.

It‚Äôs been a few years since all of that but I will forever in my mind think I‚Äôm a POS. I try to do good wherever I go but it‚Äôs not enough to get rid of this feeling. Maybe I don‚Äôt deserve it.

I‚Äôm almost certain that it‚Äôs not a thinking problem, I‚Äôm not depressed over my life, job, relationship, finances, current situation, or anything like that. I‚Äôm usually a pretty happy go lucky kid, but for some reason the last couple of months I‚Äôve just not been feeling 100% and feeling down. Some days are better than others and sometimes it gets real bad that I almost get into a panic attack and I just wanna go lay down. I get this maybe once a week and doesn‚Äôt seem to have any trigger. Any insight or advice? I‚Äôd prefer not to go into my doctor yet because if I do then I have to report that for my job and that will basically end my career. I‚Äôve tried vitamin d supplements, those haven‚Äôt worked.

26,"For months or weeks I hardly noticed but I kept noticing things that made be a tiny bit scared of dying. I dont want to talk too much about the details because my mental state feels very ""fragile"" and my thoughts could spiral very quickly. Almost a week ago, one night it all fell apart. I had some bad fear the day before, but this night im pretty sure I had a mini panic attack. The next day I felt fine for maybe 5 seconds after I woke up and then I started feeling anxiety again. Not as bad but there. Then it varied throughout the day and I had to stop a lot of things. Im 16 so im off for summer but I just stopped a big cleaning project i was doing, like i couldnt do it because i didnt like who i was working with and felt like i was wasting my time. Starting yesterday ita hard to do anythinf like cuddle with my cat because I cant stop thinking everything is temporary and cant seem to wrap my head around how much time I have anymore. It feels like its all going to end very soon. When the fear gets really bad(which happened a couple times in the past almost week) it almost feels like fingers are running down the back of my neck. It just all happened so suddenly and I havent felt normal for more than MAYBE a couple seconds each day and i cant even remember if it was normal. I just wanna feel normal and enjoy the long time i have left. But it feels like so many things are just triggering the fear and it all happened so fast. I can't live like this and idk what to do.

27,"In recent years I have been dealing with a lot of social issues. I guess it all started when I started high school. I feel like none of my friends are genuine to me and I feel lonely all the time with my only escape being Xbox with my friends I have online.

I used to hang out with my friends all the time and never worried about the integrity in my bonds with people but now I'm not so sure that I have any real friends. It's not like I'm not trying to do things with my friends but it seems like no one cares about me because it's like I only have friends when people have to be around me (school basically). I try to invite a friend or two on several occasions but they always have excuses to not do anything or just don't respond to me. I will sometimes go to large events with lots of friends but Everytime I try to involve myself I just get sort of pushed to the side. My parents don't know my struggles and they think everything is okay but they aren't very supportive do if I told them nothing would change. I don't know if there is something wrong with me that deters anyone from being around me but what I do know is that I hate this feeling of loneliness.

I think I just need help figuring out what is so wrong with me that even my ""friends"" don't like me. I also fell very insecure about my physical self too so maybe that is involved. Any advice helps. Thanks",06Jul2019,1

32,"Hey Reddit, I hope I'm posting this in the right place!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm struggling right now, and I'm not sure if its mental illness, social ineptitude, or something else altogether, so I'm reaching out in hopes someone can figure this out. I'm sorry about the wall of text but PLEASE read the whole thing. I'm terrible at talking about myself and I'm sorry about that but I'll try my best.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't had a stable mind since I was maybe 12 (around 20 now), I feel like I have trouble connecting with people and, the friendships I do make, I burn down when I'm having issues.

&amp;#x200B;

So, a little bit of background on me:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm one of several sons, my parents are both Christians with conservative views. Their relationship was rocky ever since they got married but, obviously, I didn't know about that until I was 16 or so. The first 10 years of my life feels like they were relatively normal. I wasn't abused by my parents, we got scared when dad was mad obviously because he spanked hard and would get mad and break stuff, but it wasn't more then a bad temper. I had a bad experience when I was little with a guy supervising me at church but it wasn't bad so I didn't give it much thought. 

&amp;#x200B;

For some reason dad's always hated my older brother while mom loved him. My younger brother reminded him of himself so he was his favorite. When I was 10 and my younger brother was 7, we started knocking heads and, for some reason, mom and dad just turned on me. Throughout my teenaged years I was screamed at a lot, they'd tell me I was worthless, a failure, disrespectful etc. They said I deserved to die and they biblically had authority to kill me for disrespecting them when I was arguing because of some Old Testament verse. They rarely got physical, never more then the occasional shove or hit.

&amp;#x200B;

We moved to a new area when I was 7 or 8, and it turned out to be one of those closed-off little towns in the midwest. We suddenly couldn't make any friends. I was homeschooled the entire time, so there was no way to get away from home. Our chance to leave the house was a family trip to town where we'd get yelled at the entire time and get in trouble for everything. I only got to do stuff with other people my age about once a month at homeschool events, which were always parent supervised.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I had several years where I was in a bad place mentally. I thought I'd mostly beat it (because of a friend I've made, I kinda have one foot in the house and one foot out), but as of late I've been having issues again. I'm never invited to do anything outside of church events and that one friend of mine. I know plenty of people but most people don't seem to want anything to do with me. On the occasion that I start to get close to someone I have a bad night, I vent to them about stuff, and they pull back super quick and avoid me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what to do and its killing me. I used to blame myself and it nearly destroyed me, but now I'm just getting mad at other people and I'm scared I'll snap and take it out on someone else or something. One minute I'll feel relaxed, sitting alone in my car listening to music, the next I'll be super angry since I'm almost always alone, then I'll start feeling depressed and hate myself. I don't let that get too far though because if I go down that road again I'm not gonna win.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really not sure what to do guys. I'm posting this here because I need help and I don't really have any other places to go. My parents are against me, my relationship with my siblings aren't great, and basically no one wants to have anything to do with me. If I'm toxic I want to fix it but I'm also trying not to remove myself. If anyone can help I'm happy to pm and talk more. Someone please help.",06Jul2019,1

34,"Ooookay.

Having axed my chances of succeeding in life by about 75% on top of how already low they are...

I am now faced with the extreme fear of encountering a therapist who doesn't understand what anhedonia is, why it makes everything meaningless, why I can still feel mostly negative emotions but not positive ones etc...

What are, please, the magic keywords to conveying this reality to a specilist?

I lost my job, my relationship bombed. I had no hope before this happened and with this condition, I can't fix anything and hearing ""You need to keep hope"" makes me want to SCREAM and tear heads off. I don't care, I'm worthless, WHY stick around? I've felt lkke this since childhood but somehow, the divorce and ""recent trauma"" are all the therapists want to discuss.

I NEED TO FIX THE ROOT CAUSE, GUYS. not address the symptoms anymore. I want to care, but the reality is I am incapable of feeling care. I don't even care about my friends other than in an intellectual capacity, according to one (who's known me for about ten years). I never noticed but she's right.

So. The end of the rope is near. Before I go there...... anyone managed to get some ACTUAL help regarding anhedonia?

I think I made the worst possible scenario happen when I was terrified of exactly that. Life isn't livable without the ability to feel hope, actual love, care, giving a true damn, happiness.... it's always been hell on earth and it's gotta stop.",06Jul2019,2

TL;DR: Looked up creepy shit on the internet and ruined the entire horror genre for myself right as I was getting into it, and I'm sad.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\* Possible trigger warning for those with PTSD or aversion to really creepy things. I don't go into heavy detail. \*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I've been a video gamer for as long as I can remember. Last summer, I took my first true foray into horror, and it was fun and exciting. I played Silent Hill, Resident Evil 7, and Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. I sincerely enjoyed all of them and have no reason to believe any of them had any permanent negative effect on me. There was one time when I had to take a break from Silent Hill for a day, but that was it. Other than that, I never had any trouble sleeping, never felt like I was in true danger, never felt like these games were impacting my life in any way outside of playing them. In other words, a completely healthy relationship to have with entertainment media. Aside from games, I really enjoyed darker-toned stories in general, especially graphic novels. Stuff that really stayed with me emotionally and dealt with deep topics in an uncensored (though not gratuitous) way.

I should mention here that I've also had a longstanding emotional separation between what's real and what's not. Playing video games with violence was rarely an issue for me (Call of Duty campaigns = great fun), and at this point scary video games were mostly okay, because they were safely in the realm of fiction. The idea of seeing horrible real-life footage, though, was always something I was uncomfortable with. If it involved a real person, in real-life situations, I was very unsettled by it. I'm guessing this is pretty normal - intense situations are fun as long as they're not real, right?

Late last year (December) I made a terrible mistake. At one point, I couldn't sleep and was like ""I wanna look up creepy stuff!"" and did so for a little while. It affected me in a negative way for a few days, but I recovered alright. A few weeks later, during a bout of deep depression and low self-worth, I went on YouTube and looked up creepy/disturbing video compilations, effectively binging for two hours while at a friend's apartment, despite that little voice in the back of my head telling me not to. My reaction to it was extreme. I felt the ""presence"" of the people in these videos everywhere I went, even in my apartment which previously felt completely safe. I was in a constant state of panic and had images flashing through my head every time I closed my eyes. It was so bad I was having thoughts of suicide, got about 10 hours of sleep in four days, and called off work one time because I was so tired. It took a good month before I felt comfortable and safe in a dark room again and wasn't obsessively thinking about these things. This was from me seeing stuff that was pretty PG-13 but thinking about all the other terrible stuff out there.

It's been seven months since then and I still have not recovered fully, and I'm working on accepting that I may never achieve a complete recovery. I have recovered partially - I recently experimented with watching videos about horror games on YouTube, and none of them have had a serious effect on me, to the extent that I actually felt very positive after watching some and feeling fine. I've worked on reminding myself that any disturbing or violent videos are in the past and not actual events I have gone through. (I kind of consider that stuff porn for the fear response.) But I feel like I can't experience safe fictional horror the same way any more, and that really upsets me, as it was a genre I was just starting to really get into. Even the darker stuff that I used to love feels a little unsafe. The last graphic novel I read before this happened was about World War I, and it was definitely R-rated in a violent way, yet my reaction to it was completely fine and safe. Nowadays I'd be scared or very cautious about reading it.

I've always been intrigued by the weird and unknown, and it's caused me some issues in the past. Earlier in my life I read quite a lot about aliens, ghosts, and unidentified animals. The problem was that I had a similar response to the one I'm experiencing now, though thankfully not permanent. But there were times in my youth when I was terrified of turning away from the wall when in bed, or even opening my eyes, for fear that something would be in my room (as illogical as that is, and nowadays knowing all of this is just thoughts in my head). Thankfully, I recovered fully from all of that.

I think the above directly relates to why I ""wanted"" to look these things up. I write it as ""wanted"" because it was that weird mix of not really wanting to see disturbing things but at the same time being morbidly curious and wanting to understand it. I think the desire for being affected emotionally plays into it as well. I've always liked media and stories that evoke a deep emotional response and really stay with me (To The Moon anyone?), so I'd guess the very enjoyable dip into scary games was related to that.

I feel like I've gone from low/safe sensitivity to high/unsafe sensitivity with the exact same content. I used to be excited about scary/dark stories, now I'm this weird mixture of excited yet not wanting to experience it. I don't just feel the emotions from whatever safe, fictional content I'm looking at - I'm being reminded of all the real-life horrors out there, and that ruins the experience for me. It's like I'm experiencing safe horror with a backdrop of real-life horror, rather than *just* the fictional stuff.

For the time being, I'm taking a break from the heavy content and have been playing a pair of limited-violence, non-horror games, and staying away from most media over a PG-13 level. I do have a therapist who I have talked to about all of this and it's helping a bit, and my partial recovery does give me hope. One day at a time, right? But please, share thoughts on this, and if you have any questions, ask away.",06Jul2019,1
45,"Honestly I had a relatively nice time in-patient. The worst part for me was the snoring! Such weird sleeping sounds. Try to bring better earplugs than the ones they give you. Also cherry chapstick. It will keep your lips hydrated and give you a tiny red tint. Also use the chamomile tea they give you and soak your hair and body in the tea. This is calming I swear it. I would even advise pulling the leaves out and rubbing them on your skin. During your time outside make sure to sit in the sun. Do yoga, meditate and whatever music they give you is a gift!

My parents tell me to suck it up when i'm depressed, and i just end up feeling worse. They aren't even like this, they are just like this with me. They support my sisters when they are distressed, but not me.

It's not like i can take this. I have Asperger, and depression, and this makes it a real struggle for me to get anywhere in life. I'm an emotionally weak person, and i'm enduring emotional pain that i cannot deal with.

This is nothing new either. I always got bullied as a kid in every social environment i was in, and ended up being treated like a social outcast, or like a punching bag, or the joke of the class.

47,"I never actually claim I have OCD, but I have also never gotten an answer to... whatever this is. I've mentioned this to a few close friends before but ever since I was little (maybe 6-7 years old) I have had the irrational fear that I am being watched through cameras regardless of whether they exist or not. I know there are no cameras in the vents on the ceiling or hidden in my stuffed animals' eyes but the fear has never gone away even when I have always logically understood that this is an irrational fear. This has pushed me to a desire to cover the cameras on my phone, turn my stuffed animals away so I can't see their eyes, and close the vents in the house. I don't act on this desire, mostly because I don't want my parents to question any weird behavior.

In the house my family and I used to live in, this fear also applied to the large mirror in my bathroom that my brain automatically decided was a one-way mirror used to spy even though there was only a wall that separated the bathroom from the office behind it.

I tried to tell it to my family but they are not really open minded about this topic. My parents can't see the reasons why I've been sad the whole time because they told me ""You have everything you want and need."" I started getting these panic attacks last year and I've been having trouble with it especially when it happens in public places. I am so lucky that my friends are supportive and really caring.

60,"I got dumped a few months ago, and I put her as the center of my life. She was the center of my life. But we were never really official. Like I loved her and she constant lied and said she loved me back. But she didn't want her parents to think we were. But for some reason in my mind it's like we've been ""married"" for an eternity. 

I literally can't stop thinking about her for more than a few minutes. And you might think I'm just being dramatic but it's been almost 3 months and I just can't distract myself. Ive tried exercising, I've been trying so hard to make friends, therapy, self medicating. But I can't deal with this. The last few weeks have gotten so bad. I've started thinking about her every second that I'm awake. And then I dream about her all night too. 

I see suicide as the only way to stop this. I am hurting so bad. I don't know how to fix this issue any other way. I feel like a year ago I was a pretty sane person. People liked me, I had a great relationship. But I threw that away and found this girl. I think I was mentally deteriorating months before I met her. But there's nothing I can do. She blocked me months ago because I told her I was going to try to forget about her and I deleted all of our history. But I'm sure she didn't really care. I was probably just being obnoxious. It was like getting rid of a pest.

Now I just want to die. I want to get rid of this. And I know it's going to hurt my family. And nobody close to me is going to understand. But I am in so much pain. I know how I'm going to do it but I don't know how I'm going to be able to. But I crave it so much. It's the only way to stop obsessing over her. 

I'm sorry this has been so unstructured but i am so sick. And I'm not having an anxiety attack either. This has become the normal state of mind for me. Constant anxiety. There has to be a way I can fix these psychotic issues. But I'm not seeing it anywhere. Maybe I'm an offshoot. Maybe I have the worst case of obsessive thoughts ever.

65,"Hi everyone!

I'm living at home for the next month or so (for financial reasons) before leaving for grad school in a month. I experience depersonalization and derealization as a trauma response, and have made a ton of progress thanks to my amazing therapist. But I'm pretty terrified that all the headway I've made in the last year is going to get undone- or that I'm going to go into a depression, or regress back into the person I was before I moved out. For more context:

Growing up, both my parents (especially BPDmom) were extremely emotionally - and sometimes physically- abusive towards me and my sister. As a child, I was constantly told that I had ""discipline problems""--despite the fact that I was a soft-spoken, obedient kid who thrived at school, and no one else could corroborate their perspective of me as a ""bad"" kid. My parents would even give us 'behavior reports' after every family outing - and eventually, this need to keep us in line resulted in them cutting off access to TV and cell phones throughout high school, and putting controls on our computers that blocked access to almost everything online and automatically sent them logs of our search histories. The only sites I was allowed to access were Factmonster and Wikipedia (for school), and my computer would shut off every thirty minutes (unless my parents extended the time or approved sites manually)--and if I tried to circumvent these restrictions through proxies, they'd know because of the search logs. I had virtually no way to reach my friends (who were few and far between to start with), or know what was happening outside of my house. When I asked why they were doing this, they said that it was because my sister and I didn't deserve the privileges that normal children get. I've deeply internalized this, and still start to panic in situations where I feel like I'm being watched or appraised.

This went on for about six or seven years, until i left for college. My parents' marriage started to deteriorate over that time, and BPDmom took her rage out on me and my sister- and had ample opportunity, since she was a stay at home mom. She convinced us that every friend and family member in our lives secretly hated us, or was laughing behind our backs, or could never care about us because we were useless and terrible (""If only they knew who you really were!""). This has pretty much ruined my relationship with my cousins.

One time, she made me kneel in the bathroom, spat in my hair, and told me she wished I'd never been born. She carped and criticized and scrutinized every little thing I did, snooping and double checking any task I had to make sure I ""did it right""- when in reality, she wanted me to feel as incompetent and dependent on her as possible. Like many people with BPD, she was constantly petrified that we would leave her, and would call dozens of times and leave nasty messages if we ever went out with friends. She had zero regard for our physical autonomy or personal space- there were multiple times that she barged into my room ""accidentally"" while I was half naked, or would burst in without knocking with a suspicious look on her face, like she was sure she'd catch me doing something ""bad"". I remember one time when my dad took my sister and I out to Olive Garden to ask us whether he should divorce mom - I was around 14 at the time, and asked him if he loved her. He couldn't answer, so I told him that maybe it would be best if he moved on. I remember feeling so numb about the whole thing- until my mom came and told me that my dad said to her, ""I can't believe how terrible my daughter must be for her to wish for her parents to get divorced"". Right, after he came to his kid daughter for help in the first place. It wasn't til years later that I found out that he'd actually said that he couldn't believe how terrible his MARRIAGE had to be for his daughter to encourage a divorce. Fun wordplay, huh?

Another relevant story's from when I was in high school - I was clinically depressed and read that keeping a diary could be helpful, so I wrote some entries and kept them hidden well in a notebook inside a folder in my backpack (she would've found it for sure if I kept it in my room). My mom always went through my things despite my telling her not to, and eventually found the diary - the last entry was about how much pain I was in, and how I didn't know how to make it stop. She immediately screamed at me for never appreciating what she's done for me, and told the rest of my family about what happened. I had the SATs the next morning, and my dad told me during the drive over that I had nothing to be so wound up about, and that I was ungrateful and overreacting. Needless to say, the test didn't go great. But, since they didn't think I was actually depressed, they didn't get me any psychiatric help, and I don't think I'll ever forgive them for that.

After I graduated, I warned my mom that if she continued to treat me this way, I would go no-contact. She didn't believe me, but I managed to go NC for a whole year. And, it was probably one of the best decisions I ever made. I finally started to make friends--I still remember how shocked I was that people actually wanted to be around me, and seemed to appreciate me just as I was. I only spoke to her if I ever visited the house, or if absolutely necessary. Of course, she didn't have a damn clue why I didn't want to talk to her and tried to guilt her way back in. I eventually caved when she said she wanted me to tell her five things she should change about herself. But soon after, she told me that my boyfriend-at-the-time was being awful to me because I was sleeping with him, and that ""even therapy couldn't help a slut like me""- and then denied it right to my face during the one and only time I went with them for family therapy.

So yeah, our relationship is pretty fucked. I've spent the last two years living out of state for work and have been doing really well- have a strong social network and been seeing a therapist twice a week. I have a month to kill before grad school starts in Illinois and I decided to stay at my parents' house for financial reasons- but I'm pretty terrified because it's only been five days and I'm already starting to lose my grip on what's actually happened and feeling extremely suffocated and depersonalized. I wrote out all this background as an attempt to remind myself of what went down, and I'd really welcome any suggestions on how to ""hold onto yourself"" and your progress when you're around your BPD-family members for extended periods of time and start to wonder if you're misremembering everything.

TLDR; I'm at home living with BPDmom for a month before grad school, and can already feeling myself start to dissociate and lose touch with reality. What's helped you guys hold onto what's actually true?

Thank you &lt;3",06Jul2019,7

I've been seeing a guy lately and I like him a lot but I have the increasing feeling that maybe I shouldn't be trying for this kind of stuff. I have nothing going on in my life except mental instability. It's scary to think about but I feel like I might be losing my mind.

I saw my doctor yesterday for a checkup on the anti deppressants and had the awkward job of explaining what happended and she seemed really concerned the whole time and told me its likely hypomania and I should see a therapist, Ive had a bit of history with gambling, drug abuse, bad spending habits, that kind of thing and she seemed to be convinced i was gonna do something retarded.  I dont feel the need to meth in an alleyway, I feel great and for now ill stick with weed and booze.

70,"I've wanted to be skinny and dainty since probably midelementary school but I've always been chubby.  I used to have bulimia and did some diets like only eating 800 or less calories a day and honestly those things worked for a while but were not sustainable.

Finally I started making a healthy lifestyle change and have been monitoring my calories less and just exercising a lot (running).  I'm losing inches off my waist but the number on the scale doesn't change which tells me I'm gaining muscle - but that's not really what a girl who wants to be ""dainty"" wants.  I understand on a very surface level that it's really stupid to want to be thin and have little muscle but a lot of my exes were into that, or at least preferred a thin girl with no muscle to a muscley girl with some fat (as mentioned before Ive wanted to be that way for a long time due to my parents and friends). I think I just have to accept that I might never be 110 pounds even if I eventually become fit (130 lb, 5'4"" right now).  I hate how fat I am and it makes me embarrassed to go outside.  I feel like a giant monster whenever I see myself or walk or sit down.  I don't think I'm in denial about my body, but I feel like self loathing helps me lose weight sometimes.  I think if anyone reads this post they would say I'm definitely not in a state of self acceptance, and I'm not even really certain of what that means, because I feel like I'm very aware of my situation and that I've got no choice but to deal with the fact that I'm disgusting right now but might be able to change into something slightly less disgusting.

In fact it can become a very toxic form of cope if I begin to think 'I'm better than person x who's hurt me because of the way I look for my current superiority in y non-looks attribute'

3. Trying to negotiate merits of ugliness will never work because being ugly logically always an inferior option to being less or not ugly. It's ultimately a form of lying to oneself and self-awareness + clarity has always been the only way I was able to progress forward.

How does one deal with the emotional pain? It comes in many forms, such as knowing that I will have inferior job acceptance because of my appearance, or simple twinges of pain when people in public transport move away from me because of how I look.

I feel like I've been in a long battle of the various stages of grief (oscillating frequently between anger, denial and bargaining) and sometimes grasp at acceptance, but the emotional pain really eats at me frequently.

I've read about CBT before but am unsure if it could help me. What other options should I look out for?",06Jul2019,3

93," Hello, I was wondering if anyone has been through the same situation and or could advise.  

**Issues**

Ever since I was born I've always been incredibly uncomfortable when it comes to social interactions, I feel more often than not like an alien. Even at a young age I felt like the odd one out and I was never very assertive with my peers unless I felt like I was their equal, which was rare. I‚Äôm certainly wired differently to others and its very clear to a few people.

&amp;#x200B;

In some situations if someone were to say something negative to me, even as a joke, I can become very sad, I don't show this of course but the ‚Äújoke‚Äù puts me down for a short to long duration of time, more so than it should, from an outside lens I can see how strange it is to get so upset over so little. Even so I'm sometimes not sure if what somebody said was intended as a joke or not and I'll run through it in my mind a thousand times trying to work it out.  

In my youth I was very avoidant of social situations due to all manner of fears, less so in adult hood but I still feel uneasy going into some.

&amp;#x200B;

The above has been nothing but cancer to my life, at a young age I always knew this level of sensitivity would translate worse into adulthood. At 27, I have no friends or relationship, I‚Äôve walked away from many jobs due to low self esteem.  

I do have a job still that I enjoy but feel like I can barely maintain due to my own social incompatibility around my colleagues. My manager is somewhat aware of my issues and has unfortunately seen me breakdown, which pains me more so as they now know how weak minded and sensitive I am, which is unheard of for someone of my age.

I can pull off appearing stable and socially competent on a surface level but in situations such as work where I'm around people for longer periods of time it proves more difficult to socially fit in when people want a deeper level of social interaction.  

&amp;#x200B;

Issues like pity also arise which always further cement the descent into losing my job, recently for example my manager out of pity will sometimes ask me if I'd like to hang out with them and a few colleagues after work, I've turned down a few of these offers for reasons below in the past but not all, this however leads to another uncomfortable situation, not all my colleagues would like to share my manager‚Äôs offer of pity, and rightfully so, many of them are aware I'm not socially viable and my presence destroys the normal social vibes they get to enjoy with one another when I‚Äôm not around. I‚Äôm not enjoyable to be around, I‚Äôm a burden, I don‚Äôt want to be a burden to those around me and would rather be isolated than go to a party I was only invited to because people felt sorry for me.  

I feel generally incompatible with everyone, like an imposter human that gets in everyone‚Äôs way.

&amp;#x200B;

**What I‚Äôve done to combat this so far**

At 24, I knew I had to really start taking action if I were to live a happy life, I‚Äôve done counselling for a good number of years some of which was experimental, this has really helped me in many ways understand myself more and why I have many of the issues I do, furthermore its given me more practical ways of dealing with social interactions and assertiveness on the surface level which I struggled with in the past. Eating better and lifting are something I am going to need to maintain better too.  

&amp;#x200B;

**What to do now?**

I think perhaps practising more socialising may be in order but I‚Äôm not sure how you can really practice something that goes beyond surface level easily.  

Apologies this post is a bit everywhere, I hope its somewhat understandable.

94,"I have posted this on another subreddit, but it didn't quite give me an answer.

Please tell me if this doesn't fit here. 

Sometimes I will say things, that in my mind are perfectly acceptable, but are either inappropriate or hurt the other person's feelings. Worse is, for whatever reason, I can't seem to form the connection in my brain that these things might be offensive. Like, my brain can't find the pattern. 

An example of this behavior is, I was buying food, and I accidentally said that I was putting my bf and myself on the same ticket. Upon sitting down, he asked why I said that. I casually mentioned that I usually pay for stuff anyway, so it's a force of habit. When I said that, I genuinely didn't see it as mean or condescending. He did. I of course apologized, and felt truly terrible about it, but I still don't understand, at an emotional level (yes, he did explain why it was mean to me) how it was bad.

Is there some reason I lack tact, or do I just need to learn when something is offensive?

96,"There I was in a freezing, empty hospital room stripped from all my clothes and belongings waiting to be examined and transferred to the behavioral health facility just a few floors above. ‚ÄúBehavioral Health‚Äù - I appreciate how they attempt to embellish what it actually is: a mental institution. 

Between 11 days inside and 3-4 years of therapy, I thought - up until now - that I was done being vulnerable. I put in my time, suffered enough and now I was done, I graduated from vulnerability, right? Unbelievably wrong...

To this day I find it incredibly difficult to express myself even to people closest to me. All the words in the world and nothing comes to me when I have an opportunity to say something. 

In the rare occasion that I do, I immediately judge what I say. Nothing I say comes without an explanation and immediate regret for exposing my feelings. Ashamed to feel the way I feel. 

Now, I realize there‚Äôs a whole mess of issues that I now have to confront. I am grateful, however, that I came to this realization today. 
I interact with so many people and I often notice how much they share without hesitation. No judgment on my part - the exact opposite in fact - I listen with admiration and compassion, hoping one day I can do the same even on a small scale. 


Today I know why this is - that period in my life was incredible scarring (figuratively &amp; literally) that I‚Äôve only defined vulnerability by what I‚Äôve been through. The most extreme version I‚Äôve experienced. Today I know my next step is to reframe what is vulnerability to me and move forward with the new scalability factor.

This is really difficult for me to talk about, but I have to, I feel like nobody I know and trust understands. Ever since I was a kid I've struggled with social anxiety and mild depression. I'm 26 now and I've had my ups and downs, and until recently I thought the worst was behind me. I have a crippling fear of uncertainty (kind of a control freak) and it stops me from pushing myself out of my teeny-tiny comfort zone. I've talked to a therapist once and she was pretty terrible, but that experience motivated me to figure shit out by myself. I started exercising, meditating, doing breathing exercises...the whole 9 yards. It really helped, for a while. 

A couple of months ago I started having delusional thoughts. Paranoia. I feel as though people are out to get me. It manifested itself as distrust, for example, if a friend changes their behavior towards me in any way I would think I fucked up somehow and they're hiding it. Smoking (read self-medicating) sometimes helped, but soon enough I started thinking how the cops would eventually bang at my door, so I don't smoke anymore. 

I live with my SO and he still smokes occasionally, I've talked to him about how I feel and he now confines himself in his room whenever he smokes because the smell freaks me out. I feel as though it's not fair of me to dictate what he does, so forcing him to stop completely feels wrong. I love him and he's trying his best to accomodate me but it's not easy for either of us at the moment. I can't blame him for not knowing what to do.
For the past few weeks it's gotten out of hand, to the point where I feel the urge to regularly check outside in case someone is coming for us. I know it's crazy, believe me. I live in a place where sooo many people smoke, even the cops (they even sell the shit). Realistically speaking, nobody gives a crap about it. Every single person I know does it to some degree and isn't worried in the slightest. Rationalizing shit to myself is the only thing that helps, but I still feel scared 80% of my day. We moved to a place where there's constant traffic and it has seriously spiked my anxiety. I can't stop checking the street, flinching when I hear people talking etc. And because of this, my suicidal thoughts are back. 

I'm crying while writing this because it's so fucking hard to admit, but I just want to stop feeling. I just want to be ok and to feel safe and I don't think I ever will. I'm not writing this for sympathy, I couldn't care less. What I'm hoping for is constructive comments or advice as to how I should battle this. I feel like my sanity is slipping daily.",06Jul2019,0

I'm male, 20y/o college student.

From 8 to 18 I've been greatly addicted to video games.

&amp;#x200B;

The last 2 years I tried changing, but my discipline is unstable. I can't control my desires and 'watching just 1 episode' turns into an entire day lost. I have no impulse control.

&amp;#x200B;

In those 2 years I've learned one thing- I can only (AND ONLY) do useful any useful and consistent work when I am a 100% dedicated to work and give myself no fun &amp; relax time during the day.

If I'm not a workaholic, I am helplessly unmotivated and lazy, and I can't do anything about it.

If I acknowledge the tiniest bit of entertainment-seeking in my life, It's only a matter of days until it goes out of control.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried countless techniques, like off-days, timers signalizing break time is over, but I just brush it aside and continue.

Only when I remove any chance of relaxation in the whole week am I safe from this curse.

&amp;#x200B;

I love learning, workaholism doesn't bother me, I love it in fact. It's just that, after a long day, I just want to change the scenery for a short while, in order to relax and clear my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

A schedule with fun time just physically doesn't work for me. Why...? I don't understand.

It mostly happens with heights, but also on other occasions (not very often though). 
I do not in any way feel suicidal and never ever give it a thought whenever I'm on the ground. I can't always be bothered with life, but mostly because I don't really see the meaning. It's not like I just sit at home and do nothing, I'm actually pretty active and have different hobbies. 
I'm not really sure who could help me. I don't want any meds since I don't feel it's that bad. I've considered going for some kind of alternative treatment. 
From what I know about depression, that's not the problem. I'm on the spectrum (high functioning, most people never notice) and I've read we can be vulnerable to depression and such things. I just don't fit with most/enough symptoms.

I'm a 20 years old male, and I'm currently studying in the UK.
I am experiencing family issues, and I might be depressed. I'm 80% sure, however, I don't want to get checked by a doctor.
Why?
Because if I do, and I do actually get diagnosed with depression, I will have to tick yes, on job application forms that ask if you suffer from mental illness. Now, I don't think any employer will be willing a suicidal dude, so I don't want to risk it.
Also, I can't afford medicines or therapy.

My parents are idiots, and I hate them. They are strict Muslims, while I am an atheist, this already caused manu issues. I never had fun, I couldn't go out with friends, I couldn't go out with girls whatsoever. I never  been with a girl, I have zero social skills. Since I was born I got brainwashed into thinking that doing those things, were sin.
Then, at 9, I saw the truth, that my parents are really bad people, and they should not be allowed to have kids.
I grew up mainly with my mother, and her only thought is money. Since a young age, she wanted to make me an engineer, when it came the time to choose a path, I chose IT, and enrolled into a school (the one you go before uni, not sure if it's an high school, or something else, as it depends from your country).
Guess what she did?
SHE WENT TO THE FUCKING PRINCIPAL, AND CHANGED MY CHOICE.
Forcing me to take engineering, as she thought that engineering would make me earn more. She always said to do engineering, and that when I get a job I should give her half of my income.
And it's not the only thing. The only person that ever bullied me, was my mother. Always calling me fat, idiot, stupid and more.
She's not even nice with my younger brother, he's 3, and I haven't seen a day where she doesn't beat him.
After 4 years of studying engineering (I needed to study 5 years, to get the diploma needed for uni, so that was 4 years wasted), we moved here in England (from another EU country), and here I managed to get into IT, finally.
Here my mother started forcing me to take religious studies, and go to various Muslim bullshit, and I have to go, otherwise she would kick me out; and I kinda need a house.

I started planning, my idea was to get the qualification I need to get into uni, so that I could move into the dorms. So I did, I got the qualification needed, with the top grade possible...but, student finance England fucked me up. I can't apply for a loan, as I lived in the UK for only 3 years.
My backup plan was to find a full-time job, in another country, but they all ask for more experience. So it's not working well.
I am not staying with my parents anymore z I can't. I can't do it. Mentally. The way they treat me it's horrible. I know I am a grown up, but I can't find a way to get away from them.

Do you know what it feels like to not being loved? Like ever? As said before I never been with anyone, I never met someone who cared for me. I achieved most things by myself, but I can't achieve independence.
You know why my parents moved to England? Only because they could get more money from stuff like child benefit, and stuff. That's the only reason, they can't even SPEAK English.

At this point, I have no options... I don't know what to do.
8t never happened before, but now, the only solutions is suicide. Lately I can't think of anything else.
I made an entire plan on it. Date, time, how...
I don't even have real friends to talk to. Most of them just pretend to be friends, so that I would help them with their assignments.
The date that I've set myself is not near, but not that far either.

I'm writing here, to see if I am overreacting, if I am actually depressed. Of I can find alternative solutions. At the moment, between now, and the date, I'm trying to find a job in coding, in various countries, so that I can move out; but as said before, it's hard without experience.

I don't want to die now. I don't want to die without having been happy once. But I can't think of anything else. I know that I might get a job outside the IT world, but at that point I would be depressed about a job 5hat I hate.

I know that there are people who got it worse. I know that having parents, and having a rooftop is more than a lot of people, but I still feel bad.

I'd like to know how you people have some solutions.
Sorry for the long post, and probably for some grammatical errors, but I am writing in a bad moment.
If you have any questions, ask. I'll try to answer them.",06Jul2019,2
111,"I‚Äôve been on Prozac for about 3 months now. It‚Äôs generally been amazing for me and intensity of my anxiety and depression on a day to day basis feels reduced. However, in the last few weeks, I‚Äôve began having panic attacks. It‚Äôs really confusing for me because I feel so good the rest of the time. I didn‚Äôt have panic attacks before I started taking it. 

Has anyone else experienced this? I‚Äôm a bit gutted because I really don‚Äôt want to come off them when they‚Äôve been helping so much otherwise.",06Jul2019,3
112,"It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm not proud of myself, I‚Äôm still 18 and I know I have worked hard to get into university although I didn‚Äôt have the best upbringing in life. But my sister keeps bringing it up and saying she is so proud of me but whenever she says it I tear up or even cry and I actually don‚Äôt know why. Even when my parent‚Äôs say it I just feel sad and like I don‚Äôt deserve to be praised. It makes me sad that this is making me cry. I feel like lately I‚Äôve been really emotional (I would say it‚Äôs birth control but I doubt it as I‚Äôve always been like this). Also whenever I leave home to go back to uni I cry even though I know I‚Äôll see my family in like 2-3 weeks. And I try to hide it because I don‚Äôt want anyone to think there‚Äôs something wrong with me. I do suffer with depression although nobody in my family knows about it as I find it so hard to open up, not that I don‚Äôt trust them, I have the most supportive family but I just don‚Äôt want them to feel bad for me. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm like this and it‚Äôs really frustrating, I even tried pinching myself SO HARD the other day to not cry when I left home but didn‚Äôt really help. If anyone could give me some advice it would really mean alot.",06Jul2019,1
113,"From my point of view, this is kind of interesting. I often wonder if really got a problem regarding my mental health or if I'm being unreasonable/childish. 

Thing is, I'm young so I shouldn't worry that much about my life and what the future has to offer. But here I am, overthinking everything this making my life harder with very thought I have. I don't really know if it's a part of my personality or a coping mechanism but it's really affecting my interactions. 

I had a pretty nice childhood apart from the fact that I've always been different from any of the people I've encountered. See I'm a mixed girl in an essentially white region and I haven't had any colour with my origins on the black side. It's not like it hasn't bothered me to the point I couldn't function but I'm starting to believe that it could be a reason why I feel so out of place, so insecure and misunderstood. 

I thought once that I had a borderline personality while I was in depression but no one seemed to give any attention to this theory. 

Every time I try do something good, it's like I will naturally fail, at least when it comes to a personal matter. I compulsively denigrate my image and my abilities, I tend to question every I have in life until my relatives genuinely believe that I'm ungrateful. The problem is that I could be, I could be anything that they say, paranoid, unsatisfied and selfish. Because I cannot prove otherwise. It's life I have a personality disorder, I alternate short phases when I'm on top of my world then I get completely neutral, unable to feel the leat emotion and then I get depressed and self destructive. I have a complete fear of being unreasonable or too much for my environment, which often the case for the later, if only because of how I look.

And even now that I'm writing this, I'm starting to see how I dramatize my situation when really it's serious for me. I can't keep a friendship because sooner or later it turns out that I'm not enough, I can't start a relatives because I considere myself unable to be in one. 

Maybe what I'm saying does not make any sense but I've got a long day with another failure to add to my list so I'm doing it anyway. Thank you for reading this.",06Jul2019,2

115,"Hey, I'm a 24 [M] from Sweden. I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for most of my adult life, but during May through June this year, things have been even worse. I have been indulging in self-harm and suicidal thoughts. However, on the 1st of July, my mood suddenly and drastically shifted. I became extremely happy, almost euphoric, excited, and restless. I can barely get any sleep and I have a hard time focusing on things and sitting still. It's as if everything I knew about depression and anxiety is suddenly gone (although I still get very minor anxiety sometimes). At first, I thought the anti-depressants had kicked in, but I realize that what I'm feeling isn't normal. This has lasted from July 1st up until today. I worry that I might have some sort of bipolar disorder, but I don't want to self-diagnose. If anyone has any idea what might cause this, please feel free to tell me, thanks.",06Jul2019,2
116,I need to read around/discuss some answers to this question; were you treated for one diagnosis but later discovered it should have been another diagnosis all along?,06Jul2019,6
117,i don‚Äôt have anyone i can talk to or dare to. previously i would always talk to my best friend but he‚Äôs in a relationship and i feel like i‚Äôm being invasive by asking for so much from him. the only person im able to talk to is my driving teacher and that‚Äôs because i get panic attacks while driving so he‚Äôs kinda forced to know. but i feel like i‚Äôm stuck in a rut. nothing ever seems to be changing and i feel so ducking damn suffocated. i know that my family loved me but they don‚Äôt understand me and my brother finds it difficult to respect me. it hurts. plus i‚Äôm a foreigner and it feels like i can never fit in.,06Jul2019,1
118,"I come home, where my abusive mother yells and screams at my dad and then yells and screams at me. I go to work, where I get bullied by my superiors (I‚Äôm not the only one however. It‚Äôs so bad that they‚Äôve been reported to the relevant labour board and are under fire). I go hang out with friends and now some of them have started to make fun of me. The only person who makes me feel valued is my gf, but unfortunately, I‚Äôm still trying to process her one night stand affair awhile back, which she claims is a huge mistake and helped her realize how much she loves me. My mind is just swimming, I‚Äôm sorry for wasting your time. Take care everyone",06Jul2019,1
119,"I cant explain what the heavy burden is very well. Its i always have intrusive thoughts 
(There even worse when im near people) 
I have a hapid of following/copying people. 
I have trouble socializing
I say things i dont really see offensive but people think its offensive 
All i can think of to say to people are bad things. Hitting myself
Theres more. I just dont feel like writing it",06Jul2019,1
120,"To start things off, I think it is important to know that I have always been a very deep, philosophical thinker and along with that I have been diagnosed with mild OCD. Basically, I sometimes think a bit too hard about i.e. the meaning of life and my OCD really manifests that idea in my head. 

Another weird symptom that has just started occurring in the past 2 months is that I have these weird thought that go a little something like ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm actually a brain controlling a body and making decisions‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat really is consciousness‚Äù. These thoughts have never really affected me in any significant way but recently, during my junior year of high school they have caused a bit of depression. 

I‚Äôm going to see a therapist to talk things over on Monday, but I‚Äôm wondering do these symptoms sound familiar to anyone. 

Much appreciated.",06Jul2019,1
