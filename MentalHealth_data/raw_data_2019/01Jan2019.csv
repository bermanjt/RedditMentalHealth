0," School shootings remain rare, even after 2018, a year of historic carnage on K-12 campuses. What’s not rare are lockdowns, which have become a hallmark of American education and a byproduct of this country’s inability to curb its gun violence epidemic. Lockdowns save lives during real attacks, but even when there is no gunman stalking the hallways, the procedures can inflict immense psychological damage on children convinced that they’re in danger. And the number of kids who have experienced these ordeals is extraordinary.   See story [here.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/how-school-lockdowns-traumatize-kids/ar-BBRsl5S)

2,"I don’t really know though. 
I have BPD, GAD Depression and hints of bipolar. I’m not medicated currently, but I need to be. On a wait list to see a psychiatrist again. 

I’ve been hallucinating small things the past year. Just random sounds, some vague voices, and occasionally seeing things like doors opening etc (seems very dream like though. I can know it’s me seeing things pretty quick). 

I got cheated on and dumped after 4 years because I hit a real low. And since then I’ve been enlightened. I know how the inner workings of the universe work, I remembered it all. We are just energy pillars, and emotional pillars. We have a purpose and ignore it. 

But I don’t know if I’m being disillusioned with that belief or not??? I sincerely believe what I know, but I’m also very self aware that it might be something else?

What steps should I be taking? I don’t tell my therapist these things as she tends to blow them off or gets weird about it (I want a new one but I don’t want to go back to a wait list).  Is there something I can do??  ",01Jan2019,1

I’ve had the past three days off work and although my apartment is a disgusting mess, I have done nothing but lay in bed. I know that’s not helping me improve anything, but everything else seems so impossible. I can’t help but sit here and think about how perfect things were this time last year. I was with my husband, my step brother, and his girlfriend and we were all getting ready to go out to a dive bar for their last night being open. I was so happy and I took it all for granted and then ruined all of it. I hope things will get better this year, but I just don’t see how.",01Jan2019,1
4,"They say hindsight is 20-20 meaning that after we’ve learned about something we think it was obvious all along. Many believe that psychology is just common sense, that the basics of the field are logical and therefore we all know about them. Yet many psychological studies have reported findings that are absolutely counter intuitive and which seem illogical. Some of these include:

1. Gender Identity Is More Nature Than Nurture
2. Emotional Intelligence Positively Predicts Life Satisfaction But Cognitive Intelligence Negatively Predicts Life Satisfaction
3. Suppressing Your Anger May Actually Be Good For You
4. Positive Self-Statements May Not Benefit Those With Low Self Esteem

5,"The year had started out ""normally"" for me. In the Spring, I decided to write a Fan Fiction story for my favorite character from my favorite online game...and that had triggered one of my deepest, darkest secrets that I had been holding in my heart and mind for decades. I tried to ignore it...but it had grown and grown until it became full-blown and took over my life, basically. I am now fighting it every single day of my existence (which isn't actually as bad as it sounds) and I have had some ups and downs since late summer, which is when it had come out full-force in me. There is no going back now, so I sit with this disorder and I am learning how to control it, and I am learning a lot about myself in the process. I am stronger than I'd thought and I have more willpower than I'd ever thought I'd have.  


2018 wasn't a bad year. It was a year of discovery and a little bit of pain (I was in denial for a while before my best friend made me see that I do have this disorder, which I had confirmed with a professional later), but otherwise, it has been a quiet, okay year. I hope 2019 is the same for me and I hope it is good for everyone here. I can only hope that this coming year treats everyone well...and that we all can find some happiness in our lives.

6,"When you finally realize that your mental issues, though not your fault you have them, are your responsibility to manage and to deal with the consequences? The hardest part for me with my mental health right now are that I'm at a point where I realize that it may not be my fault that I have depression, anxiety, and codependency issues, that it sure as hell is my responsibility to deal with.

But to accept that is to accept that the things you did to your friends family and loved ones WHERE your fault, because you failed to manage your issues appropriately. Ever relationship, ever judging eye from the aftermath of one of your episodes, and ever social rejection from an event taken back or withheld because this wasn't a one time issue was warranted and earned. You've gotten better before, healthy and happy, but then you fell back into your dark place again and screwed up again. And you hurt people again.  And you've lost their trust again. 

You used to find solace in the fact that these things weren't your fault.  It was your dads fault for the neglect and failing of giving any type of fatherly support. It was the bullies on the school bus's fault for making you scared and ultimately unable to truly trust or make new friendships fault. It was the fact that your best friend joined the bullies on the bus and started to bully you to save himself's fault. THESE where the reasons you couldn't form healthy relationships.  THESE where the reasons you fell into addiction and alcoholism.  These are the reasons you have trouble holding a job.

But while all those events happened, It really wasn't anybody else's fault. It was mine.  I chose to make the decisions I did. I chose to drink and do drugs. I chose to do actions that would interfere with my work.  I am responsible.  And I'm having trouble looking at the wreckage of my life and saying to myself ""I did this...""

So while understand that I'm the only one to blame, I don't know how to take the next step and improve my life when the weight of the consequences of my actions are dragging me down.  I'm not the good guy in this story. But I'd like to be. So I just wanted to ask you guys how do you move on?

Once idealistic, passionate, ambitious, I became disillusioned with everything and everyone I believe in over the course of some events and realizations, I don't know how to enjoy myself around people, I don't trust anymore and have lost all my opinions and perspective on life. I tried creating a character that I would grow into, but it feels fake and hollow. I have no aim and am unable to maintain relationships, be that with friends, family or partners.

8,"... of survival stories of another year, that I may drown.

This year was actually pretty good. Started going to therapy... Probably had the ""kill yourself"" thoughts a little less than usual... But today was bad.

Actually, today was just the culmination of years of low key bad.
Two years ago (my worst year), I was separated from my wife and kids for the majority of it. Long story short, my boss lied to my face about a transfer, so I was stuck for ~9 months while my family moved two and a half hours away. My days off are usually separated, so I could only afford to be home for about 12 waking hours a week with my wife, year old son, and six year old stepson, who spent most of those weekends with his dad. 

Digression of background: I'm an Eeyore by nature. My wife and kids are the only thing that keep me from... Really really dark places.

Needless to say, this was not a healthy time in my life. Toward the end, I called in sick multiple times after my day off, as the thought of driving away from the only reason to exist paralyzed me with depression.

I didn't call in sick once this last year. But I've been carrying that increased depression with me since then. I'm pretty consistently 1 to 5 minutes late to work, which is my fault, but I have to fight so hard to get out of bed every morning... 

I called in sick on Saturday, as I was busy literally shitting the bed... But because I didn't get a doctor's note to tell me that I was shitting the bed, and it was in conjunction with my day off on Sunday, it was a problem. Which I found out after I got to work later than usual this morning. I probably am not going to lose my job right now, but the thin ice definitely broke.

But I realized today, that I truly want to kill myself. It's not just intrusive thoughts that I don't believe or agree with... I am so tired of being in this wretched, broken, disgusting world...
But I have my family. And I love them and need to be here for them. I want to be here for them. Honestly, that's the only thing I have ever wanted in my entire life.
But, as I have obviously put their well being at risk with my unacceptable attendance, I am very aware that, regardless of the fact that I can't, and I won't... I yearn to kill myself, and I've just been laughing it off for years.

Anyway... We're fine. We're all fine here... ... How are you?",01Jan2019,1

13,"This is a rant, because I have nobody I can talk to. I've had terrible mental health lately, despite this is am more positive then I have ever been because I adopted a cat 2 months ago, he is the best thing that have happened to me since I lost my dog to old age 5yrs ago. I am doing my best to get better for the kitty, even though it's really hard to even get out of bed he always have food, clean water and a cleab litterbox.

But I am spending energy I don't have, I want to be happy and be able to care for him, but my constant exhaustion and worrying is starting to seep through and while I know it's no good to bottle it up, I got nowhere to get the steam of sorta. Add to that a terrible Christmas. I lost $100, and as someone living on not even disability (sick leave, but for 1.5yr so not enough really), it's all of my non-bill money, a friend went into coma and died a few days later, and now today I was told by my landlord that I need to move out by the end of February because ""change of plans"". My co-pay for healthcare also started up again as it's jan 1st. So while only paying $250-$300 per year in total for all health and mental health sound great, it means I basically have to pay it within 2months due to my intense treatment plan. Oh, and I was hit my a firework today because fucking teenagers are given firework so their drunk parents can be left in peace. 

Financial stress is my biggest trigger of suicidal toughts, because I have lived me entire life barely scraping by and essentially begging for handouts to stay alive - and I do not want that for the rest of my life. But how am I going to cope with medical costs, moving apartments - with the damn cat that makes everything twice as expencive, dealing with my ""backlog"" of owed money now due to the lost$100 (I need to borrow to eat essentially) and then on top of it all be happy and cheerfull and gratefull for the people around me. I can't. But if I hurt myself then the cat looses his home and he is special needs, and finally feels safe for once in his life. I'm just so tired. I want to sleep and never wake up again. I hate people, but I know I need people to help me, so in turn I hate myself too. I know the logical thing is to ask advice from my caseworker, but that will sound so much like begging, and it'll be asking far too much of them.  Maybe I should just take the cat with me to sleep",01Jan2019,1
14,"I'm a 22 year old male, I work halftime at a junior school as an assistant for teachers. Half time because I can't handle alot of work, I get tired and overwhelmed.

When i was 16 i figured out that i was gay, i gained weight due to cooking school which had a negative effect on me. I never really had alot of friends ever. I've spent most of my life in my room playing games and watching youtube.

the time between 16 and 20 years old i was abused online, threatened, people saw a way too friendly stranger and took advantage. I was hurt in several ways during those years, self-esteem is horrible, i'm negative about myself and i cant stand myself.

I was also in a .. some kind of college thing for a year studying photography cause i didnt get a job after cooking school because i was lied to by people i had been having work experience at. At the college i had a room mate i didnt talk too much with, i did make some friends though we didnt hang every day, i did some exercise cuz of a friend i made but eventually quit when winter arrived, i was feeling really depressed, confused.. might've had some kind of existencial crisis.. started to really wanna change myself and get what i wanted in life.

I missed family ALOT too cuz it was my first time staying elsewhere than home, i went home on weekend sometimes but it was rough, i started just sitting in bed with my laptop watching videos and eating lots of treats to comfort myself.

after college i went to do another school, health- and careworker school for 2 years, was staying home this time.  1st year i had good grades cuz there was alot if useful things i could apply to my life, though i struggled still, went to school nurse.

after the first year, i had to go elsewhere for year 2. what we studied was kinda boring to me so my grades dropped, still having lots of lows in terms of mood. Didn't make friends or hang alot with anybody.

After all of this i had applied for a job too late, so i got help from this Norwegian program that helps people get a job and whatnot, so luckily i got a job at this junior school i work at now. This is my second year out of 3 years.. apprenticeship of some sort, just takes longer cuz i work 50%.

I looked for a proffessional to talk to about my problems, which i found and have been to for half a year or so. Its helping a little but i always feel like my problems are gone when im talking to someone, i cant get things out, struggle with words.

The past 3 years i've been really wanting to get good at something, find a talent or skill. I tried guitar for a bit but gave up, and i always wanna be good at online video games. But everytime i play a game and get angry, it triggers this.. depression i have following me, its painful. I get extremely angry when i do bad or die in a game to something i find is bullshit, the anger goes to sadness, i think about my life and everything that sucks and it honestly makes me want to not live anymore.

I Decided to write on here because I don't know where else to go, I just had a moment of anger and i'm so tired of feeling this way.. thats why im writing here. I wouldn't say im suicidal, but i have had dark thoughs and sometimes i just tell myself i dont want to live.

22,"This starts out as a short vent, but I'll lead into the general issue:

&amp;#x200B;

My family thinks I must be faking my problem of violent auditory hallucinations because I've never physically attempted to critically hurt anyone. So they feel the need to make my problems worse if I think I feel an oncoming psychotic episode by making fun of it and not leaving me be alone. Keep in mind: I have a professional medical diagnosis of this, have been and still am going through treatments, and have been in the psych ward many times for it.

&amp;#x200B;

But because they can't SEE these violent auditory hallucinations and I've never full-out acted on them, apparently that means I don't have this problem? I hate this thing of ""if you don't have cuts on your wrist or if you've never been in the hospital for attempted suicide, you must not be actually depressed"" or ""if you've never had a panic attack in front of people, you must not have real anxiety issues"" that are used on many people. I hate going through so much effort to hide my problems from others, and being called fake for doing so. Having this lack of support from my loved ones makes it that much harder to get better as well. I don't attempt to push it to have them avoid bringing up my triggers, I just ask to be allowed to find a place to be alone at if I feel like I might become a danger to others.

&amp;#x200B;

Just because some people don't make a scene of their mental disorders, doesn't mean they aren't struggling. If they are trying hard to hide it, it's possible they're struggling more since they have to hold it in. Also, if someones symptoms don't seem as severe as your own, doesn't mean they don't have the problem and aren't entitled to get help. Kids shouldn't need to come out about being depressed by attempting suicide because they have no other way to prove it's a real problem that they deal with. And they definitely shouldn't have to go as far as to commit suicide to show they struggled. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want people to get help without being told their OCD is for attention, and their depression is just an excuse to be lazy, their anxiety is just an excuse to avoid doing things, or their ADHD is just an excuse to misbehave. If people are so worried over others faking this stuff for pity, then maybe don't give them pity and that's the problem solved then? Instead of giving them these things you think they're faking problems to get, try to get them to see professional help and leave it at that instead of going out of your way to make it worse for them? 

&amp;#x200B;

Nobody should be allowed to do terrible things and get away with it by blaming their disorder, I get that. If that's the case, treat it like the law does: don't punish or hate them, but maybe send them to a psych ward to get help if they truthfully are harming others because they can't control theirselves.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone out there is afraid to come out about a struggle of theirs because they're afraid of being called an attention seeker, don't worry about these ignorant people. Know bottling it up will make it worse over time. Tell someone that will understand, maybe a school psychologist or a doctor before it becomes too severe to fix easily. Once you do that, it will be so much easier.",01Jan2019,1

36,"This is my first time posting this and i still have doubts about posting something personal here but i hope that somebody can answear me. Now i dont know if this is a mental problem but ever since i was a kid i was always scared to sleep alone. 

I dont remember something traumatizing happening to me but im still scared. There isint something that scares me that much but the thought of closing my eyes and not nobody watching what is happening infont of me scares me. I have it hard to shower with the curtains closed so i always peek. And i hate it that when i was a spoiled kid i asked my father to always watch me before i sleep, well not watch me but remain awake (watch tv,on smartphone it doesnt bother).  

&amp;#x200B;

I thought it would have been better over the years but now its started to make me go insane. I am seeing shadows (figures) or whatever in the corner of my eyes.  I know that its normal but now im starting to see some in the center of my eyes and one day when i was sleeping i had my stomache at the wall (i cant speak english well so il try to explain in as best as i can) and at my back is the rest of the room. When i was close to sleeping i heard i screaming like something was right behind me. I jumped and looked behind me, heavy breathing i was scared for fucking life.  Its giving me chills when im typing about it

&amp;#x200B;

What i wanted to get out of this is, is this a mental problem? can i fix it because i am really fucking hating to not be able to sleep and when i want to stay wake at night i have to wait for the fucking sun to rise even then i dont feel as comfortable. My parents always get angry at me because they think its nonsense and some of my cousin now of this and have laughed , i really dont want to say this to the internet but i really need help, or try to change this because i dont want my parents to stay awake for my sake.

37,"I posted a while ago about wishing someone irl would ask me if I was ok. Since then I’ve had a few people talk to me but I realized I don’t know what the hell to say and even if I did I don’t think they would understand. I just wish I had someone who *knew*, who I didn’t have to explain myself too. 

I know some of you guys understand but in my life nobody gets it. It’s not their fault though, you can’t understand something you’ve never experienced. How the hell are you supposed to explain depression to someone who’s never been there before? How the hell are they supposed to help you?

Every conversation I have ends with “You should talk to a professional”. No shit. How the fuck do I explain to someone that every time I even *think* about opening up to someone I have a panic attack. It took so much courage to respond with “No, actually I’m not ok” and it’s gets me nowhere. Absolutely nowhere.

God it seems so much easier to just jump off the overpass already. ",01Jan2019,1
38,"20 y/o male. Sorry its such a long post, but feel free to make a long comment, I'll read it. I feel its a good way for us to both vent about bad things and remember the good things.

Here's the last 10 years for me:

2008: One of the best, if not the best year of my life. The only bad thing that happened is my Great Grandma died. I turned 10 years old, felt like a big kid, and things were simple and great. It was the time where I began to understand reality to an extent, but still had that childhood bliss. There were also alot of firsts for me this year. First crush, first best friend, first book I wrote, and more.

2009: Oh boy. Everything flipped for the worst shortly after 2009 began. I mean, everything. My family went from Middle Class to Poverty, my grandma who was emotionally abusive was around all the time while my parents were out trying to keep food on the table, I started getting bullied when 6th grade began (and i dont mean here and there, I mean like 0-100, didn't get bullied hardly at all before, and then suddenly it seemed like everyone was out to get me). I lost almost all of my ""friends"". Plus, my youngest sister was born, which, dont get me wrong, I love her, but because of that, and our lack of money, my parents hardly had any time for me when i needed their time the most. I dont blame them though. Yeah, lets just say it was so bad I basically had borderline PTSD and a multitude of emotional issues for many years after.

2010: Shitty at first, but things started to look up around May. Ill always remember March 8, 2010 as the absolute worst day of my life, but that's a whole nother story. My parents both finally found stable jobs, and my grandma was a bit less abusive than before. Perhaps she was like that due to her stress from our family's situation before. Life kind of went back to how it was in 2008, simple and mostly blissful, aside from my emotional instability. It was a nice relief after 2009.

2011: Pretty decent year actually. Much like late 2010, things were pretty simple. I hung out with friends and did random kid stuff. I also turned 13, so my parents became much more lax with me than before, and i was allowed to do alot more things on my own. We moved to a different town in late 2011, which i really didn't like at first, but eventually got settled into our new home and made new friends. I met my best friend this year too! I also had my first kiss during the Spring.

2012: Awesome year. Made several new friends, and we did alot of fun (and stupid) stuff. Ill never forget the long afternoons and late nights just walking around town with my closest friends, doing whatever, yknow. It was simple, but great. I also successfully pursued my crush that year, and we dated for a short while.

2013: Oof. I dont really know. Early 2013 was much like 2012 but mid 2013 sucked ass. I suddenly came down with Hypochondria. May-August it was basically ""Im dying"" and i was constantly panicking. Yeah, for about 4 months things were terrible, but then I kind of came out of it in August. We moved again in late July, but honestly it was for the better. I think part of the reason i felt so much better is that we didnt live an hour from the nearest hospital now. I know, it was kind of dumb, but oh well. Late 2013 wasnt too bad. I still have Hypochondria to an extent, but not near as bad as mid 2013.

2014: I like to refer to 2014 as the ""Dog Days"" of my life because it was just so incredibly simple compared to the likes of 2013 and 2009. Go to school, play video games, hang out with my friends. That was my life. Had barely any chores, and I got my driver's liscense, so that was very nice. Got my first job in mid 2014 as well.

2015: A really awesome year. My self confidence shot up this year after playing on the Baseball team, and i became quite popular at my school. First time since 2008 that I didn't feel like a weird outcast among my peers.

2016: A very busy, but also pretty good year despite what many people experienced. Still popular at school, Took the hottest girl in my school to prom, endless adventures with my best friend, and graduated high school, threw a killer graduation party, and 3 months later started college. College was great too for the time, made alot of new friends and the classes were much better than i expected.

2017: Early 2017 was pretty awesome for the most part. Had a hell of alot of fun partying it up with my buddies at college, and i was taking some really good classes. But, come mid 2017, I fell out with my best friend. Honestly really took a toll on me, I loved him like a brother. Late 2017 honestly sucked hard. After getting in a bad situation with my girlfriend at the time, and breaking up, my mental health tanked again. Only good thing that happened in late 2017 is that I found a new best friend, who is still my best friend to this day.

2018: Its hard for me to describe this year. Its been a mixed bag of good and bad. I ended up making amends with my ex-girlfriend, but other than that, early 2018 sucked really hard. My hypochondria came back in force, and I ended up really depressed because of it. I had no energy, and my grades tanked, which of course, my parents were not happy about at all. I still partied when i felt up to it and had good times, but my mental health was the worst it has been since 2009. I even got sent home from work a few times because my anxiety would get so intense that i couldn't function. But, come late 2018, my mental health improved a bit and i picked up a couple hobbies. I even figured out how to stop a panic attack in its tracks. But, I ended up dropping out of college because for some reason since early 2018 it also became hard on my mental health. But, I hope 2019 can bring me some new and good things! 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My best years are 2008, 2012, and 2015-2016, and my worst years are 2009, 2013, and probably late 2017-early 2018.

I would say 2008, 2012, and 2015-16 are pretty close, I cant decide which one was the best. But, out of the worst, 2009 definitely takes 1st. There would probably have to be a nuclear war for me to have a year worse than 2009. Even though i had 2013 and late 2017-early 2018, they weren't consistently bad really, just had a few really bad parts. 2009 was just absolute jackshit through and through.

What were your best and worst years, and why were they good/bad?",01Jan2019,1
39,I've noticed today and yesterday when I wake up for the first couple hours in the morning I feel a lot of panic. I have no idea why it just kind of happens. It always makes me feel as though I'm on the edge of having just a complete breakdown it's so bad but I never have a breakdown because I realize that I'm feeling intense panic for no reason and that allows me to not let it affect me to the extent of breaking down. I remember a year ago or so I had a similar feeling almost daily in the morning as well but it was to the point where it did make me cry a couple times. I figured it was just do to me being extremely stressed out for a long period of time. The difference is I don't feel super stressed as of now I have nothing wrong though i am a bit worried because i have my next semester of college coming up in 2 weeks and my driving test in a week so I've been a little worried about that but I try not to think about it. ,01Jan2019,1
40,"I've been pondering lately that I might be a sociopath. I've never been very empathetic and I typically dislike people. My mom would describe me as tough because when I was a kid I was usually violent towards other kids. I used to lie and steal a lot for fun and never really felt remorse for it. While I get pretty good grades I'm very impulsive and often skip school, etc. 
This whole question went through my mind a year or so ago when my friends were on those gore sites, and everyone could barely watch the fairly tame videos but I could watch the beheadings and it wouldn't bother me. 
Are there any tests or evaluations I can do as I'd rather avoid talking to a professional?",01Jan2019,1

44,"I'm not very close to this person, but we went to high school together. She has been exhibiting some very concerning behaviors for a long time. Since high school (we're almost 4 years into college now), she has always verbally put herself down. She seems to have some unknown expectations of herself and of other people, because she gets upset very easily when you say something 'wrong'. For example, I once asked her why she was using Casio instead TI-84 and she thought I was judging her for being poor. (She is not poor.) I was at a party recently, and she very strongly implied to some of us in the group that she has harmed herself in the past. I didnt really say anything because I have no idea how to talk to her. At this same party, she became increasingly reserved and tried to leave early. She also told me she hasn't made any friends in college. I think she's been isolating herself and people can't reach her. A bunch of people from high school made an online chat group that we still continue to talk in. Whenever she felt bothered by a topic, even if it wasn't personally about her, she'd make an emotional post and temporarily leave. Whenever she hangs out with us, she always shares inappropriate personal information about herself or her family. One time, someone in the group was upset by one of her posts, and made some hurtful comments to her. My friend once again left the chat, but this time she never came back. Several people defended her and even invited her back. She hasn't changed since high school and it's worrying me. ",01Jan2019,1
45,"In 2018 I was suicidal. I tried to end my life at the very young age of 13 two times. I was hospitalized in an intensive outpatient program for 2 1/2 months, I survived and I’m no longer depressed. In 2018 I could not leave my house because my anxiety and ocd was so bad. I missed out in school so much I almost had to drop out or be behind a year. I went to therapy and I can now leave the house and I’m going into high school next year. I still struggle with loads of things and I still have trouble going anywhere but it’s managed and I’m getting stronger. Everyday is a struggle but I’m slowly getting better. I hope everyone who is having a hard time doesn’t give up, things will get better. Happy new year!",01Jan2019,1

47,"When my mother's grandmother died, I laughed, didn't feel upset at all and didn't try to comfort her, just laughed. 

Whenever my mother tries to talk to me about her problems, I just don't care at all

Once a girl was texting me about her dead cousin, I only pretended to care and watched porn as she was talking to me about her dead cousin. 

Somebody just called me crying because their alcoholic stepdad was verbally abusing them, once again I didn't give a shit, and tried to find a way out of the conversation. 

Whenever anybody comes to me with their problems, I just pretend to care because I know that's what i'm supposed to do, not because I actually care. 

Why don't I have any empathy? Is there something wrong with me? Is there a way I can develop empathy?",01Jan2019,1

49,"Here's a little of my theory of why this happened. When I was in grade 10 around 15 years old , I met this group of students through one of the smart kids in my class. Later did I find out that these kids were assholes . They would make fun of me and harass the crap.out of me . I was the third highest mark in the class apart from this student in second . Anyways , at the time I was very sensitive and they catfished me online pretending to be a girl. I believed it and when I found out the truth , I was suicidal ( even though that's kinda childish) . To deal with my loneliness I resorted to playing video games . Ever since then I usually played for 7 hours a day . My life went upsidedown from there on out . The smart kid who introduced me to these kids knew about it all along and didn't tell me . Do you think that this caused my video game addiction and how can I deal with it ?",01Jan2019,1
50,"After an attempt to drown myself in the bathtub 7 months ago, I was sent to a clinic, where I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I just don’t get it though, I mean I can see how the therapist came to his diagnosis, because even I can clearly tell the drastic changes in my mood and behavior. But couldn’t it be possible that I’ve gone through, and still am in some ways, the worst pain I have ever had to experience. And trust me when I say I’ve spent almost my entire life living as a human punching bag for scumbags dressed like little red riding hood or Prince Charming, and my hearts just to naive to see a the villain underneath their disguise. I’m just so beyond lost and I’m not sure I’m going to survive this. ",01Jan2019,1

52,"Before I start I just want to mention that I am a 15 year old male if that matters in this context, and I live in Canada. Around September I started having really bad depersonalization moments and really bad anxiety. I’ve always had anxiety all my life, but I am really good at hiding it and not letting it control me. But since September it has gotten out of control, especially the depersonalization. It is affecting my school and social life bad and I want help but I don’t know how to ask my mom. I feel weak and nervous whenever I think about telling my mom about my problems, which I have never done before. My mother is amazing and caring and would definitely get me the help I need, but I feel like it would change everything; the way she sees me, the way she interacts with me and that is what is stopping me. I have tried reaching out to kids help phone but they did not help at all. Please leave me suggestions on how to talk to my mom about getting me help for this, I would really appreciate it.",01Jan2019,1
53,"Also hopefully it doesn't sound cliché. I'm 22 y/o male and I just went to a new years party with my girlfriend (it was her work party) and I just hated every single thing about it. Idk if it's the social part that bothers me the most but it feels uncomfortable to me the entire time. I find myself just not wanting to talk to people because of their behavior. Everyone is either drinking or high. But the weird part to me is that I kind of enjoy both of those things from time to time (almost never in a social setting though) myself so I feel hypocritical for disliking people for doing things I enjoy.  I think my greater problem is that I hate groups. I love one on one time with people. I could do it all day, but with literally any more than one other person I feel like shit. (Immediate family excluded).

 Also my girlfriend was really drunk the whole time and I found it really weird that she was a little bit of a ""party animal"". we have been dating for 6 months  and she always seemed like she didn't care for that at all. Now I'm not saying shes a bad person for enjoying those things I just found it surprising to be around my girlfriend while she brags about how many shots shes taken after 6 months of not really hearing anything like that.

I'm just afraid that I'm socially inept for life or something and Its occasionally difficult to deal with. I also feel like I'm kind of an antagonist with the whole situation because I feel like I should just be okay with that stuff but for some reason situations like this really keep upsetting me and I can't shake it. 

I don't really think anyone needs to take much time to reply to this it just felt good to put it somewhere where I know someone heard that I'm feeling that way. ",01Jan2019,1
54,"Every day I wake up and do that same thing,  before I even wake up I'm a failure. I set a goal and immediately fail  it, wake up at a time that resembles a fucking human. It's because I'm  lazy, apathetic to that world around me, to busy escaping into videos  games to witness the world around me passing me by. I can't but blame my  mother, she beat me, she made me feel like nothing, I was little kid and she made sure I felt like nothing and that I thought I was nothing. Helpless.  


I'm  afraid to share anything genuine with anyone, even here. I'm afraid  that if this is ever discovered by anyone I will be judged, I'm not just  a machine unaffiliated by emotional torment or anything else. I feel  like a robot, every day I wake up, sit down and escape into another  world, a video game because I'm afraid to deal with, to express what I've felt inside for so long. Afraid someone will discover my thoughts and hurt me.

I want way  to improve, I feel lost, I've tried reaching out but where I am  (geographically) there is no one and nowhere I can go to get help, I've  tried reaching out to a family member but the person denied the accusation and called me a liar. Saying my mother  was many things but she never hurt me, she is only out for herself. I  think I'll write down a traumatic experience a day and see if it helps  me getting over everything, I'll start with my daughter I guess.  


I  don't even remember how old I was, I think I was 18 when she was born  and 20 when she died. I remember blowing off a visit with her for my  fiance because my fiance had just got back from a vacation with her family, even now I know that if had visited her, she wouldn't have been put to bed so soon, she would have never went  in the toy box, I would have lingered longer than I should have like I  normally do. I remember my ex saying I should sit down for what she was  going to tell me, I refused and told her to tell me. ""She's dead"", I  remember losing all control of my legs, people say it's like being  punched in the stomach, my stomach was fine, I just fell like in that  moment my body had refused to do anymore. I remember going upstairs and telling her my daughter was dead, I remember desperately trying to find a ride to a place I wasn't  familiar to see the only person who truly mattered, to young, to dumb, to late. I remember asking for the location of my daughter, taking the elevator and the walk to her room that felt  like forever, pausing at the ICU desk looking at her door trying to  pull together whatever I could to go in there, looking at her, touch her  and feeling how cold she was, she was on some kind of life support,  they let us bath her one last time, to hold her when it came time to  take her off life support. I remember the funeral, I remember looking at  her in her tiny casket, just staring at her. I think I'm going to stop  here, it's \[Redacted\] and I need to go to sleep to fail all over again.

I have stopped my sessions because I feel like I dont need the guidance anymore and I can apply the things I have learned. Part of my depression is just feeling really bad bout myself. I bring this up because often I have a awesome day with family, friends and my boyfriend but then later feel really sad. I realize I had a good day and tell myself over and over ""why are you feeling like this your day was good and was spent with great people"". I am acknowledging my day was good but I feel like something inside me is not realizing that and makes me feel sad. I'm always willing to go back to therapy if needed and was thinking about it, definitely do not mind going back but I wanted to hear others opinions and advice and input as to what might be, input as to what I can do in the meantime.

59,"Okay I guess I’ll just start by saying on my birthday in 2018 I brought a knife to bed with me and held it to my throat and heart and sliced my arms and I guess yeah I was trying to kill myself. After that I started working harder with my therapist and my extremely mentally unstable sister was brought across the country to a facility to help her mental health. It simultaneously of course helped me too because trying to overcome depression and anxiety brought on by rape is a very difficult task when your older sibling is also suicidal (I’m 16 she’s 18).

Anyway those were the best months of my life when she left. I’ve never felt so free and able to garner the attention towards my mental health from my parents which I always felt I lacked. Well she came home last week. I was already going downhill a bit because of some other things that happened and honestly probably also a seasonal thing but seeing her again didn’t help that at all. Of course my parents were all “oh she’s so much better” and “we’re so happy she’s home” and yeah okay I’m happy my sister is home too but she’s barely any better. Just yesterday we were sitting in a restaurant around a bunch of people and I made a stupid sarcastic remark when she asked me about a football game (it was stupid but it was something that I do all the time). Well she lashed out at me and even slapped me. She literally hit me in public. My parents passed it off said it’s no big deal. They don’t see what I see. That hit wasn’t just it. She’s not able to live normally or with this family it just can’t happen. And of course I feel bad and everything but they just can’t see that this isn’t best for ANYBODY.

Now about suicide (yay), I have a very bad habit just like many of my fellow anxiety and depressioners. When I feel hopeless I tend to go to websites like lostallhope.com that talk all about suicide and different methods and honestly it’s starting to grow on me. I’ve described these feelings and what I’ve done to my therapist but she is telling me it’s something that will pass but I feel in my heart that it’s a really much bigger problem. Last night my body just couldn’t handle the frustration any more and I had a full out cry for help and I woke up my mom and told her pretty much everything I just said: my sister is making me feel like this and blah blah and this family can’t handle it and we’re falling apart and I feel like I can’t take another day of it. And I think you can guess what she said. “It’s okay, I know things seem bad to you, but to me it’s only getting better. Go back to sleep now you must be tired.” Of course it’s paraphrased but that’s what happened. 

I don’t know what to do guys. This is my first time posting here. I’m suicidal and all I thought about when we were counting down to 2019 was “is this the year I’m actually going to do it. Am I going to live until 2020?” And those are scary to me. I don’t like thinking about it but it just keeps happening.

I’m sorry nobody I expect will read this all and I don’t blame you. I think I really needed to vent and maybe also find some supportive words or helpful people but I understand. Have a nice year everybody.",01Jan2019,1
60,"I know this woman. I dont like her at all. Shes two faced. Doesnt parent her kids. Ignores one kid and over spoils another. Shes also mooching off one of my best friends. Id like her a lot more if she would be a better parent and actually pitch in to the bills she uses. 

My issue is that I have bipolar disorder and borderline with severe anxiety. Fun stuff. Ive worked my butt off to get to the point I am now. And in pretty high functioning most of the time. She claims to have ptsd and says she manic. 

I have a bachelors in psychology and own the dsm5. No where (yes I may have missed it) have i seen mania as an only symptom. She claims shes never been depressed. I know thats a lie because shes been sent to hospitals for threatening suicide in arguments with her boyfriend. 

My issue though is I spend a lot of time around her. I see that shes high a lot. Not just weed but pills and possibly meth and/or heroin. I can smell the drugs sometimes and others she cant even stay awake and is sluring her words. Plus she looks like she's 60 and shes only 40. And weighs ten pounds soaking wet. 

When she doesn't get her way around the house. Or is asked to pitch in with money or cleaning she freaks the fuck out. Like screaming and breaking shit. Threats and the whole 9 yards. Even upsetting my friends neighbors. 

I realized already that I cant help her because she refuses to be helped at this time. But how can I see it from another perspective so I can at least be more empathetic. To her? ",01Jan2019,1

For me Mental Health is all about ‘**the way of expression’** if you can express properly then *Son, you’re on the right track*. Being expressive does not always mean to be an extrovert but what I mean by ‘expressive’ is speaking what you feel.    

So, in 2019 if you want to stabilise and then improve your Mental Health then you need to keep a proper check on your emotions. Now, I’ll be mentioning 6 emotions to take care of in 2019 to improve your Mental Health and also how to improve your mental health.

1. Hypocrisy 
2. Jealousy
3. Power of Acceptance 
4. Compassion
5. Understanding EGO! 
6. Sense of Belonging. 

&amp;#x200B;

Take a read guys, as its important for all of us to understand these emotions to improve our Mental Health.

63,"So I'm on Seroquel and Lithium for Bipolar and I stopped taking them both for two days and I'm pretty sure I have some crazy insight in thats short time, or I could just be wrong.

Firstly, I'm a recovering addict. I did a lot of hard drugs and some days I just felt straight up stupid and my mental functioning seemed like it was maybe 50% of what it was before drugs. I had memory issues with lithium when I first got on it but it went away after changing to the extended release version. So anyway, after stopping the lithium, it seemed like I was actually able to function like I used to be able to and I was remembering things much more clearly from further back in time than I could before. So I'm pretty sure that a good portion of that is being caused by the lithium. The memory issues are back now that I'm taking it again.

Second, I threw up and felt extremely sick after being off my seroquel. I couldn't sleep even after taking 3x my prescribed dose of trazadone that I don't ever take anwyay. I was also coughing up blood. I tried to get off of seroquel before because it makes me extremely hungry at night, and they put me on abilify and I had these symptoms after taking it so I assumed it was because of the abilify, but now I'm fairly certain it's actually from the lack of seroquel. This means I could actually maybe do abilify if I taper off the seroquel.

Finally, I started seeing things. I saw the outlines of people in the dark. I could feel the presence of things in the room with me. I could see invisible people, not actually see them, but I knew exactly where they were standing and exactly what they looked like I just couldn't see them. Hard to explain. I used to be afraid of the dark as a kid, and as a teen an adult too for that matter, for this reason. After being on seroquel I can't remember having this fear anymore. The dark was just the dark. There were no more creatures of people or presences waiting in it. But after I stopped taking the pills, this came back, as well as my ability to remember it happening in the past.

Anyway, thanks for reading. If anyone could provide any insight or anything, especially as to the last part about seeing things and what that could be I would appreciate it. Thank you.",01Jan2019,1
64,"i don't know if this really belongs here, but i wanted to space to share it without disrupting the communal peace.

i almost hung myself on december 11th &amp; i suddenly stopped because i lost the driving force. i realized that i didn't actually want to end my life. and whether other people who are similarly suicidal encounter the same revelation or not isn't of primary relevance to this post. i just wanted to share.

but it finally hit me in that moment, how the foremost motivation of my suicidality was never to just make it all stop. it was more along the lines of what i deserved. like i needed to just get rid of myself.

making it all stop just wouldn't make sense. i actually enjoyed myself as a person.

for background, i am a transgender female, and over the last few months i've made unprecedented progress towards transitioning, my standards at least lol. and i came to actually appreciate and enjoy myself, my personality, body image, mannerisms, etc. yet my suicidal cravings wouldn't subside, and i couldn't make sense of them then. and so things deterioated. until i finally took the time to write out all my letters in anticipation of ending it all, for the first time. before it was more of a cursory scribble. like ""sorry so so sorry not your fault mom"" type stuff.

and i had my funeral songs picked out, and i actually poured a little heart into my preparations, and then i was finally just standing there, making sure i had my balance before i pushed the chair beneath me, &amp; i just couldn't. i just didn't feel it anymore. instead, i felt more of this bit of peace that i could simply walk away with and it was unlike any of the other times, because for once it was clear to me *why* i didn't want to die. and that was because i've already begun transitioning, and idk, i just kinda liked myself too much to go.

so in the following days, i had what i believe was hypomania/mania. like a lot of high energy screaming at my dog and running up and down the stairs until my chest hurt and slamming doors because it felt funny and pouring sparkling champagne over my head and giggling to myself and all this batshit weird stuff that i've never thought of. and feeling like i had unlocked some sort of abilities, like i could manipulate people's behaviors with my mind if i thought REALLY hard about it. 

though it was very rapid cycling. twice a day, around 3-4ish and in the evening. back &amp; forth between ""up"" and ""down, down"", for a few days. 

and then after that must've been the ""crash"", because i lost track of time and just got super muted and i thought that i was either separated from my original universe, or i was a ghost that died and had to remember how i did. and i've never entertained any of these things before, or become so out of touch with making sense.

its just all so fuckin unexpected. i've never experienced any mental illness outside the realm of depression, anxiety, etc. before this.

i'm looking to schedule a visit to my psychiatrist once my health coverage plan has been renewed. and i KNOW that i've been leaping to conclusions, but it's how i've been able to come to terms with everything &amp; get by until further attention.

but over the past few days it's been a lot easier. a lot more of me crying the snot out of my eyes until my head hurts. which is better than a lot of things, apparently. 

right now is better than ever. and i've never wanted so badly to simply persist.

thank you, so much for reading.

69,"Hi, I’m a 20 year old male and after about 3 years of doctors visits I was finally diagnosed with rapid cycling cyclothymia about 2 years ago now. Ever since my diagnosis of cyclothymia I have attended regular CBT sessions and tried multiple different medications and multiple different doses of those medications. Finding the right medication, and the right balance of that medication has been a difficult process. As some of you may know cyclothymia is a bipolar related disorder, as in it’s essentially bipolar light with a few variations. You might think oh yeah it should be easy enough to just use bipolar meds to treat it then, right? Yeah no, unfortunately it’s not quite that easy. Because bipolar meds are made for people with far more intense mood shifts, which frankly I can’t imagine how people with bipolar disorder feel because trust me cyclothymia is hell. But anyways let’s get back on topic, the medication balancing. It’s been an issue, any dosage of medication that’s been high enough to eliminate my symptoms so far has left me feeling like a zombie, so what I’ve been stuck with is lower doses that don’t eliminate my symptoms but do seem to help some. Unfortunately it doesn’t help quite enough with some of my more distracting manic symptoms, which is where the increased sex drive comes in. There are days where literally any decently attractive woman I come into contact with immediately becomes the object of some sexual fantasy, and as a college student this is ridiculously difficult to work around. I have to go out and be around a lot of people, and I should be concentrating on other things but when I’m manic even with the meds it feels like it’s impossible to concentrate on anything other than sex. There are times when it gets bad enough I would do literally almost anything to have sex, and I’ve had a few people take advantage of that fact in the past. Anyways like I said the meds do help me restrain myself at least physically, but mentally is an entirely different story and it’s really starting to affect my academic performance, not to mention making me feel like a total creep. Some of these girls are my friends and the fact that I think about them in these ways makes me hate myself, please anyone who can suggest anything to help do so.",01Jan2019,1
70,"Hi, first time poster on this sub. New to Reddit, really. My account age shows that.  

I'm not sure if this is the right place to post. I'm looking for advice, and everyone's opinion. Please if you think you can help, share it. I am desperate at this point.  

   

TLDR; suffer from  memory loss, anxiety, emotional numbness and what i think is dissociation. please help  

  

A short backstory. I'm 19, male. Moved country at 8. Parents divorced at 9. first Step father died at 11 (I may have been 9-11) I saw him on the couch before my mum could protect me from seeing. First step mother was abusive, mentally. Manipulation, verbal abuse and the sorts. My second step father has been my main father figure. I didn't see or talk to my biological dad for years (roughly age 12 to 17). Always struggled with mental health: anxiety and stress mainly, but depression for a period of time and now dissociation, since about 13 years of age. I seem to always feel numb and struggle to show emotion.  

   

Now on to the main reason of my post.  

 I've been struggling with what I think is dissociation for a very long time and bad anxiety which still haunts me from time to time, but is not always crippling as the (possible) dissociation is.  

For as long as I can remember (hah) I have had a **terrible** memory. It's so bad sometimes, that I will forget something, and have no recollection of it until something happens that makes me realize it. I believe this is due to Dissociation of some kind.   

For example, not long ago I watched Mr Robot. I watched all 3 available seasons and thoroughly enjoyed it. I decided to re-watch it a few days ago and upon getting to S2E6, I cannot remember ever watching this episode, If you had asked me about any other part of the show, I could have told you most parts about it, main events, plot twists... you know, the stuff anyone would normally remember without really trying to commit it to their memory. Upon starting this episode though, It was like discovering an entirely new episode that had never been released. It was scary, as I don't see how I could have watched the rest of the show and remembered most of it, but omitted a whole 45 minute episode from memory.  

You may be thinking that I could have easily skipped over the episode without realizing and just made a simple mistake as anyone would. I thought that too... but since I was a kid, I have always been methodical and logical in my thoughts and actions, I take notice of episode numbers and follow the episode count from 1 to 10, and if I had skipped from episode 5 to 7, it would have bothered me greatly. I believe I would have noticed it, even subconsciously (as I have done before many times).  

This is not an isolated instance either. Things like this have been happening more and more often. I seem to go about life on autopilot, not realizing that I've completely forgotten to do something until much later... when I find there's a glitch in my line of thinking.... *hold on a second, I could have sworn I brought my cigarettes upstairs with me, as I* **always** *do*.  

I have once gone to the doctor, checked in, waited for my doctor, walked into their office and then completely forgot why I even made the appointment and drove there. It's like I'm living life on autopilot, physically and mentally present, but not really making *conscious* decisions.  

  

Even writing this post is hard, I keep zoning out and ""stepping into my mind"", almost lost in thought... but not really thinking about anything. I've forgotten most of what I was going to say.  

  

I once booked an appointment with a ""free counselor"" of sorts, something my government offers to young people (16-24 I believe) as a means to get advice or a recommendation to see a psychiatrist if more extensive evaluation and support is needed.  

Upon seeing him, i described my memory issue (and anxiety and stress) and after a short discussion he suggested we try breathing exercises. closing my eyes in a new environment with someone I only met a short 30 minutes ago is extremely anxiety inducing, and he was upset that I commented that I was uncomfortable with it. It was clear that I suffer from anxiety, and two separate questionnaires using the DepressionAnxietyStress system showed i scored on the extreme end for anxiety and stress. I don't understand why he was frustrated with me. I had to cancel all other appointments with him. I didn't feel safe.  

Anyway I'm rambling. What I took away from the hour session is that he said my memory issue was due to an ""attention"" problem. I just wasn't paying enough attention.... although I can look people in the eyes and intently listen (when I don't feel anxious)... I sometimes ""lose consciousness"" of sorts and well... dissociate. It leads to me forgetting entire parts of the conversation. I don't ever get asked to ""pay attention"" or ""look at me when I speak to you"", but i do seem to step away from reality sometimes.  

  

It is for that reason I'm writing here tonight. I believe I may be suffering from Dissociation. It could easily be caused by the traumatic events I experienced while I was younger, and it seems to explain the symptoms I've been experiencing.

71,"I’m a 20 year old male and I was diagnosed with rapid cycling cyclothymic disorder about 2 years ago now. Unfortunately balancing my medication has been an issue, as most of the medications used to treat cyclothymia are bipolar meds at a lower dosage. Finding the right dosage has been a struggle, as any dosage I’ve tried so far that’s eliminated my symptoms has left me feeling like a zombie, and anything lower doesn’t fully eliminate my symptoms or only eliminates some symptoms. One of my more distracting manic symptoms is unfortunately hyper sexuality, and honestly it is easily the most difficult for me to cope with on a personal level. There are times when all I can think about is sex, and it happens often enough that it impedes my ability to function. As a college student I have to go out and be around people, I have to go to class even when I’m not really functional. But going to class when so much as looking at a woman sparks wild sexual fantasy’s is exhausting, and it makes me feel disgusted with myself. I’m friends with a lot of these women, and I hate myself for looking at them this way. It makes me feel like a disgusting perv but I literally can’t stop. Sometimes I take a double dose of my meds just to zombify myself for a while so I do t have to think about it, but that obviously doesn’t help the actual issue.

72,"In many ways I had a great year. I celebrated my 2 year anniversary with my boyfriend back in March. I went on my first ever REAL holiday (a week in Alicante). I made new friends. I settled into my first job. Went to Brighton pride to see BRITNEY BITCH. I started to learn to drive. Found out I am going to be an aunty! I was lucky enough to spend my birthday in AMSTERDAM with my amazing boyfriend. 

I know who ever is reading this is like wtf your  year sounds great, don't be so ungrateful. 

I'm not belittling all the good things that 2018 gave to me, I am so unbelievably grateful for them all. But all in all in 2018 I've never felt as ALONE in all my life. Yes, I'm surrounded by some amazing people like my mum, who has honestly been my rock in a number of subliminal ways even with out herself knowing. I've an amazing boyfriend who would go to the ends of the earth for me and I don't appreciate him enough. 

If I had to explain 2018 I say its that feeling when you're trying to speak to someone and everything just cancels out the sound of your voice. Everyone is speaking over you but no one was really listening in the first place anyways so what does that matter. 2018 felt like I was suffocating, right in front of people and they walked on. I felt alone. I felt alone when I was surrounded by people who I thought where my friends. People who were my friends for years. But as soon as someone more interesting pops up I am nothing to them, I'm just someone to talk about but not to. 2018 taught me to not rule anything out. My best friend thought it was funny and a joke to spread rumours about me that I was cheating on my boyfriend and when confronted just said **no one knows who you are anyways not like anyone cares**. I know it sounds stupid just a petty fight but those words stuck with me, I know I should let go and that she doesn't matter. 

September 2018, was when I was suppose to begin uni, however my grades didn't POP and I am back at college repeating. I find it hard to stay motivated and even harder to stay concentrated. Majority of my ""friends"" are away to uni and spread out all over the Uk so that makes it harder to maintain healthy steady friendships. **I miss my friends**. Even the shitty ones. Ive found it hard to make new friends, FACT. I feel like I'm on the outside and just looking in on everyone else. Kinda get the feeling that they just hang around with me out of pity and that they just don't like me. 

My nana has always been a constant in my life. I used to stay over at her house with my older sister and go there after school some days. I hate myself for ever complaining about going to her house because there wasn't wifi.Although any time I did spend there I loved it. My nana is so kind to everyone. She has a pure soul. It breaks my heart that 2018 was the year that my nana would not recognise who I am anymore. My nana is still herself in a number of ways but she doesn't remember her family anymore and it hurts so bad. I went to her house after work by myself one day and she said she thinks she might recognise my face from walking in the street but had no idea who I am. It broke my heart.

I rarely get invited out. ( I know I've turned this into a pity feast of me feeling sorry for myself but this is what goes on in my head but just in text) It's a common thing for many young people. You're sitting at home just chilling on you're phone seeing that all you're friends are out but you're invite is lost in the mail. BUT WHY. You haven't fallen out with these people, you're all still on good terms, you'll have a laugh with each other if you see one another. So why don't they want to spend time with you. Am I just not a thought, maybe they've just forgotten about me or they are just sick of me...

After a while these little things start to build up. And as reluctant as I am to say it, it's had a tole on my mental health. I feel unwanted. To the point where I even question if my own boyfriend even likes me or if he's just being there for me as he can see that he is all I've got. 

I spent my New Years eve in my bed watching youtube and Netflix. I asked my friend if she had anything sorted for NYE a few days prior and she goes ""no! please give me plans"" so I give her two options. She doesn't reply. I've already bought my ticket. But that's okay because my other friends is going and its fine I can just hang out with her. But I felt like a burden so I sold my ticket 2 hours before I was suppose to leave. I said to myself its okay because no one will care if I don't go out, and they didn't they were just like ""okay sweet"". So as I am chilling in my house just with my family on NYE I see a snapchat story (from my friend who ignored my offer) and it kind of hurt me. Again like I wasn't even a thought, she just got a better offer and that was that. No sorry. No invitation for her new plans. But sure no one knows who I am anyways and its not like anyone cares. 

I am trying to make the best of my 2019, I've got a youtube channel that I know I get criticised for by people in my town but honestly I don't care because I love filming and editing the videos. I don't care if I don't get 100,000,000 views. It gives me something fun to do. I've applied to University to start in September 2019 and I am praying that I will get in( the universities are far away from my home so I am hoping I can start fresh!) 2019 I will make it my mission for you to be my year. I hope you bring me a lot of happiness because that is my biggest aspiration. Happy New Year and Thank you to anyone who took their time to read. I appreciate it so much.",01Jan2019,1
73,"So basically I'm often having a hard time urinating when either others are around/I feel uncomfortable or when feeling annoyed by specific sounds. I don't know what's causing this, but first off I can't use pissoirs (or only when nobody is around, I'm somewhat hidden and I can hear if somebody were to approach) and even bathroom stalls can be tricky. When I feel uncomfortable by it being cramped or there are many people inside or it's too loud there, but also when it's not a closed room. Those are all things that are causing me stress. Also when I'm going somewhere with others I often can't go to the toilet, because I'm feeling stressed about this being my only ""chance"" and needing to do it in that time frame.

As of two years ago I have been feeling like I'm losing my capacity to integrate information into my long-term memory.  Often my days feel like a fog that blend together.  I am continuing to do well in my university studies but feel as if I have nothing important to contribute to class discussions, as I often cannot recall the name of an author, study, concept to even attempt contribution.  As well, social interactions and social anxiety have dominated a lot of my mind which does not help (i.e., thinking others don't like me, not having close friends yet, awkward in social conversations and feeling as if it is obvious).  Other background information that can help provide an answer: I am 26, F, recently moved to an entirely new province (Canadian ehhh!), began smoking marijuana daily (once or twice a day usually) via a small one-hitter as of a year ago to help with my depression and to relax after a long day.  I was concerned it was the marijuana use but I feel that the amount I take is quite low and should not have such a large impact, but I could be wrong.

79,"How can I make use of a therapist when it seems like I need to dissect and understand myself on my own to begin with? I can't, I've read autistic people can have problems identifying/understanding their own emotions so I assume it's related to that. But something I also barely understand is how I physically have problems conveying complex thoughts into spoken word. I could never spontaneously say everything I've typed so far. It's like every conversation is a class speech and I would need a lot of preparation and notes to come up with much. I literally have trouble with basic conversation, so it drives everyone away. Some therapists and a lot of acquaintances think I'm normal (just weird and quiet) because I can say short things easily or things I know readily. Anything complex or requiring my memory takes much longer and seems impossible, especially with the person staring at me waiting.  Even though therapists/job coaches know I'm autistic they act like I'm capable of everything everyone else is - just that I'm bad at socializing. Yes I'm bad at socializing but it's due to a lot of factors I barely understand. A job coach suggested teacher as a job, which is insanely far off from what I would be good at that it's depressing and makes me feel like more of a failure.  

For a long time I've also had bad anxiety/depression. Now it's mostly anxiety doing a lot of things, with sensory problems on top of that. A therapist I started seeing a while ago had me take one of those short questionnaires about anxiety. He told me I don't have anxiety according to that. Because I haven't had trouble sleeping for the past several weeks and don't worry about things most days. Except when I thought about it more my anxiety is very situational, and since I have no job and stay in the comfort of my house all the time I hadn't had much anxiety. It's hard for me to think of everything off the top of my head there too. But I think I must have anxiety even though he made me question it. When I tried to say something in a group conversation recently (very rare for me) I found myself shaking after. If I have minor events going on I lay in bed stressing about them -  I stress about every minor thing, let alone big things. If I'm thinking of applying to a job I completely obsess over it, like hours of research so I know what it would be like because not knowing causes me huge amounts of anxiety. For entry level things like working at a store. I get a lot of anxiety if I don't know exact details about new things.  

Probably typed too much already, I guess just venting. But it seems like there's no hope since I can't communicate any of my problems in person. I had self harmed for almost 10 years with no help or therapy, and now that I have the courage/self awareness to get help it feels like I'm in an alternate universe where none of that happened because no one's taking me seriously. It seems like I need to show them my extensive scarring which would probably explain more than I could. ",01Jan2019,1

I'm wondering if I suffer from sort sort of sociopathy or narcissistic disorder. I typically don't feel empathy for others unless it's involved with guilt. I generally prefer the wellbeing of others, but don't particularly care farther than the superficial. It's always bothered me, since i noticed when i was younger that it didn't really bother me that my grandmother died. I just sort of waited for my mom to finish telling me so i could un-pause my movie.   


It feels sort of gross to speak it aloud. It's not that I'm malevolent- I just feel blank. I also feel that most interactions that I have feel rehearsed, and like i am putting on an act.

83,"My mood has and still does change very rapidly. My emotions are either so muted to the point where I can barely recognize them or they're very intense. Anyways, throughout my entire life I've feel like I've been able to control my emotions better than average, but I do occasionally have very intense outbursts of anger, happiness, etc. For example, a couple days ago I went from thinking about how I was going to kill myself to calm and kind of happy in about 5 seconds. There was no reason, it just happened. Sometimes I'll get super angry over something small, like not being able to sit in the front seat of the car, I'll throw something or just yell really loud and immediately I'll be fine. Most of the time I don't know how I feel at all, whether I like a movie or a girl or anything really. I've been like this for as long as I can remember. Over time my emotions have felt more and more muted and my mood can go from intense emotions to calm faster and faster. I'm 16 and male by the way, and maybe this is normal, I'm growing up, but I don't see other people my age have such muted emotions and intense short outbursts. I think due to my childhood, which wasn't traumatic and I'm willing to type it out if anyone is curious, I suppress my emotions a lot. I feel like in general I suppress them well and they're really muted, but when something is really intense I just can't suppress it, but when I calm down just a little bit I can. I don't know how well I described it, and maybe this is normal, but idk.",01Jan2019,1

86,"I (18M) have been diagnosed with multiple anxiety problems, the most notable one is GAD (generalized Anxiety Disorder) and sometimes its crippling. The weirdest things give me horrible anxiet some examples being; Mustard yellow, Lime green, and different shades of bright green that fall between yellow and green. Now keep in mind there are more serious things that give me EVEN worse anxiety, like loud voices, taller people approaching me, and not feeling like I'm enough for anyone. 

But I'm asking mostly about the first ones...why in the world would a COLOR have this much power over how I feel. It's just a color minding it's own business, why do I have such an oversion to it? I hate feeling this way, and I'm terrified to tell my therapist, because im afraid he wouldn't take it seriously, (hes a new therapist, I literally had my first appt with him the other week). 

Allow me to describe the exact feeling such colors give me;

- I feel like I need to put as much distance between me and the color as possible, when I see it. 

- I feel like I'm in danger when I see it.

- I get this pit in my stomach, and my throat tightens up.

- i have noticed I start to develop a cold sweat when i see it, being worn on a person. Like if someone is wearing a lime green shirt I get very nervous

I really dont think I'm crazy, or have undiagnosed mental disorders that lead to this, but I am open to that idea, seeing as there really aren't many explanations for this...

Over the past 3-4 months (out of no where) I have experienced a few panic attacks and very high baseline anxiety. I also experienced mid-level depression that has fluctuated to periods of major depression. 

Essentially I've begun to get anxious in normal situations (talking to co-workers) and have experienced a strong diminishment in enjoyment of normal activities (my job, sports, etc). 

I believe that multiple life events in a short timeframe have created this situation (marriage, new home, new job - within a 12 month period). 

I'm looking for any experiences that high-functioning individuals have had on this anti-depressant. What I mean by ""high-functioning"" are just people that are actually working full-time jobs, have a supportive family, have friends and interests outside of work, are eating correctly, are working out and taking care of their bodies, are not abusing drugs, etc. As the research I have done suggests that SSRIs work significantly better for those in a high-functioning state (but experiencing a depressed/anxious disorder).

[January White](https://youtu.be/_tVnjOxunnY)

So let's press undo.
Rearrange the old and call it new-
January white.

Every calendar is playing the same old trick:
A year will disappear, replaced with counterfeit 
But we'll never really mind.

'cause if nothing else, we're given a little time
To change the game, a chance to redefine
Everything we are,
In our january white.

This year is a sealed envelope,
A culmination of hopes,
The lottery result that we've been crossing fingers for.

We could paint our walls a lighter shade of blue,
Or we could pack our bags and change the entire view
To january white.

If nothing else, we're given a little time
To change the heart in which we change our minds;
Our hourglasses turn.

This year is a sealed envelope;
With apprehensive hope
We brace for anything.
I swear, I understand that nothing changes that,
The past will be the past,
But the future is brighter than any flashback.

Well, we could let our guards down a little easier this time,
We could trust that when there's joy, there's nothing dark behind.
In spite of history,
Hope is january white.

This year, we're starting over again
Letter openers in hand,
A chance to take a chance.
I swear, I understand that the past will be the past,
And nothing changes that,
But the future is brighter than any flashback.

Hi guys. 
I just recently started posting here after being a reddit lurker for 5 years.

If you look at my two previous posts, you can kinda see what I’ve been dealing with. 

My sadness is prevalent in everything I do and it’s gotten to the point where I literally cannot function and have an extreme fear of people. Isolation has kept me safe but tortured me too. I don’t want to be sad anymore. I don’t want to feel like a ghost. I don’t want to die. I don’t want my impulsive decisions and not my own heart and mind to choose that for me. I’m tired of being terrified of my own demons and what they can do. I want to love people wholeheartedly without fear of it being reciprocated and be okay with it. 

—

So I’m choosing help, I’m choosing hope today.
I’m packing my bag and going to the behavioral hospital, seeking options to not feel like this anymore.
I have no idea what this really means..

I plan on kicking 2019’s ass. 
But I’m not going to lie to you, it’s really fucking hard.
I’m terrified. I want to die a little. I am alone and nobody knows.
But I choose hope. I choose living. I choose me. 

Thank you.

92,"Hey there,

since many months I suspect I have BPD. My mental health is getting worse, but I can't overcome myself to go see a doctor, even though there is one two streets away from home.

For about four years now I don't work and live of my parents money, as they provide food, shelter, clothing and much more for me, and I feel absolutely terrible about that. It makes me feel like a parasite.

I know that I will have to change things, because my parents wont be there forever and with an age of 21 years I have to stand on my own feet. I don't know what's blocking me from seeing a doctor, and I know that my *fear* is very irrational.

93,"I'll try kep this short. Over maybe the past year things have been rough, I moved to the next town, which is about 1 hour away. Now my friends said they would visit, and they did, once, for about 2 hours. Now they went out with each other all the time, but would never come see me or even invite me. I asked them plenty of times to come stay or have a night out, and they would either decline and declare themselves busy, or on multipke occasions say ""okay"", for them to just tell me ""can't come, feel like sh*t"" once i'd called them to see where they were on the day. It's been around 6 months or so since they visited, and I've lived here for 7. The funny part, is part of the group moved around themselves, even to places around 2 hours away (all further than I live), and they visit each other all the time. It's just passed new years, and I see photos of them on social networking sites, even people that don't go out very often were out, except little ol' me.

94,"Before the obligatory ""get a therapist/doctor"" replies come in, I'm working on that.  Unfortunately her GP was pretty worthless when we brought this up to her and told us ""it's probably normal but here's a generic list of therapists you can get in Google.""

My 10 year daughter has had some social anxiety her entire life.  For instance, team sports or friend building events have always been hard for her.  She had potential on soccer but would do things like kick the ball put of bounds on purpose instead of going for a goal.  She has had issues making friends in school and instead of playing with lots of kids, she holds 2 or 3 friends very close in an almost obsessive way.  

During any family events or outing, she starts out fine, but will completely shut down.  Act unhappy. Wont talk.  Completely closea inside of herself.  Wont eat at family dinners.

We have worked with her through her social quirks, but recently things have accelerated specifically at night.  About 2 times a week she will wake up and act ""possessed."" Howling screams. Throws herself out of her bed, bangs on doors, has locked herself in the bathroom once.  She flails and throws herself into walls...its very traumatic and scares the living hell out of her siblings.  I'm genuinely concerned shes going to hurt herself during these events. 

She refuses to talk to us about these events and acts normal the following morning.  She has told her mother that she is ""seeing things"" and that is what makes her act as she does. Not sure what all this is but we're exhausted and not sure how to find the right kind of help for her.

97,"I’ve observed this problem very frequently among my friends and even myself.

Elementary schoolers sit in one classroom all day and usually have to sit at a lunch table with their class as well. In the US that’s usually 20 kids, and in most cases kids will have one or two best friends, 6 close ones and then other acquaintances they play with once or twice. Statistically 7% of people have chronic depression (though 20% have a non chronic/situational case), 5% have attempted suicide, and 4% have a mental illness classed as severe such as a PD or delusional disorder. Around 10% engage in serious self harm such as cutting/burning but 30% have subclinical behaviors like picking scabs and biting skin around their nails. Again chronic cases are around 6%. So that’s 1 or 2 kids. They feel isolated and often have to deal with ignorance and often teasing.

Middle schoolers move classes and can choose lunch tables to sit at. They can make friends with their entire grade (300 kids in the US). 5% is 15 instead of 1 and 10% is 30. So if you have 8 close friends they can all be dealing with the same issues as you. Problem is they encourage and romanticize it and it becomes part of your identity, so it becomes very hard to recover without feeling less than or like you’ve lost a part of yourself.",01Jan2019,1

___________________


I've suffered from depression since about 13 years old, at about 15 heavy social anxiety kicked in, and I had my first psychotic break at 16 which was also my first ever stay in a psychiatric hospital. After several diagnoses, starting with depression with psychotic symptoms, I was diagnosed Schizoaffective sub type depressive at age 19. From 19-21 I spent more time in psychiatric hospitals than out of them, finally after a suicide attempt at age 21 I decided to take my meds seriously and stay on them.


Things got better from there, although far from perfect, despite no psychotic breaks voices constantly harassed me still, social anxiety made it hard to even go see a movie in theaters with friends, and depression caused me to self harm on many occasions. Then last year (2018) at the age of 28 I discovered cannabis, commonly known as weed, I decided to smoke it one time with my roommate and found the voices went away. After experimenting with it further I found my depression was no longer as crippling nor bouts of it didn't last as long. Even when not high, as long as I had smoked once in the past 3 days or so, I found I could even be more sociable and things like theaters and shopping in crowded stores was now tolerable (still not perfect, but I didn't feel like I was going to die anymore either).  


I just wanted to share my experience that has made life so much easier on me and has given me hope for having an actual future with things like actually having a significant other one day. Again, if you decide to try to self medicate with cannabis **please** do your research first and proceed with caution, it doesn't help everyone and for some people may make matters worse.",01Jan2019,1

122,"I could really use some advice or thoughts. My sister (29) lives in Nevada, which is pretty much across the country from me. She struggles pretty severely with paranoia, very strange emotional outbursts, and delusions. She’s been hospitalized before about 8 years ago, and she did so well then. But as soon as she left she didn’t follow any of the suggested treatments and she went right back. 

Her and I are somewhat close. She calls me every day. I was able to convince her to go back to therapy and for the two months she was in therapy she had a lot fewer panic attacks or emotional outbursts. But then they switched therapists on her and despite my best efforts to prepare her to work with the new therapist she was assigned, she freaked out and stopped going after her third session with the new therapist.  

She has a major freak out just now, screaming about her roommate stealing things.  I can’t keep doing this with her, but she has no one else. She’s been cut off from my family since she was 16 and my family has a lot of other things going on they need to deal with. So there won’t be any support there. She cut off all her friends long ago. I’m it. And I’m at the end of my rope. 

Ideally I would like to move her to my state and work with her more directly to commit to therapy. But there are two things stopping me. One, she takes a lot- the second I give her money or don’t set boundaries things get even worse. Second, She won’t move here, partly because she knows I’ll keep working to get her I to therapy and also because she likes the excitement of Vegas. 

I’ve thought about flying down there, but I’m just not sure what to do when I get there. 

I’m stuck in this constant cycle of she does well for a bit, then has a major crises, and I’m the only person who can sit here and watch while she goes through this crises which usually ends up with her moving which is a huge financial recommitment from me. The one time I refused to financially support her moving she ended up homeless so now I pay the landlord directly wherever she’s moving to. 

She is on Medicare, and is able to get welfare so she can at least get some food. So I know she’s good there. She hops from job to job and easily gets new ones (she either gets fired or paranoid someone at the job is out to get her so she leaves). She generally pays her own rent. I help when she’s short or usually to put a down payment on a place. 

Ultimately this cycle of freak out, crises, rash decisions once every month or so ... it just isn’t sustainable. I just don’t know what to do next. ",01Jan2019,1
123,"Hello everyone, I've never been on this subreddit before, but I am intrigued about myself and my mental health. The reason I have decided to post on here is because I'm not sure if I was experiencing psychosis. I wanted to ask your opinion on it.

So I was diagnosed with OCD from the age of 8 years old, but I always show OCD tendencies from younger than 8 years old.

I have always been into cartoons - Japanese ones, American ones, French ones, etc. This is embarrassing to say, but I find some cartoon characters attractive. Like, even ore attractive than some real people.

So when I was on only 20mg of Prozac (an anti-depressant) I started getting these really strange thoughts about the cartoon characters. I was convinced that they didn't like my mum for some reason. Basically I thought the cartoon characters (mainly the attractive ones) had real emotions and had a dislike for my mother and sometimes me - I thought they were better than anyone. Now these thoughts did scare me, but I honestly thought that these cartoon characters had real emotions. It was scary.

Without medication, I'm like this. Even a small dosage of medication doesn't work for me.

Thankfully now I'm on 60mg of Prozac and 5mg of Aripiprazole and I do feel better. These thoughts only sometimes come into my head, but they don't feel that real, but sometimes they do.

So do you think it was just severe OCD or psychosis?",01Jan2019,1
124,"I genuinely have no idea, I went to see a professional near enough 6 years ago, freaked out at what they wanted to talk about so didn't go back after two appointments which in hindsight was a really dumb move. 

I feel like I'm two different people. On one hand I'm caring, empathetic, advocate for rights, have hope and aspirations but also filled with anxiety and guilt over things that aren't my fault so bad that it genuinely affects my daily life. 

and then I have these weird cycles when I get overly stressed or anxious I'll feel my mood drop and I'll be depressed for a few hours which will slowly turn into complete anger and that's when I just switch I become bitter, distrusting, impulsive and hateful of everything. After the anger cools down a little I feel completely apathetic, I don't care about anything or anyone. 

It's completely exhausting, when I'm in this angry 'mode' genuinely do not care who I'm offending, I'll be passive aggressive and at the time it doesn't bother me that I'm like that but then when I snap back I feel guilty which inevitably repeats the overwhelming stress and repeats my stupid cycle. I hate myself but I also don't. 

&amp;#x200B;

I plan on going back to the professional , I'm waiting on an appointment, I want to change (except when I'm feeling the weird way I get in a way where I genuinely think that my opinions and perspectives are more realistic than anyone elses) because I don't like how I am or my actions or anything, I want to be better for the people around me but I wanted to reach out to see if anyone out there experiences this too because I feel completely alone in this.",01Jan2019,1
126,"Hello,

I have recently created a Discord support group focused on helping people who suffer from postorgasmic illness syndrome (POIS). The symptoms of it can be both physical and mental (sore throat and fatigue for example; symptoms often resemble those of flu) and can cause a great suffering each day. As this is not a well known syndrome, a lot of people don't even know this is causing their problems or even if they know, they are naturally afraid to discuss it with others. This group's goal would be to solve this, giving a friendly, warm environment where people can talk about their problems with POIS and find solutions to them.

You can join our server on the following link: https://discord.gg/ZcK3wAA 

I wish you a lovely day (or night):

128,"My mother has always been slightly off the rails, antivax, Jehovah's witness, almost got dragged into an MLM, but now she's under the impression that there's going to be a religious world war 3, with robots who will transform non Christians into cyborgs, and that humans are going to be taken over by implants. And due to her intense fear, she lives to discuss this with her other friends, who participate in a circlejerk and tell her that she's behind on the times, and that this will be a reality very soon, intensifying her fears. She constantly tries to get my brother and I to also believe in the whole robot-cyborg thing. She also believes WiFi is evil, and that we should be living in the 19th century and that we should not have access to technology  because apparently it's all evil. My household WiFi usage is very limited due to her fear. 

I just turned 18, am about to start uni, and I don't get a lot of shifts from my part time job so moving out isnt an option. What kind of support should I be looking for for her? She's insane and delusional, a control freak, gullible, and believes in every piece of bullshit anyone tries to feed her. ",01Jan2019,1
129,"Okay so, I used to be really depressed in 2016 and it lasted about a year, in 2017 I got better and was actually happy and enjoying life.
But on 2018 I started to get depressed again and at the end of said year I was diagnosed with clinical depression and panic disorder.

My boyfriend and I have been together since 2016 but my parents didn’t approve and prohibited my relationship with him because they thought that my depression stemmed from him since he was depressed too, my parents believed that he was affecting me and it was all his doing. But of course, him and I kept in touch and saw each other pretty often but behind my parents’ back.

I got diagnosed with hypothyroidism on 2017, I got treatment and my depression faded away. And now that my depression is back starting 2019 and already got checked out on my thyroid (everything’s completely fine) I don’t know why I’m feeling low again. 

I got diagnosed with depression and panic disorder a few weeks ago by my therapist, but I haven’t told my parents.

I was thinking on telling them about my boyfriend and that we’re talking again but now I can’t because they’ll think that my depression is caused by him and will hate him even more.

They believe that all my odd phases as a young teen were caused by my boyfriend and that they “disappeared” once I supposedly stopped talking to him (but we still talked and still went out) so it can’t be because of him since I never really stopped talking to him, I just lied to my parents.

They believe that I’m their little perfect princess that can’t be ill, that can’t be depressed, they believe that it’s nonsense and I am CHOOSING to be like that.

I don’t know what to do. I feel trapped. I can’t tell them how I feel or they’ll force me to change schools and completely stop talking to my boyfriend (for real this time). I can’t tell them that I got diagnosed with depression because they will not believe me. 



Tl;dr: Got diagnosed with depression but can’t tell my parents because they will not believe me and blame it on myself and the people around me. And therefore I cannot get proper help.

131,"(Excuse me for my bad english)
A while ago i told my mother i have bulimia since 7th grade, and i had suicidal thoughts since then (im 17 now) . I felt great because i finally told her. I always wanted to tell her everything because i want to go to a psychologist. I want to get help. But when i told her she just said ""this is bad, and dont do that."" And she thinks that there is no need for psychologist because ""we just have to change our mindsets"". But i can't do that, it always came back. I'm scared i will fail my GCSE because this is holding me back.
What can i do?",01Jan2019,1

133,"The worst thing about my depression is that I'm slowly losing all motivation to do anything. Even things like reading, watching a funny TV show, relaxing in a nice bath etc. are no longer fun to me. My therapist told me I should ""just get out there and do things"" and eventually things will start to be enjoyable again but so far I've had no luck. 

And when it comes to unpleasant tasks, like cleaning or work, I experience actual physical pain. I explained this to my therapist and he just didn't seem to get it. ""You're capable of moving so you have no excuse"" is pretty much what I was told. ",01Jan2019,1
