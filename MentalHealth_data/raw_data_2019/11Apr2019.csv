0,"Just as the title states. I had a recent even in my life, a tragic one - that has heightened my anxiety. I'll freak out and be on the brink of tears, asking myself ""How can I ever live with this much fear or anxiety?"".",11Apr2019,59
1,"Hey, was planning on using a throwaway, but might as well use my main.

I truly believe my poor upraising screwed me over and resulted in social anxiety and depression. There are some upsides to my development (being enrolled into swimming lessons, being encouraged to play an instrument etc.), but they are the exception, not the norm.

As a kid, my mother was (although not medically diagnosed, I strongly believe) manic-depressive and was highly critical towards me. She would constantly berate me for the tiniest of mistakes, from my posture to the way I stood and and the way I ate my meals. She would even go so far as to suggest I was born healthy, but later had either X or Y problem. I never received any praise or positive reinforcement as a child. From internalizing this criticism, I always had the default mentality that I was a loser going into any new situation.

My father was not very involved in my development and there were days I didn't see him at all since he was away at work. When I confronted him about his lack of involvement in my life as a young teenager, his excuse was just that his parents didn't take an active role in his life (he left home at the age of 14) and so his philosophy on raising a child was for the child to take care of him or herself. I never really had a father figure growing up. My father had an advanced degree in mechanical engineering, but never exposed me to any of his knowledge, skills or experience.

There were various other factors also. As a kid, my parents were fine with me wearing the same clothing day after day, for up to sometimes a week at a time and taught me to act and dress like a snob. They taught me to never ask for help or to buy new things, especially since we were once poor upon immigrating to Canada; I was afraid to ask for a phone until after the end of high school. I always had beaten down clothing and never had a fashion sense at all.

On top of all that, my parents were often fighting and arguing when I was growing up caused a lot of household drama and internal turmoil. I even once told them a divorce would have been beneficial for the entire family (although I retract that statement now).

Early on, I remember not inviting my parents to my elementary school graduation and telling them as a kid that I would never talk to them again after leaving the house. While that is not exactly true, my relationship with my parents was (and still is) very weak and I truly do believe my parents screwed me over, especially socially. I noticed the gap between myself and my cousins when I went to visit them and it was outright atrocious how underdeveloped I was - my cousins toured the world, had many friends and incredible life experiences, despite being roughly the same age as me.

I had social anxiety for most of high school and despite telling my parents about my struggles, they told me to just ""not worry about it"". Despite now being in 3rd year university, this still affects me and I just want to vent out my frustrations. I'm starting to have more suicidal ideations lately, which motivated this post.",11Apr2019,3
2,"I had a friend, they were my best friend. We did everything together and talked about our deepest shit. We lived together for a year and we were so close. They had nowhere to go and I gave them a place to stay. They took advantage of my kindness any way they could. Everything was just a lie, our entire friendship was fake. But why do I miss it so much? All they ever did was lie to me and talk about me behind my back. They used me. They stole from me. When I finally called them out on what they were doing they played the victim, I was the bad guy. I called them out and they blocked me on everything and ran away. But why do I feel the way I do? Why do I miss them so much? I feel so weird and I don't know what to do about it.

I used to be in alot pain because their were to many vocies all at once they would torment me but I have even worked out a deal with the Leader in exchange for keeping the other vocies at bay he wants me to kill people. The leader is called Alpha he really wants me to do it. We have planned out what type of person we should target, how to kill them how to torture them what to watch out for. When I meet people I can't look at their face if I do all I see is Alpha standing behind them smiling then I see flashes of me ripping their eyes and throat out sometimes slicing their neck open or completely decapitating them then I feel this really strong urge to do just that. Everyday we learn a new way on how to kill/torture. I've been training my body to accept drowning slowly so I go under water then come out covering my mouth with a wet wash cloth but now I can only picture myself doing that to someone else I can almost drown them then put the wet wash cloth over their face it will force them to take fast short breaths otherwise they will inhale more water. I have lost control only twice in the past I tried to stab my sister and I suffocated a classmate till he passed out both times I couldn't fight Alpha anymore and snapped everything faded I only heard Alpha's vocie telling me do it and zoned in on my target. Both people are fine we just don't talk about what happened. Alpha was not happy that I failed him twice now the urge is stronger than both times I stay at home and avoid people. I don't take my meds because despite what Alpha wants from me him and the rest of them are the only ones that I trust everyone else lies to me and betrays me. I have demons in my basement and in my attic they watch me, they follow me when I go downstairs I can hear the creaks in the floor and hear their laughing, Alpha does not have control over them but he keeps them trapped in my basement and Attic so as long as I stay away from there they can't hurt me but I can still hear their laughing , hear them call my name taunting me to come downstairs. I tried my biggest coping skill which is music but it just makes the urges stronger I tried going for a hike and it did help until a lady fell off of a cliff in front of me she's fine but it got them really excited. Though killing isn't my idea he somehow makes me crave it.

4,"Whenever I have a breakdown like this, I engage in some sort of self destructive behavior (Idk what else to call it) Because of this, I deleted everything on my Instagram. I don't know why. I just did. I think it may have something to do with the fact that socialmedia makes me hella anxious and lonely sometimes. My friends noticed this and started texting me about it. I didn't text back immediately because I just really needed to be alone with my thoughts so I didn't lash out and make things worse. Now that I've calmed down a little I think I want to text them back and let them know that I'm ok. But I want to do it in a very calm manner. I also really don't want to talk about what set me off because I think it would worry them more (and it's way too much to get into, and I also don't feel like sharing at the moment).

5,"Heya. Name's Alex, 19yo. New to this forum. Guess i'm committing another suicide attempt. Like 4th this year.
I'm so tired of just existing. It's been a year since i stopped using drugs cuz i felt like i was about to try out heroine and that's kinda point of no return. I don't remember being happy at any point of my life. I can't do anything cool, despite some of my friends say i can sing/make photos/play guitar etc. Like i have many hobbies but lately it was a cycle of ""take the guitar-warm up a bit-start singing-cringe out and start hating yourself even more-put it away"". 
I got a few jobs but never really succeeded in any. The only one i at least had some fun was dealing drugs, but once again, i don't wanna return to this.
I never had a gf, despite not being a complete jerk. Like each and every girl i'm trying to speak to either already has a bf, or just doesn't feel like she wants to. It feels like life is just moking at you and i'm doomed to fail each and every thing i start. 
I had a major depression with borderline personality disorder. Went to therapist once bc of a drunk promise to one of my friends. She just told me one day ""get ur ass up, u have a therapy session in like an hour"". And i started my AD and tranquilizers course. And never returned to it. For some time all of the suicidal thoughts and bad emotions were gone but i felt like i'm just a hollow husk.
I always want home, despite I'm already home.
I'm tired to try something new bc anyway i'll fail.
A bit messy. But now y'all know me.

6,"Note: If you have experienced sexual abuse as a child then you might want to look away as this could be triggering to you. 

I was only five years old when my 12 year old cousin came to live with us for a year round about the time her mum had committed suicide. Throughout that whole year she constantly sexually abused me. I won't get into too much detail, but the things she did to me and made me do were unimaginable and something a kid should never have to experience such as oral, forcing me to kiss my other 5 year old friends in front of her and showing me homosexual pornography whenever she got the chance. That's just a small amount of what she did.

After a year or so the sexual abuse had stopped due to her moving out, and because she had led me to believe that what we were doing was OKAY because she ""did it with all of her other friends"", I had continued my life not really thinking anything of what she did to me. I'm now 17 and because she is a close family member I am forced to see her and her baby every week. If I were to ever tell anybody it would completely destroy the family and I don't see the point as she has a partner of her own now and a baby. 

It wasn't until I reached the age of 12 when I began to have flashbacks of what happened to me, and became disgusted at the thought of somebody my age even thinking about a 5 year old sexually. Even still, I downplayed what happened to me and never really considered myself a victim of sexual abuse because I was manipulated into thinking that what we were doing was normal and It wasn't as bad as people who had been sexually abused by adults. 

I've always been in denial about what happened to me, but I can see everything so clearly now. Although my abuser had experienced trauma of her own (her mum committing suicide), she wasnt stupid and seemed to know all of the right things to say in order to manipulate into doing what she wanted. She was also much larger and stronger than your average 12 year old and she had began puberty, etc. 

Despite denying that I had experienced a massive  trauma throughout my childhood to myself, it's no wonder that I am suspected to have Borderline personality disorder, have dealt with severe body dysmorphia and was anorexia from the age of 12 up until now and on top of all that I've had multiple suicide attempts.

I am sick of having to see her all of the time, but anytime I disappear while she comes to visit,  my mum will make a point of yelling at me once she leaves for being disrespectful. My abuser is constantly asking how I'm doing, etc but she knows fine well what she put me through when we were younger. I don't know how she had the fucking audacity to stay in my life and remain close with my mum and sister. She wasn't exactly immature for her age and the amount of graphic things she forced and manipulated me into doing leads me to believe that she wasn't just a clueless child, she knew exactly what she was doing... but at the same time I feel bad for her and don't want her to lose her family because she's already lost her mum.

I guess my questions are is this just as valid as any other sexual abuse case or am I overreacting? 

And should I continue seeing her, if not how do I get out of it considering all of my family are very close to her and she lives ten minutes away from me.",11Apr2019,7

8,"Dear people of reddit,

So today me and my dad got into another fight. It started when I questioned something he was talking about in the car ride home from school. It dealt with him talking about his apartment from an old job and him saying how clean it was. (All of his talking related to how I should be organized with my life). Then I asked something about,  ""why did you have so many boxes everywhere then?"" Or something around those words. I never said it in any tone or meant it in a bad way but he didn't take it like that and got angry.  Soon after we got in the house he started screaming at me that we have no dog food then proceded to let
my dogs outside the front yard. I went out to get them and when I got to the front door he locked me out. I waited for half an hour but he never opened it even though I kept knocking. I soon called my grandparents to pick me up and it leaves me here in the car writing this. I get that he could have taken that the wrong way but I don't feel it is right to do all the things mentioned. So my questions are is this normal? This is not the first time and he gets mad like this for no reason a lot.  Another is should some authority get involved? Like the police or some mental help. Lastly is who should I ask for help? I know reddit isn't the best way but I'm trying this as a way to seek info. If anyone reads this please messege me.

I put too much on my best friend and she couldn't handle it. She told other people about what I was going through so that way she wasn't the only one helping me. At the beginning I was semi okay with it, but she kept telling more and more people and that really hurt me because I felt betrayed. I can barely trust people and she knows that. It was also really stressful because I don't like others knowing since it gives me a lot of anxiety. I got mad at her but I realized that it was all my fault. I tried to talk to her but it didn't work and I think I made everything worse. 

I was so angry but I didn't want to direct it at her because I still love her, she was my best friend. So I isolated myself and I blocked her and started hurting myself every way I could think of. I told my therapist I was wasn't going back to therapy and all I've been doing is crying, and trying to not contact anyone.

I started dating someone a while ago and he's absolutely wonderful. Genuinely one of the best things that ever happened to me. I think the most frustrating part about my depression is that I was niave and convinced myself that having someone who really loved me would fix all of this. I thought the anxiety and the depression would fade with his presence. When he's around I feel almost normal again, but when he's not the crash is surprisingly difficult to deal with.

19,"Growing up I was always a very anxious kid, and knew I was different. I wasn’t very social, my mother was a narcissist and periods of depression/severe anxiety were a common occurrence for me. 
Around two weeks ago I began to realize something wasn’t right. I was becoming very depressed, and extremely on edge. Depression and anxiety turned into voices, and extreme mood swings at the drop of a hat. 
The movies describe periods of psychosis pretty accurately. For a solid 3 or 4 days I was out of touch with my reality. Absolutely horrifying paranoid thought loops raced around in my mind faster than I had ever experienced.
I began locking my door, closing my blinds and hiding my valuables in the most hard to reach nooks and crannies of my dorm room. 
Yes, I was smoking pot heavily when this happened. However, in my defense, I had been smoking at about the same pace for a year prior with no real issue. 
The only warning signs I experienced was cataplexy-like symptoms on and off for about one month prior to the breakdown. My sleeping schedule was also terrible at the time.
Two days later I’m fine with the help of medication and therapy. This experience has taught me to not think of mental illness lightly. I lost three days, and the months leading up to the breakdown were filled with constant anxiety.
The result of the breakdown was a complete ego death, and a much happier me.

I’m gonna try and keep this short. Basically, I remember a lot of things no one else does. And not just a few events. Literally every time I say “oh, remember when X happened?” I get a strange look and a confused conversation ensues. And I don’t think I’m making them up either. I had one friend come out to me twice because they forgot, and another friend came out to me THREE TIMES and were super freaked out when I said they already told me the second and third times. I have so many vivid long term memories that no one else in my life remembers, even though I have proof they happened. 

And the weird part? My short term memory SUCKS. I go to my therapist and she asks me how I’ve been and I say great because the last two days were fine and they make up pretty much my whole perception of the universe. But three days earlier I was in a major depressive episode for a few days, and I already forgot? Maybe this is just normal, but I have my suspicions. Maybe my perception of a ‘normal memory’ is actually false advertising of the real deal. Maybe everyone I know has awful long term memory. Maybe I’m just living in an alternate timeline. Who knows.

26,"I don't know where else to go...I just need help....

There's been so much going on in my life for the last two weeks. On the 2nd I gave birth to my still born baby...on the 5th my insurance cut me off (just found out today)... yesterday I went with my husband to pick up our baby's remains (we cremated her...) And today I've been trying to get things done that can't wait any longer. My car needed a new ball bearing on the passengers side. It's going to be a lot...my husband was out of work for a week because of our daughter's passing...so we're struggling now with money... and what takes the cake is I found out our insurance kicked me off of our plan, because my husband's reserves unit messed up....

We're not covered...I had several doctor's appointments (including an important postpartum appointment) scheduled that I have to cancel until things get figured out. My husband's reserves unit was being deployed in August, but since my husband is non-deployable (because of medical reasons) he continually told them he wasn't going. They apparently put orders in for his deployment in March, didn't tell him, then just deleted his orders all together. So now we're not insured until DEERS fixes this mistake and they're only going to back date us, not extend our coverage to cover the days we don't have it. 

Plus, today I took my car to the shop because it needed an alignment, and to check out a sound that it was making. The ball bearing on the passengers side was just free and it's going to cost about $450. I asked him if I should go ahead with it and he told me to. Now he's upset because we really don't have the money right now. 

Wait, it gets better. We've been waiting for almost four months for the reserves to pay us my husband's bonus. He was active until this year and signed with the reserves for a bonus. We were supposed to get it in January. Then they told us February. Now they're saying mid April...

On top of all this we were moving from a small house to a bigger one when I had to be induced because our baby had passed. Housing is now needing us to get the other house clean by Friday so they can get everything ready for a new tenant. 

I just want to lay down and go to sleep...I don't want to have a day where I have to go do something. I haven't been able to relax, or even grieve. 

I miss my baby so much, but I can't even just take a moment to miss her. I'm doing all this other crap because life goes on. My brain literally can't take anymore and I feel like I'm going to die of an aneurysm from all this stress.

31,"Hello all that can give me some guidance,

I have been looking after a friend that I have witnessed from his diagnoses with manic schizophrenia over the last 3 years become increasingly worse. His mother is at this point, I believe, where she is unable to bare and deal with what he is going through. It has gotten to the point where she relies on me to tell her what to do and I have taken on the task to keep him in check. She feels as if she should be able to live her life and is being burdened by him. He is 25 and cannot be forced to do anything. I have had to deescalate many of his lapses and episodes with no help from his family. He has been in and out of the psych ward numerous times and even to rehabilitation centers in other states. There seems to be no progress made and no intention from himself to better his mental health.

From his standpoint, he does not want to take his meds because it has caused him to gain weight in the past and lose libido. He has a horrible drinking problem and he believes it helps him sleep and dampens voices in his head, but often sends him into a manic state. It has gotten to the point where he really needs help but he won't listen to anyone and believes he can cure himself; now with alcohol and even talking about his need for opiates. He has never been exposed to opiates before, recreationally or prescribed. He was on his medication all last summer and he was doing really good. It seems the more he is involved and social the less he has a relapse. More than ever now he drinks until he becomes unconscious and often gets kicked out of bars drinking alone while he goes on about what is going on in his mind.  

I am curious as to what I can do to help before he harms himself or others. He has already been violent with me, but I know if I distance myself from the situation he will no longer have any support (even if he does not want it). It's hard to see a childhood friend spiral like this and i want whats best for him. 

There are so many levels to this that I have not relayed in this post but any suggestions are welcome.

His mom has been able to bring him into the hospital and get him a bed but when she is out of town like she always is, is there a way i can find him help?

Thank you for taking the time to read this, please, if anything i would like to know legalities in admitting a friend or a way to encourage him to take his medication.

33,"I remember back when I was eleven I saw a gif on tumblr from of a movie of a guy thinking about killing himself in a bathroom stall. I don’t know what it was about that gif but something just clicked in my head and although the post talked about how accurate and sad the scene was, and spoke about how serious mental illness is and to seek help, I did the opposite. For whatever reason, maybe because I was a child, I found myself becoming more interested in mental illnesses like depression, anxiety, and ocd. I’m pretty sure I had all of those things prior but I was able to ignore them. It wasn’t until I came across that post that I started to analyse my own thought processes and mental health. I became aware of unhealthy coping mechanisms and indulged in them instead of seeking proper treatment because I romanticised the unhealthy behaviour. If I had avoided that maybe I would still be mentally ill but at least I would have been more functional. But who can say really? Maybe I would have ended up the same way, it would have just take longer to happen. Maybe I was meant to be like this, maybe I wasn’t. Has anyone else experienced something similar?",11Apr2019,2

40,"I’m a 24 years old male from the UK working as a designer for an app startup. I’ve been here nearly a year and a half and love my work. Fantastic opportunities with a great team, and the bonus of a modern day company culture allowing me to WFH, take courses, or have unlimited holiday providing my work gets done!

Last year I suffered a huge mental breakdown, this was caused by nearly 10 years of problems which I always tried to keep quiet; depression, anxiety, bulimia, low self esteem and suicidal thoughts.

After deciding to get therapy I told my work who were really accommodating allowing me to take time off for sessions etc. However after I stopped seeing my therapist at the end of 2018 due to her being unwell and financial issues I’ve started to slip back into old habits.

Due to my eating disorder I regularly binge and purge making myself unwell, this then makes me hate the way I look, which gives me huge anxiety and depression about going out of the house facing people. It’s a viscous circle! 

Im able to WFH once a week, and they’re very flexible ensuring you can be at home as long as you get the work done. Since January however I’ve found nearly every week I’ve had to take a sick day 9/10 due to mental health reasons. I’m very reactive at work meaning I work long hours and try to get things done ASAP no matter the time of day, I’m the sole designer and my list is never ending. I’m stressed all the time which is a huge reason why I binge.

Whilst my manager was supportive last year, I don’t get the same sense now as we lead up to a huge deadline. I don’t want to leave my job or take time off as it would only make me worse, but equally there’s some days where I can’t face going in! How can I carry on like this? My mood is so up and down I sometimes think it’s the end of the world... I’d like to be open, but I come from a very closed and unsupportive family. I’m seeking therapy treatment again, but in the long run how can I stay in a positive mood to work and ensure no one thinks I’m taking time off for the sake of it?",11Apr2019,8

There must be a lot of study on this issue. I'm sure many people grapple with it. Can anybody point me toward resources or books where I can learn more on this? It must have a scientific name or something. I can't search for information on it because I don't know what it's called.",11Apr2019,1

I don’t find joy in anything I do I am just going through the motions of life against my will because for some reason ‘suicide is bad.’ I hate myself and the state of the world.

Humans are destroying the world and there are more humans doing harm to the world and other humans than there are humans that are decent. Why is it bad if I want to die? I’m going to anyway eventually, the world is overpopulated anyway, and it’s me and my body why can’t I do what I want?

https://twitter.com/patthemanager/status/1074334325871505408?s=19

So I thought I'd make my own list for someone that has broken their leg and wants to take pain relief for it:
Before taking pain relief:
Try walking it off
Try drinking some milk 
Try not sitting down for too long
Talk about how much your leg hurts
Know that people love you and want your leg to heal
Get some fresh air 
Give thanks
...sound ridiculous right, the thing is although the intention was good of this post and I do appreciate that these things will help mental illnesses, it is sometimes as hard to get out of bed as it is to stand up on a broken leg.There is such a stigma around taking prescribed medication to treat mental health issues that even I didn't want to get them to help but honestly they have helped so much. It's okay to ask for help, taking medicine to treat a mental health issue is in way no different to taking pain relief for a broken leg. It does not make you weak and you are not giving up, getting help is one of the hardest things to do! Never blame yourself for having a disbalance of chemicals/ signals in your brain or having a bad day. Look after yourself, go and get medicine prescribed, go get therapy, do something that makes you happy even if you don't think its productive, it is as it is looking after yourself. Look after yourself people ❤",11Apr2019,173
46,"Hey. This is a repost of my first post (I'm sorry for being annoying) on reddit. I've heard of the website before from friends and family but never really got around to it. Im sorry if I'm posting this in the wrong place I'm not exactly sure but I really need someone to help me out here.

Throughout my whole life I used to get this feeling that would travel up the back of my head towards the top, I would feel full and alive in my head, in turn I would feel grounded and actually here. However for the past few months I haven't felt that feeling at all and whenever I attempt to, it feels very strained and never reaches the top of my head, instead it feels blocked and pushed back down my neck. This has  impacted me in so many ways where I feel as If I cannot focus, I cant absorb what I read or even stay focused when reading (my eyes are constantly scanning the page and not focusing on the words) I feel as if I'm here but not exactly here?? Like I'm not experiencing what I should be?? I'm getting very stressed out over it and have difficulty feeling emotion if any. Does anyone know what this could be? How do I undo the blockage in my neck and restore that feeling that I used to feel? I'm hoping if I do feel it then I'll feel alive or full in my head again. If it helps I did a CT scan and nothing was wrong with my head although my neck was shown to be very tense, I asked around my family  as well and they felt my neck with comments saying it's really tight.
I don't know I feel like I'm going insane and no one is believing me anymore about this feeling I used to get. 
Once again I'm sorry if I posted this in the wrong place and hope someone helps me here as I'm extremely desperate and this is getting me depressed and I hope I'm not going insane.

Around 3 months ago, I had a psychotic episode in which I thought that my parents were sociopaths that were statutorily raping me.

It all seems so absurd to me now, but back then I truly believed that because of the way my parents ""looked"" at me.

That day, the police were called, and I got sent to a psychiatric hospital where I still held on to my delusions. I got diagnosed with psychosis, and it took me around a month to get back to normal.

My parents were severely investigated because of my accusations.

Now my parents hate me for the hell I put them through, and I honestly don't blame them. They're really good people that did nothing wrong. I'm probably the worst daughter in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

We are currently looking for people to take part in our research study exploring potential protective factors against suicide. You do not have to experience thoughts to take part, as we are interested in the protective factors too.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone over 16 years of age and fluent in English can take part. If you decide to participate we will ask you to complete an online questionnaire now, and then (if you’re willing to do so) again every month for the next two months. The questionnaire should only take around 20-25 minutes to complete, but you can take as long as you need. 

Some of the questions will ask about current mood, any suicidal thoughts or self-harm. If there is a chance that this could be upsetting, there is no obligation to take part and there is always the option to stop the questionnaire at any time. Any answers you give within the questionnaire are completely confidential and anonymous. If you would like to take part, please click the link below. This will take you to the survey and study information page.

52,"Okay, so I recently was release from the hospital for major depression. I have been someone who played video games since I was 4 years old. As I was released from the hospital and prescribed with meds I have been feeling amazingly great! But today for the first time since I was released from the hospital I decided to play some games and catch up with old friends. As soon as I jumped on the console I felt a deep, deep sadness something I haven’t felt in weeks. I was getting stuck in my own thoughts and was again back in my old way of self hate and anxiety.  Now that I am off the game I was playing I feel more relaxed and happy. I have calmed down and feel like the way I use too. Is there a reason for this? It’s just weird before I was on my MEDS I could play the games as they were the only thing that gave me happiness. Now it’s the exact opposite they’re the things making me sad and depressed.

I kind of broke for the first time when they said ""Just write other people"" like...I thought you understand my social anxiety. You were the one that said it's ok that not everyone is capable for the same things and that my anxiety is a valid feeling.  
Last week we saw again after two month of mostly nothing. It ended in an hour long monolog about what he is doing, where he is going, his new boyfriend. Not a question about me, how I feel. When I finally could push somethin of me in between, it was that I finally told my parents that I'm not feeling good and how they support me and call me a lot and that we are watching movies together via phone call, his only reaction was a ""That's pretty sad.""   
Yeah I should lower my expectation on people, they will never react like I want them to, but that was hard. And it make me falling in a deep hole of depression for the last two weeks.

64,"Basically the grounding techiques I use are ones I have tweaked or completely developed on my own. I'm going walk you through I decent amount of my top favorites for gaining control over myself again; whether it be from suicidal indentation, crippling anxiety, trying to tame elxplosive anger, really low self image/esteem and many more; these have helped me personally in all situations mentioned.


***5-4-3-2-1***  This is a sensory grounding exercise. (It is my personal go-to.) There may be a different technical order somewhere. I personally can never remember it so I complete the exercise by: First I started by naming, outloud, 5 things I can see. The key is not merely find things but focus on them, notice the details you can see. That had hastily glance you'd have missed. I suggest as you name the item in sight you expand and mention unique qualities about the sight. Secondly, I will name 4 things I can touch. You can move your hands to touch things for this. Notice how it feels. Is it rough or soft? Dense or heavy? When listing your items touched out loud try mentioning how they felt. Third, name the things you can hear. Yet again, try and list how they sounded. Was is loud and sharp in tone? Or barely auditible. Fourth, list 2 things you can smell. Remember to mention how the smelled. If your like me and have trouble describing how things taste and smell, then describe how the sensations made you feel. For example you smell an apple pie, it reminds you of Thanksgiving. Which in turn makes you feel thankful, or surrounded by love. Fifth and final, you're are almost done. List a taste your tasting, and let's not be vague about it. Describe in detail how it tastes. You have now completed 5-4-3-2-1. Assess how you are feeling in comparison to before you start this exercise. It's fine to repeat this exercise a couple of times. I personally will do it 2-3 times if needed. If the third its still not helping because I'm just that worked up I move to a different coping skill. [This exercise generally helps the most with me for suicidal identation, self harm, grounding myself if I'm in a depersonalization/derealization episode and anxiety. Through you can try it for anything. This merely where I see the most benefit. Results will change person to person.]


***Progressive Muscle Relaxation***  This technique is a great way to center yourself, its always very calming. It's the second thing I go to in my ""Conquering my Mental Health Issues Toolbelt"". For this exercise you may do it standing, laying down, or sitting. I personally find the most benefit from sitting in a chair, feet positioned spread apart at about shoulder width firmly place on the ground. I square my back into that impossible-to-hold-for-long-periods-if-you-slouch-too-much perfect posture position. Keep your breath steady and even while doing this. Focus on your toes, do you feel them? Good. Now tighten then as hard as you squeezing them and trying you best to tense every muscle in your toes as hard as you can. Hold for 10-30 secs. Now release.  How does it feel? See your toes were like you tense and holding on to stuff to long until it caused you discomfort. But when you released, ""let go"", your toes were no longer under pressure.  In fact, they should feel even better then before. Because before they tensed, they felt normal. While being tensed they were under a great deal of pressure. When released not only did they let go of the pressure, but due to the tensing they are now stronger. As you continue with this exercise, I ask you keep this analogy in mind. And going forward each time you tense a section, think about something pressuring you, stressing you out. Maybe it's difficulties with family, or maybe those dark thoughts (I refer to my dark thoughts as ""The dark and twisties"". Yes, I know it's a Grey's 
Anatomy reference. I just relate to it a lot). Continuing on. Now tense your toes again, but this time also tense all those foot muscles. Its okay if you can't tense them all perfectly, it takes practice. Again, hold the tensed muscles for 10-30 secs while thinking of a stressors. And release, and as doing such try to visualize that stress being let go of to. Maybe you let go and it's a balloon and it just slowly floats away. Ok now, tense your toes, feet, and calves. Tense all the muscles as hard as you can. You wanna feel discomfort or maybe a little pain from the tension level. Hold 10-30 secs, remember to keep a stressor in mind while doing this. And release, not only your muscles, but that annoying little stressor as well. Now tense your toes, feet, calves, and thighs. Keeping pesty stressor in mind. Hold 10-30 secs. Release, the muscles that are starting to ache, as well as that burden just holding you down. I'm not going write out all of this as it's repetitive. Just merely continue tensing your muscles while adding the next location wise section to the mix. And remember use the stressors. I personally will think of small things stressing me as I start with just the toes and work my way to the heavier ones as I'm adding more muscle to tense. When you complete this exercise, your muscles should feel at ease. Your stressors should feel a bit more manageable. Remember you are not your stressors, so letting them burden you as such is only consuming and pulling out your negativity. You will get through this. You are strong. And you are brave. [This exercise I use for Anxiety, Getting stuck on my dark and twisties, depression, impulsivity, and the rationalizing fears of abandonment. Yet again, things are the benefits I noticed for myself. They can differ from person to person]. 


***Positives***  This one is my favorite of all. It has helped me defeat eating disorders and a non-existent self esteem. I do this one regardless of if I get to it in my grounding exercise queue or not. I have done this for the better part of 8 years, when I started out I did it everytime I had a self depicating thought. Now I do it 2-4 times a day. This one is probably out of all I mentioned the hardest to adjust to and the most exposing. If you do it right will feel extremely vulnerable starting this exercise. But if you finish it correctly you'll come out feeling better about yourself. The more you do it: the better you'll feel about yourself, the self esteem you'll have, it can help your negative outlook on the world into a positive one. So to start, go find a mirror to stand in front of. Your there? Ok this is going be brutual. Look at yourself closely, study every inch of you body, face, and even your brain. Now I'm going start you out with training wheels, I'll explain the differences in a bit. Now list 5 things you hate about yourself. I mean completely loathe, would change it in a heartbeat if you could. I'll run through the exercise my self to give you a example. *My hates:* my teeth, my stomach, my ache, my nose, and my short term memory being complete crap. Now notice these are all negative thoughts, they are dragging me down. And by looking at myself in such a negative light, guess what I'm setting up my outlook for everything to negative. Because like it or not, how you see yourself highly effects how you see everything. Well now were here, feel like shit because all we see are the flaws. Now is time for the second part. This one is hard to do. For every flaw come up with three positives. Yours may be positives about anything. Me since ive been doing this so long I try my best to make positives about the flaws I mentioned. So let's see I mentioned hating
*My teeth:* I have a dentist appointment set up, the people closest to me love my smile, and this smile is routely there for my friends(see last one I couldnt think of anything so I linked it else where).  *My stomach:* I'm exercising, been losing weight, and the only reason I have a tummy is because it held my beautiful daughter for 9 monthes. 
*My ache:* I'm trying everything I can so I'm giving it my best effort, I reach out to a dermatologist, and with age its getting a tad better.  
*My nose:* I love my polish hertiage; therefore I should take pride in genetic trait, it's not as big as it seems I'm just merely being hard on myself, and it's great at smelling things (ex. It smell a electrical fire in my. Water heater from across the house while I was sleeping. Those alerting to the problem so I could get help prevent my family from harm).  *short-term memory loss:*  my long term memory is spectacular, there's medications that can help, and by letting go of stress I can probably free my memory up a bit. 
Now I know some of the positives I came up with were more so situations, but having a situation can relieve stress and make you more positive. Now training wheels. I asked you to do this for five things, I personally am to a point I do it absolutely everything negative I can find. When I started doing this I weighted roughly 80 lbs. I was highly anarexic. Within 2-3 months of doing it at least once a day. I found I could look in the mirror again, and not only that but start to loving myself again. *If you want a added bonus* before you and your partner go to bed. Stop them , ask them to say three positive about you, then have them say three about them selves. After they are done do the same to them and yourself. [Self-esteem, negativity, and help you make situations. These are my results, they may vary person to person].



***Desensitization***  This is the last one. It's very simple. For myself I go into the bathroom, I lay in the empty tub. Letting the cold porcelain chill me slightly. I make so there is absolutely not a speck of light. I also make sure there is no noise. Then I simply lay there. Unable to see, if I speak my schos hallowed and empty, nothing to hear. I just shut off as much of my sensories as possible. I push everything out of my mind. And lay there for 10-60 minutes just merely existing. And when I emerge I tend to be calmer, less stressed, lighter, and with less chatger in my brain. [This is a exercise I came up with completely on my own. I dont not know how it will affect other people. It and with a manic mind, adhd, and stress].


***In Closing***  I'm 26. Ive been diagnosed with bipolar, PTSD, generalized anxiety disorder (acute), depersonalization/derealization, and BPD. These may not work for you. But I can attest doing this in combination of medication, and therapy has gotten me to the point people dont notice anything wrong with me. They are surprised to silence, when they find out. I have with these exercises manage to build me into a almost normal functional human being. If you try these. Please give me thoughts and feedback.  Just remember. You are brave, you are strong, and you are intelligent. You disorders will not control you so long as you dont let them.",11Apr2019,6

67,"Hi all!

So I have seperation anxiety. 
First I had it pretty bad as a child and was afraid my parents would leave/forget me. Then it sort of went away for a couple of years and then it came back when I started dating and having girlfriends (15 year old). I think it came back because I didn't feel safe at home and with my parents and I only felt safe and loved with my girlfriend.

Now I'm 28 and I have a really bad seperation anxiety with my current girlfriend. I see her as a save haven and when see is gone at night (party, vacation etc) I get panic attacks or high anxiety. Because I don't feel safe on my own. I'm seeing a therapist for some time now to work on the traumatic experiences of my past and she suggested to take Oxazepam or anti depression drugs to break the cycle of anxiety and experience the world doesn't end when I'm home alone.

I'm not a big fan of taking these drugs so I'm on a quest to learn everything there is to know about seperation anxiety and healing trauma. I'm also looking into creative therapy like drama and sports. I will do all this stuff next to my current herapy sessions. 

I have multiple questions:
- can anyone advice me good books, podcasts or other material I can consume?
- can anyone advice me how to deal with seperation anxiety and tell me what helpt them to heal?
- does anyone have good experience with creative therapie?

Any help is appreciated :)",11Apr2019,1

During the next good couple of years I've been to many psychiatrists (who said they can't really diagnose me until I'm an adult and prescribed me meds that had very bad side effects, so we had to stop them), psychologists (who focused more on my family relationships than me and didn't have a specific therapy program so we often sat in silence), and a therapist (who said I'm a lesbian because I don't care if boys like me, I reduce myself to a child by using a diminutive of my name and that I'm manipulating everyone because I sat in the middle of the room... hmmMMM).

74,"Hello, please bear with me! 1) New to reddit so I'm not sure I'm using it right... 2) For context, I'm neurodivergent myself but not of the same variety my friend is. That being said, I apologize in advance if anything I say or am concerned about comes across with ablest undertones or accidentally...just full on ablest? By all means, please inform me if that's the case! It's obviously not my intent.

&amp;#x200B;

Anywho. I have a fairly decent friend who I've known for about...2-3 years now? She's a member of a club i'm in (and i am currently running) and while she's always been more of a (self proclaimed) odd duck, she's super sweet and considerate. As I'm in a position of power, though, and have been under more stress lately I've noticed her stimming behaviors will set me off a bit more than before. At times it seems like she's much more aggressive about it, likely because of stress in her own life, but when trying to run the meetings and stay on track it can be off-putting and makes it very hard for ADHD brain me to keep focused.

&amp;#x200B;

Mind you, I engage in my own stimming behaviors at times and I am fully aware how it works and we've talked about it! I let her use my stimming tools (fidget toys, stress balls, depends on the day) and that helps. But when it doesn't she does very, very 'outlandish' stims such as jumping in place, what seems to be playing around (dramatic poses randomly in the middle of the room, balancing in place which has at one point almost sent someones laptop flying because she lost her balance...) and similar things. Some of these traits and actions are just her and her personality, but I know that some of these are at their core stims. Even so, the more 'outlandish' stims can trigger anxiety for me and I know it's gotten me irritable lately, which I hate because she doesn't really deserve that. I have had to tell her to please go in a specific area of the room that isn't so close to me so the stims don't overwhelm me, or aren't as view-able to me so she can do her thing while I try to focus or run meetings. Honestly, though, this is a downhill situation. I need to figure out a way for us to figure this out that benefits us both.

&amp;#x200B;

I would never want to ask her to stop her Stimming behaviors because it's literally the thing that keeps her focused/awake at times. Yet I know if something isn't done for us, I will continue to get irritable and anxious and it puts a strain in my relationship with her in regards to platonic affections between us and my overall patience at times....  


If anyone has advice/words of wisdom, I'd be very appreciative. I've always kind of struggled with this dichotomy.  I know my stims kind of have a similar influence to my mother, in the sense it bothers/overwhelms her at times. Yet I can't help it or it helps me! So how can both parties compromise?

I still make impulsive mistakes, find it hard to communicate verbally at work, and feel like a dumbass with a regressing IQ.

76,"TL;DR: I'm experiencing symptoms of trauma, which has triggered my old depression, and it's been an endless spiral of questioning self worth, blame, and deservedness.

Long version: I work in a trauma informed field and have battled clinical depression my entire life, with multiple suicide attempts and a Baker Act so I'm acutely aware of the symptoms I'm experiencing right now. But what I didn't realize was the trauma I experienced during a four-year toxic relationship which ended in an excruciatingly traumatic physical event. A friend sent me an article about c-ptsd and I realized that I was experiencing almost everything it talked about, the flashbacks everyday, the spontaneous crying, the triggers everywhere I look, the inability to function, the paralyzing anxiety, spontaneous panic attacks from any small reminder. 

I'm spiraling and grasping at anything I can to keep going but I haven't found it yet. I haven't been able to go to work for two days, or leave the house. I just didn't realize how much of an impact the abuse had on me. I always rationalized it by saying he didn't mean what he said, he was just upset. Even after he spit on me, nearly pushed me off a balcony, and left me without a car two hours away from my home, I still stayed. I was desperate for some type of normalcy, I didn't want to live as a ""victim"", I wanted to erase what had happened...so I took him out to dinner and I became the loving girlfriend again. After all, I felt I deserved it and he was drunk at the time, so it was justified. 

Feeling deserving of abuse is something I still struggle with and can't honestly say I haven't overcome. I'm not perfect, I picked fights, I asked questions about things he didn't want to talk about, I threw his phone on the fateful night he deserted me in another city. I asked about the secret conversations he had with his ex wife, I found the messages, I wasn't perfect. But does that deserve the endless derogatory comments whenever he was mad? The name calling? The incessant yelling over seemingly anything? Calling me trash and worthless because he felt slighted in some way? I don't know, maybe.

So it's been a month and he's already posting pictures of his very beautiful rebound and I'm angry that he gets to be happy, that he is probably thinking how much better this person is than me, when I can't get his screaming out of my head. How does he ever get to love again after he broke me? I suddenly feel even more worthless, like of course I don't deserve happiness because I'm the one who can't get out of bed, I'm the one with no friends and no hobbies, I'm the one who struggles to find meaning in life, I'm the one who always asks too many questions, I'm the one who caused his anger, it's all me and I have nothing to offer someone else. The reflexive response is to say I do but I truly don't believe that, some people just aren't worth very much, that there is no grand meaning and purpose for every person on this planet.

There's more to this story but the point is that I don't know if it's C-PTSD but I think it's part of it. With depression, I have to cling to whatever I can as a reason to get up each morning, that's just always been the case. I cling to relationships as that purpose because I haven't found it anywhere else. In group therapy once, the question was asked, what makes you get up every day? One person answered the sunset, another said their family. For me, I've always searched for love and support so the idea that maybe it's out there is the reason I get up and why I hold on so tightly to a person when they hurt me. As bad as my relationships have been, I convince myself every time that maybe tomorrow will be better, there's always hope they'll be better and we'll be better and life will be okay. So when that hope is taken away, I'm left struggling to find a reason to get up again. Yes, he did horrible things that I keep replaying in my mind. And yes, my chest tightens and I feel nauseated when a man looks at me. But if he called me tomorrow to come over, I would, because I need that hope I can't find in anything else.",11Apr2019,1

So I try to go and talk/ vent about my problems to my friends (which is what most people do) but she takes it as us talking shit about her so now she has me blocked on everything and is no longer speaking to me and if she does it’s her telling me how shitty I am and how poorly I treat her or throwing my stuff out of the den we hang out in or her giving me dirty looks.

I’ve been somewhat Ok for the past 9 (Ish) months, now shit’s just falling on top of me and i feel stuck.

This is also kind of an Update from my last post here, But not really.

Meds and diagnosis:
I’ve been taking Zoloft (Sertaline) for a year, and for some reason my perscription got messed up and i haven’t taken my meds in over a week.
I need my meds to be stable and not kill myself (i was seriously close last year)
I’m diagnosed with clinical depression and generalized anxiety (+ social anxiety)
Late winter and spring is the WORST time of year for me because of past trauma so this is PERFECT timing for me to have issues with my perscription and not having meds for two weeks.

Current situation:
I dropped out of school a month ago because the stress ruined my mental health.
Most of my friends were from that school, so after dropping out i rarely see anyone except my roomate and family.
I’m too fatigued (oh yeha i’m constantly exhausted and have been for literal years) to reach out and do shit with other people. I’m also an NPC, because i rarely talk to anyone unless they reach out to me first.
I’m used to be alone and prefer being alone, But not talking to anyone for a week straight gets to me.

‘Best’ friend:
My best friend (and roomate) and i recently stopped talking because she’s pissed at me, i’m not sure Why, she even sent a text explaining But i still dont fully understand.
She talked about me ignoring her, and not answering to a simple Yes or no question, she promptly ended the text by calling me disrespectful. i have my reasons to being a shitty friend, but then again cannot deal with explaining myself, which is Why i haven’t answered her. It’s seriously draining for me to talk to people because i feel like i have to explain myself all the time. 
My friend’s naturally negative and manipulative, i’ve been ignorant enough for 13 years to think she wasn’t manipulating me. But she has, Idk if she’s aware But she had strategically isolating me from anyone else than her. Her main thing is dropping in negative things about a person enough to make me see them the way she wants me to and making them seem like bad people. She has done this with several people (over 10), most of them were potential and previous friends. 
I feel like i’ve avoided approaching certain people because of her. I’ve lost friends because of her. I’ve been depending on her for the last 7 years, and now that We’re not talking i feel lost.
This is an EXTREMELY toxic friendship, But we’ve had so much fun i dont want to lose her.


I have so many feelings (shocker)
I dont want to hang out with anyone because it’s mentaly and physically draining. I don’t answer messages, because i dont feel like explaining.
I’m basically pushing everyone away, and complaing about being lonely. 

I dont know how to deal.
I feel like the first thing i need to deal with is my Goddamn meds, But no matter how many people i call nothing changes. I’ve called my therapist and doctor at the local polyclinic several times with no luck. I’ve tried to contact my gp with no answer.

I have severe depression and anxiety and have had it for the past almost 10 years now. I’ve always had trouble being stuck in my head, troubled by the what-ifs and whatever else. To say the least, it really holds me back socially and it’s incredibly frustrating.

My psychiatrist has mentioned that because there’s so much going on in my head all the time, information is easily forgotten or jumbled up. I feel like that might have a hand in it? It just sucks because I feel like I’m incompetent or stupid bc I have trouble with social situations, even though objectively I know that’s not the case.

I'm not really sure what to do. I live in an area where the weather is very poor tonight and the place I usually go to is closed due to the weather and my psychologist isn't available. I really needed a meeting this week.

For background: I was sexually abused when I was 15-16 and then emotionally abused 16-18 by boyfriends. I possibly have PTSD because I suffer from panic attacks and flashbacks. 

I really needed a session this week because last Thursday I had a flashback that bled into my real life. I physically typed my response to the conversation I was having with my ex-boyfriend (in my head) to my current boyfriend. When I realized what happened I had a panic attack where I couldn't be consoled and had to call my current boyfriend (we don't live together) to come to try to calm me down. Neither of us got a lot of sleep and he had a quiz the next morning. I feel like I bother him. He tells me to call him when I'm having troubles, but I don't want to annoy him because I'm sad a lot. 

I've been getting hallucinations too. I don't think it's schizophrenia because it only happens after 7 pm and most often when the lights are off (though not always).

So my parents decided enough is enough. My mom dragged my 25 year old ass to a psychiatrist last week. And he diagnosed me for depression and anxiety. I'm on meds for that and also additional sleep medication. 

I can't believe how inept and callous I am and how far I've fucked my life up already. Being medicated for depression is a real wake up call for me because I never realised I had it honestly. 

Oh and I've alienated all my school and university friends. Good friends too. I've like nobody to talk to right now. And I just wanted to get this off my chest.

95,"Hey all, so a bit of background on me: I am 23 years old, Asian American. I live with my parents and work a full time job out of college. I have a girlfriend and two younger siblings, and I make decent enough money while I'm learning JavaScript on the side in order to one day become a developer. I've had pretty bad anxiety in the past since I was 16. I'm pretty sure it stems from my childhood, but I've just been dealing with and adapting to it on my own for the last 7 or so years. I try to do everything right: eat healthy, work out, not isolating myself. I keep a bullet journal and meditate too which helps. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I've taken a big step in seeking help. I found a psychologist (I'm paying cash, about 160 per session but I can afford it in my budget so it's not too big of a deal to me although I do feel uncomfortable swiping my card for it at times). I had my first session with her yesterday and it felt rather short to me. But she asked me questions on how I felt, my symptoms that I filled out on a questionnaire, and what led to me seeking treatment. She told me she doesn't usually do this on the first session but she recommended I try to go to my general practitioner and seek out an SSRI. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm hesitant because I'm scared of the side effects. I know it's different for everyone and the only way I'll really know if it'll work is by trying it. But I have a few doubts:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Do I really need it? I have trouble controlling my anger whenever I feel overwhelmed by everything seemingly happening at once, but I can function and hold down a job. I did have a bit of a rough time finishing up my Bachelor's but I finished in 4. It was pretty rough towards the end of the last year though.
2. I find it really strange that my psychologist recommended it after only one session. But it doesn't seem like she's misleading me and I can't think of any way where me taking meds would benefit her monetarily. She told me it seemed very cut and dry what was happening to me.
3. I have a girlfriend. One of the side effects is low sex drive. I'm not willing to give up a sex drive at 23.
4. There is a bit of a fog there in everyday life for me. I get caught in my thoughts a lot. And I do feel exhausted by the end of the day from all the mental gymnastics I do daily. I was shocked when I was told this wasn't normal. I can't imagine that not being normal because it's all I know.

&amp;#x200B;

I do have an aunt who I know takes Lexapro for her anxiety and my grandpa takes Celexa after he had his stroke and was recovering. My family on both sides is kind of riddled with mental health issues.

97,"Hi there, 

I’m messaging this page as I’m hoping for some advice on something my boyfriend is going through at the moment. 

He’s got put onto antidepressants about 2 months ago. And when he first started taking them, he was clean from drugs and alcohol for a little while. But then he went on a spiral and has started to abuse these substances again. And since then, he has become extremely reliant on drinking. 

I don’t really know how antidepressants work in senses of mixing substances like alcohol and drugs. 
But since he’s gone into a spiral of taking them again, he’s become very offish with me. It’s like I’m constantly walking on eggshells and I’m finding it really hard to communicate with him as I’m scared he’ll just snap and have a go at me. 

Would someone please be able to explain, in further detail, whether I should do anything about this? And what the major effects of taking these substances can do to a persons brain when they’re on antidepressants? 

Thank you",11Apr2019,1

i had this phase about nearly 2 years ago where me and someone i met through friends (we are both girls), would run away from home and just have fun. the police bought us back all the time and it was all i wanted to do. i also smoked and every single time i didn't have one, i would get really angry. i used to hit my mum, but both of us did it, which does NOT make it ok. i just want you to know that both of us were involved. and i also used to hit my brother. it got so bad i had to live with my grandparents for a while. 

&amp;#x200B;

i also got bullied quite a bit. i didn't really have a lot of friends but the ones i did have were much popular than me. we always used to hang out no matter what they were doing. but they always used to tease me and i used to tease myself too but, sometimes it got to me and i didn't tell me. i still haven't. then i tried to kill myself. they teased me for doing that and also self harming. i hated it.

104,"I need help.

The help I’m asking for is humbling, to say the least. But pride is a luxury I can’t afford in this season of my life. Over the past few years, my mental health has been in a downward spiral. And more recently, for about a year, that spiral has sped up aggressively.

My name is Tamara. I’m 32 years old, and I live in Nashville, TN. I work in marketing at a job that I love doing. I don’t have kids or pets, but I do have a few plants that thankfully need minimal attention. I’m an ENTJ and Enneagram 3. I have wonderful friends and high standards for romantic relationships. I am kind, fun, intelligent, silly, driven, resilient, warm, generous, sensitive and playful. I love cooking, being outdoors, hiking, coffee, traveling any chance I get, my book club, my church small group, karaoke, live music, raw oysters, kombucha and candles. It’s a little strange to write that list of activities I enjoy, because I’ve been unable to consistently partake in those activities for some time now.

I am also an alcoholic, and I battle with depression and anxiety – exacerbated by complex trauma and (of course) by alcohol use. When I’m in remission from the former, I enjoy the benefits that sobriety affords me. I guess you could say that I’m more “myself.” When I’m not sober, I am paralyzed by my depression and anxiety – so much so that I cut myself and become suicidal.

I tell you that, not for shock value, but because it’s a truth that I can no longer avoid or write off as being “just a drunken mistake.” I value my life intensely, and I don’t want to die. I want to live a full life, and that obviously requires me to have the ability to consistently take care of myself. I now have to face the difficult and harsh truth – that I don’t have that ability.

Here’s my story as it relates to alcoholism and depression. I’ll warn you that the details are morbid, but there’s no glossy way to describe my experience with a disease that’s inherently ugly.

The first time I cut myself, I was drunk (I was drunk every time I cut myself). I got into a fight with my ex, and when he went to bed, I stayed up crying uncontrollably. I don’t know why the thought to hurt myself entered my mind, but it did, and I took a kitchen knife to my arm. Once I cut, I was able to calm down enough to go to bed. From then on, any time I would spiral into a drunken depression, cutting was my go-to release, and it happened a few more times before I got sober and entered the recovery world.

After the first time, I chose to cut my feet – I think because it was a part of my body I could more easily hide. One night, after cutting too deeply to stop the bleeding, I landed myself in the ER and learned what a “mandatory hold” was. I was released the next morning when they confirmed that I had not been suicidal. At the time, I thought that was a ridiculous question. Of course I wasn’t suicidal. I had just wanted to cut myself… “just.”

I got tired of waking up after each of those episodes with intense regret, shame and withdrawal symptoms. My ex asked me to listen to a podcast called Recovery Elevator, and when I heard my story mirrored in countless others, I decided to get sober and hoped it would be my answer. That was in October of 2017.

It was an answer, to a huge extent. I felt better all-around, I re-gained my productivity, and I felt like me again. But I soon learned that addiction is a complex disease. Actually, at that time, I don’t know if I fully accepted that it is a disease. Sure, I trusted the experts and bought into the classification, but I was still holding onto my belief that if I just tried hard enough – learned enough about it, rolled up my sleeves and worked really hard – that I could beat it.

I was able to string together periods of sobriety – two or three months – before I’d slip. But I’d jump right back on the wagon, convinced I would get it right this time. After one particular slip/relapse, I drank almost a full handle of vodka over the course of a Saturday. This time, I lost all hope that I could remain sober. That familiar intense depression came on, and for the first time since I initially entered recovery, I decided to cut myself again. I ran a bath and got a kitchen knife. As I did, utter hopelessness came over me, and I just knew that I would always be this way. I didn’t want to die, but I couldn’t keep living like this. I recorded a goodbye message for my mom, dad, brother and sister-in-law, and I quickly researched how I could cut a vein and bleed out. I acted, sent the message and went to sleep.

My family intervened (something I am eternally grateful to them for), and I spent 2 nights in the ER and another 3 nights in a mental hospital. That experience was the worst of my life and is a story of its own. After I was discharged from the mental hospital, I checked myself into a 28-day rehab. Following that rehab, I was able to remain sober for about 8-and-a-half months. The last few of those months were a huge struggle. I maintained a happy face and outward façade of doing great, but I was struggling behind closed doors – again battling depression and anxiety, and again gradually losing the ability to stay motivated and productive and to take care of myself in basic ways.

In January of this year, I gave in and relapsed. During my week-long binge, I fell in a parking lot, cut my wrists and ended up in the ER again. I wasn’t necessarily suicidal this time. In fact, I reached out to my support system immediately and got help vetting where I could go for treatment. I knew where the path I was on led, and I knew that I needed help digging out of the hole I had created in just a week. Thankfully, I had a ton of help from amazing friends, and I was able to get into a wonderful alcohol treatment program. Between my insurance and financial help from friends, I was able to stay for 24 days and then complete 9 IOP sessions.

After staying sober for over 2.5 months and working with an incredible sponsor all the way to step 9, you guessed it, I relapsed hard. After a rough week I don’t need to describe in detail, I walked to the liquor store and bought a pint of vodka. I polished that off and walked right back to get another. Another intense bout of depression, another cutting episode, another ER visit (thanks to my sponsor and another friend who called an ambulance when I stopped responding) and another stay in the mental hospital. As hard as it is to admit that I was suicidal, I’d be lying to you and to myself if I didn’t admit that I was hopelessly done again.

That was a week ago, and in addition to searching for treatment options (again, with the help of close friends), I am focused on the excruciating task of taking basic care of myself. And I mean, basic – drinking water, taking my medications, going for a long walk every day, making sure I get sleep. So far, I’m keeping it up and also managing somehow to be productive at my work. But I know well enough now that something has to change, and it has to change now. And I need help. I’ve been trying my absolute best and doing all the extraneous things that are recommended – IOP, self-care, AA, step-work, staying in community, staying spiritually connected, seeing a therapist. This isn’t my first resort… it’s my last.

I’m no genius, but I can do basic math. Over the past year-and-a-half, I’ve had multiple relapses, 3 ER stays, 2 mental hospital stays and 2 stints in rehab. Each time, the cycle has gotten worse, not better. Despite my best efforts, I haven’t been able to do this on my own.

When I initially started writing this, my goal was not to share or publish it. I simply wanted to write it out as an exercise in being honest with myself. However, I’ve come to the same conclusion that those who love me have reached – that this is life or death, and that I need serious help to save my life.

What kind of help am I asking for? I’m not entirely sure, but I do know that long-term inpatient treatment for both addiction and mental health (specifically, addressing trauma and depression/anxiety) is what I need. I’m in the process of exploring options, but treatment isn’t cheap. It’s expensive and, in fact, cost-prohibitive for me. Even with insurance, I’m finding that only a small portion will be covered, or (in more cases) that the places that offer the right kind of help for me aren’t covered at all. Through help from a dear friend and mental health professional, I’ve found a great option, but it’s $30K for 90 days. I don’t have $30K, or even close to that. I’m actually still in debt from the aforementioned treatment I’ve received to-date.

So I don’t really know what to ask for. The obvious help to ask for is money. Does anyone have $30K to give to a complete stranger? The other Hail Mary is this: Are there any treatment centers out there who are willing to offer a scholarship to someone who is both desperate and determined to get help?",11Apr2019,1

120,"So my boyfriend’s best friend is this really chill dude. When I met him, a year ago, he was pretty chipper. Throughout the time I’ve met him, though, we’ve just been noticing he’s becoming different.

He’s only 20 years old, but because he has an inheritance from when his mom passed away, he doesn’t do anything but play video games and smoke weed all day. Not to mention the fact that he’s never left his hometown after dropping out of high school because he had complications with his health. He doesn’t know how to drive, and doesn’t seem like he wants to. He’s never had a job either. His best friend is far behind in life. And I feel like the more that time passes, the less he’s willing to do something with himself.

He’s been single for a while, and the only thing keeping him motivated to do anything was getting a girlfriend. But every time he’s close to finding a girl, she flakes on him. Also, he only seems to want to find a girl through online dating. He never wants to go outside (which could be due to his depression, I’m not sure).

My boyfriend says that after he’s been actually meeting up with girls, that’s when he’s changed the most. The friend keeps pushing my bf away, but my boyfriend says that if he leaves him alone the friend will spiral faster. His friend doesn’t even want to play video games anymore, he just sits there watching videos on YouTube.

2. Can chronic depression go away? Is it something like chronic back pain where it just lingers?

3. How can my boyfriend help his friend? He’s trying to get him out of the house today and taking him to go mini golfing because his friend loves to do that.

4. If being single is the problem, would it even be okay for him to be in a relationship if he’s going to base his mental stability on it? Would it be the healthy way for him to cope?

I want to get a job to pay for therapy. I want to work and stuff. The thing is I have reached a point that I can't do anything. Seriously I even lost interest in everything. I am restless and stressed. I don't know what to do. Family is not an option. r/Assistance rarely help. r/borrow are very strict. No real life friends.

Once again. It's not depression. I am not sad. It's a chronic anxiety and stress that has grown with me since childhood. It has grown to the worse of the worse. Therapy is not expensive in my country, because it's cheap, but the wages are low. My family can't support me in it.


DISCLAIMER: I am not begging for money. I am not hinting that I want someone here to lend me. I just want some guidance. Where can I get help? I don't need big money. If there is a way that I can get from USD 50 to USD 100. It would be enough. The thing is I am unsure about the loan.

Other people have mentioned I haven’t been myself.

I quit one of my jobs this morning thinking I would have to pay back roughly $2000, which I could manage, and it was all making sense to give myself room to breathe, but I just found out I will be owing $12,000. How did I fuck this up? I can’t hardly even cry, I just keep shutting down and staring into nothing. ... I suppose at least now I’m putting words down and thinking about things.

There are so many responsibilities I have to worry about, even after I’ve quit now. I’m so fucked. I’m so absolutely fucked.

I’ve never been this depressed or anxious or made this many big mistakes at once ever before. I’m not the person I used to be. I think the best parts of my mind left or died. And it’s my fault.

I don’t know what to do. 

I don’t see a way for things to get better.

If someone would just please take this pain and stress away and just kill me, I would be so grateful. I’m too much of a coward to do it on my own.

I realize I’m only talking talking about me me me in this post, but I don’t know where else to go or what to do.

I keep thinking I have a plan figured out for a path towards getting better, but I just continue to fail or screw up everything I do now. It didn’t use to be like this. What the fuck happened to the old me. What happened to happiness. Friends. Laughter. Motivation. Love. It’s all fucking gone. I’m slowly losing every good aspect of my life, one at a time.

I’m sorry to those who created me, I most definitely failed to give back to the world. I think I failed to give back to nearly anyone. I think that makes me a bad person and I shouldn’t be here anymore. 

I don’t think I’m going to make it. I’ve lost sight of any happy ending. Hope just died about an hour ago. I don’t even know what’s keeping me going.

Someone please tell me that life can get better. I’m so terrified it’s just going to continue to get worse like it has for so long now. 

At least I’m not staring at a wall now... thanks to anyone who read this and a thanks in advance to those of you who can offer any advice. I’m so fucking scared that I’m not myself anymore, I’m scared I’ll continue to do things I normally wouldn’t, continue to fail, continue to be miserable.

127,"My mother has a family history of mental illness, and has always been a little unstable. Her mother was institutionalized after several suicide attempts (bipolar I believe).
Lately it has gotten much worse. Since I got married and moved out, she has gotten more aggressive with my father. It used to be like entirely verbal when I lived at home.
 Over the last year it has begun to get physical. She has choked, slapped and hit him. She has hit him with a shovel. She just tried to push him out of bed (he just had knee surgery) and hurt his knee. She said he was being lazy. The guy just had his knees replaced! 
It's not all the time. Shes really happy a lot of the time. But she has always gotten these ""moods"", just different now. The smallest thing will completely set her off.
She baby sits my children and my husband is worried about that. She loves them dearly and we know she'd never harm them, we are more worried about them seeing or hearing the way she treats my father.
Even in the presence of others there are very hurtful comments she makes to my father. 
My father is the nicest man in the world and he doesn't deserve this. My mother is nice sometimes and doesn't desvere to live with undiagnosed mental illness. I'm really at a loss.
She won't admit she needs help. She says shes fine and my father is being dramatic. She wont go see anyone, or talk to her doctor about it. She won't admit theres anything wrong at all. She says she isn't ""crazy"" and that my father has turned us all against her. 

I'm 24 and married with two children. Still having to deal with my mothers issues is not how I imagined my adulthood. I love her but I don't know what to do to help her or my father, if I can even do anything. 
My father has given her the ultimatum that she has to get help or get out. He just can't take it any more. 30 years of marriage. 30 years hes been dealing with her emotional and now physical abuse. I want to support my dad but he doesn't know what he can do either. Everyone tells him he has to call the cops, but is that the only option? Is there nothing he can do for her if she wont get help?

128,"I've been through some very harsh times past two to three years, which has caused me to get severely depressed. I was bullied at school my whole childhood and I had a negletting mother with some spices of emotional abuse and manipulation.

Well, six years ago life turned another side and showed me there's other bad things also. Father, who had been sober for 6 years, started drinking again, that caused a lot of drama in our household. I felt alone and unsafe with a side of very drunk parents acting too uncomfortably with me. 

The shit went down after I turned 15 and fathers alcoholism worsened, we were poorer by every day, O developed a depression from the things in the past, most of them occuring still back in the day. After my parents heard about it, they started to attack emotionally on me and started to become more toxic. Dad assaulted me twice, parents turned my family against me and I tried suicide really often. Around 20-30 times during the 2-3 years. I couldn't focus on school because of that. 

After a year had passed, my dad couldn't take any care of our house (I live with just him), I had to take control with the little money and energy I had from work to get food on the table and house as livable as possible.

After all that crap, I decided to take a sick leave from school for a month and I am feeling happy again! It's been so long, I feel healthier. I feel like a superhuman. I'm so glad and thankful I'm still alive. This was a huge wall of text, but I wanted to show you, that it will get better, even if it feels hopeless. Hang in there! It gets better. Don't quit.

130,"TL;DR - I've made a series of decisions in my life that I believe are going to seriously adversely effect my wife &amp; child &amp; I think I've dug myself into a hole that I'm trying to claw my way out of but it's just not working out the way I'm trying. 



Please bare with me thru this rant. I want to apologize if I come off as not needing help or being selfish, I've never opened up to anyone like this. This is a throwaway account btw. This feels very difficult because I feel like I shouldn't' be complaining or venting because my problems are things that everyone has to deal with so I should just get over it. 


I am a 39 yr old male living in the US in Kentucky. I'm not sure where to start &amp; I don't want to inundate this post with info that isn't helpful or useful: When I was in my early 20's back in the 2000s I was in a regular 4 year college and was going to major in graphic design. But, since my grades weren't very good, and by my sophomore year my mother really pressured me to move back to my hometown and just go to culinary school since I had always enjoyed cooking. I did what she advised, moved back home, went thru a culinary program that lasted a year and a half and received an Associates Degree in Culinary Arts. I then worked for 10 years as a line cook at the same restaurant and never really gained any other culinary experience or knowledge from there. I had always been a heavy pot smoker and had dabbled in painkillers here and there but my opiate addiction didn't really become serious until around 2008 when my girlfriend of 5 years left me. At this point in my life I had also started working part time with my father who's an agent with one of the largest insurance companies in the US. 


I eventually quit working at the restaurant and started working at my father's insurance agency full time. Working in insurance was never, and I mean never ever, something that I wanted to do. But, because a lot of my bad habits regarding drugs and partying were associated with working in the service industry, I decided that getting out of cooking for a living would be helpful for my mental and physical health. About a year into working full time in insurance I tried to quit the painkillers cold turkey and had a series of seizures over the next 12 months. A few months before I had my first seizure I started dating a girl (I'll call her Betty) who I used to work at the restaurant with. We eventually got married a few years later in 2012. Btw, Betty was never into drugs at all and only occasionally drank alcohol. Betty has always been adamant about me quitting opiates and has been very supportive thru my recovery process. In 2015 Betty became pregnant (planned) and we now have a wonderful &amp; beautiful little girl.


My problems basically boil down to ""what have I done"", or rather ""what the fuck do I do now"". At least that's what keeps repeating in my head. I really hate working in the insurance industry. From the customer service aspect of it to dealing with people's home and auto claims while also having to try and meet a sales quota each month. This job is taking it's toll on me mentally I feel &amp; do a terrible job of not bringing the work home with me. Some people are great at this kind of work, but, I just don't think I am one of those people and my father has agreed. I've also overhead my 2 co-workers talking about me and they really don't like me working at the agency. I get it, I'm the boss's son, and all of our customers love the idea that I would be taking over the agency once my father retires. My dad says that he has no plans to retire anytime soon but I've heard thru several of my siblings that he's only waiting to retire until I am in a better position at the company we work for and financially in a better place. Right now, like a lot of people around my age, my wife &amp; I live paycheck to paycheck. The company that we work for has made it clear that they aren't going to make me an agent anytime soon and unless I make a big impact on the ""higher ups', then I never will become an agent. I have no passion for insurance and no interest in doing what it takes to become an agent. To do so would mean giving 100% of my available time to this company, which, in no way is my passion and I don't even remotely enjoy any aspect of this job.


About 6 months ago I decided to go back to school and try to earn a degree in CMM. Depending on who you ask CMM stands for 'Coordinate Measuring Machine' or 'Computerized Manufacturing &amp; Machining. Basically, I want to become a machinist &amp; work in CNC manufacturing in some form. I talked about this with my dad and he gave me the go ahead to take off one day a week to start taking classes at a local technical community college. My father let me know, which I don't disagree with, that he would not be helping me financially regarding tuition or hours that I wouldn't be working at the agency. As of right now I am 4 months into taking these classes and I am struggling more than ever to keep my head above water. I thought I was prepared for the classes I would be taking but, it turns out I did not prepare correctly. Yesterday, my professor let me know that because I am just above a failing grade in the 2 classes that I'm taking that I should think about either taking the classes again or to think about a different area of interest to get a degree in. The school I'm attending is a community college and I am barely able to afford the tuition between all of our other expenses like utilities, phone/internet, home and car insurance, mortgage, food, partial daycare (my wife works about 16 hours a week at our daughters daycare which does help) and other expenses that we can't avoid, like paying past debt for instance. We've really tried cutting back the fat so to speak on things we don't need or aren't essential. 


I can't help but think that I'm a giant fuck up. I hate my job, but it pays the bills so I shouldn't complain. I am failing in school at something that I wanted to be my new career. I have no idea how I'm going to pay for my daughter's future and that's not fair to her. The opiate recovery program I'm in wants to help me, and we've been thru 3 separate SSRI's over the past 2.5 yrs that just haven't helped &amp; my co-pay for treatment is another expense. My co-workers have voiced how upset they are that I am taking off one day a week and how much harder it has made their jobs, and I can't blame them for feeling that way. I'm now so broke from paying tuition and our cost of living that without taking out a loan I won't be able to afford tuition for the next semester that I'm not sure now that I'll even be eligible for if I don't pass these current 2 classes. 


There are times when I will find a secluded place or in my car alone on lunch break, and I'll just cry because I don't know how I'm going to be able to pay the mortgage, or how I'll be able to take care of my daughter or what kind of job I'll be able to get once my father finally retires within the next 2-3 years. The 2-3 yr retirement timeline is what I've heard thru the grapevine from my siblings. 

I talk to a therapist and I try to do my best at things like thought stopping when I let negativity get the best of me and staying active and in shape when I have the time. But, all I really want to do is spend time with my wife and child when I get off work. I still have the weekend to try and get as much study time in as I can, which I thought was adequate. But, as school progresses I'm learning that I need more time to study. The last time I was in school was the early 2000's, so just learning how I learn &amp; study has been very complicated. 


In regards to the opiate program, they take a urine sample once a month to make sure I'm not taking anything else than what I'm prescribed. I've quite smoking pot, which was actually a lot tougher than I thought it would be, but, that still good I guess. 

In my mind I feel like I'm just being a cry baby about my situation and should be appreciative that I have it so good. What am I doing wrong? My wife says that I need to get out of a mindset that everything is lost if I fail at school. But, in my opinion, I think that I made so many bad decisions in the past that I'm now reaping what I've sowed, and, as one of my friends put it I need to ""man the fuck up"". If you read all of this I can't say thank you enough and I honestly appreciate the time you've taken. Maybe I didn't post in the right place and if not I'll delete this post.",11Apr2019,1
131,"Hi. I’m 18 and I’ve been struggling with this for awhile. I’m new here, but I solely made this account for help with this. I’ve never been officially diagnosed with anxiety or depression but I’m mostly certain I have one or both. Every time I try and bring it up to my parents or my social worker at school they equate it to something else. They tell me it’s because I’m sleep deprived, or overthinking it. But my issue is that no matter what, I overthink absolutely everything and it leads me to dark places. I know I’m struggling but I don’t know what to do. I wake up every morning with zero enthusiasm or excitement. Somedays I wake up without any will to even live. My life is a constant cycle of me trying to impress my friends in hopes that they can support me and help me through this, but none of them understand and no amount of kind words is enough to make a difference. I know this isn’t true, but for some reason I feel that people perceive me as a nuisance. I try and control myself to not be obnoxious or too forward, but then I never can and it causes me to be sad. A few nights ago, I hit a low point in my life. After thinking back on my four years of high school (I’m graduating in May) I realized how badly I messed up many relationships I’ve had with friends and with girls. It made me sad, and it got to a point where I considered driving without a destination until my car ran out of gas— praying I’d get lost and maybe never come back. I made my friend and his girlfriend pick me up. I sobbed in the back seat, ranting about how I feel alone and how I feel like everyone’s afterthought. They gave me so many kind and encouraging words, but it somehow only changed things for that moment in time. They disputed everything I was saying and couldn’t have been more kind or supportive, yet, I live my life in fear that I’m annoying people and often times I feel like in an effort to be like-able I over-compensate and end up actually being annoying.  I don’t know what to do and I’m truly lost. I’m sad all the time and to say I have no self-confidence or self-worth is an understatement. Insecurity is my middle name and no matter how hard I try I absolutely cannot shake it. Please help me, I’m alone and I feel like I’m drowning and I feel like I don’t even know where to begin. No one believes me because I come off as a kind and happy-go-lucky person but this is a facade I put up to be like-able. Deep down I’m hurting and I’m confused.

132,"27M here.

I went to a psychiatrist for depression and found that I instead have ADHD. I got prescribed Vyvanse. But weird stuff started happening a week after I started taking it.

I've always been a telekinetic (able to move small objects with my mind), but now when I do it, it's painful and accompanied by a high pitched whistling sound.

I feel like my head is connected to my neck on actual squeaky hinges, and I hear a squeak when I move my head up and down that nobody else can hear.

There's also three people following me around everywhere who look like white ghosts. I don't know exactly how to describe what they're like, because they don't let me get a very good look at them. But here's my best attempt. Google the Pokemon Dugtrio. It's three little guys who move together as one unit. The three ghost people I'm seeing are like that except they look mostly human. One's a man and two are women. They stand super close together like they are all part of one body and glide around like that. All three are very pale and wear white robes.

They sometimes appear a few hundred feet away and pretend not to notice me, but then as I start starting, they turn to me and ask me a question in my mind, then disappear when I answer.

I'm seeing improvement in my ADHD and depression symptoms, but I find it concerning that things are happening that are either not real or may be spiritually damning in nature. It's against my religion to commune with spirits, ghosts, etc. I talked to my pastor about the ghosts I was seeing, and she wanted to know if she could see them too. I was looking for them, but they didn't appear for me while I was at church. She said to tell them I am saved by Jesus Christ and to refuse to answer their questions.

I'm looking for advice. Has anyone become even more mentally ill on ADHD medication?",11Apr2019,1

138,"So a LONG LONG time ago now when I was in my teens I first encountered this strange and utterly terrifying experience all of a sudden.

It was as far as I can tell depersonalisation.

But I just wanted to ask your opinion on this because I've only recently put a name to this ""condition"", ""feeling"", ""thing"" after many years of trying my hardest to avoid it.

It seems to me after many years of temporary short term relapses into this that it appears to be caused when I have literally nothing going on in my brain. When the distractions of life go away.

You know you spend most of your day doing stuff. Making breakfast, getting ready, brushing your teeth, working, driving. There is pretty much always something going on in your head.

Depersonalisation happens to me when that stuff stops. Like the first time I remember it was the summer holidays so I had no school, no homework and I'd just come back from my grandparents so at that moment had nothing to do.

So I was in the kitchen standing at the side just finished a conversation with my mum and all of a sudden I had nothing going on. I had no plans, no urgent thoughts, nothing and that is when it first happened.

Now it happens when I'm trying to fall asleep. I'm relaxed, I have nothing much on my mind, I feel it creeping in and I'm in that place again doubting my own thoughts even exist.

Feel like what I imagine a robot feels like trying to divide by zero. Just a futile mental paradox. Then after a bit I can usually ride it out long enough to get a grip back on myself and fall asleep.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is commonly found alongside anxiety or depression etc but I always feel like I don't have it because I have anxiety, I'm anxious of the feeling itself.

Does this sound right to you? Or have I just latched onto the term through wanting to put a name on it?",11Apr2019,3
139,"This is a positive story and I will go through it here because being told it can get better is what kept me going. 

I am 23, male and live in Scotland.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Went to CBT, got a bit better. Went to Person Centred, got more better. Now I'm pretty good. Also I got all my support from charities and the nhs. 

&amp;#x200B;

Three years ago I was in my last year of Uni. I had thought spirals, stayed in bed for days, didn't eat or wash. You know this story. I graduated and felt nothing. I lost touch with friends. I didn't go out. It pretty much ruined my life for about two years. 

I started doing CBT with an awful online thing. It taught me to think about my mind in a way I hadn't thought of, and with the tools I learned I dug myself out of those holes and became functional; able to avoid the worst spirals and cope with the worst pits. This took more than a year, and I am still learning. 

&amp;#x200B;

After that for a long time I just didn't feel anything. I had learned to cope with the worst of it, but I was unable to feel happiness most of the time; everything grey. It sucked, frankly. I would struggle through things, actually achieve things, but not get any satisfaction. Not good. 

Looking to try and address this situation I went to the nhs and they eventually took me through to see a human CBT practitioner. This took about 5 months. He spoke to me twice and basically told be that I was functional and therefore beyond what CBT could do for me. If I interpret it charitably. If I do not interpret it charitably he told me that my problems weren't worth their time. This wasn't unreasonable because the nhs is so underfunded, but it was a bummer. 

I floated around for a while trying to figure out what to do next. I continued to force myself to do things and continued to feel no satisfaction. I would distract myself by filling my mind with youtube and videogames in every spare moment. If I didn't my mind would sometimes take to tearing its self apart because of tiny and pointless regrets from my past. I was no longer at my lowest, but this seemed to be my plateau for the foreseeable future. This was deeply terrifying in a way I cannot describe. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tried a few things on my own, but nothing worked. The dread was getting worse. The thing which was keeping me functional was the hope that it would get better. I could not go on like this. I realized that I should try and seek out some other type of therapy, but I didn't have the money to afford professional therapy. 

It was around this time that I was speaking to a friend of mine who is a psychotherapy phd student. She did voluntary work as part of her course, and explained to me that there are these things called Crisis Centres, which you can go to if you cant afford therapy. Turns out all the phd students have to clock an insane number of contact hours to get their papers, and this keeps organizations like crisis centres supplied with therapists. 

In January of this year I actually found the crisis centre in my home town partly by accident while I was looking for a job. While in one breath I was asking about employment, in the next I ballsed up and asked if this is where I should come for therapy. The therapist agreed to see me, and I started going twice a month. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is now April, and the world has started to regain some of its colour. Not in spikes, like it does in my occasional mood swings, but gradually. Since starting the therapy I have been feeling more and more able to deal with things, and this has created a snowball effect. The therapy itself has helped me feel feelings again, and while that has included good and bad, the extra willpower I have gotten from it has meant that I can start actively addressing the other problems in my life while in a more balanced state. I cannot describe it. 

The other night I went to bed and caught myself smiling because my bedsheets were so soft.

140,"The past few years have been tough. Some days it all feels a bit much.

My Dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s a few years ago and is currently in palliative care. He doesn’t have very long to go.

A year ago I found out I was donor conceived. Who I know as my dad isn’t actually my biological dad.

Along with that news, came the news that I have 7 half siblings, one of whom passed away a few years ago.

A few weeks ago a close friend experienced a very traumatic series of events, that resulted in me taking her to hospital, once I discovered she had an active suicide plan. She got through it, and is now stable. She told me that I saved her life. 

My sister is struggling a lot with anxiety and everything that’s happened with Dad. I worry about her a lot because she tends to bury things and retreat, rather than sharing or talking about it. 

I run a small business with my sister that comes with frequent challenges. I love it, and am in it for the long haul, but it’s incredibly stressful. We didn’t start with any money, and 10 years later we have 8 staff and exciting things ahead. I constantly worry about losing what we’ve built.

My husband and I have to move from our current rental house in the very near future. We rent from a member of my family who has been incredibly insensitive about my Dad’s illness. (My Dad’s sister.....) We need to get out to minimize the stress this causes me. Money is always a worry.

My mum was offered an incredible opportunity to work overseas and my sibling and I encouraged her to take it, despite her fear and hesitation about being so far from Dad. She deserves it and we are so happy and proud of her - but there is a tiny tiny part of me that feels like I’m losing both parents at once.

In both sides of my family there are issues of alcoholism, drug abuse, gambling, and more. All of these issues weigh on me, and affect the members of my family care about.

I’ve had depression for about 20 years. I’ve been through therapy, antidepressants, and find it easy to talk about stuff with my husband and friends. I feel supported. I feel loved. I feel worthy. 

Yet still, I’m overwhelmed.

141,"I have pretty bad anxiety and it just keeps getting worse. I always assumed it was just social anxiety, but I am not sure at this point because I sometime feel anxious for no reason. I was recently dropped from the nursing school program I was in because my anxiety made it to where I kept for getting things during my checkoffs. I decided to take a break from school, but that has honestly made my anxiety worse and made me feel like a failure.

143,"I recently joined this subreddit about 3 months ago and posted once. It was around the time I started to actually pay attention to my emotions and trying to identify them and feel better. I guess I was stuck in the 'be a man' mentality and tried to constantly suppress my feelings. When my Nanny, Poppy and Dad all passed away in a 4 year span I did not really have a reaction or grieve at all, looking back I tried to put on a strong face for my brother and mom who were having a tougher time with the losses. After all of this and staying in the same rut of not really working out and slowly gaining weight back that I had previously lost I had realized that I actually hated where I was at. Around this time, weed became legal so I began smoking often and being high helped me start to single out each emotion and I was able start cooking for myself instead of eating fast food and I recently returned to the gym. I feel the best I have in years and am extremely hopeful that this continues.

144,"My mind(much like many other before me) is constantly buzzing with thoughts. Some good some bad and some just right down the middle. These “buzzing” thoughts tend to trigger my anxiety and I end up portraying a version of myself that I hate. This version isn’t terrible or anything it’s just less confident and always trying to appease others, to the point where I’m constantly just helping others and not paying attention to myself.

In being this way I have lost touch with what I see as “my true self”, and it takes tons of work to get back to a level ground. Is there anything hat has helped you direct you “buzzing” mind/thoughts in a healthy way?",11Apr2019,1

146,"I've been suspended from my college and had to go back home. In order for me to reapply, I need to talk with a counselor (or licensed clergy, not sure what that means though). I went to school in Minnesota, so I have health insurance there but I don't have insurance where I currently reside (Harris County/Southwest Houston). I'm also very low-income, so cost is what's preventing me from going where ever. Does free counseling even exist???",11Apr2019,1
147,"I believe that for two years I have been experienced more obvious symptoms of depression - often low mood, no interest in anything, hard to get  out of bed in the morning, changing jobs, mind getting void when talking to people, staring in one point for prolonged time, moaning as every tasks was hard to impossible to start and finish, feeling empty.... Symptoms varied trough the day - usually it was the worst in the morning and better in evening-, but they were there. Sometimes, although rarely, I felt completely OK, but this didn't last more than few hours or more than a day. 

However, the symptoms apparently kept getting worse, which may not be so surprising as I was placed in foreign country with very cold culture, without any friends, without partner, without anybody speaking to me, not even coworkers. My life consisted only from work-to-house routine and I truly hated my job. It was kind of torture that I traded for money. For some reason I didn't even speak to my friends or family trough phone, I just pushed them away.

The symptoms were probably getting worse and I was able to observe troubles with identity, frustration, not knowing in which direction to go, increased challenge to make decisions, and I started to sleep over day. Also I consumed a beer a day to feel more cheerful, and in worst days I had consumed two redbulls per day so I was able to perform my work. I had also introduced coffee, although I don't like coffee. It also seemed that my mind became less stable and very moody. I as well got feelings of anger for no apparent reason. I also got some general thoughts about ""ending it altogether"", however it was very general moaning, and not like a suicide thought in my opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

Few months later, during the winter, some strange thing happened. I opened PC, and saw my friend on FB being on a party, surrounded by young chicks and having a good time. Not sure what exactly happened on that night, but I know that my insecurity backfired some kind of shitstorm. I was lying paralysed in bed for few days, and in the night of that event for few hours I was shaking, I was catching breath, my heart was pounding, I had diarrhoea, I wanted to throw up but couldn't. I can also recall that I had some thoughts about ending life. In fact I stared trough window (i lived in a tall building) and possibly thinking in a hypothetical way ""what if I would jump..."". However, I never approached the window, neither opened it. Not sure how to explain this in the means of suicidal attempt, but I can tell you that I am very indecisive and impulsive person, and that I often make decisions randomly, probably subconsciously,  under the pressure, in last minute. In life I barely plan anything. So when you take this factors in account and apply it to my window situation, - although I flirted with window for no more than 10 minutes, - I believe that anything could happen in that moment. I believe it's totally an impulsive thing,  rather than a planned event.

Nevertheless, I called my psychiatrist and informed him about situation and ended hospitalised for no more than two weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

After a month or so, another event happened. Probably it was again fired by insecurities, but this time I've heard a voice telling me to cut myself with a kitchen knife. The voice sounded so real, but as I knew that's not possible. Quickly I got up from bed and run for my life to ER. I wasn't hospitalised.

&amp;#x200B;

Since then I have been very scared for my life. I kept hanging around in public places packed with people knowing that nothing can happen there to me and when walking over bridge I distanced from the edge as much as possible. I am also scared of windows, and to some degree sharp objects. In this period I've also had some unusual anger outbursts, getting in arguing with people while knowing that this can get me in troubles, and that it's bad for me. Yet I did it.

&amp;#x200B;

There was another event following in two weeks. I was in my room staring trough window, and maybe I slightly heard in my head like I was telling to myself to jump. Window was closed and I was distanced from the window. However, this time I saw a short movie playing in front of my eyes, which appeared to be in gray colour and was played with increased speed; I saw how I am moving from my current position trough window. It was kind of suggestion.

In the next moment I moved all the furniture in front of window, completely barricading it. Then I went on first plane and headed it for my home. One of the best reliefs I've ever felt.

&amp;#x200B;

While at home with my family and friends and back in welcoming society, most symptoms disappeared on first day. However, I started to wake up in nights and sleep in evenings .  I am still having some flashbacks seeing myself how I fell from building and hit the floor. Some friend told me that I look traumatised while the other that I something changed in me.

&amp;#x200B;

And finally, I don't know how to understand all this saga. Was my life really in danger? Currently I see all of this in two perspectives, that depend on how do I feel and this can change in few hours. If I feel OK, then I see everything that I went trough as a joke, but if I get that strange pressure in my stomach, weak knees and start to feel sleepy, then everything becomes real.",11Apr2019,1
148," 

This concerns a very close friend of ours, I will refer to him as “Jake”.  We have all been friends for 15 odd years since the beginning of elementary school and have always been very close. For the most part, we were his only group of friends and he was generally uncomfortable talking to new people or socializing at school. We started noticing some changes in his personality about 4 years ago (when he was a Junior in high school) and it’s definitely gotten worse. His dad is abusive verbally, sometimes physically, and definitely emotionally. He is an absolute controlling psychopath who has never been on Jake’s side and disallows him from seeing professional help.

Jake was the only one of our friend group who moved a considerable distance away for college and at first we thought this was a good thing because he would be away from his dad, but his mental state only worsened, possibly because he did not have us around anymore. He struggled finding friends at school, but eventually found some people to be social and room with.  However, for whatever reason, this group kicked him out of their house which definitely worsened his insecurities. His grades suffered along with his social life making it difficult to find anything positive at school. This probably would have all been tolerable had he not been medically disqualified from his ROTC program at school (which was a dream of his for a long time).  

These problems obviously are stacking up and as his only real friends, we have listened and tried to help him through all of it.  Our help however has really only been letting him vent, offering basic advice and letting him know we’re here whenever he comes home. However, even in coming home for breaks his insecurities remain and affect everyone (for example about 4 months ago he was convinced that one of his closest childhood friends hated him, which came out of nowhere and was totally untrue). More recently, he has shown extreme signs of depression and loneliness as well as allusions to suicide or running away (especially when he drinks).  So, as college students with no real experience with this kind of stuff, we’re hoping someone has any advice at all. We know that getting professional help would be very beneficial but as we mentioned earlier his dad forbids it and when asked simply do it at college without telling anyone he said he personally would never go…? He is coming home for the weekend and our plan is to have some sort of group talk with him to try to understand and fix his problems. If you guys have any suggestions about what to bring up/suggest or any advice for us and Jake at all please let us know.  Thanks so much for your time.",11Apr2019,2
149,"I was recently (like.. last year so I guess it's not really recent anymore) diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and PTSD after I witnessed a murder in January 2018. Before the incident I had struggled with depression and anxiety for years, but I was coping alright, I thought. Looking back, I have most likely fit the BPD diagnosis since high school.

Since starting EMDR for my PTSD symptoms I've found it extremely difficult to moderate my own emotions and it's starting to wear on me. Throw in Wedding planning, unstable employment, and every day stress and I feel like I'm about to fly off the handle/go 100% insane every. Single. Day.

150,"The title says it but I’ll say it anyway to elaborate. Basically, I’ve been having urges or thoughts about stuff that’s just morally or socially wrong. At first I thought, “It’s probably just chance/natural.” But it happens around once a day. 

Now, I’d like to start off by saying that I’m not sure if urges is the right word, hence the question mark. I have never once done any of these actions and after I get these “urges” I just scoff them off and never think about doing that thing again because I know either it’s dumb or impossible, or just wrong.

Generally, it’s stuff that’s wrong but not horrible. For example, I’d want to just get naked in the middle of class or go livid on a teacher and yell at them. However, sometimes it gets as bad as wanting to kill someone or kidnap them. Another thing is it also seems to happen at almost the exact same time each day, but there are outliers. Additionally, ones that have to do with actions towards one person almost always aren’t focused at family or friends or even peers. Often it’ll be some random undescript person that I came up with on the fly.

Is this normal? I know that I’ve never wanted to do these actions, nor intend to. However, I still feel I should be concerned.

TL;DR for the ones who want to get a small picture: I get urges(?) to do stuff that is morally wrong to random people. It’s somewhat frequent and varies in how ‘bad’ it is.",11Apr2019,2
151,"It broke me as a human. I met so many vile, disgusting, evil, sociopathic people. Experienced isolation, panic attacks, bullying, racism, public humilation, academic injustice and sabotage from peers, depression.

152,"I live in another state now, but my Father recently reaxhed out to me about the increasing severity of my mother's paranoid delusions. I will be consulting my psychiatrist for help, but wondering is you have any personal experience to add.

She ( F, 59, Hispanic) 
has for a while, felt that people (government or likewise) are using technology to track and watch her. She started a few years ago with turning out the lights when she showers or uses the restroom because people are watching her through the lights. More recently people are watching her through her phone, cameras are covered by stickers and turned off when she is not using it. She is worried at the store or out that people in charge are talking about her or watching her to wait til she does something wrong.

The turning point, during holidays she thought family was spying on her and talking about her because they were on their phones.

The brother she trusts tried to talk to her but without success. She thinks the doctor or therapists are going to contact 'them' and same with her priest.

I've tried going to a counsellor, going to anxiety groups at my school and one on one sessions at school, none of which have helped in any way. my anxiety has only worsened recently because of upcoming exams. I feel constantly paranoid about whether i've done something correctly, or if im a good person, or what other people think of me. I put up a sort of Facade while around other people. I struggle to empathise with others. I spend every day surrounded by people who i am supposed to have either a familial relationship or friendship with, yet i always feel alone, no matter how many 'friends' i am with. I have little to no work ethic because of how well i did earlier in life without even trying and am failing now because of that. I dont think ive felt genuinely happy for at least a year. I don't want to die, but I don't want to live either. I constantly feel as though the world would be better off without me, that no one would so much as bat an eyelid if i just stopped existing one day. I actively try to destroy the relationships i built back when i was not like this. I purposefully do things that might make people hate me, in the hopes that they will. There is a girl i know who i have always liked, but i've never asked her on a date, in case she says yes. Throughout most of my years of life, i have lied almost non-stop, and now that I have broken that habit, i am constantly in fear that people think I am lying. I convince myself that i must be lying about things concerning my own well being, even when i know them to be true. I hate suffering like this, completely alone, but i dont want to involve other people because it'll just end badly.
