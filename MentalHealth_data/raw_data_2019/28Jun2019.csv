0,"Basically, how do I approach the subject with my manager? My main concerns (i.e. what's going to affect my work) are needing to take breaks to calm myself down from a panic attack, and the unfortunate inevitability of me not being able to get out of bed. 

I just graduated, this is my first adult job, and I don't know how this kind of situation is normally approached.

2," Depression is dangerous. (I know, hello captain obvious, right?) But I don’t think people understand just how dangerous it is. One second you’re fine, possibly even flying high. The next you’re on rock bottom struggling to even take another breath. They don’t understand why we don’t cry for help. (Despite, being told we're crazy when we do.) We don’t reach out because we already feel like a burden or a nuisance. Asking for help makes us feel like an even bigger problem. **In our most desperate hour of need the last thing we can bring ourselves to do is the only thing we want to do… cry out for help.** I am a *problem*, a *burden*, an *inconvenience*, and a *nuisance*. I’m not worth disrupting someone’s life. **My life is less valuable than their convenience**. In these moments of depression my worst critiques become my biggest realities. I am fat, ugly, stupid, hateful, a monster, and selfish. In a world of acceptance we aren’t accepted. People with mental illnesses are pushed back in the closet and told to keep silent, that its all in our heads and to just get over it. Well, I don’t intend to keep silent any longer. My pain is real and it’s worth addressing.

It is my belief that people refuse to acknowledge mental illnesses because they either have to do something or do nothing. If they do **something** then they will be **inconvenienced**. If they do **nothing** then they will feel **guilty**. Everyone wants to talk about how sad it is when someone commits suicide, but they don’t want to do anything to prevent it. I’m not asking you to volunteer your Saturdays away answering the suicide hotline, all I’m asking is take 5, 10, 15 minutes to read an article on the signs of depression. I’m asking you to pay attention to the people around you and their body language. You never know, it might save your kid’s friend or your friend’s kid or **your kid**. I’m asking you to listen when someone is brave enough to open up to you, and not tell them to just get over it. I’m asking you to take this seriously. Suicide is the second leading cause of death for ages 10-34. That age range has grown significantly in recent years. I’m asking you to show a little compassion and consideration for your fellow human.

3,"Hello everyone.
As the title states, I'm suffering from ARFID, Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder. It's pretty self-explanatory. From what I understand, it comes in different forms, like fearing from getting sickness from eating food or chocking on it, to outright refusing to eat certain foods which they have never tried before, which is the case with me. But, it's very very severe, at least in my opinion. Just to give you an example:
My usual breakfast is some bread with honey, and my lunch is either nuggets, French fries, macarons, rice, and the occasional pizza or crepe. And most times, I don't even have dinner because of the lack of options. That's how severe it is. Even in chips, I'll only eat salt and vinegar, salt, and cheese. No other flavours. I can't really go to a mental health doctor, as I'm quite young, certainly under legal age to live by myself and have sex and well, be an adult, and, if I ever tell my parents about my any mental disorders I'm 99% sure I have from research I did, I'd probably be told not to say that, and that I'm just over-reacting, as my parents like to be somewhat optimistic when it comes to these things, and even deny them. It has happened more than once, although rarely, that I want to try a certain food but upon touching, smelling or seeing them outside of pictures I instantly lose all interest. This can also be a problem while ordering from fast-food places, as I don't eat burgers nor anything like pepper, onions, even spices added to foods. So I think it would be safe to assume that I have ARFID or some other similar mental issue, either that or I'm just stupid and the pickiest human being in existence. So, when I found this subreddit, I instantly decided to get some advice on how to deal with it. I hope I'm not asking too much of the people in here, but I really just want some help that I cannot be offered anywhere else in my current circumstances, at least that I know of. Thank you for reading through this and I hope you have a nice day!",28Jun2019,1
4,This is probably the most important appointment I’ve had so far with a family doctor.  It was so hard to open up to her a few months ago about what was happening in my life without crying. I just found a wonderful therapist and finally was able to see a psychiatrist that has sent her report to my GP. I’m happy to finally take the next step and decide on different options and routes in terms of healing.  I guess I was wondering if there was something I should ask my GP that maybe people forgot to ask or is not brought up or anything really I should ask.,28Jun2019,1
5,"I don’t remember the day I became suicidal. I don’t remember what the last straw was. I don’t remember the first time I thought “I just don’t want to be alive.” But I do remember nearly jumping to my death at a concert. I remember being overwhelmed with the longing for death in that moment (and so many more). I remember being happy and still wanting to die. I remember laughter and joy and sadness and emptiness all in the same moment. I remember counting out ten pills before pouring the entire bottle in my hand. I remember laying down after taking those pills…. then waking up in the hospital two days later. Even in the happiest and best moments in my life I was suicidal. See, a smile doesn’t mean “okay”. Yes, I was happy. Yes, I was having fun. Yes, I was suicidal. I don’t think of it as much as I use to. I don’t get that overwhelming longing for death. I’m starting to see a future for myself… and just maybe I’m not suicidal anymore...

but suicide is still the second leading cause of death for ages 10 to 34 in the U.S. It still takes tens of thousands of lives every year. Maybe, some of those suicides could’ve been prevented if a loved one in those peoples’ lives had understood. Maybe, some of those people would still be with us if someone in their lives had saw the signs.

I’m proof that things can get better. I’m proof that suicide isn’t always the answer. It’s still a struggle, though. There are still bad moments. There are still suicidal thoughts. But for once in a very long time I want to be alive.",28Jun2019,3
6,"First of all, I am not depressed. I do, however, fixate and tunnel vision on things intensely. For example, I shall fixate on something and disregard all else. Recently it has been mountain climbing, I spent from 5pm-2:30am watching mountain climbing documentaries the other night. In a social situation, if someone mentions something and my mind fixates on it, I can't seem to focus on anything other than that, and I shall just ramble about this specific thing. I am wondering if this sounds like any mental illness that anyone has heard of. I don't think it's Aspergers because I am rather well situated in social situations, and have no issue showing my emotions/understanding the emotions of others. It's just this fixations issue, I just hone in on something and can't seem to shake it from my brain.",28Jun2019,1
7,"I had a complete breakdown today. I have them somewhat often.. but today was different. 

&amp;#x200B;

The beginning of my panic attack was the same as it always is: starts with something triggering an emotional response (difficult convo with boyfriend) and extremely negative self-talk (I'm unlovable). My panic attacks can last hours. Within the first 15 minutes however, I stopped for a second and hugged myself (physically) and said out loud ""it's okay"" while petting my head. I don't know where it came from. I usually spiral things out of control and beat myself up for being crazy. But today I simply allowed myself to feel sad and felt compassion for myself, like I would a friend, instead of hate.

&amp;#x200B;

I pride myself in being kind and loving toward people. Today I cried for being so, so terrible to myself. I realized, for the first time ever, that I deserve better.

It does explain a lot but at the same time I just don't want to believe it, I mean, how could I believe it?! 

They told me before that I was Bipolar, OCD, ADHD and other minor stuff and they were wrong and I got so much better, even so that my therapist was amazed when I came back to a session after a year of not going. I singlehandedly without therapy or medication dragged myself out of depression and addiction, concluded my studies and I haven't had a single relapse in more than a year!
But this just makes so much sense, and I'm connecting the dots on a lot of things that have happened and I kinda see the logic.

Idk what to do or think anymore, I've been struggling lately with a strong feeling that my friends secretly hate me and I don't wanna waste anyone's time with this cuz I fear they'll think I'm relapsing or something. I'm just so confused.

10,I just broke up with someone who admittedly was being kinda self absorbed. I was trying to understand the relationship dynamics and came across the concept of a covert narcissist.

12,"Hi. 23M, Kentucky. Sorry for the length. Right now I'm feeling motivated enough to let someone know about me, so here goes.

 About a month and half ago, GF of more than 2 years broke up with me to move back out of state after getting her undergrad. I had been living with her for the past year and we had a great relationship, but it ended because she had better opportunity in her home state to get enough experience to pursue Grad school. 

I moved back home with my parents in my small hometown. Student loans/car repairs have kept me from building up a 6 month emergency fund that I would want to be comfortable enough to move out, but I've slowly made progress. I imagine I'd have enough by November if I'm being realistic. Until then I'm stuck in my hometown, where all my friends (of whom I didnt have many) have moved out of. So essentially I'm alone in my hometown, but I do socialize with an old friend online some weekends and do drive a bit to go see my another friend once a week to workout with him. My best-best friend seems to have changed and doesnt seem to want to hang out anymore, especially after moving out of our hometown.

I graduated with my undergrad a little more than a year ago and have been working at a government position for almost as long. I went to school to and got a degree in media, with hopes of doing film stuff, but my position has been doing largely corporate videography with a limited budget for my government position. We are getting some new equipment soon after a year of waiting, so I guess that will be a bit exciting.

Anyways, now for the reason I'm here. It's no secret that I've battled depression since high school. I also have ADHD. I'm socially awkward/quiet, so I never made a lot of friends in any of my schooling. Generally, I just see this as people genuinely dont want to hang around me/I'm not worth their time. Additionally, I feel as though I made a big mistake in my career choice. I believe it will be very difficult for me to make a good living beyond what I'm already making unless I get lucky. 

As a quick recap on my battle with depression. I've had 2 really bad periods of my depression, though it never really went away outside of these periods. The first one began towards the end of my relationship with my first girlfriend. It was a relationship in which I was emotionally manipulated/abused a lot. During that relationship I did do some self harm. I'm ashamed to say it, but shortly after the last time we broke up in our off and on relationship, I came the closest I'd been to trying to killing myself. Tried to overdose on my ADHD meds (unlikely it would have killed me) and cut up both my arms (I didnt cut them up enough to bleed enough to die). I guess I wasnt ready to die, as I told her what I had done (I think we were having a big fight) and she came over and patched me up and convinced me to get help. She definitely had worse depression aswell as anxiety issues so mental health was something she was familiar with struggling with. 

What I ended up doing was eventually getting help with my University's free therapy/counseling. Over the course of the next two or so months, I went to therapy weekly. I really laid it all out to my therapist, which I guess was cathartic.
They convinced me to change my habits (stop being a hermit) and I joined a film club. Now at this point, I dont think I was really over my past girlfriend yet, but I was definitely doing better. Eventually, I made some friends there. 

Fast forward, I eventually worked up the courage to ask out one of the friends I'd made there. We hit it off. The only issue was, I never really learned how to get over my previous girlfriend. My feelings only went away after I replaced them with my new girlfriend.

Two years later, I dont think about that old girlfriend anymore, but I still think about my latest ex atleast once a day. It's hard not to because all of my most recent good memories were with her. It just happens on accident and I'm reminded of my current situation. I was really in love with her, and I got my heart torn out. I mainly just get sad because I compare how happy my life was back then to my life now. A lot of my socializing was through my ex and her friends, so that's gone too. Now I'm mostly alone.

Heres where I'm conflicted: It seems that one week/day I'll be fine for the most part. Then after one bad thought or a really exhausting day at work, I'll be in despair. Suicidal thoughts, questioning my existence, etc. The thing is I really hate talking about this kind of stuff in person with people I know. The friend I workout with knows I've been depressed, but I havent talked to anyone else about it. I definitely havent mentioned the suicidal thoughts. I can maybe afford it, but I feel it would trap me from moving out.

I got somewhat motivated a few weeks ago and got a gym membership and for a couple weeks worked out and changed my diet drastically to lose a few pounds. Then an old back injury flared up and I had to stop. I got depressed and started eating like crap again. I find that when I'm sad or stressed, it's my coping mechanism. At this point. I feel like what is stopping me from killing myself is that im living for others so that they do not get put in pain by me ending my life. 

TLDR: GF broke up with me. No friends I can social daily with. Intermittent suicidal thoughts, not sure if therapy is worth my small amount of money I was putting back to move out.",28Jun2019,1
13,"It's not other peoples' place to define and label the experiences of people having a hard time, or turn their problems in some social crusade. Personally I don't think being unhappy, anxious, angry, lost, or emotionally unstable is similar to having a cancer you just need to battle. Mental health isn't something you cure, and just thinking happy thoughts, eating right, and exercising isn't always the answer. 

Instead of people saying ""let's all rally around these mentally sick people who are disabled and need to just go to the gym and eat kale"", I wish people were saying, ""hey, life can really suck sometimes, and let's try to be respectful, non-judgmental, and emphatic toward people who are going through a rough time because at some point or other our life could get tough too."" Or maybe better yet, ""let's collectively try to identify and address the social issues that cause large numbers of people to feel hopeless, unstable, lost, and hurt.""

I was diagnosed with Tourettes syndrome at age 9 I think, but I never had verbal tics and my grades were good in school, so my parents never decided to do anything about it. However, I just haven’t really felt happy or normal for a while now (the past year and a half I guess). I read a few articles online that cited studies where 60-80% of children that were correctly diagnosed with tourrettes were also found to have ADHD.  I hate people that self diagnose blindly, but I feel like I probably have it due to my Tourettes along with a few other things. I’m kind of straying from the point, but I’ve had lots of problems with depression and anxiety for the past year and half, and I was wondering wether ADHD could be a cause for other mental problems.",28Jun2019,1
17,"Hi, I'm not sure where to start with this post or if this fits here. A little about me, I've spent all of my childhood to now never leaving the house. I didn't go outside unless it was for school and then work. Now that I've been unemployed since April, I've realized how depressing things are. I've been spending the time unemployed enjoying myself, thinking I have all the time in the world to apply to jobs and be quickly interviewed and accepted. I've been trying for three weeks now to get a job and only one person has called me back.

Also three weeks ago, I've started focusing on things I've been wanting to do for a long time. I started a youtube channel and upload somewhat regularly. I started planning for a comic idea I've had for the past two years. And I started exercising to lose weight. But I feel that isn't enough, like I need to do more and more.

&amp;#x200B;

What started this was my brother getting kicked out of the house three weeks ago and moving in with his girlfriend and her three kids (she lives with her grandparents).

I met my now fiance about a week after I started a year long trip in South America. I'm 31, she's 27.

We decided to travel together to see how things go. And a month later we were engaged. I've been married before, and didn't plan on moving too fast with anyone, but I just couldn't help but ask her. When you know what you want you know what you want.


I knew she had a hard past with family and with relationships. Her parents didn't deal well with emotions. She always felt she wasn't good enough in there eyes. When she was 17 she had a bad break up and to be short, her bf pushed her out of bed, which was high up, and she was almost paralyzed. She told the paramedics she wanted them to help her commit suicide. They took her to get physical and mental help, when her dad found out he slapped her. She's had bad relationships, usually for one to four years, often violent. She was in therapy for a year after ending a four year relationship. With the help of her therapist she realized she always sacrificed her happiness for the guy. She had no hobbies, her world revolves around them, self worth issues also. In the middle of the year of therapy she started dating a guy who was the same as her ex. The therapist tried to warn her, but it didn't work. In the end of the 10 months with him, she couldn't handle him having another girl immediately after the break up and started stalking him, and planning how to murder him. She expressed it to me with real regret. She was ill, she knew it. She was really embarrassed to tell me. I thought it's just a way to cope, and more of a fantasy. But it did surprise me.

22,"I am incapable of having a normal conversation with any human either in person, talking on the phone,or via text. All three forms have their own issues and barriers. The only person i can just flow and run it with is my 9 year old son-who happens to be extremely mature intellectually for his age. 
To begin, my mom understands my inability conversate effectively on any topic that requires Anything more than a direct answer or response. She lets me just talk all over the place and has learned how to get the point and she understands me. I struggle with desiring so badly to communicate with and talk to people either in my small friend circle, in public, and generally in society (EXCEPT for work- this is a crazy phenomenon that i cannot explain, when i clock in, something in my brain changes and i feel like I shift personalities. I'm a server and for some reason at work I'm a different person all together.
I Have 20 to 50 short convos daily and can flow perfectly with guests and coworkers, BUT as soon as I clock out I instantly physically and personality-wise feel different. It feels so relieving when I walk out the door because I no longer have to front and (to me) put effort into pointless conversations just to impress guests for bigger tips or simply function at work in general. I want for these conversations to be meaningful to my personal life and boost my social confidence but it does not. I wish I could remember all the stories my guests tell me but I just forget. I feel guilty and like a bad listener so Ill sometimes try to remember by replaying scenarios in my head to trigger even the slightest story. It never works and winds up leaving me slightly let down. Rarely this shuts me out to my strong desire to communicate efficiently and I start to dwell on my issues and dread (yet hope for) the next time I have to talk to anyone. Anyway when conversations do arise whether im at the grocery store or something, in random convo like at the park, or even at lunch with friends, I make sure to apply some of the skills I read in a book a few years ago about improving communication by focusing on being a good listener rather than a selfish listener, - surprisingly developed some new habits. I actively listen to whomever I'm communicating with by using eye contact, nod, only interject at appropriate times with relevant feedback or correlating experiences, facts or personal knowledge which pertains to whatever they're talking about, and sometimes ill bring up relatable life events or similar topics (please note that i do this without turning the conversarion over to me talking much and making it about me) yet i never know when theyre completely finished speaking and it's my turn to start conversating on my ideas, how begin my point of view, how to develop a good opening statement to start me off or give an idea about what i wanna say, nor do I feel confident that's its indeed my turn to talk and that I actually have the floor. Oppositely, the time will come when I'll just know nows my turn, here we go, fuck what's an intriging opening statement, just play it cool and start talking! BUT cannot for the life of me find a transitional phrase or basic beginning statement when it's my turn to talk. This causes anxiety and embarrassment but i want so badly to just fuckin talk to people. Somehow I'll begin talking about something that requires 2 or so backgroung stories for them to fully understand, this background info entails another 1 or 2 stories that'll further put them in the light about the subject but im scared and contemplating whether or not if I wanna put in the effort to relay these cool facts for fear of losing track of my point and getting lost in talking. I do address these side stories 40% if the time. Also, another barrier or obstacle is that i have a high vocabulary so this entails frequent pauses because plenty of times people are lost so then I have to give definitions for clarity and then remember what I was initially saying and how I was doing so at that point in convo. So here I usually land--- somewhere in the middle of trying to express a complete original thought( which makes so much sense in my brain), while simultaneously providing relevant (and contemplating the related but not always necessary ) background info- which said story half the time has a completely different background story in itself and i get distracted and begin a whole different story/topic/story/point. The entire time I'm observing my listeners body language searching for signs of aggravation, boredom, or impatience while simultaneously trying to tie all of my words together in an attempt to express my scattered thoughts which all together must lead to getting my point across- that is IF i haven't began whole different story and get lost in that. sometimes i do notice that I'll slowly start getting off of the main topic so I'll jump back and fix it. and sometimes i end up rambling, when- unbeknownst to my knowledge ill change my whole path of conversation to something that is like a life lesson regarding a quick background story and my point then becomes about the side topics lesson and i forgot what i even began with. all the while im secretly hoping the listener doesn't notice. All in all, I usually start with one story and end up juggling how to conclude my now 2 points, incorporate mentioned 3 or so relevant or relatable topics that were previously addressed, and finish what im saying without being a bore, annoyance, or being that kind of  person who blabbers for 10 minutes and doesnt relay any useful information. However, I usually judy get lost in thought when trying to conclude my talking time so I'll just find an appropriate excuse, resson, or way out. Only now im stuck yet again wanting so badly to just rewind, start over, and execute the subject perfectly- with an outcome consisting ideally of my listener giving feedback, opinions, shares similar experiences, and then they start talking about something else i listen and then maybe it'll be my turn to talk again. I feel like I'll never accomplish this goal which has become an emotional and socially awkward task. Deep down it bothers me to my core. I really feel ""less-than"" because of this-not necessarily like a failure in society, rather moreso I feel like a lousy being and incapable of experiencing this human-only quality aka this frickin talking thing humans do and they make it look amazing. In convo , I know I ffffuckkk up. When replaying convos in my head, I always stress about being sure to find the right words and phrases that'll help get both my thoughts and the side tracks smoothly back together and nicely digressing to the original point of the story whilst making all my blabbering tie together. Very seldom in my adult life have i executed this task, all while maintaining the listeners attention, and correlating everything to a complete final thought, closing smoothly without awkwardness at the end of talking time while my point is understood, my thoughts actually relayed and executed, points are clear, side stories all came together , concluded well and it's done I HAVE TALKED (way more than necessary but I got the point across) YAY although it was tough to salvage and redirect the conversarion, i did it anyway and I walk away feeling great, good, amazing, accomplished, confident, and purely human. All because I suddenly did it and talked with another person and didn't confuse them, become an annoyance, or embarrass myself. I do think that my severe ADHD, genius IQ brain, emotional immaturity and the pressure of wanting so badly to communicate like everyone else all together wears down on me. I just hate that I can't recognize the second i begin steering all over. Sometimes i do recognize this a little late but early enough to go back to topic. Sometimes I get so absorbed in extra information I gradually begin losing track about what was initially being said so at this point either i try to rescue the conversation and get back on track or re-intrigue my listener by usually brainstorming something interesting that'll grasp their attention again and make them forget or not even notice that I just lost track of what I read saying. For example ill begin sharing a relevant medical fact, life hacks, health tricks, or share a crazy story from prison. Sometimes I just don't even care to continue with the effort of trying to talk anymore though so I'll just straight up apologize and tell the person something like ""idk how I went from talking about this to that and now we're here my bad later dude"" or oftentimes I can sense that they are very lost but pretend to be engaged because they don't wanna seem rude, I can usually sense when they're uninterested, or sometimes it's blatantly obvious that they're overwhelmed and just ready for me to shut up and stop talking, especially during those times my speech picks up pace resulting in me going on and on and on about absolutely nothing. So when I finally realize that im doing this im ashamed embarrassed , and yet again feel like a lousy human so i'll say ""sorry I have issues carrying on about things sometimes i know it's annoying im aggravating myself too, ttyl"" then the conversation is awkwardly over and im yet again left wondering and asking God wtf is wrong with me. 

On the phone, it's not as complex just frustrating because I grew up talking on the phone to my friend very often for hours at a time. I used to love it. All people wanna do these days is text but i hate typing on a phone or small device especially because I can just call someone to ask a quick question. Lack of Traditional telephone use in today's age frustrates me because technology has diminished phone calls which saddens me and I find myself getting not depressed or angry but yearning deeply for phone conversations to come back into the world. I even express this to my psych because i really miss communicating on the phone ever so effectively with no awkward body language, eye contact, hand shakes or hugs which are commonly associated with conversarion in society I've noticed, if I simply don't like the topic they're talking about while in person I feel obligated to hear them out and force a response when i really just wanted to walk away in the middle of them speaking, but on the phone I can easily tune them out while paying half attentiont till it's my turn to talk, or i can just the conversation short and say someone's beeping in I'll call you back, or so and so needs the phone gotta go, or just something random because getting off the phone without feeling like im being rude is soooooo easy. But when i talk on the phone today people tell me to text them. I usually don't. 

Now with text messaging- im the kind of person to either read your text and then reply hours to a week later. I'm aware I forget to reply to people and routinely re read my text and check for forgotten messages, reply either with a very short response, or send 5 texts on a row because I realized i needed to say more right after I hit send. Theres no in between. When i realized that i have forgotten to text people back, you'd think that after a few days or a week I'd say forget it theres no use in replying right? Wrong!, this is so not the case. For some reason, I MUST respond to this person. I cannot just forget about it because I already forgot about them once and it will eat by mind away for whatever reason so i just tell them sorry i just saw this and touch base in whatever they texted me about. Half the time they don't reply, mostly people delete their texts regularly so they ask to remind them what they last said, sometimes they're like no problem girl what's up. At this point conversation is premature and the pressure is on so I'll either put the phone down and decide to text them later while reassuring myself that it WILL be in A timely manner, and i promise myself to not forget. From here i either reply later or wayy later. I find in texting, sometimes conversation picks up BUT for whatever reason when I text, i send anywhere from 2-8 messages at a time (rarely ever one at a time) because when I send the first one - in hitting ""send""- I suddenly need to add something. That's 2 texts in a half minute so I skim over them and now that I have reread my text and replied twice, but gotta add this okay cool yes! It's sent. But wait fuck I need to add this so I'm hitting send again. Wait that reminds me of this... send again. Maybe that distracted them let me explain better in another text.. which strictly results in yet another message sent. When I do this sometimes I get ignored, receive simply an LOL (and nothing more- just the three letters) as a reply, but surprisingly a few people actually keep up and on a few occasions I've had 2 to 3 different subjects/ stories going at once which included plenty 4""sends"" for 1 complete thought texts coming and going and when this happens I actually feel like my texting confidence jumps. 

Now with essays, letters, articles, emails, professional or business correspondence, post-it notes I hide for my boyfriend to find, or anything that includes putting my thoughts into words on paper or typing (excluding texts and social media), I feel very confident in conveying my point of view, grasping my readers attention, encouraging the readers feedback, constructive criticism, general opinion, point of view, or sometimes I just aim for a reply. I efficiently brief on points that need to be explained more thoroughly without getting off track and developing new subjects. Its great. 

Why can i simply just NOT talk. Why does this happen to me. why am I unable to communicate in society as an adult. I must wanna enlighten people about what I've learned in life like talk 
about the human body, crazy shit that happened im prison, share fuckin stories, interests, laugh and just talk like i see people doing all the time. How does one function like that and why does it appear to be so easy. Im always wondering what the fuck is wrong with me. All I want is to have friendly conversations in all methods of communicating. Id love to one day have a smooth two way 30 minute conversarion with some stranger at Starbucks, carry on in bliss on the telephone floor 2+hours, or actually enjoy and carry on with a 10 minute or so texting conversarion that doesn't consist of multiple texts in a row back to back to complete my thought... this would be nice BUT DEEP DOWN I HATE TEXTING-AND EXTREMELY DESPISE EMOJIS. I flat out REFUSE to accept or attempt a video call. Im not mentally ready or prepared for that kind of pressure and i just don't know why.. maybe it's because i think I'll fail in that way too. When people video call me I panic then immediately text or message them and say I don't have internet or my cameras broken. I shouldn't even hit them up because maybe it's unecessary but I feel the urge that I must reply to these pupils who are trying to get in touch with me plus somehow I feel as if since they tried to get in touch with me, I now owe them my attention or time so i ultimately reach by trying to just call them because that's easiest for me...but no one ever answers the damn phone! Now even though i hate this method, I know I need to just get over it and get with the program and get used to it so I resort to using text which( as explained earlier) you already know gets me flustered. 

Y'all TALKING this is something I want so bad. I love everything about being human and the fact that we communicate with words is so intriguing to me. It's what makes us unique from animals being that they make noises, roars, calls etc. I want so so so badly to master this( I'll call it) conversation/communication barrier - which I've had my whole life. I forgot to mention, in conversation the other person always starts or goes first (I yearn to talk but have a fear of being rejected so I refrain from just starting a random convo) but when someone's talking to me- im all ears!! I absolutely love listening to people when it's their turn to talk, I'm eager to gain knowledge and wisdom, lessons, second hand experience, just embracing all the kinds of shit you get out of listening to people. I usually really just enjoy hearing them and also paying attention to how they organize their sentences, explanations, side stories, etc. And I just study how these people convey their point and express themselves about the subject at hand. Plus I'm flattered they want to express this to ME of all people. When they're talking everything it's great. However, I have an extremely hard time establishing when and if it's my time to begin, starting with what feedback, insight, advice, similar experiences, appropriate opinions, or just general information I got out of their story. This is where I ffffuckkk up.. i mostly get stuck when it's time to transition into what I wanna say, being confident that i actually have the floor and get excited that I have the opportunity (which maybe this time will be perfect and feel like a luxury) to express myself.

29,"Hi. Thanks for reading me.

I was diagnosed in 2016 with recurrent depression, my psychologist couldn’t pinpoint approximately at what age it started according to multiple talks during several sessions, so...it was diagnosed as recurrent.

I have been wondering if two events from my childhood could be assumed as they were depressive behaviors or signs. I was afraid to tell my doctor about them, and I’ve avoided telling that I have punched myself on my face, legs and scratched my face.

The really first memory of something weird that I have on my mind is that when I was like 3/4/5 years old and I was being scolded by my mom for something I don’t remember, she talked to me in a harsh tone and I started to cry, she didn’t pay attention and asked me to go to a room and bring her my dad’s shirt so she could iron it for him, so, I went to the room crying and took a belt put it around my neck and pulled from it hard, kept doing it whilst I walked back and handed my mom the shirt, I felt the pressure on my head and neck,  she saw me and asked “what are you doing?!” and I only remember saying crying that I did that because she didn’t love me. My mom took off the belt from my neck and then yelled at me and punched me with it. 
 
Could this be JUST and ONLY some kind of manipulative tantrum of a child, or it is definitely something more than just a tantrum, I mean...why I was trying to hurt myself in the process of a tantrum at that age? I don’t understand myself.


The second event happened around when I was 15 years old, I used to be very sad all the time because my parents were so extremely controlling, didn’t allow me to walk to school or from it to home even though it was a couple of blocks from home. I wasn’t allowed to go out with friends to the mall, or being outside with friends playing or just hanging out. I was scolded if I talked too much on the phone, or watch too much tv the only two things I could do to entertain myself besides reading books, I had great qualifications and was a “good kid”, but felt suffocated because I wanted to do such “bad things” (going out with friends, walking by myself to school, having chats with friends over the phone without my mother being near so she could listen). I was allowed to go to a female friend house, my parents knew her parents and also knew they didn’t allow us to go outside either. My classmates used to make fun of me because my mom until the very last day of high school picked me up and took me to school (it was just a couple of blocks away from home). Teachers used to talk about this things with my mother but she didn’t listen.

Anyways, I remember that around 15 years old, I already started having low self-team, negative thoughts, and one day that I was at my female friend house...it was time for me to leave so her parents offered to take me home with permission of my parents (couple of blocks away from my house but couldn’t go alone). I was complaining about how controlling they were, her parents just listened and kind of shook their heads implying like “that’s a little too much controlling”, like agreeing with me, we were waiting to cross a street and I just impulsively said loudly to a guy in a bicycle “hey please run over me! god!” the guy didn’t stop of course, my friend’s parents laughed, my friend laughed...I laughed.

So, this kind of “jokes” of “please I’m sick of this kill me/hurt me”, are something to worry about? I guess I didn’t really wanted to die but I wasn’t happy with my life either.


Please let me know your opinions.

Thanks again, have a nice day/night.",28Jun2019,1

Me and his GP still think it’s schizophrenia but he won’t admit to the psychiatrist what he’s hearing/seeing because he’s scared of how they treated him in hospital. He doesn’t understand it was his delusions and hallucinations that caused the problems. 

Anyways, my mental health is at an all time fuck up. I’ve had anxiety and depression before but now it’s gotten out of hand. My husband doesn’t understand his illness, and it’s so tiring trying to be there for him and to keep explaining things to him that he doesn’t seem to understand, running around to psych appts and doctors appts because he freaks out if I’m not with him.

44,"Here's my story: I was never the straight A's student in elementary and middle school (if anything, I was quite a reticent, mediocre kid all throughout elementary and middle school) but while in high school, I took a lot of interest in my academics, worked very hard, managed to get good grades, and even got accepted at a few prestigious universities; however, during one of my final exams, I completely blanked out and ended up with a low grade that ultimately cost me my college admission. For about six months, I felt like I had hit a complete dead-end. I felt like a complete failure, like I had no future, and the self-confidence that I had just started cultivating in high school took a deep plunge. I deactivated all my social media accounts because I was embarrassed and didn't have the courage to see my friends moving onto great schools. Incidentally, my family moved to the US around that time, and with very few options in front of me, I decided to enroll in community college. That turned out to be game-changer: I found a career path that I was passionate about, and I definitely began to rebuild some of my self-esteem. After more than one and a half-years,  I ran into some unforeseen (and absolutely unnecessary) visa complications for no fault of my own, and that put my career trajectory in jeopardy yet again. Again, I had to spend a good three months out of the country, all alone, drowning in tremendous stress, anxiety, and the crippling uncertainty of not knowing whether I would be able to return to my family and my school in the US. Fortunately, things came through, and I was back. I completed my AA degree, and transferred to a pretty good four-year university. 

It's been a year at university and I still find myself succumbing to frequent bouts of fear and anxiety. I tend to overthink everything, assume the most outlandish outcomes, and deliberately look for things to worry about. I feel scared, like I am not in control, like there is something I've overlooked. While this was never the case before HS, I tend to having fainting fits every time I get extremely anxious (been to the ER twice). It's ridiculous how something as simple as completing your undergrad seems like such a long, uphill task (and I say this because I've been out of HS for 5 years now and ALL of my friends have not only completed their bachelor's degree but also seem to have had the time of their lives doing it). I am on my summer break right now, and I find myself getting restless and anxious yet again. I am absolutely tired of this pit in my stomach, this feeling that something is going to go wrong and I would be left dangling yet again. Fortunately, my family has been extremely understanding and supportive, and proactively encouraged me to seek counseling at my university. While CBT has definitely helped me get better, I feel scared yet again now that I'm away for summer break (and I'm not preoccupied with classes, research etc.)

Even though I tell myself that I have come to terms with those past incidents, I am beginning to realize that that might not be the case. I really want to get through this last year of my undergrad and move on - hopefully to grad school for cognitive science (definitely ironic; it's just so ridiculously surreal to experience your brain literally spiral out of control while studying the neuronal circuitry that it causes to do so). I don't know what to ask here but I would appreciate if you could provide me some advice on how to deal with this crippling sense of anxiety and self-doubt. If nothing else, I have to admit, writing this whole thing down makes me feel a little better.",28Jun2019,1

50,"My partner and I live in London. We both have mental health issues. My partner had a mental breakdown in 2017 when he confronted his parents about his abuse and they haven’t spoken to him since. He has been trying to recover since then but it’s a slow process. Unfortunately, it’s too slow, and the world seems to be catching up to us. 

A bit more information: my partner is a freelance designer; due to the way his mental health problems manifest it means he struggles to find work, and when he does find it, he struggles to keep it for very long. I work, but I don’t earn enough to cover our extortionate rent and bills on my own - we both have to be working in order to cover everything we need to. We’ve explored my partner going on benefits, but as a freelancer he’s either not entitled to them or they don’t pay barely enough (around £50 a week). I have a small savings pot - around £1000 - but the rent alone is around 90% of that and it’s taken me a long time to save that money, I don’t really want to use it to pay one months rent if we can use that for something more important - like my partners health.

In terms of my partners health; I feel like we have exhausted all options. He has tried numerous types of therapy over the past decade and nothing seems to have worked for him. The only therapy he hasn’t tried is EMDR which we have tried to find for him, but therapists who are affordable are either fully booked or out of my price range. He has been on every available prescription which can be issued by a GP for anxiety, depression, PTSD, etc. He’s currently on Mitrazapine which helped with his sleeping and moods to begin with but seems to be working less and less now, and he also takes Propranalol which is a beta blocker firsts thing in the morning as he wakes up panicking. He has an appointment with a psychiatrist next week to talk about his medication - I’m hoping they come up with something helpful, but medication only gets you so far.

He sees a therapist through a charity organisation but this is a recent development as we couldn’t afford for him to keep seeing his old therapist. We requested EMDR but I’m not sure they can provide it. 

It seems if things stay this bad he will need to check himself in to the local hospital - if they’ll let him in - he’s not really a danger to himself or other people so not sure whether he’d even be admitted. I am worried that if he does check himself in however, then he will loose his autonomy and it would be uncertain when he would be able to leave. This is really scary for me. I don’t like the thought of him being stuck somewhere indefinitely, and I am also worried for myself - I won’t be able to afford the rent in his absence; we will loose our home and I will have no where to live. My savings won’t cover finding somewhere new to live in London and my family live outside of the city. If I was to go move back in with my parents, I would be leaving him in a mental hospital in London, unable to visit him regularly, with no home to come back to should he ever get out. 

An add in to say that neither of us have any financial aid from our families. We are financially independent and the only savings I have is the £1k I mentioned above. 

We’re both spiritual people, and I have mentioned maybe we look at his mental health through a different lens. It seems we have exhausted the medical science and psychology which is available to us - perhaps let’s try a more spiritual way of healing - but he seems to shut this suggestion down when I mention it.

The things is is that I’m exhausted; the longer this goes on the more my own mental health deteriorates and I’m loosing patience. We can’t go 3 days at a time (at best) before he looses it, and it’s so hard trying to help him out of despair and having every attempt at helping someone you love condemned as useless.

I just want him to be well and healthy, but I don’t know how to help any more than the things we’ve already tried. And I can’t help but be reminded that the clocks ticking and we need to come up with something fast, otherwise we’re going to be homeless.

Does anyone have any suggestions? I would be so grateful, you can’t even imagine.

TLDR: my partner had a mental breakdown 2 years ago, can’t seem to recover. We have tried everything but he’s still struggling, he can’t find work and we can’t afford to live. We need a quick solution which will enable him to recover before we get kicked out of our flat. Help!?",28Jun2019,1
51,I’m a really emotional person. I become sad and angry very easily and I cry at the slightest things. All of this has been going on for a while but it has been very bad this last month. It’s affecting all of my relationships. Is there a way I can desensitize myself? I don’t want to stop feeling emotions but I need to somehow dull the really intense ones.,28Jun2019,1
52," 

Quick summary, I believe my mother suffered from it.

1. She always say she hears that our neighbours want to hurt her or us.
2. She believe our house is bugged.
3. She want to report to police about this situation, when we stop her she gets angry at us.
4. She is never wrong, she blame everyone else for what's wrong.
5. She threaten that if we don't take action to help her with the neighbour she's gonna commit suicide or just throw her to the crazy hospital (her words not mine)

And yes we did brought her to a psychologist. He never told us what the heck is wrong with her even after 5 times (around 2 months) of visits.

He usually just prescribe Olanzapine and ask my mother to take it long term.

When I asked how can we as family help her, he said that there's no use explaining to her because this is a sickness, you just gotta use med to help her.",28Jun2019,1

54,"Through my reading last night, here are a few of the things that make me think I might be BPD rather than bipolar (trying to be as honest as possible in this post, I'm anonymous on the internet right now after all):

* I honestly don't think I've ever actually been manic (or ""hypomanic""), and I have mood swings constantly, like several times a day. I can go from really happy, to incredibly angry, to super depressed, to really happy again all within the same day. Bipolar people seem to have more prolonged mood shifts that last several weeks/months, whereas I'm just unstable and mood swinging all the time, and little things happening can affect my mood tremendously. Something minor can make me incredibly depressed and whiney for hours, then something else insignificant can happen to make me really happy and positive for a while.

* I don't think I've ever actually been properly psychotic, only pretended to be psychotic/been self-aware in those situations to scare people/get their attention/play the victim and act innocent and out of control. At times where I have started to slip from reality a little/think and feel some strange things, it's never longer than a few hours and I feel completely normal again after, able to recognize what the distorted thinking was. Also I don't have to be in a particular mood to get like this.

* I also think I haven't ever been seriously depersonalized, but I do feel like I'm in a dream and quite spaced out/floaty most of the time, things don't feel 100% real.

* I'm irritable and angry pretty much 24/7, and it's very easy to push me into a rage... this feeling doesn't go away. I feel like I'm a pin drop away from flipping out and losing my shit all the time. I've also self-harmed several times during rages, seriously worrying others.

* I'm impulsive all the time - it's not like with bipolar where they seem to only be more impulsive during manic episodes. Even when I'm super depressed/low I can be really reckless and impulsive, not thinking things through and just acting out and making poor decisions. It's like a part of me doesn't care and almost relishes the self-destruction, confusing others, etc.

* I have a *lot* of interpersonal issues and problems maintaining relationships with other people. I'm honestly very emotionally manipulative of people and (as I said in the OP) a compulsive liar; I have no real sense of self/don't know what I'm actually like, so constantly play a character and trick others into believing it. 

* More on relationships: I'll cry and act out so people sympathize with me/don't leave. I know this sounds terrible but I basically manipulated my first girlfriend into staying with me for a good while after things started to go south, by acting self-destructive and threatening self-harm/suicide etc. until she saw through my bullshit. I also have so much drama and stir so much shit in my relationships, and tend to make the other person upset a lot, and - I know this sounds terrible - a part of me likes it, it's like an addiction. Also in relationships I don't know if I actually love the person or if I'm just using them as a crutch not to be alone, and a shoulder to cry on.

* I'm incredibly defeatist and very self-loathing, isolating myself a lot/shutting people off at times, but again a lot of this feels attention-seeking when I go on like ""oh I'll never succeed at this, I'm such a loser, I should just kill myself lol"" etc. I do sometimes have grandiose/confident feelings but it feels more like a front/coping mechanism/pretending towards others than anything, and it's very volatile.

* I don't take responsibility or blame for anything, and while one part of me feels guilty/ashamed, another part is able to sort of repress and distract myself from the guilt, and convince myself I'm not in the wrong. It's almost like I make myself emotionally cold and numb to protect myself. I always find myself playing the victim and acting innocent, and often I can manipulate people, shift the blame on someone else and get away with it.

* I've self-harmed in one way or another all through my life, but again a lot of it was more for attention and sympathy while no real permanent damage was done.

* I've always had a very neurotic personality, and apparently BPD people tend to score higher on neuroticism. I've struggled with depression and anxiety recurrently pretty much all my life, but there's something more to it than that, more intrinsic to my personality/just how I am beyond my mood, which I think might be BPD or whatever. Like, I know I'm an unstable crazy manipulative lying toxic clingy person, but I feel like I can't help it. I'm also very self-centered and while I act selfless I tend to put myself and needs before anyone else, it's almost like a reflex to protect myself.

* My thinking is very black and white, and'll go from one extreme to the other at the drop of the hat, there's no in-between. I can go from absolutely loving to absolutely hating something for petty reasons. I tend to view things and talk in extremes, which causes people to think I'm being ""over the top"" and ""melodramatic"" etc.

* For a silly cartoon analogy :P I relate a lot to Ren from the Ren &amp; Stimpy show (but seriously it's honestly uncanny)

It'd be interesting to hear people's thoughts. I'm a 20yo guy and apparently this disorder's more common in, or at least more commonly diagnosed in, women, though I've always been very feminine and, while I don't want to generalise, feel like I understand the female mind more than the male mind - I don't know if that has anything to do with it. Also most people I message online/communicate with via text automatically assume I'm a woman for some reason based on how I talk and act.",28Jun2019,1
55,"I haven’t had any physical contact with “friends” since April. The closest thing I’ve gotten to it was talking to doctors while I was inpatient. 

Recently I’ve started talking to my ex again who I was with two years ago, haven’t dated anyone since. I don’t love her, I’m not even interested in women, but when she tries to flirt I just go auto pilot and flirt back. We agreed to meet up in person in a few days, I didn’t want to see her again but something is refusing to let me say no. 

I’m afraid with the pace things are going. Again, she’s flirting with me and has been saying quite uncomfortably suggestive things. I’m afraid she’s going to want to get in a relationship again. She’s hyper sexual and I’m borderline asexual, hell thats the reason I broke up with her! I can’t fucking stand sex but she was consistently trying to get at it with me. And if she tries something with me again I don’t think I’ll even be able to say no because the desperate affection drained part of me has pretty much taken over. 

I really hope that’s just the way she talks and she isn’t really flirting. It’s possible I’ve forgotten. Reasonable men do unreasonable things for love.

57,"So as in the title, my GP referred me to a local ""Community Mental Health Recovery Service"" and I had an assessment yesterday morning (they said up to 1.5hrs but it was only like 45 mins lol). 

After the assessment they asked me to fill in some forms which was going alright - I was actually in a good mood and in the flow, there was good music playing, I was vibing - but there was this one form that just wasn't clear or making sense to me, it just baffled me. I flipped out and without thinking ripped the thing up and threw it in the bin (fucking stupid I know). 

I went to the reception with the rest of the forms and asked if it was alright/if I needed to fill in another one but they said it was fine yadda yadda... but I'm still paranoid I should've filled in that damn form, and that might be why they haven't gotten back to me yet (they said they'd discuss my case with other people in the mental health team right after my assessment, and get back to me hopefully that afternoon, but I still haven't heard anything). 

What should I do? Should I call them up and ask if I really don't need to fill in that form (I can cycle there again, I have counselling this afternoon at the YMCA which is near the hospital)? I don't want the whole of yesterday morning to have gone to waste just because I didn't fill in one bloody form, I don't have time for that shit!",28Jun2019,1

59,"So this is just a rant. Although I do think therapy is worthwhile, it's not always straightforward for everyone. However, I'm just so pissed off right now. My mum had a rough childhood. Her mum was very sick ever since she was young which led to my mum having a complicated relationship with illness to say the least. 

I've had chronic health problems for several years now and there's so much shit that I've directly been affected by due to my mother's lack of dealing with her problems. Not only do I not get any emotional support for being young and in extreme pain everyday, it's actually damaged my health as well. 

I've been ill for about 4 years now and only recently found out that I have hypothyroidism and am hypermobile, which contributes to my pain. If my mum had just dealt with her shit, I would've been diagnosed so much earlier and not had to deal with everything that happened. 

It wasn't until my amazing doctor was like ""hey we should test you for this, do you have any family history"". I said no as I didn't know but guess who fucking tells me that thyroid problems run in the family AFTER I get a positive result? I'm more mad about the hypothyroidism than the hypermobility as that is treatable and I suffered for 4 years needlessly.

60,"Hey there! 

I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety since i was a child and about two and a half years ago I began meeting with a therapist to assist me in working through my mental health. 

My mother, whose insurance i’m under is pretty good (Blue Cross), but once i turn 26 i’ll be transferring over to my work’s provider, Aetna. 

Unfortunately, my therapist doesn’t accept Aetna. I’ve informed her of this change but don’t at all expect her to go out of her way to accommodate my new insurance. What are my options? I’ve done some googling but couldn’t quite find any insight — any chance that i’m grandfathered in or something? 

I could start seeing a new therapist but I’ve done years of work with her, and she really knows me; which makes it all the much easier to share with her what’s going on with me bi-weekly. 

Does anyone have similar experience with this?

May 17- woke up forgot who I was(5am) had a very weird hallucination with my eyes closed, I know I was not dreaming. I closed my eyes immediately and saw this surreal image of Lara who made laarbar asking me when the last time I had a laarbar was. regained consciousness by about 10. Mental breakdown at 12 thought I was dying/needed to kill myself. Went outside, listened to clock noises and freaked out because nothing felt real. Saw boyfriend after going through Starbucks drive through reading dbt book. Came home and watched 2 movies. At 6 I had another episode triggered by ants outside my window on leaves. Thought I was going permanently crazy, parents took me to mental hospital where I calmed down by 9 and got to leave. Started taking Wellbutrin after this


June 16- I think I took 2x the dose of my Wellbutrin (300mg xl) started to be very very confused and talking to people was very difficult. I left my boyfriends and tried to drive home but had to park. I looked in the rear view mirror and saw a shadow man with a knife. Then I drove off really quickly and parked again in my neighborhood and saw a shadow hand coming for my neck. When I got home 2 hours later I thought if I slept I would die and if I closed my eyes and laid down I would astral project (lol) 

Was fine the next morning. 

Then went on a trip to the beach and things started to look fuzzy sometimes, like they would move around and breath. I was really paranoid I would die on this trip. I found someone’s fabric cutting scissors in the bathroom and hid them in my backpack so no one would kill my friend and I. 

Now I get the fuzzy ceiling sometimes. When this happens I just put myself to sleep lol.",28Jun2019,1
64,"So I feel very invalidated. It took me a second to realize how I’m feeling but that’s it. I know how I feel, this has been my whole life, and to hear that I’m “spending too much time on the internet” or “maybe it’s your new meds, you were doing so well before” When I know how I feel, just makes me feel like I’m over dramatic and maybe none of this is real. I want a psych evaluation but apparently it’s just going to make me “focus on the label” why is it so wrong to want to know what’s going on? 

It just made me feel so hopeless. Like maybe... maybe this is just life. Like nothing is going on mentally with me but this is just life and I can’t handle it. And if that’s the case, what’s the point to any of this? I just feel with a proper diagnosis I can more help and understand what’s happening “Well you’re on medication maybe they won’t get an accurate diagnosis blah blah.” Alright.

65,"Hi reddit, so I've been recovered from my crisis for about 8 months now. Things are really good in no small part from getting into the great sport of rock climbing. Where I live there are almost no rocks so I drive to a gym roughly an hour from me. It's a great hit of escapism and I really feel I've moved on from the hell which I went through. I've made a new group of friends from that area. 

The gym I go to is opening a new branch soon, 10 mins from my house. This is great, right? Well when I heard the news I felt a sickening knot in my stomach. Panic that my ""pure"" sport of choice will be corrupted by people and places from my past terrifies me to the point of making me want to quit. Feelings of inadequacy have returned with a vengeance. It's making forgetting my crisis and moving on really hard. It's making me feel bad about myself again and the idea of people connected to my past doing my sport makes me feel like a failure.

A bit more info, I'm 17 my crisis happened while I was at school although my mental health had been shit for a few years before then to. School and a lot of people connected to it are a trigger and like I said before, end up corrupting anything near me. I was never bullied and most of the people I left on good terms with and even after hearing about the new centre are wanting to climb with me, though I've tried to end these friendships as they (inadvertently) cause anguish I'm sure you can understand its tricky. I finished with my CPN, crisis intervention team, and therapist months ago those who I would normally talk this out with. I also don't really want to get back in touch with them if I don't have to due to not wanting to put family/make them worried anything will happen again.

I'm at a loss at what to do, I've briefly spoken about it with friends and family who know what happend but they don't know what to say. The only thing I want is to just move miles away from where I live and start a fresh but it's just not possible at the moment.

Any help would be so appreciated, thank you all.",28Jun2019,1
66," I'm rereposting this post because I want to share my experience with  depression and help you understand how I managed a couple of months ago  to get through it. I've been depressed since I was 15, lasting about 6  years until I finally came to understand what it is. I had no will to  live, contemplated suicide and had no purpose in life or whatsoever and  the truth is you don't need really need one. Basically to explain I need  you to understand what thinking and feeling is. Feeling something is  reacting to external action through thoughts that make us feel and  react. The way we do that is natural but if you control your reaction  then you control what you think and then you control what you feel. What  you feel is your choice. It is and will always be and if you say you  can't then that's that's your ego not allowing you to do so (important  to note that I don't talk about physical feel) . It's really hard, I  know, I'm already talking about things that are hard to visualize but  please allow yourself to understand that everything you feel can be  controlled through thinking. If you choose to be sad you will be sad, if  you choose to be happy you will be happy, your mental state is a  choice, What. You. Believe. In. Is. A. Choice. ( important to note that  not everything we believe is also true) I believed I was depressed,  because of it I allowed it to eat me from within for years basically  disabling myself from feeling other emotions but I believe it was a good  thing for myself because it built me. Believing things can be  dangerous, it directly affects your body and brain and modifies you,  this is how worse it can get. It can get so bad that no matter how much  help you get from outside it will be useless so the deeper you get the  harder to get out. I don't advise you to take small steps doing small  things or anything like that. I advise you to choose to stop believing  you are depressed  because it will keep being real if you keep believing  in it. The mind is the most powerful thing because we have a  consciousness and the worst thing about it is the ego. We will  ultimately die and return to the ground and your consciousness will  cease to exist and so you will live this short life the way you choose  to. So i'm asking you, WHAT DO YOU  CHOOSE?",28Jun2019,1

70,"Two days ago I was in crisis and called a local distress line. This is not the first time I have done so, nor is it the first time I've sought medical care for mental health issues. They asked me if I was suicidal. I was not, but I told them I have been in the past since they wanted a complete medical history. After hanging up I lay down on the couch and tried to sleep. Within an hour two police officers showed up at my door. They were hostile and treated me like I had committed a crime. I told them I did not want to go to the hospital (I have not had great emergency room experiences in the past) so they handcuffed me with my hands behind my back and put me in the back of their car. The police officer made every attempt to slam on the breaks so my head would hit the screen. I was marched through the hospital with handcuffs on and put in a small room with the officers who sat and glared at me until there was a locked room available. Two other officers then took over for them and candidly told me I was wasting their time. The emergency room staff were as unkind as they could have been. One nurse came in and put a piece of paper on the table which was a notice that I was being held under the Mental Health Act. I asked her what it meant. She said, ""I don't have time to explain this to you, all I am required to do is hand you this document."" I asked how long it would be before I could see a doctor and her response was: ""I don't know, could be one hour or ten."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Two people were seated outside my room. Their job was to sit and watch me I suppose, although they spent most of their time texting on their mobile phones. I attempted to put the bed down from a reclining position so that I could sleep but couldn't figure out the mechanism. They laughed.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually a nurse came to take some blood work.  She was the only person who treated me like a human being and even  though she was not a psych nurse she sat and talked with me for 10 minutes. She managed to convince the security staff that there was no need to lock the door after her and that I was safe enough to go to the bathroom without supervision.

&amp;#x200B;

I finally did speak with a psych resident who was empathetic. She was able to find some support services for me, but the earliest date I could get an appointment was ten days later.

&amp;#x200B;

I felt helpless and treated like a criminal at a time when I most needed some help. I realize emergency rooms are overwhelmed as are police forces, but until the bloodwork nurse came in I was dehumanized and treated like a burden on the system even though I had tried to convince the police that I didn't need to be hospitalized. This experience has left me with an intense mistrust of the mental health system and I am fearful of police, which I never was before.",28Jun2019,4

I’m 37M, married to HS sweetheart, 2 amazing little kids. I’m an RN and have a cake job by nursing standards. I have seniority and have great coworkers but I can barely pull myself out of bed to get to work and that’s the easy part. It’s like pulling teeth trying to get me to get anything done at work. I sit there, exhausted and zoning out and then work in spurts to make sure I do what I need to.

I think about suicide constantly but have only felt legitimately scared for my safety once, a year or so ago. I’ve lost a couple of very close friends recently, one to suicide, and I think of them daily. That’s the only real tangible thing I can point to that saddens me.

I’ve struggled with what I would call depression and anxiety for about 20 years. On and off meds at times – diagnosed at different time depresson/anxiety (Zoloft (still on low dose), Lexapro (worked ok), Wellbutrin (gave me more anxiety)), rule out bipolar (lamictal (made my hair thin), trileptal (just stopped taking, saw no change), and low dose abilify (made me hypomanic for a couple weeks until I stopped taking), and ADD (Adderall XR – actually helped my mood/energy quite a bit but it would make me feel a little out of it).

My symptoms:

- mainly inability to sit still or concentrate most of the time unless it’s something I find particularly interesting (this started in junior high and continued through multiple degrees – I would just cram for tests/assignments and always did well), tired CONSTANTLY, and recently feeling extreme anhedonia at times. I’m extremely nostalgic and all of my memories (even happy ones) just make me sad at this point. It’s very difficult for me to listen to a lot of music as it all reminds me of the past and I get sad.

- I’m extremely vigilant and it causes me to always be somewhat agitated – it’s hard for me to ever totally relax and enjoy myself without substances.

- When at work I always feel out of it/like I’m walking through a dream kind of thin

- I’ve always been weird about senses (the way my clothes fit, touching certain textures/substances, etc.) and (for multiple reasons) my wife believes I may be somewhere on the autism spectrum.

- Substance abuse – long family history of alcoholism and I struggled myself before, more in control now. I have also struggled with low dose opiate (hydrocodone and tramadol) use – opiates make me extremely euphoric

Good things I’ve done: quit smoking completely a year ago, though I was a very light smoker. My eating habits over the past few months have been great compared to how they were the last few years (mostly binging sugary foods).

I’m kind of giving up after a handful of meds and diagnoses over the years. I guess I’m writing hoping that someone will have insight into what may be my proper diagnosis so I can really try to address it. I’m not suicidal, but I feel like I need a long break from life which obviously isn’t possible.

 I am severely obsessed about what others think of me. When I talk to someone,  I do not listen to what they are saying, I focus on their micro-expressions, what to say, and where to look, so they do not think I am an idiot. It is really hard to listen to what they are actually saying. I grasp couple of words and try to make sense out of it. Also, I try my best to look the best possible everyday (spend 2 hours getting ready) and I completely avoid doing mistakes infront of others. If I do something wrong, I beat up myself for months because of it.

I thought it is maybe social anxiety, but I am not anxious when I talk to people. I get anxious on some occassions when I am not mentally prepared to talk to others. However, when there is a group presentation, I get severly anxious. That is because I have to focus on everyone in the room, not just one person, and make everyone think I am good enough. Of course I end up fucking up the presentation due to the intense pressure, and beat up myself for months.

I do not know what is wrong with me. I always tell myself I don't have to think about what others think about me, but I can't control it; it is literally hard-wired in my brain and it seems like I can't change it. People think I am awkard and aloof. No one enjoys my company.

This problem I am suffering from is incredibly exhausting, I need a solution. Whatever it is, I will do it (rejection therapy didnt work). Do you think it is social anxiety or I am just insane? Does anyone have any suggestions? It gets wrose as the years pass. Therapy isn't an option.",28Jun2019,1

79,"Hello - I am a 19 year old living in Sweden, diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome and ADHD.

I am just about completely indifferent to most anything - but that might be a bit hard to put into perspective. After a fairly rough and tumultuous childhood - which I'm sure I could write pages about, but will summarise as such - I got to a point where at 12 years old I locked myself away inside of my room for a total of three years. During this time I did basically the very bare minimum to survive. I would lay in bed continuously and stare at the ceiling with the bare exception of visiting the bathroom. I would eat extremely rarely, usually only when forced upon me. I had no desires, no interests, no dreams, no hobbies, no passions, and barely any emotions to speak of at all.

Eventually, at the age of 15 I made up my mind - there was nothing specific I wanted in life, but I wanted to WANT something, no matter what that'd be. And I figured that if I stayed inside my room I would never get the chance to find anything. So with the very vague purpose of ""keeping my options open"", I moved out to a flat of my own, caught up to four years of missed schooling in one term at a local high school (I'd missed a year even before becoming a recluse, but had always been exceptionally good in school), and eventually started high school proper on time with my age group. During this period of time I had to learn just about everything from scratch, how to talk with people, how to move properly, how to make facial expressions, how to not take everything literally, how to cook for myself, how to keep my flat clean, and so forth.

However, I was still indifferent and essentially a robot, with no goals or ambitions - just a very small hope that maybe, some day, I'll find something. And, well, as I'm sure you could guess, that could only keep me going for so long. After finishing the first two years of high school without a hitch, getting top grades in just about everything (though my P.E grades were as abysmal as one would expect after three straight years of inactivity), I eventually crashed. I stopped coming to school, I stopped doing anything, and I reverted back into a similar state that I'd been in previously, mind you with a much better environment this time.

And now, after a year of absence, I believe I will be able to push myself through my final year of school - I have excellent teachers who have worked everything out with me, and a somewhat acceptable financial plan to stand on. (the Swedish state offers some ridiculous benefits to those with mental disorders)

However.

I still have absolutely nothing that drives me.

There is absolutely nothing in my life I care for. No hobbies, no interests, no relations, no dreams, no ambitions, no goals, no passions, no nothing. The only thing I have is the tiny hope that maybe, one day, I'll find something, anything - and the fact that if I stay locked up in my apartment, or take my life for that matter, I won't even have that chance.

But I know that I can't keep running on that, sure, maybe for another year, I'll probably finish high school, no problem. But after that there's nothing.

I must have talked to over a dozen psychiatrists over the years, I've talked to teachers, I've talked to my family, and I've talked to the few friends I've had. And absolutely no one has offered me anything that has helped me in any way shape or form. The local psychiatrists have given up - I don't even meet them anymore, they have told me that they can't help. I've tried various types of medication, I'm currently on Sertraline, but so far nothing has helped in that regard either - they've had absolutely no effects.

I'm not really suffering in any sense, I'm not sad, I'm not down in any way, but I'm also not happy - I am completely indifferent. I am not depressed, we've come to that conclusion, and I am perfectly physically healthy as well.

I'm just spending my days hazily drifting about, laying in bed, going for walks, doing the very basics of housework and other practical work. Sometimes I'll have seemingly random moments of hyperfocus, as is typical of ADHD, but even that is just mechanical, there is no actual emotion or interest behind it. 

I have always been able to do anything I've tried, at least given a little time to learn, I've never really failed at anything, but I've also never really had any goals to fail at. I don't have issues in school, I don't have any real practical issues, it's all mental. From the outside very few people are aware of my turmoil, I am a perfect honour student - or at least I was until I vanished for a year. It took me a long time and a lot of practice, but I'm, perfectly socially capable - however I feel no interest towards people or relations, and I always end up very tired after interacting with them.


I don't know where to go, what to do, or how to solve anything. Because for most intents and purposes, I don't even have any problems to solve.


My current plan is to head off abroad for university in a year, and see if a different environment could change anything, but even that is just a crap shot.


Anything, be it advice, comments, similar experiences, suggestions, random ideas, whatever, is very, very appreciated - I'm really at my wit's end on my own.

But he's always trying to solve my problems for me... saying if I spend more time with friends, if I do this or that, I'll be better. I try to explain to him  that this might work for him, but that my situation is different. I even brought him into meet my therapist once and she and I both discussed this with him. He agreed with what we were saying, but no matter how much I tell him he still tries to fix my problems as if my depression is just something I can flip off with a run or some meditation. While I do these things frequently and while they *do* help me, my issues are so much deeper and have been going on my whole entire life. When I try to tell him this he just says I'm being pessimistic. *No* I know I'm not being pessimistic. I know one day I'll have it all under control, but it's not as simple as he thinks it is.

83,"Question: Has anyone taken Remeron (I’ve been on for a long time now) and Zoloft together? I just got prescribed Zoloft but a friend had a bad experience with it. It was either that or Prozac and I was leaning towards Prozac but my psychiatrist didn’t really give me an option even though she introduced both medications as possibilities ? 
Rant: Yesterday my psychiatrist sent me into a panic attack because she was being very forceful about exposure therapy being the only option for me. She put down the progress I’ve made on my own (which has been leaps and bounds), was insistent and ignoring my comfort zone, and basically threatened to not work with me anymore if I’m not in therapy. She was upset with me for recently cutting off the relationship with my last therapist (2 1/2 months), and I tried to explain how hard it is to find a therapist and I’ve made 50+ phone calls so it’s not like I’m not putting in the work. She also was going on about the drug abuse history in her family and said she might be projecting. Shes usually eccentric and a bit too personal but yesterday she was on the defense and aggressive in her mannerisms. When I did have the panic attack, she tried to hug me and when I jolted away and said that I don’t like to be touched, she said “oh that’s right, the social anxiety” and then was saying things like “I’m so sorry baby” “I didn’t want it to go like this baby”. Afterward, she equated our meeting as “bickering”; like we were pals having a disagreement. I’m leaving a lot of details out but that’s the gist of what happened.",28Jun2019,1

86,"Hi... I'll start off with admitting I don't trust doctors. It took them 20 years to diagnose me with Celiac Disease. I trust them even less to find out what's going on in my head.

Lately things are getting even worse. I don't feel like I'm connected to reality. I have no concept of time; it doesn't feel like hours, days, months, or even years pass. It's so hard to sleep because I don't feel like I've been awake for that long but then I want to crash at times I'm not able to sleep. Memories of what happen during the day don't really register.

I have what I want to say are intrusive thoughts. The voices just won't be quiet. I think of horrible things and they make me paranoid. I've ruined yet another friendship because I accused them all of being out to get me and wanting to hurt me. I genuinely believe they were but I've been told I'm wrong.

I can't focus on anything for long. Even if it's fun like video games or a movie I need to do/check sometime else; it doesn't get my undivided attention.

What can I even do for this? Are there meds? I feel like I can't live like this anymore.",28Jun2019,1

I am fresh out of college now and Today I got a job interview 36 miles from my house and I know its normal to feel anxiety during a job interview but I started to feel panic come on during my drive there and it got worse until I was in the parking lot and I had a full blown panic attack and it felt like I was going to die so I drove off and didnt go into the interview. Last month, I had an interview scheduled for an entry level position but the manager was like my age and I felt guilt and shame and hate for myself because I could have done more with my life so I just didnt show up for that interview and now they wont hire me for any other position.  Also I sometimes have thoughts about what it would look like if I hurt other people, I want to clarify that I do not ever want to hurt anyone and would never do that but its like my mind thinks of different things that I would never do and I think about what if I did them and it causes me great distress and panic.

90,"I am concerned about my mom but am not sure what is going on. She seems to think things are happening/happened that aren't. She seems to habitually see herself as a victim in a variety of situations. I am unsure if she is having age related memory loss, is just lying, or for some other reason tends to think things are happening that aren't. My grandma said she took her to a mental health professional with one of her specialties being Alzheimer's. That person didn't think that was what was going on. My grandma isn't the moat reliable narrator and I don't know if that person was qualified to diagnose. I also don't know how to respond when she is talking about things happening that haven't or even if I don't know whether it happened or not. I live in the United States if that helps. 

Some examples of things that she thinks happened that didn't:
-Thinks I asked her to be my Matron of Honor (We ended up having a court house wedding without family due to safety concerns relating to her.)
-Claimed my now husband was making religious statements completely opposite of what he said. Me and my friend agreed that is not what he said.
-Accused my grandma of saying mean things she didn't say. My husband and I were there for that. 
-She has repeatedly made false claims about me. 
-Accusing friends of mine of making fun of her. I was there.

Questionable things she has said:
-Accusing multiple exes of crime against her.
- Thinks people have been damaging and breaking into her car
-Said multiple current or previous employers have conspired against her.
-Has thought a very large amount of men were interested in her.
-Thinking other women are upset because their husbands are interested in her.
-Thinking people dislike her or are mistreating her because she is White. 

Other concerns:
- Seems to have a lot of conflict with people, mainly women
-Getting upset and running away
- Getting upset and supposedly losing her voice 
-Has said she was going to kill herself(not recently)
-possibly a hoarder

I feel bad saying all this. I love my mom and really don't like having conflict with her. It seems like I can't help her frequently being upset with me. I have good memories of her doing nice things for me and she talks about helping others a lot. I am not trying to make her look bad.",28Jun2019,1
91,"I've had mental health problems for years, so badly that I have failed 2 grades due to completely breaking down and shutting in for days at a time, 5 hospitalizations, and much more.

I beat myself up over everything, it's not very noticeable due to a naturally calm demeanor. I have been threatened to be assaulted over my issues, alongside being fired from my job during a hospitalization with no reason given, despite trying to return to work the day I was released. At this point I have lost most if not all drive and passion, but I don't blame the world around me, as despite my feelings about myself, I truly believe the world is beautiful, and deep in my heart, that there has to be some purpose for my being out there, that goes beyond being alive as to not hurt other people with your passing. With all of that said, for the past year my mental health has been declining faster than ever, despite therapy and medication, to the point where I started seeing and hearing things that were not there regularly. I honestly hope for the best in the future, as I genuinely don't know if I could take it if it continues worsening, as much smaller things have easily torn me down before.",28Jun2019,4

96,"Disclaimer: I don’t want anyone to be able to identify my sister from this post so I’ve intentionally left some minor details out and kept some things vague.

Hi all, so my sister is 22 and has been dealing with a pretty severe case of depression for the past several years. It’s caused her to attempt suicide in the past and recently-ish she was kicked out of her university because she failed a class (she had no motivation to do the work). 

I feel for her and love her, and I really want to help but it’s a struggle. I have encouraged to her start working with a Counselor and luckily the Counselor seems to actually care and provides my sister with a lot of good support. With that said, I don’t think that it’s enough. My sister’s condition is pretty severe, one result of that is that she’s unable to work a regular job because her depression causes her to blow relatively small issues out of proportion which ultimately leads her to think poorly of herself and her capabilities.

Her personal life does not fulfill  her which I think is understandable. She does not have a lot of friends and she has a tendency to get extremely emotionally invested in some of the friendships she does have. Within the last year she reunited with a high school friend who she felt really close to who had undergone a physical transformation, which affected my sister very deeply. For at least a couple of weeks she told me and close friends that she felt hurt because she felt like they shared a very special bond and now it feels like they are strangers. She later disclosed to me that the incident was the cherry on top of her depression and  for a little bit of time it caused her to start seriously considering suicide again. 

I’m still a student and my parents are working class with considerable financial struggles of their own, but still they are investing a lot of money into making sure that she is happy and will improve. I don’t know what to do because myself and my family are doing our best to support her and I am scared that it’s not enough. She’s currently on vacation while taking a couple of bridging courses, and I call her most days to find out how she’s doing and how she’s feeling. That said, I have an impending feeling of doom regarding her situation. I am scared that something will happen with a friend or in some other area of her life that will cause her to spiral and seriously contemplate suicide again. She had an unsuccessful attempt once that landed her in the hospital and I want to do everything in my power to make sure she doesn’t try again. She’s going to be coming back home soon and I am pretty sure she will just be at home again 24/7 which is obviously not conducive to good mental health. I’m going to be leaving the country for at least a year so I will not be able to take her out or keep tabs on her behaviour. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you very much in advance (:",28Jun2019,1

I post this only as a service to others. I live in Spokane, Washington, US.

I recently was seen by a psychiatrist to deal wth depression. He prescribed an SSRI that has a black box warning. 

I, unfortunately, had a very bad reaction to the drug.

I called, reached out for help from the symptoms, which were severe enough to require some kind of intervention. 

He never called me back. His office never called me back. The next day I contacted them, and thier answer was ""the dr. never talks to patients, he passes on his thoughts to us, and we call."" That would be fine if they took substantial intake notes, but I only talked to a receptionist.

This lack of involvement could have caused my situation to become dire. A physician dealing with  mentally ill patients should have the decency to to be involved, especially when prescribing potentially life-threatening drugs. If it's not malpractice, it certainly is douchbaggery at a high level.

My finals started about 2 months ago, and even though i was stressed and could never really relax, i felt so much better than i do now. I'ts almost like I feel empty, now that my summer vacation started.

Next year i'm taking an extra year in 'ground school' (a normal thing to do in Denmark) before i continue with my education. I'm taking this year at the same school I attend now. I chose to continue at my school, instead of finding a new one, because of the teachers (some of the most amazing, influential and kind people i've ever met), and because of the Sports and Adventure program. I'll be taking my diver's license (not driver's license, just to be clear), and going on a lot of trips and adventures doing the year. This is all great, but i have two worries; The first is the fact that most of my current friends and classmates, will be continuing their education, and although i will be seeing them again, i won't be able to be classmates with them.  
The second concern is my classmates for next year. I met them once, at some sort of meeting, and i just feel like they are completely different from me.

I had been looking forward to the party, and i had a good time. But this morning when i texted her, it seemed like she wasn't actually that into me. I get feelings for girls pretty quickly, and I'm worried that i have feelings for her, but she doesn't have those same feeling for me.

Lately I've been worrying so much that I've started to think about suicide. I can't stop thinking ""she'll commit suicide one day and I'll never hear from her again"". I feel so trapped, like there's no good way out of the situation. I can't just abandon her, can I? But if it keeps going like this my mental health will be ruined. She knows that I'm worried but I haven't told her how dramatically it's affecting my wellbeing, she already thinks she's a burden and thinks everyone would be better off without her and I don't want to give her even more reasons to feel bad. 

&amp;#x200B;

My heart doesn't want to leave her, I really love her. Besides, leaving her like this would make me feel extremely guilty. Even worse if she actually committed suicide. But I can't continue like this, I can feel myself getting more anxious and maybe even closer to depression. Something has to change.  I'm almost constantly worried that she'll commit suicide either now or in the future. I can't just shake the feeling off and hope that everything goes well. I feel so trapped and sad. I'm also afraid that I'll never be the same, and that if she actually commits suicide my life will be ruined. I want to support her but now it's starting to affect me. I have no idea what to do.

TL;DR: Long distance girlfriend is depressed and has an eating disorder, and a past of suicide attempts. She has probably gotten worse and faints almost everyday and has suicidal thoughts. She's getting help since a long time ago but I don't think it's enough. I'm worrying so much about her killing herself that my mental health is getting worse and worse.

106,"I've been friends with this guy since year 4 and he's always been kinda annoying so nobody else wanted to put up with him. I've started to dislike him these last few years but I've always tried to keep the peace. Today we were playing Overwatch and I just got so fed up with his bullshit so I yelled at him to go fuck himself. Then I wrote him multiple messages detailing why I never want to talk to him again. I told him to take some bloody responsibility for his actions and to take his inferiority complex out on someone else so he can just fucking leave me alone. I've blocked him on Discord and Whatsapp and I'm not going to talk to him anymore.

I've been fantasising about doing this for a long time but now I don't know how to feel about it. He's been one of my best friends for 6 years. I've spent a big part of my life with him and now I've just cut him of over night. I think it's for the best though. I don't know...",28Jun2019,8
107,"Excuse me if I type weird or if something doesn't make sense, talking about this is making me very anxious and I have communication issues. I would also like to note that I am seeking professional help, although things have been difficult because of traveling.   
For some background, I'd like to state that I have been doing therapy on and off for 4-ish years and have struggled with mental issues since I was 8. I do take anti-depressants, but it really hasn't helped.  
This all started earlier this year. I can't remember exactly when because I don't keep track of things when I'm in that state. Long story short, I think I've been experiencing delusions- I'm not even sure if that's what it is. I'm going to skip the paranoia that I think it stemmed from because I already (kind of) have that figured out.   
Long story short, I sometimes enter these fits that can last from fifteen minutes to several hours. During these fits/episodes/whatever they're called, I have the intense feeling that something is physically wrong with my body. I often feel like I have too many organs and wish to get rid of them- or that they're ""wrong"" and I need them gone. This applies to both internal and external organs, and sometimes smaller appendages like fingers. Basically, I feel this unnatural hate for my physical body for no reason. It just feels wrong sometimes. When I feel this way, I also have the urge to vomit but can't. No nausea, I just want to throw up because something feels stuck. I get incredibly frustrated during these episodes or whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I should mention that I've made no effort to hurt myself, and hopefully never will.

109,"So a little backstory, I’m a high school student that has been living in the Midwest area of america for about 2 years when I moved away from the Middle East, but shit happened.

 I have been hiding as I cry myself on the floor when nobody’s around because I get flashbacks of me getting bullied and attacked by my abusers for 2 years straight. Before I left to the USA I was deeply connected to my friends, since I knew them all since kindergarten, and do not have a outlet to new friendships due to this culture shock and too many differences between the people around me. Because of the size and location of my new home I’ve had no outlets to meet new people unless it was involved in the town or in the school. 

In my school there are a majority of white supremacists that have constantly thrown slurs almost every day and have a physical experiences each month I am there. Since I am the only none-Caucasian student in the school And have not a single person to back me up when being berated by insults and punches for the almost all of my experience there. Now I am visiting home for the first time but whenever I cross something that reminds me of school, America, or just plain feeling lonely I will start to have flashbacks and nightmares about the abuse.

The two most common flashbacks I get is being pushed to the corner of the classroom by 3 stronger and racist students in my class, I remember as half the class were on the other side of the room minding their own business and talking normally I was literally pushed into the corner of the room and kicked on the ground, after the instance because there were no witnesses and apparently 3 are more believable than 1 I ended up getting punished by the school. Another instance is the same three student berating me with slurs and insults and warning me if I ever speak up they will call the teacher and say I had called them a slur for Caucasian people.

Now, I was crying on the sofa remembering these clearly after a day out with some old friends as all these horrors start coming back to me in my mind, this isn’t the first time this week ether and I knew when I was in-school I would regularly get anxiety attacks every other day.

What is wrong with me??? Why am I experiencing these things all over again in my mind??? Please someone comment to help me understand why I am acting like this!?!",28Jun2019,1

It’s like I actually can’t speak but I can say ‘here’ to the teacher. If I needed to speak I would like if I 100% needed too. But if I didn’t I would end up not saying a thing.

112,"I have never achieved anything in my life and as long as I can remember I have been below average in everything. I was never really good at anything. I was always to lazy to better myself and to dumb to realize what that would lead to. I have never been in a relationship. I am bad at reading people and even though I always have an open ear for others I can rarely give any meaningful advice. I always try to help but I usually make everything worse. Once I was actually brave enough to ask someone out and they even said yes but I was too much of a coward to actually go through with that. I think that is actually one of my biggest problems. I am a fucking coward. I am scared of most kinds of interaction. So instead of seeking help I just pretend to be fine and play dumb. As if I didn't realize that I am in a constant downward spiral.Recently I lost my job and this final gave me the rest. Since then I have barley left the house. I don't answer my phone anymore and I have basically cut all contacts with other people. My best and pretty much only friend tried to reach me but I only told him that I am fine and that work is just kinda stressful at the moment. And now I just sit around all day.

114,"I've been depressed most of my life and have had suicidal thoughts for a big part of it as well. Just passive thoughts like ""I wouldn't mind not to wake up tomorrow"", not actual plans.   
Recently I got diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 24, which explains why I always felt like the odd one, the weirdo, why I failed so much in everything I did.   
Everything. School. Social skills. Work. I can't even keep my own house tidy.   
The depression has been becoming worse lately, but it's been downright horrible the last days. I'm starting to get to know more and more about myself and realising what I've been through. I've been neglected emotionally, I don't know how to have emotions let alone express them. When I was a child my parents would threat to hit me if I started crying. I've learned NOT to show your emotions, because someone will get angry at you.   
Now I know that that is not true of course, but it has become a part of me to shove down any negative emotions.   
I'm in a horrible loop of needing help but not knowing how to express this. I feel stuck, I feel like I'm going to lose everybody and everything I do will fall apart again. I can't handle this anymore, my whole life has been a series of fuck-ups. I try, I really really try but I can't. I've never been happy and I'm slowly beginning to lose hope that I will ever be happy. I don't like the society we live in, the environment is getting screwed over but nobody is actually doing something usefull about it, I don't like careers, I just just just want to have a good day for once. 

The reason I'm writing this is because I have been struggling with extreme suicidal ideation the last days and although I'm not going to do it now, I'm scared that I will sometime. It scares the shit out of me, but I don't want this. I tried asking for help at the psychologist (ADHD) but they just think it's mild because I'm not honest about it. I never ever told anyone I feel suicidal on a regular base. I'm scared I will lose even more; my friends, my family (even my fucking parents), my life. Which is fucking ironic considering my thoughts. I just can't keep fighting anymore, I'm tired, I want to rest but it feels like the world doesn't let me. I feel like I'm only on this earth to make some time and then it ends. I've been through so much shit at this age already that I'm scared of the future. I don't know what I want to do, I don't know who I want to be, I don't know who I want to be with, picking up my life is scaring me because I failed over and over and over and every time I try I fail. I just don't see the point in trying again. 

  
I want help. I really do. But I don't believe anyone is able to truely understand and help me climb out of this void once and for all. At the moment I'm really in distress and I was thinking about actually calling the doctor's office (emergency visit because it's weekend) but I can't. I'm not even brave enough to contact one of my friends to help me out. They know I'm not well, but nobody knows how bad it really is. I'm scared they will worry. I'm scared they will have pity. I'm scared I'll be treated differently if I tell what is really going on. But it can't go on like this.   


I really want to make sure everybody knows; I'm not contemplating to kill myself within the next few days or so. But that is mainly out of fear and guilt. If there was a no consequence-button, I'd press it. And I'm afraid to think about how long the fear and guilt keep dominating the ideation.",28Jun2019,1

Hello to anyone who may read this. I am currently getting ready to go to my grandmother’s house with my mom to do her grocery shopping for her. Going to see her makes me feel terrible because she is very dramatic and has a “woe is me” attitude and tries to make everyone feel guilty. Considering I’m frequently apologizing to everyone for everything, this doesn’t mix well. I’ve been feeling myself spiral downward every night while my new boyfriend is at work because pretty much all of my friends cut me off and I don’t talk to anyone except for him. I don’t know what my deal is- it is definitely depression that sinks in but it’s so situational and short lived that I don’t take it seriously. I just chugged a bunch of coffee in an attempt to prevent it. Drinking an excess of coffee in an attempt to regulate my own mood swings is a bad idea though since last time I did this I barely slept for days and was on an extreme upswing until I took meds to knock myself out and make myself sleep for the days afterward. My new boyfriend isn’t very “there” emotionally? I’m not sure how to describe it. He’s supportive and knows about my issues on a surface level but other than that this is the most chill relationship I’ve been in. Neither of us really express emotions to each other, it’s weird. Considering I’m coming out of a several year long relationship though I guess I’m just not used to it. I’ve said I love you to him a couple times quickly in conversation and he hasn’t said it back which I don’t care about I’m just afraid I’m going to weird him out and drive him away. He isn’t very verbally affectionate and my black and white mind is having trouble coping with the lack of validation but I’m trying my absolute best to breathe and be realistic and calm. Anyway, I really hope that tonight doesn’t go too bad. Thanks for anyone that read this.",28Jun2019,2

Especially because the things that caused it haven't changed and I still have thoughts where I long to do that thing.

Basically, I want to break up with the guy I'm seeing, move out, quit my job, and just live in my car instead of moving back in with my parents. I want to do this so bad because for some fucking reason, my brain has decided that is what is going to make me happy and relieve me of a lot of the issues I'm currently facing with. When I had the meltdown, I started secretly moving out all my shit while he was asleep and called the suicide hotline twice and I had them call me again the next day. I don't feel safe or at home anywhere and I don't have anyone I feel like I can truly confide in. 

The guy I'm apparently has never dated anyone who had the issues that I have so I don't feel comfortable talking to him about any of this. He has tried to help me in his own way and while I appreciate that and it can help, it isn't what I need. And I still feel embarrassed about my episode and now I feel like he thinks I'm unstable. I think I'm mostly stable but I did have some stuff going on. I don't know who else to talk to so that's why I posted here.

130,"Everytime someone compliments me on something I feel really uncomfortable and it gets even worse when people show affection towards me. An example of this last bit can be when my dad let me read the argument that he had with my mother about her wanting to cut my hair while I slept ( It was for getting a bad grade in chemistry. She thinks that being a male student and having long hair makes teachers dislike me and grade me lower.)  

While I read that argument I felt somewhat disgusted at the fact that my dad showed genuine concern about my wellbeing, so much so that I stopped reading halfway through the conversation and just said ""I got it, I don't wanna read anymore"".

This is not new for me, I know I'm cold but I thought when it came down to it I would just be able to feel at least a little of that.

Another friend looked at me in disgust and he just walked away and never spoke with me again since the last few days.

It was only an hour later outside where the other friend said (in a nutshell) to me that I was a horrible person and should get my mental state checked for saying that. 

I only felt a little shame before that I felt like if it was said to me I would just shrug it off, but after that, over the last few days I thought about it and went through my memories.

I could only think of instances where I cared about people for selfish reason (social status, popularity, satisfaction of desire for social contact included).

I don't care about lying and manipulating people for personal gain.

The thing that's weird and why I'm certain I'm not a psychopath is that I do have a sense of shame that extends beyond my self-interest.

I went from thinking I am a cold and selfish person but nothing to bad to thinking that there might actually be something wrong with me. I feel ashamed of the second.

I'm also a 38 H chest size so that doesn't help, but it started to cause a fused vertebrae. Some days the pain is so bad I can't get out of bed.

Anyway, back to my point.

I'm prescribed 30mg of Percocet (up to five a day) and 2mg Ativan (up to three a day) and I am constantly terrified of accidental overdose.

I don't ever, ever take more than I'm prescribed, my anxiety wouldn't let me, trust me.

For some reason, whenever someone tries to help me or show me love and affection, I turn him/her away, even if accepting would benefit me.

I declined and I didn't feel any guilt or emotion. I didn't care.

I have had two relationships throughout my life and both ended rather quickly because they didn't like how I didn't show any emotion towards them. But I didn't mind. I never really wanted the relationships anyways. Both of these ended years ago, and I've only gotten ""worse"" (I don't really see any fault in my actions) since. 

Nowadays I spend every second of my free time at home, away from social interaction. I get along very well with my family, and I truly do care about them, but that's it. I don't have any friends or loved ones not related to me by blood, but that's okay. I can't really stand being around other people. They annoy me. I can spend an entire day with just my own thoughts to entertain myself, and I'd even say I enjoy it. 

Whenever I see a news article about some sort of tragedy, such someone's death, whether it be a celebrity or not, I don't feel anything. I don't care. Is that normal? I see in the comment section that there are people expressing their grief and sorrow, and all I can think about is how irrelevant it is to my life. If it doesn't affect me or my family, is it worth my time? I don't believe so.

When I see people donate to charity, I see it as a waste of money. When I hear about people going out of their way to help strangers, I think it's dumb. On the rare occasion that I interact with someone outside of my immediate family, I can only think about how much I'd rather be somewhere else, anywhere but near the person I'm speaking to. I can't get away quickly enough.

I think I'm fine just the way I am. I know how others interact with one another, and I'm not oblivious; I know that my line of thinking would be considered worrying by others. But I don't care. Their opinion is irrelevant to me. Why do people always feel the need to ""help"" me? Can't I just be left alone?

I apologize for my incoherent ramblings. I'm not sure if I even want/need help, to be truthful. I'm not sure what I want. Is this normal? Am I just a selfish jerk? Or is it deeper than that? I don't know. I don't have any disorders such as Autism or anything. I have been diagnosed with depression in the past, but I don't really believe it. I feel fine.",28Jun2019,0
139,"I’ve recently started taking lamictal ( one month ago, just reached top dose last week ) - I’m not bi-polar, rather a mood disorder. 

I’ve had mental health related problems all my life. Depression and anxiety. I’ve suffered many horrible, crippling and frankly terrifying panic attacks over the years , however, since starting Lamictal, among other not so pleasant side effects, I’ve experienced some frightening panic attacks as well as, well, really... an unknown feeling in my head.... sort of an out of body experience ? Like the world is going by faster than my brain can keep up with, like I’m running faster in my head than my body can keep up with... sort of feel as if I’m about to lose my mind. My thoughts start running and I feel like I’m loosing control. I feel like I’m tripping out during these ‘ episodes ‘.

140,"I've had some very specific fears, and I'm wondering if this is ""just"" anxiety or something else. Would really appreciate input from anyone who has experienced delusions.

I'm diagnosed with panic disorder, agoraphobia, and major depression. My anxiety typically surrounds health/dying, and end of the world. In the past I've thought a specific dictator was going to nuke my house, that my neighbor had an assault rifle and was going to shoot me through the wall, that the veins in my hand had completely disappeared and my hands weren't getting any blood, etc. Things have been calmer this past year and I can see where I might have lost touch a bit, but I can feel it ramping up again. I've applied for disability, and now I worry I'm being spied on by someone out to prove I'm just exaggerating my issues. Also I'm starting to get really worried about the 5G towers, end of the world stuff, etc. I'm sliding down a slope and can't talk about my current worries as I don't want my psychiatrist to keep messing around with my meds (even though I'm a mess, I'm still way better off than I used to be). I'm not crazy? Surely you can see with the state of the world that these are logical thoughts? Please help. What's wrong with me? Everyone around me isn't worried. I feel like I'm on an island. Are thoughts like this part of my anxiety disorder?

142,"Hello

I am going to try and summarise this all as best as I can because I don’t want you guys to have to read a long story. 

I was diagnosed with clinical depression in 2017. I have been in an in patient institution twice and I have had two psychiatrist and four therapist . It never seemed to work out and I have been with my current psychiatrist since I met her in hospital and my current therapist since last year.  

My depression has been persistent throughout my entire life. I have been sexually and emotionally and physically abused.  Emotional and physical  abuse from my parents,extend family and teachers . I have also been bullied all my life. I have trouble trusting people and I can be very paranoid. I am 24 and support my self and live alone. I am all I have; no friends or family around me. My friends that have stuck around are great but I now no longer want to speak to anyone.  A few days ago I was let go from my new job after just two months even though it was meant to be an 8 month contact. The reason they gave me was that the business needs have changed. In reflection i think they never intended to keep me.  During a meeting once the partner said he planned to hire someone junior and fire them once he got who he was actually looking for. He said this after I have joined just two weeks prior and I thought WTF. 

Since I left university, I have been raped and abused by so called friends.  My previous “relationship “ was with a narcissist who enjoyed making pejorative comments about the colour of my skin and my social background. I had a friend who was just as bad.  All encounters with men have been similar. 

This has never happened before but the other day I thought suddenly came to mind. Am I in hell? Is that why my life is constantly in shambles and I have no control over my body or mind. Is that why things are find for a short period and then a bomb explodes to destroy what I managed to salvage from the previous explosion?  I believe my doctors are here so I don’t catch on and keep suffering. My friends are here but not here . I have the illusion of support. I know I sound fucking crazy but I swear I think I am actually in hell being tortured. For the life of me I cannot think of what I did to deserve this. I know I have always been kind to people and treated them how I would like to be treated. I am not perfect but I always own up to my mistakes.  

I’ve been looking into voluntary euthanasia in Belgium because I must confront whom or whatever is doing this. I need to know what I have done to deserve this.",28Jun2019,1
143,So for about a month now there are days I feel numb (emotionally) like I can't feel anything like for example I can be talking to someone and they talk about something thats happy or sad I don't feel it I mostly on those days act the emotion but I don't feel it is this me losing my mind or what because it seems odd to me to one day feel emotions and the next day be just so numb and not feel anything,28Jun2019,1
144,"Nobody wakes up wanting to die out of no where, its after MONTHS and YEARS of having to deal with THEMSELVES. I cant speak for everyone but im speaking for me and people like me. Im so fucking tired of me. We cant just eject ourselves from our own body so you either have to fight cope and beat yourself or you fight fail at coping and kill yourself. Im 17 and this where i am in my thoughts. Im at the ""i just want it to be quiet"" stage. Im scared of what the fuck might happen later down the road. When im not living with my parents and am in the real world where shit other than your head starts piling up on you. I know one day it wont be ""i just want it to be quiet"" it'll be ""you cant kill yourself, and here are reasons why"" ""maybe you should kill yourself, youre tired, we're tired"" 

i will eventually run out of goals pushing me. Without any goals and without any parents it will be ugly. I used to wonder how people even got their head anywhere NEAR death, and now here am i predicting the future i will have without help. Or maybe even with help itll be the same. Who fucking knows man. I have a headache.",28Jun2019,1
145,I'm so fucking depressed... and I'm an addict and I have tons of mental health issues that my psychiatrist of 3 years still had no real idea 2hat exactly it all is.... mostly I'm just.... wishing I was dead. I can't commit suicide because that is too selfish. But fuck I wish I had someone try to mug someone in front of me and I could step in and stop it and get shot in the process and just die helping someone....,28Jun2019,1
146,"I feel like her character has allowed me to finally find the words to describe my own feelings of insecurity and self-hatred. Her gradual indifference to everything around her, and her hidden desires to be dominated and controlled - through sometimes violent means - as a way of finally feeling worthy to someone, just feels like someone read my thoughts out loud before I'd even written them down. I guess I secretly hoped she'd succeed by the end of the book; maybe settle into a healthy relationship, get a job, and recover from all this shit. But (spoilers) she ends up being left behind by the one person in the world she actually loves while he goes off to achieve his goals, and by the end of the story she seems so week and so hopeless and so lost. 

I don't really know how to react to all this, I know its dumb to feel helpless because a character in a book didn't experience a happy ending, but when I brought this up to my friend who had recommended it to me, she used the words 'realistic' and 'that's life.' It feels as if suddenly everything around me is telling me I'm destined to fail, and its not just in my head this time.

152,"This is sort of an odd post but I want to know if anyone has felt similarly. I think I have some sort of depression possibly brought on by my ADHD medication (vyvanse 40mg) but at the same time I have gotten to a state of self awareness where I feel like I'm too capable and smart and functioning that I don't allow myself to think about it. The next meeting with the people in charge of my medication (BUP) is in like 2 months but I feel like I can't talk to them. Neither do I feel like I can talk to anyone in my surroundings as almost every friend I had or have made thinks I'm wierd and doesn't want to hang out with me.

153,So basically for the past year I’ve just been feeling horrible and have become so insecure that I’m constantly thinking about what other people think when I try not to. Everyday just drags on and I can’t focus in school which then just stresses me out with a funny feeling in my stomach all day. And I feel like my friends and people I know want nothing to do with me. The only reason I’m posting this is because it’s my birthday today and I should be happy but I just feel anxious and I was too scared to invite anyone (that isn’t family) because I was too scared that nobody would want to come. The only thing that fills the hole is making music with friends and drawing but I can’t even do that cause school is in the way of my dreams. Idk what to do,28Jun2019,1
154,"I’m not thinking I’m absolutely worthless and about to yeet myself off a bridge, but this is something i came to realize a few weeks ago.

My friend and i were joking about this private island he’d want to build if he were to become dumb-money rich where everybody that lived there would just do something they liked that they were good at. He asked what I’d want to do. I wasn’t trying to fish for compliments, but i honestly asked him “idk what am i good at?” And i really think he avoided the question and said something like “the island whore” as a joke. Which is admittedly funny ngl, but i really don’t think he realized i was asking honestly.

I guess I’ve just really lost direction over the years and now i rlly believe myself to be a boring, unremarkable person. I have a decent face, not good enough to make a career out of it, but that’s it. The only other thing I’m decent at is understanding the needs ppl have and issues that they go through.

She has asked me to join them on their day trip but the thought of it is giving me anxiety. I've already cried thinking about it and having to respond to her. She said if I say no it's ok but I feel so so guilty and bad telling her no even though that's how I feel. I don't want her to not go because of me and regardless of whether I make plans to spend the day without her I know she will feel bad and end up staying with me and then I am going to feel bad anyway.

156,I learned this at a workshop for handling depression. When depressed it is so easy to believe all your distorted and negative thoughts... but you know what?? You can choose not to believe that. If you’re thinking to yourself “I can’t make mistakes or everyone will think I’m an idiot”..  you could recognize that it’s very self deprecating and choose not to believe it.  Everyone makes mistakes. No one is flawless. Don’t hold yourself to an impossible standard.,28Jun2019,3
