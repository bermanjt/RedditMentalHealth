0,"I am 16 my brother is 10, and I love him more than anything in this world.

Some background: I had a friend in 8th grade who committed suicide at age 13, and we all knew his older brother. For some reason, after that happened I have been afraid that I will end up like the older brother. Additionally, I was with my friend at lunch the day he died, and have always felt heavy guilt for not reading signs, or texting him, even though I was only 13 and struggling myself. 

My brother was put in a hospital last year for suicidal tendencies, when he was 9, because of his school. It was a mess for my family, because we are all so close. Some things that he said will haunt me forever and I can't believe my baby brother felt like that. He was at a hospital miles away from us for like 3 days, it was horrible.
Finally, I have been impatient and outpatient many times for suicidal ideation and self harm since the age of 14, and when this happened I had just finished an outpatient program. I was still severely depressed at this point.

So with these 3 things combined, I feel like I am overly protective of my brother. I am so scared that I will just lose him like my friends brother lost him. Knowing how close I've come to killing myself, I relate and am terrified that he will try again. This makes no sense though, because he changed schools and went through therapy and he is doing great now, living that 10 year old life. But I feel like I'm scared to leave him alone sometimes. 

I feel like I have to check on him all the time, especially before I go to bed , or after he gets really angry. My biggest fear is that I will find him and he won't be alive. Even though he is doing so much better now, I love him to death and I think my past experiences have scarred me so much that I just irrationally act this protective. I know he is okay, but sometimes I feel overwhelming fear. 

Is it normal? 
Any insight or similar experience is appreciated.

2,"I'm going to start driving soon. The thought terrifies me. At first, I was really excited but then I realized how fast cars need to be going on the highway, or how many sharp turns there are in my neighbourhood. Don't even get me started on the Canadian winter weather. My excitement is slowly being replaced with crippling anxiety. I know I need to learn how. My mom is dealing with arthritis and has troubles driving her standard, so in the coming years, I will have to drive the long distance trips. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like the second I drive, I will somehow end up crashed and either hurt someone or hurt myself. I can't get the thought of all the possible things that could go wrong out of my head.

3,"Without giving too many details, a friend of mine (F, in her 20’s) found her mom after she committed suicide. 
This is the worst thing she has ever been through and I would like to gently recommend some type of therapy to help her heal when the time is right. She doesn’t have mental health issues and has never been to therapy, so I don’t think she would be one to seek it out herself. 
Does anyone have any advice for a specific type of therapy for these circumstances? Are there specialties? 
We are in the US. 
Thanks in advance. ",14Feb2019,1
4,"at are all the single ladies and gentlemen doing over Valentine's Day?

I've been single for years and it never helps having anxiety, loneliness and depression but I suppose it's just another day like Christmas to act like you care when the rest of the year is spent forgetting people, I think you shouldn't need to have set days per year to care more about other people it should be a regular occurrence, people show off their partners online or the presents they get for yuletide.

If I had someone worth any effort, I'd wine and dine her, throw scented rose petals at her feet, nurture them while snuggling up on the couch watching a movie, whisper sweet lullabies all evening, then at bed time I'll be fast asleep, can't give them everything at once lol",14Feb2019,1
5,"I’m apathetic. Not completely but I can barely feel emotion, except for anger frustration and sadness. I was diagnosed with MDD but when I was on SSRIs they made me more apathetic, but content with it. I think the only reason I was depressed was because I couldn’t feel certain emotions. It’s taken a toll on my relationships and friendships, as I am currently single and my friendships are on shaky ground. I’ve been off of the SSRIs for a while now and I don’t really feel sad except for when I think about how my problem affects my relationships with other people. Is there any way that I could get treatment for this? If not what should I do? Thanks",14Feb2019,1
6,"Has anyone been to see a doctor or therapist as a result of a break up/divorce?

7,"My doctor keeps upping doses of medication for me, waits, and then changes my medication because the prior one didn't help. I've tried about 4 different medications the past 6ish months? Nothing seems to help me. The only thing that changes with each medication is my appetite and energy levels, I'm either hunger all the time or rarely at all, or I am super sluggish and feel like I am crawling through the day.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to not being able to fall or stay asleep, which mirtazapine has helped with. But I still have nightmares. I still have racing thoughts, suicidal thoughts. I spend a lot of time in my mind, with that being said I end up convincing myself that there isn't anything wrong with me. Maybe I force myself to feel this way, force myself to be unhappy and thats why the medicine doesn't work, it can't fix what isn't broken?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure what kind of answer I am looking for. Has anyone else been through medications and nothing helped? Whats the next step? 

I *feel* like I try. At work I crack jokes to make people laugh, I smile and greet strangers. I listen and try to get involved with the world and people around me. But  I feel exhausted. It wares me down because I don't feel genuine, its not how I actually feel. ",14Feb2019,1
8,"Okay, let me start with some background. 

I have been on both sides of the coin: Single for a while and in a long relationship.

My girlfriend recently broke up with me out of the blue moon not too long ago and it certainly hit me like a bag of bricks. Anyways with all of this alone time on my hands now, I have been thinking about what makes me happy and the thing that always came to mind is a girlfriend;Some one to care for.

I feel my best trait is how loving I can be. I get pure enjoyment and happiness from making my special someone happy. I could do anything for them and be perfectly fine with it.

I do not know why, but with out that special someone there for me to love and make happy, I don’t feel happy. Like a piece of me is missing. 

After Hockey, I miss talking to a girlfriend about it, and how they want to talk to me and wonder how it went. Knowing that I’m that “special” person to someone else also makes me feel happy. 

I want someone I can say “goodnight” and “good morning” to. I feel lost with out doing that. It feels natural to me.

Now some may say this is just my reaction to my girlfriend breaking up with me. That is probably a reason to an extent, I do not believe it is the main reason. I feel this way even long after a breakup where  I’m totally over that person but still have that urge to have someone to love.

Obviously I have my parents and brothers and plenty of friends that love and support me and are there for me, but even still I need that girlfriend to give my love to.

Why is this? I have tried to stop it but it seems like this is just who I am. It stinks that girlfriends are a necessity for me to feel very happy. However when I am with a girlfriend that I truly like and vise versa I cannot be more happy.

9,"Been thinking about my childhood lately, while going through a very difficult time.  Just remembered that, as a pre-teen, my mum used to repeat that she had a heart disease and would die soon.  

&amp;#x200B;

A little background; she spoiled the hell out of me and even though I was a normal, though needy, kid, she could barely control me.  At that time, two of my classmates lost their mother.  One, struck particularly home as I had attended his birthday party only a few month before, with his mother beaming by his side.  

Probably, when I confided to her how afraid I was I'd lose her, she cooked up this brilliant idea.  Just now, the nightmares and crying in the middle of the night spring back to mind.  I'd dream all sorts of weird stuff, with her always being dead or on her deathbed.

&amp;#x200B;

Also just remember she could be oddly possessive, I wasn't allowed to sleep in my own room (although I had one) up until 13 or 14 years old.  Her sister (who was a doting but way way off person, and enabled my mother's similar behavior) was trying to scare the hell out of me, saying dead dogs buried in a nearby yard would come and take me.  I'm ashamed and laugh at myself now for even considering such crap at that age, although said room was the only room in a good condition on the top floor of our house, so it was a bit off putting being the only person on that entire floor.  

&amp;#x200B;

But still, I feel my mother and her family poured all their fears and 'crazy' in me.  I thought I was over it, as this was decades ago, but now I'm not so sure......  Is this excusable behavior, considering this was almost half a century ago, or what?",14Feb2019,1
10,"I'm in such a bad state mentally right now. School has never been so hard.
So I have Algebra this semester. I thought it would be easy to stay caught up. Plot twist, I get the worst case of the cold I've ever hard and miss 4 days, and I was so sick on the 5th day that I slept through most classes. My grade drops to a 55, I quickly do makeup work and it rises to a 63. Now, I'm failing and have no idea what we're learning. I tell myself that I'll just wait until next unit and stay caught up. I must be cursed because neither my alarm nor my mom's went off on the day she introduced the unit. So now I'm completely lost with a huge test tomorrow. Oh, and my biology grade dropped to a 34 due to my absences and according to my teacher, there's nothing he can do because most were group assignments that I wasn't here for. So now, I have 2 test tomorrow, a project due that I've procrastinated for a week due tomorrow, multiple worksheets, and about 8 makeup assignments ALL due tomorrow. When I get home from school, im on the brink of passing out. My motivation to do anything is gone and I can't seem to make myself try. I would have to start going to bed quite early if I wanted to have any sort of energy throughout the day, but when I get home I like to stay up and have atleast a few hours to myself. I hate how I have to dedicate 43 hours to school a week, I just want a BREAK. Im doing my project, some HW, and studying tonight, but no way in hell am I about to stay up all night to do 8 missing assignments. Freshman year is not going well for me.",14Feb2019,1
11,"This end up being a giant rant:

I get really bad anxiety surrounding school. I have already dropped out of one school and moved back in with my parents. I just enrolled in a local community college and went to meet with a counselor to look at classes. I arrived for the meet an hour early because of my anxiety. After the meeting I almost ran to my car not being able to breath with tears in my eyes. My mom asks what she can do and it’s so hard to tell her I get anxiety because I think I’m stupid and won’t amount to anything. Last night we talked about figuring out about career that don’t need degrees in but my dad was so against it. I don’t think he understand any of the things I’m struggling with. I just feel so lost because i don’t think I belong where almost everyone else is my age. I always planned that if college didn’t work out I would join the military. I can’t do that now because they won’t accept anyone with mental health illnesses in medication. I don’t know what I’m suppose to do.",14Feb2019,1

14,"So, in my teen years I experienced depressive/manic symptoms. Ya know; lethargy, irrational anger, deep sadness, wildly happy moods, etc. A couple weeks before I turned 19, I got on a hormonal contraceptive pill. Before long, my mood balanced out, intrusive thoughts quit, and now I am basically your average neurotypical person. A whole psychology degree later and I now understand that my symptoms could have been caused by a severe case Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder or PMDD. But no big, right? Birth control fixed me up... 

I’ve been on the pill for almost 4 years now. And my mental state is still pretty awesome. But... I have no libido. I’m not even 23 yet and it’s just gone. Now I don’t know if it’s because of the pill or what, but I’m scared to go off it or change it because what if the whole mental illness thing comes back?? I want my libido back, but I need to be neurotypical. I’m applying for jobs that require psychological screenings. Not dealing with those symptoms has helped me get ahead. But my lack of libido is harming my relationship and causing negative thoughts and feelings. What do I do?

Also, I have an appointment in less than a month. I’ll talk to my doctor about it, but I want different perspectives and ideas first. Thank you!",14Feb2019,1
15,"My family looks down on me. I can’t ever keep a job or a relationship. I always get too stressed and frustrated at jobs and end up leaving/not showing up. I can’t find my niche anywhere. I seriously want to work, I have no problem working 12 hours a day or more doing something I enjoy but I keep getting high stress low pay and I feel like i’m wasting my time. I have so much goals I’d love to accomplish but because I can’t keep a job I feel I’ll never make it and I just wanna take drugs and be as fucked up as I can be because I’m so miserable and want to be numb. Every relationship I have gets ruined either by me or by them. I use to always be around friends, talking to girls and now I literally spend time alone 24/7 and I wake up everyday to no messages on my phone. I deleted all social media except Snapchat because people make me feel worthless seeing what they have and how I’m failing in life. I been in a weird place lately. Not seeking a mate, no ambition to be with friends, no ambition to have sex, just legit want to be high 24/7. It’s never been this bad before.",14Feb2019,1
16,"So, I sit at a lunch table with a bunch of people. While we are sort of friends. I just prefer to not talk much and they have a little inner circle from before I got there. So as much as we enjoy each other company. They know nothing about me except my name, and I have no intention of getting to know them much more. Anyway.

I was eating lunch and talking when this girl. Let’s call her Sara, cause I don’t know her actual name was crying. And some guy at our table was holding her. She talks about having a boyfriend so I don’t if they were together. But was crying and I leaned over to listen. She said she was either feeling suicidal or tried killing her self again. I’m not sure as she was sobbing and they certainly weren’t going to tell me. She said something about not being able to tell her parents cause they’d punish her. I don’t know if it’s true, I’m just going off what I heard say. One person told her to talk with a counselor but she said the counselor would tell her parents. She eventually calmed down and laughed it off.

It was really concerning and I want to know more, and help if I can. But I have very little of their trust. She definitely won’t spill her guts and will probably just tell me not to worry about it. I did try asking one person in the group and he said he didn’t know (though I don’t believe him as they were dating for a while). And I don’t want to tell a teacher or something because of what she was saying was true, she’ll be punished by her parents. 

So I’m wondering what would be good to do. She won’t tell me, and based off what she said, she’ll be punished if her parents figure out. But I don’t know if it’s true. Should I do anything? Or just leave it alone? Please be aware she has very little trust and we know nearly nothing about each other.

17,"I've always felt waves of emptiness that come and go for a month or two at a time. About 2 months ago I felt like I could feel myself getting more and more worn down, I was sleeping about 4hrs a night. The night before this incident I ripped every single one of my eyelashes out my eyes, because it felt one thing after another kept going wrong and I was at my wits end. The next morning I had an argument that got out of hand with my sister, I think something in me snapped and I started getting hysterical. I ripped my hair out, punched my face a load, then got a vase and hit my face with it. My dad had to take me to hospital as it shattered and tore up my face pretty bad I couldn't even see as there was so much blood in my eyes and I had to get stitches. I told the hospital I fell and hit my head on the floor so nothing ever came of it.

It terrifies me thinking about it because it feels like I blanked out and saw red at the time, I wasn't in control of myself. I don't want it to happen again but im starting to feel the same as I did in the weeks before it happened. I don't understand what is wrong with me and what can I do?

19,"Sorry this is mostly just me getting something off my chest but I don't understand why things are the way they are for me. Why can't I live a normal life anymore? I was going perfect until about 22 when this shit kicked in and now I'm utterly helpless. I can't make it a week on my own, my parents support me and they're the only reason I keep going. I'd happily be dead this minute and I've tried several times but they're so fucking good to me, all they offer is unconditional love and support. And killing myself would be robbing them of a huge part of their life. I can't logically do that to them and only try when I'm bad into my psychosis but it feels like an when rather than if situation, like it'll happen regardless I just don't know how much longer I'll hold out. 

Honestly all of my trouble with the situation comes from them. They're so good, they're all anyone could possibly want from their family. They drive me to my doctor's appts every week. They drive me to see my therapist. They drive me to every group and treatment they can possibly find. They would literally die for me, and it kills me to say that becaus I don't deserve it but it's true. 

Idk I'm mostly just mad at the injustice of it, I honestly don't know a single thing they could have done better and they will still have to burry one of their children to ""preventable"" causes.",14Feb2019,1
20,"Hey everyone :) I´m a 21 and I fear that I might have a mental condition like borderline or something similar. It runs in my family, my grandmother has a severe case of it. Ivé struggled mentally since childhood. There´s a lot of factors, but the main being that ivé always, always tried to do my very best to overcome whatever might trouble me, and yet nothing has improved. I don´t get better, my days are like a fucking roller coaster of emotions and I don´t think its normal. I don´t think my behavior and the way I think is normal. I figured I was just having trouble living by myself as a teen, being stressed with school and such.  But Ivé moved back with my parents and lived here for the past 2 years, and nothing has improved. My mental state hasn´t changed one bit and honestly, I don´t think it can. When I get my bad days there´s nothing I can do to prevent it.   


I think ivé been in denial about my own mental state. I don´t want a label on me, but at the same time, I realise that I need help.  


I recently messaged my aunt to ask her if she could support me. I´m probably going to set up a doctors appointment soon.

21,"Before I begin I just want to clarify that I am rather young (17M) and still have a ways to go before understanding all of my emotions and interactions with life. 

I write this now because I can feel a breaking point coming along and last time that happened I was a complete mess but to the outside world it was just another day. Opening up has never been easy for me and the last time I wrote anything like this was at my previous breaking point where I thought I’d change and be more open but here I am. Being the way I am, saying anything about how I feel negatively has made me criticize myself with any possible remark from being selfish to over dramatic to even just being stupid for complaining about my life.

Nevertheless, since October I have felt like my life has been on a good track and I could finally improve social aspects of my life (new friends, relationships, etc.). I got diagnosed with ADD and saw massive improvements in my life through the medication. My best friend actually moved in with my family and I due to school safety issues and he’s been my motivation of getting in shape by being my gym partner. I have great friends, a good home life, improving my health and have gotten a part time job I like. Everything couldn’t be better at face value.

(I don’t know how to transition without making it seem like forced dramatizing so I guess this will do)

In order to not bother my family I keep almost everything I feel negatively to myself. I know most people say bottling stuff up is dangerous and I know, but my family has too many of their own problems and putting my problems out for them to see will only cause frustration within my family. I deal with a lot of self confidence/love issues as well as social anxiety that I have tried to control but it seems as though my body is not as easily convinced as my mind.

Even with these thoughts I normally live a pretty happy life if I just go blind and ignore them. That is until I “leak” in a sense. I can go on through my normal day and randomly I will start feeling “weird” for the lack of a better term. Once this happens I’ll go a couple of weeks with this feeling and lose all motivation, interest, energy, appetite, feel extreme loneliness and have a persistent dull headache the entire time. I’ve never thought of myself as depressed but just going through depressive phases. This has been going on since starting middle school 6 years ago and it only gets worse each year. 

Because of my family’s relationship with mental illness (brother, sister, and mother have depression and my father thinks they just need to “suck up and push through” but still supports them getting help) I have always felt that my issues are mine alone and I’m the only one who can fix them. I see the effects my siblings issues bring on my family and have always been one to never cause ripples so because of this being so deeply imbedded into my mindset I’d rather drown before asking my family for a helping hand. I say to myself and even imagine someone telling me to get out of my own way but even just writing this I’ve thought about deleting everything and go on not having anyone know of what I feel. I dread the thought of anyone I know seeing inside my head for what it really is because it differs so much from what I present outward. 

I can’t deny I haven’t contemplated suicide before but I’ve never taken action or even thought about going through with it, only how’d I do it and what I’d leave behind in a note. My main worry about myself is not if I can live with it but more of if I don’t get help will I drive myself crazy and induce some sort of psychosis. 

I know this is all over the place but I don’t know of any other way to express what I’m feeling besides writing a novel explaining absolutely everything. I don’t even know what I’m looking for in a response but I do know I need to write this for myself. To anyone that took the time to read this, have any input?",14Feb2019,1

Basically people flail around the label depression when they hit even slightest curb in life. I came from a 3rd world country, where my best friends slept on the street. You cry about depression there and they will slap you back to school, so you can work on improving that A to A+. Then I came to the west, where I was in that self-labelled state of depression due to being a foreigner, that looking back years from, acknowledge the fact I was weak, it was my fault for not seeking to improve my life and pushing everyone away. Then after I didn't find employment, had no idea where my life was headed, I was in another one of those self-labelled depressions, where a couple of months later, with renewed focus and commitment (voluntary work, excessive applications and contentiously remodeling resume), I got the kind of job I always wanted. Now all is good yadde yadde yadde and I am resenting myself for not doing everything a few years sooner, how much better my life would be if I applied myself in more areas of life, how much more successful I could've been. Oh well. But this has solidified my viewpoint on depression.

&amp;#x200B;

The same applies to people who suicide when they have the opportunities and facilities available in the west. And I am no fucking sympathies to wealthy people who OD. The less dumb people there are in this world, the better it is for me. This world already has enough. ",14Feb2019,1

Today me and my boyfriend were expecting tax his tax returns and it was going to help so much with bills . But the money went to his college debt. He curse , hit the door and went to the store. I just sat there wondering how o can help him and make him feel better but I was all ready having an anxiety attack from when I was abused as a kid. Any loud screaming and punching triggers me. He talked to him mom while he was gone and told him to kick me out.  

I do not work. When I do work every second is me having an anxiety attack. I try so hard to do a good job out of anxiety and not wanting to hear the criticism.  I come home paranoid that I did something wrong and was suicidal . My last boss yelled at me because a dust bunny landed on a light stand . I cleaned houses and I just accepted more work because some one had to have surgery and hadn't had a day off in weeks . And took more work every time she asked . The persons house I was cleaning messed up everything to say i didn't . So I guess at this point she was mad. But I didn't take that disrespect and didn't think it was worth it so I quit. 

Anyways now it's night time and my bf went to work.he asked me to look for a job. But I am terrified , i can't all to people without having anxiety.  I can't me hovered over because of anxiety.  I can't disappoint because of anxiety.  And I just want to die. 
You ever feel like it's not fair that people can just live their life? Just never feeling this pain every day? Ugh and I get it . One person shouldn't have to do all the work. But it's hell . I don't know what to do . 

My birthday was yesterday and we did nothing ... Can't afford it which I get . But still sucked. We were gonna get a less broken bed and ugh and we are fighting out of stress and I just want to be able to provide without feeling like everything is too much.

34,"Hey guys,

I want to start off by saying that my boyfriend is a beautiful human being and is someone I plan on creating a future with. He has many great qualities: intelligence, kindness, integrity, etc. This post is in no way to put him down, but it is merely to find solutions. 

To put it simply: a) I think he's a hypochondriac b) its depleting my energy and giving me anxiety 

&amp;#x200B;

He has had many episodes where in which he has exaggerated the level of pain and the symptoms. This time was an instance where he has been on the keto diet (low carb, no gluten, meat-based diet). During this diet, you are supposed to refeed on carbs every so often. He refed and threw up almost instantly. The thing is, he didn't just throw up, he was scream groaning for hours. His whole family and I couldn't decipher if he was exaggerating or in serious pain. Three days since then, he has had some diarrhea, severe anxiety, has been searching all hours of the day and night about whats wrong with him, not sleeping, groaning very load, and completely obsessing over it. He seems to be fine during the day but at night he is groaning and walking around the bedroom and obsessively googling his symptoms all night long. I hear him struggling and groaning in the bathroom. He is keeping me up at night. I woke up two nights ago to his scream groaning for hours in the bathroom and he ended up giving himself a hemorrhage because he was forcing things out of his body. Last night he thought he was having a heart attack and that he was going to die and I calmed him down until he relaxed. He is obsessively scratching at his body all night long until he is bleeding. He has refused to go to a doctor because its too expensive despite his parents offering to pay for it. He asked his dad dramatically how to write a will. He ate chili today and instantly thought he became itchy (30 seconds after eating it and despite the fact that he's been scratching himself for days) because he was allergic to it. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr I have spent so much money buying him medicine, ubering him around, losing all of my sleep, my anxiety is shooting through the roof and not getting work done because of it. I am completely drained in more than one way. I am staying somewhere else tonight.

 

What do I do? I am at a loss. I don't know how much of this is an exaggeration. I have no one to talk to about this out of fear that I will embarrass him.  He says he thinks its food poisoning. ",14Feb2019,1

36," I was browsing Reddit tonight and stumbled upon a specific post that had very much in common with my current situation.

This girl was telling about how she had to report her ex for harassment and had been told by her friends to file a restraining order on the former boyfriend. She went on to describe that this ex was manipulative and controlling, and I fear that the person being discussed is me.

Over the past year-and-a-half, I have done everything in my power to support and nurture this girl. She has very bad anxiety and depression and has panic attacks somewhat frequently. Over our time together, I have been able to help her through these by being firm and direct. And every time I have done this, she has thanked me. She thinks that I've saved her life, but in reality, she also saved me. I finally found her. I never believed in ""the one"" until I met her, and then i was hooked

I hate controlling people. I'm fine with controlling myself, but responsibility for others has always erked me. But not with Her. For my gf, I would do almost anything if it meant she was safe from harmful thoughts and actions.

Only recently has she learned of my mental issues, specifically with stress and anxiety, but I cannot believe she has left me high and dry without even explaining why she left. If this girl posting is the woman I wanted to spend my life with, then I am devastated and in complete ruin over what she thought of me (manipulative and controlling). I only wanted to protect her from her own demons. And i failed...

The last words she said to me were:

""I'm sick of you. I'm getting an RA and filing a Title IX""

In her post, she referred to me as the love of her life. Even though she has hurt me, I too would say she is the love of my life. She's my muse, my best friend, my everything. I just dont know why it had to end like this. 

I'm going to give her time and space, and hopefully, things will work out and I can see her without making her feel upset. All I know is that she is doing everyrhing in her power to forget about me and ditch any thought of us being together in the future.

I fear for her safety everyday, but it is not my place anymore. But someday, I would like for it to be...

I will always love you, DPD.

Love, G

41,"Diagnosed bipolar 2 in mid December thanks to my wife recognizing I had issues. Started marital counseling at same time. After living alone in our house with nothing but a mattress and lawn chair for 6.5 months she moved back in with my 14 month old daughter. I screwed up bad before. I have been gambling since I was 18 (now 34) Poker, sports betting, fantasy sports. One of the many things I obsessed over and got stuck on over the years. I revealed to her that I had racked up 30k in debt and that’s when she left and rightfully so.  I successfully kicked that habit during this 6 months period and kicked my over-drinking habit. I haven’t gambled at all and haven’t been drunk at all. I learned to enjoy the little things in life and even quit watching tv. I developed a friendship with a man that happens to be gay. He is also bipolar. He is older. He was there for me. He helped me maintain my composure and no doubt helped me get my family back. Before my wife moved back in there Were several times I was convinced and got stuck on the myth she was cheating on me. I went manic (didn’t know it then) during those nights. I smoked crystal meth on those 5-6 occasion via hitting off someone else’s pipe. It calmed me down. Allowed me to not be stuck and obsess over my wife and somehow allowed me to sleep. So once again I am hiding something from my wife. In my mind I wasn’t really doing wrong bc it was the end of my world on those nights. When we started counseling I did not have any more of those episodes. She moved back in and everything was wonderful. Happiest times of my life to be around the love of my life again and my precious baby. I did make it known to her months before that I had a new friend that was very important to me. We hung out 4-5 times every week and he listened to me without judging and without any personal gain for himself. I wanted to keep him around as a close friend. I wanted to be loyal Bc I have never been a good friend. I’ve alwys been stuck on my own BS. She was skeptical and thought I was cheating on her with him. I got into her gmail account and caught her ordering survellience equipment. We got over that and finally my friend and my wife started to get along. Then I took a deep plunge down a rabbit hole from all the info I stole from her gmail account. Things i couldn’t unsee. It would turn out to be my demise. I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t eat. I couldn’t hardly function at all during the times I was obsessed.  I was sure she was cheating. I was even ok if she had but I wanted the truth. She took a polygraph. Passed with flying colors. I was good for about 4 days. Then went right back down the hole again. Accusing her. Telling her I wasn’t going to leave her side until she confessed. So I was manic again and wouldn’t learn what manic was until after all this. I threatened to burn her clothes over text messages. I was once again at the end of my world. That night I demanded another friend get me coke. The guy didnt have enough so I spent $100 on Crystal. I spent another $100 on champagne. Another $80 on dinner. This was her money. Not mine. So we smoked it all and then we picked up all the clothes and hung everything back up in the closet. I scared her bad. Fast forward a few days and I became obsessed again for a long time. Was on like 4 hours of sleep in 3 days (didn’t smoke meth) and badgered her until she left the house and Called cops. I had stored my little bag with a pipe and bags in there. Was scared to remove it from house. I had packed up my stuff and put in car prior to this hoping she would confess. So I felt it was a good time to take the bag to my car so I could toss it in the morning. So I waked our door and had two cops instantly searching me. There was a dusting of crystal still in there and I went to jail. I’ve now lost my wife and my child and my 8 year old has lost her step mom whom she now adores and her sister. She was balling today when I had to tell her how I messed things up and probably wouldn’t get to be with my wife again. I went to doctor a couple days after jail and got put on additional medication to control manic episodes. I have learned methods to take me out of a manic state before it peaks. I take 100 deep breaths and it’s working. I am checking into rehab tomorrow lord willing. I don’t have a meth addiction but it’s where I have gone when manic and that’s a problem. I’m gonna do 30 days there. I am terrified. To be stuck with my own thoughts without the loves of my life. I have a new psychotherapist that I am supposed to see next week. I am submitting my life to God and giving what I have left to him because thee is no other way. My wife is divorcing me next week. I keep disappointing her. I want to give her a normal life full of love. That she deserves. I cannot imagine loving another soul more than I love her. I’m just learning about manic and how to combat it. I would do anything to have even a 1 percent change of being with her and my daughter. I’m hurting so bad. I don’t know what to do. My wife thinks I’m cheating on her with a man, turning tricks for drugs and smoking meth daily. I can’t Change what she thinks Bc I can’t talk to her. I have a drug test coming up. And then this rehab. I’m just lost. Is there any hope for me?",14Feb2019,1

46,"Smoking cannabis as teenager could increase the risk of depression in adulthood by almost 40 per cent, a landmark study by Oxford University has found. Researchers warned that use of the drug in adolescence may be responsible for around 60,000 cases of the condition in subsequent decades - around one in 14 of all cases.

They urged parents to be less relaxed about teenage use of cannabis, warning that some of the strains being pushed today are 10 times as strong as the drugs which were dealt 30 years ago.

And they called on ministers to prioritise prevention of drug taking, warning that the damage caused by cannabis was now a public health risk with “devastating” consequences.

The research examined 11 major studies involving more than 23,000 individuals from adolescence until their 30s.

It found that those who tried cannabis in their teens had a 37 per cent higher risk of depression between the ages of 18 and 32, and more than three times the risk of attempting suicide.

I'm posting asking for advice on how to help my significant other. He's 24 and living in Geneva, Switzerland for the time being and I live in the States. 

He had a previous history of self-harm, and went to therapy consistently for a few years and was on medication. According to him, he didn't notice an improvement with therapy or medication, though he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  He has had suicidal ideations every day for the last couple years (since starting college). I've supported him through all of his bad thoughts (he goes through days where the negative thoughts are really bad, and then other days where he is able to keep the thoughts at bay). He's also told me that he believes he might commit suicide by the time he turns 30. He frequently attributes his mental health problems to childhood physical and emotional abuse. His relationship with his parents, however, has since significantly improved. 

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever I push him to seek professional help or to talk to his mother (who he is very close to)  he always says that ""therapy won't help,"" and that he doesn't want to worry his mother because it's not that bad. I could reach out to his mother or try to reach therapists in Geneva and set up an appointment anyway. I KNOW he needs help but I just don't know if I go behind his back to do so.

Not sure how to feel, but part of me is relieved somewhat to know what’s wrong. I’ve been prescribed numerous antidepressants over the years and never did take a single one because I was afraid of them, except Paxil I did take once and it messed me up pretty bad I got extremely unsettled and agitated on it and then became pretty much bedridden because of total exhaustion and not caring about anything. My doctor decided to try again and gave me Cymbalta which I haven’t taken yet either, I’m glad I didn’t because after another in depth visit to him, he asked me a ton of questions and had me answer some and diagnosed me as bipolar II. He is now starting me on Lamictal 25 mg and working slowly up. I haven’t taken either Cymbalta or Lamictal yet he thinks the Lamictal will help level out my moods and with anxiety. I’m actually somewhat hopeful about it. I just wanted to know what was wrong. I’ve even been doing some CBD oil and it has helped with anxiety but only to a point. Hasn’t helped at all with my mood swings. I hear a lot of horrible stuff about Cymbalta so am nervous about it.

I pretty much grew over attached to my false reality which was probably why I was stuck in that daydream for so long. I don't  remember much of what happens in my daydream but I remember getting out of it. I basically just looked in the mirror(so cliche, I know) and realized that my whole social life was made up. Then I continued to pull a Bella Swan in the middle of my room. Fun times. I've gotten better at not letting myself get like that with my daydreams, but I wonder if anyone eles had somthing like this happen to them. Looking back, it sounds pretty wierd to cry because your ""life"" isnt real. I find it kind of amusing remembering my overdramatic reaction (even tho i still admittedly have mini moments like this still) Anybody eles has,""I made my entire life up and it's all a lie"" moments?

66,"Sorry as this may be very long. So I am a university student (20f), and not until this year did I feel really shameful of myself socially.

I have been diagnosed with OCD, depression and GAD but not SAD or any mental health disorders related to social ability.

I used to be very confident in myself until my boyfriend and I split up after 3 years, I think it may have caused me to either lose confidence or I just didn't know how to handle people because I spent my time primarily with him.

I tried to get a little more involved in school activities like a leadership position for orientation for freshman. This other student who was running training gave me the wrong date and time so I sat their waiting until she came and ""apologized"", I genuinely believe it was on purpose. Later I tried to still help students by offering an invite to a party I knew was happening and also showed them a website to getting free/cheaper books, this was in a group chat run by students. Someone who is on our student council later reprimanded me for my actions and said they were innapropriate. This has still stuck with me and I'm constantly self-conscious for it, and it is brought up again later.

I recognized my failures in being social so I tried my hand at just casual sports my school hosts, and I still enjoy it and still attend. However, that same student council member, I made a comment too, by accident, had taken offense but I did not realize the offense, there was also someone else there who witnessed it and was upset by my actions and now I still constantly feel guilty. This student council member had in a way reported me to a student manager and we had to all have a ""mediated discussion"", in which I had to apologize, I didn't mind I genuinely felt bad about my actions. However, I still feel the guilt, I had also apologized to the other student as well, but feel like this is situation really screwed me up, I had even told the student manager I think it will negatively effect my health to have the mediation, but I was told I had to go.

There has been other instances, like my sister and grandmother had been in the hospital and this caused a lot of anxiousness so I had missed work days (this was a job for the uni), I had ended up getting fired despite it being a position for students who are in financial need.

I still, unfortunately talk to my ex (I have a post about it if anyone wants to check it). He had later told me about this girl I know and he knows as well, who had told him I made my entire university hate him and how I was a bitch and weird, because I invited everyone to a party no one wanted to go to. I felt terrible because I already felt like I was a terrible awkward person for it and now it really is confirmed that I'm creepy. It is also stung because I had given her a free textbook of mine because she was low on funds.

My question is, how do I cope with my awkwardness or embrace it at least. I constantly feel anxious, embarassed and guilty.  I also want to know straight up, based on what I've said, am I a bad person?  

I cannot go on medication due to other health reasons and therapy made me anxious. I don't feel suicidal or anything like that, I just want to know if its my personality thats a problem or is my self-consciousness making myself feel bad? Also if anyone •may• have an idea on what might have caused this change in me.

Thank you for anyone who takes the time to read this. I may delete this a little later just in case someone from my university saw this.",14Feb2019,1

70,"I know I need to see a therapist but I’m wondering if these symptoms match up or if my anxiety has just gotten worse. I am currently 20 years old and know for a fact I suffer from anxiety but when I was 17 I went through a very traumatic event.

My parents have been divorced since I was a child and around when I was 15 my mom began dating someone new. We all liked him 
 and my mom and him were even talking about marriage. About two years later when I was 17 he killed himself. It was very unexpected and I even told my mom not to worry when she went to his house to check on him. Sadly she was the one that found him. 
I’ll never understand the pain and trauma she has endeared but soon after she began to mentally lose it and slip into psychosis. She began wearing all his clothes and signing her name as his, started to have a jesus complex, and would spend hours a day driving around taking pictures of random stuff. As well as pouring coffee grounds all over our floor to see footprints because he was coming “back”. I didn’t realize she had gotten so bad until I came back from school one day and she wouldn’t let me in the house she kept us all outside and then took us to a weird barn nearby. I was terrified she was going to kill me and my sister. She got help and would occasionally slip back into it. I was always worried she would one day crack and kill us. 

She’s Better now and on the right medication but I still have lasting impacts from this. I can’t help but think about it and I keep wishing something else traumatic would happen to me so I could at least explain to people why I act sometimes because I can’t tell people  I get intrusive thoughts and bouts of panic and still get uncomfortable brining people over. I don’t know what to do I don’t want to talk to anyone because I feel so ashamed of all this.

74,"I am in second year of high school!

So, I have been watching a YouTuber by the name of David Dobrik. Not to the point of obsession. But to the point of I enjoy his content to come back for every video.

I admire him. I think I am now subconsciously and semi-consciously trying to act like him. I try to be more “witty”, I also basically changed my mental attitude. I went from normally “stoic” and unfriendly, to “funny” and sociable. 

The thing is I feel mixed emotions. I recently have gotten confessed to by multiple girls within the timeframe of me starting to act more like David. I have also gained a large friend group of people I talk to every day. I am really into this one girl that had confessed to me. Normally this would be a great thing. But I am concerned that if I were to change “idols” and act differently my personal relationships would fall apart. I don’t want that. I feel like a “fake” person. I don’t like this feeling. Now I feel as though I am trapped in this persona. I also feel as though I don’t know or remember how I acted before I took on this persona. I also don’t want the group of friends to fall apart. I am at its core, I keep them together. If they don’t have me they will fall apart. I am there for the “comical relief”, because I’m “close” to every single one of them. This is stressful in its own way. Maybe it’s best I don’t act as the glue.

I don’t like this feeling. I also don’t know how deal with this. I’ve been thinking that just cutting of my current “friend” group and just trying to change into what I feel is me. 

So basically, is this normal? How do I deal with this “dreadful” feeling? What do you think the best course of action would be right for me to take.

Some songs are played again and again in loop in my head when I cry. I cant stay serious at all. I bite my nails too much, fidget a lot, and tend to interrupt people during crucial conversations.

So I'm 19 years old, a female, and I just came to college in August 2018. I have struggled with mental illness since I was like 6th-ish grade. I started cutting when I got dumped by my first girlfriend. (I can't move on. It was so long ago but I've never moved on 100%) It wasn't to manipulate her or anything, it was just the only way I knew how to deal with the crushing heartbreak I felt. Things got worse. January of 2015, I took about 15 OTC sleeping pills; they didn't kill me. Things continued to get worse. My mother began to cheat on my father. Thanksgiving weekend 2015, my mother dragged me and my younger sister to her lover's house two hours away. I hated it. When we came back, my father pretty much knew but didn't say anything. Then, my mother, had me lie about our Christmas plans. With the threat of the impending nuclear meltdown that was my family, I took two bottles of OTC sleeping pills and waited to die. My parents found me but were going to leave me. My sister begged them to take me to the emergency room. I was hospitalized overnight in the emergency room before being sent to the loony bin for a week. I got out Christmas Eve, though my mother still dragged me down to her woman's house. I fought the urge to kill myself there, and started to actively try to get better

I got on some medicine and it was helping a little bit, but I moved states (for college) and I haven't been able to see a new psychiatrist so I've been out of meds for a couple months. I'm also terrified of going to the new doctor because I want to lose weight before I go. I don't want to be introduced to my psychiatrist as a fatty. I can tell already that I'm severely depressed, which I'm so fucking familiar with that I can handle it.

Two things are worrying me though. First off, for the first time since I'm starting to see things. I keep thinking I see/hear things that I know aren't there. I'm seeing people and not just shadows, but fully formed nightmare things. In class, in the window, in the shower. I'm always on edge, wondering when the next thing is gonna show up. And I swear I'm hearing animal noises and grunts and stuff.

Second of all, tonight I actually said out loud, for the first time since 2015, that I wanted to kill myself. I honestly don't think I ever got over passively wanting to die but I haven't thought or said that I actively wanted to make an attempt on my life since I was 16. And I just said it. I don't mean it, or at least I think I don't mean it right now.

Basically, I'm just at a loss right now. I'm terrified to go to the doctor and be branded as a fat ass (2014/2015ish I struggled with anorexia) but I also know that there's a possibility of severe relapse if I don't take care of this.

I'm just so scared and empty. I don't know what to do.",14Feb2019,1
80,"I already know I've had depression, and as an adult I've been seeing therapists/psychiatrists. I had a traumatic/abusive childhood: violently attacked, nearly murdered, raped at a young age, raped again when I was older, psychotic parent. I spent over half my life self harming (but not anymore!) I was ""homeschooled"" (no education or going outside and I highly discouraged to interact with anybody but the psychotic parent) until high school so I reeeally missed out on a lot of healthy emotional development and socialization, and a I've made a lot of progress! But socializing is still sometimes extremely difficult for me: I never feel like I fit in anywhere, and it's extremely difficult to relate to anybody, and sometimes the thought of approching a stranger (or sometimes a close friend!) sends me into extreme panic attacks that freak other people out, but I'm just sobbing my face off telling them, ""No, it's okay, really! This happens all the time!"" because I'm used to them but that still doesn't stop the overwhelming feelings of fear and guilt ect, and it definitely doesn't comfort the new friend or passing stranger. 

I have had many jobs, and none of them for very long. My longest job run was a year and a half at a fast-food chain and one day instead of going to work -- a thought which filled me with absolute dread -- I instead tried to kill myself. I was hospitalized for a bit, and uh, didn't go back to work for awhile after that. Since then I haven't lasted two months anywhere before I give up or am fired for sucking at my job. 

I very barely made it out of high school, I have been trying college ever since but my anxiety and fear and self loathing end up getting the better of me and I drop out/fail, sometimes right at the beginning, middle, or right at the end. 

You can imagine that at several of these points people have told me I can do it, I'm smart enough, I'm capable enough, I just need to try a little bit harder!! 

But it's starting to occur to me if that is really the case? I feel like I've tried as hard as I can, multiple times! And I've never actually done anything to demonstrate my intelligence: I can't solve puzzles, I don't notice patterns, and the only games I am good at are one player repetitive, extremely simple ones, that everybody else gets bored of. In fact, I often get in trouble in social situations because I keep doing the same thing over and over again -- I don't get bored or annoyed at stupid shit that seems to annoy or bother other people! Things like continuing a joke, or things like that. I never mean to insult somebody or bother them but people very often have to tell me when to stop. 

But despite this people are often drawn to me, not neccisarily in a romantic way, and especially people who are clearly mentally unstable (like the loon on the train or bus). One thing I've heard over and over again is that I'm a ""deep thinker"" or ""creative genius"" but I really doubt this. For one, just because I'm not saying anything doesn't mean I'm thinking of anything profound or intelligent: most of the time I'm struggling to follow what you're saying and how it relates to the rest of the conversation or anything else that's happening (and I often can't find the answer, I just accept that's a thing you said, and I don't understand it, but let's move on, anyways!). And I think people think I'm so ""creative"" because drawing is the ONE thing I'm actually good at, and I'm not even that great? I'm just better than most people who don't draw? And it's not even ""drawing from my mind"" stuff, I do life drawing, portraits, or just copy other peoples ideas. 

I've gotten the question, ""Are you autistic?"" more than once. And I can't honestly say no, either, because I don't know! I can just say I was never diagnosed. 

I also can't judge people very well, I repeatedly make bad desicions, I haven't been able to live on my own because the stress of things like ""laundry"" and ""buying grocceries"" are sometimes too much for me, sometimes I don't leave my appartment for days. I currently have no job and my family supports me, trusting this is just a rough patch and I'll make it soon! 

If I was ugly or had an annoying voice I think people would have noticed these traits of mine, but I'm kind of attractive and (due to a speech problem I had as a kid -- by the way, I had trouble speaking as a kid!!) when I'm super nervous around people I slur and stutter in a way that make people think I have some sort of European accent.

And then my good parent and siblings are all actually really smart, people say so all the time! And they have degrees, and stuff! And I sure think they're really smart, but idk, maybe they're just average and I am actually disabled mentally and/or emotionally? 

TLDR; I've always thought like I didn't fit in and I just need to try harder but what if I'm actually disabled but nobody has noticed because I'm cute and talk funny?

83,"NSFW: Masturbation, Cutting

Background: I had a girlfriend, we broke up a year and a couple weeks ago. I had liked her alot, loved her even. She didn't feel the same way. Generally I have been what I think is a kinder person, we had talked an she had an issue with cutting, and I had an issue with masturbation. we both promised each other that we would quit these habits. for a while I thought it was working. I had felt so tied up in being nice to people, trying to always act good and right to please people, but at night when there was no one to please, I would take to pleasing myself. I felt shame about it immediately afterwards, I knew that I didn't want people to the things I felt attracted to, and I also felt trapped in not being able to have these attractions and be entirely satisfied with myself. When I had started dating this girl, and progressed into the period where I believed her cutting had stopped, I noticed my inner urges I had been trying to suppress started to get the best of me. When we would meet for a date or to hang out, she would insist she had stopped cutting, but I knew it was a lie, I would find razors in her drawer in her bedroom (I promise i'm not invading on her privacy, I had stumbled across them while looking for something else), or I would find lacerations on her wrist that weren't there, she would try and make them look scared over with makeup or something, and I would brownish red stains on her sleeves when I would do our laundry. part of me figured if she was going to lie, I could too. In essence I started lying because she would treat herself in such a terrible way. I started saying fucked up things, I started to tell her she would feel better if she would commit herself more to me, if she had sex with me, if she pleased this inner self I had. I asked her to do somethings she wasn't ready for. She pushed me away, and rightfully so, I was a horrible person for doing what I had asked to do, at such a shitty time.

I told her, ""because if they can't keep up they need to get out of my way. Because I don't care who I have to step on, who I have to destroy, to get ahead. That I be the best I can be and be better than anyone, and if they can't handle that, to get out.""

That was her aha moment. But it's more than that. I genuinely don't like anyone, or rather I reserve my like for certain people. And that's not many. I don't have what you'd call normal morals. Andrew Ryan from Bioshock had the best idea, to create a place free of all those moral constraints that prevent progress. That maybe Comstock had the right idea about cleansing the world. I am not a good person. 

When someone shows me a picture of something tragic that has happened? I feel nothing. A natural disaster occurs, I think of how I can benefit from it. All that matters to me is profit, and how best to get it, even if it means watching others suffer for it. I feel nothing.

But yet for her? I actually care about her. I never speak or do anything without reason. And yet I love her and don't know why. It pisses me off to no end.

This world is full of monsters, they just try to hide it. I however embrace it. I recognize it as a human's true nature and don't hide from it.

What I don't understand? Is why.

**tl;dr** I'm a bad guy and don't know why.

90,"This is not a joke, I have looked for answers everywhere but nobody could give me an answer to my problem. This post may be uncomfortable to read for some people. It includes drugs, terrible desires and some traumatic stuff. Some violent things too, maybe? I am writing this in a frenzy so don't mind my grammars and such. Also keep in mind that I am an Asian teenager, so things may differ... culture-wise.

I always wanted to torture things as a child. I mean, I didn't want to hurt anything actually alive and intelligent, so I would fantasize about killing anything from a children's book. Like, baby dragons or such imaginary but weak, cute, cuddly things. I really would sit there for at least more than 40 minutes at a time, ripping their limbs out and stomping on them and I loved it. I think I was five or something, definitely old enough to read. I would draw pictures that had stories to them, stories that would have a main character and such, just to kill every main character and some side characters, too. It's better if they have a whole storyline and they just die, you know. I don't know, but I was a sweet child. Very hyper, but sweet. I used to be quiet and way too sensitive around the age I learned how to talk, and I sat in one seating with my knees together and my hands placed on them(mom told me this with some photos and man I looked so creepy). Ma decided that this wasn't going to do me any good so she took me to the playground every day which made me super fuckin hyper... I guess. I had a hobby of gathering dead animals and dissecting them to study them but I don't feel like that was a bad thing. I sewed them back together and would say sorry and everything. I was that nice to animals and moreover, people. I told you about my childhood for a reason that will be valid later on.

Then, I obviously became a teenager. I was bullied several times in elementary school, but nothing bothered me except for the last year of elementary school in which I was bullied by two teachers for a whole year and I got pretty depressed by it. I stopped sleeping and I cried every day, blah blah blah. As I said, I'm Asian, and my mom was a strict person. Not just strict, she straight up hit me and shouted mean things at me, so that totally didn't help. Then we had a car accident and mom and I got real fucked up, so mom, with her body hurting so much, had to take it out on me. By the time I was in middle school, shit got even worse. When I was 14, my mom hit me every day and said things like I disgusted her and she would love to grind my face up in the asphalt and shit, yeah? That got me real depressed and I wouldn't even cut myself cos that's too delicate for me, so I would just punch my own jaw or stomach and scratch and bite myself, bang my head on the furniture and well, you get it. Then high school came, which was a boarding school. I got away from mom and we had time to talk about shit so we got way better. I've always loved mom, always will.

Though... one problem. I got so bored that I decided to try just two pills from my secret stash that I somehow gathered up to kill myself with in middle school, right? Well that was real fun but it triggered some kind of bullshit in my brain and I had to suffer from mental illness for three weeks. Three weeks seem short, but not when you're a psycho. I heard things, saw things, couldn't make sense and couldn't remember anything. Of course my grades crashed that semester. Anyways that went away but one symptom didn't leave. I really want to hurt people. I really really really do but I have such amazing self control that I really haven't hurt anything yet. Yeah I punched like, five mirrors and broke three, gently stabbed myself while high(I'm never doing that ever again: I wrecked the bathroom door, my mattress, stabbed the wall and my mirror and some postcards in my dorm room) but I didn't hurt anyone else. I love animals and ew, I don't want to torture animals. I want people. Someone pisses me off, I go real cold. I'm never heated angry. I'm hyper, so it might seem like I'm angry and fuming, but not really. When I get bored, I have this strong urge to get into a fight. Whenever I almost get into a fight, I feel thrilled at the thought of punching someone. Anger is a far weaker weapon than whatever I feel(probably amusement and thrill and I am so so sorry but some arousal). I love having physical/psychological power over people. I am not a bully, I have great friends and I'm a bit edgy but I am also a nice friend, you know? I look so normal yet I need to annihilate someone. I know that doing so won't help me so I really pay attention to NOT doing it but I'm going mad over this. It's like eating hot fudge chocolate cake for an hour without resting but never getting to drink a cold glass of milk. You really really want that glass of milk and you can get it anytime you want, but you can't cos it'll ruin your life. I want to kill people with knives, I want blood, I want fear in someone's eyes but I'm not gonna do it, but I want it so bad. And nobody ever gets me.

I know that seeing a psychiatrist is the best option, but I can't. I'm already seeing one but mom's heavily involved and I can't do that to her. Also, there's some kind of insurance thing going on and I really can't just ruin that and say ""I think I'm bonkers crazy and I want blood"". Also, I don't feel like I would be seen as a trustworthy individual after telling the psychiatrist about this. I really really can't go see one even if I wanted to. What I want to know is how to get rid of this desire. It's real bad and I need help. What the hell should I do? I'm so alone on this. I don't want to hurt anybody, really. I'm doing a real great job on not doing as I desire, just help me on getting rid of this longing, please.",14Feb2019,1

94,"I, 19 f, have coped with almost every difficultly or bumpy road by lashing out. I had a rough relationship with both my parents due to one have strong involvement with drugs and the other favoring a relationship over my brother and i. 

The parent who did drugs had abandoned me as a kid because they had struggled to even stay around when they had the chance too. It was a life that they began to choose over their two kids. I did not yet understand this as a kid but as I would grow older I would question why I was not good enough to have that parent stick around. Now, I am okay with that parent but we have more of a friendship bond than anything. I do not enjoy their presence because I am often criticized due to their belief that I am not apart of my families culture and that I am too cheap and my anger problems.

The other parent I had loved, adored, and saw as my hero as he did swoop in and come save my brother and I. I would soon come to know that this parent is highly abusive and it killed me. I never took that many beating due to my older brother defending me. I grew to be scared of the person who I thought was saving me. He always told my brother and I he could never just be happy with us, he needed someone else to satisfy him. I understand that now but as a kid I took it as I could not be enough for my own father. Living in that household I felt tense

Going on 14 on my birthday I was molested by a family member and I never coped with it. I tried so hard to forget it despite me confessing everything and getting him in prison. I had sadly not been his only victim, just the last victim because i put an end to him. To avoid the truth of what happened I decided that I would self harm and try to end my life. 

I now live somewhere away from both parents but I live with a hardcore drug addict and it kills me every day.

I have had all these issues, NEVER coped with them. Things still hurt me to this day, like an open wound. Whenever anything slightly of inconvenience occurs I blow up and begin having a panic attack where I begin to self harm. I am very unattached to others and I cannot keep friendships or relationships due to my lack of sympathy or empathy for others. I need help but I do not know where to start.

Today I was keeping myself busy, my fiance was at work. He got the day off early, came to my house, dropped off a box of chocolates and left. (Not before asking for sex, of course....)

He refused to go out to dinner with me and has ignored my tests for the last few hours.

I have been thinking about checking myself in to the mental health ward for the last 2-3 weeks due to an incredibly large amount of deaths I've suffered in my family in the last month and a half and my feeling that I'm going to have a mental break. (I'm also currently going through exposure therapy for ptsd so that's not helping either.)

103,"Hi,

I’m currently extremely vulnerable emotionally and struggling to cope. I went to a&amp;e this morning feeling extremely unsafe and suicidal. I waited there, just wanting SOMEONE to talk to as I’m very isolated in my life and a lot of negative events have taken place over the last year. I waited for a few hours and someone finally came to see me from the community mental health team. I went in there and he sat me down and said ‘right, I’m usually brutally honest in these meetings because I’m not interested in wasting any time. What is it you want us to do?’ and I said that I wasn’t sure, that I’m really struggling at the moment and I just need someone to talk to and to support me. He responded to say that nobody has a magic wand that they can wave to make me stop being sad and I said that I know and that’s not what I’m looking for. He then said this AGAIN and then said what brought me here today? So I mentioned some brief details of what had happened and ended on a note of ‘and honestly, I just woke up feeling absolutely awful and I didn’t know what to do’ and he responded saying ‘well what you should do is just cope with things in a normal way when they go wrong instead of doing this’ (I literally hadn’t self harmed or attempted suicide, I just went there because I felt I had nowhere else to go and I felt suicidal). I responded that I know but I can’t help it at the moment which is why I’m looking for help. He said the line again about nobody having a magic wand and I just stood up, told him I don’t want his help if he’s going to be really condescending about it and walked out of the hospital where I then wandered around town for about an hour before my ex came and picked me up and brought me home where he is currently like watching my every move because unsurprisingly, I feel even worse. 

Why do people always treat people who are mentally ill in this way? I wasn’t looking for attention, I was looking for HELP. I’m not an idiot, or a crazy out-of-control person and if he had just listened to my current circumstances he would have understood why I was feeling so awful and needed someone to support me. Instead, he basically said there’s nothing they can do and I need to just stop being so ‘dramatic’ every time something stressful happens in my life.

I have been self harm free for years, coped very well by myself but recently had a series of extremely stressful events pile up on top of each other and not been able to get support as I am very isolated. I am not dramatic, I am a person with an illness who needed some help with that illness, not someone to tell me while I’m experiencing a crisis that I just need to ‘stop being like this’.

I pretend I’m chill with going about on my own and talking to random people but I honestly can’t trust them, whenever people get close I tend to sabotage the relationship (whether it be friendship or love life) and back away. I’ve known this was the case since high school ended (I’m in uni now) and can’t seem to shift it.

But instead, I ordered a sandwich and salad, and sat down and ate IN THE RESTAURANT! I was fairly calm, and concentrated on my food and my phone to not be too self-aware.

120,"In her new bill (Washington SB 5842 2019) to legalize forced electro-shock on non-consenting psychiatric prisoners, Manka Dhingra claims that this is the definition of ECT:

 ""Electroconvulsant therapy"" means a class of procedures performed under general anesthesia in which small electrical currents are passed through the brain, **stimulating changes in brain chemistry which can quickly reverse symptoms of certain mental health conditions** including, but not limited to, severe depression, treatment-resistant depression, severe mania, catatonia, and agitation and aggression in persons with dementia.:

1) Of course brain-damaging people reduces agitation and aggression. It reduces ALL brain function, permanently. 

2) She totally forgets to mention that **the ""small"" electrical currents INDUCE A GRAND MAL SEIZURE**, and that the prisoner has to be sedated and restrained to prevent his teeth and bones from breaking. 

3) Changes in brain chemistry? HUH? **Electro-shock does not change brain chemistry**. It changes the PHYSICAL brain architecture by **SEVERING CORTICAL CONNECTIVITY**.

I’m going to keep it short and simple.
-I have depression and bulimia (6+ yrs)
-My younger sister has bulimia
No one in my family knows about my problems, and no one besides me knows about my sister’s. She’s pretty popular and social in college (I’m not. Pretty introverted) but comes home about once every other week to feed her b/p cycle. I have told my mom exactly once about my sisters bikinis before but whether she chose to forget it or is in denial, I don’t know. But my parents are not good at expressing affection and the only way my mom knows how is by feeding us. So she’s constantly bringing home junk after junk by the bulk, which makes it very hard for me or my sister to stop. 

Every time my sisters tells my parents that she’s going to come home for the weekend, my heart drops. Because my parents are happy about it but I know the real reason why she’s coming. I’ve confronted her before about it, but obvs nothing has really changed. And I can’t help but sound angry when I bring the topic up. I’m angry because I feel guilty and partially responsible. I wonder, did my binging somehow influence her? I don’t know if she knows about my ed, but did she somehow find out and copy my behavior? I’m afraid to ask, because if it’s true, I will be absolutely crushed. And if it’s not..well now she would know (and oh god, I can’t have that happen.)

I feel lonely. I have friends, but they’re all busy with their lives and I don’t want to burden them with my problems.

I have really bad mood swings. I feel depressed asf and suicidal one moment but completely happy the next (albeit for a shorter period of time.) I don’t know why, but I always feel extremely irritated and angry around my parents. I want to scream and yell at them, but I know that’s clearly a bad thing, so i surprise my urges by not saying anything. But they take this as me being cold and distant. I hate how that makes me feel.

I feel so insecure. I feel ugly and worthless. I know it’s irrational to feel this way but I just feel so drained. I try to be happy, and sometimes even believe that I’m pretty but then I look in a mirror or a photo of myself and my stomach drops. 

I put on a front that I’m ok. But I’m not. I’m tearing up at work rn, trying to look normal, but I feel like I’m just throwing on band aids on an opening gash. I’m scared to tell my parents about my depression. What can they do about it? Being Asian, mental health is not really something they know much about. I just want to get away.

136,"I'm a male, 38 from Sheffield in England and have suffered with chronic long term anxiety, loneliness and depression for over 15 years. I've lived on my own since I was 23 and have always had trouble finding and maintaining friendships and relationships. I've gone from one thing to another with people over the years, a lot down to me and a lot down to them, I've punished myself and I've hurt other people, I've owned my guilt and pain and mistakes for years but refused to believe that other people have done the same. I've gone from having stable employment, friends and relationships, being at the top of a mountain but crashing and burning in a shory space of time, meaning being made redundant, losing a partner, losing friends, losing opportunities etcetera to having serious depression and wanting to kill myself over and over. This all happened around 2008 and I've struggled to pick up the pieces since, never found stable work only volunteer jobs, struggled finding stable friendships and activities that worked meaning keeping up with things instead of things being a flash in the pan. All this time I've lived alone and suffered alone through all of it. I moved a few years ago from Hackenthorpe to Park Hill but found it even more difficult being in a block of flats surrounding by people but feeling more isolated and alone. I've tried making my place nice and making a new start, tried to turn things around but get sucked back to that negative and lonely cycle. 

Tried to reach out but it's like being in space and you're in a void with nothing biting in return, even when I have met people and done things nothing becomes permanent it's like walking on thin ice, you're ok for while but you know things won't stay that way for long and they inevitably don't.

139,"Hi. Sorry for the (very) very long post, I'm more writing this to vent and say all of this to myself than for anything else. And sorry for the bad English, I'm French.

&amp;#x200B;

I've always been weird. Not very social as a kid, with hyper-sensibilities to noise and taste making everything very hard. Stuck with a hyper-selective food list (I've only eaten 4 different things for my dinners since I was 5, I don't eat meal, fish, vegetable or fruit), it went from ""weird but it works"" to ""awful"" when I was a teenager. I was send to see doctors as a child (I wasn't very social with other children), with no diagnostic in particular (but ""therapy"" for sensory and social issues, plus help because I walked and moved weirdly). As a teen, I got diagnosed with ""teenager's depression"", ""school phobia"" and ""social phobia"", and saw a psychologist for a long time, with progress but no real cure. When I was 19, we saw a documentary on autism and Asperger syndrome in particular, it left me out thinking ""this is me, but worse"", my mother also felt it, so we started to dig a little bit and the more we found the more it made sense... so we looked in that direction, sadly France has been stuck in the 70s when it comes to autism so between the time it took me to fill the papers and the wait... five years latter, here we are, currently going through the tests.

&amp;#x200B;

During this time, I've been ""fine"", mentally. Not wanting to die, not really desiring to live either. Have a very hard time leaving the house, don't have a job (nor a life, really), get easily scared by noise, am anxious all the time, not really happy, sad a lot of the time... with sudden burst of interest for a random thing here and there and phases of nothingness in between, but compared to the teens years, I was ""fine"". I left school without a diploma, I didn't have the strength to go to the end and since then I've had the little voice in the back of my head saying ""you know what, had you really desired to do it, you'll have done it"" and ""you're feeling bad, but if you really wanted to change, you'll do it"". We have an old saying here, ""who wants can"", something like that, and this has been going in loops in my head for years now : yes I'm depressed, yes I'm always scared, yes I'm stuck in my life but if, just if... I could do it. It's not like I'm in a wheelchair or something like that, physically I can, so why wouldn't I be able to do it ? 

I searched the symptom of depression online, out of curiosity : ""feeling of sadness or emptyness every day"", check. ""lack of interest"", most of the time, check. ""weight change"", I've been overweight for my entire life, so not check. ""sleep issue"", well also since forever so not check. ""body slowing down"", my stomach's been giving me issue for years, check. ""tiredness"", check. ""feeling of being guilty, or hating oneself"", check. ""cognitive issues"", check, there's things that were there before my teen years, others that weren't. ""desire to commit suicide"", not check, not anymore. That's 6 out of 9. Since I've read those a year or two ago, I've said that I am depressive, but it was just that, a word. At the end of the day, I still thought ""I'm a parasite who lacks the necessary will to change my life, if I found that will, I'll change in no time"". That was before the tests.

The autism tests are very painful. I didn't realize how weird I am. I learned that my father attempted suicide as a teen, that was hard to swallow. I learned that my tone of voice and facial expression are abnormal. I learned that a crap ton of things I do aren't ""how normal humans do it"", even if I've been normalizing slowly but surely. It has been a long series of punches, left right and center, and my head has a hard time dealing will of these.

This made me stupidly anxious. Normally I can hide it, or deal with it, but now... it was to the point where I wanted to vomit all the time and couldn't do anything because of it. Something inside of me broke. I really want to go forward, but I can't. This time, the will is there, the desire is there, the head is convinced, there's no more little thought of ""this life isn't that bad"" or ""well, post-cure me might be worse"", no, this time I want to change... but my body says no.

For the first time of my life, on Thursday, I went to see my doctor (generalist doctor), the one that has been seeing me since I've been a child, the one that has been asking me if I'm happy or if my head is okay each time she saw me for years. Obviously, every time, I lied. This time I didn't. I asked for help. She gave me pills for the anxiety and against depression. I've never accepted treatment before, I've never asked a doctor for help before. I've always said ""I'll get through it, alone"", I just don't think that's possible anymore. The anti-depression pill has yet to do anything, I've read this one takes time, on the other side, my body had a little bit of a hard time getting used to the anti-anxiety pill (I felt very sleepy Thursday, yesterday was a little bit better, today it's more manageable) but I feel so much better thanks to it, I didn't expect it to be that big of a change... 

I've sent a mail to a psychologist recommended by an autistic NGO, telling her that I don't have a diagnosis but I don't know if it matters or not (it did to me, before, it was an excuse to not contact her, it doesn't anymore) she can't take me, she already has too much patients, she gave me the mail of another psychologist, I've contacted her, she's yet to answer.

I'm scared. For years I've been disgusted by myself and felt awful, but below all of that, there was this quasi-religious belief in my capacities and in the fact that nothing could stop me if I fully decided to do something and now... I don't know. I've tried to help myself so many time, failed every single time, I don't know if this time I'll manage to do it. I feel weak and beaten down.

The psychologist that made me pass the IQ test (high functioning autism looks a lot like very-high IQ) also took the time to talk about me and my situation in general. She talked about the fact that there's a point, in mental health issues, at which going to a psychiatric hospital may be the solution and maybe I'm at that point. I refused this, I just crawled into my little psychological fortress and screamed on the inside. On the outside, I just smiled and made jokes and... I don't know, tried to change the topic. The more days pass, the more I think about this, the less my arguments seem to make sense to me, the more I ask myself ""what if she's right ?"", ""could I really cure myself only with the help of a doctor, or is it bad enough for the simple solution to not be enough ?"".

I'm scared. I'm stupidly scared. I hate change, I hate the unknown, and this is both a literal life-change (I didn't understand why so many people talked about this as a ""second birth"", now I do) and a jump in the unknown. I still have something like a month to a month and a half before the tests are done and I get the final slap on the face of the result of the tests. I'll probably get my first rendez-vous with the psychologist before that. My logical brain wants to go through it, sincerely. My emotional brain is panicked and just wants to crawl back in a corner and wait for the heat death of the universe. For years, my logical brain had no power whatsoever, now it seems to be different, but I don't know how long that will last, I don't know if it'll last long enough for me to save myself.

I don't know what is ""me"", I don't know who is ""me"". I don't know what would go away if I were to get cured, I don't know what would stay. I don't know who that guy post-cure will be, what his life will be. I don't know if my friend would like him, I don't know if my family would love him. I don't know if this is worth it, I just know it's going to be very long and painful. I'm just... very scared. Very very scared. ",14Feb2019,1

141,"I hid it so well, and though I'm better now (except for anxiety) it feels like since no one really knew, it never happened. I am more able to talk about it now but I'm finding no one's taking it seriously. I was extremely depressed with a lot of anxiety essentially due to being undiagnosed autistic (stop reading if you don't want to hear about self harm). I first hurt myself when I was 12, with my nails and tacks. I picked at my skin so there were scars all over my face, I remember an adult noticed but just kind of gave me a weird look. I did a lot of obsessive picking, there are still scars all over my legs and chest from that. No one noticed, a doctor saw one part and kind of joked about it being ""nerves"". I also cut myself... extensively. I didn't even realize how bad it was, it became normal to me. But I was terrified of what would happen if anyone found out, if I would be locked up against my will or something. And simply that it was ""bad"". There are scars literally all over my legs, many deep enough that there's no feeling or hair growth. I wanted to die and didn't even care, so I wouldn't attempt to clean them or seal them shut. I was still a stupid young teen so I got blood on my pajama pants a lot, even though I wasn't the one who did laundry that wasn't caught either. I knew it would be suspicious to use too many bandaids so at some points my legs were all taped up with regular tape. I'm amazed I didn't get infections. I had trouble verbalizing my thoughts/feelings anyway and was terrified of doctors, so when my mom took me due to what she thought was just anxiety the doctors just kind of gave up because I wouldn't ""open up"" as they put it.

I had no friends and everything was just blamed as my fault, like my choice to be ""difficult"" or moody.   I was 23 before I was able to really talk to doctors or about my feelings at all. The first therapist brought up the classic using a rubber band on my wrist as a distraction... which kind of seems like a joke. Now that I'm an adult I get blamed for not knowing how to fix my mental issues myself, I was told by my mom that I ""really need to learn how to deal with your anxiety"".

146,So I’ve basically been in this constant state of super super sadness for about 13 years I’m 25 now has anyone ever got out of it and stayed out ,14Feb2019,1
147,"Just some context before I start this:  
I was diagnosed with manic depression type 2 almost exactly a year ago. Although I'm still in the process in finding the right dosage and its volumes with the help of my psychiatrist, I still suffer from certain symptoms such as depressive phases and phases of irritability and hyper-activity. I've tried a wide spectrum of anti-depressants in order to help with my mood disorder, but I've experienced a lot of odd and inconvenient symptoms with each of them, eg. extremely restless legs, extreme lethargy, and increased thoughts of suicide.  


This isn't a throwaway account, because I don't feel like I should hide what I'm feeling right now.  


I've been experiencing a lot of turbulence in my life the past month or so. From severe dysfunctional events within my family, to losing my friends, and a severe change of routine as I've transitioned from undergrad to honours. Personally, I don't feel like any of these aspects should have led to what I feel like now, but it is the only factors that I can attribute my current mindset to.  


I'm not a person to share my feelings with. I've only got my boyfriend to do so with. I used to have friends with which I could share my issues with and have them do the same, but we've separated due to the different academic paths we've chosen to take. I know it seems unfair, but my only option left is my boyfriend. I don't believe that he should carry the responsibility of helping me with my (sort of unfix-able) mental problems. I would see my psychiatrist more often, but I neither have the time nor money to do so.  


Therefore, I usually try to tend to my issues alone. They're burdensome, and my boyfriend isn't the best at comforting. (He's the type of person that wants to fix a problem when you just want to be heard and understood. I've told- kindly- a lot of times that I actually have thought of ways to fix my problems and that I really just need him to listen. His response has always been that that is just the way he was raised to comfort people). Furthermore, he has been experiencing some issues at work as well.  


Today, a particularly stressful event unfolded at his work. I comforted him as much as I could over text. He seems to prefer being given advice as opposed to being listened to (in a sense). I did so far into a lecture until I was reprimanded by my professor for being on my phone during class. I had to stop there.  


Fast forward to the afternoon: He's feeling ambivalent about life where I've been constantly empathizing with him and his situation. Keep in mind, I've been in the mental state where nothing truly brings me any happiness. It's not his fault, but the entire situation just... made me snap. I knew then that I wasn't ok anymore.  


When I got home, I just had a complete mental breakdown. I really hoped that he would come and visit me. It was selfish of me to hope so, as we live about 30 minutes away from each other. But I truly needed it. He didn't.  


That was fine, though. I understood why he wouldn't. We usually play games together at night (he has a job), and I told him that we could at least talk over voice chat while playing divinity or something. He didn't. That hurt me really badly, and I freaked out on him, telling him that I just wanted some sort of affection and care. Not because it's valentine's day, but just because I can't anymore. He said that he didn't know how to respond and has gone to bed. My messages to him weren't kind, so I understand why he would do so.  


I just feel so broken and abandoned right now. I've been feeling really numb for a while and was so desperately hoping for a breakdown so that I could at least feel something again, and now it's just made everything worse. I don't have any friends to confide in anymore, I've never been close to my family, and now I've pushed away the one person that would listen to me and at least try to support me.  


I know this is so stupid but I really just need someone to help me right now.",14Feb2019,1

I honestly cant even tell if I am actually depressed or bored. Is this my ocd telling me I am depressed or am I really depressed? I went from feeling okay to suddenly feeling super low to the point where my boyfriend surprising me with flowers and shit doesn’t even make me smile. Its all forced.

150,"I'm a fifteen year old girl who suffers from depression, anxiety, ADHD, and a few other mental illnesses. I've been going to therapy since I was in first grade and I haven't made any progress. It's been 8 fucking years and like at least 10 different therapists and nothing works. I'm trying to tell me mom that it's not working and that we are wasting my money, but everytime I say that she's like ""maybe you can talk to your therapist and come up with ideas to make it work"". I've literally hate therapy and every week I cry right before. You literally go in and do nothing and waste your money and it makes you more depressed. I've had no friends since kindergarten (which my mom reminds of constantly telling me that if I don't have friends by now I don't deserve any). My depression hit a maximum last year, but I will admit my anxiety is less but that's just from the meds. Can someone please help me convince my mom that therapy isn't helping me. It makes me so upset and she's so pushy for it when it literally makes everything so much worse. I usually cry on the way there and then spend a few hours crying after the session, but she's all like ""maybe you need to give it a chance. Be more open, me more assertive"".

151,"Do you think my partner could have clinical depression?

My male partner is 23 and is a very pessimistic person, and I don’t really mind usually because I can be pessimistic too. But my partner talks negatively about every single thing that isn’t games and is stressed out about life 24/7 even when he is having actually playing games. At first I thought it was a temporary thing, but if i think about it, he’s been complaining everyday about basic stuff since i’ve known him for the last 3 years. He can’t handle any stress at all. That includes stress from work, stress from paying bills and stress from commuting to and from work.  To me, those are things that everyone has to experience, and they will never cease to exist unless you move to the forest and live off the land. But he talks about these things everyday in a way that suggests that life is dealing him a hard blow when I think that we have an normal amount of every day stress. This affects his sleep every night, and his energy is constantly low. I try to ask him to find some techniques to deal with the stress but he says that his stress is what keeps him from becoming a failure so he denies that it’s bad that he stresses about everything. He says that a counsellor could not help him. I doubt he will go to one, even if he knows he needs one.

We are moving out of our current living environment, mainly because it has such a bad effect on his mental health. So I have been doing ALL of the apartment hunting on my own because he can barely handle stress from work and from our current bad living environment which consists of aggressive housemates. But every time I find a place that suits his and my needs and is in our agreed price range, he freaks out about spending the money and about the move, even though i’m the one doing all the work for the move so far. He constantly complains about our current living situation, but also complains about moving even though that would have a positive affect on his mental health after the move. It’s like he can’t see anything positive about anything. 

If I could describe his condition it would be ‘constantly stressed and unable to handle the stress” 

Any thoughts?

153,"I don't know if this is a normal thing or what, but I just feel like nobody except maybe my family cares for me. I will disclose that I am a teenager and I know that we tend to go through mood swings and this might just be normal but, I feel like I have nobody that would notice since I'm always the one who carries conversations whenever I talk to people. I tried talking to many people, but nobody seems to want to talk to me. The only times people approach me is when they need something from me or when they want to tell me something. I know my teachers might notice, but they're paid to, it's their moral and legal responsibility to care for us. I am an atheist and don't believe in any afterlife which is one of the things that normally keep me from wanting to do this, but I feel so detached from reality and from life that, what would really be the difference. I don't know anymore. Is this normal? A few of my peers claim to have depression, but I'm not sure if this is just me being subconsciously edgy or what.

154,"Is it possible to have such ""repressed memories"" ? or am I just having some sort of false memory?     

Last week, I was in a party and got pretty drunk. Later that night when I got back in my apartment, I was messing around in my room and I found my old diary. I remember reading it but I don't remember the contents. Next morning, I woke up with a headache and when having a lots of morning coffee, I started reading the contents of said diary. There were lots of bad poetry and love letters but reading through my daily logs, I found out that around 5 years ago I was having suicidal thoughts and I even bought a bottle of pesticide and hid it under my bed. The weird part was I had no recollection of such event until I read my own diary. After reading that, it all started to come back to me. I threw away pesticide later but at that time I was was having suicidal thoughts. 

My life at that time was going downhill academically and personally. I was just a teenager starting college and most of the time I was either high or drunk with my friends. Mostly high. I used to have minimal social interactions with other people. My family were away and I used to meet and talk with them once a month. As I read through my diary, I think all of those factors must have contributed to my depression but it just didn't make sense. I remember all that stuff, being high and drunk and failing classes but had no recollection of suicidal thoughts. Weird.    

Later I cleaned up my act and improved my grades. I am now at a graduate school of a prestigious university. I am doing research on the discipline I love. I got fantastic relationship with my family, friends and colleagues. But, after reading my diary I am thinking about my past a lot. Before it becomes a huge issue, I figured I need to address this fast. Hence this rant.     

Anyone got similar stories or anyone got some articles, literature I can read related to this issue? Thank you.",14Feb2019,1
155,"I don't really like who I am. I want to be skinnier and ""better"". 

I have started to eat less because I want to be skinnier (just to clarify I'm not anorexic and I never go to bed hungry, I just eat less food then I did before). I weigh 80-81kg and I'm 185-186 (~176-178 lbs and ~6,06-6,1 feet) which means I do have a healthy weight according to my hight. 
But I still want to be skinnier.

When I look at myself I don't see myself as an ugly 17 year old boy. I see myself as average looking but with a lot of things to improve (how I act, personality and how I look among others).

I also dislikes that I'm as introverted as I am. I am guarded, I don't really speak much and I want to be more social and ""out there"".
I often let people talk over me because ""what I wanted to say wasn't that important"" or ""they wouldn't care eather way"". If you say something the same time as me, I'm the one who stops talking first. 
I hate that, but I can't really stop doing it. 

I also don't know to whom I should turn to. I don't want to turn to a psychologist, teacher, friend or anyone in my family because they will look at me differently (and if I go to a psychologist my parents/brother/friends might find out and will look at me differently, I also don't feel like the way I look at myself is bad enough to talk to a psychologist about). 

The main reason why I even can let my guard down and talk about my problems here are because of the anonymity online. 
It makes be able to tell you because you don't know who I really am. 
But I'm not going to lie, I do think it is hard to even tell you people, even if you don't  know who I am ""behind the screen"". 

I do want to tell someone about this, but I don't want somebody to know. I want someone to listen, but I dont want anyone's help.

I just dont want anyone to look at me differently, but I know that I need to say something. ",14Feb2019,1
156,"First of all I just want to say that I'm not suicidal or anything like that.  
I'm 19 years old and have been battling my mental health since I was 12 years old which has gradually gotten worse. I've recently been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and afterwards ADHD (in the last month) and have been told again for the third time that I don't seem to be suffering from any depression disorders. SERIOUSLY. In the past I have been extremely suicidal but I won't get into any of that. My problem now is being told I can't get therapy because there are no free counselling for ADHD in adults, just for kids. And since being diagnosed with ADHD my anxiety disorder is looked at as an extension of ADHD and not a separate issue. I can't afford therapy either so that's sort of shit but I never liked going anyway because of the constant almost misdiagnosing and being told things I already know/told I don't have a problem when clearly I do.   
 My ""depression"" isn't as bad as it was, I don't feel sad I just feel completely numb all the time and feel like I don't really care about anything and since seeing my new therapist roughly since November, I've had four jobs (the longest being three weeks) and am now on my fifth and I also dropped out of my ""dream course"" in college. If that's not enough evidence I don't  know what to tell you. The numb feeling along with ADHD has made me a bit of an adrenaline junkie as well to the point where I cannot function without an adrenaline kick.  
 I've taken antidepressants (lexapro) but stopped taking it because it made me zone out and feel sick too much of the time. Normally I'd go to my friends for advice but right now everyone seems to be dealing with an awful lot as well as growing awfully apart since finishing school last year which has just made my anxiety worse. I'm not mad about it, life happens. I am having a hard time letting go though and accepting life happening. Especially considering everyones going off to college which makes me feel a bit left behind but I know I wouldn't be happy if I went back.   
I left college because of the anxiety of feeling depressed and not ""participating"" like everyone else, and also getting to know all these new people. Don't get me wrong I'm very sociable, I knew most people in my year after the first month of college because of my adhd anxiety cycle which makes me be sort of a class clown and like I don't have a single brain cell and I absolutely hate that part of myself which is why I had to get out of there.   
 I'm here because really I don't know where else to go, I'm completely sick of feeling like this and I'm ready to fight.   
I'm understanding now that most of the thoughts I have about myself are coming from this illness ie. ""I'm a bad person"". So I feel like that's one step out of the way. I was studying art because I'm a writer at heart but I want to illustrate my books. Since leaving college I haven't drawn or written a single thing due to lack of motivation.   
 I feel like it's worth noting since last month I've changed my diet completely for a more healthier diet and since starting my new job I've gotten a really good sleep pattern which I guess are two steps out of the way. I just want to keep things that way.

TL;DR   
I want my motivation back. I want to be nicer to people. I wan't to be ""myself"". Less anxious. Learn how to let go. And I also want to know if I should take Ritalin for my ADHD because I'm not sure if it will work well with everything else, (any similar experiences with that?).   
I would really appreciate any advice, I'm open to any suggestions.

**Some context:** 

I deal with fairly mild insomnia. For the past few weeks, I've been falling asleep around 4am and waking up around 9:00am. That's not the greatest amount of sleep, but I wouldn't say it's necessarily horrible. Not enough to feel like I'm literally dying.

No recreational drugs are involved, but I am on a small cocktail of medications that I feel might contribute to it. Part of me is wondering if it's anxiety.

I have quite a bit going on. The last time I spoke to my mother, around Thanksgiving, it was her telling me she had purposely overdosed on heroin and she was killing because her life was awful and she spent what was supposed to be the last hour of her life explaining that it was my fault for not sending her money or helping her get her own apartment. And maybe it was. But, she was addicted to opiods, living in a violent home with a coke addict boyfriend, and had just had that same coked up boyfriend text my grandparents telling them about how she sucks him off while he looks at pictures of my sister on Facebook. 

A very fucked up situation. I'd be an idiot to say that hasn't affected my mental state, but I go to psychiatrist and therapist which combined have kept me pretty stable, I think...

But here I am, feeling like I'm literally dying. Legitimately scared to the point where I almost call an ambulance.

**What happened last yesterday and last night:**

Yesterday was a pretty stressful day at work. The night prior, I had stayed up until 4:00am and woken up at 9:00, per usual as of late. Then, because of a production outage at work, I kept working from home until 10:00pm and the problem was eventually resolved. I was relatively happy, albeit emotionally exhausted.

Around 11:00am that morning, I took my usual medications.

* 60mg Cymbalta

* 150mg Lamotrigine

* 150mg Wellbutrin

* 10mg Adderal IR

* Additionally, I took 60mg Prednisone

The Prednisone is for sudden asymmetrical sensorineural hearing loss in my right ear as of 3 weeks ago. That was frightening, but I had an MRI and there was no tumor and no brain legions to indicate MS or stroke.

At the same time as taking my medicine I had an egg bagel with cheddar cheese and pastrami and a fairly large iced red eye coffee with 2 espresso shots. Really fucking good. Probably not the best to take with the prednisone and adderall though. That was a mistake, but just made me uncomfortable and eventually passed.

When I finished work around 10:00pm, I said good night to my girlfriend and played Apex Legends the rest of the night to unwind. Late night gaming isn't my usual, though. Normally it's netflix or some weeb shit.

When I realized how late it was, again, I went got up to go to bed and noticed my phone was nearly dead. Since I don't have a convenient plug near the bed, I got my super-fast charger and laid on the couch for about 30 minutes to get it high enough so I was confident my alarm would go off in the morning.

When I went to get up to go to bed, I found that I could barely move my fingers. My arms felt stiff like they were weighted down by some thick pudding. My head almost rolled off my shoulders and my vision seemed blurry. I got up to go to the bathroom and it seemed like there was a white haze over my vision. 

I brushed my teeth, went downstairs, crawled into bed, and accidentally woke my girlfriend up. I explained to her that I ""didn't"" feel good and was a little nervous. I fell asleep shortly thereafter.

I woke up fine.

---

I'm nervous something bigger might be wrong. I can't tell if it's the lack of sleep catching up to me, work stress, repressed depression by way of medications and simply bottling emotions, that I didn't eat enough yesterday, or if it's just a reaction to adding prednisone to my daily intake.

After writing that last paragraph, clearly I have some things to talk about at my next therapy visit haha. But, still, I don't feel like the issues are at the level they used to be and this feeling of almost-a-coma is relatively new.

This isn't the only time i had this lack of feelings many people that i loved(family, friends,) died and  i didn't feel a thing.
I don't remember the last time i was genuinaly happy or angry or sad or even felt what i had to.
 Of course i have moments that i could say I'm glad or upset, but that's it, it's almost like i shutdown my feelings.

Do i need to get help or it's just a fase of something.

170,"I've had depression for like around 8 years and I always had this problem of not being able to get myself to actually sit and study, or read, or watch a serie or anything, but I was going through school so I didn't give it much thought because I didn't have any choice to make and I was ocuppied I guess, but now that I'm done with school I can't get myself to do anything, for almost 2 years I didn't feel like doing anything, not even hobbies, and I don't really have fun doing anything.

I'm so limited because I live on a little town and there're no jobs I can take here or study something else easily, so I tried to get my car license but I just can't get myself to study or whatever you want to call it, so I'm stuck here which is... let's say not great.

I recently tried to start doing exercise again at home at least, but 90% of the time I still don't feel like watching anything, or talking with anyone or playing something or I don't know, so how do I get myself to do something?",14Feb2019,1
