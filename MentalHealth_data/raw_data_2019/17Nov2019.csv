0,"What does the public need to understand more about anxiety disorders and how they are different than just the ""feeling"" of anxiety? What can we do to better help people understand what it's like to have an anxiety disorder?",17Nov2019,1
1,"I, have sent a good majority of the last two years in mental hospitals, RTCs as well as Outpatient programs.

And the shit that me and those I've met in there have seen go on there is just, impressively fucked up.

In between me and others I've known, I've seen:

\- A creepy psychiatrist who told a kid if they really wanted to die they should just fake getting better to get out.

\- A dietitian that refused to accommodate a boy with a sensory disorder, causing him to lose like 20 pounds in a few weeks.

\- Staff outright refusing to admit obvious mistakes

\- Therapists snapping at patients

\- Incredibly unnecessary amounts of physical force used to stop patients. 

\- Restraining paranoid patients with no consideration for how it would worsen their paranoia

\- A kid with extremely mild autism being put in a ward where everybody else could barely talk, driving him completely fucking insane while he constantly begged to be put into our ward. 

\- And when I got put in a psych ward because they thought I was going to kill somebody, I was literally put in a metal box, probably 9 x 7 feet in size, while hearing nothing but the mad screaming of other patients.

**But despite ALL of that, my time in the system has saved my life.**

I'm on good medication now, have learned coping skills, met some amazing people who genuinely changed my life, made friendships, even if they haven't all lasted, learned tons about psychology, not only my own, but that of others as well, 

I will always tell the horror stories of those places, because it's a conversation that needs to be had, but is NOT being had anywhere.

The media, alternative and mainstream, have never brought these stories to light, and I will continue to do my part in raising awareness for how the ongoing problems that plague the hospitals.

But at the same time, when someone is really struggling I DO want them to go to these places. 

They can do so much good for rehabilitation, getting people out of dangerous and toxic environments, giving people room to breathe and heal set apart from the rest of the world. Give people tools to deal with their problems.

And I think possibly one of the biggest ones, is being able to quickly and efficiently get you on the medications you need.

Ordinarily it can take years to find the proper medication, and it still does in many cases, but being in a controlled environment where you can request changes and give updates on your condition at any time, and where you do not run the risk of being put in danger due to unforeseen side effects. You are able to get onto medications you need in a timely and safe matter. 

On top of that, the social aspect of meeting others like you can really help for growth and healing. 

there is so much good to be done here, but I have a hard time convincing people to get help because of all the bad that also goes down. 

If you are feeling suicidal, and you really think something bad is about to happen, please please please get help.

I know its scary, but it is so necessary. 

And I mean, it can honestly be kinda fun if you let it. I started playing D&amp;D with other patients, and that's been some of the most entertaining moments of my life. 

I remember making a game out of stealing sugar from the cafeteria and that lead to some of the funniest things I've seen in my entire life. 

Idk, its hard to convince people because its such a mixed bag, there is an incredibly good chance, especially if you are a minor, that at some point you will just want to go home, but its so important that you get help.

So yeah, just needed to filter my thoughts.

Don't be afraid to get help, please.",17Nov2019,1
2,My dad just told me that our house is infected with fleas and I thought I saw a bug in my bed earlier and thisll probably sound really fucking retarded but the thought of bugs in my bed is legitimately one of my worst fears and ever since I found out I've been shaking and naucious and seeing black specs everywhere and jumping at everything and itchy and sweaty am I having a panic attack or what??

3,Hey. I really don’t know how this works but it feels good to vent. I’m 29 years old and I feel like my life is an absolute joke.  I’m caught in some absolute Mickey Mouse transparent bullshit and don’t know how to fix myself just make the same constant fucking bull shit mistakes. I look after my sick mother as well as work a full time job  and it would be wrong of me to try and use this as an excuse. But all I ever do to try and escape is take drugs and get fucked up without fail. People love me for being that guy but I hate myself. I’ve lost potential relationships due to it but In all honesty I don’t care. I just try and escape. It’s horrible. I just want to be some kind of shade of normal and not feel like an absolute failure.,17Nov2019,1

5,"I have a family that supports me in whatever i do and used to always have people around me. However for 6 years i have felt very lonely and have had severe depresion. I have been in one relationship in my life which was horible. My girlfriend abused me and as we went to school together i could never get a break from her. Thankfully i was able to end the school year early because i had already done the course work 2 year prior. I realy didnt have any reason to go to school because  i had already learned all that i needed to. Being forces to sit though class after class not learning anything new with an abusive girlfriend was hell. Since i endes my year early i was also able to end things with my girlfriend. Sadly even though i have moved on from her i strugle to make any connection with new people. Cant mange to make any new friends and havet been on a date for 4 years. I am srrounded by support ING familie, but cant get any connections outside of my family. I would like some advice on how to trust people again and how to make new friends.",17Nov2019,1
6,"Often, after spending time with my friends at night, I’ll end up feeling really awful, like I’m not valued or I’d be better off gone. There also seems to be an aspect of jealousy regarding how close some of my friends are to each other. I don’t know exactly what this awful feeling is, but it makes it pretty much impossible to have fun with my friends or even fake feeling ok. Another one of my friends and myself both get this feeling from time to time, and would really like to know what it is, as it almost seems to be getting worse each time it happens. I tried to look for information on google, but I couldn’t thing of any phrase to search for.

What is this feeling called? Is there any way at all to fight it? Any strategies that could lessen its effects? 

Any help at all would be really appreciated, and I’ll answer any questions you have as soon as I see them.",17Nov2019,1
7,"I was speaking to my mother today about my fears and anxiety. She said that I am sick. I guess in a way it’s true but it felt so demeaning to hear her say it. My mental health has been pretty terrible as of late, yes, but I guess I’ve never had someone say it to me like that. She went on to say that I need something more than pills. I think this stems from my refusing to be admitted to hospital last week. She was pretty upset when I told her i had turned down my doctors offer. I didn’t see the need. In fact I was feeling ok compared to how I’ve felt during other visits with my doctor. I was a little confused about why he would admit me anyway. What was I going to tell my doctors and nurses, what would be his reason for admitting me. He increased my medication dosage and told me to see him in a week. Not much has changed in that week. I feel like they are overreacting slightly. Why not admit me when I said I was suicidal or when he wanted to change my medication. I told him I was a steady 3-4 on a scale from one to ten. It’s been steady for a few weeks. 

Maybe my mother didn’t mean anything negative by calling me sick but it really did feel horrible. I feel like she truly does not understand how the mental health system really works. It’s pretty much useless and broken. Full of cold rooms and even colder nurses. Waiting and fear and anxiety. I’ve been through it many times. Her saying I’m sick makes me feel like she also doesn’t understand me or my anxiety or depression. You’d think after 33 years she might get it even slightly. She tries I guess. I haven’t exactly been the easiest person to deal with in that time. Maybe I am sick.",17Nov2019,1
8,When I'm alone sometimes I'll hear the voices of people in my life criticising or saying nasty shit about me and even though it's in my head it's as if they're in the room with me. Should I be concerned?,17Nov2019,1
9,"    The past few years I've been having trouble caring about anything long term, especially relationships with friends and family. At any point it feels like I could drop anyone and it wouldn't really feel any different unless I mentally forced myself to be sad. This was the case recently when my little brother died at the age of 16. I love him and I do miss him, but it didn't really settle until I really sat down and focused on memories of him and envisioning his death. I think the main contributing factor to this is I have this innate expectation to be disappointed or just generally have really low expectations for things. For example just today I missed the opening concert for dreamhack in Atlanta because we got there an hour late and they didn't hand out badges after 10 even though it's a 24hour/day event. I wasn't mad at all. Even on the higher end I don't things are are suppose to be fun and invigorating tend to end up not that interesting. The only things that give me true happiness right now is music, some video games due to adrenaline rushes and some interactions with friends, but I see these as all temporary in the moment bursts of enjoyment and nothing's that's long and fulfilling. 
        I do have aspirations and visions for my future but since I'm in the military those are quite far away. But one thing that really made me care was this girl. She was depressed and really had a hard time with school. So at the time I would actually get up extra early and wake people up to come and study  for tests. Well she always asked me to come and get her but when I'd get her she would go back to sleep almost instantly. So I started waiting for her to come out and walking in with her. There is a romantic side to this that I won't get into (Her morales and decisions were purposefully Malicous toward me), but I ended up getting her to pass her finales and I don't know there was something about the situation that just made me want to be a better person than what I am now. It wasn't about her being a girl but it was something about her being helpless that made me care so much. But overall right now I just kind of feel empty. I still have friends I talk to everyday and people that love me. I'm not sad, but it's this kind of mental attitude that ends up leading to depression and suicide later. I don't want it to come to that so many advice you could give would be helpful. Thank you. If you want any additional information just ask.",17Nov2019,1
10,"After two sessions of therapy, I (25f) do not feel any better, and I do not see HOW it can make me feel better.

11,"Hey all. 27f. I’m not sure what’s wrong. I feel bad for thinking I could depressed. People use the phrase so willy nilly nowadays, but I don’t know at what point sadness turns into something more serious. I go through phases of feeling pretty good about life, then being pretty hollow. I currently don’t feel connected to much. Lately I want to give my dogs away because I’m tired of taking care of them and I don’t want to snuggle them, don’t want to touch them. My husband I struggle with physical touch with in public and saying “I love you”. Even when we’re alone sometimes I just don’t want to be touched, kissed, anything. For no reason. Lately I should be happy, we’re moving, I started a new better job, everything is on the up and up and I’m miserable. I can barely fall sleep, hardly stay asleep, have such difficulty getting out of bed, and am exhausted all day but I still can’t sleep. I feel stupid, I can’t remember shit, my brain can barely function. I’ll ask my husband the same questions twice in a matter of minutes and he’ll look at me like I’m crazy because I NEVER do that. I’m just so all over the place and I’m tired and I’m empty. I have no drive, I’m not finding joy in things but I don’t want to say it’s depression because I can still get up to go out and have some fun with friends and be normal? I don’t mean to offend anyone I’m just really confused. This happens several times a year, sometimes with a trigger and sometimes for no reason at all. I’ve been going to therapy for some months now and I’ve made great strides but I’ve been in a good place lately so we haven’t talked about these swings yet. I go next Monday so I’ll bring it up then.

12,"Hello everybody,

My friend (30m) is generally a good guy with a stable job, a girlfriend and a normal amount of friends. He's sometimes easily irritated (he then gets irrationally angry at things and starts stressing over minor inconveniences), but generally I think of him as stable.

Last night, we were boardgaming. We drank a little alcohol (not much), and were in a good mood. The game was quite complex and the teams were quietly pondering the next moves. Suddenly, the friend grabs an empty glass beer bottle, smashes it three times with full force on the table. After it didn't break, he threw it against the wall and it broke. Silence ensued. Then, he puts his hands in front of his face, visibly panting, and says ""oh no, oh God, what did I do, I'm so sorry, that's so embarrassing!""

He asks us to play on, while he, still visibly distressed but calming down, cleans up the glass. After a few minutes, he comes back, apologises again and says that it was a panic attack induced by a flashback to an experience in 2007 where he nearly died in a storm.

I am unable to map this apparently compulsive behavior to ptsd-induced panic attacks. I'm reasonably close to him, so I was wondering wether he's diagnosing himself plausibly. 

Also, this behavior seems nearly too dangerous to ignore (this could accidentally have ended very badly), so I'm not sure what therapy I can expect him to seek. (We're in Europe.)

Thanks for any input.",17Nov2019,1

15,"basically i'm obsessive and it's bad
a good place to start is how i had social anxiety since i was 12,then i moved countries at almost 15 and it got unreasonable and retarded the past year,then this may i noticed how i was paying too much attention to something that didnt matter and not even taking care of my brother properly, which is my main priority.
on april i fell in love,we'd been talking and shitposting together since november and chatting since april,and this was the point where i confessed and decided to focus on what mattered instead of what people thought of me
now i have confidence and i actually feel my presence,blablabla, i also have flaws but will fix them when it's necessary and all that
then out of nowhere pure o explodes, and paranoia,first fear of her cheating,then fear of me cheating in the future,or pedo ocd, a bunch of sexually fucked up overthinking
i started recovering late june,a month after the relationship started,her support had me amazed and once i was ""over everything and could prioritize them both"" i literally get clingy and dependent on her opinion of me,out of nowhere.no more chemistry or shared mutual fun or feeling myself and talking about dumb shit together,nor confidence,and since ive also helped her with insecurities i start feeling like i am and should be reliable and powerful,which turns into an obsession to always be entertaining and a reliable genius,and after a few months of being agressive,i get clingy af,and now i'm not really fully retarded about every conversation,but i've actually lost track of myself and like everything else,and get angry at every minor thing that doesn't go my way, in general.if i looked at myself in a may perspective,i'd look like i was acting like relatives i always thought ""what the fuck how can they be so dependent and not aware of calming the fuck down"" but i mean i've turned like that,and honestly i feel like i can't get my shit together (or it'll go back to being like this in the future) but i do know that's me being insecure
still it does feel like my insecurities just went from one thing ti another and i'll be over this and never have it as a problem again,but even if i feel like a conversation is going well, at one point i do start feeling or thinking about power over the other person(literally just her or my brother) and my self image is basically a rollercoaster because of that
and i do know i should calm down,but i've also become more spaced and distracted,and also that alone makes me feel like i can't feel shit,or think properly, or just calm down, and adds to feeling like a retard.and yeah its a big mess of overthinking,and the point of posting here was mainly to ask if there's any specific illnesses this could relate to
obviously ocd,and symptoms of borderline and ocpd
and if i used ""avpd treatment"" to deal with overthinking social anxiety,i'd like a source or some shit that can be similar to this situation,because it's definitely better than no clarification and probably enough to help me stop overthinking

16,"I hate my university course. I'm unable to switch it due to financial reasons (I lose my scholarship if I do and couldn't afford it without it) and my girlfriend. My girlfriend isn't from my country and is staying in my country to be with me and is expecting me to finish university in Computer Science. 

I feel anxious going to university. It's where I sit under harsh lights and look at a computer screen all day. I hate it. I'm stressed to the point my sleep quality is virtually none existant and I'm crying being in bookshops. Literature and the arts was what brought me happiness before I entered university and I loved going to bookshops but recently I went to my universities bookshop and felt myself well up. I feel like I'm losing myself doing Computer Science. When I was a child I was told I would love university but I just don't. I'm tired. I feel like and idiot most of the time when I'm there. I don't understand concepts as well as my peers and end up spending far more time on assignments and study. I can't take it anymore. When I talk to my parents about it my mother doesn't listen to me and tells me I should be lucky to have the opportunity to go to college but I was too young to make a proper choice in going. I can't take going to this place anymore.

I have told my girlfriend everything but I don't think she understands the severity of what I feel. I feel like there is a weight on my shoulders, 
I'm just so tired. I've been waking up with headaches sometimes. I drink a lot of water. My diet is fine. It's just the stress of being forced into this degree and forced to stay in it. I don't know what to do.

28,"Aight so this post ain’t about me, it’s about my mom and to be honest if this doesn’t make sense, don’t worry I have an extremely tough time explaining this also. So basically, my mom thinks she is being watched or followed or stalked or whatever. She thinks any type of reflection from anything is a sign of something bad, like say a reflection off a shiny material, or a closed TV or shut off phone with a reflection of her, she thinks that it is watching her, I try to explain to her that it’s literally nothing it’s the material. And she freaks out and yells at me and if it escalates she gets aggressive. She isn’t the most educated person, she is a Chinese immigrant. So that comes with a struggle to make money, but she doesn’t want to strive for working and making 30k a year, so she began marijuana growing houses out in the West Coast and we are from the East Coast. So that’s the background of when she started acting like this. She thinks the government is after her, specifically the Chinese government, because she sent some back home to China and some trouble happened, a couple of her friends got arrested, and it is real strict over there, some are doing 15 years some are doing life. So she thinks people are now after her because she’s the reason why it happened, and she thinks if she gets arrested, her brothers back home in China wouldn’t be able to come to a America, and she wouldn’t be able to take care of my grandfather who is aging via sending money back. So she does have a huge burden on her, she wants to help so much that it is slowly destroying her. I feel so bad but pissed off because she is ruining the household. She gets angry and tries to explain her bullshit and shuts off all the phones because she thinks they are eavesdropping, She also makes extremely stupid statements, like why every morning I hear a plane at the same exact time, I say “mom it’s a commercial flight they have the same times each day for a specific destination” and also “if the planes really were spying you, trust me they would’ve caught you long ago” and she gets furious and aggressive. There is 300 million Americans, if they really are going to put a spy plane to hover above us, you would have to be on some FBI top 5 most wanted type shit, which she isn’t. She thinks she is being hunted down. All my possessions and even others in the household are being messed up by her. She thinks my PS4 is dangerous, she sees the flashing light of my controller and freaks out, I had the NBA 2k19 video game disc inside my PlayStation, and she was probably messing around with it trying to find something “dangerous” and pressed the eject button and saw a disc and freaked out and snapped it in half. What the fuck is up with her, she is a great mom most of the time but when she starts doing her daily thing of whatever this bullshit is, it’s really demoralizing for the whole family. I don’t know what the hell is going on and why the fuck she is doing this fuckshit and fucking up all my phones, TVs, games, or whatever the fuck other technology I have my nigga. Fuck she even thinks the reflection off a fucking shower thing is a sign of being watched since she can see herself. Like my nigga are you that fucking dumb it’s a fucking reflection off the material. I don’t know what to say, and if you find this shit confusing, shit it definitely is, this shit been going on for 8 months and I never knew how to explain it without it having sound crazy to people, but fuck it I explained it so please help me thank you so much for your time.",17Nov2019,1

31,"This is my first ever Reddit non-comment post, and I don't even know what I'm doing. I don't know if these are needed, but I would rather do it and not need it than vice versa, so..

CW: suicidal ideology, despair and existentialism.

So.. hi. I'm a 28yo with ADHD and BPD. I don't know what to call, or how to describe, this feeling that is ruining my life, so I don't know how to get help from my doctor for it, but I'm hoping someone here might know what's going on or have felt something similar and have more words to describe it. Or at least let me know I'm not alone.

A bit of background: My psych team right now is not particularly a great fit for me. Or probably for anyone, if I'm being realistic. They don't seem to give a single fuck. They don't listen to me when I'm trying to describe this feeling, or much at all. They give you exactly 30min in therapy. 

In my experience it was 30min of a person who I cannot relate to at all culturally, demographically, emotionally, recreationally, socially or politically, telling me that I'm basically not trying hard enough. Yes, if I try really really hard, coping mechanisms be damned, I will definitely be cured from my terrible disease of laziness and whining. Yes, 'buckle down and get it done,' is great advice for executive dysfunction. Yes, because my weight doesn't affect my ability to do all the other hobbies I may enjoy, I'm being shallow and need to prioritize. Who needs to love themselves? Shallow people only, that's who. It should be good enough to know that you're a piece of shit if you think what you look like is a priority of any sort. 

At 31min she literally dismisses you, even if you're in the middle of a sentence. Just interrupts with ""our time is up now, see you next month,"" and shows you out. She might as well just holler ""NEXT"" like a frustrated government office clerk.

It's 15 min with my psychiatrist, and she almost always says something to the tune of, ""that's something to talk to your therapist about, that's not what I do."" Neither of them even TRIED to listen to me about this, even though I told them both it's destroying huge swaths of my life. I'm on a couple of waiting lists for new clinics but it could be a few months before I can be seen by a new team, as I'm on Medicaid and there aren't many mental health facilities that take Medicaid, and again, I'm on Medicaid, so paying out of pocket is out of the question. It's the Medicaid waiting list or nothing at all for me.

Now that the background is out there, I'm gonna give describing the actual Thing my best shot. I'm sorry if I do a terrible job at elucidating and this is an incomprehensible mess. I'm gonna do my best, though, so please bear with me.

One of my biggest and most frustrating issues with This is that I don't have any words for it. I've never felt anything similar to it and I've never heard anyone else say anything that sounds like it could be this. Every other feeling I've ever experienced, I've at least seen someone put it into words somewhere, or been able to describe it myself, but not this. I've never heard any words that ring true to describe it, so I'm gonna do my best but I might fail spectacularly. It sort of feels like how I imagine a fairytale curse would feel, where I have knowledge of something but whenever I try to speak about it I just.. can't. Physically can't.

So I guess it's kinda.. similar to feeling like you're in some kind of waking nightmare, but not in an 'everything is going wrong, my life is a nightmare because bad things happen' kind of way, more like when you are having a nightmare, and you subconsciously know it's a nightmare even if you don't recognize that you're asleep, but nothing is actually scary or bad, and yet, everything still feels wrong. I have BPD and ADHD, so I experience anxiety often and I've had recurring panic attacks since adolescence.. and this is a distinctly different feeling than anything else I've ever felt. It's like the fabric of the universe has been.. altered and perverted. Things still feel real, I still feel like I'm in my body and aware and not dissociating as I understand it, but everything just feels so.. gross and wrong. And this is where I usually lose any attempts at words, because it's more than this, and it feels TERRIBLE, but I don't even know what part of me feels terrible or what kind of terrible it is. My.. consciousness.. hurts..? My self-awareness, my existential awareness.. I don't know, those don't seem quite right but it's the closest I can figure out. And hurt is.. also the wrong word. It does hurt me, as a secondary action, but the feeling itself isn't pain. It's.. what the fuck is it, I do not know. It's sort of like.. the same.. whatever part of me that feels humiliation, which I'm also not sure what that's called, but instead of humiliation it's despair. Despair isn't the right word, either though. This is impossible and I want to give up, but if I give up I'm probably going to spiral into a suicidal depression, so I'm going to keep going.

I always want to escape my head. It's.. a bad headspace, and I used to drink insane amounts or get fucked up in any way I could to avoid it. I used to drink bottles of cough syrup just to give my brain a different feeling. I ran from it, but I don't even know what 'it' is. It's like.. if boredom had a murderous and explicit cousin. I actually don't want to die anymore, so I've stopped going straight to dangerous vices like drugs and drinking, and that's important enough to me most of the time to stop me from going down that destructive path, but once in a long while (8 months to a year) the Bad feeling can get so bad that I lose rationality and get suicidal. I usually use some kind of dangerous vice then. Without rational thoughts, it's the best I can do. Sort of.. like playing Russian roulette instead of outright shooting myself with a fully loaded weapon. Neither is healthy, both are very dangerous, no one should do either of these things, but at least with Russian roulette you have a chance at seeing another sunrise. I'm getting stronger, though. I'm in recovery. 

The Bad Thing isn't present all the time, and doesn't seem to be related to anything else I deal with, like my mood swings or my anxiety. Sometimes I'm just fine and then all of a sudden BAM nightmare world. Sometimes I'm anxious as fuck, panicking, maybe feeling like my organs are all failing at the same time, but existence in general doesn't feel like a monster. Lately, I have been getting anxious BECAUSE of The Bad Thing. Bad Thing first, anxiety follows. I don't know what it could be tied to. I feel so clumsy and heavy and stupid. I know I'm not stupid, but this Thing makes me feel so stupid and small for not being able to describe it or know what it is. And it's all the more terrifying to me because it has no name and no face. Does anyone else have a faceless, nameless Bad Thing that sends you to actual hell every so often? Does anyone know what that might be called?

If you read all this, thank you so much for even listening to me. Even if you have no idea what I'm talking about. Thank you for caring, at least a shred, what I had to say.",17Nov2019,1

I’ve never told anyone about the things I’ve thought in the past... but this has been on my mind for far too long and I need to let it out already, and does anyone know the name to what I might possibly have? So these weird pattern of thoughts started around the summer of 2016. I don’t really know how to start this off one night while sleeping over at a friends house, I started to think, “what if I can’t fall asleep ever again?” Everyone around me was asleep, and I literally started getting paranoid about not being able to sleep, and was telling myself that there was something wrong with me because I was the only one awake. I stayed up till 7 that day paranoid out of my mind. So basically after that night I started having that obsessive thought, and a few weeks later after we moved, it revolves around me so much I literally feel like I forgot myself. Like I would wake up at legit 6 am every morning and would always make sure to go to sleep early, which I think turned me into a perfectionist because I don’t remember hanging with anyone that summer, just cleaning the house to be perfect and always doing everything perfect. Now that I look back, I have no idea why I was like that, at all. So anyway these thoughts get really bad, and one night when I’m trying to sleep I got an image in my head of my mom murdered on the floor, like legitimately I thought about it so much and this thought to kill my mom came into my head, I literally got up, walked to the kitchen, grabbed it, and put it down cause I knew what I was doing wasn’t right. I felt so ashamed of myself. I’ve never told anyone this stuff before, and there has got something wrong with me. I’ve always been labeled as bitchy, and I really was as a kid, my older sister recently told me that she would literally avoid me because I was just like my mom, who I’m pretty sure is a sociopath. It’s been over 3 months since I’ve had a genuine conversation with her, I’ve grey rocked her for a while and she totally ignores me, and I know that it’s supposed to hurt, but I don’t really feel hurt. At times I do, but idk, there’s just something off with me. Towards the end 2017, one night before a trip to Washington D.C with my sister and I, after being in my head so much, I thought to myself, “what if I lose the ability to communicate??” Which I ignored but literally the thoughts got so bad that I started depersonalizing, slowly. After that night, everything went downhill, I lost all of my frequents because I was scared that I was going to sound stupid, and I’ve been more depressed than I ever have. My I don’t even know how to explain all of this but sorry if it’s all scattered, I’m very scatterbrained right now, and still feel the same way that I have since that. I’ve always been really bitchy, I’ve always been extremely toxic to certain people, and I was very unaware growing up. Like my aunt said that growing up I was very unaware and wasn’t able to fully comprehend things. I know I’m not stupid, but I feel like I seem different to everyone else. Idk.

38,"I'm  really sorry for posting but i don't know what else to do. This is  going to be a long post and i'm so sorry but i also feel like the  context is very important and the situation is genuinely tearing me  apart. I posted this in another sub already but didn't receive much feedback so i'm trying my luck here. I'm very sorry i'm just genuinely desperate and i feel so lost and helpless.

My  \[22 F\] partner \[24 M\] and i met online about 5 years ago. We live in entirely different countries and due to other difficulties we have never actually met IRL. We became really good friends and then about 3 years ago we started dating. It's been a very difficult relationship with many  ups and downs and we have broken up a couple of times within the last 3  years.

He has several severe  mental illnesses (i feel terrible about posting and talking about this  without his consent so i'm not going to include details on this. If it's  needed for further/better advice let me know and i'll edit the post)  and trauma. Because of this he has difficulties trusting me and often  keeps things a secret or lies about stuff. I've been aware of this but i  never wanted to push him or make him feel uncomfortable so i've tried  to create an environment where he could open up to me on his own terms.  
Because  of this i don't have a lot of his personal IRL information. I don't  have any contact to any of his IRL friends or family. I actually don't  even know his phone number (neither mobile nor house phone) since we use  Discord to talk. I DO know his legal name because i've accidentally  seen it (he is not aware of this) and because of that i also know his  adress. I feel awful admitting it but because of the current situation  (i'll explain further below) i looked up his name and found his adress.

He's  expressed suicidal thoughts since we met 5 years ago. It took a while  but eventually he had explained to me that he formed something like a  suicide pact with his ex and planned on committing suicide on his 25th  birthday. Throughout the last 5 years i've never forgotten about it and i  dread his birthday every year but i thought the situation had gotten  better. We don't really talk about it anymore. He sometimes jokes about  suicide but as stated above i never wanted to be pushy so i often don't  question it much since he also doesn't really open up to me much. I have  tried a few times to talk about it and he gets very hostile and angry or dismissive  whenever i try to bring up the topic. When this happens he often starts  ignoring me afterwards, sometimes only for a couple of hours and  sometimes for days so i usually leave him be out of fear of just making  things worse.

I was under the  impression that he was doing better until about 3-4 months ago when his  depression hit him really hard. I tried to help the best i could but he  kept pushing me away and tried to distance himself from me and  eventually i tried giving him some space because nothing else i was  doing seemed to be working. Eventually he started talking to me a bit  more again and i thought things were mostly fine. He had also stopped  talking to the ex a long time ago, at least to my knowledge, so while  i've never forgotten about the suicide pact and it's definitely been a  big concern for me i didn't feel like it was an immediate threat.

Things  started going very bad recently when he made a lot of new friends.  While i am insanely happy for him whenever he does make friends he also  often starts neglecting me in those times. He ended up talking to his  friends often 8-12+ hours a day, several days in a row even and in turn  would ignore me. When i would ask if he wanted to call me or hang out he  didn't want to but he would go hang out with all his other friends and  not reply to any of my messages anymore. When i asked about it lightly  he would get angry at me. I would ask him to come play some games with  me and he would decline, then go play the same games with his friends.  He overall treated me a lot worse than them. I also struggle a lot with  my own mental health and i genuinely try to deal with it on my own as  best as possible. I don't want to burden him because i know he's  suffering but sometimes i need a bit of support myself and maybe just  vent some feelings out or just want to hear him tell me that he loves me  and things are gonna turn out okay. He used to do this but in the  recent months whenever i would bring up something that was hurting me he  would just tell me ""whatever, you'll get over it"" and meanwhile he  would be there listening and talking to his friends when they needed to  vent.

Had this all only been  happening for a week or maybe two i wouldn't have said a word but it was  happening for more than a month and with the months before that also  being very difficult i felt like it was straining the relationship a  lot. I felt alone and just very sad and it hurt me to see him be so nice  to everyone else while being so dismissive of me. So when i couldn't  take it any longer i decided to bring the whole situation up to him. It  took me several hours to put together a message and i was very careful,  trying not to make it seem like i was blaming him for anything. I  definitely was not and am not mad at him and i do have understanding for his  situation. Essentially what i was telling him is that i just wished we  could spend a little more time together, maybe a few hours every other  day at least and just do something nice together because i really missed  him. He got very angry at me again and eventually stopped replying to  me entirely. Again, as said above this usually happens and that's why i  don't generally bring issues like this up until i've tried everything i  could to fix it on my own. He ended up ignoring me for several days and  then eventually came back telling me he wanted to break up. I asked him  to at least tell me why because it seemed very sudden and he told me he  ""just doesn't like me anymore"" and then continued to ignore me  afterwards.

We talk on and off now  and some days are very nice and some are horrible. Some days he's very  kind and some days he insults me and just gets mad over and over again.  Yesterday was a pretty good day and we talked a lot until i asked him if  he was feeling fine which he got angry at and told me to stop asking  him how he was doing because i was annoying. I haven't heard from him since.

Now,  the reason this all concerns me so much is that we had similar  situations to this before. We had broken up a couple of times over  arguments similar to this but we managed to talk it out a couple of  weeks to a couple of months after the initial argument and then ended up  back together. After trying to talk it out he would often tell me that  he knows he treats me very badly and that he hates himself for it. He  has told me that he often treats me badly on purpose, especially when i  seem to be sad, because he thinks he doesn't deserve me and he thinks if  he treats me bad i will hate him and leave him. After he told me he  wanted to break up i mentioned this to him. I asked him quite directly  if he genuinely didn't want to be with me or if he was doing it because  he knew he hadn't been treating me well and was trying to get rid of me  so i wouldn't be sad. He never replied to me. At the same time he has  often expressed that he loves me and doesn't want me to leave him.

The  whole breakup thing was insanely sudden and it's really scaring me. We  did have that ""argument"" but a few days before that he was talking to a  mutual friend about how he really loved me because i ""get him"" and i'm  kind to him. He was also talking about having kids with me in the future  and having a family and talked about raising the kids etc. I don't see  how someone who ""doesn't like me"" would bring up these topics and talk  about them if they wanted to break up a few days later.

I  fear that he was being and still is so hostile because he plans on  killing himself and he's trying to get rid of me so that i won't feel  bad. This is something he had mentioned to me as well many years ago.  He's been distancing himself from his friends as well and has told a few  people privately that he was indeed going to kill himself on his  birthday to a point where several people have asked me what's going on  because they see his behaviour as worrisome as well. A mutual friend  (who wasn't aware of this situation prior) asked him if he had any plans  for his birthday and he told our friend that he was planning to commit  suicide.  
He hasn't gotten me any gifts in more than a year but a few  weeks ago bought me and some of his friends some stuff and told us all  it was our early christmas presents. I'm scared he's doing this because  he doesn't plan to be alive by christmas.  
Overall there is a huge  shift in his behaviour and him constantly talking about how he is  definitely going to commit suicide just really aligns with everything  else and it's terrifying. His birthday is in just a few days and i've  tried just being friendly and checking in on him in hopes of him just  opening up a little bit and every time things go well he suddenly turns  very mean the day after. The fact that he has mentioned for 5 years that  he was going to commit suicide on his 25th birthday and then starts  behaving in this way just a few months before exactly that birthday  while expressing the wish to commit suicide so much just genuinely is  something that's scaring me. I'm having nightmares about him dying and  it's tearing me apart. I constantly look to see if he's online, if he's  playing any games to just make sure he's still alive. I feel like to a  lot of people this situation might not seem very serious but things were  fine before this and the second he started mentioning the suicide pact  again a few months back everything just started to escalate.

I  just really don't know what to do anymore. I really love him so much  and i just want him to be happy. I feel really selfish for saying it  like this but i don't want him to die.  
What can i do at this point?  Should i bring all of this up to him and tell him how i feel and what i  think is going on? Should i just sit by and wait?

When  i took psychology in school they taught us that when dealing with  someone who is suicidal the best approach is to ask them directly if  they want to kill themselves and then go from there. I'm honestly not  sure if that's the right way to go about it. I'm scared it's gonna make  things wrose, i'm scared hes gonna get angry at me again and i'm scared  he's gonna just block me and leave.  
At the same time my attempts to  lightly bring up things or just trying to create a happier environment  have gotten me absolutely nowhere. I try to check up on him every day,  ask him if he's doing alright and as said above that's just made him  angry as well. I tried inviting him to stuff he might enjoy and  sometimes he goes along with it and laughs and seems to have fun but  then suddenly snaps and gets mad again.

I  feel like i'm failing him and with only a few days left until his  birthday it's all messing me up. I feel like i can't do anything to stop  him, it's not like i can just go to his house or call him real quick.  If he goes through with it i'd never even find out cuz his family  doesn't even know i exist. With me accidentally finding out his legal  name i've been thinking maybe i just wait and see and if i don't see him  on his birthday maybe i can somehow contact the police where he lives? I  don't even know if this is an option since i don't live in the same  country and i don't think i could even afford that phone call (not being  stingy, i have no income).

I'm so  heartbroken over the whole breakup thing. I'm so scared for his safety.  I feel like such a failure and i just don't know what to do. I can't  ask anyone for help. I feel like my time is running out. I wanna help  him so bad and i wish we could just talk it out. I wish he would just  tell me what's wrong. At this point im hoping he just genuinely hates me  and that's all there is to it. Even tho it breaks my heart i'd rather  he hated me than him being dead.

I'm sorry this was so long and messy.",17Nov2019,1
39,"I really need advice and help with this one besides the ""if they refuse help then stop trying to give it"" that will inevitably show up in the comments. Please. I'm afraid that he probably won't live if I just give up on him.

My online friend has an incredibly rough life and is suffering from severe childhood trauma and constant stress from both his father being mentally abusive, and from the already overwhelming amount of problems that come with being trans, and it visibly weighs on him. He posts near daily in the vent channels of a Discord server we are both in, and constantly makes not-so-jokes about wanting to kill himself, and I don't know how to help him. No one else really comments on it, and I feel like it might be because they're used to it.

Whenever I ask if he's okay or try to help him in any way, he insists that he's fine or that nothing's wrong, even directly after a response about one of his vents or ""jokes."" I don't know how to help him at all, as he outright refuses it and denies even messages that he sent less than five minutes ago. I can't just abandon or give up on him, as I care too much and would never be able to get it off my mind that I failed to prevent him from going through with it. I've already failed one friend in the past, and I already can't really handle that, I couldn't handle living with the weight of another death I didn't prevent. Even further, I quite literally owe him my life, as he pulled me out of one of the lowest points in my life that was just going to spiral even further down.

I don't understand what I'm supposed to do when he helps others, but he himself refuses to accept help in return. It hurts to see him suffering and I don't know how long it is until he decides to go through with it. I need to know what I can do to help pull him out of this. I can't let him suffer or die like this. I'm scared of losing him after he's helped me and so many other people.

Please r/mentalhealth, please help me save my friend. Please don't let him die on me.",17Nov2019,1
40,"&gt;Hello,  
  
&gt;  
&gt;By the time you’re reading this, I will no longer be on Earth. I thought I’d leave a note on my profile explaining myself.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;My brain doesn’t have the ability to distinguish time - it doesn’t matter if something happened a week ago, 1 year ago, or 5 years ago, all of it continues to affect me, and despite therapy, there isn’t a clear sign it is going to stop. It keeps me up at night, wakes me up at early hours in the morning, and winds me into trouble at work because I’ll find myself ranting to myself about something that happened at fifteen. I constantly relive every positive and negative experience I’ve had, and this has been ongoing since late 2017. It is an insane way to live. I don’t have the ability to move on like other people.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;But I’ve been lucky. Incredibly lucky. I’ve lived in 3 countries, I’ve skydived, I’ve made love, I’ve made friends from all over the world, I’ve travelled with friends from USA and Switzerland, done stand-up comedy, ran a semi-successful YouTube channel, organised a TEDx conference, and all sorts. I’ve been lucky to experience a wide range of things.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;But unfortunately, I’m stuck with a condition which has disturbed me for years and it won’t stop. I’ve been seeing a psychologist but I’m not convinced anything is going to change.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;I bullied others as a teenager and put people through things they didn’t deserve. This fills me with guilt as an adult. It may seem like I’m just being a dick, but it was a cry for help. I was hurting inside and taking it out on the world. I regret that. The rude and malicious in your life are probably hurting, too. When you realise they’re afraid, it is hard to be as hurt.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Life is short. Fuck what people think or say. Go out and do what you wanted to do. There’s so much out there to do, create, experience, and achieve. Don’t let fear stop you. Don’t be afraid to stand out.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;As Sam Berns says in his TEDx Talk, be okay with what you can’t do, because there is so much you can do. Don’t look back, just keep looking forward.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;It is easy to get bogged down by atrocities in the news, but seriously, in daily life, human kindness is fucking everywhere. Throughout my struggle for years, I’ve had support from so many places. Despite the problems, society is pretty neat place. We are the luckiest generation that has ever lived. On average, we are longer living, richer, healthier, more educated, safer and, even, happier, than any other people who have ever lived throughout history. Worldwide extreme poverty is declining, global crime is declining, global violence is declining. Innovation is constantly improving society and it is really exciting.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Above all, remember how lucky you are - to be alive, to have arms and legs, to have a home, access to food and water, access to education, safety. It is easy to forget, but at your worst day, you’re doing better than someone’s best day.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;So that’s all I wanted to say.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for every who has been part of the experience - both good and bad. You’ve all had something to teach me.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m out. It’s been a fun ride, but I’m really suffering. Life is short: Be kind, make the most of it.

41,"There is a plethora of things that I've been through, from a family member molestation affecting myself and others in my family, friend being killed or died by suicide, bullied relentlessly growing up, family dysfunction, my dad passing away unexpectedly from a heart attack at 55, moving out of state and my mother in turn also moving 12 hours away, no true friends that check up on me or reach out to say hi other than some of my Xbox live friends on Facebook chat. I have ADHD, anxiety and depression, had a heart scare last year (AFIB and hospital stay for 3 days) lost my tech support job (outrageously stressful and stretched too damn thin) and terrified to work in fear of stress and work affecting me again like my last job did, and my marriage with my wife is struggling. I've seen a psychologist when i was 1, didn't really help since I'm trapped in my own head. I want to work but can't do another high stress job, also not really physically demanding as I'm out of shape and doing the best i can with going from day to day.  My great if my uncle passing from the same heart related issue when he was 39 (I'll be 36 at the end of the month) has been on my mind and won't go away. I feel like I'm just ""here"".

45,"Hey guys, I guess I'm looking for advice here.

I've known for years that I'm a highly emotional person. My brain generally finds things to be sad about or ruminate over, despite my circumstances being relatively good - well-educated, nice family, good job, loving partner, etc. Especially during certain times of the month, I have particularly bad weeks where I will cry myself to sleep for seemingly no reason, I want to excuse myself from social events, it's hard to be productive, and socialising feels like a chore. Also, my brain has a weird tendency to feel sad first, *then* find reasons to be sad. 

In addition, I'm quite aware of my mild(?) social anxiety. Anticipating social events with several people triggers my brain into a flight-or-flight mode, where I'll automatically try to think of excuses to escape them. One-on-one interactions with people (even friends and acquaintances) exhausts me and I find myself looking back at interactions in hindsight, pin-pointing reasons I probably embarrassed myself. Being in small crowds (like house parties) where people are meeting, socialising, and generally being 'chill' makes me extremely anxious and uncomfortable.

The thing is, I function pretty well in general - I study, I work, and I keep up my relationships pretty well. I just have occasional moments of debilitating(?) mental states; times when I'll be surrounded by friends and want to cry, or in the middle of a conversation and want to run away somewhere where I can be alone.

I guess I'm only posting now because I've had a particularly bad week where almost all my insecurities (body image, relationship trust, success with studies) came to the forefront. I'm looking into seeing a GP and asking for a referral for therapy and/or medication, but it's just that I don't know how many issues are required to be considered ""serious"" enough for referrals. 

(Side note: I find it funny that even after 5 years of studying tertiary-level psychology, I don't know how to approach these issues when it comes to myself, hah).

Does anyone have any advice for what I should do? Is this serious enough to see a doctor for? What are people's experiences with un-diagnosed depressive/anxiety symptoms?

TLDR; I seem to have depressive and anxiety symptoms but don't know if they're serious/frequent enough to see a doctor for.",17Nov2019,1

47,I grew up being forgetful about a lot of things which was kinda convenient if it's a secret that I shouldn't be telling anyone. But the most that's bothering me are very simple things I do everyday. I know I locked the door of my dorm (sometimes I'd do something repetitive like touch the knob 3x or tell myself I did it 3x)  but I'd still want to check it because the memory of me locking it doesn't feel real. I even overthink and get anxious that something bad's gonna happen to the room when I'm in a hurry and can't check if I've locked the door. There's also this occasion when someone is talking to me and I'd instantly forget what they'd say because I'm doing something or something else is in my mind.,17Nov2019,1
48,"I've been doing some self-discovery as I get older, allowing myself to dig deeper into experiences I had as a child in hopes to understand who I am as an adult. 

I suffer from BPD. My parents broke up before I was born and I went three years before being allowed to spend time with my father where I then saw him every Wednesday and every other weekend. 

I lived two different lives. My father and his wife had a lot of money for a very short time and bought my biological brother and me a lot of toys, clothes, pool, cars, etc. Anything we wanted so naturally, we liked dad’s place better. Mom had all the rules, no fun! 

Well my dad actually turned out to be a horrible person, narcissist, abuser to my step sister when my brother and I weren't there, animal abuse, frequent rage episodes that he hid from us (as long as he could at least), chronic cheater (cheated on my mom when my brother was 1 yr old and got another woman pregnant followed by cheating on her again when pregnant with me).  Oh, and plot twist, he’s a pastor now. 

BPD is often caused from traumatic events and as I've dug deeper into my past I've started to remember some... Disturbing... Memories. Anytime those thoughts come up though I get so sick to my stomach and they immediately seem foggy to me and I move on. How can I not even know/remember everything that happened to me as a child?


I have felt betrayed by my experiences with him and robbed from spending time with my amazing mother because my stepmom and father trashed her constantly, fueling my teenage angst towards her. I have gone through extensive therapy after years of self-harm, which my dad knew about but never told anyone, eating disorders, suicide attempts, constant firings from jobs, etc. Can I be so emotionally wrecked from this that my mind simply lost those.memories to heal?",17Nov2019,1

I know this is “normal”, but it’s become a problem for me because so many songs make me feel sad! And the odd thing is that most of them are actually upbeat, happy songs! Many of these songs trigger a feeling of nostalgia which happens for everyone. But there are even songs I’ve only just listened to that make me feel sad. Sometimes my sister will play an upbeat song and It gets me all down, which understandably confuses my family. Does anyone else have this problem, and does anyone know why this is?

52,"I’m currently at my friends house. We brought up the past, and I’m now holding back tears lol. I’ve always had destructive tendencies and thinking back brings me to the blood and the tears which I’ve shed. Over a girl who didn’t deserve them, and who didn’t understand them. 

When I was younger I was very shy (my mother claims was a result of the divorce), because of this I found it a difficult task to make friends. I ended up becoming friends with two girls. These girls happened to be, although young, very toxic for my young self. One of the girls in particular, would constantly touch me. I never knew and will never know if her intentions were malicious. However, with all the pinching, punching, kicking, tackling, and groping. I grew up a little scared of others. (They also kept me from talking to others and would physically drag me away from others). 

During this time, my mother was abusing my sister for being gay. (Which I am also.) I don’t remember any of this, but when it’s brought up my bones ache as if I had been hit as well. (NUMEROUS other events happened which added to stress, depression, and my awkwardness.) 

I used to see her in my dreams every night. Wonder how she’s doing. My other friend got jealous of us and forced me to bully her and stop all communication with her. It got to the point where she had to go to therapy. I wonder if she even remembers what she did to me, probably not.

Whenever I closed my eyes, I could see her. I could see myself waking up, and seeing her looming over me and practically drooling over my face before climbing onto me as I woke. I kicked her off and wrestled her to the ground (I don’t remember what happened after.). 

I cut my wrists arms and legs till I bled buckets into the tub but never enough to kill me apparently because I’m still here. Not wanting to get caught I’d minimize and strategize my cuts. Then I’d poor lemon juice and water into the cuts or just lick them so they’d sting. I wanted to fucking die. I still want to fucking die, but now I don’t feel as rushed. 

Ever since these flashbacks I’ve had hallucinations follow me around. (See my other post for more on that lol)

The fact that I was not there and that I couldn't help, the fear that I still have for violence to scalate, the mixed media coverage it got, and the uncertainty of what holds for my country have created this mix of feelings I do not know how to cope with. When I saw my people fighting for their rights everything else seemed pointless.

57,"This is going to be long but please someone bare with me.  My main question is:
 
What is y’all opinions on microdosing? And 
 What is the best way to obtain let’s say a months worth of microdose of psilocybin Or at least 21 days 

HERES MY BACKSTORY. 

I am 28 years old and my mom is 44. I truly believe her mental health is becoming a big problem and it’s to the point where I know she needs help and she knows something is not right but she is super paranoid and refuses to go on any type of medication cuz she thinks Child Protective Services will take her kids away. I have 2 little sisters and a little brother. Ages 11, 12, and 18. I am not sure what is wrong with my mom but this is what I do know

1. Her mom (my grandma) was in a mental institution because her mind was not right. Idk what she had. My mom says they never figured it out but i recall my mom saying she would have very angry outbursts at random people. I recall seeing my grandma at the age of 5. She was in some type of goverment housing and had tons of pills she was suppose to take. 

So it’s genetic

2. My mom has been pretty emotional her whole life. When she’s mad she explodes. And often other times she’s crying. She basically had no one raise her and then she started raising me. Granted it was rough back in the day but things should be better for her now. She’s married and has a stable home life. 

She can be real back and forth. Has a huge heart but don’t get her mad.

3. Her sensitivity is and paranoia is getting obvious. I live in Texas and she is in California now days but just from phone calls she will burst into tears at the mention of someone’s name. One time she called me saying someone was out to get her. She was so scared and wouldn’t FaceTime me because thought someone would watch her through her phone. Every camera on the computer in that house is covered with tape. Another time she said she went out and was driving and had no idea where she was. She knew she was going somewhere but didn’t know what state she was in or what she was doing. She stopped at a hotel and asked for help. She came to the next day. 

That was a unique episode she had and I know her life was particularly stressful because she had almost gotten a divorce. I personally believe stress triggers to have these real bad episodes. 

4. THIS MIGHT BE MY BIGGEST CHALLENEGE.

My mom is very against drugs because it is what put her mom and dads lives to an end at young ages. Her mom died when she was in her mid 40s. (About my moms age now) and her dad was 60s. 

I on the other hand have always been real open minded and have experimented with many drugs.

I am curious to hear if y’all think microdosing psilocybin may be a good an option for my mom. If I could find out where to get microses from  I would try and convince my mom to try it. I will even do it with her. From what i have stumbled upon on the internet and personally have experienced I think it would help my moms depression and hopefully fix or reconnect whatever nuerological problems she may have. I just dk what to do since she refuses to see a doctor.  I think I could convince her if I did it with her. Idk. 

If anyone has advice I would really appreciate. I’m so scared for my mom rn.",17Nov2019,1

I however do not enjoy watching the deaths of any mammals or birds (except for pelicans, i find them incredibly terrifying) and I promise you that I have not had any thoughts about killing other people.

anyway, i used to be angry all the time. i’d bust my wrist all the time because i took my anger out in physical ways. i could never hurt a person, i always felt that i deserved to feel pain. &amp; thus i have scars on my thigh, i never cut because of depression shit or “a way to feel something”. it was just anger. and somehow making myself feel pain like that seemed to justify my anger in a form of punishment. kinda like “you overreacted so much that you deserve to physically hurt”. i don’t really know how to fully explain it. but i was very angry, for quite a long time. rage attacks so bad that i’d black out. but recently i’ve been crying. a lot. A LOT. i cry about everything, things that seem unreasonable to cry about. or if something sad makes me cry, it feels like this void in my core for days on end and i feel consistently hopeless and sad. but i don’t get angry like i used to. tonight i talked to my mom about it and she said that my frequent anger transforming into frequent sadness and crying likely is grief. i asked what it is i’m grieving about so much and she said “all kinds of things, all the things that made you get so angry all the time. you didn’t always know why you were so angry, but you were because somewhere in your brain, it knows and that’s what triggers your outbursts.” so i’m kind of trying to decipher what it is i get sad about and what it might have to do with past traumas. though i’m still trying to process things that i never realized were as traumatic as i previously thought. crazy how the brain works, man. seriously. some dumb shit goes down and you can think nothing  of it until like 3 years later when you can no longer regulate your brain and the things you feel, and you’re lashing out at everything. it takes some serious analyzing to make connections between the mental blockades you deal with on a daily basis to past events that may have caused that reaction in your brain. i try to look at my being sad all the time as a step forward. constantly crying is better, and HEALTHIER than physically hurting myself in rage. but anyway, that’s all. just needed to write that out without oversharing to mutuals over social media.",17Nov2019,1

66,"Hi. Long story short I am looking to find some reading material for my dad. He seems to have a very hard time talking about his emotions. When I was younger he was the typical emotionless dad (but very loving towards me and a great dad) if you know what I mean.  It’s since gotten better but he still can’t really share how he feels. My mum has quite an issue with that since she is very open about her feelings and impulsive, and feels left out when he doesn’t talk. 
Especially when things related to his father pop up he can’t talk about them. I think my grandpa was probably a horrible father and may have left emotional scars on my dad. My mum being so impulsive doesn’t help because he hates any sort of negative emotions around him and he’s of course even more introverted when she yells at him. 

So to find good reading material, what do I look for? What is the inability to talk about emotions called? Is this always linked to trauma because what I could find  by searching for “emotional blockade“ is mostly about traumatic experiences. 

Also feel free to share good books about this, but my dad only speaks German.

I'm a combat veteran who was discharged with injuries. 

I went to a doctor for anxiety three years ago and was put on antidepressants that did not help. I finally gave it up and let my prescription of citalopram run out.

I feel that life is just meaningless being stuck in one place and being unable to get a job due to personality issues. I'm very unlikeable and can't open up to anyone. I have no friends because the extent I can socialize is to just follow a small talk script and then leave as soon as I can do so politely. There is nothing I want to talk about with anyone.

The only people I interact with on a daily basis are my father, who I hate, and my twin brother who held me down and molested me several times when I was 12-14, and I still can't get past it mentally. I snap at him a lot and threaten him when he doesn't stay away like he's supposed to. He has some kind of mental disability combined with low IQ and needs a lot of direction from other people. It's still not low enough that he can't be a decent human being, but he chooses not to. 

He comments on my body all the time, and he asks me to have sex with him. He threatened to actually kill me several times. He runs up and pushes me when I'm working with sharp objects. Our father just gives him a small slap on the wrist when he misbehaves.

I really want to get away from here, but I'm far too paralyzed internally. I'm too preoccupied with my twin brother and what he's done to screw up everything.

71,"I’m sure many can relate to having to live with a toxic family. 

To try and keep a long story short.. I live with my emotionally/physically abusive manipulative mother and her sociopath abusive (towards her) boyfriend, and well.. my 5 siblings too. I’m always the main target for my mothers outbursts and blame. I’ve gotten to the point of just having little to no patience and becoming easily irritated, frustrated, and mad at her. It’s been like this my entire life, but maybe the past was worse because my alcoholic and drug addicted grandmother ha her abusive past husband used me as a target as well, but I’m not here to tell a life story.. I need advice on what I can do to get out of this shitty situation. And if any of you have stories of having toxic family members (especially parents) that you left behind. I can’t ever cut off my family, even if they’re really bad people, but I do think it’s best for me and my mental illnesses to get away from them and not speak (temporarily) so I’ll have time to heal and recovery from all they’ve put me through. To get out of my moms manipulative grasp. I finally got fed up when she kicked my dog earlier and her reasoning was “because I don’t like him.” 

For more context on my mental illnesses.. I have a psychiatry appointment for my schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety in about 10 days. I have a therapist, but for some stupid reason I can only see her once a month. And of course, with someone dealing with issues and having no one to talk to, I *need* to see someone more than every 30 or so days. She acknowledges that, and is trying to get me into something so I’ll be able to have weekly therapy visits, but that can take months in itself to get approved. At least I got the psychiatry appointment though, right?

So there’s not much I can do there. I have an aunt, the only stable person in my family. I was considering staying with her, but I fear I’ll be a bother, and not just that.. but I have three dogs here that I can’t leave behind and wouldn’t be able to take with. My mom treats them all terribly, justifying her hurting them with “they’re stupid”. I don’t have the heart to give them away either, if I did that then it’d seriously have no one. It would just be me, seemingly against the world. And I can’t bare to go through this alone. 

What should I do?",17Nov2019,1

So for example my friends will call me to go out but I don’t want to because I’m not funny or interesting so I feel like I have nothing to contribute to a friend group so why should I show up. 
I’m quiet because why speak when I won’t bring something interesting to the conversation anyway. 
I don’t sing because my voice sounds terrible and I’m embarassed and why let anyone hear me .
I don’t dance because I’ll just be cringing at myself the whole time and others are way better at dancing anyway so why bother.
I’m just kind of in this mindset of I can’t do anything because I’ll never be good enough so why try in the first place 
why tell anyone about how i’m feeling when I’ll just look pathetic  
I’ve been crying all the time and distancing myself from everybody because I don’t want them to see me 
i just hate being the sad friend because I know I probably wouldn’t have the patience to be around someone who’s always so negative 
it’ s draining for everyone and i get it 
i don’t want to put them through that

76,"I posted to a bunch of trans places and i encourage you to read through the comments there too if you want, i want nuanced opinions and maybe some good discussion. 

First off, i have gender dysphoria. I'm currently 14 months on hrt, and i stopped taking my estrogen like 3 weeks ago.

I'm not sure what's the right decision for me.

Transition has been only traumatic for me, people leaving me, people saying horrible things to my face, my own dad locked me in my room, beat me, shouted at me and tried to kill me, and i had to escape my own place. I'm currently almost homeless. I can't find a normal partner, men who are into me are chasers, women who would be into me don't exist. Potential employers will most likely not wanna promote me and my documents (which I cannot change soon) make it super hard to get a job in the first place. 

I also seem to pass currently with no effort but I don't see it and feel horrible every time i see my manly ass face or my huge shoulders. What's the point in passing if i don't see it? If i am convinced i don't pass, then my dysphoria remains, making my irl passing completely meaningless for me. 

Plus like having invasive surgeries and not being able to feel my face sounds horrible. 

At this point i wanna go back and only have to deal with dysphoria. I don't wanna be othered. I don't wanna be chased. I don't want people to secretly think I'm a freak. It was so much easier when i was a privileged male with bad dysphoria,than it is to be hated by everyone and have slightly less dysphoria.

Yesterday i was at work, short hair, not trying to hide my shoulders, with baggy clothes so you can't see my breasts, and had small talk wuth a random guy and he thought i was a cis female, and was surprised when i told him my legal name. It made me think if detransitioning is worth it, and i feel like I'll miss how I looked on hrt. But idk, i can't take the social ostracisation.

Any thoughts? I am nearly homeless and can't afford seeing a therapist.",17Nov2019,1
77,"During the last couple of weeks, I've been able to be more structured and productive than for ages. I've been able to advance my studies in university in a reasonable fashion by mysteriously gaining motivation ""from nowhere"" (and thus get at least a bit closer to graduation; I'm on my final year) and to attend events instead of just staying home 24/7. I'm also (generally) content that my future will be more or less OK, in some way at least.

My fight with my problems (complex PTSD and extreme anxiety, along with some other things) will most likely never end entirely, but *somehow* I've started to believe that I can move onwards nonetheless - slowly or faster.

80,I’m 16 and for probably around 3 years now I’ve just been using drugs and alcohol to cover up any issues i find in life. when i was around 10/11 i started hearing voices. I would hear family members and people talking when no one was there or just hearing random noises that just couldn’t be real. But it confused me because what if they were real. Then i began hearing these different voices. That are there constantly. They put me down and insult me and make me very paranoid. A lot of other mental health problems were going on that i’m not going to go into any detail about on here but i began using unhealthy coping mechanisms. It started with just smoking weed but then it moved onto regular cocaine use and pills and lots and lots of alcohol. I’ve only ever really drank straight spirits. Ill go through a litre bottle or more every time i drink and i mix it with nothing. By the time i was 14 i’d been cutting or burning myself for a about 5 years and eventually last year people found out. Then i opened up about everything except the drug and alcohol use and they seemed like they wanted to help me. But then everything got out of hand and i was in and out of hospital for alcohol related issues and psychosis brought on by the drugs and alcohol. And then all the support stopped. They blamed everything on the drugs and alcohol and still won’t believe that the issues were there before. I admit that the drugs and alcohol most likely made me a lot worse but the issues have always been there. It’s so frustrating trying to make them believe me that the drugs or the alcohol are just coping mechanisms i use and the use of them is because of the mental issues I suffer and not the cause. I’ve lost all hope in ever getting better and it’s getting very bad again. I rarely go a day sober and it’s ruining my life and relationships with people but i don’t even care anymore. Does that make me a bad person?,17Nov2019,1
81,"So I'm a bit troubled with myself. 

If there are words or subjects that could be touchy I'll put a spoiler on them 

I'm a student of 18 y/o and I'm a very social person.

I am in a student union(I live in Belgium and I don't know if this is the right terminology)

in between my college studies I also work a little job and I have a lot of social interactions. I am a real social person and I like to have some me time but I always feel lonely and it's slowly feeling like I'm suffocating in this feeling and  don't know why I have friends to have fun with and a few very close ones like only 2. I have everything I should have and still I feel like this and I'm getting sick of it.

I've always felt the need to have someone to love and get love back from.  Nothing sexual Perse but just hugging laying in a couch and watching stuff just.... I don't know how to properly describe it 

I don't know if this has a big influence but.

A good month back i went out of a relation of more than 2 years due to a lot of mental health scars from my relationship with her she didn't abuse me she was just very troubled and &gt;!depressed!&lt; and I gave all my love to her, and she gave a lot of  it back but it just didn't feel right after 2 years of the same hassle even though she finally got help and was WAAAY better the last 4 months that we were together, and we were truly happy. But the damage was done of the past few years of me worrying non-stop about her and not being able to forget those eyes when she had a &gt;!self harm!&lt; episode.

I just don't know why I feel like this I'm very happy and upbeat always whistling or singing loving to see a smile on people their faces when I am singing on the street and say hello and people just go from irritated morning to a happy smile.

I also have Tourette syndrome and it ruins me sometimes because i cant function when i have my tics unless i take my meds(cannabis oil, i tried all the other meds on the market, but they make me: gloomy,&gt;! depressed and suicidal!&lt;)

TL;DR :I'm short of nothing in life both socially and opportunities but I still feel like I'm suffocating in a feeling of loneliness 1/2 of the time",17Nov2019,1
82," I'm gonna sound nuts but I want to point something out. Something.................weird has been happening. It honestly feels like I'm being watched. For starters, I was looking at a meme from a movie and within 20 minutes the same movie popped up. Secondly,I've been watching this obscure channel on youtube. Right. Well anyway, today someone in a prominent group mentioned that channel. I got nervous and blocked them. I sometimes speculate that I'm being watched and that there are certain messages generally put out there to remind me that I'm being watched. It's kind of creepy and it makes me feel very uncomfortable. 

In general, I've been very irritable lately and very grumpy. A lot of things are getting on my nerves.

83,"Hey reddit, I've had a really exhausting weekend and I'll get into it in a second but during my mental breakdown I had the idea for a short 2-3 minute depression awareness trailer that shows the reality of what actually happens when someone reaches the bottom of the depression barrel. I wrote everything down because I don't want to forget it and it does get dark but that's how it is sometimes. So it's been a rough week for me, my thoughts have really gotten to me this week, worked 50+ hours, I ended up accidentally hurting myself and laughed about it, then my car broke down on me.  I jumped in the shower and just sat In the tub thinking. After my shower I went to the kitchen to make food  and randomly got light headed and felt sick, I went to the bathroom and looked at myself in the mirror and I was pale. Next thing I know I'm on the floor having a full on  breakdown. my dogs came to try and comfort me but I knew I just had to let it all out because I've been holding everything in recently. If there's any film directors or students in the western ontario that are down with making a mental health awareness short clip I'd be interested into putting it on film to spread awareness, thanks reddit and I hope everyone gets the help they need or even just vent to someone so you aren't alone!",17Nov2019,1

85,"Unfortunately for avid fans of the snooze button, science is not on their side. 

Your body already gets ready for the  waking process before your first alarm. But when you snooze the alarm and sleep off after already waking once, sleep experts say, your brain and body are more likely to experience a discomfort called ‘sleep inertia’.

Sleep inertia can stay with you throughout the day, making you actually feel more tired throughout the day.

The consequence can worsen your whole day !
Science suggests that hitting the snooze button can not only disrupt healthy sleep patterns, but may leave you feeling drowsy for the rest of the day.

You may end up feeling even more tired or fatigued than you would feel after simply waking with your first alarm.",17Nov2019,1

I don't like the idea of being an emotional burden on someone. I've seen the effects it has had on people and I don't want to impose my problems on others. Whether people care to admit or not, actually being there for someone is emotionally draining. I think, in the past, I've manifested my issues in very very negative ways and I'm still trying to find healthier coping mechanisms. I want to be able to actually talk to people who I value about how I'm doing, but it's hard. I tend to record voice notes sometimes to make myself feel better. Most of my friendships are one sided, and that's fine because I don't mind listening. But some times, life wears me down. I don't care for whether a stranger on the internet wants to console me. I just wish the people I cared about equally cared about me. It's not out of a lack of honesty that I don't articulate my emotions, but rather a fear that people might just leave. You're always expected to say you're fine and that's dumb. It's okay not to be fine sometimes. Or so I'd like to tell myself. I'm quite avoidant when I'm not fine and I guess it's because I don't want to ruin someone's day. I wish someone would just... ah, it's okay. It is what it is, I guess.

90," I have a history of disordered eating and bulimia. I haven't exercised in years and have basically become completely disconnected from my body. Recently I've been feeling the need to move my body, like it's crying out for it. I started going to the gym and the first few times felt amazing. I want to keep exercising, but I've found myself falling into old habits. Each time I've been pushing myself to stay longer and thinking critically about what I eat and the amount I'm burning off. Even something as simple as calorie counting can be dangerous for me. I decided to go for a swim today to take the pressure off and some of my friends turned up at the pool and I made my excuses and left because I felt so self conscious of my body and fitness level, even though I've been to the pool with them plenty of times previously. I know the typical advice is to join some sort of sports team so I'm moving for a reason but a real trigger for me is my fitness level being competitive and feeling self conscious about that.

92,"My friend and I started university this year. I've taken to it like a duck to water. She hasn't had such luck.  

I knew settling would be more difficult for her because she has aspergers but I hoped once she'd threw herself in to university life she'd settle a bit more. Unfortunately that hasn't happened.  

Her problems started around the end of September when she broke up with her boyfriend of three weeks. By her own admission, the relationship was never going to work because he desperately wants kids and she doesn't. That event started her downhill roll. Things have gradually been getting worse over the last few months.  

She moans about the lectures being ""fucking useless"" and lecturers being ""fucking idiots"" because they're not spoon feeding her like they did at college. She falls in to a state of great depression when her test scores (we do small tests online, 12 questions max) aren't as good as she'd hoped (her recent test she got 7/12) despite the fact the online tests barely mean anything to our final grades. She constant complains about the content of her course (she's studying Zoology and doesn't like having to start at the bottom). She's always missing lectures to go home frequently (we're not with commuting distance of home) and when she comes back she's as stroppy as ever. She's sleeping at erratic times and doesn't wake up for her alarm even though it wakes up me and everybody else above and below us. he's not eating properly and when she does it's usually at 10pm at night.

I can't cope anymore. I've begged for her to use the counselling service the university offers but she won't (she went as far as to tell me she had rang the counselling service and they outright said they wouldn't see her, which is a lie. They' have put her on a waiting list). She only wants me to listen to her moaning all of the time but it's getting me down now. I have a history of depression and I can't afford to let this throw me back in to it. I've also asked her if she really belongs here but she's said in a stroppy tone ""this is my only way to get in to the industry I like because I'm not a likeable person so I need the qualifications"".

I told my mom about but she brushed it off saying that nothings wrong and I just need to be more confident she told me people who need to see a therapist are really suffering like my aunt(she’s bipolar and she gets out of control sometimes we have to take her to the hospital) then she said I’m just being silly.

94,"For the past few years, I have been making a serious effort to try and identify what I'm afflicted with. I do not have access to a psychologist/therapist, and I have no intention of getting help that I'm sure some of you presume I need. 

Things go back and forth. Sometimes I can share what's going on and sometimes I can't, and sometimes it's just a bad day and everyone seems to think I'm crazy. I call those days Fubojad. It's Fuiboj if it's just a moment of instability. 

My purpose of making this post is to try and figure out if I am afflicted with Schizotypal disorder. I have been searching, searching, searching, and this seems to be one of many that pertain to my symptoms. 

You might know me from the now-locked posts about needing to be underestimated. 

Since I was young, I had dealt with odd delusions. I  lived in fear of the nighttime, because I could then see ""shadow people"", as I had called them; not any source I had contacted had had a reasonable explanation. I was thoroughly convinced that I had means of contacting gods or spirits or monsters, but it had all stopped when I had began seeing other things. It had begun as a game but I tricked my mind of out seeing it. There were huge black snails covered in slime and they were coming in through the roof of my bunk bed, (I had slept on the bottom) I could see the stalks of their eyes and it was just staring at me, the slime was falling on my body and it was also black then it was gone and I was crying and I couldn't move. That was a year ago.

Before then I had always been a loner, I struggled with anxiety and in my early years had illusions of grandeur, I believed that if I was hated and looked upon as less than that I could manipulate others into getting what I wanted. My Mother had threatened to bring me to therapy multiple times, and I had such an intense hate for therapists that I had always worked her mimd to believe that I shouldn't go. 

I take money and I take what I want. I struggled with keeping on what I called a Face, now I know it is called a mask. I had odd ways of coping that involved symbolic almost-rituals that I don't need to discuss. I take pride in appearing neurotypical and I take pride in looking so sweet and innocent, I looked three years younger than my real age! 

This post is Everything and Nothing and my mind isn't good today. This is a day after Fubojad and I am good right now and I can't remember things thag happened during a bad day when I'm not in the bad day anymore so I can't explain myself. 

I think that I am better than everyone else. There are Words that I use to describe that but I can't right now because that is very self-identifying and it took courage to post this. I struggled with sadistic things but we shouldn't talk about that, and I'm writing like a twelve-year-old because it feels like you took off my clothes and my Face and I have a feeling like I'm fucking insane because I just stepped back and reread that, what's wrong with me?",17Nov2019,1

Certain noises make me angry, I try to control it, but it's infuriating to the point where I want to break something, run away, or hurt someone. Stuff like high pitched voices or whispering do this, sometimes it's even silence.

I feel as though I am an observer, a spectator, nothing I see feels real, and I mean this in the most literal way possible. Everything down to the people I see feels fake, though I know it isn't. I feel that I'm not in control, I'm disconnected from myself and am an outside observer. Everything feels slow.

Relationships with the people around me are difficult to maintain, my way of being is never persistent, meaning I seem like completely different people from one day to the next.

Sometimes doing something in a particular way makes me feel like I have to do it again, it's like an itch that I can't scratch. Like if I switch on a light, sometimes I feel as though I have to switch it off and on again until I do it ""right"".

My hands and body shake a lot, even when I'm not nervous, though I am frequently nervous.

Sometimes I can't even walk in a straight line because my legs feel so weak, my body feels weaker than I think it should be.

Sometimes I can't pick up something or move something because I'm scared of messing up, I feel like everybody's watching me at all times. It makes me jolt and twitch sometimes, but I try to hide it.

Knives and sharp objects make me extremely nervous.

I have a good job with the possibility of a pay increase coming up soon too so the financial problems I do have should be going away soon.

I’ve noticed now that I’m slowly regressing, becoming less social, not wanting to leave the house except for work. I’m struggling to keep a good relationship with my fiancé now and I’m making her the enemy for some reason. Extremely irritable, always angry, and I do not know why. I’m not sure what my issue is, I’ve never been diagnosed with anything other then anxiety and depression but I almost wonder if something else is going on. Possible Bipolar. I’ve convinced myself before that I was bipolar but I feel like doctors had talked me out of feeling that way. Or rather made me think that wasn’t the actual issue. I don’t know where to begin to try and get help but I need to. I have to get better. I’m tired of living my life this way.",17Nov2019,1
105,"I’ve been having a really bad day mental health wise, my head has been constantly cycling the same thought of being useless and a detriment to other people and I tried to sort my head out a little by going for a walk.

I usually find somewhere to sit and think but head is deafening, my thoughts are so loud that I forget about the world around me and sometimes they come out verbally when I’m on my own.

I was on my way back and me and my brain were going through the same old “I’m worthless” “I’m stupid” “people don’t want you around” and they were so distracting and loud that by the time I realised where I was I was stood in the middle of a road near with a car angrily beeping at me in the way.

It’s difficult to explain how I got there, the obvious answer is I walked into the middle of the road while a car was coming but I don’t have the memory of even stepping off the kerb.

I’m not actively suicidal, I have had thoughts before about how people would be better off if I was to vanish, I don’t self harm anymore (used to punch myself in the face when I got to a certain level of being upset) but this was totally different. To me it felt like there was no conscious choice involved in my actions.

I’d ask for advice but I’m not even sure where to start there, I will book an appointment with my doctor as soon as I possibly can to talk it over with him, I am on 50mg of Sertraline daily but like I said today was a new development.",17Nov2019,1
106,"Around four months ago I (M19) started dating a girl in  my town around my age. I had dated other girls but this one was special. I was constantly thinking about her and could not wait to spend time with her. I think I was falling in love with her, and that hadn't happened to me before.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, whenever I did something for her, there were two reasons: to make her happy, and to make her miss me whenever we broke up. I would give her posters and presents to make her happy and so she remembered me whenever she entered her room and looked and those things. I was comprehensive and dealt with her mistakes and emotional breadowns (she's pretty sensitive to everything) because I loved her and because I wanted her to remember me when her next partner woulndn't deal with that. I usually lasted more than two hours in bed just so she would feel amazing and just so she missed me when another man doesn't last that long.

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out she was cheating on me with and ex of hers, and she was the one to told me so.

&amp;#x200B;

Usually when I start dating someone I think what will be my excuse to broke up and how would I act in different scenarios. And this time, I acted really, really calm and chill, because if you are really sorry about something, you feel even worse if the other person responds in a calm and understandable way instead of getting pissed. I said ""Ok, I need to think of this"" when she told me, and left her in her house. Afterwards I told her I wanted to broke up but would remain friends and told her to call me whenever she and her ex stopped seeing each other. She agreed.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently friends with her but I've made sure she knows this has hurted me a lot. When in reality, I think I was over it in a couple of days. I don't see her as a love interest anymore.

I am so obsessed with putting forth a perfect image of a human being to everyone. I know that no one is perfect but I can't help but have an internal battle every time I slip up and don't perform perfectly. 

It feels like there is a demon following me that makes me want to kill myself every time I make a mistake. ""why are you so stupid, why are you like this, why do you suck so much"". I want it to stop but I don't know how. Even though I have a 3.7/4.0GPA where most people think is good, I feel like throwing up every time I remember that I don't have a 4.0. My parents were strict only in my early childhood years but I failed a class in middle school and my mom said she doesn't care anymore because waiting for me to reach their expectations would only turn into disappointment.

I [21F] broke up with my boyfriend [21M] after 8 month relationship. We were very much in love, but it become toxic very soon and last 4 months we were pretty much on and off. He initiated all those breakups, but also all the makeups. He blamed me for having one past sexual partner and wanted to ""get even"" in terms of number of sexual encounters, as he was a virgin when we started dating. He even went so far as to suggest a threesome with my bestfriend (f)! He would doubt my love for him because of that and would say stuff like ""i'm only one of many to you"". We talked a lot about that and when we did he would become aggressive, not directly towards me, but would smash bottles, curse, etc. 
It's been 7 months since we broke up and I still struggle with my self-image. When I try to put myself out there and go on dates, I feel guilty and like he was right when he said he was just one of many, even though I know it is not true. I feel like I'm not able to have a relationship because of the image he created. 
Is there somebody else that has a similar problem and how do you deal with it?

132,"So with my issues I have noticed that my downs are essentially ""bookended"", for lack of a better term, by good moments.

You take the alphabet, its bookends are A and Z but B-Y is in the middle. My high points are A and Z and my downs are B-Y.

I have a good moment, a happy moment, or at least a positive moment, but once that is done then I go right back too my low. After A, every single time with out fail, comes B-Y. Yes, Z comes in the end but then the process starts all over again and that takes it's toll on a person.

I have started maybe dropping hints to people in work that I am not in a good place but for the most part that is met with laughter and amusement because for so long I pretended to be happy.

People just think its is a ""bad mood"" or a bad day but there is a difference between a bad mood and a miserable existence.

The past few days have been rough. The weight of University and my work are crushing me but that is only partly to blame for my misery.

When I said earlier after A comes B-Y, normally B is coming home.

My misery seems to be prolonged or heightened when I am in what is supposed to be the safety of my own home.

Maybe it is because my family don't care. Maybe it is because I don't want to talk to them about my problems. I mean imagine telling your mum that you are sad because of how lonely you are. The fact you have nobody to share your life with. To hug, to kiss, to love.

You can see why I keep it bottled inside. That and because she shouted at me because I ""Haven't been happy these past few days and she is sick off it"". She is sick of it? How does she think it feels to live your life with depression? If anyone should be suck of it, it should be me.

""That's life, deal with it"" is her unhelpful response to my clear mental illness.

No help at all really for a teenager looking for help but can't find it. She seems angry that I would even dare show any sign of distress, something you would expect from a harsh father figure. Perhaps making up for him being missing for so long in my life.

138,"I've been on holiday this week and found no joy in any of it. I was with friends and family and all I felt was empty and lonely and couldn't stop crying when I was on my own. I felt like everyone was in on the joke and hadn't told me the punchline.

Nothing I try makes me happy, I don't know what it means to be happy I don't know what it means to feel like someone wants to be with me. I don't have a connection with anyone, even my own children choose to be with other people rather than me.

How do I fix this?",17Nov2019,1
139,"I [28F] recently relocated to a new country and I am making new friends here (which has been hard). I lost most of my teens and 20's to depression and anxiety rooted in childhood abuse. I'm high functioning but I do have breakdowns over small things sometimes.

 Last week I really clicked with this girl. Wednesday will be our third meeting. We don't really text. I want to tell her about my anxiety issues and depressive episodes but it's very heavy stuff and I otherwise come off as quite vibrant and laid back. I don't want to scare her if/when I have a breakdown. 

Does anyone have advice how to bring up the subject? How long do I wait before I bring up something like that?",17Nov2019,1

141,"During the last couple of weeks, I've been able to manage better than for a long time. I've been able to advance my uni studies in a reasonable fashion by finding motivation to actually be interested in developing myself (and pushing myself towards eventual graduation), I've had the energy to participate in many interesting events and I've even started to cook myself now and then (to an increasing degree).

Despite my problems still being ever-present (that is, hard PTSD-induced anxiety attacks) I've still started to fully believe through this longer better period that I can still move onwards nonetheless - be it in any pace.

PS. The motivation might partially stem from me opening/""ranting"" about my issues to a good friend of mine some time ago, which effectively lifted somr pain of my shoulders.",17Nov2019,1

144,"I suffer from pretty bad depression and stress. One main thing I struggle with is staying on top of all the things I have to do at home because my depression saps my motivation and my stress makes me forget things and not be able to think straight. And then I feel like shit for not doing anything, and spend a week trying to do everything and not allowing myself to relax. I barely relax because I'm always worried about stuff I have to do. And then the stress causes me to not do things- it's a bad cycle and I'm sure a lot of others have this issue too. 

So I recently made a rota of all my housework as a starting point for getting better. I feel much better already and would recommend this to others who struggle to stay on top of things, or who overwork themselves (or both, like me). I'm still only a couple weeks in so time will tell, but I feel a lot less stressed about getting things done because I know that every night I can come home from work and see it written down and think, ""right well tonight I have to do this thing and this thing"". And then I don't have to worry about everything else I have to do, because I know it's scheduled for another day and WILL get done eventually. I'm stressing less about getting things done because I know that future me will do them, and it's less to think about and remember for someone who struggles to remember things and organise their mind. 

I've given myself two days of doing nothing too, so I know I have those two days to do whatever I want- relax or work on personal projects. And also it forces me to relax and stop worrying every once in a while.

I would recommend trying this if you struggle with getting things done or just find it too much to think about in a stressful life. It may seem childish to have a chore rota, but sometimes the best way to deal with things is to make it really simple and black and white. I know this is probably a really common thing so sorry for that, I just thought it might help some people.",17Nov2019,1
145,"Hello my lovely friends. I feel shallow emotionally sometimes, I want to know if I have the emotional emptiness or simply I do not have feelings. Also I am sadistic.

Describe me the emotional emptiness, and I will see if I can relate. Me:

My body is tired, I can be very sleepy. Usually I dont think too much, I can sleep and rest well then. My mood is a bit low, I dont have much energy. I dont feel guilt or remorse at all, its more like I do not care about things. Like I am not emotionally attached to things or people. Like I am not interested in anything particular at the moment. I have a very strong need for stimulation then. Because its debilitating boredom.

Thats it, it can last a couple of hours, sometimes 1-2 days. Some stimulation is enough to break that and I can be completely happy and energized. I can dance and laugh like an idiot very often.

I was calling these low moments ""emotional emptiness"" but recently one person said its not that.",17Nov2019,1
146,"Here's the gist:

Had a good friend (M19) , trusted him lots. Thought I (F19) was interested in him, then decided we were better off as friends. He was very pushy, touched my boobs in public, often commented about my appearance sexually, slapped my ass at work, told my high school teachers we were together. One night, at a playground, we were just hanging out, and goofing off. I was sitting on a short wall, and he came and pushed me down (playfully) and kissed me. I had told him I wasn't interested. Had an uncomfortable sexual encounter that followed that I played into because I was a bit worried (we were there alone at like 3 am). Followed up by re-stating my interests - that I wasn't interested in that with him.

Weeks later, I drive him home from a party. I'm looking at my lap, waiting for him to get out and go into his house. He kisses me. I ask to talk about it the next day, and he says no since we don't have the ""other benefits"" of an ""actual relationship"" (aka we dont have sex). Kept hanging out because he would ultimately apologize.

Told me best friend we had anal. We didn't even have sex.

Few months later, I visit him at school. Shouldn't have consumed so much alcohol, but I did. Before even having a sip, I told him that I did NOT want to hook up tonight, and he kept giggling and refilling my cup. He tried to kiss me at the party, I pulled away and reminded him of what I had said. We go back to go to sleep - I end up sleeping in his bed somehow. I think the other option was on the couch right next to his roommate's bed? He pushes me against the wall, tries to feel up my shirt, down my pants. I literally said the words ""No means no. Fuck off."" And he would squeeze me and apologize profusely. 30 seconds later, back at it. This continued until I fell asleep I guess? Don't remember.

Texted him this year and asked if we had sex. He said we made out. I have no memory of that but I was NOT blackout. Never have been.

Anyway, it still doesn't feel like it ""counts."" I work with sexual assault victims, and it always feels like their cases matter more. This felt good just typing. I hope someone can relate or find peace with this somehow.",17Nov2019,1
147,"Hi all, this is my first time posting but I’m in need of some help. For the past year or so I’ve been struggling with depression and some serious anxiety. I’ve learned how to deal with that, and how to cope with it and it has gotten significantly better. Recently, though, I’ve been getting some serious mood swings. Today I was in the car with one of my best buds, and I was doing great, honestly hadn’t felt that good for a while. Then suddenly I started complaining about not feeling appreciated, then complaining about how I’m selfish and that it makes no sense to me that people want to be friends with me because I always pull suit like that. Point is: it’s starting to get so bad I’m worried it’s going to effect friendships. Another instance was I was at a party, happy as can be and then suddenly more depressed than I’d been for a long time. I’m a 17 year old guy if that makes any dif, gives any context. I’m diagnosed with GAD, struggle with depression and overthink quite literally everything, and I’m scared it’s going to become detrimental to my friendships. Are there any coping methods that might help? I’m considering going to yoga and going to therapy again, I stopped going to therapy because I really didn’t like my guy and all of my sessions just felt repetitive and not like they were doing anything. 
I appreciate this community a lot, I haven’t been active in it but reading through it has helped me get through some stuff.

150,"Hello, thank you for reading this.

I am a male in my mid twenties. This is a throwaway account. I have a very demanding job, but it is the only thing I derive meaning from. I can function during working hours, but outside of work I feel like I am stuck in my own head and I am hanging by a thread.

I think this is the best place to ask for advice. These issues have worsened over the last three years. Here are the problems I am having trouble dealing with:

* Simple tasks are difficult to follow through on (eating, sleeping correctly, exercising etc). 
* My thoughts are bizarre and I cannot make sense of them. They are very abstract and frightening.
* I want to stop existing, but I cannot kill myself as my family will have to deal with the loss. So I will never kill myself.
* My movement and thought processing speed slow down considerably when I am not at work. 
   * Sometimes I feel like I have no control over my movements as I wander around my apartment. 
* I spend large amounts of time zoning out and not getting much done outside of work. 
   * Even at work, it is becoming difficult to organize my thoughts and concentrate. It is taking me longer to accomplish tasks, so I sacrifice my sleep and personal time to keep afloat.
* I cannot register emotions anymore. 
   * I can fake it when necessary but it is not real. I do not feel like a person anymore. I used to feel depressed, but now I feel almost nothing.
* I am very paranoid and I think I am about to get fired, but objectively I think this is not true as I still deliver the work.
   * I think my coworkers are starting to realize something is not right with me though.
* I have no social life or friends, but I do not have any urge to change that at the moment. 
   * This is because I know I am currently in no state to cultivate meaningful relationships and I need to improve my mental health first. 

Here are the things I am doing to fix this:

* I have booked a session with a therapist.
* I am trying to eat and sleep better. I am also trying to go to the gym regularly again but I rarely have the time or energy to consistently do so.
* I am making and following through on career-oriented plans so I have something to look forward to, but I fear that I will no longer be able to work if my symptoms become worse.

I have previously sought professional help for depression a few years ago. I was diagnosed with unipolar depression and I was prescribed an antipsychotic. I stopped taking them after two weeks as I was worried about the side effects. They impeded my ability to think clearly and understand complex ideas, which is required for work. 

I have been using work as a way to force myself to function. This worked initially, but I fear that this is no longer viable.

Has anyone dealt with similar issues? If so, do you know what the root cause was? Do you have any coping strategies? I think medication is not the way forward as I know I will be prescribed more antipsychotics, which seem to do more harm than good. I am not medically trained though so I may be wrong. 

Thank you.",17Nov2019,1
151,"At the beginning of university I became severely depressed for no apparent reason (would self harm, think of suicide, not be able to get out of bed, cry all day, etc.). Then I met my ex and he introduced me to the world of drugs. I have an extremely addictive personality. It felt like I could truly be happy again, we would be stoned literally all day everyday but what I loved most was MDMA. When we did molly together it was truly the best moments of my entire life. It got so bad that I dropped two semesters of school because all I did was get high and eventually because of the constant drug abuse (cocaine, molly, Xanax, weed, etc) we broke up because it destroyed our relationship in the end and if we were ever sober we hated each other. Right after the break up I met someone new who was able to help me stop doing drugs and I got through the withdrawals and moved on. This was three years ago.

I ended up graduating with honours, got a good job, bought a nice car, etc. I have awesome friends, my parents are super supportive and always have been (emotionally and money wise). I even quit cigarettes and weed. Currently I’ve moved back home because I broke up with the current boyfriend (long story short he did not treat me well) and I really started missing my ex that I did drugs with. I’ve never thought about him during these three years until now and it’s not like I miss him particularly, I miss the feelings I had with him on MDMA because like I said it was the happiest I could have possibly ever been and I relate those memories to being with him.

I am feeling extremely depressed now and do not want to work, do not want to do anything except MDMA which I know I shouldn’t do or else I will spiral back down to where I was three years ago. The problem is because I am so depressed I’ve been drinking bottles of vodka weekly, getting so wasted that I black out half the time because it is the only thing I have right now to make me stop wanting drugs and thinking about the good times with my ex because I feel like I will never be happy the way I was with him ever again so what is the point of life like this... alcohol is the only thing that numbs the reality of never having that pure serotonin of love and I’m scared I’m becoming an alcoholic as I already feel my health deteriorating.

I just don’t know what to do and how to stop drinking and how to move on knowing I will never feel the rush of MDMA again... I know that I have an amazing life now and I don’t want to destroy it again. Thank you for reading.",17Nov2019,1
152,"I'm 19 and have been diagnosed with health anxiety and a panic disorder. My main worry at the moment is schizophrenia. I've noticed that I sometimes hear sounds that aren't there when I'm falling asleep. I googled it and it seems like its a ""common"" experience (according to a study it's up to 70% of people who experience it, just can't recall it). However, I can't find anything about if it's linked to having schizophrenia or not and it's making me quite worried. I also have a history of derealization (I don't experience it anymore thankfully). Could this be a sign of schizophrenia in the future?

I'm sick of hearing people describing others as ""psycho"", and people they disagree with being called ""delusional"". It's so hard to exist as a psychotic person when we're so demonised and feared.

155,"I have ability to affect on other people a lot i can easily control or earn them but lately i am trying to harm them.

I am pushing people to suicide,fail tests even isolating and triggering their anxiety or stress. 
The main problem is:
“The affect i have on people” when i think about it,that just sounds so wrong but then why is it fun? It is the first time i am proud of manipulating.
I was taking treatment for my antisocial personality disorder i suffered about accepting the disaster and treatment but I don’t want it anymore i was a kid back then and they tricked me to take treatment. It is making me sleep a lot i am less productive it is just harming me. What i do is not wrong why do I have to take it? Makes no sense. If i have “this affect” on others it is because their personality is weak not because i am the bad one,right? By that i even prepare them to the harsh society,right? I feel so empty it is like my chest has a hole inside and only way to fill it is success and power. The more i have the more i feel alive. How can i stop treatments?

I don’t really know why I’m like this but it’s just difficult.

165,"I've been in denial about my anxiety until early this year when I finally had to come to terms with the fact that my brain just isn't normal. I've always been anxious but the past few months just feel like I'm mentally unraveling even though everything in my life is fine.

I had my first panic attack at a baby shower today for my sister-in-law, who I'm very close to. I knew mostly everyone there and was with my husband too, so it wasn't a stressful situation, but when we got there something in my brain flipped and I started feeling tingly and anxious as if I was going to cry at any moment.

I finally excused myself to the bathroom and gave myself seven minutes to cry quietly in the floor, fix my makeup, wait for my eyes to stop being red, and get back out to the party even though I was still shaking. My head's been fuzzy since then and I still feel like I could cry for hours. My anxiety has never been this intense, but I don't know why it's spiraling so badly now. I just feel like I'm either overreacting or going crazy.

I want to see a therapist and maybe try medication, but I grew up with a narcissistic mom who drilled it into our heads that anxiety and depression weren't real or were demonic, and though I know better now, it's hard to break that cycle of shame.

166,"This is probably going to be a long text so prepare.

I‘m a 17 year old guy who has had an alcoholic mom for from 11 until a few months ago, I firstly suspect that I suffer from depression but most importantly I noticed that since I was always given the responsibility to keep my mothers alcoholism from my friends, teachers etc. from a very young age it always made me subconsciously choose my words wisely because if I‘d let something slip I would blame myself for being ""stupid"" and after I lost my apprenticeship because I always told my boss that everything was okay although nothing was okay and kept and finally about 5 months ago I told my dad that I need help and surprisingly he instantly called an old friend of his who is a psychiatrist and after some time I started to feel better and ultimately I was able to forgive myself for blaming everything on me and never actually seeing that I was never the one to blame.

I got into a school to bridge the year between now and september when we’ll all head our ways. The most important thing is that this is the first time I experienced friendship in a class because I was pretty much always bullied my entire life and this place showed me that there is more than just hating everyone and just wanting to leave the house, I also for the second time ever had alot of contact with girls which baffled me because I‘ve always seen myself as worthless, unlikable, unlovable, ugly and stupid
But this class made me feel again, I feel genuine joy when I see my classmates and I‘m so incredibly grateful for these friendships.

Eversince I spoke out about my shitty past I got better at talking being more open, especially with strangers(I‘m socially anxious and introverted too) and 2 weeks ago 3 girls from class invited me to eat mushrooms with them. We had a really good time and I‘m pretty sure I fell in love with a girl that was there and is also in my class, but I dont really know since I lived in sadness for so long that I don’t know what love feels like anymore, 

now for my problem; The girls wanted to talk about my past but I noticed that as soon as they asked this it felt like I had barrier that preventing me from speaking about my feelings and just said something to avoid the questions at all costs. And I feel like this is the scar my past has left in my head, does anyone know some tips to heal this?
I do plan on taking a psychedelic by myself for spiritual healing which I hope will help
