0,"so I've been feeling just empty for a couple months now and like I don't care about other people at all. I have a bf who is very affectionate and I am to an extent bc I'm sorta afraid of affection, I just feel bad bc sometimes I'm really dry towards him bc the emptiness will get even worse in spurts. he's been very supportive about it and caring but I just don't feel anything. it's kinda like a sad but also like literally nothing. kinda like if I died it would be fine but I'm not actively trying to die. I don't know what's wrong, it's been ok here ig recently, could anyone point me in any kind of direction?",03Dec2019,1
1,"Ever since this started happening several months ago, I've been so afraid to even talk about it, so this is my first time really going into detail.

Some background info - I've suffered with depression and anxiety for around a decade, diagnosed around 3-4 years ago along with panic disorder, meaning I have frequent and panic attacks that can happen for no reason, but also be easily triggered when there is a reason behind it. I also used to be suicidal mainly due to being stuck in an awful abusive home situation, but when I moved in with my partner around 2 months before this incident, I was recovering well and was actually happy to be alive.

Around mid-August I was on a trip with my partner and his family. On the last night, we had been drinking a little (nothing excessive, at most I was mildly tipsy) and looking up at the stars talking about the stars and the universe since it interests both of us (or at least did). Suddenly, I get this horrible feeling in my chest. Eyes widened, tightened grip on his arm, and heavy breathing, repeating ""I don't want to die"" over and over. 

Now it's probably worth mentioning that I had a severe fear of dying when I was around 13/14 which stopped me from being able to sleep at night, every night, for about 2 years. I pretty much had to exhaust myself and essentially pass out or sleep as soon as I got home from school so that it was still light outside and then stay up throughout the night. I eventually got over this and hadn't thought about it since.

Anyway, after this happened my partner got me back to our room and calmed me down the best he could, but that night I struggled to sleep. I thought I would be over it once the week passed but that was over 3 months ago. Every single day for the next 6 weeks my mind was flooded with thoughts of dying and death and the unknown. I would often space out thinking about it and it pretty much took over my life. Sleeping became an issue again as I HAD to have a lamp on or music playing, which isn't ideal as I'm sharing a room now. I also don't know how to explain it, but things have felt ""off"" since then, like nothing feels quite the way it should and the whole concept of existing in the first place seems impossible. 

For the past month it hasn't been as bad, but I still think about it daily. I've become obsessed with watching videos detailing real-life horror stories from doctors, EMT's, ect. These being centered around death both seem to soothe and frighten me, which I don't understand but it seems to be helping somewhat I think? 

I know a lot of people are afraid of dying, so I'm wondering if this episode is a normal thing to experience, particularly to those who have a history of mental illness, or whether it's some form or OCD?

This was mainly just a way for me to vent, bit of anyone has advice or similar experiences that would be helpful. I made a referral to a therapist a few weeks ago and still haven't heard anything back so I plan to see my GP after Christmas for other options.",03Dec2019,1

5,"I am a 21 year old male.  I can't stop thinking about different types of things but all of them are self centered thoughts which make me feel sure that i am 100%  a covert narcissist. Whenever i listen to music i start to imagine myself playing the song that i am listening to live for a large crowd. I feel like crap whenever i receive criticism and tend to feel a lot of anger and shame, i promise myself without apologizing that i won't make that mistake again an than repeating it over and over due to how distracted and how quick i forget things. I do not trust others and i barely have a close friend who no longer live at the state that i live. I have this weird tendency to look myself in the mirror and then have all this thoughts about how i am a narcissist,  a few days ago i covered the mirror that is in my room with my towel so i stop myself from doing those things.  I dropout of college due to the fear of criticism because of my age since i started late but also wasn't performing very well, since then i don't tell anyone that i'm getting to know that i don't go to college due to that fact that i am a community college dropout who started college at 20. I joined a coding boot camp later on where i performed fairly well and I've been trying to improve the skills that i was taught there to get a job. I  was kinda bullied as both a kid and a teenager and i constantly have these thoughts about revenge on my bullies. I like to think that i am special and i hate to do things that others do so that can reinforce that feeling. I use to do pixel art but stopped and lost interest because someone insinuated that i was a sellout when i mentioned to them that i was learning programming. I was always the shortest guy in the class and didn't hit puberty till the end of 16 where i grew up to 175 cm tall and then kept growing till i hit my current height 179.5 cm tall which i believe it has something to do with my obsession with my height and if a am tall enough . When i moved out of my country i slowly started to realize that i have become slightly attractive and i often overgeneralize by thinking that any friendly girl must find me attractive and when a guy is being mean he's jealous of me. I very shy and introverted since i am a foreigner i hate to receive calls or start conversations due to my fear of making mistakes when talking English, for that i often mumble or talk very quietly. I met a girl who is the daughter of an ex coworker of my dad who i believed was flirting with me and ever since then i can't stop thinking about  her true motives  and I've stalked her social media. I am a people pleaser and some people might think that i am a good person but deep down i am very cruel and judgmental person.",03Dec2019,1
6,"I am working on a report for my mental health class, and basically, we had to create a case study about a youth with a specific mental illness, and proceed to describe an informal and then a formal intervention strategy for the individual.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the case study

&amp;#x200B;

Tyler is a 15 year old boy who has Schizophrenia. Tyler experiences hallucinations, extreme delusions, disorganized speech and thinking, and struggles to maintain his personal hygiene. While he seemed to have some close friends in elementary school, he became socially withdrawn when he started high school, and has struggled to make friends for the last year or so. When Tyler does happen to make new friends, he struggles to keep them.

At home, Tyler rarely focuses on the homework he is given by his teachers, and spends hours on YouTube and online discussion forums that discuss bizarre, and highly unlikely government conspiracy theories. Sometimes, Tyler will go on weekend binges and hardly leave his computer chair to use the washroom, bathe, eat, or sleep to indulge in these extreme conspiracy theories, many of which he comes up with on his own. Despite their unlikeliness, he is convinced they are absolutely real. Because of his fixation on these delusional theories, his grades have been suffering considerably. Tyler spends such a large portion of his time on these conspiracy theories that he struggles to concentrate in class as well. The conspiracies have only been ongoing for the past 8 or 9 months.

Lately, Tyler will express extreme discomfort while in class, claiming he smells a sour gas that burns his nostrils. He tells his classmates and his teacher that the government is pumping “mind control gases” into the classroom through the school’s ventilation system, and claims that these gases are the reason for his poor performance in school lately because the “government is trying to ‘dumb down’ its youth”. He is the only one who smells these seemingly powerful gases. He has only been complaining of these gases for the past two months or so, which has been of increasing concern to staff in the school, as well as his classmates. Each time Tyler reacts to the gas in the classroom (usually 3-5 times a month, and steadily increasing) it results in him having to be removed from the class, another reason for his dwindling grades.

Tyler’s family has always just thought of Tyler as a shy, imaginative teen, wrapped up in too much YouTube, however his parents are beginning to become worried he may have Schizophrenia as his symptoms steadily increase over the past year. His father is especially worried since his brother (Tyler’s uncle) was diagnosed with Schizophrenia as a teenager many years ago, and Tyler’s symptoms seem to almost mirror his uncle’s.

&amp;#x200B;

The questions I must answer in regards to this are

&amp;#x200B;

1. Propose an informal intervention(s) that might be appropriate for this individual based on their symptomology and or diagnosis. (3-5 paragraphs). Tell me how the intervention is connected to the symptomology or risk associated with the Mental health Issues.
2. Propose a formal evidence-based intervention that promotes positive change and healthy development      (look to the journals for programs – it cannot be one in your text book.) Remember the intervention must be within our CYW scope of practice. (4-6 paragraphs)
3. Propose a community service for the mental health issue at a local level (Simcoe County). Provide a link to this service and annotate the source to tell me about how you came to this source, what it’s about? and why would you recommend it! (3-6 paragraphs)

I was scared he would try to do something else to hurt himself so I called 911. The next thing I knew he was being mental health arrested but that's not what I wanted at all. As he was being put in cuffs he told my mom they were getting a divorce. I don't know if I did the right thing or not. I don't want him to die but now he hates me and my mom.

18,"This is my story in the best way I can word it right now. I suffer from depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder and body dysmorphia. It started when I was in the 11th grade, my mental health began to decline and I failed science and math. I was given the option to go to summer school for the credit, but didn’t go due to anxiety. The next school year was dreadful, and I ended up dropping out halfway through the school year. School has never been my thing, and I reached my breaking point with all my mental health issues. Ive tried every medication and been to countless therapists, psychiatrists and councillors. I’ve spend the last 8 months trying to find a job, but nobody will hire me, I tried starting my own clothing brand, which ultimately flopped, I haven’t been able to get back to school to finish my education. Over the past year I’ve gained 70lbs, probably because I lost all passion for my hobbies. I barely play hockey anymore, I don’t play soccer anymore, I barely skateboard anymore, I haven’t touched my dirt bike in months, and I don’t go to the gym anymore. I hate my body and the way I look. My mental state became so bad that my family tried to take me on vacation for a week to relax, however, one of our flights got cancelled and we had to fly back home the next day. On top of all this, my father suffered a heart attack earlier in the year and has been in poor health, my grandmother is suffering from dementia and frequently forgets my name.

19,"Hey there, Reddit!

This post will be a glimpse into 23 years and counting, of dealing with a demon that I have come to recognize as 'ADHD.'

Like every good Redditor, I looked into the basic societal rules of interacting with the vast Redditsphere. One thing I am known for and something I am looking to avoid off the bat in my first post, is making sure I convey my story, but in a cohesive and concise manner. Cohesive and concise are two words that have never ended up making their way to my vocabulary, but alas, here we try..

Background:

\- 6' 2"" 250 lbs caucasian male

\- 23 years old

\- Graduated college in 2018

\- Working full time in a standard, high paced, 9 AM - 5 PM job

\- Diagnosed for the first time with OCD/ ADHD in 2014.

\*\* The following blurb is meant to be a general guided tour through my progression with ADHD and provide a lens into the sickening journey this little ""glitch"" in my head, has become \*\*

In 2014, I was. diagnosed with OCD and ADHD from a doctor who had as much care for their clients as two strangers do in passing. After a 10 question quiz and a few questions, off I was to little did I know, the ultimate tailspin of my life. See, ever since I was a child, my parents could have told you that I was different in some regard. From shuffling my feet every 10 minutes or when I stepped on a crack in the sidewalk, to twitching my head 3 times in a row furiously in what seemed like 2 hour increments, or even the pestering of my parents if the thing or surface I touched was going to make me sick if I were touch my tongue to my hand three times, muttering the noise, ""eh eh eh,"" it was clear that there was something in me slowly making itself noticed.

Fast forward to 2014 when I finally got diagnosed. What finally got me in the patient chair in that douche of a doctor's office, was the constant battle I was having in my own head. Every time I watched a YouTube video, or browsed over someone's social media content that I knew, I convinced myself that I had posted something there that would get either myself or my family in trouble. It haunted me. I had to back track every single time to the precise moment I had imprinted in my head when the ""crime"" was committed. I had to brush my tongue at night 7 times in a row while thinking of the number 7 and if for whatever reason I visualized the number 6, I was convinced that someone I knew was going to die as result. The best one was having to kiss my childhood dog's ashes 7 times in a row while muttering the same prayer over and over in my head until I was able to confidently visualize the number 7 in my head. Again, if 6 came to play, I would be in for a long evening.. Years of this continuous battle is what prompted me to seek help and lay the next stepping stone to this story.

With this diagnosis came the luxuries of starting my own medication regiment. This first comprised of Fluvoxamine for my OCD and Addy + Vyvanse for my ADHD. Lets say I enjoyed the high of my ADHD medication a little too much along with the added benefits that come on the side. Raised grades, profound focus and energy, lost weight.. it was magical. I loved every bit of it. This came to a halt after 2 years when I decided to stop taking all of my medication altogether because I felt ""normal again."" Sike.. welcome to college G. After a two year hiatus from taking medication, college came and immediately triggered the same mental tug-a-war that I was playing just two years ago. Alas, I started my regiment again under the same doctor. Except this time, I had found a way to get myself dependent on chewing tobacco and smoked weed fairly often.

College came and I found the same magical benefits from the ADHD medication that I did when I first started it. Addy combined with nicotine and being able to smoke myself to sleep at night after raking in the benefits during the day? Sounds like a healthy lifestyle to me. My self medicating of the Addy started shortly after my first year in college, taking upwards of 100 mg a day. When I would run out, I stole from dorm mates and friends and becoming very clever with my alibi's. With an increase in my addy came an increase in my chewing tobacco, and thus an increase in the amount of weed I smoked. This trend carried on for the remainder of college, leaving me to where I am today.

I have since started taking Abilify and Chlomipramine in conjunction with Addy and Vyvanse since seeing a new doctor in 2018 when I first started work. I have been diagnosed with major anxiety, depression, ADHD and OCD. I still smoke every night to fall asleep, a habit I have had for 3 years now consistently. I cannot tell you the last time I didn't smoke at night. I run through a month supply of Addy and Vyvanse in one week and have taken to coworkers to buy from here and there when I need a fix or they make it available. I also ""Chew"" one can of Zyn nicotine pouches a day while also drinking the same Starbucks ""double shot"" energy drink every morning, a recent relationship with caffeine that developed in the last year while trying to compensate for the days I didn't have my ""speed"" at my disposal.

I know this is a lot. Jumbled and sporadic to say the least. But this is the outline to a journey that I am having a harder and harder time keeping up with each day. My life seems to be one fixed routine that I am afraid to modify in the slightest. I can go on for hours about what I have been experiencing and my thoughts on it, but I need help from you all with questions, comments, and stories of your own. I KNOW I can relate to each of you and share the love we have for this demon together, but I fear that if I continue writing, this will turn into a 30 page ramble.

All comments are welcomed :)

22,"My parents divorced almost a decade ago because my dad fell in love with another woman. Everything was fine until like 3 or 4 years ago. My mom has gotten the idea that my dad is after her to kill her. She always thought that my dad planted cameras and microphones in our house cause she said that he would say to her things that it was impossible for him to know, and tracking devices in our car cause he would call us when we went out. She prohibited him from coming anywhere near the house  and i started seeing him less after that. I was obligated to sell my first car a year before i would finish paying off my car cause she believed that it had a tracking device and that my dad purposely did something to it so it would break down. she would force me to always have two phones cause she thinks that my dad could spy on our calls if i called them both from the same phone. She went to lawyers and to a woman’s center looking to get him in trouble. (They ended up sending us to therapy, I was almost removed from our home but  then she began to think that they where in it too) she always said that people would follow her and try to run her over and kill her when she was by herself outside, but nothing ever happens when in with her and sometimes she would see “suspicious people” when she’s with me but i never saw them. She moved to Florida with my aunts and left me here. Everything was fine and our relationship improved. But everything went to shit cause she thought that my aunts and cousins were stealing from her(i would always find what ever was stolen hidden somewhere in the room) she basically got thrown out of the house for being too problematic. She came back and everything got worse. She always mad eme believe that my dad was a horrible person, and that he didn’t care about me at all. He wasn’t the best on the first years of their divorce but he changed a couple of hears after. He would always call me and provide child support on time. Even now that im 21 he still helps me with college and basic expenses (gas, food, health care) but now that he’s 95% back in my life my mom has gotten worse, she’s constantly threatening me with sending him to jail, and the idea of that fucks me up mentally, she’s always telling me to “forget about him” because he doesn’t care about me cause he doesn’t love anyone, she also always tries to knock everything he does for me down, as if its not because he cares that he does those things. Or she acts like i only have a relationship with him because of his money.  She’s constantly bugging me about leaving him, like ghosting him. Now she wants to sell this car too cause she thinks it has a tracking device, im 2 years away from paying this one off.  She basically wants me to drop out of college and get a job so i don’t have depend on him anymore.(she never worked, he has always paid for everything) i get so annoyed with her when she starts speculating about ANYONE, the new plumber, the guy who fixes fridges, the cashier at cvs, randoms at Walmart, our family, our neighbors, ANYONE. But i also feel bad cause idk if this is real, my dad has never shown any violent sings towards me or her, she even admits that he was never physically violent towards her or me. And he is always asking me about her, if she’s ok, if she’s content, if she’s fighting with me too much cause he know how she is, if her health is ok cause she has a lot  of health problems etc.  My aunts even told me once that since my mom was a child she was very hostile and “jealous” and mean  like she was never fully there.  She always tells me that my dad is a horrible human being, a delinquent etc but he just looks and acts like a normal contractor. Should i be worried about my moms mental health?",03Dec2019,1
23,"We’re both in our early 20s, away at college. His depressive symptoms have been getting worse over the past week. Thankfully he is quite open about his symptoms, and lets us know when he is struggling, and I try to be there for him as much as possible, but sometimes I really don’t know what to say. I feel like I am not qualified or experienced enough to give him advice, but I want him to know that I’m there for him. 

When a person with depression tells you about one of their symptoms (e.g. nightmares, or very low moods), what can I say to help? Or just be there? 

I’ve dealt with social anxiety myself so I know how big of a deal it is to tell your friends that you aren’t ok. And I also know how meaningful a friends support is. But I really don’t know how to navigate this as the friend rather than sufferer.

I break things constantly; gaming controllers, furniture, I rip clothing, I break my phone constantly so I never buy nice ones, TVs, and most recently my Nintendo switch was ripped in two.

I'm not sure if this is the right place to put this, but I suspect they might be influenced by my SAD(seasonal affective disorder) ad depression, but they've had a sudden onset. Does anyone have any ideas of what to do?",03Dec2019,1
29,"I was looking back at some of my past Reddit posts because I haven't been on here in a while. I was scrolling through my profile and found that I was posting on this particular subreddit around 7 or 8 months ago. I was very lost then. I was extremely turned around and I had no idea what was making me feel the way I was feeling. Turns out, it was the one thing that I didn't expect that was making me feel that way. I had severe anxiety about my significant other. After breaking it off with her exactly 6 months ago, I can tell you that there is nothing like this feeling. I have some leftover scars from the awful things that she did and said to me but I can tell you that I made the experience worth it. I learned so much not only about myself, but also about others and the world around me. Everything seems clear now. Everything is fantastic and I'm living my life and having fun again. This is a post to promote. I don't want you to congratulate me on my achievement but instead, I want you to turn to somebody who you know needs help. If you're looking for a sign to help someone or help yourself, this is it my friend. The most valuable thing that anyone can ever lend you is perspective. This way, you have more ways to attack your problems and more likely to find the solution to those problems. It cannot be understated how important your path in life is. You are going through this because it will make you a stronger person when you come out of it. I feel more secure in my own value, I have more assurance that I am a good person, and I have more confidence in my ability to crush any obstacle I face whether that be physical, emotional, or mental. Be safe my friends, and help each other. Talk to each other, talk to your parents, talk to your friends, talk to your religious leaders, talk to anyone and everyone about your issue. Believe me, the silence doesn't solve the issue, it just makes the pain last longer. You got this. I believe in you.",03Dec2019,1
30,"Earlier this year I experimented with thc. However I carelessly took more than my body could handle and I think it triggered something. I had a paranoid episode as I was stressed and under the influence of it. That was the last time I used it too. So.. a couple weeks after, i had an episode in school. 

It started because when going over my Psyc unit about mental illnesses, I got scared that I probably had one,  then suddenly I became extremely paranoid, lost any touch sensations, and my head felt light. I convinced myself I was going crazy, and Had thoughts like I was too “woke” to life. That life is just meaningless because we just live till we die and nothing matters no matter what we do in our lifetime. I was trying to avoid making a scene in class so after the bell rang, I rushed to the lunch hoping eating and talking to my friends would distract me but it just kept getting worse. So I ran to the bathroom to cry and drink water.( from my water bottle) I think being dehydrated was a huge factor in this too. This episode lasted about an hour and I eventually calmed down. 

Then in June-ish I had another episode at my grandparents house. I quickly went to the basement bathroom and started doing the same things as before. Crying, feeling like I’m losing my mind.. but this time my mind was trying to convince me that if I’m going this crazy and life is meaningless, I should kill myself. 

I haven’t had it since then but I can sometimes feel it coming when I think about it. What is this??",03Dec2019,1
31,"This is something that I have struggled with for years; I have constantly been going back and forth between the idea of depression and the idea that I am just being dramatic and searching for attention. I find it hard to control my emotions sometimes, crying or getting angry over the tiniest, stupidest things. On the other hand, I also try (and often succeed) to always be smiling and laugh at the stupidest things. I often smile even when I feel like shit.

I struggled through it a lot through high school, ignoring it. The idea that I am just being dramatic is was kept me from reaching out to anyone about it. 

But then two years ago, my father passed away, and it destroyed me. I cried constantly. Never did anything but sleep. My grades plummeted. I considered suicide almost every other day. My father and I were not close, but the day he passed, was the same day I talked to my mom about restoring our relationship (we did not know he had already passed at the time). That is what mentally destroyed me.

Time has passed and I eventually rebuilt myself, but then I went to college. I made knew friends who completely stabbed me in the back (twice with two different groups of friends). I have always struggled to make friends, and now that just makes trusting the people who claim to care for me harder. It got to the point that I swallowed a bottle of pills last year, but fortunately, I involuntarily threw them up and no one knew about it.

I don't know what to do and I am afraid of who to trust. So anonymously posting on the internet for help seemed like my best option. I know I am better than I was, but I cannot tell if it is all in my head or not. Was swallowing the pills just a cry for attention that I realized the ridiculousness of, or a legit attempt? Why am I the bitchiest person I know? How can I go from cloud 9 to full blown ugly crying in two minutes?

I legitimately do not know what to do. Someone please help.",03Dec2019,1
32,"  

I feel like my life is becoming more of a nightmare with each passing week. It’s the same thing repeated over and over and nothing I do or tell myself, plans I make seem to materialize. I am a functioning alcoholic(weekend warrior for the most part) with a cocaine habit, not sure if its just the winter but things are getting worse. The days are just so fucking dark. I spent last Monday doing cocaine and drinking all day while in work, That night I kept the party going and bought some acid and ate them, the dose was too strong and I sat brain dead in my attic nearly catatonic for a few hours. Near the end I got a nervous twitch and waved my head around blinking my eyes making a clicking sound, I injured my already weakened jaw muscles which has resulted in a severe muscle issues some two weeks later. I woke up after my trip for work at 8 am, I stuck my head out my attic window and could have sworn I was tripping still, the sight outside was so just so  miserable it seemed surreal to me. The rain splattered my face as soon as the window was open an inch, the wind howled and I could hear sirens off in the distance. How is someone meant to stay sane waking up to such a miserable site every morning, and then doing it with any sort of hangover multiplies the misery by 100. I don’t remember being so effected by the winters in previous years, of course they were never my favorite time of the year but I find myself lower and lower every new winter. I did something to my jaw and have spent the last few days in bed on codeine occasionally getting a stinging pain in my jaw so intense that it makes me cry and roll around the bed in pain. I think about the rotten life I have built for myself and it makes me emotional. I feel so trapped. I am nearly 32 and still live with my parents. My mother is dieing of cancer and my father is an alcoholic, I am sandwiched in between both their separate bedrooms and am in the middle of all their arguing and fighting with each other. My father drinks any time my mother goes away, he sits in the living room with a cum stained smelly blanket draped over him while he drinks cider and occasionally comes out to me and my daughter in the dining room and slurs some love buzz drunken nonsense at us, annoys my daughter by trying to take what ever she is playing with off her saying ‘this is mine’, it seems to be the only way he can communicate with her, I see myself in Him I have no doubt the man will die miserable. He is also loosing his memory. Working from home means I am in the house near 24 hours a day. My social life includes drinking and doing coke with my two equally miserable and alcohol/cocaine dependent friends. I have no idea how to get a woman when you live with your parents at 32, and if you think single mothers have it hard in life, try being a full time single dad, even if I had a woman interested in me I would not have anytime to spend with them. My daughters mother is a suicidal bi polar person with no family of friends of her own to rely on, the child is scared of her so I am essentially a full time parent taking my daughter at least 4 nights a week. I used to be able to get to the gym during the week but I either am not motivated or I don have the evening free.  I if I want to move out of my parents house I need to save enough for a house, which is essentially a giant pipe dream in this country with the price of houses currently, or go into rental and pay at least 2 grand a month, the vast majority of my paycheck to a landlord. Usually the thought of Christmas cheers me up but Im just dreading it because it will just be a long session with horrible hangovers, cocaine binges, putting on a brave face with the  kid acting not hungover as I go to the park with her/go to family events/ ect.. I have stopped lieing to myself, I say Im going to have a dry month every month but every time I still end up at the off licence on Friday night, and it always ends with me waking up on Monday to the rain and the fucking wind and the miserable hung over tired and fed up Monday morning routine as I get my kid ready for school and sit in for a struggle of a day trying to get any resemblance of work done. I would never kill myself, and I don’t have depression, im just fucking sick of this life I have built for myself. I was going to go to counseling but honestly, the idea of paying someone 80 euro to pretend to care about your problems seems ridiculous to me( no offence intended here to anyone who it works for). Living in Ireland its nearly impossible to avoid alcohol, its every where, every event in life comes with alcohol. I know how it works with addiction, 95% of people never solve their issues and just live long lives of intermittent misery, they don’t achieve anything of any importance, they live quite lives of desperation. I might try an AA meeting, but honestly I don’t even want to give up alcohol, I have no idea what I would do without it, other than my daughter it’s the only thing I get happiness from. I used to like making music and dreamt of it being a profession, but like everything else I don’t have time, and also my ears are fucked from years of abuse, so even if I did have the time I probably shouldn’t be doing it unless I want to go deaf, wouldn’t that be a fucking shit cherry on top of it all.  I zone out and talk shit with my friends for a few hours every weekend and feel great and full of conversation thanks to the cocaine and booze. I have a job that is pretty easy, but I get no satisfaction from it. I would absolutely hate to go back to college, so I am stuck with the field I have chosen. My daughter is an only child, she will grow up dysfunctional im sure, she will not have any family really after the grand parents and we are gone,she will be alone in the cold dark irish winters, she has inherited her looks from me with my weak chin and bug eyes, so I doubt she will be very good looking when she is older. I know what the world is like for ugly people, I am an extremely ugly man, and I know its worse for women, especially now a days with Instagram and all that shite. She is beautiful to me, and the cutest kid in my eyes, but everyone says she has all my features which is not going to work out when she is a grown woman.  The world is going to start crumbling soon if the scientists are correct, migrant hoards ect, food shortages. I just wish I had a time machine.",03Dec2019,1
34,I don’t know why but i am so mean to people when i meet them for the first time. I am sarcastic and snarky. I have had people I am just getting to know ask me “why are you always so mean to me”. Then i feel bad because am not trying to be and I have nothing against them and I’m normally really nice. Sometimes I will just bring in grocery size bags of candy and give it to all my friends. Whenever my friends need something I will do it no matter what and they can always lay all their problems on me and I’ll take it. But then when someone new tries talking to me I shut down and am as rude as possible and i’m not sure why i have such conflicting personalities. I know this isn’t the best sub reddit but it’s my favorite and it links close enough. I just feel like (almost) everyone here is nice and supportive of each other. I am sorry that this doesn’t exactly relate to mental health but if anyone has any advice/reasons why I do this that would be so helpful. Thanks!,03Dec2019,1
35,"Alright so I'm 16 and I live in NY so it's very snowy around this time of year. I've been physically sick for the past couple days, I haven't been eating because I'm worried im gonna throw it up and not eating is only I thing I do when I'm sick it's not like Its a disorder I have, I've been sleeping for at least half the day and I've been having fever dreams the past two nights. my mom's been taking very good care of me. So today she came into my room at about 7:45pm and asked me if I'm up to shovel the driveway because she had an appointment in the morning and needed the snow gone so she could get out of the driveway and to take out the trash so I figured I'd give it a shot so I went out and I just couldn't continue shoveling after about 20 minutes so I came back inside and I told her I needed to lie down and apparently she told me it's ok and that she'd cancel her appointment and all she needed me to do was take the trash out but the thing is I barely remember that, I remember taking a nap but when I woke up I was completely out of it, I don't do any drugs or drink whatsoever. So anyways I walked outside with no jacket and no shoes whatsoever with just socks on in the cold snow up to my upper shins (also keep in mind this part is a very vague memory) so for some reason I was running in the road thinking I was invincible and a car bumped me because 8 think I was trying to run into it and thats when I think I snapped out of whatever weird state I was in except at that point I think I was in shock so I then ran about a mile with no shoes or jacket in cold new York snowy weather to a gas station and I called my girlfriend on the way because I checked my phone at one point and she was the first notification I saw so I told her what happened and she freaked out and told her parents to come pick me up at the gas station. At this point I was starting to think more clearly and my mom was very reasonably upset because she thought that I had just gone outside to take out the trash and the next thing you know she's getting a call from my girlfriends parents telling her I'm about a mile away with no shoes or jacket at 9 pm in an area that's not so great so long story short her parents pick me up and try to figure out what's wrong with me but the thing is I have no clue. When I get home my mom wants to know the same and is telling me im grounded until I can tell her why I just did all of this crazy shit for no reason which I think is reasonable but at the same time I DONT KNOW WHY and I was just wondering if someone here either a professional or someone educated in this area could tell me why I completely lost my brain and seemed to have what I can only call an episode. Also for the record I'm not ever like this with the running in the street thinking I'm invincible. I just wanna know what's wrong with me.",03Dec2019,1
36,"Several years ago I was about to have a son.  About a month before he was born I was raped by a man.  After it happened I was luckily able to get some sweet revenge (a severe beating from me when the drug wore off and I realized what happened.).   

I tried to hide what happened from my family but ultimately I think it just took a toll on me mentally.  I've been diagnosed with ADHD PTSD anxiety depression and bipolar both before and after this incident.  I feel like I have developed a bit of a personality disorder since then and I ended up blowing up my relationship with my sons mom.

I've been able to salvage the relationship enough to be able to coparent or at least parrallel parent my son without a custody agreement but I really dont know where to go now.  Maybe I should try going back on medication but I've hated all the pills I've tried.   It's been getting to the point where it really impacts my ability to work and I think I need to do something relatively soon because I'm tired of starting over.

Does anyone have any experience with the new brain scans?  Do they work, any positive or negative experiences would be appreciated.

37,My support system for the past year has been my now ex-boyfriend (we are still friends) and his ex girlfriend (also my friend). Me and my ex were acting like a couple without a label since we broke up but things changed. But I can’t keep running to them when my brain is a mess. He is thinking about seeing someone new and I don’t want to complicate any relationship because I usually talk to him daily and I know I can’t do that now. My other friend will likely tell him anything I say and I don’t want to over complicate that either. So my support system is completely gone. They are the only people who know what happened to me and I don’t know if I’ll be able to let another person in like that. He said he still cares about me but I have no idea what that means.  I just know that it hurts to lose them.  It feels like I’ve been strung along and I don’t know what I’m going to do now. I start partial hospitalization tomorrow but I don’t know if it’s going to be enough. Too much is happening at once.,03Dec2019,1

So these past few weeks have been extremely stressful. Form being backstabbed by people I though I could trust in my school, to being constantly given shit for my past and judged for interests. The line was crossed when a close friend broke my trust and I snapped at him, and called him out and we got into a fight, he tried to drawl blood and at that point I knew he had no remorse for his actions. For the rest of the day I’ve been emotionless and soulless. When I got home...I lost it, I finally snapped and bloodied my knuckles from my closet door.

I feel completely normal. Nothing is out of the ordinary on my end. Now, I’m pretty sure a majority of people wouldn’t call a lack of compassion normal. I can really only liken what I’m feeling to that of codependency. Then again I’m not exactly a physiologist. I’ve never really felt that I had low self esteem, but after reading something on a very basic google search, it kinda seems like I do. 

I’m mean to myself as a defense system. If insult myself enough, or make myself feel inadequate, no one else can. 

I really don’t know where I’m taking this

I have no outlet. No hobbies, no friends to go hang out with after school, and my family doesn’t do much to help with the lack of “me” time.

44,"Just as a little back story, Im currently 21 years old and when I was in middle school (about 12 years old) I became self conscious of my weight and wanted to be skinny. I️ wasn’t overweight ever, but not skinny. I ate much less and became very skinny, at the time was probably just under 5 feet tall and 70 lbs. But I still didn’t feel skinny at the time and am aware that I was likely on the track of developing an eating disorder but luckily I managed to strengthen my mindset a little and today I am 5’1 and 105 lbs. Although Im better now the paranoia about food has never truly left. I still feel overweight and gross about my body even though I know Im not fat. I don’t really know how to describe the feeling but I always feel like I want to lose weight to feel better about myself. But there are also times where I feel good about my body so that confuses me. But I also get very paranoid about food and every time I eat something I think about what I’ve eaten that day. And I also eat pretty healthy, yet I still overthink what I eat a lot. I also workout every day, and if I don’t workout a day I feel very guilty about I️t. If I overeat I feel super guilty and regret I️t. I just don’t know if my mindset is normal or if I have an issue.

45,"Hello Reddit. I Made an account on here just today because I wanted to talk about something very serious that I would rather see typed out and posted on a screen than to verbally tell someone in person. I cant talk about this in person cuz i just shut down and ignore the receiver. I don't know if it's my brain or whatever that leads or led me to these decisions but it started a little ways back. I was heavily bullied throughout middle school and high school and Mainly for that reason I have been depressed my whole life. The second and third major reasons for my self-diagnosed depression are being Bi-Polar and having a shitty family. I've grown up in a family that is the lowest of the low. It consists of lower class alcoholics, druggies, criminals, you name it. I've been pinned to the ground by police with a loaded gun put to my temple because they mistook me for my uncle. I've seen everything and then some. Well, for these reasons, around the age of 16 I decided that on my twenty-first birthday i was going to buy a ridiculous amount of alcohol and drink myself to death. The plan was to do it alone, in a large river. (I live in Oregon so we have plenty) So if the alcohol didn't kill me I'd drown. I am now twenty-one. I moved away from my family and try to distance myself. I cycled through two terrible jobs and got away/moved away from both. I have no girlfriend or anyone I care about. I've been living with friends in Portland since my birthday month of march and it is now December. Its been alright. We had a good thing going for a while and I got a job at MC-D and i worked there until the month before last. Now, though, we're out of money, out of things to sell, and out of options. One's going to college and the others trying to figure out something we can both do while it would be so much easier if he was by himself. I know it would. I'm tired of burdening them. They've been carrying me through life and I'm tired of it, reader. I'm tired of worrying. I'm tired of trying. I'm tired of pretending the voice in my head doesn't scream  the plan is easier. It would be so much easier. I want to see what's beyond this tiresome life. I want to know there's more than this. Pen-name Trevor Crowson. Had to get that off my chest.

48,"Hi there. (I don’t know how to start this)....

As a child I would fantasize my future, a large mansion with my movie star, model husband and our gorgeous kids, or get this, I was in high school with my super hot jock boyfriend and my closest friends. I even imagined what my first job would be.
   
Even though these are unrealistic, I always had some sort of view on my future. Inevitably, my ideas became more realistic as I matured like decorating my collage dorm room, or going to social events, like most teenagers do.

However, my depression for lack of a better word has consumed me to the point where I am not happy without pleasing others. But that’s beyond the point, I’ve come to the fear that I can’t even imagine where I’ll be next year. Which scares me, it really does.

I “should” be living my “glory days”, parties, friendships and relationships. Yet no one wants to engage with me, yes sure I have friends but I wish i was more social as even though I am annoying, I’d be down to just be included with people and have a good time.

However, I can’t imagine me turning 16. Like no ideas, or no excitement. I can’t imagine me graduating at all, like I know my goal is to further my education and I feel like I will, but for some reason, I cannot see it. Which worries me as college has been a long term goal of mine.

I’ve always wanted to be a doctor, but now I feel like I could never accomplish it and don’t see myself doing any sort of medical field, even though I really want to.

I can’t see myself in a relationship, even though I wanted to be loved and give love to others. I have guy friends, but they don’t think of me romantically and I just don’t see myself getting married, which is something I’ve wanted for a while.

I don’t see myself with a family, which beyond everything is something I’ve always, always wanted. I wanted to hug my little ones on their first days of school, and dry their tears when they had a nightmare . It’s always been a dream. But now, partially due to my neglectful situation, I don’t see it happening.

I don’t see myself at all, like no views. Which scares me because I don’t enjoy the thrill of being alive, I’m living for what comes next. However, I haven’t found my chance to find the right people, but I’m scared. I should be living a happy normal life, and not worried about my mental state...",03Dec2019,1

I attempted to summon a succubus because of that. I did some fake “rituals” online. Now suffering with OCD and needed an assurance that what I attempted to summon was not really there, I went on [r/occult](https://www.reddit.com/r/occult/) to ask people about my questions. The thing was that out of the 20 people who responded I believed the only one who was suspicious about my situation. He told me some actions to take to “communicate” with her. During the same, I started to develop muscle twitches and the feeling of bugs crawling on my skin and hair moving on their own. My doctor attributed the muscle twitches to a lack of sleep (which was true as a freshman). What I found out was that the more sleep I had the less twitches and “bugs” feeling I got. But however I had this fear that these were caused by the succubus around me, and these rituals I did. And since the sensations were many during the day, I kept on thinking whether there is one around me. This has been happening for over 2 years. I’m 100% sure that there exists no spirits around me but since the sensations are frequent I always go back to these thoughts. 2 years down the line, I am completely sick and tired of these thoughts and want to escape. But I can’t. I am scared of inflicting self harm to myself to escape these thoughts and that leads to more anxiety and causes a cycle. I don’t want medical intervention because I don’t want to involve and stress out my parents. What should I do? Will this thought go away as I mature into an adult or should I take interventions?",03Dec2019,1
54,"I am 18 and suffer from severe anxiety and depression. I have been taking medications and going to therapy as treatment since I was a small child. Here in a few months I am planning to move to Missouri to go to school and give myself a fresh start and to also get away from a lot of the stressers that have made my mental health so bad. Problem is, I will be losing my insurance after my birthday, a month before I move. I will no longer be able to get my medications and have the therapy sessions that have made life somewhat bearable up to this point. I can’t afford to pay for most private insurances being that I work part time for Walmart and will also be having to pay for rent, food, utilities and the other necessities (I will be living with my brother and we are splitting these things 50/50). Any advice on maybe what insurances I can look into or services that might be able to help?",03Dec2019,1
55,"Hi so this is possibly going to be long and nonsensical but I can’t stop thinking and I need it off my chest really bad. I haven’t told anyone most of this stuff - not even my psychiatrist. I’m scared that I’m overreacting or something and that things haven’t actually been that bad. I’m just going to list everything off

when I was 5 or 6 my older cousin (would have been 9 or 10) asked me to play ‘doctor’ with him. I don’t know if it counts as molestation or anything because he was a kid too but I feel like he would have been old enough to know that was not okay. He had me lay down on the couch and take off my clothes and then he touched me and stuff. I legitimately forgot about it for years but something caused me to remember it a few years ago and now I think about it literally every day. A lot of times I think that it is not that serious but whenever I think about what actually happened I feel sick. I can envision the whole thing. One of my other cousins who was also my age was also there too it wasn’t a secret or anything. This makes me feel like it was less bad too. I don’t know how I am supposed to feel about it really. I’d like some input on whether or not that is like normal kid stuff or if it is okay that I feel violated

my dad was kind of abusive growing up. I’m the oldest daughter and I have 3 younger brothers. My dad never really hit me. He spanked me sometimes but that was it. I think he didn’t do anything physical because I’m a girl. He was much worse to my brothers. He would slap them and punch them sometimes. It wasn’t everyday or enough to leave big bruises or anything though so I never thought it was abuse. I still don’t really know if it’s abuse honestly but that is what the internet says. one time he was so mad at my brother that he grabbed him and went for his neck and ripped the metal chain off his neck when my brother was like 10. My dad also has an alcohol problem. He did not hit me as much as my brothers but he was verbally just as bad if not worse. When we made/make him mad he would put his fist in our faces and scream about how he wanted to hurt us or kill us. When he was drunk I would genuinely be afraid for my safety sometimes. He’s hit my mom before too. He has broken a lot of things in our house because he will throw stuff when he gets mad and it’s really scary. My friends when I was younger told me they were scared of him. I think some of my friends are worried about me because I am so easily startled and flinch so easily. One of my friends tried to give me a high five once and I only saw it from the corner of my eye and I flinched because I thought he was trying to hit me. Now he is all worried about me.

Once again though I don’t really know if it is abuse because I know that my dad loves us. For every time he did those bad things he would apologize or buy us ice cream and tell us how much he loves us. If he is in a good mood when he’s drunk he gets really emotional. He always comes into my room and cries and talks about how he loves me so so much. I feel like I can’t call it abuse because it’s really not that bad compared to people who would be physically abused all the time or anything

My younger brother who got the worst of it from my dad has been suicidal since literally age 8. One time when I was 11 and he was 9 I was babysitting him and my other brothers. I found him trying to strangle himself with his blanket. Obviously I pulled it off of him and he was screaming and crying. He ran to the balcony and tried to jump off but I grabbed him and pulled him back. He was screaming and crying and punching the whole time. We were staying at family’s in Colorado so it would have been a really really long fall because they lived on a cliff basically. Anyway that was a terrifying experience that I also think about all the time. I don’t know I might be slightly traumatized from it or something

I can’t think of many other specific instances those are the ones that have been most on my mind lately. a lot of other stuff I dealt with were more like constants rather than specific events. I’m a lesbian but my family is super super catholic and conservative, especially my dad. I had a girlfriend for 7 months and they didn’t know I’m way to scared to say anything. I think the extreme religious stuff has also kind of been bad for my mental health. I have OCD and a lot of my worst intrusive thoughts are stuff like “I’m scared that I’m the antichrist and I just don’t know it” or stuff like that. I haven’t told my psychiatrist that specific one either. I know it’s stupid but I don’t want anyone to think I’m like super crazy or anything (even tho with a lot of the thoughts I get that’s maybe a valid label it’s scary)

I don’t know what to do really. Do you think this stuff is worth telling to a doctor or a therapist? I don’t know what they could do for me at this point and I don’t want my dad or my family to get in trouble or anything. I’ve just been really having a hard time lately. I can’t do my school work, I’ve been trying to scratch my legs until they bleed and also hitting them with a hammer to give myself bruises. I’m not planning on killing myself or anything but I don’t really know what to do. I really want to get this off my chest to someone I actually know but I don’t want people to worry or feel sorry for me. I don’t know what to do. I don’t even know if this stuff is bad enough to feel as bad as I do

57,"So, from about the age of 6 on, I was prescribed Ritalin, Concerta and Adderall, until the age of 17, when I joined the military and stopped cold turkey. In addition to that, I was prescribed Clondadine, Seroquel, Risperdal, Depakote and a few others that I can't recall. 

I haven't taken any medication since, and it's been about 7 years since I stopped taking all of my medication. I'm out of the military now, and life has been absolutely awful. It was decent while I was in the military with the structured environment and all, but I was still struggling to keep on the straight and narrow. 

I ended up developing a horrible, horrible alcohol addiction, and it doesn't help that my Mother was also a very bad alcoholic and still is. 

I haven't seen a psychiatrist in years, and I believe the alcoholism mostly stems from my mis-managed life and not being medicated. If I disclose this information to a psychiatrist, will that immediately prevent me from being prescribed any controlled substances?

I have never been addicted to any other drug, except alcohol. I smoke weed occasionally because I see that as the kinder of the two evils.

64,"Hello r/mentalhealth.

This is the first time I am posting here and I hope you guys can help me.

To summarise, I am an undergraduate in one of the top institutions in the world doing a double major and a minor, and I also have good academic standing. 

For the last 3 years I just lost the joy of living. I am sure the reason is not school because I actually enjoy learning new things and studying for academic success.

On the other hand there is no single instance in my life which I can describe as I am happy doing. I have zero joy doing things, I became anti-social over time. I do not try to make friends, I do not try to involve in any community. I always have bad thoughts on my head. Every fucking day I wake up and tell myself “I hope night time comes fast then I can go to sleep.” Every night I say myself “tomorrow is going to be the same.” I am in a state where I pretty much make myself believe that if I die nothing changes. I feel like I already died while living.  When I cross the street and a car comes I say myself “if it hits, it hits. I don’t care.” 

I alienated myself from lots of people, because it seems to me that everything is superficial and waste of a time. I speak way slower than before, constantly swearing to people, environment, entourage and others. 

For example, climate change and environmental activism is a hot topic. My take is that “I don’t care, I am going to die one day so why I should care?” 
When I see people dying over terrorism and stuff I say to myself “people born and die so this is not a big deal”. I lost my feelings. 

When someone tries to talk with me or flirt with me, I constantly lie to escape. 

I don’t know. I had not been optimistic any time-frame of my life but this is too much. Dealing with this is too much as well. 

What can you suggest to me in order to change something? What is your take on the subject? Feel free to ask any type of question if it makes you understand the situation better.

Thanks!",03Dec2019,1

My coworker began at the same time as me but he is way, way ahead. He also says I'm better off pursuing academics instead of practical work because I'm no good at it.

69,"Hey everyone, first time posting here and I just wanted to vent a bit.

I've always had a problem keeping jobs due to my depression and anxiety. I've been living with my mental health issues  for over 15 years. Some jobs were more understanding than others but at the end of the day they need to run a business and my absences affect their operations, I totally understand that.

This has been going on for years where I would need a couple days, sometimes even a whole week to get my head right. The whole process usually starts as soon as I wake up. I feel like I'm tired and shutting down, the negative thoughts rush through my head, the feeling of being small and trapped, etc. Then inevitability I'd call to skip work. Lately it's been especially worse because I've started a new job that I think actually suits me but because they are very strict on performance and attendance I don't think I'll be there very long. I've already skipped two days. **All I want is to be able to go to work everyday** but it's so tough to break through that mental barrier. It's just frustrating because I know I need to work, I know I'm a hard worker but I just can't get the gears moving.

 I'm currently taking anti-depressants and I've made an appointment to see a psychologist in the next couple of weeks.

If anyone out there is or has been in the same situation or has any advice. Feel free to comment

71,"I have had extremely vivid dreams ever since I can remember. The first time I remember experiencing an intense dream that felt real, I was 5. I remember seeing a ghost while laying down, but I couldn't move and I couldn't talk. The ghost kept getting closer and closer to me. He was loud and continued to get louder as he got closer. Then I awoke, except I thought I was awake already. I now know that it was sleep paralysis. I have sleep paralysis at least once a week and have for my entire life since that age. I also have extremely vivid dreams. Most if not all of my dreams are lucid. I have gotten to the point where I can control every aspect of the dream except the setting. I have learned that I can make people dissappear from my dream by believing I can do it. I can teleport, influence people to do what I want by thinking about it. Giving myself super powers like super speed running, flying, jumping high, etc. These dreams feel so real that I constantly confuse them for reality. I always do reality checks to figure out if I'm in a dream or not but I feel I remember my dreams so vividly that life and my dreams mesh together. Even when I'm awake I feel like I'm dreaming. I always do reality checks throughout the day because I question whether I am in the real world. I feel like I watch myself do stuff and look through people instead of at them. Everything always seems like a blur when I'm awake it's hard to explain. Sometimes the dream world feels more real than this one. I'm not sure what's wrong with me. I've had a sleep study done on me but they couldn't find anything irregular. I want to get a second opinion at some point though. I remember during that sleep study I thought the nurse had come in and attacked me. But it hadn't happened as it was sleep paralysis. I woke up swinging. I find it weird they found nothing wrong with my sleep patterns. I'm not really reading what I wrote so if it doesn't make sense and is all over the place I apologize. I just felt the need to get this out there. Idk if this is normal or what it is and I don't expect anyone to have the answer. Thanks for reading if you did.
Edit: I don't feel real and nobody else feels real although I am in the real world. I check the time and it's the same on the second look. I could have added this into what I wrote but I don't feel focused enough to search for a place to add it or if this is even necessary.",03Dec2019,1
72,"Three years ago, I may or may not have smoked laced pot. I smoked pot almost every day for around a year and then randomly, I smoked some that sent me into an 8 hour episode of crying, paranoia, puking, and insisting that I was overdosing and dying. After that, there were a few times I smoked and was fine. But there were a few times where I would get dizzy, have hot flashes, profusely sweat, and have inconsolable panic attacks until the high went away. I haven’t smoked now in two years, and after I quit, for an entire summer, I suffered from delusions that people were putting drugs into my food and drinks, or that I could get high by touching another person who done drugs. I wouldn’t wear anyone else’s clothes or jackets for fear of getting high from their sweat and I wouldn’t have sex with my spouse if they had smoked any pot or done any drug. I was scared of consuming alcohol for fear of losing touch with reality and not being able to control when the drunk feeling would be over. I don’t like to be out of control. I thought everyone on my high school bus was smoking weed in the back and I would even convince myself I could smell it and when I got off the bus, I felt like I would faint the whole way home. The panic attacks happened everywhere and lasted for hours multiple times a day every day for a whole summer. After the summer was over, I gradually brought myself back to reality and since that summer, I’ve only had a handful of panic attacks (haven’t had one in over a year), and have experienced no symptoms of psychosis. The delusions about poison and drugs went away over a year ago as well. I have not taken any medication for what I went through. I didn’t even see a therapist. I just let it all pass because I was scared of the drugs they would prescribe making me high. I took Prozac for depression and anxiety from when I was 12 until 15 and I had no problem taking it but after the pot incident, I believed anything and everything would get me high or harm me. Now, I drink alcohol occasionally, can smoke pot while I’m drunk, and even took Percocet I was prescribed after an oral surgery, all with no issue. It’s like that summer never existed. My only problems that I still carry are the occasional needs to turn a light on and off a certain number of times, or touch things a certain number of times, just really small things that don’t affect my life negatively and are more of an annoyance. My questions here is that even though the major life interfering OCD seems to have went away, should I still seek help and get medication or do you think it could worsen my symptoms once again? I don’t feel as if I need it but I never want to go through another state of life that I did a few years ago and sometimes I’m terrified it could come back at any minute.",03Dec2019,1

I don’t know where to start.

I’m sad, I’m extremely sad. I’m also angry. I feel overwhelmed with everything I need to do : find an apartment, finish packing, splitting stuff, move out, buy everything I don’t have anymore because we had everything twice and I had to get rid of my stuff, start over all alone. I recently moved cities in order to achieve some of our life plans. I don’t have any friends or support system.

77,"Was I sexually assaulted and should I contact authorities?

I was thinking of making a throwaway account for this but I need other people’s opinion.

It was New Years 201X and I had been with this girl for 4 months and best friends for even longer. We had a tradition that every New Years we’d hang out and play video games, I thought that She was perfect because we both enjoyed a lot of the same things.

The following is very important that you fully read: I am very awkward when it comes to touching and kissing, basically I’m the Textbook definition of a prude. She is very aware of this and even just a quick kiss from time to time was enough to send my face red. This was also my first relationship and I was very inexperienced with the whole girlfriend thing.

Back to New Years 201X. After playing video games until we eventually get tired and decide to watch a movie. We both were sitting on the same couch until eventually she mentions being cold, I knew this was a lie just to get closer but I was willing to try something new. I was young enough at the time to understand that having a girl pressed into you Is a good feeling that I wanted to experience.

After cuddling for about an hour she says “try something new”. Of course being introduced to something I wanted to try something but didn’t want to because of the conflicting feelings. Half of my brain wanted to grab her ass and the other half didn’t. I told her what I wanted to do but then told her that it’s better if I don’t. She knew exactly how to talk to me to get me to do it but to put a long story short I ended up with my hand on her ass. We continued watching the movie to which she later responded something along the lines of her wanting my hands elsewhere. At this point I said no. I was in a position where I was uncomfortable and because of that I moved couches because we had two. She followed me and repeatedly asked me to touch her *NOT TO PENETRATE HER* of course every time I said no. Eventually the movie ended and we went to bed. The next morning she left and I thought the nightmare was over.

A few weeks later I got a text asking to come over. I told her after the night before that I didn’t want to continue seeing her because of constant pressure. She told said “fine. But come over so we can talk about it first” I of course being the dumbass I was agreed and when I got to her house we went straight to her room and the pressuring began again. This time to not only her ass but her crotch and chest too. I kept saying no but she continued to say things like “stop being such a prude” and “judging by your dick you’re enjoying it” and while I was stiff as a rock that was a natural reaction that I couldn’t control. I wanted to push her off but I felt frozen and forced to do what she told me. A few hours past and she finally let me leave to which I vowed never to speak to her again. However she kept in contact with me and told me if I ever told anybody she’d tell everyone I had assaulted her. I realized that her story matched perfectly. “Tall older person was sexually touching me as I was saying no”. I realized I was trapped and now I can’t do anything. When I tried telling other people and even authorities they didn’t believe me and told me I should’ve fought her off. My therapist told me to ignore the past because we can’t change it but that doesn’t help.We haven’t spoken to each other in ages but she’s doing the same thing to my closest friend and he doesn’t believe me. He’s stopped talking to me and I assume she’s told him her side of the story. This relationship has prevented me from feeling trust and love and I don’t know what to do.

I can’t sleep. It’s 2:48 AM. I’ve been laying here thinking about my lack of community all night. My social skills are terrible, so I’m a social outcast.  I’m depressed most days with brief glimpses of happiness.

I have a child and a pregnant wife so suicide isn’t something I want to consider. I just really don’t want to deal with this shit anymore. I’ve don’t see the value in pushing forward without friends and people who love me other than family. 

I think lack of close relationships is a symptom of one, or several larger problems including depression and weak social skills. 

I just keep thinking about how much easier a bullet to the chest would be than dealing with social isolation and depression. The suicidal thoughts are terrible. I don’t have a plan, it’s just a brief thought that pops in my head. But that fucking thought is suffocating and recurring.",03Dec2019,1

I just want to be happy, but I feel I’m never going to get anywhere and there’s no point of trying to progress because it feels impossible. I wish I could back and time 3 years ago where I was happy, I wasn’t jaded, and was going to make art for a living. That would’ve been enough for me.

83,"So I need to start somewhere I guess, may as well  start with the fact that despite helping others with their mental health and how to cope, I myself am drowning in my own mind, refuse any and all help because the idea of seeking helping is a sign that I would be weak and somewhat admit that I’m vulnerable which can’t happen I won’t let that be part of what people see.

The first issue we could touch on which could be causing allot of other things is the complete and total lack of emotion, I think this is where I started to realise that something wasn’t right, that I wasn’t okay. I feel hollow all moments of the night and day no love, happiness, sadness, the only thing I’ve felt for years now pure and unadulterated anger always so angry and it never goes away it won’t leave me.

To avoid this being an issue and publicly known to not appear like some hollow freak I just read the situation and express the emotion that I know is correct for the situation, faking it because I can’t feel what I’m supposed to.

This brings the psychological loneliness, physically I have a large friends group which is great, good people, but I’ve told myself that I’m mentally isolated, nobody is going to understand, relate or somewhat know what I’m talking about, meaning that they have no idea the fucking demons that have a stranglehold on me.

Fear. All the time the fear is there, the fear that one day I’m going to hurt someone, that the anger is going to boil and spill out into the open and somebody is going to get hurt, this leads to dark thoughts of stopping myself before that time ever has a chance to come, I don’t want to hurt people.

Overwhelming guilt, I’ve done allot of good things for people without them knowing, and they’ll never know what I did for them because I just want to see people flower and live freely without consequence and circumstances that they can not do anything about, so I’ve stopped consequences, changed situations for people without so much as a message to let them know, will this excuse all the bad things I’ve done to make the good happen? Am I really the right person to decide if what I’ve done justifies the outcome I was striving for.

And it’s not just other people, my partner my beautiful kind and loving SO she is an angel through to her core, and I’m poisonous for her, I see it sometimes she can tell something is wrong but she doesn’t understand what happens because I never talk, I’m keeping her in the dark because I believe that keeps her safer and puts her mind at greater ease than knowing the troubles and being worried for and about me, I’ve tried to let her go and tell her that things aren’t going to get easier for me and that I don’t want her caught up in my shit.

She knew me before I changed before things happened and before I become a hollow shell of who I once was, so she knows something is wrong and I hate myself for not being the person she first knew and the person she fell in love with, self hatred runs without me like blood through veins.

There allot of things that need to come out into the world about me but I’m not ready for that yet, even anonymous there’s things I won’t let myself say",03Dec2019,1

I don't know if this is due to us purchasing a home and having children, or if that's just how it works. He's seen multiple psychiatrists, psychologists, counsellors, doctors and been put on different medication. It's definitely helped, but it's still a huge issue.

He fixates on an issue and obsesses over it for however long it a problem, and as soon as it's fixed or gone or suddenly not an issue then he fixates on something else. He keeps telling me that I'm so patient, and thanking me for being so wonderful about it but inside I am literally banging my head against a wall. I've even noticed I dig my nails into the palms of my hands without noticing it when he brings up stupid situations.

He gets to talk to someone about his issues, but if I ever being up ANYTHING that's bothering me I'm being ""ridiculous"", it's just ""stupid"", ""why would you even think that would happen tho? That's dumb"". It's like his issues are real issues, and everyone else's are unimportant.

He's had every scan and test you can think of, has thought he was dying of every illness or disease possible and had all the tests to prove otherwise. I just want to punch him.

This might be long. But please, I need help. And I’m too afraid to mention these things to my doctor. 

Where do I start? If you, reader, have seen the Netflix show “You”, you’ll understand me. I identify heavily with that character. I sympathize with him, and I understand all of his feelings and motives. I had a boyfriend for 3 years. He left me, and I’ve become obsessive. I’ve tried manipulating him back, guilt-tripping him, threatening him, all to try to get him back. I’ve tried begging and pleading. I’m obsessed with him. He blocked me on everything so I created a fake Facebook profile and waited until the profile looked like it had existed for a while, then sent him a friend request. I’ve been spying on him that way. He’s found someone new. I went through his phone and got that guy’s phone number now. I haven’t contacted him, but I’m tempted to. Every time I think of my ex with someone else I’m overcome by blind rage and jealousy. In my mind, he’s mine and belongs to me. I drive by his house several times a week to see if he’s home when he should be. I followed him to the grocery store once to see if he was alone. It’s getting out of hand but the thing is, I can’t stop. I can’t let go of him. I have fantasies of finding this guy that’s replaced me and hurting him. Not killing him, but causing him physical pain in front of my ex so he knows he was stupid to run from me. My ex does t belong with anyone else. He belongs with me. He changed the passwords to most of his accounts when he found out I had accessed them, but he doesn’t know I’m still logged into his Reddit on my phone and I see all the guys he talks to and it kills me. Being without him is causing me emotional torment and I’m afraid if it continues I’ll be driven to do something extreme.

It's resistable, but I'm worried that I may fall to a point where they aren't anymore. My usage is about weekly for alcohol or weed, and daily for coffee and sugar.

I've just started college a couple months ago and I assume my need for them is primarily to get oxytocin, as I don't have as many friends here as I used to and whenever my thoughts start spiraling they go to how badly I want a relationship. I feel somewhat confident in this as I read that all of these drugs produce some oxytocin when consumed.

92,"When i was  a kid, i had a hard time(bullying, distant parents, maybe a manipulative mother).

When i was around the elementary school, i developed extreme and irrational fears.

I always thought, that somebody is going to murder me and so i was extreme careful to everything.(checked my meals for poison, always be ready to be killed).
I couldnt sleep good for many years, because i thought, there is a murderer in my house, whos trying to kill me.
Every mistake i made (for example saying a wrong word in a presentation) created so much fear, that i thought, someone will murder me for the mistake.

If i woke up, i had fear to open my eyes, because there could be a murderer.So i waited for a few minutes to open my eyes and in that time, i carefully heard my surroundings for danger.  The same goes for watching in the mirror and putting on t shirts.

I would randomly freeze while moving and stay for minutes in the same position, because i had so much fear. 

I felt like an hamster in a hamster wheel.
Always running away from danger, but the danger is always coming with me.

I thought, that everybody can read my mind, so i was even careful about my mind.
Also thought, that we have cameras in our home, that watches every step of me, so i didnt even felt safe in my home.(i regulary watched adult televison shows in the evening as a kid.There were violent shows for a seven year old like south park, family guy, drawn together.There was also a show, where a film crew put cameras in a house and „secretly“ made a series about them. i thought at this time, that it was real) 

I also had social phobia and mistrusted everybody, because i thought, everybody will harm/kill me.

Had haunting nightmares as a kid (parents left me alone, world gets destroyed by a meteorite etc.)

My fears got worse and worse until my family and i moved away.(after six years of extreme fear)

Many fears disappeared instantly, while some fears got away with time. 
But I’m still not happy with my life and i want to change it. And in my opinion is my childhood an important reason, why I’m a people pleaser, an avoidant and weak person, who can’t stand up for myself.I think that in my core, I’m still a young fearful boy, who never experienced love and doesn’t wants to be rejected by people.

Can somebody please tell me, what mental problem i had as a child (i know that the answer would not be accurate) and how i can manage it?",03Dec2019,1
93,"Growing up, I never really was the most empathetic. I had empathy and felt guilt but I still did more aggressive, teenage-boy type stuff even from a young age.
I was heavily influenced by NPD abuse and over times of trauma, I slowly broke emotionally. I developed ASPD and narcissistic traits(not NPD) genetically. 10 years of slowly becoming an emotionless meat puppet vessel have frustrated me. I have no feeling, no morals, and yet I still am plagued by the guilt, remorse, and anxiety of my past, and that clashes with my immoral nature.
I feel as if ptsd has installed something that indirectly clashes with my disorders, while also supporting it. I say this because sometimes I get an evil, sadism-fueled dopamine rush at times during certain situations. I literally break personality and don’t recover until I take time or get to my senses.
It gave me new emotions that I couldn’t handle, and these emotions impact me whether good or bad, and idk what to do.
I used to feel so good, unempathetic, and motivated in my teens to adulthood, but now I am stuck in what I actually believe is a recovering conscience. Stuck in a moral debate with my ego and my conscience.

I'm having a hard time putting my thoughts and feelings into words and struggle even understanding them in the first place.
So...
How do you handle such conversations with your therapist?
How can I convey that anything and any reason I bring up is not necessarily the one and only reason for my aggression/sadness/joy...?

The current situation is that I had a sudden (internal) outburst of aggression at work. Why? I don't know. Maybe because the equipment doesn't function perfectly which pisses me off more than it should?
But that doesn't make sense; it is not enough reason to want to destroy something or even hurt someone, or is it? If so, how do people handle that?
Of not, why does it fuck me up so badly and how do I make it stop?
And to get back to the topic: How do I explain that to my therapist?

I have a friend who has major depression, and I'm worried that he is going to commit suicide. For background he is in 11th grade and is transgender. He was born a girl but he prefers if we use male pronouns and call him by a different name. He also is abused by his father (who I suspect has his own mental issues because of his unpredictable reactions) and cuts himself. And he also is Bipolar and has Multiple Personality disorder. Also he has a court case where he is trying to live with his grandmother instead of his father and his step mom.

He talks with me and his other friends often, and we try our best to help. I also listen to my other friends's problems and give them advice for said problems. I'm not sure what his other friends are doing but I have been doing my own things to help him. I have been listening to his problems, giving advice, trying to make him smile, comforting him, giving him goals, and I have tried to help him stop cutting by making a deal with him. The deal is that if he can go \_\_ days without cutting I can get him a candy bar or other little things as a way to encourage and reward him to stop cutting. As of right now its at 3 days.

The reason I'm asking for help though is that I'm worried he will commit suicide. He was going to cut himself with a razor at school but he told one of his friends. That friend convinced him to give him the razor. When he did that he went to the counselor. Their he was talked to by the police and Child Protective Services. They all brought him to a mental hospital where he stayed with others with similar problems as him for 2 weeks.

Yesterday though he brought pills to school. He told me that he told a friend he was going to attempt suicide at school by overdosing. That friend convinced him to hand him the pills and got him to the councilor. I don't know who exactly was their or what they were talking about but I know the basics. Apparently he might be ""punished"" for bringing ""drugs"" to school. He thinks he will be suspended, and I'm hoping that won't be his punishment. I don't know the specific kind of pills he brought but he said that his parents already hide his pills, so I'm not sure how he got his hands on the pills he brought to school. I'm in 11th grade as well and have classes with him, but I asked some of his friends and they said that they haven't seen him today so far. I know I might be worried for nothing, and that he is most likely getting taken care of, but I can'y help but worry.

So please tell me what to do. I'm desperate to help him. I have made it one of my goals to keep him alive and see his transition into a boy. Also know a bit more then others my age about mental disorders and illnesses, and I have access for more info on how to help from my mom who is a school psychologist. Yet I can't help but feel like I need to do more and that I should be doing something else to help him. Personally I feel like he should be in the hospital so he can get better, but he isn't sure if it will help. Also he already missed a lot of school and he just caught up so he doesn't want to leave right now. So please please tell me what I should do. I want to do anything I can to help him. Please tell me if I'm doing anything wrong or if I should do something else. Thanks for listening.",03Dec2019,1

117,"My entire life, i've told myself that when I grow up, i'm going to become a lawyer and live in a big city. I go to NYU now and I thought this would be it for me, but I realized that I don't even know what I should major in to really make it in new york city. I'm constantly stressed because of how expensive it is to live here, I can't focus in my classes, and I want to be able to do whatever it takes to get into Harvard for law school. I currently have a C in one of my classes and still will by the time the semester is over, I have little to no social life (I just sit alone and watch tv because I don't want to speak to anyone), and most of all, I don't know if even if I do all of this stuff to become a corporate lawyer, it would even be worth it. I don't really have a passion for anything anymore. I used to be a huge politics junkie, and now i'm too tired of arguing with people to care. I used to love the environment and want to save kids in other countries, and now I can't even manage to be bothered about it anymore. I used to have major depression in high school, but the difference between then and now is that I can't even feel anything about anything anymore. At least when I was chronically sad I was able to feel some kind of emotion that isn't either numbness or extreme anxiety (they sound contradictory but I honestly live them both at once). I have no idea what i'm doing and I don't even know what I want out of life either. I don't know if I want to have a nice little family in vermont, or be a hotshot lawyer in new york city, whether I want to be insanely rich, or drop everything and travel the world. (when I say rich i don't mean like you can be rich without any work, I mean just working towards being rich). I have no idea what would make me happy and I literally have no direction or sense of purpose and it's the worst feeling in the entire world. Is this feeling temporary?

My brother moved away a year ago and I'll be moving in with him after I graduated from H.S, nearly every night for the past weeks I have been having nightmares of being alone in the dark, frozen in my bed with my eyes open, it feels so real, I feel my legs barely moving and was trying to throw myself off my bed to end the dream. My sister's who live in the room next to me with thin walls has been saying I've been trying to call for my brother in a distressful way.

I've been a habitual weed smoker everyday, and an occasional drug user but recently I've been binging on DXM, acid--somewhat--molly and oxys for the past month and now I feel so horrible and sick always, getting sexually abused is a big problem for me now but that's just the tip of the iceberg in a melting pot of so many other problems.

(I'm gonna see a therapist in the foreseeable future) 

I don't know what's going on with me. I have very strange (paranoid maybe?) thoughts, which are mostly that I have mental illnesses, schizophrenia and aspergers. The schizophrenia is probably bullshit, but it just keeps coming to my mind, and I just spend a shit ton of time reading about it, I also think sometimes of the future me with full blown schizophrenia, like what it's going to be like.

With aspergers, I just kinf of use it to justify my weirdness, that I've had my whole life and I just didn't admit to myself. My parents think that I have a good social life in school (I don't), I don't talk to anyone, I feel like everyone's just weird (well, it's probably me who's weird). I thought about talking to my parents about this, but it just seems pointless, I actually don't really wish other people to know about my personal life (not even the good things).

I also can't imagine what it's like to be someone other than me, in the last few months, once or twice I had the thought that maybe I'm the only real being, and every other person is just part of my brain (if this makes any sense).

I also think a lot about simulation theory stuff, the existence of god, different realities, but that's probably because the psychedelics that I took.

My main issue is that I don't know if thi is normal adolescence and growing up, or I'm fucked up somehow.

The weirdest thing is that as I'm writing this, I feel completely chill and fine, I have a kind of balanced life that I overall enjoy. It's just that I habe these ""strange"" things sometimes, that don't make any sense at all.

Anyways, thanks for reading, I just needed to write this down somewhere.",03Dec2019,1
123,"After 2 years of trying to help myself, I’ve finally decided to get some professional help.

My school watched an assembly on depression right around the time I made this decision, and  during the assembly they handed out a slip of paper you could write your name on if you wanted to see a school counselor. I thought, finally — this is exactly what I wanted. I wrote my name down; and my visit to the school counselor couldn’t have disappointed me more.

He asked me some questions, pulled up my grades, and came to the conclusion I was doing okay. I have good grades, a normal social life, and at that moment I was, in fact, doing okay. I wasn’t in the middle of a depressive episode. I see how he came to that conclusion, but after asking all of the surface-level questions, he just... stopped. He became disinterested. Did he even listen to the assembly? They gave an example of a person just like me, giving the message, yes, these people can have mental issues too. 

I told him I was afraid to confront my parents and that was a big reason why I was talking to him; but the advice I was left with was “talk to your parents”. Thank you, that is exactly what I didn’t want to hear.

Skip to now, and I tell my mom that I want therapy. I didn’t want to go into it too much because I still feel uncomfortable talking to her about this. I was crying and could barely talk, but she kept prying, until I told her I got a headache and went to sleep.

We’ve been talking over text, and she tells me how she’s been calling therapeutic centers seeing if she could make an appointment for me... 

and they’re all booked until January and February. 

Talking to the school counselor was a failure, and now I have to wait a month or two until I can see a therapist. I’m sorry, but, what the fuck? It took me a year to muster up the courage to admit that I wanted to see a professional. I find out these professionals are untrained and underpaid.

He's never had a girlfriend because, he is ugly, he's a very cool guy but he's just not at all attractive. And his appearance is slowly degrading, he literally wears the same t-shirt every day even tho it has no less than 10 holes in it, he drinks heavily because he claims that's the only way he can go through the day. He makes a respectable amount of money so he's not poor by any means but absolutely nothing brings him joy. 

I suggested we go to a psychologist for help, I tried to tell him that depression is a sickness and there's no shame in it, but he's afraid the doctors will put him in a mental institution or something, and I kinda understand that because a guy we both knew suffered the same fate. It's obvious he's in a spiral, every day he gets worse, he casually talks about suicide, about not deserving anything good to happen to him. We live in this student dorm even tho we finished our ""education"" 3 years ago because it's super cheap, we're surrounded by young and happy looking people and that annoys him, but he doesn't seem to want to move out, i don't know why.

125,"6 months ago I was so fucking excited to have my own classroom of first/second graders. It was finally happening for me and I couldn’t wait. My grandpa died in September and I haven’t had a strong hold on anything since. I’ve always struggled with depression but it’s escalated and has joined forces with some serious anxiety.. on Sunday morning, idk if I was day dreaming or still half asleep, but I pictured myself swallowing a ton of pills and sitting down to write a note goodbye to my huge, loving, supportive family. I’ve never thought that dark and it really really scared me. It was like I was watching myself do it but I was still the one feeling and thinking? It seemed so normal and real. I’m starting an intensive 1-3 week group therapy tomorrow and I’m already dreading going back to school after this. The questions I’ll be asked, the looks, the assumptions. I’ve had some level of depression and anxiety since high school and I guess I never realized how hard it would be to deal with them while in a field of work that is ideally so positive and productive. I feel like a failure. 

I want to fully immerse myself in this program because I absolutely need it.. I feel like teaching has become my only identity because I’m so scared of losing it..

127,"Mental illness tends to create a domino effect in our lives. But I like it better when compared to the sea, open to all sorts of analogies. 

I first felt the first wave of depression coming to take me under my first year of college. It was pretty unexpected, because I graduated high school feeling like I was just carelessly floating, with the cool waters splashing my neck and the sun blazing at my face. I had no idea how soon that depths of the water would be coming to drown me.  

It sucks because I didn’t even realize that I was drowning until it was too late, until my lungs were already filled with water and I was no longer capable of screaming out for help. Soon enough though, some sort of serenity washed over me. It was dark but it was also quiet and peaceful. I didn’t mind so much anymore that sunlight wasn’t peaking in through the curtains. Every time I stepped outside, the darkness followed to swallow me hole once again. But depression is also a mask, because things are very easy to hide on the surface. I look back and think thats the reason why I never let anyone in. Because from afar, the picture looked so pretty and I would’ve hated to ruin anything by letting people take a closer look at the details. 

I dove in cannon ball style into a new life and the part where it went wrong was that I never made it back to the surface. And those small ripples created by the water got bigger and bigger, making it even harder for me to take control of my own life and decisions.

I don’t even know how I got myself out, I don’t remember. There is no way to understand depression until you’ve felt it and I didn’t even know I was depressed until I was no longer.",03Dec2019,1

130,"Hello! I don’t really know what I’m doing. Ranting? Asking for advice? I just feel so lost. I’m not good with putting my emotions into words either so this is gonna be a complete mess. 

So I used to be really good about hiding my problems and not really letting them take over my way of living(other than in school, my grades have been pretty bad lately and that’s adding a whole other level stress).

This year has been the worst for me. I just can’t keep it together. I feel like I’m exploding over the littlest things. I’ve stopped letting toxic family members walk all over me, but any time I try to defend myself or get mad at them for being horrible to me, it always backfires and makes things so much worse for me. I’d love to move out but I don’t have a job that would give me the financial stability I need to live on my own.

I’m so scared I won’t be able to graduate college due to my grades being so low. I’ve come to hate my major. I can’t bring myself to make more of an effort to do better, and even if I do try, I always fail. I had everything planned out and even though I know life doesn’t always work according to your plans, I feel like I have no future. 

I don’t want to do anything. I signed up for online classes so that I wouldn’t have to go to class. I used to do better online than in a traditional classroom setting whenever I knew the subject well enough, but now it’s just an excuse to not go to school except for my exams. I always want to just spend my day laying in bed. I’ve been better about forcing myself to go out: I go to my local coffee shop or Starbucks to do my homework/study, I run all my mom’s errands for her. Usually, whenever I was on break from school, I worked at a company from 8-3:30ish which would keep me from just being home all day, but this time around I feel like I HAVE to force myself to go back because I need the money. 

The only thing that brings me happiness are music, some shows that I watch, and my cat. I’ll spend all my time at home switching between walking aimlessly around my room while listening to music, and being on my laptop watching some funny shows. I used to be *really* bad about just sitting on my laptop all day, and although I’d give my cat attention in terms of pets and cuddles and feeding him properly, I didn’t play with him/give him exercise as much as I should have. I’ve gotten much better about this as I was worried about him gaining too much weight, but I had a really bad panic attack twice due to a personal situation that occurred two days ago and any time I’m home I just want to be curled up in bed, or I’ll just be laying on the floor crying. I’ve had a migraine that hasn’t gone away since that night and really bad chest pains whenever I think about it. I know it was very recent and it won’t be as bad as time goes on, but I’m stressed as I have my finals coming up next week. I need to focus on studying especially with the classes I struggle with, but I just can’t bring myself to do it no matter what. I’m just tired of *everything* and I don’t find anything fun other than those shows.

132,"I don’t expect any responses, I just need type out my thoughts. 

I’ve been considering suicide for so long now. As the years passed since 3rd grade I began to hate myself and develop suicidal thoughts. I would talk to myself in the mirror and tell myself that I’m a horrible person and that I should kill myself. My mom and stepdad would fight every day, and it got to the point where he had grabbed her wrists and pinned her to the couch while my mom yelled for me to call the cops. This trauma kickstarted my depression a few months later. I hated myself so much, I couldn’t stop thinking about how I wanted to kill myself but couldn’t, because I was a scared little 10 year old. The self hatred ended this year, but the depression did not. I personally feel like the self hatred formed because I’m always yelled at, and I’m very well convinced now that I’m really just a burden to my family and all. I’m FtM, and no one in my family accepts that. My mom won’t let me cut my hair, and it looks so shitty that I can’t look in the damn mirror without hating how I look. Every single fucking day she has to bring up about how I’m “trans for attention”. Every move I make is wrong to her, and I’m only criticized but never complimented. She gets mad when I express any fucking emotion besides happy, when she won’t understand that I physically don’t know how to enjoy life anymore, because for so long I’ve been so scared of being deprived of enjoying things that I didn’t allow myself to know what that feels like. The only action that I do that my mind affiliated with enjoyment is listening to music, and even that is starting to wear off. There is no human being on this entire planet that I really trust, and the only person I really care about anymore is the frontman of my favorite goddamn band. I really do want to run away, but I still would have no roof that I belong to. It’s not like living with my dad would be much better: he claims to “accept” me, yet still treats me as his daughter. News flash: accepting isn’t “I won’t hate you because you want to be my son” it’s “you are my son”. I have a few friends but I don’t trust them, and to be quite honest I hate talking to any of them and have completely lost interest in everything. I’ve became stupidly indecisive and can hardly think for myself anymore. Because I’m so alone now, I write to myself, or sometimes I imagine talking to some of the people who once cared about me, but I have pushed them away and acted like a dick to the point where they’re sick of me. I would love to run away, but I’d have nowhere to go. I’ve deadass considered trying to find the frontman of my favorite band because I am so clueless right now. I want to run away because I haven’t tried it yet, and I want to assess and test all my options before I go about killing myself. 

I thank everyone who has read this, but unfortunately there really isn’t any hope for me.

By the way, I know someone is going to mention a hotline or whatever the fuck so I’m just gonna go ahead and say no. I have tried them before, it’s awkward as hell for me, I’m insecure about my voice anyway, and talking to someone on the hotline is nowhere near comparable to having someone who genuinely cares about you, is available and trustworthy, and is also someone you actually know personally. You can’t develop a real relationship with someone over a hotline.",03Dec2019,1

137,"i’ve been having a lot of trouble with memory for the past few years. i’ll start thinking of something, and then 20 seconds later if i lose my focus on it i’ll completely forget and never remember. rarely i’ll remember it minutes or even hours later. i often rely on visual stimuli to remember things, though it doesn’t work a lot of the time. if i’m watching a show, and i’m thinking about something, i can focus on it but once i start focusing on the show more i’ll forget about it. to try and remember i’ll rewind the show to where i was thinking of whatever it was and sometimes the association with that will bring the thought back, but often it doesn’t. when this happens and i can’t remember i’ll get upset and desperately try to remember whatever it was. i also often write down in my notes app thoughts i think i’ll forget and also go to google and keep it in a tab if it’s something i was going to research. it takes up a lot of time and it’s pretty distressing, i wish my memory wasn’t so terrible like this. i just wanna know if anyone else experiences this and if anyone has any tips to improve memory. i’m not sure what caused it but i do have ADHD, NPD, and formerly SUD, so drugs may have also aided in impairment along with the psychiatric disorders. this is a frustrating issue so if anyone has any advice to help with it that would be appreciated.",03Dec2019,1

I know not all GPs can diagnose and support mental health issues but after extensive research I was under the impression they can all refer me somewhere for more help.

142,"I am a 19 year old man that has dealt with depression and anxiety for more than five years. When I was thirteen, I began suffering from anxiety attacks and a persistent low mood. I remember laying on the couch writhing in emotional pain. I was hospitalized two times in eighth grade and was dealing with suicidal ideation. I gradually got better throughout high school, but after high school I was bottoming out again.

My mother has helped me through it all and supported me and so did the rest of the family. But recently, my mind had gone off the deep end with depression and anxiety. I started crying excessively and had the belief that my mother died and that any time I had with her after the perceived death was not real. I was going through the stages I would go through if my mother was actually gone. It turned to dreading to the point of tears when she would be gone to work or even out of my line of sight.

I have a feeling I am dealing with an emerging mental illness separate from my depression and anxiety. It is really difficult appreciating my mother and being without my mother. I am feeling really vulnerable and crippled. I told her I could be dealing with a delusion. I would love to not feel this way about my mother.

143,"Hey everyone,

So it's been a very bad year because I got injured and I spent most of this year in bed because I couldn't walk. I spent so much time in my room that I started to get desperate and feel suffocated when it would happen.

The other day, I was at my uncle's house and everyone was on their phone. I started getting desperate because they were on their phones and we weren't talking at all to each other and I had to leave immediately. When I got to my room, I had to take off my clothes and put my hair in a bun because I felt everything was too tight or bothering my body. 

It has gotten better because I couldn't sleep with clothes on or even with my blanket. I can now sleep with a tshirt on and with my blanket but sometimes in the middle of the night I get that feeling back and have to sleep completely naked.

Should I consider seeking out for professional help?",03Dec2019,1

Avoided charges of threats to kill, assault, assault with a weapon, kidnapping. I've held people hostage at knifepoint before. I've hit people with chairs. I have spent over 2.5 years in hospital mostly in secure units. Sometimes in seclusion for up to 2 weeks at a time.

Nowadays I don't even fight. I'm mostly a changed person. My behaviours have changed for sure. But there is always that itch inside that I wanna scratch so badly. I dream of fighting almost 24/7. Fighting. Beating people, then once they're beat I think of breaking their fingers, blinding them, smashing their teeth apart.

It really must be an obsession. Obviously an unhealthy one. Though I can promise I won't perform any of this. Not only am I not stupid; it's illegal. But I'm changed. I'm good now. I don't want to undo the work I've tried so desperately hard to achieve these last few years.

Sometimes I'll hide food in my room for future days but they search my room and take things at will. I'm a compulsive hoarder and mainly hoard things relating to food. My room is filled with wrappers and rotting food. Because of this I'm not allowed to use any of the same eating utensils or plates or bowls as my parents.

I think that may be it, but let me get to the point.

My bf and I have been dating for over a year and I found myself feeling different in the relationship, but honestly I think some of that was me just getting used to being in my first serious relationship and things changing in my life. However at this point and for the past few months I just sometimes feel trapped and like maybe I am just not in something that I should be in and it sucks. I keep wondering if I have depression or something and that causes me to get over the top about some of this stuff, but I also think it could be this relationship causing it.

My bf has done some things like drink way too much and act like a jerk and upset me and said some disrespectful things to me, not knowing they were rude. Such as telling me that a person on tv was in better shape than me, just because I said ""he needs help getting up"" and it was a linebacker football player. Also saying that he bets my roommate gets better grades than me, just because I talked about how she is a dual major.

Additionally, he just is kind of insensitive sometimes, even though he has dedicated a lot of time to me and I know he loves me so much and he does treat me well and compliment me.

151,"
I'm a 25 year old man and when I was 19 I was assaulted leaving me with a broken jaw. This required surgery in my mouth to put a plate in to close the fracture. I'm just looking for advice because I find myself totally preoccupied with the effects that it's left me with and it's causing me quite a lot of distress.
Obviously there is a scar in my mouth which I find myself tongueing constantly. It's also slightly displaced some teeth and although imperceptible to other people, it's left one side of my jaw sort of slightly different as there's a plate under there. This sounds vain but I find this really worrying as it's a reminder of a really traumatic incident. As well as this it has left an area below my lip numb due to damage to a nerve. The best way I can describe the feeling is just being constantly aware of it, I find myself massaging the area, feeling the plate underneath and this has left me in a sort of obsessed state. Occasionally I will take pictures in certain light to examine the ever so slight assymetry and it just leaves me feeling anxious and depressed wishing it never happened and thinking about how different my life would be if this never happened.

I have contacted the surgeon to see if they can take it out. This would mean another surgery though I haven't heard back. This would have its own risks but I feel that it might correct this ever so slight flaw that I have in my face. As I said, this sounds like pure vanity but it's more trying to get rid of a reminder of trauma that is making me feel so unhappy. I'm not sure what I'm expecting by posting this, it's more of a vent. But Prehaps someone could give me a bit of advice in this situation.

Specially an ankle injury that happened in grade 1. I remember it being really bad, the injury lasted 2-3 months but my mom insists it never happened. It makes me wonder if I’m actually losing my memory or losing it and replacing with fake memories for some reason. I’ve been suffering from anxiety, depression and bi-polar issues my whole life. That’s the only thing I can remember from the past I know happened.

The person with more of the connections was holding a pair of scissors and was cutting into the connections, and I think was showing experiencing pain from doing so, while the person with less connections didn't seem to be effected by it.

My head's always at the verge of exploting. My psychiatrist recently took all my meds away, since I told him I was fine. I have been on meds for about two years and I always wanted to quit them, since I hate being medicated. That's why I managed to do it, even if it's through lying. I felt like I could do this on my own. I wasn't feeling that bad, tbh. That sick. Now I know, it's not about what I felt or thought, it's about what I wanted. I wanted to quit meds so I did. I'm that kind of selfish person.

I am a sophomore in university. I have had a traumatic childhood with an alcoholic mother. I have been diagnosed with A.D.D. I have extreme OCD to the point where I feel like I have to rearrange my room and organize my drawers and get rid of things that don't ""look good"" in the drawers and make my room perfect before I can focus on any homework or studying. I am currently ruining a dream of being an engineer by toasting every chance I get to get good grades by fossicking around. Even after making my room perfect and throwing away useful things just to be more minimalist, I end up not being satisfied with what I have done. Even when I leave the room and go to the basement I ruminate about my room being perfect and that I'd only be able to do homework if I can sit in my room when it looks perfect. My ritalin prescription for my A.D.D. only makes the obsession and compulsivity even worse (stimulant). I struggle to focus when I'm not on ritalin though so I take it anyways. I don't know where to start but I know for sure that there is a fix and I'm willing to do anything to fix it. I dropped two of my four classes this quarter because I hadn't put the time into them that was necessary. I go home for winter break in two weeks for a month, which is where I was thinking of starting my therapy because I really want do well next quarter (quarter starts january 6th).

I had a guidance counselor at school I would see regularly, and I admitted to her that I wanted to commit suicide. I asked that she didn't say anything to my parents, as I don't feel comfortable with my family knowing that kind of shit. She promised to keep it between us, but my parents confronted me that same night. I played it off as me being a dumb kid and not knowing what that actually meant. It wasn't mentioned again, I stopped going to guidance, and I have never spoken to anyone else about my depression. The closest I've gotten is my friends knowing I deal with it. I really only have 2 friends I talk to, but I just don't feel comfortable enough to reach out to them for this level of help. I don't know why. I really don't even know how to talk about it. I guess I don't even know where to start anymore.

I felt psychologically mutilated, but no one believed me - and in fact the more I shared about this on any online platform, the more abuse I got, or people would get even more reactive (which I do not understand - to me, if someone is opening up about something vulnerable, I wouldn't want to make it worse). I don't want to...go there (the worst possibility - I think you guys understand what I mean), but I feel hopeless since I was taken advantage of, feel my head has been bashed in violently and people keep taking advantage of my insides spilling out, making it bloodier, messier, some on purpose (which I cannot detect) and some by mistake, I dunno. I am not shrewd enough to understand any of this. My family also explained to me that I am too ""pure, innocent, good"" and that I was taken advantage of. The downside of this is that I do not comprehend how what was done to me was wrong, and also the gaslighting contributes to not being able to trust my won judgment.

Obviously the rest of us were super concerned. Idk if she actually went through with it. At one point she had scissors, but she said that she didn't actually cut herself.

I just tried to be as supportive as I could. I know it's not what you're supposed to do but I feel like they put so much effort into telling me that it would be betraying their trust.

People who are experiencing psychotic episodes remain **fully conscious**, they **feel** relatively the same to what you and I feel every day, their continuity of events and logic seem intact to them, and if you were in their situation, you would believe everything they believe too. The fact is that the things they experience may seem weird or unbelievable but associated facts such as the way hallucinations explain things to them and speak to them lead them to believe what is happening is real. Hallucinations are very believable and uncannily intelligent. They explain events through logic, not so much magic, they lure you in and once you start believing them (because, for example, what they explain and offer to you, like in manic episodes, is very tempting and you would like to believe in it) you stop questioning them so much and stand on top of the logic which you have already accepted, taking it for truth and starting to attribute new things to the world around you based on what the hallucinations have made you believe. This is a trap many people experience and it is very easy to get into. Think carefully, **how could so many people not believe that they are ill when they have illnesses such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder**? The fact is it is just so **believable**. Hallucinations, feelings, and logic explain everything to them in a way that would be believable to you too, so they think or are trying to believe (e.g. grandiose delusions) that they are real and they have no disease.

What everybody is thinking, on the other hand, whether consciously or unconsciously is that people with psychosis experience the world differently and thus try to “guess” weird ways of dealing with them. What is, on the other hand, the correct approach to dealing with a person experiencing a psychotic episode is to understand that this is a human being, fully conscious, fully aware, with just a different set of logic and beliefs based on assumptions that are not valid. The logic is intact. Just the facts are wrong. Hallucinations give you wrong information which is very believable and then you start making assumptions using normal everyday logic about what is going on, attributing new and new things, until all the world in your perception is different to what people without psychosis experience.

For example, when dealing with psychotic patients, people tend to often be very wary and apprehensive to them. They tend to be afraid of what they’ll do, what they’d think, so they treat them similarly to what a prisoner who is going to jail would have been treated as – under constant suspicion that they are trying to do something wrong or to escape, or are thinking bad thoughts. In reality, the patient is experiencing a form of distorted reality. They may see the world with a lot more paranoia, so if you treat them suspiciously, or you force them to behave, they would believe that they are being apprehended and held against their will, or that people are hiding things from them and are trying to harm them. The best thing to do in a situation like that is to just be completely honest and open with the person. For example, a law enforcement officer/paramedic could talk to them in the following manner:

“We need to do this \[like take you to the hospital, give you these meds, take you to this room, etc.\] **because** of this and this reason. \[ALWAYS explain everything you are doing and say that you are explaining it so that it is clear to them.\] (Give them your name and inform them of your profession. Build a rapport) The reality of the situation is that we are not trying to harm you. We are just trying to help. If you have any questions what so ever, please ask us and don’t just assume. If you are assuming bad or scary things, it is normal, please do not feel afraid or keep it in, you can tell us and we will help if we can. We are here to help. If you are unsure of anything, feel free to ask. If you’d like us to do something for you or to stop doing something, please tell us. Right now, we need to take you to the hospital where a doctor may see you. This is absolutely normal and happens to a lot of people. If you are afraid of why we’re getting you to the doctor, remember that everybody goes to see a doctor when they are ill. Like when you get a really bad flu or aren’t feeling too well, you’d go to the doctor to make sure everything is okay. This is what we are aiming to do right now. We are just trying to help. You have done nothing wrong.”

A simple way to remember the difference in the experience of psychotic patients and non-psychotic people is to think of the brain. When you experience psychosis, not all of the brain goes haywire, only a part of it. A part related to a certain aspect of beliefs. Once those beliefs go wrong, the rest of the brain tries to fit reality and logical explanations into those beliefs. The logic psychotic patients use is intact, however, some of their beliefs are faulty. As mentioned, the faulty beliefs could be attributed to very real and believable hallucinations, such as voices or visual hallucinations. For example, if you woke up one day, somebody knocked on your door, you opened it and had a conversation, would you believe it? If yes – you are the same as a person with psychosis, the only difference is that the psychotic patient saw a hallucination. Same goes to auditory hallucinations, they try to use what people believe against them. For example, religious hallucinations use the fact that God can speak to you and try to use that (but only after they have convinced you that it is actually God or a divine being trying to help you or humanity) to make you do things or believe other things, based on this original belief. Since people do not generally understand the course and aspects of mental illness, they tend to not be prepared for the fact that what they are experiencing is actually a hallucination, which is highly manipulative and believable. Sometimes it takes many days, months, or years until hallucinations get you comfortable enough with them and the information they are making you try to believe in settles in. They take their time and seem completely believable, but in reality, they are cunning and manipulative in a highly believable and intelligent way.

The reason so many people stigmatize psychotic people is the fact that they have not experience what a psychotic person has. Another reason is that psychotic people tend to be on medications or suffer from a lack of ability to explain the situation and their beliefs to others. If you think about it – if you have been manipulated for years into believing something, have difficulty expressing thoughts through words mainly because of medication, or the hallucinations have used feelings to manipulate you, it is nearly impossible to explain the whole situation to another person. A fact that shows this is that we don’t have words to explain the intricacies of a lot of our feelings or beliefs, even though they make us act in a certain way. When you see a person on TV with an opinion that they can’t explain, but strongly believe in, it’s the same thing – we believe our feelings, feelings are a product of the logical calculations and assumptions the brain does and we don’t usually have a full explanation in words, unless we carefully think about it. In fact, feelings are known to be a collection, or an ultimate opinion if you’d like, summing up all of the things the brain has considered into making a decision. The last sentence refers to the hypothesis of Damasio about the somatic marker hypothesis ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio\_Damasio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Damasio)). Also, the areas of the brain involved in the production of words and expression through writing and speaking, evolved separately from feelings and are not always able to explain our feelings fully. A new finding showing this is that the brain actually simulates multiple dimensions of information from the bottom up every time we think, thus starting from basic facts and calculating the information in multiple dimensions (up to 11, or more) and then producing a feeling that sums those “calculations” up ([https://www.sciencealert.com/science-discovers-human-brain-works-up-to-11-dimensions](https://www.sciencealert.com/science-discovers-human-brain-works-up-to-11-dimensions)). Words however, are limited to our 3d world, they are a product of our environment since we need to be able to name something we experience in order for there to be a word for it. Think about it, why does it take a whole sentence or several sentences to explain the meaning of some words for feelings? Because feelings are a product of analysis on several dimensions inside the brain and can hardly be explained in words, which evolved separately and not to such a high degree. Another example is moral judgement. Believe it or not, it is mostly based on feelings. A simple example is the trolley dilemma ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley\_problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem)). So, what happens when you try to make decisions about everything solely through logic and words and ignore feelings (or have lack of them)? Psychopathy and spectrums of it, since we can’t explain everything the brain knows and rely on facts that are less evolved and a product of logic gained through words. You lose the inner meaning the brain holds in those extra dimensions and you are stuck thinking in dichotomies. Either something is good, or it is bad, or it lies in between. The brain, on the other hand, handles things on many more levels, like the superposition of quantum mechanics, sometimes things are more than one thing at a time. Don’t believe me? Well observe yourself when you try to explain something to somebody, especially about your feelings, you would use so many different sentences trying to explain a single emotion or belief (still an emotion, just not labeled as such widely) because they are multi-dimensional and consist of a lot of things. When you are talking, you see a lot more than the words you hear, you don’t hear a typewriter in your head typing out the words one by one leading to a belief, you feel the belief and you hold it whilst you explain it, with all its intricacies and multidimensionality. “Putting things into words” Is basically trying to convert from 11d+ to 3d, a certain level of compression occurs and information is lost. This is why you hear all those weird stories about those weird beliefs psychotic people have had, a lot of the information is lost and they just seem gullible at best, because for one thing or another, they are kept “mute” about their experiences. They might be suffering on the inside with no way of explaining it to anybody and are just shunted away and stigmatized. Like a prisoner in their own body, they have no way of escaping or gaining the sympathy of others simply because society doesn’t understand what they experience.

So, the next time you think of somebody “not in touch with reality” remember that it is a lot more complicated than this. This is a really in-depth insider’s look into it and not a lot of people are able to say it out loud when they have psychotic disorders, especially considering that not a lot of them get educated in Neuroscience, Neurology, or Psychiatry.

This message is aimed to help those suffering from psychotic disorders and to reduce stigma associated with them. I hope it helps those in need of explanation, support, education, knowledge, or advice.

171,She has fallen back into a psychosis. I just drove her to the hospital but she refused. Is there anything else I can do?,03Dec2019,1
172,"I was diagnosed with ADHD years ago, which although is much more complicated and variable than just dopamine , dopamine is supposed to play a big part , which drives behaviours, addictions etc 

Over the past few years 5+ I've had issues with restlessness and paranoid thinking patterns. 

And the only thing that really gets rid of it is a dopamine high , that puts my brain into a dopamine fuelled haze, and nothing matters I'm not worried about paranoid delusions and I can relax.

When the dopamine buzz wears off and I'm start thinking more intune with reality , the feeling restlessness returns and the thought patterns .

Can anyone explain why a lack of dopamine might produce this and why a dopamine high seems to relieve it ?",03Dec2019,1
173,"Ok, so I'm 17 years old from the UK  and have been severely depressed for the last 2 years. I was bullied and had 0 friends at school so that led to me not turning up to school at all which is illegal here and my mother got fined about £400 because of this (I payed most it back to her).
I then got 0 GCSEs, I did do most of them but because I had missed out on other work, I failed everything (I used to get A's all of them time prior to year 11). My mom thought I was depressed so she took me to the doctors at around December 2017, and apparently I didn't have depression according to the doctor (I knew I did though). Ever since then I've been feeling worse and worse, a few months ago I cried myself to sleep just thinking about how much I dislike life, I've never had a girlfriend, I have no friends, did shit at school, my family never speaks to me (all of my family deleted me off Facebook), I never had a job at the time and everything was just shit.
Fast forward to now and I still feel like shit, I recently found a job at KFC and I've only been there 2 days and I already hate it. Now I just think to myself, what's the point in me living? I wake up, then go to work, come home and then do fuck all for the rest of the day. Sometimes I do think about just ending it all but I still have a little bit of hope left I guess. Does anyone have any advice of which direction in life I should go? I don't know what to do with myself.",03Dec2019,1
174,"recently i’ve noticed i look forward to going to sleep/being in bed everyday the most put of everything. i watch a show or youtube for like 2 hours before i can sleep, and if my video pauses or something i get extremely anxious bc all my worries catch up to me. recently i find it hard to get up or enjoy other ppl’s company.

i am naturally an extremely stressed person bc of other factors (parents, academic pressure, college application stress this year). 

but at the same time i’ve always felt like this, different variants of it. in middle school, i remember i felt like i was depressed even tho i probs wasnt. i cried myself to sleep a lot.

in freshman yr, i felt lonely because i couldnt have human connections (parents dont allow me to spend time w friends), but now i feel unmotivated in even school because i dislike myself and the way i grew up, and im too tired. i hate talking to people but it makes me sad all the same. it feels like im floating though life without any ties",03Dec2019,1
