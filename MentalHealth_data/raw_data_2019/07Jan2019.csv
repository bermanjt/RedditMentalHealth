I haven’t spoken to my mom or step dad or really any other family in 72 straight days. My mom doesn’t miss me and she never asks where I am or how I am doing. They don’t care that I’m in another state and a different family now has to feed my mouth and make sure I’m okay because she couldn’t care at all about me. I wish they cared. I wish my family cared about me enough to at least ask about me. I have no friends here I don’t know anyone. I left highschool and I’m having a hard time finding a new job. I sit alone in this stupid basement all day long. No one to laugh with or talk to and no one to vent to. I’ve started venting online to randoms for help and advice but my position I’m in is so dramatic people think I am lieing for attention. I never wanted it to get this bad. I never wanted to be 17 living from basement to motel 6 states away from my abusive family. I just want help I just want someone to talk to and to just please help me and be my friend. I’ve tried apps and online stuff to meet with people but I only get bullied for over sharing my story and people tell me i better keep acting my boyfriends sex is good or else he will kick me out on the streets and other horrible things like that. I just want someone to talk to. I can’t just dumb all of it on my boyfriend he already stressed about me because I spend all his money on food and gas and tampons and toilet paper ect because my parents don’t take care of me.

1,"I feel like I have no energy and yet I've continued to struggle and try my best even at my worst and although at times I get small victories and I feel somewhat motivated it all goes away again.
I can't keep going in this cycle and I'm so so tired of finding my way back to the beginning, I keep losing progress and I'm just really tired of it. This is the most empty and tired that I've felt in my entire life and quite honestly I don't really even have the energy to right this message, yet I am.
I'm tired and every breath uses motivation and now that all of my motivation is gone I'm finding it hard to breathe.
I can't stop thinking of finally just killing myself and stopping it, I can't stand feeling this hurt over random thoughts or just nothing. I can't stand feeling tired despite doing nothing. I don't know what to do because I've tried everything I can and more options will open up for me in the future but I can't wait that long. 
This world isn't for me, I don't think I was made for it and it feels like my body is rejecting it. Even if my tiredness and my random pains left, I still don't think I'd really be happy but it doesn't matter because no matter what moves I make I always find myself back to the beginning. No progress whatsoever.

2,"Hey there!

I'll start off with quoting a post of mine from 5 months ago in /r/offmychest:

&gt;Hey there!  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;It's weird to write this post.  
&gt;  
&gt;I  just happen to mostly spend my time here on reddit or some other sites like YouTube or keeping reloading news sites for more content, listening  to music. (Or you know, pleasure time.)  
&gt;  
&gt;I wake up, browse some reddit, wait for the day to go on, keeping procrastinating while browsing the internet.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's  just the same day in, day out. I feel like I am wasting my time. What's  even weirder is the fact that my mind does not really want me to play  (singleplayer) games, since they are in fact very time consuming and  feel like ""a concentrated effort and commitment to waste X amount of  time"", but on the other side I don't even want to waste it so I cannot  even wholly enjoy spending my time there. Although when I count together  the hours I've wasted so far here on reddit I could've played a lot of  games without really getting less from it. (Playing multiplayer games  with people I know is fun and fine in this regard however).  
&gt;  
&gt;I  am studying computer science and could learn something new every day. I  could spend hours and hours on programming projects like some years  ago, I could schedule some time for learning for my exams (which I  always start way too late, but unfortunately it so far also works out  really well nonetheless).  
&gt;  
&gt;I got stuff to  do, I need to clean my room, I need to learn for a subject (maths) in 2  months, I'll ideally very soon (this/next week) need to start on  deciding on my topic for my bachelor thesis, which will probably be  something which is almost complete new territory for me and will require  a lot of effort without knowing beforehand how well I will be able to  consume all this new knowledge, whilst knowing that I have previously  done so successfully in the past.  
&gt;  
&gt;Instead  I am here, procrastinating, waiting for the day to go over and wait for  tomorrow to magically change. For that sudden energy and motivation  boost. Right now my brain does not even want to be bothered with  challenging and/or new stuff.  
&gt;  
&gt;Also, this  feeling comes in waves. There are periods of days or weeks where I feel  rather like shit with some wasted potential, feeling behind, feeling  like I just don't even know anything and wondering how my past me always  surprises me by what it has achieved in the past, and also in the  recent past, but it just feels so unreal; and there are periods where I  feel content, super happy and pleased with my life, looking back at  previous achievements and how positive other people perceive me and how  in the general sense life is going great (studies are going great, I  have a nice future ahead of me, I am healthy, my parents, grandparents,  brothers &amp; everyone else are alive).  
&gt;  
&gt;And  still there are days like today where I just want them to be over, so  that the days can come again where I am productive, working towards a  goal and feeling good again.  
&gt;  
&gt;Whatever, this is something I needed to get off my chest. (It got quite a wall of text suddenly.)  
&gt;  
&gt;I know this is not permanent, but I also know that it's very real right now.  
&gt;  
&gt;I  appreciate any replies from you. Maybe from people who were in a  similar situation once and got out of it, maybe from people who are  still experiencing a similar feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

I just reread this today and it's as real as ever, with every sentence hitting the nail on the head.

I still haven't really began diving into the topic of my bachelor thesis (hoping to start within the next few days) and I've skipped writing the math exam last year - now I plan on writing it on January 29th (hoping to start learning within the next few days, too).

I've got asked to (re-)participate in a side project (not related to my studies) in November, agreed to put 1-2 hours of work in per day (on a voluntary basis) after vacation at the end of November, had troubles to really start working on it (like understanding the framework we use), then here and there I got interrupted with some things, and as days passed and guilt rose up I've consciously avoided booting up Discord again to avoid confrontation since December. The project originally started last year for a short amount of time but was laid on ice first, and even in this period I was slow to get started. The project leader is really someone I look up to as a person (he is great socially and skill-wise), and it feels miserable to disappoint him in such a way (again). I just don't know how to get out of this situation - I'd like to participate, but just don't feel like I am mentally capable of because of all the reasons mentioned in this post, and at this point I cannot imagine of what he might think of me since I've left him (and the others) in the dark since December, like I just disappeared from earth.

&amp;#x200B;

Subconsciously my mind is getting packed with guilt of not getting my shit done (and on time), having a feeling of despair at times on how this could ever change.

&amp;#x200B;

I figure I have a hard time dedicating a block of time to a specific cause, probably because my subconscious mind  goes like this: 

*""Do you really want to commit X hours into doing XYZ? You have other stuff to do, too. If you focus your time on doing XYZ now, this time is not being spent on ZYX. Soooo.... let's wait for the day to go over and wanna restart tomorrow again?""* 

While I fully know that this kind of logic makes absolutely no sense, it seems to be somewhat accurate.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: I've got a huge procrastination problem and it drives me nuts.

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried reading up on meditation and mindfulness. I realize I just need to start. However when it comes to actually acting on that, I fail. I've got the skills, I've got the time, yet I fail.

&amp;#x200B;

Just needed to get his off my chest, sorry for the wall of text.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help is deeply appreciated. Thank you very much!",07Jan2019,1

4,"I want to really be there for an ex, as he was there when I went through a major depressive episode. However. I have these feelings that I can’t quite shake. He cheated on me a few years back and continued to maintain contact with her despite me asking that he discontinue interacting with her. I eventually broke it off and we got back together, agreeing to work on it. He continued to maintain contact with a new girl after we made an agreement to work on us. There was just this lack of respect that made me grow to hate him. There were several things that bothered me in our years together. And it’s not like I’m not without fault. I’ve shared with him that I needed to work on myself and if I didn’t I would certainly continue to ruin what we have. I’ve been so unhappy with myself that I’ve taken things out on him. I’ve felt like I have taken accountability for some of the really mean things I’ve said to him. And I’ve admitted that I couldn’t change my faults for him. We are just too toxic and codependent. I know I can’t make him get help. I want to be there, but I feel that I’m drained. I’ve spent the last four years working with a specific demographic of people and the past five not being able to escape work when I got home. I just feel that he’s manipulative. 

After breaking up it took me a while to process things. And now I am definitely certain that I’ll never be in a relationship with him again. Part of me believes that I need to stop our interactions period so he can move on. I feel that by me being around even for a brief period time is bad for him. Do I show support or do I ghost?

5,"So my mental health has always been pretty shitty.

After a 7 year relationship ending things took a turn for the worse and I ended up in a psychiatric unit due to concerns about my suicidal plans.

Since being discharged I've been to A&amp;E/ ED three times for various reasons.

One of the things that was keeping me going was a girl I met on the psychiatric ward and we started a sort of relationship.

However she has decided (I think upon advice of the nurses/ doctor) that neither of us are mentally well enough to build a healthy relationship together.

Deep down I know this is probably the case.

But it just leaves me feeling empty again. I don't really know who I am without being emotionally involved with someone else (I think this is why they have diagnosed me with emotionally unstable personality disorder).

How do you even begin to build any form of self image when you haven't been with some sort of partner for the best part of a decade since you were 18?

I'm not to the point of cutting but I really want to. My therapist said to do something less destructive to feel pain. For two days I have just been snapping rubber bands on my arm really hard and I acted like I was cutting with a sharpie to get anger out. My arm is bright red from using the rubber bands on it. I feel neutral to doing it, not like I want to or don't but I keep doing it. The pain doesn't even feel bad to me anymore. I don't even react to it almost. I keep doing it. I might want it, I might not, I don't know. Right now I am doing it almost out of boredom. Constantly I am thinking of just cutting or something. Idk why",07Jan2019,1
7,"Recently, perspective on life has seemed to be the common theme in my analysis of the source of problems and successes in one's mental health.

A *huge* component to keep my mental health stablized is enjoying the little things in life. One day while I was in high school it hit me, like as if I had actually walked into a window, that the day was beautiful and the air smelled so nice, and I needed to enjoy that moment. I actually ended up writing a speech about it because it had been such a significant event.

And so today, I sit here in my crippled body -- talk about depressing triggering -- with stressors all around me. Yet, I'm relatively OK because my cat looks adorable sleeping on my knee. The Christmas tree is beautiful and brings up feelings of comfort. I have shelter. I have food. I appreciate all of this.

Maybe I got this from my grandmother. We recently discussed this and she has the same perspective as I do. She is 93, and she focuses on enjoying everything she has. She views every day as a gift. Every experience as a gift. She accepts her death soon, and does not mourn or fear it. She sees every moment as a gift. I'm somewhat similar in viewing her mortality: I accept she will die and do not fear it. Every conversation with her is a gift.

The two people I'm working on these days are suffering from their perspective. My father-in-law is suffering suicidal depression because life isn't working precisely as he believes it should work. My husband is burning out trying to help his father from a strong sense of filial piety. Their perspective is torturing them. 

My husband deals with other perspective issues, too. He often focuses on the bad. He *never* takes a moment to enjoy something unless I specifically point it out to him. Oh, and our cat. Our cat brings him much joy.

This theory mostly relates to depression, I suppose. I theorize that there is a line, or quick gradient, and if we're above it we're not depressed, and if we fall below it we are depressed (my theory of antidepressants is that it can move the line down, making it easier to stay above it). Each positive experience bumps us up, and each negative experience pulls us down. This accumulation of little joys (cute cat, a smile, fresh air, warm food) helps to keep us up above the depression, and to counteract the pull down from significant depressing events.

I suffer from depression. I think my bar is naturally quite high, so it takes a lot of little joys to keep above it (either that or my life is just hard with a lot pulling me down -- I definitely suffer situational depression). When on antidepressants, it's much easier to stay above the line. 

My husband, on the other hand, is never above the line. He's been surviving through depression for most of his life. It's here where I think perspective is so important: he has so very little that will give him a bump up. Instead, everywhere he turns is another thing to pull him down. He is consumed by feelings of obligations and feeling he's about to collapse under the weight.

I believe the cat and I are significant towards keeping my husband afloat. He *loves* the cat. He can't help but have his heart flutter when he sees her adorable fluffiness. And she is a good cat, so they have good interactions together. I just merely love him. He forgets, often, that he is loved. I am an obligation he has, so often my mere existence is percieved is burdensome. So I remind him regularly that I love him, and every time it's like it's the first time he's felt loved. He only has brief moments when he realizes the value of a good partnership. The rest of the time his head is buried under a constant inflow of obligations -- most of which he creates himself.

He has other perspectives that keep him up. He enjoys meeting good, smart, hard working people and networking with them so he can fantasize about a future where he works with them all on a new company he creates. That's a good perspective.

My father-in-law is a perfect case study on how perspective on life can destroy your mental health. He believes in a strict system. Men are served by their wives. Men die young so they're never alone. A man's children, especially his daughter-in-laws, will serve him if his wife cannot. This perspective is consuming him into a black hole. He doesn't have any of it. He's so angry at me that I can't serve him to his high expectations that it's destroyed our relationship. One son, the golden child, has abandoned him. The other son, my husband, his scapegoat, is the only family member left to dote on him. But since that son is the scapegoat, everything he does isn't good enough. He feels *everyone else* is negligent in their duties to serve him. And his constant disappointment continuously pulls my husband down to firmly keep him in the realm of depression.

My husband believes that he *must* earn his father's respect. He believes if he just works harder he can get his respect. But his father will never respect him because he only views my husband through the perspective of being the scapegoat. His brother is still viewed as the golden child by his father, despite that he communicates with him just once a year. My husband can't see that it is impossible to earn his father's respect. He can't let go this perspective of life that he must earn his father's respect.

I feel changing my perspective has been a life saver. I've basically just... let go. I've let go of any expectations. I've let go any want of possessions. I've let go social standing. I've let it all go. I just float in the river and appreciate whatever it is that comes my way.

I've let go of any perspective that could pull me down.

This is not to say that *perspective* is the only thing one needs to fix their mental health. There's still other work to be done, and hell, work to maintain the new perspective. But it seems, at the very least in the case studies I am observing, that perspective is the cause of their problems.

I still suffer anxiety, explosive emotions, fear rejection, and risk so easily dipping into depression over the smallest thing. My husband is a huge vibrating ball of anxiety. My father-in-law is deeply insecure and self centered. Even my grandmother isn't freed because of her perspective, she has severe black and white thinking, golden/scapegoat child issues, and very likely avoidant personality disorder.

I guess with my grandmother and I, even though we still suffer mental health issues, it's easier to stay out of the goo of depression. My husband barely realizes that there is a possibility to get out of that goo, and his father is just rolling around wallowing in it.

Then comes the next part of this exploration: how do you help someone to change their perspective?

Oh god I wish I knew. I wish oh so wish I could help my husband. Unfortunately, my change in perspective moved faster than he could keep up so I've left him behind in terms of our mental health. It pains me so much to see his suffering. I wish there was something I could grab hold of and turn so his perspective contained more light than darkness.

And for goodness sake do I wish I could completely abolish my father-in-law's perspective of a sex-based caste system. I wish I could shatter that perspective to pieces. Then maybe he'll see he has to dig his own way out of his hole. As someone once described it, ""His son has jumped into the goo with him to help pull him out, but he is angrily pushing his son away because he expects to be pulled out by a first class helicopter with a shower, fresh clothes, and a gourmet meal."" Yup. My father-in-law definitely needs to let go of that perspective.

I wish I knew how to help someone change perspective. How do I put that thought in their head? That inception. 

The only thing I know that I can do is stay away from my father-in-law and push my husband towards professional help.",07Jan2019,1

14,"I have a lot of trust issues with people.... so this is hard for me to see logically... 

So long story but 8 years ago, I ended a friendship with this guy I worked with. Well, actually he ended it.... we were only friends for a few months but talked daily and had tons of fun. A really stupid issue related to another job we both tried for, ended up ruining it all. He blocked me from social media stuff and told me not to call or text anymore. I was confused and hurt and angry, it took me about 2 years to fully work though my issues from this

About a year ago, he randomly added me on FB. I'm nice so I accepted. However it was odd because he never made any contact. Not even likes or comments on anything. So I kinda just ignored it

Well a few days ago, I reached out to a mutual friend we both still have on FB about a dog related question (he's a dog trainer) and anyway my old friend reached out to me, he said he saw the post and even though it wasn't for him, he wanted to tell me he has a friend who has a blind dog and trains dogs. Said he was willing to try and help if he can

Anyway we chatted about 10 min, he told me that he was really upset to hear about my dog dying last year and he has followed his FB page (my dog has one) and that he would love to meet up and I could meet his dogs and he can see mine, we chatted like no time had passed and nothing changed. It flowed easily and all that. 

So...on the one hand, 8 years is a long time. He could have grown in many ways.... and could legit be wanting to try friendship again..... but on the other hand, I am nervous because I feel like he will hurt me again. My trust issues got really bad after things went down with him.

23,"Dear redditors, 

A little heads-up; I usually lurk Reddit, the story will quite possibly be long-winded or dreadful. Sorry if this is the case. I will do my best to be as clear as possible typing this out! If you have a question, want me to elaborate on something, or want me to correct something please let me know!


I have been dealing with a burnout for the past 8+ months, which has since helped me develop insomnia and a minor depression. My psychiatrists current hypothesis is that the insomnia is the biggest problem at the moment, keeping me from recovering well and resulting in the minor depression.

Since acknowledging that there was more going on than mere stress I have been really motivated to get on top of the situation, pulling trough numerous sessions with different psychologists and psychiatrists and the heinous waiting periods in between. Going on finally seemed to pay off halfway through November, because that was the first time the actual hypothesis was set(?). Since the hypothesis I have been enlisted in the waiting period for group therapy for my insomnia. A month and a half later I still haven't heard anything.

A common theme since reaching out for help has been a lot of irrational guilt. When I first reached out to the psych I felt guilty for not being able to fix my situation on my own. For taking a spot at the psych, while there are people waiting that are in way worse situations than me. For not being pleased with the help I received from said psych. Later I also started feeling guilty for receiving food packages from the local food bank. For receiving social assistance for freelancers. For telling the people close to me I'm ""still not doing fine"" for months and months in a row. Etc etc. I think you get the gist of it by now. 

The stupid thing is that I know that most of these are irrational, but despite that i can't seem to shake this feeling of guilt. I feel like a fraud, feel like I'm cheating the system, feel like I'm always complaining, feel like I'm ungrateful for not being happy with the help I'm receiving etc. 

I can counter all above with rational thought, I know that it's okay to not be able to get trough this on my own. I know that I deserve a spot at the psych as much as he next person, and that I have every right to be critical about the help I receive. I know that the fact that I'm getting the social assistance and food packages means that my current situation is bad enough for me to be considered for the support. And I know by heart and constant validation that my friends and family don't mind the slightest bit that I talk about still not being in the best of situations at the moment. 

For some reason I can't connect these rational thoughs to my irrational feelings. If anyone has a bit of advice that would be much appreciated. 

I hope the 'essay' above is somewhat comprehensive. Thanks for taking the time to plow trough my shitty typing skills, hope I didn't bore you to death!

26,"since it's 5 am and I haven't gone to sleep yet, I'll copy my previous post in r/music which offers background info &amp; anything ya need

 

The last time I was truly captivated by an album was 2-3 years ago. I listened to Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and I was blown away by it. I enjoyed it so much that I played the record again after it had ended. Even though it might not seem such a big deal to some of you, since then no album made me feel that way again.

y'know

that feeling when you're so captivated by a record you just forget about yourself, about your issues and your life, and idk you're breath synchronizes with the track's rhythm and you get shivers and it ***just feels so amazing and beautiful and fucking good man***

I haven't experienced that in a long time. Actually, I sort of did, but it only lasted for a couple of songs, after which I lost my interest for the music.

For example, yesterday, I decided to give Morbid Angel a try. The first track of Altars of Madness was hypnotizing. Yet by the album's third track I was bored.

And (roughly) the same goes for Iron Maiden, Eluvietie, Death (Symbolic got me pretty hooked though, almost finished the album), Dissection, Metallica, Nightwish, Emperor, Burzum (actually Filosofem pretty much offered me the same 'climax' Sgt. Pepper gave me but it had that 26 minute long synth song which turned me off.)

Any advice? My headphones are fine (audio-tehnica ath m40x), I usually download FLAC tracks, and my laptop does a good job at delivering the sound. I might also have depression, but since I'm 17 my parents won't take me seriously ('it's just a phase' 'this is how teenagers are') so the only therapist I could get is music.

So I’ve had my fair share of depression—borderline suicidal, not getting out of bed, not taking care of myself, disassociating—you know: depression shit. 
It always comes in waves, big 2-6 week periods of hard depression and then roughly the same time period of crazy mania. I’m not medicated (ik,ik) but I try to actively push myself in healthy directions. 

The last month has been manic af and then a few days ago I got hit with some personal shit and dropped into depression full tilt. Today I woke up—fought every urge to stay in bed—and called my friend. We walked our dogs, and had a great day.

- I'm afraid to leave the house, because if I leave, it could get robbed, or maybe it'll be on fire when I get home.
- I'm afraid to use the car because I'm afraid I'll do irreparable damage to it or kill someone else if I make a bad decision driving.
- I'm afraid if I take a job in the city over, that something terrible will happen. Maybe we'll/I'll crash, maybe I'll/we'll get mugged, maybe I'll/we'll be killed, maybe the house will be robbed or destroyed while I'm away from it.
- I'm afraid if I drive other peoples cars I'll crash them  accidentally by making a driving error.
- if I have passengers I'm afraid we'll crash and theyll be hurt because of me

But for the past year i have been obsessed with passing out. It occupies my thoughts probably 80% of the time I'm awake. My thoughts are usually ""it would be awful if i passed out right now"" or ""imagine if i passed out here and how bad it would be"" 
Sometimes it gets so bad that it can trigger a panic attack. I spend alot of time avoiding situations because i don't want to feel this way. 

I recheck my work bag so many times before i set off to work, once in my apartment and once again when I'm sitting in my car. And then again when im in my work parking lot.

I've also noticed other things I've done in the past that i think are strange..such as spending over 3 years praying everynight to a god i don't believe in. ive stopped doing this now but looking back it seems so odd to me.

So.. the problem...

This week i have had 2 major ""episodes"" (one being last night) where i can only describe as a living nightmare. After it happened the first time i told myself that this isn't right. 
I was trying to sleep last night when it happened again and after afew ""waves"" i got out my phone and wrote down what it felt like.

(This is the unedited version)

""Its the feeling of being trapped and bounded up and struggling to get out the sudden erg to drive my finger nails down my arms as hard as i can and thoughts of self harm like cutting my self

Just a moment in time then it happens again in 2-3 more waves

What lead up to it 
Asking god to open my eyes and pleads for forgiveness then sudden thoughts of self hate then rushing thoughts and the feeling of not being in control 
Then it happend""

41,"I suppose I'll start off with I grew up pretty normal for a middle-class family. My family was very nuclear and conservative so I feel that I grew up a little more sheltered than some (but I was public schooled my whole life). My life changed when I experienced a lot of deaths in my family and a few classmates when I was fifteen. One of those deaths was my mother. Ever since then, I have stepped up and helped my dad and sister, almost in an adult way. I worked just under full time while in junior year of high school and even graduated early that year. 

I'm now 20 and have been in and out of college due to panic attacks and an injury (unrelated to mental health). While being on my own at college and being independent and doing what I want, sometimes there is a part of me that wants to move back home and just live at my dad's house and be taken care of. I've talked to my therapist about this and she suggested that since I felt that I had to grow up so fast, I am now subconsciously mourning the ""normal childhood"" I missed out after my mom passed away. I was just wondering if any of you had any other third-party insight on my situation?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR My mom passed away when I was 15 prompting me to step up and help with adult duties in my family. Now that I'm 20, I love my independence but a part of me just wants to live at home and be taken care of. My therapist says this is me subconsciously mourning the fact that I grew up too fast.

In this dream, it was the 22nd of February 2007, that date goes in my head a lot. I would've been 5 years old i think. I was at my grandfathers house i believe, i was running down a hallway in the middle of the house, gosh it felt like hours. I have no clue where my parents were but i think a large man was chasing me. After a while, my dream then jumped to me in my grandfathers room i think, i was lying on a really big bed. There was this shadow silhouette of a person was looming over me.

I didn't really focus much on what was going on, i just remember this horrific pain inside my no no spot. I honestly have never felt anything like it, like i was being cut in half. It's usually after that part when i wake up.

Now, i really don't want to let this come across as crazy, but it's not the first time I've seen silhouette like figures in my day to day life.

Up until now it was bad, yes, but bearable. Recently though it has been tremendously harder and I have been struggling very hard with feelings of self purpose and worth, anxiety has skyrocketed off this planet, depressive episodes, spiking bipolar feelings, intrusive thoughts, and at some point something snapped and I realized things had gotten very very bad without even realizing it. Which I realize sounds a bit silly.

Now that I’m on my company’s insurance, I am actively reaching out and looking into getting professional help, which still freaks me out a lot inside because previously it was always my dad sending me to therapy for one or two sessions and then stopping because he saw no progress and felt like he was wasting money. Which has always been a personal struggle because I don’t like being a financial inconvenience. I have also been struggling with the thought of being on medication for these struggles because one of the sources of my trauma is substance abuse of a parent. Either that, or that I will feel no difference and still feel miserable as I do now. Every time I’ve ever looked into getting medication I haven’t felt anything and then felt too bad to ask my Dad to take me back because it would be costly. 

I guess this kind of turned out to be a vent but I was wondering if anyone else could give me some hope that medication would actually help at all? I admit I have issues that I need to resolve with therapy but I do feel like some of it truly is beyond that and I should be medicated.

and it's always there. i can't run away.  i see every situation as overwhelming. i'm apathetic, i give up easily. i learned from living with my toxic dad that all you can do is not focus on his foulness, let him win, and hope he's satisfied his ego for the night so you can retreat in the safety of isolation. so of course i dissociate. it's the only way i learned to survive. i ignore all of my problems as long as i can and hope they go away. if i distract myself, it subjectively isn't there.

i can ignore the hollowness in my head as long as i keep myself distracted but i have the urge to hit my head in both places. they seem to feel hollow because there's no activity there. i have to literally slap myself back at least within an inch of reality.

haha. i'm really going insane, huh? i wonder if this cognitive decline slides down far enough one day i'll wake up a fleshly robot, my conscious reduced to nothing. ",07Jan2019,1
55,"Hi,
I dont know how to explain this without sounding off but I dont have a psychologist or any other place to explain my problem and seek help so hopefully you guys might have some suggestions.

I [19 M] rarely remember my dreams but recently I have been experiencing the same dream in which Im walking through a field with three people. Two of the people are my friends. A boy and a girl. I dont recongnize who they are but I can feel they are my friends. There is also a second girl with us. And she gives off a negative vibe. As we are walking through the field this girl will shoot my two friends in the head killing them and then shoot me in the chest. I wont feel like I have been shot but I fall to the ground and cough up blood. Then my dream will end.

I dont know why im having this dream or why its happening multiple times but it scares me and doesnt feel right. I dont know what to do. Thanks.",07Jan2019,1

Mental background
•ADHD
• Possibly bipolar (therapist suggested it and my mom has it)
•Depression



So to start I have frequent 'panic attacks' (in quotes because I don't exactly know what they are) I constantly get in this mood where I can't think clearly and start fidgeting around, punching the air, screaming or saying random words and phrases, sometimes I run around the room or just fall to the floor like my legs don't even work, strangest part is, to me it feels like its my choice, its not 100% involuntary but at the same time not 100% voluntary, its kinda like my head is iust like ""hey, it would be real cool if you fall right now"", and im like why? But at the same time like ""why not?"" And I just end up feeling crazy, sometimes I bang my head against walls or just lay in one place for like 10 minutes without moving just cuz

If anyone could provide any input it would be much appreciated, thank you",07Jan2019,1

60,"It's most prominent in video games, as far as I've seen, but also in writing and profiles (Reddit accounts, emails, etc). The 'tick' or 'trigger' to start over is most often naming or progress based. If I refuse to answer to it, I feel a kind of conflict, or cognitive dissonance. 

I have played hundreds, if not thousands of hours in certain video games, but I make little progression in them before I delete the save and start a new one. In Civilization 6, I have 200+ hours, and I've only completed one game. I easily have thousands of hours in RuneScape, but the highest level I reached was 60... And I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say I probably have a hundred or more different accounts, the majority in levels 3-40. Here, it's the progress and name that most often drive me to restart. I begin to think about the early stages of the game or where I failed at a certain. Often, also what happens is I feel my progress has become disingenuous, even though it's irrational. I can sometimes push past it long enough to complete something (that one Civ game, or the (relatively) high level character in RuneScape), but *overwhelmingly* more often than not, I'll give in and start over.

In writing, if I make a mistake (in pen), no matter how small, I'll discard the paper. The same goes if I don't feel I've aligned the page up 'correctly' (again irrational) -- I might change my mind how the page should be organized, and instead of sucking it up or working the change in, I'll discard the whole page. If I don't, I'll feel that dissonance.

You start thinking about something stupid you did earlier, if someone misinterpreted something you said, about work problems, about the fight you had with a significant other/friend/family, maybe that exam that's tomorrow, or anything else.

Lay down with the lights off. Invision a piece of paper and a pen (feel free to get creative). Now, gather every single thought or topic you can't get out of your head and write it on that paper, creating a list. Take that list and now also invision a candle/lighter/fire. Hold it above and slowly watch it burn it to pieces. Breathe. It does not exist any longer in this moment. Let it be nothing.

67,"A little background:

My doctors over the years tried me on a few antidepressants. Zoloft made me fat. Abilify made me black out. Effexor shut my emotions off. Welbutrin gave me back a full range of emotions, amplified. Then I was put on Rexulti. (I piggybacked it with Prozac while I was inpatient, but took myself off because my anxiety was out of control.)

My psychiatrist thought it would be good to taper off the Welbutrin, then run some blood tests to figure out exactly what seretonin receptors are misfiring. (or something like that.) In that moment of (for lack of better word) ""detox"", I was hit with an emotionally traumatizing bombshell. I cried from Friday night through to next Friday morning. I didn't eat. I barely slept. I cried from the crack of dawn until I eventually passed out from exhaustion. I've had similar experiences before, but never such raw emotion. I've never dealt with a situation like that without meds. Tuesday morning I had my therapist, who was able to push my psychiatrist appointment to the very next day by the Grace of God. (I was off work at the time dealing with an unrelated Kidney stone.)

Dr. K fudged the bloodwork and threw me on Rexulti. Without exaggeration, after 2 doses, I was in a significantly better place. I woke up by the third dose and didn't feel like crying. I was... Stable. A feeling I'm not all too familiar with. I was exponentially getting more and more stable every morning. By the time I finished the first sample pack, I was more stable than 3ds firmware. (A little bit of r/3dshacks humor.) I didn't bloat. I had a full range of emotions. I wasn't hyper-sensitive. It was great. I ended up going inpatient because (metaphorically) if a car is driving straight and you let go of the steering wheel, it'll eventually hit a bump and swerve off the road. While inpatient, they took me off my antianxiety (which I didn't think was doing anything anyway) and put me on Prozac to piggyback the Rexulti, because, while Rexulti kept me stable, Dr. N over there didn't think it was doing enough. Ended up giving me paranoia-level, out-of-body anxiety and I took myself off. But I was doing great on the Rexulti. Dealt with a different trauma and ended up going up to 2mg. But I was doing absolutely fantastic. 

I felt like what a normal human should feel like. And I was functioning. I had to go a week one time without it, but there were no physical withdrawal symptoms, which is a blessing and a curse. I hated Zoloft because you had to take each dose within like 16 hours, Effexor was 24 hours, amd Welbutrin was 48 hours before the ""brain zaps"" and headache kicked in. Rexulti, I don't *feel* anything, but my emotions began to unravel a little. I had to cold turkey in late-June and haven't been able to go back on anything since. I was doing well without them until about mid-November when everything exploded and I'm not functioning properly anymore.

Anyone else deal with Rexulti before? Is there anything similar that might be cheaper? I know it's an evergreen version of Abilify, but they didn't react to me like the same drug.",07Jan2019,1

71,"I've recently came out of a break up. One of the biggest reasons of a break up is because of my mental health. My ocd flared up for the first time and just took me out for a fucking hell of a ride. My (ex) partner got tired of me always having to *confess* my intrusive thoughts because it made me feel guilt and just crippled me to the point I feel chest pains whenever I talked to them or thought about it. Anyway, don't blame them for wanting to leave (even though I was the one who broke it off for their own good) as they tried their hardest to understand me but due to some reasons, I and my situation is also not good for them. They have their own issues (health and so) to be concerned about that just makes it hard to be with me and accept my condition. 

I also just recently realize (2018 november) that my little 'quirks' and ""vivid imagination"" could be ocd. I haven't had an official diagnosis but after tons and tons of research and this flare up of intrusive thoughts, anxiety attacks and worsening compulsions, I am convinced. 

&amp;#x200B;

So back to the subject. I've basically confessed every intrusive thought to my ex. Even when we broke up three weeks ago, I've still confessed after. We don't talk on a daily basis but til now we still keep in touch. It was also a **very messy** break up. Lots of hurtful things were said (more on their part but I understand cause I have previously fucked up and put some trust issues way before my flare up)

Basically we talked again today and even before we talked today, i still get thoughts but they're a little manageable. Thing is, my brain was like ""okay well, since you've said everything lets create some things to torment you"" and immediately my mind directs me to this thought:

""Maybe if your ex dies, you'd feel less anxious and sad or not anxious and sad at all.""

and **immediately** I deflect that thought so hard and violently. I hate it. I hate it so much. I don't want my ex to die. I love them so much, I still do. I still care about them, if anything I ask them how they are from time to time when things are calm. They are so lovely and were lovely to me. I don't want them any harm. 

Yes, I've been somewhat anxious they're going to move on with somebody else or before me (which is somewhat okay) and I don't want that but fuck, not to the extent I wish them death. I DONT WISH ANYBODY DEATH. Even the people I hate the most. it just feels mean and evil. 

&amp;#x200B;

Especially not my ex. I love them so much. I can't believe my brain would everthink of that. My problem here is when they message me gain since we're in the middle of a somewhat serious conversation about closure. I fear that my urge to confess (a compulsion) because I feel guilt and frantic will come up. Honestly, they're the only person I feel this way about like I can't calm down til I confess to them the guilty thought thats related to them. Anybody else, i can shrug off but not them. **I don't want to tell them about the thought because:**

1. It might make them feel bad and feel like I don't love them or wish bad upon them. I don't, I just want whats best for them but I don't think they understand how my brain works now. 
2. They might overthink about it. 
3. We're already somewhat okay. Like they weren't as angry at me like they were 5 days ago. i don't want to fuck up and have them NEVER talk to me ever again and that be the last straw. 

Someone please help. My OCD is flaring up again and I think its cause things are turning out okay between us. Thing is it also bothers me when things are not okay between us. I dont know hwere to place myself but I just don't want to lose my ex all together at all. Like unreachable at all but i am willing to stay away after we talk some closure for us to move on but im afraid im gonna feel restless til i confess the thought and fuck everythin up once more.

72,"I feel like my dad has anger/mental issues. Why do I think that? Well first of all, he's hit me a lot and my brother and very rarely he hits my sister as well. He also hates my mum so whatever my mum does, my dad starts muttering to himself in anger. Last night, my dad was helping my brother do his science fair project but the type of project he chose was 14 years old level and so my 12 year old brother was struggling. My dad and my brother spent a total of 5 hours on understanding how the project works and the physics behind it but my brother obviously didn't understand much. And so in the living,downstairs, my dad started shouting and slapping my brother head and back multiple times (I could hearing the smack from my room which is located on the 2nd floor). I felt really bad for my brother but at that time i was so ill and head a 39°C fever so I couldn't be asked to go downstairs and start arguing with my dad. Even if I did I would get told of for doing bad in my high school UK graduation exams (GCSE). Just to let you know i got 6 As, 2 Bs and 1 C, which is higher than the average national GCSE score I think and the fact that I revised the night before for all my exams I think I did a decent job 😂 but obviously I really need to stop being so lazy. Anyway, it was the next day and I was clearly in pain because of my high fever and sore throat, and my dad comes into my room saying that i've gotta go to college. I tell him that my mum's made an appointment with a doctor to sort out my fever and sore throat but my dad suddenly starts sighing and muttering in anger again and slams my door... like does he think i'm trying skip college? I'm really concerned my dad could have anger issues and he's always been quite physically abusive throughout the years. Like He doesn't hit me or my siblings very often maybe like once every 3 or 4 months and I don't exactly fear him much and I do like him because most of the time he buys me anything i want (yes... i'm quite spoilt xD). But i'm just worried my dad could have anger problems and maybe even being bi-polar? He acts very angry sometimes and then after 30 mins later he can be super nice. He's told me that he would've been nice to me if I had ""Good Grades"" but because recently i've got a Cs and Ds for my college grades he's been quite strict. I gotta admit that I should really start revising and stop being lazy so that i can get into university but I think hitting a child/kicking a child's back is a little too much. I really don't think my dad hitting me left a mental scar for me but back when I was a bit younger I used to flinch whenever my dad raised his arm suddenly if though he wasn't going to hit me. My brother is very clumsy and when he tries to pour a drink into his cup, he often spills the drink everywhere and my dad would get extremely irritated and called him a retard. He would often raise his hand up to act as if he was going to slap him and this resulted in my brother fearing my dad (e.g. he would also start flinching like I did whenever my dad raised his hand). I've had conversations with him before saying that hitting a child isn't normal but he would always answer back saying that if he doesn't act scary we wouldn't listen to him. Many asian parents would beat their child back when my dad was a kid so i guess that's why he acts like that. I don't even know what is right or wrong but I still believe that hitting a child is definitely in the wrong. (And yes my dad is asian lol)",07Jan2019,1
73,"Long story:

I had a big trauma in my life back in 2014 (when i was 14). Family was undergoing near bankruptcy, father was overworking. And he isn't a mentally matured/stable person. So on 3 separate occasions in 2014, he tried to kill me with a knife, strangled me and chased me. I didn't do anything wrong, he did all those just because he was irritable and wanted to vent his stress out on someone and that was me. All while that was happening, i was being bullied in school (teachers had to escort me whenever school was over because possibility of high school gang members coming to find me was real), i had no help and no one to talk to, nobody on my side. I remembered the time when i was deadlocked by bigger high school seniors, pushed around the stairs and harassed by them constantly. All when that was happening, my 'friends' and girlfriend betrayed me and talked smack behind my back which eventually made me disconnect with them back then. I was basically alone, at home i am afraid i will die by my father's hands, i can't sleep well, i can't live well and i can't be myself anymore. At school/other social life, i fear for my own life from bullies, fake friends and etc. I am once again alone and fear that i will die. 4 years+ have passed, and now it's the beginning of 2019, i could never sleep well, nor be myself at all, very afraid that i will die everywhere i go. 2 days ago i broke down and had a mental breakdown, the trauma is unlocked again and came back like a dragon that was once asleep. I had been suppressing it and slowly masking it, but bottling all these finally led to an explosion that i could not have imagined. This mental breakdown led to my all my close family members finding out and crying and repenting in front of me about their mistakes and how they didnt save me when i was 14.

I'm not sure that this is the correct topic but here we go:

I'm (F 22) currently in my last year of uni, so all the big and final exams are coming. My uni has a free psychiatrist that students can go to, and I was thinking if I should go or not. I've never been but I think that, in our day, everyone should visit a psychiatrist from time to time at least.

I've kinda always wanted to go and I really think that it would be good for me, due to many reasons like how I'm only with my mom because my dad died a while ago, I'm having trust issues in my romantic relationship because of the previous ones, I'm having a hard time making new friends and tolerating people in general, I might be a little depressed, etc.

As I said, I've never been and I'm afraid that it might get awkward or end up with me crying, which I do not want lol.

Should I go? And if yes, how should I approach this? How do I tell my sorrows to the psychiatrist?

And although I do ""well enough"" in mensa IQ tests they still give me a headache, specifically the 

pattern based tests even at the very beginning of the test, things that are dead obvious. Like

""1,2,1,2,1,2,x"" and the possibilities are x=1 or x=921. Like I understand that whoever made that 

question thinks the answer is ""1"" but I utterly fail to understand why. 

Just because they repeated like that before doesn't mean that X necessarily has to also be ""1"". Or with

the pictures where you're supposed to choose whichever you think comes next, it frustrated me endlessly

because ""which one should come next"" is not a real question to me

although dumb, at least ""which one should come next from an aesthethic point of view"" makes sense as question

So what I end up doing is asking myself ""which one do they think is the one that should come next"". But

inevitably I fail. 

&amp;#x200B;

And now I am dealing with philosophy and stuff like "" If it is true that if P then Q,  then P is a sufficient condition for Q""

and I again I am endlessly frustrated. That's the very first question after a couple non-abstract ones related to 

sufficient and necessary conditions. And I fully understand sufficient and necessary conditions and got through the

non-abstract ones like a breeze. Yet I can't get through this one (even though I know it's simple) even after watching

2 videos about it, and couple of other internet explanations as well as the one provided by my professor. 

I just can't answer the question without first understanding fully what P and Q are and what the question even is here,

I can't even move with it even after seeing the correct answer. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It am not being obtuse or anything, I seriously can not understand abstraction like that. It's like something

is missing in me that other people have or something is broken. I know I am not terribly stupid as I got

to a university and do well on many  tests.  But this just throws me off so much.  Just every time 

there's a question but it's not a complete question which dictates what I am supposed to choose based

on and is directly related to reality I find it nigh impossible to answer. This is a problem to a certain degree on most test, If I don't just get stuck on questions like that, I'll follow a completely different logic stream and end up at an incorrect answer, which I nevertheless can justify as being correct even after seeing the actual correct answer. It doesn't seem like I am able to pick up on the ""obvious"" things.",07Jan2019,1

I always feel anxious and sad in the days leading up to a session. I'm bad about keeping regular appointments because until recently I didn't have a regular work schedule, and truly couldn't schedule ahead. Is what I'm experiencing normal?

84,"Hi there. I am a 28 year old female with anxiety, and have recently been diagnosed with High Functioning ASD. The hardest part of dealing with this on a day to day basis is work.

I work part time Mon-Fri, 4 hours a day in the afternoon. I feel like this is all I can work as full time hours would be too taxing for me. Hell, some days I feel 4 hours is too much!

I love my job. Nice quiet office job, get on with my colleagues (although they don't understand mental health as well as I would hope) and it's good pay. However, whenever I get ready for work in the morning I get rising panic. So much so that I want to just scurry back to bed and hide and never go out again. 

I know these are extreme feelings but I am struggling to cope. My boss knows of my issues and is supportive but I still feel like I am letting people down when I ring in sick because I ""can't cope"". Sometimes I go in because I don't have the courage to phone in sick, and I would never just not turn up or not give notice.

I need support. I want to live a normal life. I want to be able to do a 20hr a week job without panicking every day. I have no idea where to turn. I can't ring the support lines because of my phone anxiety and there seems to be very little online chat options.

85,"So I’ve been dealing with this privately on and off for something like two or three years.

I know it’s dumb to bottle this up and not talk about it but I just don’t know how to do so without gushing it all out which is going to hurt.

It all started when I was a freshman in highschool and got into a near death experience. I distinctly remembering just thinking, “I’m fine, why am I fine? I should have some sort of issue” and it’s almost like that triggered the depressive episode I went into for about five months.

This was when it was worst and it felt like a pit of numbing, emptiness would well up in my chest and not go away for at least a half an hour unless I distracted myself with music or funny videos or something else. 

It was awful. There were distinct moments where I just couldn’t do anything except cry and I had mini panic attacks inside my head in school. Usually crying helps get stuff out but even the tears felt endless and didn’t help, at all.

One day after a shower and a particularly bad wave of it that wouldn’t leave I just went and hugged my mother and cried. Didn’t explain anything (in a sense that she could understand) but I cried and she held me and we just sat next to each other and watched TV which essentially ended the episode for me.

I thought I was mostly fine except ever since when I feel the slightest bit of that badness or sadness welling up it feels like if I don’t distract myself again I’m going to immediately slip into that more severe sadness again. I’ve been emotionally walking on eggshells for years and it’s awful.

I find it helps to get out of my own head and do stuff that keeps me busy and not able to focus on how I feel inside. Unfortunately my school life and just daily activities do not, in any sense, do this much for me at all.

I just want to be okay again. I just want to be able to feel sad or bad and not have it feel like that depressive wellspring. There’s a VERY distinct difference between how it felt to feel bad and how it felt to be depressed.

I’m terrified and don’t know what to do. It’s why I’m extremely scared to go to college. I know that is going to be hard for a while and I feel like the slightest discomfort or longing for home is going to set me off again.

Please, PLEASE, someone tell me what to do. I’ve tried to ask for therapy before but never in a serious enough way to actually schedule something. I’m scared they won’t be able to fix me. 

I really need some advice and any feedback would be appreciated.

86,"I've always been a coward. Ever since I was a little kid, I never had the balls to do anything major on my own, never had a girlfriend, always got influenced by others and even now, it feels like I'm watching my life unfold like a horrible movie in front of my eyes, unable to do anything about it, unable to even get my shit together to kill myself. 

I've been a drug user since I was 12 and had meth shot up into my veins for the first time a few days ago. I feel horrible both emotionally and physically. I am totally isolated from normal people apart from having to watch my parents endure me being a total retard of a son who should have never been born. 

I have flesh-eating mold in my lungs that traditional meds have been unable to cure and I'm physically addicted to Valium, after countless attempts on tapering and failing because sooner or later I either take a huge dose or fuck it all up with alcohol or some other benzo. I am an impulsive, disappointing and sick mess and a huge part of me really, really wishes that I was dead already. Yet being the fucking coward that I am, I don't think I'd be able to go through with it unless someone was willing to kill me. 

Isolated, sick, frustrated and tired, I don't know how to go on any further. I can't see much of a future ahead of me and I've always felt like I was going to die young - just by intuition. My parents don't deserve the disappointment of a son that I am in any form, any longer, I'm causing them a lot of suffering and I might as well just die, so that they'd get over the grief after a while and not have to sink slowly along with me. I really do want to die. I don't know how to do it though. I would probably jump under a train right now if I got really drunk. I'm looking for a little last bit of advice maybe on how or why I should keep on living any longer, and I'm asking for it over here since I have no one to talk to anymore.

88,"Hi guys, I just found this sub. I’m really happy it exists. I needed to ask for advice since I’m currently not on health care and can’t ask my previous psychiatrist. But I’m in the process of renewing it! Hopefully I’ll be covered again by February.

I’m 24, F and I take 20mg Prozac and a quarter of a 0.5mg Klonopin pill every day (I was really paranoid about becoming dependent on a high dose so I insisted on cutting the pill and 0.125mg was still very effective.) I take them for generalized anxiety and panic disorder. I had been in a good place for almost two years. For the last 6 months, I was tapering super slowly and in mid November I quit completely. For about a month I was mostly fine, with some manageable anxiety here or there, and I thought it was all part of the process. But 3 weeks ago I walked into an Urban Outfitter and the room felt distorted. I felt dizzy, my body went cold, my hands were clammy. I turned around and walked out immediately. I was supposed to take the railroad to my boyfriend’s but as I started walking through the streets, I felt too nervous. The area gets extremely congested, and suddenly I couldn’t make myself walk through the crowd. I took the subway home, trying to calm myself the entire way but I had all these racing, irrational thoughts.

Since then, I’ve been nervous about going outside, being in the busy part of my city, taking public transportation, etc. I went back on my medication, which used to be so effective, and it’s been 3 weeks but I still feel...off when I go outside. These are all symptoms I dealt with initially that I was able to fix with my medication and CBT, so I’m trying to get my health insurance back so I can go back to therapy. I really regret tapering, it was dumb and unnecessary especially without my psychiatrist’s supervision. I heard that if you unsuccessfully taper and you go back on your medication, you would need a higher dose to get the same benefits as before. Is this true?",07Jan2019,1

91,"I will keep this as brief as possible, I am not sure if I want to vent or am grasping at some vain hope of someone offering a useful partial solution.

I am 30 years old and in the UK.

I have suffered from anxiety issues since I was 5 years old, I thought anxiety was the normal way people felt until it started to cause large social issues around the age of 18. My typical issues are: panic attacks, a need for routine and specific execution of activities, avoidance of certain types of contact, social withdrawal and general catastophising of the pedestrian.

I sporadically worked during more stable periods of my adult life, but after my last period of employment I went onto benefits due to my illness for the first time in my life.

I had to partake in an assessment. The questions were tailored heavily towards physical ability as opposed to mental ability to do things. As such, they told me I would have to go back into work, or appeal to a tribunal. It is worth noting that for the past few years I had left the house for social reasons next to no times at all, and the thought of standing infront of people and pleading my case was too much to bear. How exactly do you talk about this to strangers when the moment you make eye contact with someone you can ""see"" all of the bad things people thinking about you.

I went into self employment, as a way to tailor my social situations to be those that are favourable, with mixed success. And then it happened, a single person criticised my work, and I cannot do it any longer. Whenever I work, I approach it with dread, my heart rate is elevated for entire days. I have been unable to dare open letters for years, for reasons I cannot rationalise, I have not been able to fill in my taxes even though I had never earned enough to be taxed. My bank account closed and amassed additional charges due to these issues. I work maybe one day a month if someone contacts me, and it socially drains me for days or weeks after.

I attended the doctors a few times recently and asked for help, I explained my difficulties making my issues known and stated my discomfort, he dismissed my claims as nonsense as he was understanding me fine, apparently. In the past Ii had used SSRIs and beta blockers to attempt to handle my situation with no positive result (unless the goal was to sleep all day for months and be unable to orgasm) and had entended a CBT course of treatment for an extended period. He put me on SSRIs again leading into the same side effects and an extremely out of character and (poor) suicide attempt.

The final time I attended the doctors, the doctor said that he could offer no other medications and that ""I am aware of my problems and will address them before they become a larger issue"". Address them fucking how exactly? I have requested a telephone consultation with a different doctor but have 2 week wait time.

I contacted helplines to ask about advocacy (but apparently need to be sectioned to qualify) and just other places I can go for help. I contacted citizens advice and they could offer no support in addressing these issues, nor any useful contacts.

TL:DR 

Can't fill in my taxes due to anxiety.

Cannot treat my anxiety due to anxiety/side effects/trivialisation of my condition.

Have one good productive day (today) every 2-6 months and spend the rest of the time doing the bare minimum to live, relying on the charity of my family.

I honestly at this point have started to fantasise about suicide, I do not plan to do it but I see no other recourse if the not paying taxes could result in prison time (I don't dare look it up). I see no ways to address my issues.

92,"-I will mention anything in which I find important in the story.

Basically, two years ago I lost my pet bird. The thing is, I was obsessed with birds all through childhood because of my bird. He was pretty much my only friend and I still have sketchbooks filled with birds. I bought everything bird related and what not, but you get the point. Now, when my bird was lost my parents didn't seem to care. I got extremely depressed for about 3 months, crying and not wanting to do anything productive. 

Another thing is that my parent's relationship is bad, but sometimes it gets to the point where I don't want to be near them when they're together. My mom has told me that she's going to separate from my father soon. This has impacted me because my father was in my childhood for most of my life. But at the same time my mother suffers with his BS daily so I feel like a bad person not wanting to. Sometimes my mother has broken down and has broken through my windows. 

Six months ago was the happiest time of my life. I had conquered social anxiety which I had been facing for 3 years, and I had gotten into a great relationship. I was able to make friends easily starting the new term. I didn't really think much about my parents or my bird at this time, occasionally I would think about it and cry a little, but fall back asleep.

As the year progressed, one out of three of my friend groups started to drift apart. It's also important that they are my closest friends. I feel really bad about it but I try not to think about it. My boyfriend helped me through this. 

The second friend group was cut by myself after noticing that I was not liked by them. Basically, they never wanted to talk with me and gave me the stink eye whenever I did. They called me annoying and when I talked to them about this they called me crazy. I stopped talking to them and I felt terrible. One of them shit talked me and made up rumors but my closest friend didn't seem to care. She kept hanging around her and that just made me feel worse. 


I had a shitty professor that gave me an F for my test which ruined my grade. It's a really long story, but it was really unfair because I had worked so hard on it and that made me break down a few times and from there on I honestly hate going to college. 

At this point I had almost no social interaction on a daily basis. My boyfriend was busy with his own college and work, while I was busy with school. School seemed so meaningless at this time. I would skip many days and I felt bored out of my mind there. My boyfriend still talked to me for a little bit. From here I started to feel really weird about my boyfriend.

Basically, I started to question whether he was honestly busy with college or he was just lying because I am a pretty boring person. There were Saturdays where he wouldn't message me until 6 pm. I don't even know why this bothered me. I know he is a busy person and he doesn't have a lot of friends. And I know that he cares a lot about me. Still, I kept doubting him. I started to get bothered by the smallest things. For example, sometimes he would ignore me when talking with his friends. I felt like a terrible person for feeling bad about this but at the same time I couldn't anything about it. I got angry at him for not being able to read my emotions. There was no need for me to get angry if I never told him about what bothered me. Everytime I got angry, he would apologize and try to change himself for me. I broke off our relationship because I felt like I was too emotionally unstable and got bothered super easily. He told me that he didn't care if I wasn't perfect and asked me out again. I really missed him during those times and so we went out again. 

I kept getting bothered by the little things still, but except I talked to him more about it. He didn't judge me and tried to fix it. I would honestly occasionally get a little jealous when he would talk to his friends more than me. I don't know why I still feel like this. I was friends with his friends. One day, one of the friend he talks to a lot was rude towards me unrightfully, and I told him about it. He agreed that I was right and that his friend made a mistake. The next day my boyfriend kept talking to her like if nothing had happened and that just made me feel terrible. I felt as if he didn't care about me because he never really defended me. I told him about this and he apologized. He was confused on what to say and he promised me that he would say something. When he did, nothing really changed but I'm glad that he did.

Right now, he still talks to her the same as before. I am cruel and manipulate wanting him to stop talking to her. I know he loves me very much and just sees her as a friend. Still, my feelings don't follow my thoughts at all and when I try to control them they just get out of hand. I get upset when I find him texting her in a group chat when he's texting me at the same time. It makes me even more upset when he takes longer to respond because he's texting in a group chat.

 At this point, I clearly know that I'm a terrible girlfriend and person. I over analyze everything and don't stop thinking about it. The fact that I don't have any friends either doesn't make it better. Right now, it's 5:31 am while typing this. I wasn't able to get any sleep last night for 4 days in a row. At first it was because of them, but now I don't really know. It could be everything mixed in and I don't know wtf is happening in my brain. When I go to sleep, I don't think of anything I just feel extreme sadness. I lay there in my bed, trying to sleep. I just cry and cry for no apparent reason. I don't want to go to my classes anymore and I'm so scared to lose my boyfriend because everyone else was lost in this year. My question is, what is really affecting me? And what is wrong with me? Why do I keep getting these feelings that don't belong, and why can't I control them? And lastly, what is your advice to me? I'm afraid this is my last resort because I haven't had any sleep in a while. And physically and mentally, I feel like shit. Thanks for reading this depressing essay and I'd appreciate some help.

93,"I am sitting in a bathroom stall in the university I graduated from bawling out. I’m at my breaking point. Again. And I want the hurting to stop.

I took a day off from work. My fourth time for this school year. I made an appointment with my primary doctor in a few hours just so I can cover myself with a doctors note this time. I may have broken before because teaching is hard, but it has gotten easier. This school year isn’t that bad. So, why am I crying so much today? Do I not like my kids? Do I not enjoy teaching?

I thought this was what I wanted to do. But I don’t want this. I struggle to do anything. I get praised for growing as an educator. I am dying inside though.

I felt so much joy doing an emcee job for family during the winter break. I missed feeling that kind of enthusiasm and passion.

It’s not the medication or the therapy that I want right now. I want a voice to tell me it’s okay. It’s okay if I don’t want this anymore. That I did enough for the kids. That I’m not garbage for saying I can’t teach anymore- I’m tired. I love the kids and I want to help everyone but I’m tired. And broken. And losing my passion. I want a job that won’t tear me apart.

96,"So for the longest time I have played hockey with this girl who completely hates me. Everyone including myself have absolutely no idea what sparked this resentment. (There is a standing theory that it came from me scoring on her during warmups. But this would be bizarre since that is the point of warms up. To receive quality shots). But it started from almost day 1 with her (playing for her high level adult organization) and culminated with me getting blacked balled to a lower division team everyone in the organization agreed I had no place in being on (I was the leagues leading scorer by double as a result). 

This year a bouncy of girls including myself broke off with this club and started our own new organization. As we were all fed up with her crap (what happened to me didn’t cause the break up but was what broke the camels back). 

Since then we have played them multiple times and she has shown little effort to hide her resentment for me and the other girls who used to play for her in our organization. Going to far as to slash, trip, and scream at us whenever we get close to her. On top of that as to emphasize the point. She actively avoids shaking out hands at the end of a game in the lineup with that exact purpose (which is a big sportsmanship deal at all level and ages of hockey)

I ha e begun to think that there is no way this pattern of behavior is just her as my teammates say being a “bitch”. It makes me think she has some variety of mental health issue and was wondering if the “brain trust” here had any insightful thoughts or speculation as to what could cause this extreme pattern of behavior. As she has a habit of treating anyone this way who she doesn’t like or feel has “betrayed” her in some ways. Even though more often than not it’s a completely irrational feeling. ",07Jan2019,1

98,"In November everything was amazing. I thought I had only very minor social anxiety that I have learned to cope with over the years and have found ways to overcome some of those anxieties. Ladies and gentlemen, I had no idea what anxiety could be in November. At the beginning of December I woke up one morning, took my pills, got sick and puked them all up for seemingly no reason, and then went to work feeling like crap the rest of the day. Long story short, I got sicker and sicker feeling every day for a week until I figured out I felt so beyond stressed that I hadn’t even recognized it. I would literally wake up at 3 in the morning and puke until midnight on the worst days before I would pass out from exhaustion. It got to the point where I could no longer take care of myself, let alone my dog. My parents drove all the way up to my place to come get me and my dog to take care of us for a while while I got better. I will never be able to express how much it meant to me that they were so willing to take me in and care for me like that. I felt so small and like a little child I was so helpless and they were so willing to be there. I have been blessed with loving parents. 

I’m happy to say that after I figured out That what I was feeling stressed and anxious the nausea began to fade. I’m finally no longer in those stages, but because of the illness I missed a lot of work and I wasn’t sure when I’d be able to come back, so I was laid off due to the extended illness a week before Christmas. When I lost my job my girlfriend thought it was a sign of weakness and a lack of ability to provide, so she broke up with me. That’s been one of the hardest things about this all. Is the fact that my mental breakdown took away two of the biggest things in my life. I tried working things out with my ex girlfriend but it only made things worse. She thinks that I’m faking this to run away from responsibility I guess. 

Anyway, I started a new job a couple days ago now and that’s going well enough. The only thing now is that I simply fail to find any meaning at all to life. On my days off the most intense thing I’ll usually do is take my dog on a walk around the neighborhood. I moved far away, so none my friends ever are able to come over and I’m rarely able to go with them. I left the religion that I was raised in last year so it’s hard to not have that sense of community anymore. I don’t have money, I’m behind on bills, sometimes I feel like I am not doing enough for my dog through this mental illness. I’m seeing a therapist and talking with doctors. I just don’t feel like I’m doing enough or getting better at all and I don’t know how much longer I can go. ",07Jan2019,1

I have a poor history with risperidone, as it caused severe weight gain. As I understand it, it's possible quetiapine would cause the same weight gain problem, but I've not experienced anything like it with my current medication dosages.

I'm also very depressive lately, and I've read that quetiapine can work as an anti-depressant.

In addition to this, I actually have a lot of times where I want to ask a meds/psychiatry-related question, but I understand that this probably isn't the exactly correct subreddit for such questions. Where could I ask properly?

102,"Hi guys, 

Was just wondering if anyone had any advice or insight on this issue. 

I suffer from depression and have some anxiety/stress issues related to this. One of the ways that my stress seems to manifest itself is in motor and vocal tics. This is something I have experienced my whole life, since I was a child: small movements or sounds that I feel absolutely compelled to do, over and over again, until it feels right. 

These tics come and go and I've had many, but the most common ones have been clicking my neck and jaw (often giving myself a headache), tapping my teeth together in a certain pattern, making a clicking noise with my tongue, and, most recently, compulsively humming certain notes over and over again. 

I'm a singer and this humming thing has become quite a problem recently - I often get a compulsion to hum a really low note at the bottom of my range over and over. This has actually caused me to pull muscles in my throat, affecting both my singing and speech. 

It's kind of an embarrassing issue, and it's something I mentioned briefly to a therapist when I was doing CBT for my depression, but not something I've ever really had any proper advice on and I'm not even sure what exactly causes it. 

So yeah, I was just wondering if anyone had any similar experiences or had any suggestions for coping mechanisms for this. Thanks :)

103,"I’m 29. I lost my job 6 months ago due to my deteriorating mental health and then I had a big break and got myself to change my mindset. Things were going well until the last month or so. 

I have been applying and interviewing and getting no where. This last month I’ve also been sick the whole month. First week of December was a bad cold. Then a week long colitis flare up. Then a few normal days and then the flu and now I’m in the bathroom after I eat within 20 minutes and odd aches and pains. 

My unemployment ran out and I am -45 in my bank account. No jobs have gotten back to me and I even got rejected from a free lance delivery job. I was lucky enough to have my parents take me back but like anyone would I feel they are getting tired of my shit as I am and I am literally about to lose it. 

Today is the first day I’ve felt suicidal in months and I can’t take it. I want to bash my head into the wall continuously because of how much of a failure I’ve become. I’ve lost so many friends not only because of my failure but because due to my past depression and alcohol abuse I did some very stupid things to people I deeply cared and still care about. Things that shouldn’t be forgiven because I betrayed trust and I accept that. But hearing that people that weren’t effected are still wishing bad things upon me usually is my motivation but nothing is going right. 

I am at my wits end and I just need someone to tell me everything is going to be alright. If not I think I might commit myself.  ",07Jan2019,1
104,"I honestly can't recall when I first started feeling unhappy. It's been a while. Lately though, I've been completely overwhelmed by hopelessness, and I don't know if I'm going to be alive for much longer.

My mental health is deteriorating rapidly, and I have no idea what to do. My friends and family aren't very understanding people, so I can't talk to them. I've been wanting to speak to a doctor about my mental health, but I am absolutely terrified that I'll be judged or not taken seriously.

It's had a pretty significant impact on my grades. Last year I was achieving A's in the majority of assignments, but now I'm struggling to even get C's. Due to this, I've lost motivation to do work. Everyone's telling me that I need to improve so that I can get the grades required to go to university in September, but I don't care anymore.  I don't see the point trying when hopefully I'll be dead by September.

I'm also finding it difficult to manage my part time job, which is in retail. I've had this job for around 8 months, but it still feels like I've only been there for a week. I'm still anxious about things I should be used to by now. I'm constantly worrying throughout the day that I've made a mistake that will get me fired. I leave work in tears after every shift. It's horrible, and I'm tempted to quit my job just to avoid the anxiety associated with it. 

What has got me concerned lately though is that I've started self-harming my thighs. I know it's an unhealthy coping mechanism, but I just can't stop. I don't even know why I keep hurting myself, since I hate having to find ways to hide my cuts from everyone.

Most days I struggle to sleep. Every night my mind is racing and I think about suicide. I know it's messed up, but the thought of being able to kill myself and make all these problems go away is relieving to me. I get to escape my problems, while people don't have to deal with me being a burden anymore. 

I don't know what's started all of this. My life seems great to other people for the most part, but I still feel terrible. What do I do?",07Jan2019,1
105,"TL;DR at the bottom. 

So a little background is probably important. I’m 25 years old but turning 26 on Friday and I am beyond terrified after the past holiday season. The last few years, nothing has upset me more than New Years because of all the expectations that go into the night. You’re supposed to find a New Years kiss, you’re supposed to have a resolution to better yourself, you’re supposed to go drink copious amounts of alcohol and ruin New Year’s Day with the inevitable hangover... And finally, the expectation that somehow your life will be different or changed for the better because of a change in year. I had plans to go to a party in Manhattan with some friends but decided last minute to cancel it and stay home instead and ended up in bed before midnight. (I can elaborate more on the things that happened over Christmas week that brought me to this decision to isolate myself, but I’m starting to get away from the point I want to make.)

The thing that terrifies me right now is the implication of turning 26. Health insurance. I had a very tough 2018 and was so depressed I ended up taking a leave of absence from my last job to participate in inpatient and outpatient programs for about 2 months. The programs were incredibly helpful and for several months I was doing much much better. But I was 25 and still on my parents’ health insurance at the time. I wouldn’t have been able to afford the costs of the programs I needed if not for the insurance. Currently, I’m working a fairly new job (about 3.5 months now) as a contracted engineer. Considering how recently I started at this company, another leave of absence (like with my last job) to prevent me from becoming more suicidal doesn’t make sense. I’m afraid I’ll lose my job and subsequently the health insurance that I will need for myself at the end of January. My parents have already told me that I don’t need to worry about insurance/money needed for treatments if things do lead to me losing my job because of my depression but that just fills me with so much guilt and shame that it just feeds into my suicidal ideation. 

So it pretty much feels like I’m on a deadline to “cure” my depression before the end of the month when I start paying for my own insurance. Because if I can’t afford the treatment I know I need on my own then I want to kill myself. 

And one of the worst things is I’m already doing so much to try and get better. I’m in therapy, I’m very open with my parents and a few close friends about my condition so I have support, I’m on medication, I’ve cut back on drinking and I’ve stopped smoking weed. I’ve signed up at a nearby gym and have even applied for a 6 week boot camp type fitness class that includes meal plans to meet people and keep me accountable for getting back in shape. I already know how important a healthy diet, regular exercise and social interaction is for me but I was officially diagnosed with depression when I was 18 and overall I’ve just gotten worse. Sure there’s good days but after all this time my mental health looks like a failing company on the stock market. I’m just filled with hopelessness and despair that things won’t get better. 

TL;DR: I’m terrified at the thought of being financially responsible for my depression and it’s making me suicidal. 

Anyway if you made it through all of that, thank you for taking the time to read my post. Every last one of you is loved and appreciated. If you’re struggling as much as me right now, remember just because I don’t see hope for myself doesn’t mean there isn’t any out there for all of you. Anyway, I’m not even sure what I’m looking for by posting this but I’m currently grasping at straws trying to get better so I’m gonna keep “shooting in the dark” for as long as I can still handle it. 

Welp, I should probably get back to work now. ",07Jan2019,1

I’ve been detained and they’ll let me go when I am no longer a danger to myself. The thing is, nothing in my life, or how I see it, is changing so therefore the suicidal thoughts won’t stop. 

They’re treating me with an antidepressant which is ineffective (it has been a month) and they’ve done nothing to help with my anxious feelings. I’m left in my room feeling very low and anxious and nothing is helping so I’m basically stuck here. I’ve attempted suicide multiple times on the ward and they deal with it by taking my things away.

Ok so I've recently gone to see a psychologist and will continue to see them for depression and anxiety, and it kinda made me notice weird things about me and I'm not exactly sure when they started. I think it's a mental thing and I've never heard of this happening to anyone else. I haven't tried asking my psychologist because I don't really want to look like an idiot and the internet is somewhat anonymous.

So every time I touch something without me actively trying to do so (like if I brush past a wall or if someone touches my shoulder, sorry for the bad examples) I have to scratch at that spot or try to rub at it, sort of like I'm trying to get clean? I'm not sure how else to describe it. 

Another thing is I have trouble trying to pay attention to things. Like in class I'll try to pay attention to the teacher or something and get distracted by a pencil and if I try to focus on the teacher again I focus so much that I'm not taking in any information. Or if I'm watching some show on tv I have to have something in my hands to fidget with or I'll play a game on my Switch.

I don't know if this is a mental thing or just me being weird, so sorry again if this doesn't belong here or if I'm just being a nuisance and also for how horribly worded this is, I'm not used to writing this much and English is my second language

Now pretend your mind is the earth. Pick up a new can and dispose of it properly. Everything that’s stressing you out is there. Each one a different can. You have one hand on the bag/bin of which to sort these, and another to pick one up. You keep going one by one.

None the less, as one does, the mind gets messy. There are cans all over the place again. That’s okay. You find yourself picking up cans not just one by one, but two at a time. It becomes more and more easy to do.

Sometimes you have you go back to one by one.

But one thing is for damned sure. If you don’t pick up the cans, all you’ll see are cans. Until it gets to that point you can’t see a way out. But never let that stop you. You can do this.

129,"This is long but I’m really hoping I can have support on this. I’m sorry for how long it is. 

I have horrible anxiety revolving around admitting when I’m not doing well and it’s because of huge fears of abandonment. I’ve always been tossed aside and labeled as the “bad kid” or the “troubled kid” in the family and I’m the scapegoat for so many familial issues. And when I was in high school, my depression and PTSD had gotten really bad and up to a point where I was in and out of hospitals. So at some point my mom decided that I should live in a group home (a therapeutic based one) instead of at home. I didn’t want to go there at all and I had arrived there three days before my sixteenth birthday. I’m a twin and it was the first birthday we ever spent apart, and even though we don’t get along — and fought even worse then — it was just horrible. My mom came for about thirty minutes and gave me a cake and some presents and I just stood there crying, begging to go home. After over a year, I was deemed able to go home but less than six months later I was back at the group home. Throughout the two years I was there, I was told it was because my mom just couldn’t handle me. And that I was too much. And that I had traumatized my mom with my depression (whenever I would admit that I had self harmed or felt suicidal). When I turned eighteen I was still living there and I had been under the false pretenses that i would be going home then, but my mom said no. By that point, even the people at the group home recognized that it wasn’t on me and that I didn’t need to be there. I just wasn’t wanted at home. My mom is a therapist and all of her coworkers and patients love her and say how amazing she is but it’s so hard to hear that because when it comes to me she acts like she has no idea what a mental illness is. She acts very ignorant. 

When I graduated high school, I was only allowed to be at home for two weeks before I would be going to a summer college program. When I got to the summer college program, shit went down and I was put into a horrible, horrible space mentally. I was retraumatized. I begged my mom to let me home every night on the phone. I would call her and sob. She never relented. She visited me about two or three times. I also begged my dad to take me to live with him but he was told to follow my mom’s instructions (even though they’ve been divorced for 13+ years) so he wouldn’t take me home, plus he thought I should stay at college. To be fair, I hadn’t told them what happened, but it was terrible. Finally, the following September, my mom let me come home. I entered two partial programs and then when those didn’t work I entered a residential program. 

There, we worked on a lot of family therapy and I talked to my mom about how abandoned I felt. She refused to acknowledge anything that I felt. When I was at the group home, I lived on her commute home from work but she would only visit me on the weekends, and I had actively begged her to visit me during the week. During the two years I was there, she only said yes twice. I talked to her about that in the family therapy, but she only scoffed at me. Then I talked to her about times in middle school where I would be stranded after school when I would join clubs because I had no ride home but meanwhile my mom was paying someone to drive my sister home (from a different location although same town). She scoffed again and said none of that was relevant. 

I also didn’t really go too into it but I feel a lot of abandonment from how she raised me. I felt very neglected as a child, I would often go weeks without bathing and days without washing my hair. And I was young enough for my mother to do something about that, but she never did. I also feel it towards when I was abused by my neighbor and she found out but didn’t go to the police. Instead, she yelled at the girl’s mom and the girl and that was that. The abuse happened two more times after that but she didn’t know. There were also other times I was put into an abuser’s hands under her watch, although no one knows about that not even her. 

But anyway, this all leads to how I’m feeling now. I’m doing horribly. I’m in a terrible depression, and not wanting to live. I am not suicidal, I just don’t want to live. My eating disorder has also incredibly spiraled into a bad relapse. I confessed all of this to my therapist and dietitian on Friday and we determined that I should either take a leave of absence from school or go part time. And then consider treatment. I am terrified of going into treatment for a lot of reasons but a big one is my fear of not being allowed home, especially now that I’m almost twenty and my mom is not obligated to let me live here. 

I talked to my parents this weekend about what was going on to update them and they were not the most understanding — a lot because I don’t update them, and that was hard. I can’t bring myself to tell them when I feel bad because I don’t want to be kicked out. I know my mom loves me and all that but she has destroyed my trust on so many different occasions and not just in the abandonment issue. And my dad is hard to get along with at times. I’m just terrified that I’m never going to get passed this feeling in my life. And I’m tired of all of it. I’m tired of feeling so low. I’m tired of my eating disorder and the self hating thoughts I have. I’m tired of my paranoia related to my PTSD and the horrible nightmares I have. I hate that everyone who has ever hurt me has gotten away with it. I hate that I can’t control my life and I’m losing myself. I just feel like I’m a burden to everyone in my life, which is not a lot of people. ",07Jan2019,1
130,Wish i could sleep permanently. My future prospects are looking better than ever but I just couldn’t care less right now. I’m in a very weird state of mind.,07Jan2019,1
131,"For about two years now I have started to feel less happy and sad, as of now I can't even remember the last time I was happy. I am constantly feeling something that is hard to explain, the best way to explain it is that I'm feeling neutral. I don't feel happy when anything good happens and I don't feel sad when anything bad happens. When someone says something that would usually make someone really upset I am only feeling a hint of sadness.

I feel as if I can get on with life but I can't be bothered to do much which I know will affect my future but I just can't seem to care, I havent felt suicidal or anything, I have tried cutting last year but stopped after about a week and haven't done it again.

I don't feel excited for anything anymore, whenever I have something to look forward to I don't and cant be bothered even going. I have loads of things to look forward to that range from concerts to  holiday to Florida, but I can't bring myself to be excited or even care. I don't feel stressed, I done my GCSE's last year and know how important they are but I just didn't feel any amount of stress and couldn't be bothered doing them. 

I barely feel any empathy but it will only be for certain people, for example I dont feel empathy for friends and family or peers, this has brought me to situations where I have said or do me things I shouldn't of. 

I don't know what to do, is this a sign for a mental illness or is it normal for your teen years?",07Jan2019,1
132,"TL;DR We began a relationship in August despite both of us knowing the timing was incredibly off. I finally had enough in December and ended it, however we have pretty much remained in constant contact because he’s convinced that it will work in the future and doesn’t want to lose me as a “friend”.

He started pursuing me in July, we had been friends for about six months prior, the entire time of that he was with his long term (8 years) girlfriend who was also pregnant with their second child, so I did not view him as more than a friend. In July I continuously told him the timing was terrible, that she would most likely want to work it out with him once the baby was born, that he was just lonely, etc etc. I KNEW the red flags were there so I am aware I’ve enabled a lot of the behavior. However, when he and I were just friends, I truly truly believed he was one of the most trustworthy and nicest people I’ve met, that’s why I felt like after awhile, it was safe to move forward. Again, this is after weeks of him being persistent. 

A little background: he’s INCREDIBLY charming, outgoing, everyone is drawn to his personality, and he gets along with everyone. Everyone likes him, literally. We worked together so I saw this from my first day. I on the other hand am very much an introvert, reserved, and have walls up with most people. I’m not easily trusting but for some reason I trusted him. He and I worked alone together on Sundays so we shared a lot about our lives, childhood, etc and I believe that helped bring my walls down with him. When we started dating I kept thinking “why is someone like him interested in ME” and told my sister that as well. One thing I noticed is he did lack empathy towards people who he did not know or did not really care about, he would make comments about suicide and mental health as if they were not actual things that existed and if people committed suicide they were in the wrong but that it wasn’t his problem. We worked at a hospital so anytime the topic of death would come up he would say “everyone has to die someday” in a nonchalant joking manner. Both of these rubbed me the wrong way as I myself have struggled with depression and anxiety half my life (never felt comfortable telling him that).

Anyway- his baby was born in September and from that point forward I pretty much have felt like he is lying to me about his children’s mother. I believe they got back together but that he continued to string me along with his lies for months because he didn’t want to lose the physical aspects of the relationship (my assumption). Or he’s not truly happy but doesn’t want to leave for whatever reason, in which case he should still do the right thing and handle it like a grown up. 

For some reason I continued to believe him because of how much I trusted him as my friend. 

Fast forward until now- we haven’t been together for a month but remain in contact. We haven’t spoken in three days because I called him out on lying to me and he didn’t respond so I’ve had time to really think about why he might be a sociopath. 

1. He continues to tell me that he just can’t seem to get his timing right but that he “knows what he wants” and that it’s me. He basically puts this seemingly (false) hope in my heart that at some point in the future it will work for us to be together. He says that in the meantime our foundation is our relationship and we can continue to build on it. 
2. He plays dumb a lot and I believe it’s to manipulate the situation. He wanted to see me Friday and I originally said no but then had a change of heart, and when I did he didn’t respond but later told me that he didn’t know I texted him, that his daughter deleted all his messages, but that he would have loved to see me.
3. He always controls the situation. I’ve told him this. That if we see each other it only happens because he makes the time. He always blames it on his children. 
4. His actions never align with his words. He talks a lot of bullshit to keep me hanging on, but never follows through on 95% of it. 
5. When I try to be entirely done with the situation, he freaks out, guilt trips me and tells me how he’s just doing his best and that he knows it’s hard but that he never wanted to fully give up on each other. And always says he doesn’t want to lose me as a friend.
6. He’s very persistent- if I say no he will press any issue until I say yes. The only thing he didn’t was sex because I was a virgin, but did end up losing it to him (consensually). 
7. He says he respects me, cherishes our friendship, doesn’t play games, has been honest from the start- but again, none of this aligns with his actions.
8. He’s emotionally unavailable and will not talk or open up about a lot of things. He says he’d rather just give it to God and not talk about it anymore. This hurts my heart in the sense I want to help people and I do believe he is hurting but masks it with his overly optimistic outlook/facade.
9. Excuses, excuses, excuses. There’s always something in the way of us seeing each other. Illness, children’s doctors appointment, sitter falling through, everything.

All in all, I just feel very manipulated and led on. I ask him if he really thinks I am stupid and he says I’m one of the most intelligent people he’s ever met. The more I read about narcissism and sociopathy the more I feel like he is on that spectrum. He has this “hold” on me that I can’t seem to shake and move on from.

136,"Hey, guys.

I live in the state of Georgia in the US. Up until recently, I was a college student. Because of my mental health, I didn't do well enough last term to continue receiving financial aid, so I'm having to drop my classes this term.

I need to be able to prove to the school that I have mental health problems and that they're being worked on. I can't do that without a counselor, and am having a hard time finding one that won't take 1/6-1/3 of my paycheck if not more. I believe the problem to be ADHD. I am (obviously?) uninsured, since my state only provides Medicaid if you're pregnant, old, or disabled (or already have children). I am none of those things and barely have pennies to my name right now. I am fortunate to live in a city with bus service. The places I've called have either not answered, don't have services for ADHD, have a two-month waiting list, or want me to be on the other side of town (an hour-long ordeal on buses) at 8 in the morning (most buses don't start until after 6AM) to MAYBE secure a spot.

137,"Hi,

So I’m writing this post in hopes that I could get some clue to my sisters mental health problems. So my sister comes into my room asking if anyone has ever told me about masturbation..because when she discovered it it was scary. From all of our knowledge, she doesn’t masturbate and has never had sex, even after being married. I’m wondering wether her masturbating would relieve her depression. She’s severely depressed and is obsessed with a guy who is 6 years younger than her and has no interests in her. She sends him disturbing emails and he knows not to reply because she’s crazy.  So I was thinking maybe most of her problems would be solve if she just masturbated? Is that wrong to think? And how do you convince such a person to start?

I honestly and truthfully feel like ending my life. I’ve been struggling with this feeling for several months. The only person that’s ever actually cared told me today that she doesn’t want anything to do with me and that if I kill myself I kill myself. Like it doesn’t even matter. Over the past few months I’ve been noticing that I don’t enjoy anything, not just my hobbies and interests, anything. Even food. Everything tastes the same. I hate playing guitar, riding my Harley, driving in general, I hate talking to anyone about anything, I hate the sound of someone else’s voice. I hate just about everything. But these are all things I used to love doing - I don’t want to do anything. And I don’t enjoy ANYTHING. Everything is so bland and lackluster. I can literally lay my head down and go to sleep and sleep for days and days and never get up. I have ruined every good thing I’ve ever had because of these feelings. They will wax and wane but have been present constantly since before Halloween and I feel like I’m drowning.

However, the British Army does not allow anybody with psychosis to be enrolled.

So this year started amazing i had an amazing summer and was in a relationship and was pretty much the happinest i had been ever i practically felt bliss and euphoria on every day for up to two months and this continued a few weeks school started when suddenly i got a lot of work and pressure from school making me stress out i couldn't work because my thought would be racing and i could bearly comprihend them giving me a massive headache this happened almost daily and is where my self harm tendencies started with me using pins to self harm and banging my head against the wall and while this was all happening my girlfriend broke up with me which made me even more depresed and made everything even worse and my turrets had come back something that i hadn't have to deal with since 3rd grad (im in 10th grade) and and after a while this became to much and i started cutting but luckily this only lasted for a week then i went back to normal excluding my turrets but some weeks later i found out my grandpa died which is when shit really hit the fan i started cutting every single day and planning to kill my self and no matter where i went i could stop thinking of ways to comit suecide and when i looked at a building i just thought if it was tall enough to jump off of to kill myself this drove me to make a plan and try to execute it and on that Saturday i went out to a parking lot that i thought i could jump off of to kill myself but for some reason when i got there i didn't feel depressed anymore i fealt Normal almost happy so i went home and i was extremely angry at myself so i cut die into my leg and cried myself to sleap and after that day all of my tics stoped and i was fine for about a week and for the next few weeks i was for the most part normal other tan that i would become depressed and unbearably sad some days and cut myself but this only happend like every other week. But now after the Christmas break im back in to the depssive suecidal loop where everything feels meaningless and i want to die. I have had strong urges to cut myself again (especially today) and im afraid im going to try to kill myself again and the worst part is that no one knows about my self harm depression or anything i wrote about in this post except for the turrets bit and i have no one to turn to because i am afraid that if i tell someone everything will change as my parents and probably the school would probably find out about the suecide and self harm stuff out of no where. And i know some people will tell me to seek professional help and i already am in contact with a psychologist because of my turrets and also because they think i have adhd and i am still waiting for the diagnosis but im afraid to tell them about the depresive episodes self harm and suecide because as i said no one knows anything about this and think im fine and happy as im still very social and seem happy but on the inside im hurting.

It takes me longer to understand things, and providing logical arguments can sometimes be impossible especially because I couldn't fully understand what I've read, to begin with.

I have had some increased stress because of my lack of job security (i.e. had two mediocre performance reviews, in the dark about whether the project is going to be given more funding, etc.), life situation (i.e. having to stay with my brother and parents because I might need them to fall back on if the company goes under), etc. I've also been consuming thc edibles pretty much daily for the past couple of years. Not a whole lot (5 - 10 mg), but im wondering if this goes deeper because I've found that when I begin to lose arguments ESPECIALLY because I couldn't understand it initially I have very strong urges to self harm (rip out my hair, cut myself, punch myself, etc.) I've only ever gone so far as hitting myself out of pure rage or smashing a keyboard, but I'd never cut myself or rip my hair out. This seems to be triggered when people make a comment about something I am insecure about (job, intelligence, etc)

Thing is that it seems that my comprehension and logical thinking is getting worse as time goes on. I have brain fog every day, stress headaches, etc. The only time this went away was when I was home for a week for Christmas--i actually felt normal again.

146,"Hi everyone, I'm not sure this is the right subreddit for this kind of thing, but I could definitely use some help. 

Some background: I had a really good friend in high school, lets say her name is Ilene. We lived in a very white and conservative town and became good friends because both of our parents immigrated to the US, and we didn't really fit in with everyone else. I ended up going to college in the Bay Area in 2010, and she stayed in our town and went to the local Uni there. Over time, we kind of lost contact. She made new friends and so did I. 

Fast forward to 2014. I graduated from college and am still living and working in the bay area.  I haven't talked to Ilene in a couple of years, but she messages me on facebook asking for money. She said she was in a really tight spot and needed it to get an emergency abortion. Even though we hadn't talked in a long time, I still considered her a good friend and sent her the money. She said she would pay me back in a couple of weeks but after that she went completely dark. I didn't hear from her again until a month or so ago. She messaged me and our other friend from high school on facebook saying she missed us and that we should all ""take a trip to cancun"" this year. I'm always down for trips with friends, but it just seemed really out of the blue and weird considering our last interaction..

Yesterday I get some calls from a random number, I didnt pick up but saw that i got a voicemail. It was from Ilene, and she said that she missed me and she saw pictures of me and my partner on facebook. She said my partner was beautiful and she wanted to get to know her. She then sent me this facebook message:

 ""I was molested by my mom. I called the police and they escorted me out of the house because she would not let me leave. She’s painting me as schizophrenic because I called child protective services on her in 2014 for the baby. After she told the baby that I’m sick I knew it was time to leave. I’m staying in an Airbnb and flying to Seattle I’m the 11th. No one knows that I’m leaving. It’s going to have to be for good because she is really hurting me. It’s bad. I can’t succeed and be near her so I’m going to pull a Wilson. Do you know anyone in Seattle? I need to build a network.""

The thing with Ilene is her mom has always been really strict, but she never said anything about any kind of abuse when we were in high school. I know that doesn't mean anything and abusers can manipulate their victims and come in all different forms. But she has 2 sisters close in age and 1 sister that was born when we went to college. I'm friends with her other sisters on social media, and they have always posted snapchats and stories with their younger sister the past few years. 

I asked her if she was ok now, and if she had a chance to talk to her sisters or other family members about her mom. She replied with: 

""It’s not safe to talk to them. (sister 1) dragged me back into the abuse and intentional or not she is my ruin. (sister 2) is employed to trick me and then I end up in trouble. I left my dad’s house in Dallas for much of the same. I’m reaching out and finding people to help me. If you can let me know.""

The thing is, i know her sisters are some of the nicest people i know. I seems really unlikely that they are all in on some plot to abuse Ilene...

I reached out to one sister on Facebook, she saw my message but has not responded yet. I'm really worried about Ilene. I really don't know what she has been up to since really 2012, she has been pretty absent on social media, and the only thing I see are snap chats or instagram posts of her sisters. It seems like she might be having a episode of some kind that is making her paranoid about her family.

How can I help her? I don't want to enable her delusions if she is indeed in some kind of mental health episode, but I also don't want to turn a blind eye if what she is saying is true. 

&amp;#x200B;

147,"hi everyone, 1st post on this subreddit so..nice to meet all of you!! anyway, this is gonna be a bit of a vent so sorry for the long read haha.
well i guess ill start where it began. as a child i was happy happy happy, n all that other kiddy stuff. however as i hit 11, my dad became abusive/emotinally abusive towards me, not sure why to this day. anyway that caused me to be depressed and anxious since 11. also (foreshadowing here), its the perfect set up for BPD.

anyway fstforward to 2016. ive finally realised how i feel isnt right. i had sever suicidal thoights at 13, plotted to kill my dad several times over (yeah oof, pretty messed up)..it all pointed in a bad direction. so i went to the GP, was eventually given CBT n fluoxetine (40mg dose). the fluoxetine helped for a bit but slowly got worse again. my anxiety came back worse than ever in april of last year. it was so bad it ended my relationship at the time, and that was very very important to me. anyway, that was a big hit and made my depression return badly. 
(im skimming over many other events and details here purely because my memory from meds/drug and alcohol abuse/depression is screwed si i cant remember much at all).

so we skip to july 2018...im put on sertraline, 100mg initially and eventuallly upped to 200mg. pretty much a rinse and repeat of fluoxetine, except by the end of sertraline (about november 2018), i was self harming nightly, doing drugs as much as i could to try and feel 'normal', i was binge drinking..u get the deal (im a uni student so can easily access the bad substances etc). like the SSRIs never, ever work..they always stop working for me.

right so after that i decuded to stop sertraline cold turkey. ngl, first few weeks was awful, but afterwards i felt so much better, to the point i was so happy and confident  and feeling like my actual self that my ex and i became good friends! (using that as a point to show i felt so much better). this feeling continued for 1.5 months or so, id managed to adopt a new mindset and a new way of living - it was amazing!!!

but disaster strikes: i had to go home for christmas holidays. whilst at home i really struggled to keep my new positive self (not sure why), and i crashed really bad. intense depression and anxiety returns. i start worrying about my ex/close friend outta no where and ruin that friendship. ruin another friendship with arguably my closest friend as i was freaking out over a bunch of things and baso cut her out my life (yeah, im a dick). 

now we cut to today. im back at uni again, still feel pretty bad, except its different again. here i feel emotionally dead, dont care about anythng (eg anxiety is like very low rn), yet i feel awful and i dont know why. i feel like theres so much going wrong..but its really really not. i remember my GP saying i have a very strong 'distress intolerance' - still not exactly sure what this is. i keep on relapsing for no apparent reason..even my own coping mechanisms from a couple months ago do nothing. i really dont undersrand whats going on, why i feel how i do, or if theres even a reason for all this?? i know this is a lot and ive skimmed over way too much stuff abiut my life for this to be useful to anyone but...can anyone please help? thank you",07Jan2019,1

I was just scrolling through my youtube feed, listening to music, then I pass by recommandations from youtube of this channel that I've been following for years, Nomad Colossus. I KNOW for a fact that I have watched all of his videos across the years and I've always followed his findings closely as I was really intrigued with this video game.

What caught my attention was the fact that seeing the name of the game, Shadow of the Colossus, seemed really out of place for me. I had literally been watching more of Nomad's videos on the game just a few weeks ago, but for some reason this time I **strongly** felt like I did not remember the game being called ""Shadow"" of the Colossus. I remembered it as *something* of the Colossus, but not the word Shadow.

Moreover I did not recognise the thumbnails or titles of the videos, even though as I've said before, I know for a fact I have watched all his videos throughout the years. [And as you can see they're not exactly new videos either.](https://gyazo.com/a0554f46388cbdf168a521f3a09bfe55) These videos are also the types that would really intrigue me to watch and I know I would've never passed the opportunity to watch them after seeing the titles. I don't remember animals in the game other than the lizards and birds, I have no idea what's in the thumbnail for the video about animals as it freaked me out too much to watch it yet.  I would have always loved to see the lost music track, more beta colossi and the pool scene. I would have never *not* wanted to watch these videos!

And regarding to the name of the game, I starting feeling like I was going mad because I felt like I knew for *sure* that Shadow of the Colossus was not the name. I remember the game being called ""SotC"" for some reason though and that's the only thing that doesn't feel unnatural to remember.

I even felt the need to go back through my discord server and search to see if I had really said ""shadow of the colossus"", and to my surprise [on 6th of February 2017 I indeed called the game Shadow of the Colossus](https://gyazo.com/1b170dd949e874a048dc0806e7ecdbf6).

I feel like I should also mention, as it might be relevant, that I've had deja vu feelings way more than any of my peers. I only found out the deja vu feelings weren't normal when I was a kid and no one around me had them to the frequency that I did when I talked about it. Lately though, especially in the past 3ish years, they've become extremely frequent, with several cases at minimum of 5 times a month, sometimes several in a span of a few days. Doctors don't believe it's cause for concern but it's starting to get tiring and annoying. They're small things most of the time like feeling as I've seen things on the internet before, heard of new tv show plot a few years back before they were filmed etc.

&amp;#x200B;

No matter how many times I repeat the name Shadow of the Colossus in my head it still feels unnatural and I'm still at loss as to why I feel this way and why I don't remember seeing Nomad's videos... It doesn't help that I've recently changed computers and youtube did not keep track of my history to show me with the red line underneath the thumbnail that I had watched it, as it usually does.

I don't know if these are even symptoms or hints to another serious mental health problem, as google dismisses deja vu as innocent and I have not yet found anything certain about this sort of... *amnesia* I suppose I could call it.

It feels really disheartening, especially when this game has been my all time favorite for several years and I have always been very deep into findings about its lost content or secrets, and Nomad's videos especially.",07Jan2019,1
149,"I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety ever since middle school (now a 22 year old female). I was never diagnosed with anything because I never was able to seek treatment. I think I have social anxiety, depression, and OCD. Since around 8th grade I’ve dealt with anxiety around people I’m not comfortable with just yet, and it takes me a while to be comfortable. It makes me sick to be the center of attention and I would never be the one to speak up or raise my hand in class and I hated group projects. I had 1 friend that I would be around all day because it seemed like I wasn’t capable of forming connections with others and I never knew how to hold conversations without becoming anxious. It was almost like my mind would shut off and I couldn’t think of anything to say. Now that I’ve been out of school for a while, I still don’t really have friends. I moved states over 3 years ago and have yet to make friends. I have a boyfriend and I spend a lot of time with my sister (we’re best friends). I’ve tried to make friends, but I overthink it. I’ll get the courage to ask to hang out and if they don’t express interest on their own to do something I’ll think that they don’t want to be friends. I hate parties and will constantly worry that people are thinking I’m weird for being shy and quiet. I’ve had depression since around the same time as the social anxiety. I find it hard not to want to do anything but lay in bed and feel down a lot of the time. I would never commit suicide, but I have had thoughts that it would be so much easier if I didn’t have to be here. As for the OCD, I think I developed it within the last 6 months or so, or maybe it’s always been there but just got worse. I have wild thoughts that everyone I care about will die, specifically in a car accident. Anytime my sister or boyfriend leaves I’m worried they won’t make it home. I have an intense fear of driving and firmly believe that I will die in an accident, so I have compulsions in the car as well. I was in a car accident this past summer so that must have triggered that intense fear. I have 2 dogs and think that when they’re in their kennel when I’m not home that they’ll get out and get into something and get hurt. I have to take pictures of the locks on their kennels and I’ll think to myself that if I don’t, they will get out and something bad will happen. I’m terrified that someone will break in at night so I go back and forth checking the locks multiple times and taking pictures. I‘have to wake up early for work every morning, so I check my alarms over and over, probably 30 times, until I fall asleep. I think that if I don’t I’ll miss work and get fired. These are just a few of the things when it comes to the obsessive thinking. Constantly worrying and overthinking is mentally exhausting me, and I don’t have access to seek therapy. I don’t know how much longer I can deal with this. Some advice would be greatly appreciated.",07Jan2019,1
150,"Hey everyone, just curious what symptoms you all experience with anxiety and or other illnesses. I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and while I don't experience panic attacks, I do live with anxiety everyday. As a result I usually am always concerned of my own physical health and would like some assurance my symptoms are normal for someone like me ",07Jan2019,1
