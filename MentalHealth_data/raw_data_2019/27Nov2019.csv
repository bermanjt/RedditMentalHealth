0,"I recently distanced from myself from a man (also 25) who was very emotionally abusive/manipulative. I wake up everyday and I miss him. I feel like there is no life left within me. I am so close to getting into nursing school and I'm ready to throw everything away. Even basics like showering is incredibly difficult for me. I am usually a really happy person, but at this point, I'm ready to give up. I had no idea that pain could cut this deep. I've tried going to free counselling at school when I can. At the same time, I'm scared to try a new counselor that I could see on a more regular basis. I see my future in front of me and it looks bright (if I can get through this). Part of me wants to self destruct so badly and I don't know what to do. I wish I could disappear.   


TL;DR I'm really sad and ready to give up on everything.",27Nov2019,1
1,"Hi guys. Recently I lost two people in my immediate family and a parent was diagnosed with terminal cancer. I quit my job because I wasn't capable of keeping my shit together for more than an hour at a time. I thought I'd take a few months to recuperate and then start applying for jobs again, but then my parent was diagnosed and started chemo and now needs care. 

In short, I cannot work so I cannot afford therapy. I applied for medicaid but was denied because I didn't submit the followup paperwork necessary. I have no excuse for this other than I was already handling a lot and I didn't check my business email to realize there were followup interviews, etc., until it was too late.

The only online resources I've found have been largely some form of chat-based conversation with a non-therapist. I've tried this but often times the other person seems incapable of unpacking the vast amount of shit that's wrong with me. 

I've been having more suicidal thoughts than what's normal for me and I know I need to do something before I get stupid, but I'm not sure where to turn or what to do.

I hope this wasn't too long. Thank you for reading!",27Nov2019,1
2,"My life has been getting worse over the past 6 months.

My friends don't seem to want to hang out with me anymore and I think they've been manipulating me for years. My grades have dropped because I don't care about the subjects I do. Nothing I used to do is fun for me anymore and I spend most of my time watching YouTube videos I don't really care about. I've started having negative thoughts and even daydreamed about committing a murder-suicide, though I don't think I'd ever do something like that. This feels like the end of my life and I don't look forward to the future.

I don't know if anyone can help me but it felt good to put this out here.",27Nov2019,1

Cause I didn't know that they were the only thing helping me navigate the world. Cause when they disappeared I had no one who cared. The people who should have been caring about me just kept doing what they always did abuse me. Feed me lies about myself and treat me like shit. That I can't do anything right. Treat me like a second class citizen. I had to stop taking the meds cause I wasn't allowed to get help and have a place to live.

7,"I'll provide a synopsis for you all.

Things started to become more severe in the past 3 months. I noticed a subtle decline though for about 1 and 1/2 years though.

Let's go back 2 years. I just graduated college with a bachelor's degree in sociology. I was afraid I wouldn't get a job with two Misdemeanors. Well, I was wrong.

I started a job as a Drug and Alcohol counselor last July (1 1/2 years ago). I was also accepted into a Master's program for Social Work around the same time. Exciting right? Good full time job and part time grad school as a commuter.

I have my own apartment, and it's nice because it's a house. I have isolated myself from friends and family in order to be completely dedicated to work and study. This has allowed me to succeed for some time. Now, things are slipping.

Currently doing an internship as part of grad school along with work is driving me down. I cannot get things done on time and have been reprimanded for being late on reports as well as timeliness to work. My grades are in good standing, thank god! But with finals approaching and work crushing me, I have been unable to move.

I tend to lay in bed, incapable of moving. Feel like giving up and things are hopeless, worthless even. I can't get anything done it seems. People depend on me and it hurts not to deliver. I feel like I could be depressed, but will not admit to it.

How do I get out of this rut? Have any of you had similar experiences? What inspired you? Who did you reach out to? Thanks in advance if you read the whole way through.",27Nov2019,1
8,"Thank god the shithole known as the 2010s is about to be over. This will go down as the worst decade in human history. Also as the worst years of my life for me personally. Overall, the 2010s were a major development but in a highly negative way. Here’s my personal review of how the 2010s went for me. 

&gt;2010
Awesome year. Still had the late 00s vibe to it. 

&gt;2011 - 2015
Worst years of my life. 

&gt;2016 - May 2018
A break from all the bs. Things seemingly were starting to get better around this time.
 
&gt;June 2018 - December 2018
Anxiety and hypochondria like you wouldn’t believe was possible. 

&gt;January 2019 - February 2019
Year starts off pretty promising. 

&gt;March 6th, 2019 - November 24th, 2019
Fucking trainwreck. 

&gt;November 25th - present
Promising way to end off such a shit year. I’ll have to see how this one goes.

How were the 2010s for you? For me, it was a time of suffering. It was the worst chapter of my life by far starting in January 2011 when my mom announced her pregnancy to a third kid with a guy she had been dating on and off for about a year or so and who I really didn’t like, especially when compared to the man she was already dating at the time who was a gym coach at my school and who I really liked. Then later on that year I entered the 7th grade and that was when the bullying started and when my entire house of cards came tumbling over. Things would continue to get worse until 2016 when I had a little break from all of it because I had something to distract me from all of my personal problems (in this case, politics). Also in 2016, I graduated with a GED after I dropped out of high school after failing the 9th grade twice because my mother was taking all of my adderall and vyvanse so I couldn’t stay awake in class and because I had to get up so early for the bus to go to a school that was out of town because I got bullied out of that last one that was more nearby. During this period (2011 - 2015), I was committed involuntarily three times. Also in 2015, I got put on disability, but my mother got it put into her name so I receive none of it as it’s in her bank account. She has threatened me on at least two occasions over it, such as that one time when she was yelling at me over being near the phone asking me if I was gonna call social security and the second time was when she was pestering me after I stole the card to go online to pay for an account on some ancestry website telling me that she could look to see if I made any transactions. I tried moving out of this shithole on and off for four years now, with the first time being when I was committed sometime back in 2015. But I didn’t start breaking my balls looking for ways out of here while trying everything at my disposal until sometime earlier on this year (like in March or so). This year has been the worst year for me since 2015, and my behavior started to dramatically change. I got committed twice this year: the first time voluntarily and the second time involuntarily for two weeks due to family problems. It got to the point to where I was calling the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline nearly everyday for months on end. I was screaming until my throat got sore to seemingly no avail. There was a whole bunch of shit bothering me this year, but most of it I’ve adapted to at this point (such as certain noises). However, as of Nov. 25th (yesterday), I received good news over the phone from my new counselor that I could petition the court to get my disability money either in my name or somebody elses. I just have to wait until Dec. 2nd to see my new counselor, since my last one was a dumbass.",27Nov2019,1
9,"So in May I smelled a sweet smell that I knew wasn't there. Afterwords, it caused a severe obsession about the idea that I am developing schizophrenia or a brain tumor. I'd have to record things with my phone to make sure I wasn't hallucinating. I would go over every thought to make sure it didn't sound delusional. These symptoms eventually developed into mood swings (or emotional dysregulation, I am not sure) where the littlest things can cause a severe mood swing (my moods rarely last more than a few hours). Sometimes my mood feels like extremely anxiety (I believe it may be paranoia) as well as feelings of decreased emotions. I've also been having awful intrusive thoughts (although I've had them most of my life).

Occasionally, it's hard to tell if a thought actually happened. For example, one time I had a thought about maniacally laughing in my car. It took me ten seconds to realize it never happened (my reasoning was if it did, my mother would have said something). 

Sometimes a mood I go into involves I started dissociating really badly. Lately, I also can get mad extremely easily. My mother called me ""shizo"" earlier because I pissed her off (not hard to do). I got super mad and had a strong desire to start screaming at her in the store we were in. I also had a strong feeling about pushing a random person down.

After I cooled off (about a minute or two later) I felt extremely horrible. I felt like a monster, like the worst person on the entire planet, and I feel like I should be punished. I've been crying at the thought.",27Nov2019,1
11,"There's this thing called Abraham Maslow's ""Hierarchy of Needs"" and it looks like [this.](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow-hierachy-of-needs-min.jpg) Basically, if one of your needs on the pyramid is not met, all of the other ones suffer. For example, if you lack ""love and belonging"", you will also lack the needs above that on the pyramid.

I think I'm in a pretty good spot overall in life as all of my needs are met, **except for** self-actualization, and all I have to say is, my mental state is suffering badly. I suffer from major depressive disorder, social anxiety disorder and GAD. **With** self-actualization, these illnesses are a lot easier to cope with. But since I lack self-actualization, my mental illness eats me alive every day and I could just use some advice/support if anything.

Lacking self-actualization is so bad that I cannot even begin to imagine what life is like for those that lack even more, so much so that I feel like ""self-actualization"" should be at the **bottom of the pyramid.** But obviously that's just not how it works. There was a point in my life where I felt like I used to have self-actualization, where my mental illnesses weren't so harsh on me. But one day I woke up and everything just changed in the blink of an eye and it's been about three years now that I've been living like this.

So, in short, does anybody have any advice as to how I can achieve self-actualization? I've been trying to figure it out for years to no avail. Any help is appreciated.",27Nov2019,1
12,"Hi, I am 18 years old male from North Macedonia. I feel unable to cry. I have been like this for around 5 years. As a kid I was often made fun for crying in school, I might have pressed it down deep enough that now I can't do it. I feel as if there isn't something sad enough for me to cry for. Family members passing, relationships ending(both romantic and friendships), nothing makes me cry. I have had an existential view of the world my whole life. I just feel unable to connect to others in a meaningful way.

13,"So today was a lot better than all of the others.   
So recently, from the past months, I have been dealing with more then usual, this has taken a massive toll on my mental health. More harassment at school, more issues at home, and the list will go on, too much to write down. At that time, I just put it all in a bottle, never said anything, until today. But the reason I did not say anything in the past is that when I did, I was always put down or talked down too for speaking up. They called me ""attention-seeking,"" so this lead to me losing productivity and interest in everything. Well, one of my friends noticed this, and he let me talk to him for a bit of time, and he listened and cared, unlike others in the past who just used my trust to get others to hate me.

17,"I have roommates who live with me at our apartment. I have grown to be obsessed about one of them because I started to find them attractive, but I knowthey aren't attracted to me. I have never been able to get over them, got better but still trying,so there are times where I get obsessed about what they could be doing all the time, and even about things like what are they like when having sex. i can't stop feeling obsessed about these things.

So last week ago I did something I never would normally wanted to do. I dug throug their garbage (only because they shaved one day and dumped the hairs in their garbage and not the sink, i saw them), and I was sooo obsesed about if they shaved just their face or more... I stayed home alone later, and as I past their room, something came over me and made me want to investigate the garbage, just to see what the hairs was like. It is so disgusting for me to think about it as I type.

But what I found was so much more then expected. They had a friend  stay over the night previous. I ended up finding some paper towels in the garbage that wrapped their cum becuase they had sex the night before (next door room can be heard). I actually couldn't believe what I found. i already felt SOO bad digging through their garbage, invading their personal life and space. But when I found this, I could not resist at all. It is so fuckin nasty and stupid, but I explored those tissues, opnened them up to see what it was like and even smelled it. I started getting aroused and excitedfrom this and I put things back and ended up masterbating to this whole thing.

I felt SOO awful and guilty and regretful right after for what I did. I defiled their private things, and am such a creep, pervert, gross person that I even did this! I feel like I can't live with myself knowing I did something so bad. It has been bothering me so badly this past days.

What was worse was the next day a few days ago, I was home by myself for a little, and decided to throw away my trash before going out. We have a big bin of trash in the kitchen and I ended up finding that same garbage bag in the bin. I seriously could not control myself, and I once again dug through the remains of the older garbage to find those tissues again. As if I wanted more evidence or to experience the sixk thrill I got again. i got aroused from going through the garbage and those tissues again but I left it at that, threw my own garbage bag away and tried to move on.

I super regret doing this and feel so guity and so gross that I even did this. I want to talk to my therapist about this wich will surprise them but they are out for the holidays. I felt like I needed to vent this out. I am so messed up. I literally have no control on these actions and i ended up making me a horrible nasty gross person. I am trying to admit to myself that I did thise things but a part of me  thinks that it was fine and that it doesn't matter, so I feel so disconnected from the what I did. It has been hard to talk to my friends in the home without thinking about this and act normal. At least some are gone for the holidays.I don't deserve to be happy about anything now, I feel like I just ruined their live without them even knowing it! How do I even try to live past this? I know there could be way worse things done whic at least I don't do worse things. But this is so horrible and sickening disgusting. How horrible can I be? I want to not do this EVER again but what if I do? What's wrong with me!",27Nov2019,1

That said, I would like to ask you guys, who I'm sure have signifigantly more expertise than myself on the topic of mental health, a very serious question that I'm unable to answer from my searches on the internet.

I'm currently 17yrs old, male, in highschool, and have had consistent and non stop urges to kill people around me, and myself, since elementary school. I've never been capable of taking to my parents, or friends/other family about these urges, out a fear. These urges have become so horrifically unbearable that I've recently been diagnosed with chronic insomnia, as I can never stop thinking about these evil fantasies. These feelings are all tied in some way to my sex interests, and are all aimed a girl's my age. I have dreams about doing horrible things to these girls. I'm not a shy person, I'm very sociable, do well in school, have great friends, play sports, and will be going to college next year. I've been recently watching interviews of jeffery dahmer and Ted bundy, and see significant similarities between my youth and theirs'.

No ones brain can ever truly stop.....but I feel like my mind constantly moves at light speed. Northern lights are constantly swimming through my mind. Sometimes it’s overwhelming, mainly because I’m almost always thinking about things that are out of my circle of control. I think about deep things like our society and how I’m not happy with the world. I think about how most of the people on this planet are so shitty. How the world is mainly made from greed and money and that everyone including me is going to have to work until they die not because they want to but because living is not free. I think about so many different things. Sometimes I get overwhelmed because I wish I could change things. I wish I could change the world. I wish everyone could just be about peace and love. I wish everyone cared about the earth and nature and taking care of themselves but most importantly others.

27,"Hi guys and gals,

My wonderful Wife has written, self published and illustrated her own book called 'Rupert's Black Dog'. It's basically about helping your children to understand the pressures of dealing with anxiety and depression and encouraging conversations around normalizing and managing anxiety and depression. 

Her goal is to get this out to Mental health organizations and businesses alike that can help spread the word and make this a resource for the world over.

If you or anyone you know can help make this happen or have some contacts in these sectors then your help would be very much welcomed and appreciated. Your help in getting this out into the world would be the chance to save a child/adult from experiencing what so many of us deal with every day of our lives.

Please private message me your details or the details of someone you know who could help with this. Currently her book is marketed in New Zealand but this is a worldwide issue and we hope to spread this around the global and hopefully make a difference. 

The books link is below so you can see what it looks like and understand what its about. 

Thank you very much for your time.

I never felt that I would click so easily talking with another human being. On our second meeting, however (and at this point I've only met with her twice), she got oddly religious on me. She told me that God loves me and accepts me for who I am. 

I am an atheist. 

I have been uncomfortable since then. I don't want religious help, I want actual help. Now, to be fair, so far she really was doing a good job. I really felt comfortable with her. After this though, I dug up her Twitter (really woman, it shouldn't be that easy to find if you work with the public!) and found that we are also on the complete opposite ends of the political spectrum as well.

I feel like I won't be able to trust her after this, but I am unsure if I am overreacting. I almost feel like this is confirming some of my worst fears about getting help- that my therapist will always be secretly judging me.

35,"I remember when I was going through my worst periods of depression where I want able to see a future for myself past the next 3 hours. Like my vision of the future past the week was literally black and I was coasting through life on autopilot. Then life would get rough and I felt like I was hydroplaning through weeks at a time. And I was ok with it because if I crashed it would all be over.  I lost months of my life to this sort of autopilot mode I was on and I’m sure some of you have been going through it for longer.


But it’s not always black.


I’ve been going to therapy and I’ve been trying to have an aggressive mentality for getting better. I’m tired of getting kicked around by this ugly monster in my head that tells me that life is better locked in my room and under my covers. I thought of it like when you feel a cold coming on and you tell yourself you aren’t getting sick and then the cold doesn’t hit you as hard, if at all. I’ve been forcing myself to leave the house and hang around friends. Reopening relationships I’ve kicked to the curb has been difficult but I’ve been blessed with good people around me that have been willing to accept me back and I’m starting to pick my life up piece by piece.


What I guess I’m trying to say is that life isn’t always dictated by that monster in your head. He wasn’t always around and he doesn’t always have to stay. Sure he comes back from time to time and I’m ok with that because now I recognize that it’s a temporary feeling. The color in my life is starting to come back. The emotions are slowly coming back. The genuine smiles rather than the fake ones I put on. I see the light at the end of the tunnel for the first time in what feels like a lifetime and I feel my self getting closer. I hope you guys start to see it soon too. This sub has been huge for me going from denying that anything is wrong, to accepting that I am depressed, to seeking help, to recovery and I hope you guys get better soon too.

I am looking for information on natural, lifestyle, our dietary changes I can make that will help me with my dysthymia (chronic but more mild depression) and ADD (or ADHD primarily Inattentive Type). For example, I know that some foods help lift and stabilize mood, while other foods tend to make it crash. There are some supplements that can help. Screen time can impact both depression and ADD. Where can I learn about these things so I can structure my life in a way that's better for my mental health? Is there a book or website that would be a good place to start?

37,"Hi all, 

I’m a 20F college student in the U.S. 
I feel like I’ve always needed therapy but my parents denied it to me when I was younger. I had anxiety when I was younger and I think I was mentally abused (Traditional Asian parents... not sure if it says anything. They don’t think mental health is a real thing)

I feel like I can’t express my emotions or thoughts properly. I don’t know if I’ll ever be truly happy in any of my relationships (currently in a year+ relationship). 

I don’t want to be miserable in all that I do anymore. I want help to be a better person mentally, a better friend, and a better girlfriend to my significant other. I want to be able to not ruin everything when my mental health goes down. I don’t like the way I act towards my s/o and I don’t want our relationship to be toxic anymore because of me. 

I just don’t know where to start. Would it better to see a therapist in person? Is there anything I can start online like a virtual therapist? I am still under my parents insurance, I don’t think cost or them finding out will be an issue. 

I know I have many more problems than the ones listed above. I just want help to be a better person but I don’t know where to start. Thank you.

42,"Hello,

Back in March I inherited a tank with some fish from someone who didn't want to take care of them.  I had been interested in the fish hobby for a while because I wanted a pet that would be ok being alone while I'm at work.  I struggled to get my small tank to cycle  for months and lost the fish I had at the time and this was a bigger tank (125 gallon) that was well established so it would solve that problem for me.  

Well, I thought my mental health had been doing well enough.  I got promoted a year ago and that caused a lot of chaos in my life and I was riding a roller coaster of well-being during that time.  But then I got my sea legs around the time I got the tank so I thought my mental health would be stable.  I'm just not doing well.  I should be doing water changes every week but I'm basically doing them every month.  So I think it's time to give up.  I've had them for eight months.  I don't want them to have poor water quality and slowly die.  

So I'm going to call the fish store tomorrow (not a chain, a real fish store) and see what my options are.  I hope I can give them to the store and give away my tanks (I have a 29g and a 60g not being used) as well.  Seeing them everyday is just reminding me of yet another hobby that didn't go anywhere.

I actually was going to re-commit myself to taking care of the tank a month or two ago and I really was going to do the weekly water changes because I felt I had that enthusiasm and motivation again.  Less than two weeks later one of the fish died.  I selected a slow one, which was my mistake.  It was fine for months but eventually one of the others became opportunistic.  Anyway, I took it really, really hard.  It killed what motivation I did have.

I cried on my way home from work but I really know this is for the best.  This is mostly a vent because I'm too heartbroken to talk about it at work (they know how much I loved them) but I welcome any advice.  For reference, I was in therapy a year and a half ago, before the promotion.  I ended my therapy because I was doing well at the time.  I've considered going back several times since then for a variety of reasons.",27Nov2019,1

45,"22/f. I just feel like I may be slowly going insane. I’m not sure what exactly is wrong with me but I just haven’t felt like myself at all. A little backstory: when I was young, my mom thought I might have sociopathic tendencies because I never felt remorse and was apathetic to situations like upsetting my siblings or being put in timeout. Apparently this got better with age, but I feel like I keep seeing bits of that side of me coming out. 

For some reason I do not get upset when I leave people. I almost feel relieved, but miss them later. Examples: my first boyfriend leaving for college, leaving my best friends multiple times, having my parents visit (I am in the military), friends, and my husband who lives cross country (i live in CA and husband/friends/family in VA and MD)I never feel any emotion even they leave except a little relieved, but then miss them after they are gone. This has become worse lately.

 I have also become extremely introverted when I used to be an extrovert. I don’t want friends and do not seek social interaction, even though I used to be extremely social and always wanting to be with people. I like to be alone now. I find myself very irritable almost 80% of the time. It’s easy for me to come up with negative things to say for any situation. I have become almost completely asexual (I never was a super sexual person but now I’m repulsed by the thought of sex, which is not great since I’m married). I’m tired a lot. I go through phases of insomnia and will impulse spend on anything and sometimes stay up all night doing some weird project. I’m not motivated. I have gained about 25 lbs this year. I just don’t know what’s going on and the scope of help I can seek is slim since I am in the military and could have my job questioned heavily if diagnosed with any mental illness. I just feel like I don’t want to go on continuing down this path. I miss how I used to be and feel like I’m going insane.

I remember that I was the only one that could hear it. My mother said that it was God speaking to me, which only frightened me even more.

52,"Was isolated for the most part from the world except for parents at home who didn’t take much interest in, then around age 11 I became involved in sports which I credit me still being alive to. Early teen years I was very very awkward, people always described me as shy, or quiet which I was but I just had no idea how to communicate with others especially peers my age 

This gradually has improved some over time and I think I can carry myself very well in a formal/business environment (Job interviews for example, I’ve never not gotten a job and good jobs at that) often get told I seem like someone who served in the military (did not) but when it comes to anything past that like small talk a friendly conversation I can talk someone’s ear off if I know you well, but just in general I turn back into that awkward 12 year old who doesn’t even know how to display facial emotion. (Friend commented on this recently lol) and like I don’t mean to come off as uninterested or uninteresting. However I just often don’t know what to say if it’s outside of my job because the life I’ve lived which I’m unbelievably thankful for the things that made me into who I am (some of them anyway) 

My whole life until 18 revolved around a single thing, it raised me it showed me the values of hard work, sacrifice, respect, discipline, and these are what I base my life off of, but that’s also all I base my life off of, so while I’ve always been the hardest worker at work for example that’s also all I’ve ever had, and I don’t talk about it much because young I convinced myself I’d never have a family,meaningful romantic relationship because I decided I would sacrifice that for my goals I’d sacrifice anything. 

Now that thing is gone in life as is normal but I kind of realize now i want more out of life, on the outside I am rather success, went to war with a dark drug addiction and won rebuilt everything killer job but, I’m lonely honestly which is normal I guess to a degree but I haven’t had a romantic relationship since I was like 15, nothing long enough to speak of anyway, which in hindsight is interesting as in school I was fairly popular I think but I just don’t trust anyone and with no real tools to express interest in someone I kind of just shut that part of me off and now I don’t know what to do",27Nov2019,1

56,"Title says it all, I really can’t mentally transition having him as my ex-boyfriend. 

We were in a long distance relationship for almost a year and a half, talking every day through the internet and visiting practically bimonthly. 

I met him on the tail end of my first ever relationship which was incredibly toxic and abusive. I think I only got the strength to break up with my first ex because of him. 

Because I was coming from a place of so much pain, he took advantage of that and love bombed the hell out of me. 

He told me I was the prettiest girl he’d ever met (most guys say I’m a 7/10), really treated me like it to. I blocked him on everything and he wrote me a letter. He spent hundreds of dollars on me that I knew he didn’t have. He complimented me every day, talked to me every day, always took care of me... 

He made me feel beyond special- he was the only person I felt like understood me, loved me, wanted me around. And his family made me feel this way too. 

I always felt like we were connected- even when we were fighting- we were working under the same tendencies and patterns. Something I felt like nobody had like me, nobody was that decent. 

He was my other half. 

I had got to know his whole family and all his siblings (a family of 6) and I was basically like a daughter to his parents. I took care of his younger siblings too and was very involved with his life and the whole family’s lives. 

When we broke up, it didn’t even feel real. He never told me why, but he kept me around for about a month. He said he loved me, he still wanted me around, but he didn’t want me as a girlfriend anymore. I couldn’t take it, I felt so far away from him, it just built into rage. He finally gave up on me. 

I was so enraged that I cursed him out, I said the meanest things I’ve ever said to anyone- “are you crying? I hope you are. I hope you hurt as much as you fucking hurt me. You’re a piece of shit. You’re a monster.” I ended the relationship, and he has my phone number but hasn’t done anything to show that he wants me back, understandably. 

There’s a certain way a guy talks to you when he hurts. It’s just a voice that’s given up, a voice that tells the truth it doesn’t want to, a voice that cares about you but can’t stand you any longer. And I hate to hear it. I want to be with someone who wants me, but I want him. 

He wants nothing to do with me, but to me he’s still my baby. It’s been months and I still think about him with happiness, missing him, loving him. I knew even if I got to talk to him, it wouldn’t be the same, and I’d just be crushed because he doesn’t want me anymore. I accidentally described him as my boyfriend at work the other night, and I immediately felt so disgusting and sad. 

Sometimes it’s easier to just lie and say he is my boyfriend to tell a story. Sometimes it’s easier to think of him as my boyfriend because I don’t have to deal with the mental conflict of reality and my memories. It’s just so hard to feel different when I rarely even saw him or talked to him towards the end, maybe once a week. I used to have to wake up every morning and remember that he isn’t my boyfriend. 
I still have to remind myself but these memories and these feelings won’t go away. I hate it. 

*nsfw trigger warning* 
I can’t even touch myself without thinking about him or wanting him. It’s been several months. I don’t want to be with other people, I don’t want to date, I don’t have crushes, my body doesn’t want other people. It wants him. I’ve been in nonconsensual situations with other people, and my body tenses in a certain way. I can’t enjoy anything sexual because my body won’t let me, and my mind half way doesn’t even want to. My body and mind go off with warning that I am my ex-boyfriend’s still, that I need to save myself for him. He was the only person I’ve ever trusted or enjoyed sexually. I can’t imagine sex with anyone else, not even previous crushes or celebrity crushes or anything. All I want is him. I hate it. 

*nsfw over* 

The relationship is over and will never be the same. I can’t stop loving him, wanting him, thinking about him as my boyfriend. Not even as an ex that I want back, full blown delusional “he is my boyfriend”. What do I do about this? I feel so disgusting. Is this normal?",27Nov2019,1
57,"I went to an IOP/transitional living facility in July, and I lost so much progress due to irresponsible group therapy, family therapy, and facilitators openly picking on me in group. Also, it was a sober living facility in which hardly anyone any intention of staying sober, so I was surrounded by people relapsing or planning thier post discharge parties while trying to surround myself with people who could actually respect my desire to stay sober. It was   like this facility wasn't designed to help you help yourself, it was a test of how much in-group humiliation, pressure to drink, and insitgation from therapists designed to pit us against each other and our families we could handle.

Is this (signs of) depression? PTSD? How do I fix it? Can I? Does anyone else do this?

 Note: I also have very lucid and intense dreams usually unsettling ones that have made it to where I’m scared to fall asleep sometimes, scared to death of the dream my subconscious will come up with and how it might mind break me.

(Everything under this is pretty rambley)

For a bit of more personal information the things that usually come to mind are people I love leaving me (that have actually happened) recently it’s mostly been an ex sometimes I’ll think of an ex childhood friend, sometimes it’s memories from when I was a kid of usually very sad times I don’t even remember that well, and often the future and how it’s not in my control and I might die alone, unloved or unimportant the word. Sometimes it’s just me thinking I’m a shit person that could do better somehow and unintentionally hurt people with my own issues and emotional baggage , like flirting with someone, wanting they’re company without thinking about them actually liking me and how I could hurt them in the long run just like others have hurt me in that way and how shit it felt. How unintentionally cruel I can be to the people I love most.

Another note: I do have childhood trauma and went through a really bad breakup the doctor thinks gave me ptsd (which I might agree with, I did actually have recurring nightmares about it for a month or 2) maybe that has something to do with it? But I remember being like this since 2nd grade) it seems things I have gotten over with time want to sneak up on me.",27Nov2019,1
59,Why do I still care 45 minutes after leaving a parking lot that I accidentally tried to pull my door handle when it was still locked? Why do I wonder how many people saw me do it and what those people think about people who do things like that? What if they have seen me do that before and I'm known to them as 'that stranger who was too dumb to remember that he locked his car door'? Why does it matter so much to me that I wish I could go back in time and do it right? I know it doesn't matter. Why can't I stop caring about it? I don't know how to stop being so fixated on insignificant things that nobody in the world probably even registers happening.,27Nov2019,1

Im not happy thats for sure. I see people have figured so many things out and just achieve what they want and I for some reason feel no matter how much I tru or prepare I never get my desired end goal or result.

What is wrong with me? Am I just self sabotaging?

63,"Some backstory: My little brother is 19 years old and have survived all 19 years without any major injuries. He's always been a happy-go-lucky person and animals have generally liked him. He started walking around our neighborhood recently for exercise (like 3 months ago) and everything has been fine. We'd bid him fair well, he'd walk for about an hour and return home. It even got to a point to where the neighbors started recognizing him. 

Fast-forward to this Monday

My little brother went on his usually walk when all of a sudden a pit bull got out of one of the houses and attacked him. My brother tried to flee, scream and fight until a neighbor THANKFULLY rescued him from being killed by the dog. He unfortunately suffered many injuries resulting in him needing surgery in two different places. The dog nearly missed his throat and caught his face instead. This absolutely broke my heart but i've been trying my best to keep a positive attitude to lift his spirits a bit and only cry at night and it has been working slightly since we tend to lean on each other for support in situations. As time goes on he seems to get more and more sad as he realizes what happened. We've been sure to tell him that it was nothing that he's done and he didn't deserve what happened. We've been incredibly attentive (since he can't walk atm and is on crutches) and have been doing everything in our power to let him know we're so happy he's here with us. We desperately don't want this to effect him in the long term but I just wanted to know if you guys have any other ideas to help him.

64,"Hi, so, I'm a 19-years old trans girl from Poland. There's currently a lot on my head - I study architecture, which is very time and energy consuming, I work part-time and go through gender dysphoria diagnosis at the same time. I work to finance my transition - it's very costly, with no help from the national health services here in Poland. Everything I do, every doctor i go to I must pay by myself.  
Dysphoria is really kicking my butt these days and I feel bad whenever I look in the mirror.   
My relationship with my family is also not the best. They don't know anything about my transition and when I suggest them that I have gender dysphoria - they immediately change the subject. My studies also get on my head a lot - I'm late with some projects and my grades are not really the best.   
I just feel being more and more under the weather everyday, it started with just some time every day, but it keeps getting worse. Currently I'm functioning kind-of normally, but I just can't do anything other than lay in my bed and look on the ceiling when not at the uni or not in work.

People fake it, okay, that’s our reality. But don’t bunch us in with all of the other fucking idiots who want attention. If I see a meme that says something about Billie Eilish or whatever, and then 14 year old girls with ‘depression’, I’m fine with that, because the quotes displays that they don’t really have a mental illness. However, if I see something that generalizes us into that group, it makes me outraged. We don’t go around saying “HEY LOOK EVERYONE, I GOT SAD YESTERDAY SO I FUCKING CUT MYSELF.” No! That’s not how it fucking works! You might have one or possibly even two people that you can trust enough with that information, but we don’t run around telling it to people we barely know.

67,"Like many, I once underestimated what the requirements and responsibilities of work can do to your mental health. For many years I had been operating on highly strung autopilot, determined to fulfill my potential as an employee and work my way towards the top of my field.

Six years after leaving University, what did I have to show for it? Yes, I'd progressed at work and I had built a good reputation for myself, but I hadn't appreciated that my mental health had taken a nosedive. I certainly wasn't at the level I wanted to be in my profession.

At the end of last year, I was diagnosed with moderate to severe anxiety and depression. The pressures of work and the lack of care I had given myself over the years had finally caught up with me.

When I switched jobs earlier this year, one of my main aims was to address my work/life balance. It's safe to say that this has definitely benefited my mental health and whilst I'm not quite there yet, I've been able to work towards recovery one day at a time. Some things I have done to address the balance are not looking at emails once I'm home, switch my work phone off and do everything I can after work to unwind. 

My message for you is to reflect on your work and the role it has on your mental health. Everybody is different and we definitely don't all have the same triggers, but are there little things you can do to adjust your work/life balance?",27Nov2019,1
68,"On the whole life is bad, it has been bad for years now. I remember being asked by my gp about a year ago now if life is good, I lied and said yes. I lied because I couldn't trust my mother, I couldnt risk her finding anything out about me. She seemed to enjoy telling whoever she was on the phone to any new detail she found out about me. She believed I could not hear her when she was down stairs and I was upstairs, but I would often stand, not breathing, listening. She could not keep her mouth shut. I do not trust her now nor will I ever trust her again. I couldnt have the rest of my family finding out either, but that is because I did not want to worry them, and I still do not want to worry them. They can keep quiet, they are normal. Afaik my mother was on antidepressants before she even had me. Mentally ill people like that should not be allowed to have children. You might take some self righteous view that its a human right, but I know better than you. I know what it has caused, you are either uninformed or a deluded moron if you think it is a good thing for these people to have children.

I wish I had never existed. The parts that make life worth living, experiences that bring satisfaction are further and further apart. I have memories between the ages of 7 and about 13 of being satisfied, I was in control of myself even if I had no freedom. Now I have more freedom having moved away for university, but I no longer have control. I enjoy being asleep, but I stay awake until 3 in the morning and get out of bed gone midday. I can finally do practically whatever I want without my piece of shit mother screaming or nagging, but I dont have anywhere to go

I do not intend to commit suicide. I have thought about it many times, but I have never planned it and I do not intend to plan or go through with it. I do wish I had never existed. The net balance of my life has made it an unpleasant experience

70,"Good day everybody! So back about 6 years ago, I went through this little episode in middle school or whatever, you can call it a phase because that’s really what it was and I ended up being diagnosed with MDD. I eventually tried self harming and continued doing it for very stupid reasons. I was a very lost, impressionable kid and I hung out with a group of people who were also depressed and were cutting and I basically followed along not knowing what I was actually doing but since they were doing it, I would too. So I followed along and kept doing it even though it did nothing for me but bring attention from them and now there’s a bunch of scars on my left wrist that I necessarily don’t want to be there.

It’s been an incredibly long time since I’ve had any symptoms, about 5-6 years, and I’ve grown out of that “phase” so I went back to see the Psychiatrist for an evaluation and I was cleared of everything.

With all of that said, I’m just about to graduate and plan on attending the Law Enforcement Academy and I’ve disclosed everything to the academy counselors and the agency I plan on working for so they are aware of my past history and they said as long as I’ve been cleared and all that, I should be good to go. (Emphasis on the should because it’s still questionable)

My concern however is just the visible scars on my arm that are clearly visible and indicate previous self harm because that looks absolutely horrible, especially for someone in Law Enforcement that has to constantly be in high risk situations (Because cutting is known for being used as a coping mechanism in stressful situations when you don’t necessarily know how to cope with things in healthy ways). In all honesty, it’s just unsightly to me as well. So, if possible, I’d like to make them less visible or disappear entirely.

Are there any ways to achieve this? Is it possible?

I was writhing in discomfort and it felt like I was playing it up at the gym out of insecurity, but I really don't know.

Long story short it worked very well but I basically have very few emotions at this point and well, it frankly sucks. 

The reason why I did that in the first place was that I went through a very rough breakup and was depressed for a year to the point where I literally couldn't do anything. Got tired of that said ""f*** this I'm out"" and completely closed myself off to those emotions. 

I also completely closed myself off to the idea of a relationship plus the prospect of being happy and adopted a very nihilistic philosophy where my greatest belief was that life is suffering and that you simply have to persevere, that happiness is unobtainable etc. 

After having somewhat of a moment of clarity I realized just how unhappy and downright depressed I was I decided that perhaps I actually want a relationship and I actually want to be happy instead of constantly torturing and forcing myself to simply march towards my goals no matter the cost.

I don't show much emotion on the outside, so people just assume I'm okay even when I tell them I'm not. The last few days I've texted several friends that I've had obsessive thoughts about selfharm the last few weeks(though I haven't acted on it), and they were sympathetic then and there but afterwards it seems like they just forget about it.
The only place I actually feel happy and good is at work. I love my job, and I'm actually good at it, and my coworkers are great! I only wish I was there full time, but I only work a few days a week(not because I want to, they just don't need more people). I kind of feel like there isn't any rational reason for me to feel so shitty right now. I mean, I love my job and I just finished my bachelors degree last week, I just be happy right?

I also have close friends with mental health issues. I value them much and I'm not able to leave them alone with their problems, but I keep thinking I am a bad friend as they still can't solve their problems. I take it so close to my heart, I feel like I can't carry it all on my shoulders, although I don't talk much with my friends about their issues.

I was thinking about asking my friends for their honest opinion of what they think of me but i'm worried if I do i'll end up ruining the friendships or that i'll be coming off as rude. Like everyday i've been getting worse and worse and my feelings are just eating me on the inside.

97,"I struggle with anxiety and depression. Sometimes I think I have BPD but I’m not sure. I have huge mood swings. I cry a lot. When I’m low I can’t remember when things were better. It feels like someone else’s life. Every tantrum or low period stresses the people I lean on. I need help holding all of my emotions and my people, perhaps understandably, don’t want to feel that burden. 

My best friend basically scolded me months ago saying exactly that. And it hurt at the time. But I realized she was just establishing boundaries. 

I’m starting to feel similarly about my boyfriend. Whenever I’m low he is distant, guarded, and overwhelmed. He said I am a “tidal wave” crashing down on him. 

Sometimes I think if I’m alone I will stop thinking that anyone can help me. And I will just try to do it on my own. Like if my best friend and boyfriend are around - I naturally tend to lean on them for support. But if they weren’t around maybe I’d just stop feeling so sorry for myself and do it on my own. And I’ll turn to stone and essentially stop caring about anyone but it’s better than feeling like a tidal wave, a burden. 

What can I do when I feel like I am too much?",27Nov2019,1
98,"20F, third year college student (pre-med, neurology)

I’ve been struggling with my anxiety and depression since I was about 7 or 8. I was recently diagnosed BPD, MDD, panic disorder. I’m taking Zoloft but still adjusting dosage as I’m still struggling with my depression a lot. My grades have been suffering this semester because of my mental health and I feel like I don’t have the emotional capacity to be in school right now. I finally worked up the courage to tell my mom that I wanted to take a break from school (not permanently) and she told me she’ll support me no matter what, which made me feel really good about my decision. at the time, i asked her not to tell anyone in our family because I wanted to tell them myself in my own way, when the time was right. 

Fast forward to now, about a month after I told my mom. I’m spending time with my family for the holidays and I have lunch with my grandma - this was yesterday. My grandma told me that she heard from “someone” that I’m dropping out of school and moving back home. This *really* upset me because that isn’t even true, and the only person I told was my mom - who I specifically asked not to tell anyone. 

Now I’m home for a week with my family, who are spreading rumors amongst themselves about me and now I feel really judged and guilty. I know I don’t owe anyone an explanation but it sucks feeling like I let them down. I met with my therapist yesterday and he told me that if I had cancer and had to take a small leave of absence to get better, nobody would judge me for it. So why is my mental health any different? 

I guess I’m not looking for advice to venting. It sucks having to silently deal with my mental illness because my family doesn’t understand or truly support me.",27Nov2019,1

Even though I know they are right, emotionally it really hurts. Whats worse is that I’m out of school now so even if I make the changes I won’t have enough ppl around me to get enough feedback on progress. I daydream about giving ppl speeches about why it’s so hard for me, why so much is out of my control, why it shouldn’t matter to them, etc. but I’m 25 and long out of school, and putting up a speech on social media might only make it worse. I’m a maladaptive daydreamer so I waste a lot of time thinking about this, even through fictional characters. 

I know many ppl may comment with the idealistic “there is nothing wrong with being a nerd” “don’t care what ppl think” “you’ll find ppl that accept u for u” etc. but that’s really not what I want. I want to be respected more like a normal person.",27Nov2019,1

He just started burning bridges left and right. 
Additionally he has new social media accounts where he posts non sensical things all day, and a notebook where he writes his thoughts every few minutes. He goes into monologues about how he knows what’s really going on, how everyone bets against him, how he always had the answers and that the rest of us are just deluded and trying to sabotage his truth.

109,"I am currently 18 years of age and am attending university. As far back as junior school I have been having issues with controlling my anger. I am somewhat sure that my issues were due to the bullying I received during primary/junior school, to be honest I wasn't bullied as harshly as one might see in movies or the like, but I was very affected by my classmates attitudes regardless.

Now my violence wasn't much of an issue before high school as play fights were fairly common in my middle school and the ability of a child to injure someone is somewhat limited, I'd usually get told of at most. Moving on to more recent times my ability to control my outbreaks of anger has improved, down to only happening twice a year (still twice a year too much). This is likely due to me taking up karate as a way to vent my stress; unfortunately, whilst practising a martial art may help me reduce the frequency of outbreaks, it doesn't exactly reduce the damage I might cause when I have a moment. In the last year and a half I have ended up in suspension twice due to injuring other students, one of them being a close friend.

Because of this I ended up visiting a therapist, partly of my own will, in the end they only really helped me pinpoint the circumstances and emotions that caused me to lash out. And whilst that's a feat in itself, I'd be lying if I didn't hope for more. (The circumstances being: when someone has me pinned in a corner, either physically or argumentatively, due to a reasoning that does not match with mine.) 
 
Onto the point now, my outbreaks are always due to a build up in stress, being at uni for two months now has most certainly induced a lot of stress and my general mood is on a slow decline. Essentially I want to know if anyone has some methods that they use to vent their anger (save martial arts which I already practise). This is because I really don't want to injure someone at uni, as regardless of the injury I might cause, the further (timewise) you go in educational/work related institutions, the worse the punishments are. 

I am aware that I have disclosed a lot of non-specific information in this post and whilst some of it may help you help me, or help you by being relatable, most of it is just in the form of a confession as there aren't many people I wish to talk to this about this to in person.",27Nov2019,1

133,"Hi all (new redditor here, this is actually my first post)

I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed lately as I've been a little swamped by life, and as a result my mental health has gotten worse. I have been diagnosed with generalised anxiety and PTSD (I was hit by a freightliner when I was 18, I was driving with two passengers, I should be dead and I should have killed them, but miraculously we're alive) and depression as a secondary illness (when I'm struggling with anxiety and PTSD the depression kicks in). Recently I've started having bad dreams again, about driving and hurting people in my car again, but also about failing people and my pets getting hurt and me not being able to save them and not wanting to eat. I would get so worked up in my dreams I'd scream and break down, and then I'd wake up with these dreams being so vivid and confusing I felt as though I hadn't slept. I started twitching, my legs would uncontrollably bounce (they're so sore), I couldn't concentrate at all on a task for longer than 5 minutes, I felt as though I had absolutely no control in my dreams or awake. I became so exhausted reliving my nightmares, I finally snapped last night and I broke down. I reached out, which is unusual for me, to two dear friends who have both suggested I need professional help. I think they're right, although seeing a professional really terrifies me. I didn't seek professional help until a year and a half ago, where I was put on Zoloft (thank fuck) and regularly saw a psych. I left the appointments overthinking the concept of the thoughts I would overthink. This was also a huge financial burden, especially now I am really struggling financially and I don't have the money to see a professional. I'm really scared to go back to someone for help as I'm hardly surviving financially as it is, factoring in a psych seems unrealistic, maybe even impossible. And then, if I miraculously can afford to go, how exactly do I tell a professional who seemingly has their life together, all of the above information and that my life is a mess without them wanting to call a mental institution? When I imagine going in and sitting down, I either imagine sitting completely silent in the corner for an hour or I imagine bursting into tears and bawling the whole time. Does anyone have any tips for getting passed this feeling? I'm so scared to sit down with a stranger and show them how vulnerable and damaged I really am.

Also, making this post is terrifying in itself to me. I'm scared to open myself up to people I know and love, much less strangers, however I think at this point I could really use some help, and it helps that no one knows who I am (although if you have figured out who I am with the information given please keep that to yourself, don't even tell me.

I don’t have insurance and can’t afford therapy, so I’m not going to be able to go back there. According to their tests they diagnosed me with severe depression/anxiety. I feel hopeless but can’t find help. Feel like when I tried I wasn’t given anything. Is there other options for me?",27Nov2019,1
135,"So, yesterday I had an extremely busy day, and where I am usually a busy person this day had a darker toll on my brain. 

At first I had to wake up and get ready, I drove 45 minutes to attend my English upgrade class. It is an adult education program that allows students to complete upgrades at your own pace. I was able to hand in assignments and complete a quiz. 

After that I went to go call my mother because I wanted to go visit her. She was home and told me I could come over. However, she had some bad news to tell me over the phone. My Sisters husband's father had passed away from cancer that morning and with that my mother was babysitting my neice. I went over for a coffee and the visit was very brief and sweet. We talked about how hard my sister worked to make sure that everything was organized when the inevitable time of her father in law's death came. This hurt me to imagine all of the stress my sister had to go through.

I had to leave because I had to go straight to work, it is a 40 minute drive and I had just found out on the news that there was snow on the roads. I was a few minutes late for work due to the weather, and due to the fact I forgot I needed to fill up for gas. Arriving at work was good, my boss was understanding of me being late because of the weather.

Work was stressful.

I work in sales, and I sell mobile phones. Now there are some days that are heavy on sales which can be overwhelming, but this day was all about fixing the issues that customers had with their recently purchased devices. For about 3 hours I was juggling through customers being the solution to their problems. I dealt with mostly easy going customers, but some customers were very rude to me and my other co-workers. It just wasn't a good day for us at work. I felt mentally drained at this point. I wanted to go home and sleep.

Near the end of my shift it slowed down and I was able to get my brain back in order, but I still wasn't feeling 100%. My plans for after work were to go to my girlfriend's town, which is approximately 1 hour away. I had last minute customers that got me working a bit late. This stressed me out because my girlfriend was out having drinks with her family and they were waiting for me. I ended up getting out of work 15 minutes later which was shorter than I expected. I drove to my girlfriend's town and straight to the bar they were at. I was still in my work clothes.

Upon my arrival to the bar my girlfriend and her family (mother and sister) were already a few drinks in and were intoxicated. I only had one beer because I had to drive them all home. I finished my beer but they continued drinking for just over an hour. I was getting really tired and bored. This relationship is new so I have only been with her family a couple of times. After they finished up I drove them home and it was just me and my girlfriend. 

Then it hit me.

I shut down. I felt like something broke me, I had just wanted to go lay down and sleep. And after arriving at my girlfriends place where I was staying the night, I did just that. My girlfriend was still drinking when we got to her place and I didn't want to join. I was in a negative mind set and I knew it wouldn't be wise to drink. I layed in her bed and closed my eyes.

The house went quiet, I was half awake because I was wondering where she went. I ended up getting up to look for her. I found her in the bathroom with her head in the toilet, she had too much to drink and got sick. She couldn't take care of herself so I had to stay with her. It took me over an hour to get her to the shower and to bed.

I don't usually post on reddit. But I feel like some times when I have a 'day' it's just too much. And I am allowed to feel what I feel. But the morning after it still weighed on me like an oversized backpack. I was still mentally numb. I recall just laying in bed staring at the ceiling. Thinking about nothing. Just incapacitated.

I just wanted to vent. I feel as this was the subreddit to do it in. And please excuse my skills in writing. I am working on it.

Tl;dr - I had a very busy and dramatic day that knocked me down to my mental knees. I found out I lost a family member, I had a stressful day at work, and immediately after I had to take care of my girlfriend when she got sick after a night of drinking.",27Nov2019,1

I feel like killing myself just to stop the constant confusion I can’t take it anymore why won’t it just fucking end I’m doing everything I’ve been told to do. I’m social I’m doing good in school I walk everyday I’m trying to get help because I need to find out if I have bpd aswell.

138,"I've been like this for a year or two, and it went from me being happy and healthy to just.. bored. Bored of everything, tired of the things that I enjoyed, and not able to really want to be around people. I don't talk to my parents about this stuff, and I have virtually no one to express myself around. I want to be a femboy, and no one approves. So I don't do it. I like to talk about guns/weapons, and no one cares. So I do it myself. I can't be normal, and do normal things without being bored or negative. It hurts that my relationship is suffering because I fail to be interested in what she tries to do with me. She gets upset when I won't suggest something to do, and it kills me because I don't enjoy hardly anything. What I do enjoy, I do myself and it's personal things like writing or drawing. I keep my sketchbook handy, but I never show anyone because of how personal it is. My sexuality makes me uncomfortable and it's hard to deny who I am at times, because I get bullied either way. People are mean to me because I'm different, and I don't know if I should just be myself and face it, and probably get in trouble, or suppress the true me just so people will like me. I keep bouncing back and forth between wanting to be popular and wanting to blend into the background and be unnoticed. What I really want is a friend I can talk to about everything. Or maybe I don't, I don't even know what I want half the time. I live in a small town, and I value the opinions of everyone there and what they think of me

TL;DR I'm struggling over whether to maintain my own personality just so people will like me, or keep getting bullied because I can't get excited about anything or be social and normal like everyone else.",27Nov2019,1

140,"I am a mess both physicaly and mentaly . I went through 3 surgeries for my leg but i still can barely walk . It has been over half a year since last one .I should've been able to play sports dance and do other things for 2 months already. I never had a girlfriend not because i couldn't but because i dont believe anybody can actually love me. Even if I am attracted to them i push them away because they deserve someone much better then me. Or at least stable emotionally . I couldn't find anything of value in myself for like 6 years now. I am avarage looking at best, a little bit overweight due to me eating when under stress and lack of exercise, balding at the age of 19 and pretty poor. I pay that much attention to looks maybe because my friend who is suffering with much more mental ilnesses (because of his crazy traumatic life) is very handsome . In eyes of potential partners his mental health is worth it because he is at least hot(one of them has actually told me this). He has much more confidence and acceptence of himself than i do because of it. I already went to psychologist and she pretty much said that i am normal but very strict with myself. But when i was walking down the street yesterday i was hoping all the way for car to hit me. When it seemed like it might i closed my eyes and accepted it . When it passed me I realized how fucked up I am to hope to leave my family and friends behind. How can i deal with this? Should i ask for medication or force myself to trust other people and tell them what i am going through ?

I have a massive fear of them leaving me or being abandoned or left out and it becomes a cycle and I get really attached to them. I constantly think others are upset, fed up of me or angry at me and I constantly ask over and over again are you mad at me because it will be a small thing and I feel like they just are. And then they get fed up because I never stop asking and doing it. I do the same thing with constantly asking if they care and then dismissing it because it's so hard for me to believe but I need reassurance constantly. But it makes me happy when someone convinces me they care. And when I feel like they don't I get so depressed and even suicidal. I have these massive outbursts like my anger it's explosive and so hard to control and I take it out on the people that mean the most to me. I feel like I'm dramatic for example when I feel like the tiniest thing someone said it makes me feel like they don't care ill do things like leave groupchats block people delete accounts but all the while ill come back because I can't bear to be alone and I just want certain people and I can't stand it.

I had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which I never believed I had, and that belief itself that I was a genius and not sick empowered me. i studied jc's teachings, and applied them, and Maimonides teachings and applied them, lived a normal life, went to the beach, went to Tony Robbins, prayed to God, and ate right and exercised, become vegetarian, got off the heavy pills, and I got well super fast and have been well since June.

147,"I was born and raised mormon.  From the day I left the womb, my life was on rails.

I was to participate in church, get my Eagle Scout award, go on a mormon mission, go to Brigham Young University, get married, have kids, and continue to serve in the mormon church.

Simple, right?  

I did all those things in order. I got my Eagle Scout award at 14. I went on my mission to South America. I got married to a knock-out woman and we had kids right away. I started my career in advertising on the West Coast. God was happy with me, and my friends and family respected me.

Except nothing felt right.  Everything felt wrong. I felt angry and depressed all the time.  I thought it might be because God was punishing me for some sin I wasn't aware of. So I doubled down on my efforts to be good and faithful.

I worked harder everywhere - at my job, in the church, in my religious studies.  I focused on my family.  I pushed all my chips in on what I was taught would bring me lasting happiness.

But nothing worked. I thought there must be something horribly wrong with me. I disclosed to my wife that I was wanted to kill myself.  She forced me to see a psychologist who put me on meds.  About four weeks later, the meds started to take effect.  Turns out it wasn't God or Satan wreaking havoc in my brain.  It was just a bunch of chemicals. Huh.

As my state of mind continued to improve, I also continued to work as hard as I could on the Mormon path.  I continued my studies into the church, hoping I could find some nugget of truth that would help propel me into everlasting happiness.

What I found felt like a kick in the chest.  Mountains upon mountains of evidence that the faith I grew up in - the faith that guided my entire life up to that point - was nothing more than a 19th century scam.

I panicked.  I kept my feelings to myself.  I continued to attend church hoping I could forget what I had learned about my faith.  It didn't work.  

Finally I took to the Internet to chat with strangers who had been in similar circumstances how they handled participating in a faith that they no longer believed in.  I spent hours scanning through replies and suggestions.  Eventually I fell asleep on my couch.  I woke up to sobbing.

I left my laptop open, and my wife saw my question.  She was devastated that I had lost my faith - and that I didn't tell her I didn't believe anymore.  I tried to tell her that I was afraid, and was looking for advice anonymously before I did anything - but that did not help.

She looked me dead in the eye and told me ""I don't even know you anymore.""  The next morning she went to her parents home. What followed over the next few weeks were similar conversations with my parents, siblings, in-laws, friends, neighbors.  All people who had known and loved me my entire life expressing the same sentiment - ""I don't know you anymore.""

A lifetime of shared laughs, smiles, cries, secrets, jokes - all out the door in an instant.  

I felt like an outsider - because I was one.  I wanted desperately to keep my family intact, so I did whatever it took to do that.  I continued to attend church even though I was a known pariah. I continued to attend family events.  I did my best to be a good father and earner, because that's what good Mormon husbands and fathers do.  But the people I loved most continued to keep me at arms length.

I'd like to tell you things got better over time.  In some respect, they did.  My wife eventually did leave the church about six years later. She credits me with paving the way for our entire family being free of Mormonism.  My Dad left the church as well. 

But what hurts the most is that no one acknowledges the pain and isolation they put me through during those first few weeks, months and years of my experience.

And while I've done my best to rebuild my identity through new friends, hobbies and experience, I don't know that I'll ever be able to recover from being completely rejected from the people who knew me and loved me the most.

That's all.  Thanks for reading if you made it this far.",27Nov2019,1
148,"I love my mother and I am generally close with her, however I find her incredibly annoying as a person, which makes me feel bad because she hasn't done anything wrong? Firstly there are just little habits and stuff, like she makes weird movements or stretches in public, says 'yes yes yes' after everything she says, or talks down to everyone and overexplains which just irritates me. Then she has a weird victim complex kinda thing where she assumes everything's a personal attack, even my breakdowns, panic attacks etc she always responds by going on about how bad I make her feel which just makes me more upset than anything. Sometimes it's just the face she makes, or the way she laughs when I'm visibly stressed, harmless stuff like that which I know she doesn't mean. 
It feels weird because I know I love her and I feel unreasonable for being so annoyed by her. At first I thought it was due to a combination of stress and screwed up hormones from my anorexia, but even now with a lot less stress and a lot more food, although my general irritability has decreased I still find her annoying. I also thought it may just be a 'teen' thing but the reasons I find her annoying are less about our relationship and more just her as a person?

At the end of the day I'm exhausted but can't sleep. When i sleep i have nightmares about people in life that have hurt me, abused me, want me dead. 

If i go out and see one of the two people I occasionally meet with its repetitive and boring. I watch a movie to get my mind off of currently existing but it's all fake. I make something or read a book and its all pointless. I look at cats and cute stuff online and i instinctively smile but i still feel horrible on the inside. 

I noticed, hapiness doesn't really exist. I have fond memories in high school where objectively in real life in that moment i was constantly miserable. I sometimes get bouts of hapiness if i wake up right but if i stop and ask myself how i feel at that moment or try to be mindful of it, it completely goes away and doesn't return. 

Basically I do all this so that i can do it again tomorrow and again the day after and so until I die. 

And like the only thing keeping me from ending it all is that, if i kill myself, from the perspective of the grand eternal nothing afterwards, it won't matter if i did it today, tomorrow or 20/40/60 years from now. So i just postpone it.

160,"( Crossposted from r/NHS )

So at the beginning of October my GP put in a referral for CAMHS (which I now know was sent off end of October) for an OCD assessment and treatment of some kind. At that point he said I was probably bordering on not meeting their criteria and it would take 8 weeks for an assessment then a possible 6-16 weeks (I think, it was a while ago) wait before any treatment began.

I then was told to go to one of the Local Mental Health Services and have had two hours with a Wellbeing Practitioner, who has decided I’m above what she’s qualified to help (I’ve gotten a lot worse, not able to get out of bed, daily panic attacks, hours of compulsions, it’s messy) and is putting in another referral to CAMHS.

Now, all I’m wondering, is what in the hell are the actual CAHMS criteria (eg should I even be wasting my time with the long waiting lists or just take what the Wellbeing Practitioner can give)?

And, will two referrals do anything? Jump me up the list? Or is it just another piece of paper in the stack like my other one from the GP.

Also, will my referral about me now unable to get out of bed etc make my case faster?

Thanks for any input, I simply want to be seen as quick as possible, as I’m bordering on not able to function on a day to day basis now.

One loves halfway across the country, the other leaves me to hang out with upperclassmen and more “popular” people(they’ve even told me I want popular to my face), the third one is the only one I actually hang out with now, and the fourth one goes to a different school. And he’s been seeing someone and I’ve been crying every day because I’m so terrified at the thought of everyone leaving me. And I really and truly will be by myself. I’ve been hating myself more and more telling myself I’m toxic and a burden and selfish and an idiot. And I believe each and every word. And there’s this stupid boy I like but he has a girlfriend and he tried making moves on me so her and her friends started bullying me and texting me and harassing me. And he told me to wait because his girlfriend was stupid and I’m way better and he doesn’t think the relationship is going to last. So I did, and he finally told me he chooses her. And I want to tell her how he tried kissing me and he insulted her behind her back but every time I see him I instantly forgive him like an idiot. I’ve thought so many times lately how easy it would be for me to go downstairs and just od on my meds. I keep wishing that this is all a bad dream and I’ll wake up back in eight grade when everything still sucked but at least I had my friends with me and they made me feel home. Now nowhere feels like home. And I hate myself so much. And I’m just so so scared to be alone. I don’t want them to forget about me. I want it to stop hurting so god damn much.",27Nov2019,1
162,"Hello. I am female, 18. My roommate is a good friend of mine, a friend I know is normally happy and outgoing.I am living with him because he let me, was living on the streets prior. I'm getting concerned for my safety, and his safety. I don't want to sound selfish. After all, i don't pay the rent still due to me living here being a temporary thing. Pretty sure I''l be outta here in December. But personally, he's a good good friend and I hate seeing him like this. I fear he'd kill himself one day. Worst case scenario, he'd kill me out of anger. His anger issues are his main problem, along with self-hatred. He has a really toxic mindset, one I used to have. Where, he thinks therapy won't help him and that they'd only lie to you. I have gotten the help I need, I am still GETTING help.. It hurts me knowing that help is RIGHT out there and he's looking the other way. He has a racial prejudice too. Believes that since I'm ""white"", i get the help I need. Since he's ""black"", no one cares. Honestly, I don't know why he firmly believes that but I think it has something to due with his mom. Since she passed away due to MS. Obviously, that's not true. Your race doesn't matter in America when it comes to that- not to this extent anyways. The psych ward I went to was mostly ""black"" people. The doctors and care providers, not just the patients. 

&amp;#x200B;

His anger issues revolve physical shit too, that gets annoying. I don't think he means to hurt me, he just tells me im just sensitive. I don't think he realizes that he's stronger than I'd ever be. He acts like a child a lot. Never syas sorry and kinda shuts down when I tell him he hurts me. He also has a prejudice against women, due to I guess(?) the women that ghost him online. Complains about that a lot and I can tell it really affects him. He is very conservative, showing skin =  whore. Having FWBs = a whore. Having any guy friends = a slut. I still don't know whether he fully believes that or not, he does get angry at me for it a lot though. Almost all the fights we've gotten in was caused due to his attitude. He'd be really grumpy and no matter how many good things happen or get said to him, he'd still be pissed. Counteract that with his more manic moods, where he's a jumping bean basically. 

&amp;#x200B;

It wasn't til today where I found out he may or may not be hearing voices. I overheard him downstairs yelling at someone. Legit, the convo sounded like he was talking to a real person. I thought he was on the phone and when i got down there, there was no one and e got defensive. He said he was just talking to himself, but i doubt that : /

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, i dont know what to do. i feel really bad and i feel stuck. i just want him to be his normal happy self but it seems to be getting worst and worst and it is affecting my mental well-being as well. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",27Nov2019,1
163,"I suspect that something's wrong with my mental health, but I can't really pin down exactly what to look for or where to ask for help.

I am kinda lost about where to begin but I think a good starting point would be talking about my academic performance. 

I've started going to college this year. 

I usually notice that people who get bad grades at college are usually people who aren't that much interested in the class and/or have a good excuse to not prioritize college (i.e. they have to work, they have children, they have to take care of their parents, etc). Sometimes people can't keep up with a class because they have a very consuming social life, and that's also an excuse. 

In the other hand, I don't fit in any of the reasons why people get bad grades. I don't have to work, I don't have to take care of pretty much anything but myself and I don't have any social life to distract me from college. Plus, I genuinely like what I'm studying, so the ""uninterested"" part is also out of the question. 

I have pretty much absolutely no reason to fail classes, and yet somehow I get bad grades at everything.

It's humiliating and it makes me feel stupid because most people seem to have either a good academic performance, or if they don't you can easily assume that they have a good reason not to. 

I would diagnose myself with Asperger's (because I present some symptoms based on my weird social behaviors) and/or another mild functional retardation (I don't know which word to use, though I legitimately perceive myself as mentally handicapped) but of course I am no profesional nor a qualified person to have an official say in the matter.",27Nov2019,1

I love her. but I can't take any of this. why is no one listening to me. I'm not good. I will push you away, not because I don't like you but because I don't like me. why doesn't she leave me so I can be done?",27Nov2019,1

167,"One thing I hate about my anxiety/mental restlessness is that it makes it really hard for to focus. As a result, everything takes more time and energy than it should. This affects my work and my personal life. Right now, for example, I’ve just finished my workday. I feel mentally tired and ready to quit for the day. But, because I have trouble focusing, I didn’t accomplish nearly as much today as I could have. And having so many days like that affects my self-esteem. I just would love to be able to focus and work efficiently and have a full and productive day and enjoy the feeling of accomplishment that comes with that.",27Nov2019,1

169,"Basically I’m trying to sue my parents. Over deliberately disciplining me. I think I was unfairly treated. Here are some cases where they took it too far.
1. Broke my Xbox and pulled my shirt trying to get me to leave
2. I hit the door like my dad always does and he came out and made my finger bleed
3. Can’t be specific so just gonna name as much as possible: Excessively yelling at me and threatened to hurt me with belt, remember he made my sister cry because she was trying to help me, sister admits they “didn’t discipline her in the best way”, plus admits to being treated worse than me

Honestly, I think the issue is mainly my dad. He’s retarded in a sense. He has anger issues for sure, and I’m sure he influenced me to have them. A couple years ago I didn’t even know why I was hitting back at them. These acts of “aggression” got me in a mental hospital. I’m sure it was his fault, because one night I had enough. I started fighting with him. And my mom got in the way so then they called the cops. My sister says since she got it worse why isn’t she aggressive? Let me just start by saying, if you’re the type to get offended easily stop reading. She was a young girl, and a skinny one too. I’m a big boy (lol). I’m sure you can notice the difference, especially since I realized all he was doing wrong. She was in Mexico most of the time, which have different laws and are more cultural. Now back to my dad, can I sue him? He’s inflicted a lot of damage between the family. Especially towards me. Everyone sided with his mentality. My mom, cared more about my dad than me. I realized this when I was getting pushed by cops, illegally. She didn’t do anything. She just watched me get pushed. Then I had enough and tried to go through. They tried grabbing me. I punched them. I had not done anything at all to get arrested. It started when I said “I’m gonna go chill off in my room”. My mom is always looking to be dominated by my dad. She always listens to him, every time he would bullshit to us. We would fire back. She would be like “ Don’t say that to him” at that point I would always be like “b stfu”. She’s pretty much a loyal thot. And my sister is pretty much the same. They can’t realize how stupid this man is. Discipline... more like influencing me to hit as well. Keep in mind I only was hitting before, when I was younger. Now I just act verbally aggressive. It’s the only thing that keeps me sane. Literally spent years on just a shitty phone. You don’t get how much time I’ve gotten bored. How unfairly I was treated. How much I wonder if the next five years of my life will be with this shitty phone. Then what? Gonna get kicked out. No lawyer no nothing. Should I just go for adoption? Or you know what. If these years are gonna be this boring, and I’m gonna still have that big ass grudge on my back. Oh and I forgot to mention! I don’t even try anymore at school. Most people are driven by recognition by their parents. Then get the normal things bought. I was driven by recognition. Until that time... in the 4th grade  believe, the fight. After that my effort immediately depleted. They bought me the Xbox then to cheer me up. Also because I could have had a tumor. And then they destroyed it. Now I’m lost, words themselves can not explain how stupid this phone is. All I can do is rage at the little games I can play on this without crashing or lagging. I don’t put effort into school anymore. Never probably will. Not if I don’t even get something to entertain myself. They say “get better grades” and I’ll get stuff. But the truth is I was getting good grades. And they would always say “behave more”. This was before the incidents, and before I would act aggressive to them. I’ve pretty much gave up now. Stupid promises never kept. Now at this point there’s like no turning back. My grudge still lives on inside me. I’m not just gonna accept what they all did to me. What should I do? Again. Wait 4 years, get nothing in those four years. And go into poverty when they kick me out? I doubt they will pay college. I doubt I will even have enough money for a lawyer. My story will go unheard. Up until the moment I die from a heart attack or just decide it was a good run. Or my last option. Go into adoption. I’m pretty sure that’s how it works at least. I could get a new life, but is it good? Will I have the same school? Or will they just never pick me because I’m “mentally ill”. Please answer, I’ve got nothing to do. I just think about my future.

170,"So I’ve been wondering for years if I have anxiety, it seems to fit, but less so since I’ve finished school.

It was basically like a switch was flicked, I used to be so afraid of how people perceived me and who was really my friend and if people were just using me, I would be to afraid to answer questions i knew the answer to or speak to anyone I hadn’t established some sort of a connection to, and all these things are still the case just the feeling of fear is less intense and I’m less bothered by it.

However when it comes to relationships with friend and SO I still get thoughts of, this person doesn’t love me/this person is going to leave me or they’re all just using me they all laugh at me behind my back and think I’m an idiot, they only tolerate me for X reason. I also very rarely just randomly feel really hot, like I’m embarrassed and my heart rate increases and breathing gets shallow and then I think “shit I hope no one can tell I’m not 100% okay Rn” and it gets worse and then passes after 15 minutes or so.

My gf says she thinks I have a mental disorder of some sort (she herself having generalised anxiety and depression) and my oldest friend said I have anxiety.

And I’m sick of having these thoughts they’re draining, and whenever something slightly negative happens it gets worse. Like I’ll be having a good time and my brain will just go “this person said or did this, it’s probably because they think X about you or are trying to do X to you” or everything will be A okay hanging out with my gf’s and friends and I’ll leave the room to take a shit and my brain will just go “5 minutes is enough time for a quickie, they could fuck and you would never know”.

TLDR:
Basically hate my brain sometimes, I think I may have anxiety and so does my oldest friend and was wonder on how to get a diagnosis or if getting one is even worth it because I feel like even if I do it’s a very mild case of anxiety or whatever it is I might have.",27Nov2019,1

&amp;#x200B;

So I have friends with BPD/EUPD (Bordeline/ Emotionally Unstable personality disorder), most of whom I met while in hospital. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression last year and have been on medication since, but i feel as though I have something else as well. I'll  have times where I am very easily triggered, and being triggered makes me react in over-the-top ways, for example I smashed my phone a few weeks ago because I was angry at online comments, so I can go from 0-100 pretty quick.  I struggle with really horrible intrusive thoughts, like sudden images or urges to act violently, or horrible sexual thoughts. I also have in the past struggled with self-harm and binge-eating, but im trying to get better at not doing these things. I guess I'm just wandering if these symptoms do sound like a personality disorder, or if they are just aggrevated symptoms of depression and anxiety together.",27Nov2019,1
172,"i'm convinced this isn't reality, it's been so long it's felt like an eternity. never-ending solitude, constant mental breakdowns where I feel dissociated from myself. I face a never ending cycle of the deterioration of my mind.

I want to die and soon I won't be scared enough to go through with it. The only peace of mind I have is when my body responds to the stress and anxiety with depersonalization to make me feel dead, yet I'm alive, this world is my purgatory. 

It can't be real. I have to die, I want to find the exit, I want to wake up. 

I love fiction, it takes me someplace else, let's me live life through someone else. I just finished cowboy bebop and absolutely loved it.

173,"Nothing I do is ever good enough for myself. I see other people in my real life, in my family, on social media, around campus... and I'm jealous of them. 

If I want to do an activity with other people or around them, I see how much better they're all doing than I am. If I take up a hobby I see the masters and know I'll never be that good. I'm aware I wont build skills overnight logically, but I still feel like a failure when I dont. 

I hear about how my old friends and classmates are doing and feel insecure because I've done nothing with my life. No friends, bad grades, boring job, no social life, nothing. 

I tried to make a new Instagram and follow people who inspired me and who are like me (mainly other plus sized women) to feel better about myself. But I just compare myself to every girl I follow... how her hair is nicer, her waist is smaller, her boobs are more even, her butt is bigger, her hips are smoother...how shes just more beautiful overall. I read the messages about ""how somebody elses beauty doesnt detract from your own"" but I cant internalize it. When I see somebody beautiful I realize I've lost, and tear myself to shreds.

I now hate the hospital and Im Canceling all my appointments I'm quitting all medication and going back to just smoking weed
Seriously I feel so terrible right now because of this, I hate that place and myself I regret ever going and ever going to the Dr and hospital itself.
I don't understand why people have to treat others so poorly and I don't even care at this point the damage is done and I'm not going back
I was already having a really hard time lately and this just pushes me over the edge.
I hope withdrawal from my meds kill me. 
At least then I can be with friend again and not ever get treated like shit again.
