1,I broke up with my girlfriend or as what I would like to think of it as a big extended break until I get back to myself. I don’t feel anything towards her or anyone after my trauma. Well I do feel stuff towards people just not passionately or interested in them although I am getting better by the day. My trauma happened a month ago and it was drug related in which I had a bad experience on a physcadelic drug and since then I have been in bad states but my mood has  picked up the past week. The first week I thought I was very depersonalized and not in reality. I had extreme anxiety and depression for that week aswell but these have gone completely. I am just left with this emotional numbness that I just can’t quite shake although I feel it’s fading.I have started EMDR. I just want advice on if this was the right thing to do as I felt I just would’ve have been unfair to her in the relationship by trying to fake it until I get back to a place where I feel comfortable. Thoughts and advice please ?,26Mar2019,1

3,"Hi!

I feel as though I won’t ever be the person I’m supposed to be until I deal with this! I’ve generally had nothing but negativity from people all my life since I was a child which I believe is down to my appearance and race. It’s reshaped my emotions and change me so that I have two personality’s the one that is me and I only reveal to myself and family and the other one that exists and tries to survive in the real world. I remember every single instance of kindness as it was so rare in my childhood,teen years and early adulthood. I’m 29 and still suffer similar instances, I’ve been around a lot of different people and never been lucky enough to meet good ones. I use those few good instances of kindness to help me through difficult times in my life where I regress into depression and refuse to move on! I’m hoping others have found ways to get over an inferiority Complex and lead a successful, happy life and if so what are the everyday steps you’ve taken to help you get there.",26Mar2019,1
4,"I have a massive concentration issue, and a massive 'brain fog', and I have to go a mile a minute at all times, or be signifigantly distracted. I thought it was long term effects of depression, but now that I've dealt with that properly for a few years, I'm assuming something else is wrong.

5,"I’ve always been a very blue person, but a couple of months ago I started to feel very trapped in my life. I constantly find myself thinking about good memories I’ve had and I always feel so alone. Nothing really helps with it so I end up staring at the ceiling most nights. I have a really great family, but I feel like I can’t talk to them about this. The last time I described this, my mom brushed it off as me just needing sleep. So I can’t talk to my parents and my friends have gotten tired of me complaining all the time. The councillors at my school are absolutely horrendous and really annoying. I feel like I’m gonna be this way forever but I’d do anything to stop feeling this way. If anyone is willing to help or offer advice, I’d love to hear you out. ",26Mar2019,1
6,"At what point should you do something if symptoms of mental health conditions show.

I’ve never actually done anything about my anxiety, mostly because it was somewhat a good thing. So far it’s kept me out of bad situations, even if it does make it hard to talk to people or do things. I’m on the fence whether I actually do anything about it.

I don’t see it as a problem, but I think that’s because I’ve had it as long as I can remember. So it seems normal. 

I’m also asking this because as of late I’ve noticed I’m pretty paranoid about everything, this is another thing that’s been happening as long as I can remember, but I’ve started noticing it now. 

It makes for an odd combination, because I end up thinking people are out to get me which then brings anxiety into play. 

But once again. So far it’s kept me out of bad situations and it’s kept me alive, especially with some of the dumb shit I do

Should I do anything about it? Is it worth rocking the boat? ",26Mar2019,1

9,"This isn't for anyone to read, I'm a little drunk and freaking out and I just need to vent into the void.

I had some situations when I was younger. I don't think I'm ready to go into it in detail, but I was pretty fucked up and had a lot of pressure on a child's shoulders. By the time I came out of that and had that pressure relieved, I felt directionless and empty inside. It was like I had this purpose for existing that was life and death with people I loved on the line, and then it was taken away and I was supposed to start caring about trivial shit like a job or an education? I don't know, it felt like nothing mattered. I'd completed what I needed to complete and nothing would ever be that important again. 

I started drinking a lot and eventually decided to end it. There was a big block of flats near my flat at the time, so I took a case of drinks up there and sat on the edge for a while. My plan was to keep drinking until I lost my balance. I don't know why that made me feel better than jumping, but the idea of slipping off was somehow touching. 

Anyway, I kept drinking until this kid came and started talking to me. I say kid, he was probably 16 or 18 or so. I didn't see the point in lying so I told him everything about what had happened and who was to blame. He kept quiet for a bit, and then he told me this amazing thing. He told me that I was up against 100% odds of dying so everything else from here on out was a bonus. If I went slack now, I was dead, and that's fine. Or I could take every last ounce of effort and put it against the person who's fault this was and take him down. Worst case scenario, I come right back here and kill myself.

That kid took me down off the roof. I decided to keep living until every last bit of spite and malice I had left was gone, and then I could die. Along the way, I met the most beautiful, special person I've ever known through absolute fluke. Someone who didn't judge me and didn't feel sorry for me but helped me get better and let go of my past. She honestly changed the way I view the world and let me love her. I married her two years ago and I've been healing slowly since I met her.

She's away tonight with work and I'm sat down with Netflix. I've had a few beers and binge watched a Ricky Gervais show called After Life that's really fucked with me. I didn't know that anyone felt the way I did after coming down from that roof, but that's pretty much the plot of the show. Someone who could have killed himself but didn't and is now living through hate until suicide. I've had to turn it off because it's really fucking with my head. I could have died in 2012. I could have been dead for seven years. I would never have met my wife or bought this house or learned to forgive him for what happened. I was one limp body motion away from missing so much. It's not been easy and I'm not going to call it all happy, but it's been seven years that I wouldn't trade. It scares me to think how close I came on that day among others to robbing myself of so much. I would walk over a million miles of broken glass to get to my wedding day but I almost fell off a shitty tower block with a half finished can of cider instead?

I don't know, I'm having a bit of a panic attack. My mantra when I was in that place was that I hated the sentence ""don't kill yourself because it might get better"". I viewed that sentence as exactly as logical as ""do kill yourself because it might be worse"". I was wrong. The guilt and shame and self-hatred I'm sitting in right now is an awful feeling, but I know that it will pass. Maybe it will last all night, maybe all week, maybe all year, but it will pass. If you're sitting with me now and you can't see that yet, I'm here to talk to you. I couldn't see it once either, but my future life had other plans. You will get there, I promise you.

I'm not here to shill for Ricky Gervais, the show is pretty mediocre and repeats his stand-up sets which is pretty embarrassing, it just hit a nerve.",26Mar2019,11
10,"A (now) ex of mine said those words to me when we were on the verge of breaking up.

Back then I didn’t realise I had BPD. As such I was terrible at understanding its impacts upon myself and our relationship.

We had regular misunderstandings that lead to terrible arguments, that quickly resolved back to passion.

I idolised her, then demonised her.

Now, through therapy, meditation and time, I have come to see my past actions and thoughts through the BPD lens, and have decided to share it.

In this post I deconstruct how BPD impacted the relationship, and what I have learnt from it.

13,"This was a little over a month ago when I was on Strattera at 40mg. 
I completely convinced myself that Strattera was a human experiment drug and I was a test subject. I also believed that everyone I knew was in on the experiment that was being conducted by my psychiatrist and no one could be trusted.
I also believed I needed to delete all forms of social media for a reason that I couldn’t remember, but what I did remember was that it was very important I did this.

So usually psychosis is a long term thing, but this was like 2-3 hours. Never happened again. I got off strattera though, shitty drug nothing but side effects.

14,"Hey everyone,
I don’t really know if this is the right place to post this but I’m gonna give it a shot anyways. About 2 months ago I did shrooms (it was the second time and I had a great time the first) and while the shrooms themselves weren’t really a problem I did end up getting too high on weed and it caused me to have a bad trip and have a panic attack. After that everything was fine for a few weeks but I avoided smoking as much for awhile. Then one day I ended up getting really high again and it make me remember my bad trip and I almost had another attack. Ever since then I’ve felt off and have had pretty bad anxiety almost everyday (I’ve never had anxiety before the incident and I smoked quite often). My anxiety feels like it’s getting worse and worse and I’m really starting to become detached from reality. I’m always so scared of having another panic attack and it’s so overwhelming because I’ve never had feeling like this before. If anyone has been in a similar situation or has any advice for me that would be much appreciated as these last few weeks have been some of the worst of my life.",26Mar2019,0

17,"A while back, I was in a super toxic living situation. I was being manipulated and gaslit pretty badly, though I didn't realize it at the time. It all culminated in a pretty bad nervous breakdown on my part, and the person I had been living with then told everyone that this all happened because I had a severe personality disorder. I was so caught up in her mess that I actually believed that. 

Flash forward to now and I've had to do a lot of work with a therapist and with myself to undo the damage and convince myself that I was not unstable and not the problem in that scenario. But even after all that work, I am struggling to trust other people and I'm struggling to trust myself. It's really severely affected the way I view myself. 

I find myself questioning every emotion I have and wondering if its valid or if it's the product of a mental issue. When I'm feeling upset, I don't talk to anyone about it because I don't want to be accused of being unstable. So instead, I resort to self-destructive or unhealthy coping mechanisms, which then reinforces my fears that there is something severely wrong with me.

All I want is to be able to call up a friend when I'm struggling and vent to them like I used to, but I'm paralyzed with fear about them thinking I'm unstable or accusing me of  being manipulative with my emotions.

I can't just seem to drink one beer anymore, it starts with one, then two, then five beers later I'm drunk and wondering what happened because I was only planning on having one beer.

I don't diet, I starve myself. I've always had issues with food, I thought it was an eating disorder but the more I think about it the more I think it just fits in with this pattern of no moderation. Like I've literally eaten the same meal every night for the last three weeks.

I do it with people too, I'll meet someone and really get along with them and talk to them non stop for a week, then I'll get bored and stop talking to them and they'll have no idea what happened, I've hurt so many guys who thought we were going to end up in a relationship then I just stop talking to them.

I recently told my girlfriend to kill herself out of anger and frustration when she was just trying to help me better myself. She told me I was in denial and helpless because of how defensive I get. She was frustrated with me because of myself being stagnant in life.

My depression demotivates me. I can barely get up in the mornings, can’t keep up to my routines. Can’t really do anything productive.

I spend all day distracting myself in any way I can. And all she did was make this known to me. And I lashed out. I called her a bitch, a cunt, and I told her to fuck off and kill herself.

I regret all of it. Immediately after saying it, I hated it. Why the fuck did I say those things. I destroyed her, all because I was too in denial.

I need to work this out. For her and for me. I can’t keep doing this.

In addition to that, I’m starting a fast-paced, proper, special opportunity to work at my town’s snobby country club.

Its like, my entire life was ruined by a mental disorder and it makes it difficult for me to even perform basic human functions and Ive lost a lot and suffered a lot since I was a kid and it took me so long and many tests, medications, ER/psych ward visits for them to finally get a correct diagnosis and then for someone to just say ""hey, look at this very vague list of symptoms, they sorta apply to me even tho they didnt a minute before I saw the list and now I can act like I know what youre going through"" for an already very rare disorder.

i haven’t been diagnosed with anything, and i can’t go talk to anyone outside of school counselors until next month.

I can’t remember most of the relationship, up to multiple times a day I switch between believing he was severely emotionally abusive to believing that I’m actually a terrible person.

Every thought I have about ANYTHING I immediately think “is that true though?” “Is that really what happened?” “Are you sure you’re not just crazy?” It’s driving me insane.

37,"My girlfriend (30) is suffering from some sort of mental health issue and I'm trying to figure out whats the best approach to move forward.  

It seems she has like some combination of panic/anxiety attacks with some general anxiety / anxiety induced depression but I don't know. Possibly relevant info is her father has bipolar, but what she is experiencing doesn't sound like that to me.

It's been impacting her for most of her life including her childhood and has impacted all her relationships (family, friends, signifiant others). It was a big cause of her last long term relationship breaking up, and has been straining ours (3 years).

She will suddenly get overwhelmed by something, or feel that she's not being understood, which sends her into a rapid downward spiral.  

When an episode starts, it will slowly build up with things getting progressively worse while the seemingly normal discussion or situation continues. She'll slowly become more and more irrational, resort to black and white reasoning and ultimately becomes verbally combative (yelling etc.), and will eventually run off if you can't resolve what's going on and bring her down, leaving the other participant feeling very frustrated / upset with her.  By the time she's running off, the problem is almost never about what was going on, but in the moment that's not always apparent before it's too late.  

I can sometimes see it happening before it's escalated too far and smooth the situation over, but it's really hard sometimes while she's blowing up on me and it feels very personal. 

It can take her hours to fully come back from an episode, and after it's happened she feels very embarrassed. It really impacts her self esteem as it's continued and impacted her relationships over the years. She often says ""I don't want this, I didn't ask for this""

I've seen it happen as frequently as weekly, but a couple of times of month is more common.  Being in crowds can more easily trigger it but not always, and she can be fine in them at other times as well.

She has a very hard time describing the actual feeling often saying she doesn't have the proper words for it, but she describes it as being overwhelmed and lost, sometimes a dark void that she's swirling down into, and she can't figure out how to get out of. She often doesn't see it coming, and by the time it's happening it's often too late or difficult to stop. She says she feels like she missed learning how to cope with these everyday normal situations as a kid, and now she can't. 

Sometimes she can see it happening though and can remove herself from the situation.

She's seen counsellors about it before and they've all basically been telling her she needs to take better care of herself.  Get a full nights sleep, eat properly etc.  Doing this absolutely helps but it doesn't actually prevent episodes from happening or given any reasoning into what's going on with her. She also continues to struggle with these basic things.  None of them have been able to offer any tools to actually help her in an episode, or give useful insight into what is happening.

She raised the possibility of also possibly being depressed with her most recent counsellor but was told didn't think she was...

For eating, she has anxiety over what to eat, with all the conflicting information of what we should or shouldn't be eating, and feels defeated when recipes don't come out as well as she'd hope instead of just trying to tweak it to her liking / attempting to fix it a second time etc.

She feels she has to be perfect when keeping things clean, but she can't keep them perfectly clean so she's a failure. ""Good enough"" isn't enough when it comes to keeping her room clean for example.  But when it's not clean it stresses her out which impacts her eating, or stresses her out during the day as she thinks about having to do it later.

Small things like what to bring to a house party where they want you to bring a home made side dish can highly stress her out.

The anxiety, is common around her normal life, it's not just in these episodes.

At this point she's feeling helpless, worthless, that it's never going to get better etc.  

Which brings us to now...  I think she needs to see a psychologist instead of a counsellor and try to get an actual diagnosis of what might be happening.  She's afraid of seeing someone else again, because it hasn't helped the past 4 times over the years, and I have no idea how to go about finding someone who might be able to help? I'm really worried that if we try again (we tried once already with a counsellor) and she doesn't get some answers or help, that it will be impossible to get her to try again (getting her to be willing to try again now was already really hard)

What can I do to try and help her find someone appropriate who can help her? Is this something a psychologist might be able to properly diagnosis and give us more insight into than what she's gotten in the past?  

We're in Canada if that makes a difference.

38,"Just finished my degree and I’m waiting on (masters) graduate programs to get back to me.  If I don’t get in anywhere, then the rest of that time will go into applying for jobs.

It feels like anytime I have free time I slip into my depressive tendencies really quickly. I sleep all day. I’m sluggish and anxious. I eat like crap and stop exercising.
Because I have a few months off, I’ve been debating working some easy temp job for a bit before going on a vacation, but I only really have a month I could spend on working. Many of my friends have moved out of the area and I’m a bit shy, so I have a hard time meeting people despite the fact that I need at least some social interaction. 

I just don’t want to spend the next month finishing the project I have and the rest of my time in my room doing nothing. 

Most of the time, being a workaholic feels good. Often times I’ll actually overload my schedule in a way I shouldn’t. 

However, I also don’t know how to relax and it scares me. I’m incredibly burnt out and have promised myself and everyone around me that I’ll finally take a vacation. I have some money saved and am planning to go to abroad for a month or two, but I have some loose ends to tie up in the meantime.

Do y’all have any suggestions about how you’ve dealt with this?",26Mar2019,1
39,"I've considered seeing a therapist for awhile, since a lot of things in my life have just felt off for a year or so. Between getting divorced, getting deployed for 4 months, and then moving to the other side of the world within 6 months of each other, I probably should have done this a while ago. 

Being in the military, it is free, and I get time off work to go to the appointments, so there is literally no reason not to go. I guess I was just scared to hear what they say. But I've come to realize that no matter what I find out, I'm not myself, and haven't been for sometime. It is affecting (or effecting? can never tell) literally every part of my life. 

I've gained probably 40 Lbs,  relationships are suffering, I don't do anything socially on the weekends, I basically go to work and go home. And that just is not who I am! I am an incredibly outgoing person, I love meeting new people, doing new things, going new places. And I love making people laugh. 

That was the last thing to go. Even semi-recently I've still had my humor, but lately I don't even respond to conversation. 

I haven't even met with the doc yet and I already feel better. But I've also never done this, or needed it honestly. What do I need to know / do going in? What can I expect? 

Also, anyone with experience to share dealing with military mental health docs would be appreciated.",26Mar2019,1
40,"This is my first time posting to this sub after lurking for a long time and im doing it in a state of frustration and emotion so i apologize for any grammatical errors, spelling mistakes or the works.

Im having trouble understanding why i cant do anything right. My parents are always mad and disappointed with me. Im 20 and they micromanage my every move and monitor me with gps tracking and security cameras IN the house. I dont do drugs, I dont smoke, i dont drink, i dont party, i dont even really have friends, and definitely not a girlfriend. Im in school for aircraft maintenance engineering and have a gpa of 3.8 and work 2 jobs. I have a great reputation at both jobs and never had disciplinary issues at either. I also play on a hockey team and am committed to it. I do well in all aspects of my life and yet my parents never show me anything but disappointment. Of course they talk so my grandparents are too. My grandma and grandpa used to be the only people i could talk to until my mother told them things to sway their view point.

Admittedly im not perfect. Occasionally i will leave a pop can or something in my room or fall behind on laundry but its nothing too severe. Yet for whatever reason all my family does is try to drag me down. I go to class from 8-4 every day and work every evening of the week plus working 16 hours over the weekend and when i get home after a long day i just want to relax and have some quiet but every night my mom lectures me and bitches at me about how irresponsible i am and how i suck at being an ""Adult"".

The other day i was totally honest and told my parents how i feel and at this rate when im done school in april i will be moving out and not talking to anyone in my family ever again. My mom then put on the water works about how sad she was and how she only wants whats best for me. Ironically their behavior has been a contributing factor to past attempts to kill myself. I find myself slipping down that road once again and dont know what to do. 

I dont know if this is a cry for help, a rant, or just a need to be heard but i do know i NEEDED to get this shit off my chest. It has been digging a hole in me for the past few months and i just dont have anybody to talk to about things.

I want to enjoy my family but currently i find it hard to even love my own parents with how they treat me. I just dont feel like an individual with free will. I dont even know why i bother going on living every day.

Im sorry its rambly and pointless. If anyone has any idea to help my situation i would love to hear them.",26Mar2019,1

42,"This post is going to be very messy grammatically and I'm sorry in advance. Essentially, I'm in a very precarious situation with my roommate and I'd appreciate any help or advice. I'm going to try to provide as much information as possible without revealing too much about myself.

I'm currently a student and I live in a 4 bedroom apartment off campus apartment complex. This year, I had to live in an apartment with random roommates, and the first semester went ok. However, I noticed very quickly that one of my roommates had trouble cleaning up after herself, I'll call her roommate X. She quickly commandeered one of the bathrooms in the apartment and covered it in clutter and filth, and a few weeks into the semester, it was unusable, forcing myself and my other roommates, who I'll refer to as roommate Y and Z, to have to share the other bathroom in the apartment. The mess spread to the kitchen, which started with her leaving raw and rotten food sitting on the counter for weeks and later using the same pots and pans over and over again without washing them. Roommate Y and Z tried to nicely get her to clean, but she would either not fully comprehend what they were asking or forget. Last year I dealt with very messy roommates and vigilantly tried to get them to at least clean a little with no results, so I selfishly let roommate Y and Z take the reigns in trying to get roommate X to clean. At the end of last semester, Y got frustrated and broke her friendliness and lectured roommate X on her unwillingness to clean. It seemed like roommate X cleaned after Y's lecture and I thought that would be the end of it.

&amp;#x200B;

However, when we came back after winter break, things started to escalate very quickly. X started having severe mood swings. I'll give a few examples that best illustrate the situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-A few weeks into the semester, I was in the kitchen making food around 10:30pm, which was admittedly not something I should have been doing, but for some reason that night I was under the impression that X wasn't home. She came out of her room, which is very close to the kitchen, and sternly but reasonably asked me to not be in the kitchen because she was trying to sleep. I felt really bad for waking her up and apologized and she went back to her room. Around midnight, an hour and a half later, I was in my room watching some Netflix show I was very invested in with my headphones in, and I heard X scream from downstairs ""NEVER BE IN THE KITCHEN AT MIDNIGHT EVER AGAIN."" I immediately opened my door and looked downstairs but all the lights were off and no one was in the kitchen. Roommate Y and Z later confirmed that they heard X screaming but were in their rooms. A few minutes later, X knocked on my door and looked very agitated and shaken. She asked me to never be in the kitchen this late again in a somewhat neutral voice, but I could tell she was very angry and wanted to yell at me. I apologized and she went back to her room downstairs. 

\-About five days after this first incident, I came home to a note on the fridge that said ""DO NOT MOVE MY STUFF OR I WILL CALL THE POLICE."" I later learned that one of my roommates had moved her groceries next to X's groceries, which bothered her, though we never talked about dividing up the fridge. Myself and Y and Z talked about the note but could not figure out why X was so angry. A few days later, I saw X in our living room and we had a regular, pleasant conversation about the weather, and she seemed to be in a good mood. Ten minutes later however, I heard her angrily knocking on Y's door. I asked her what was wrong and she said she was upset about Y moving her food to her shelf in the fridge. I told her to talk to Y about it and she'd probably be fine with moving her food. A few hours later, I was in the kitchen and Y walked in the front door. X immediately stormed out of her room and started screaming, and I mean really screaming, at Y about the food in the fridge and other past grievances. After a brief and tense confrontation, Y went to her room, and I started talking to X extremely calmly. I was very scared of her at this moment and made sure to talk to her in a very calming and comforting way. She realized after a few minutes that she shouldn't have yelled at Y and apologized to her. We talked about X's standards for the kitchen and she seemed happy with what we agreed upon.

However, ever since this incident, X's mood swings have gotten worse. We went through every avenue that we could think of at our school to try to get help with the situation, and every office agreed that the situation was very bad but that they couldn't force X to talk to them unless she violated school conduct or committed a crime. We feel now that we are out of options. We may try to get out of our leases early but the complex we live in is owned by a large corporation that rarely allows this. As more incidents have occurred, a pattern seems to have emerged. X is rarely able to take accountability even if the facts are very clearly stated for her, such that she made a huge mess in the kitchen. She has extremely high standards for mostly roommate Y and Z, such as not making noise after a certain hour, but is often screaming on the phone at these same hours. She is very paranoid about us touching her stuff and if we declutter a part of the apartment that involves touching something she owns, even if we just relocate it to a corner, she gets really angry. However, I also noticed she exhibits extreme hostility towards Y, neutral hostility towards Z, and friendliness towards me. Sometimes I have walked in on X yelling at Z or Y and X has stopped yelling and acted like everything is normal, expressing friendliness towards me. She seems to really like me and hate Y and Z. I mentioned this to a friend who is a social worker, and she wondered whether X may be exhibiting signs of Borderline Personality Disorder. In NO way do either of us (myself and the social worker friend) feel that we have the ability to diagnose X with this, nor do either of us desire to make a diagnosis. However, I'm really really in the dark here. Myriad campus services seem unwilling or unable to help, and there's a possibility that I may have to live with X for two more months. Having some idea of what she may be suffering with may help me to plan my interactions with her. I am not asking anyone to confirm my suspicion of BPD, but if anyone has any idea of how I should go about interacting with her given the above, and what to do in the case that she splits with me, given her trust in me seems to be stopping much damage from incurring, that would be greatly appreciated. I would also greatly appreciate any suggestions on what to do with my own housing situation, given I cannot use half of my apartment in fear of my X's retaliation. I know asking strangers for advice over the internet is far from ideal, but I don't think I am going to get it from anyone else. Every professional I've reached out to seems just as confused on what to do, and do not seem to have expertise on a large swath of mental illnesses.",26Mar2019,1

I live in a smallish town (the closest towns/cities are about 40 minute to an hour drive away and we don't have any buses or trains that come through). And if I do somehow get the courage to seek help there is a chance that my parents could find out (someone that I know may see me going and tell my parents, etc) and I want to avoid having to be lectured by them.

48," I don't know why I'm writing this, maybe I'm hoping someone here has been through something similar or has some words of encouragement, but I'm just feeling really worn down and out of options. My wife and I have been married for a little over a year and she has severe depression, I suffer from it too, but not nearly to the same extent. I love her more than anything and all I want to do is help her, but on a weekly basis for the past long while it feels like I'm trying to talk her off a ledge and it's starting to wear me down too. She gets to the point where she tells me to leave because she's ""a worthless parasite and a horrible person."" I try over and over to tell her how much I love her and convince her that she has value and is a good person, but she thinks I'm lying or just doesn't believe me. She needs real therapy and probably medication, but with me in school and her working retail, we simply can't afford it. I only have a year left in grad school and I will be able to get a good job and support her after that so I've been trying to help her however I can until then, but I'm starting to think she won't make it that long and I don't know what to do. If I leave school to support her, she'll just feel even worse because she'll be keeping me from my dream, but if I don't I'm honestly terrified that either she'll leave or attempt suicide. When I'm around her I can usually help calm her down, but she often gets like this at work where I can't do anything. I want to get her out of customer service because she's always had a hard time dealing with angry and unreasonable customers, but neither of us know how to get out of that sinkhole and into a new field without higher education or experience.

51,"First of all, I know that Reddit is not a good place to diagnose myself from, but I don’t have money for a therapist, and many people in this community are very knowledgable in this topic. 

I’ve been recently having episodes that I am not sure are panic attacks are not. I’ll give one example, where I remember my symptoms best. 

I was in a rehearsal, talking to my friend (I don’t want to get into it but the topic was something I was very insecure about) and I had a small audition later in the rehearsal, but I didn’t know when. I began to feel so insecure from the conversation that I had the overwhelming feeling that I needed to get out of that room. I could feel pressure rising in my chest, like I was about to start sobbing. I started sweating and fidgeting, with an extreme urge to snap my hairband on my wrist, something I always do when I’m frustrated. All I could think was, “I need to get out of here, I need to get out of here.” I mumbled to my friend that I was going to get water and I ran to the bathroom. 

I sat in a stall, my breath coming in short gasps. I felt like I was about to cry, but I didn’t let myself, because I knew I needed to go back to rehearsal. I sat in the stall for about a minute, until I got my breathing regular. Then I composed myself and walked back to the room. With my luck, my audition was just about to begin. Needless to say, I did awful. It was bad enough that singing in front of people is an insecurity of mine, I had to do it right after a breakdown. I didn’t get the part.

Right after the rehearsal finished, I ran to the bathroom again and cried. Partially because I was embarrassed and disappointed by my performance, but mostly because I didn’t get to cry before. I was miserable for the rest of the day. 

Another big trigger of mine is when I’m in a place that’s very loud, crowded, or disorganized, especially when I’m trying to focus.

52,"  

I’m getting this one intrusive thought that is completely harmless and doesn’t impact my behaviour but is relentlessly bugging me nonetheless. It’s about what this one person, who is of no real value to me, thinks of me. Because the idea that I’m concerned with what this irrelevant person’s opinion of me annoys me, my brain then repeats it over and over until this thought won’t leave my brain. It's sort of transformed now that its not really about this persons opinion anymore but now just that name just jabbing at me. My brain is finding creative ways of allowing this thought and the person to pop into times where I’m feeling happy (i.e. it’s attached itself particularly to when I’m admiring beautiful scenery for instance) and hits me incessantly when I’m hungover or tired. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know what’s happening (the more you fuel it the worse it gets) but it’s hard for me to get rid of it. I’ve been taking an anxiety meditation course because I thought that would be the most relevant, but I feel like it’s not specific to my situation. I’m not really that anxious, and am living a relatively happy life it’s just this constant light jab in the head of this person’s name that’s really getting a rise out of me. It makes me worried that when if I was to go travelling overseas look out at a nice view it’s just gonna jab jab jab, or even when I’m an old man with kids its gonna coming poking in. I’ve read a bunch of things on intrusive thoughts and how to deal with them, but if anyone could put me onto some sort of specific course or therapy that helps out with **harmless** yet bothersome intrusive thoughts and how to manage them to the point where they go away or aren’t worth any value that they might aswell be gone.

When I was a kid I thought about torturing children around my own age, it was obsessive when I was a child but now I only think about it once every few months. I would think about it all day long and it would make me happy to think of them getting hurt, in particular this one kid at my school. It originally started when I was 8 years old from this one time my friend pranked this kid, he put a carrot under a rag and stuck a pin into it pretending it was his finger, the kid started the cry and looked so scared, this excited me and from then on I thought of all the ways I could torture him. I still think about him to this day.

I was abused by my father during that time period (8-14) and im sure this factored into it. At a age of 10 whenever I walked on the footpath my OCD would try to make me run out onto the road, I did this alot just before cars were coming trying to kill myself in a sense, but I didnt know what was happening. I've suffered with depression my whole life. Sometimes I would see a kid and would get these thoughts of me torturing and killing them and that would make me so happy.

I've never killed or hurt anyone in that way, I have only killed 2 mice from my sick desires in my whole life. I dont plan on ever doing that to anyone.

Long, nonsensical ramblings about how everyone who has wronged him is part of the FBI and they are all trying to put him in jail.

62,"The past 6 years have been hard for me, the last 3 really painful. It has left me with a crazy amount of depression, anxiety, worry, trust issues, and my cutting urges has become almost a relapse more then 3 times the past 2 or 3 months, and I have abandonment issues from a young age, just some you can understand my mental state. 

My dad passed away in '16, I haven't really been able to process it since I was in a very emotionally and mentally abusive relationship then and for the year after that, and I have recently discovered my mom has been a pathological liar or something like it for not just the past 4 or 5 years, but pretty much my whole life. 

Which has made me look back and not only see things in a new light (and have it make more since), but also realize... I dont really remember a whole lot from anything under 12 (when I started cutting). I told my therapist this since we have been focusing on my moms lying and how it is affecting my life,  and getting me out of this ""life"" and into my own life, where I can process all the trama I have been in and also grow and build my life.

She asked me some questions revolving my elementary school since that is were I was a lot of the time. If i rememberd my teachers, friends, games I would play, subjects i liked, and favorite foods... I remember most of them of not all, but then she started asking me favorite toys I played with at home, favorite games I would play, shows I would watch, what I would do for relaxation and fun... I can not remember any of those until about 12... at all... I have a few memories, but they are quick and fuzzy, and 60% not at home. 

And I have been going through not wanting to be touched lately. When I am upset I am use to not wanting to be touched, that's been me as long as I can remember, and even though I have been extremely more upset lately, I dont want to be touched even when I'm happy. I loved hugs, I loved just holding somebody's hand just cuz... but I have to pretty much force myself to now since my family is so use to it from me, but it makes my skin crawl. And just thinking about it... like now... its gross. I hate it. 

I dont know if it's just from me going through so much, and me being more uspset, that its carrying over to even when I'm not upset, or if something did happen to me, and now that I am questioning it, that this is a manifestation of trama i have blanked out. I'll be talking to my therapist about this, but i want some other input on it as well.

TL;DR: I have had some pretty traumatic stuff happen the past 6 years, now questioning if I blocked something from my childhood out, and if as a result of my questioning if that is real, or if it just a sidaffect to the trama I have more recently gone through, that I (a once affectionate peroson) now hate being touched, or even the idea of being touched.

65,"I don’t intend to offend anyone with anything I say, so I’m hoping nothing I bring up is out of hand. 

Let me give y’all a little background information: I’m a 19 year old female. I live with my mom and stepdad, and I’m not currently doing much of anything with my life. I graduated high school in May of 2017, and I took a little break until January of 2018 when I started the process of trying to enlist in the Air Force. That was my dream. 

It didn’t work out. I got a kidney stone two weeks before I was supposed to ship off to basic training in March of 2018. They told me I couldn’t leave with a pre-existing medical condition, and I’ve had it ever since. (The doctor considered it an elective surgery since it wasn’t causing me any harm. If I want it gone, I have to pay for it out of pocket.)

I tried to wait it out, and I tried everything I could think of to get rid of that little 3 mm life-ruiner. I stayed in touch with my recruiter, and I drank absolutely nothing but water for months. (Unless you count the times that I drank pomegranate juice, beer, lemon juice, etc -stuff that is supposed to make you pee to help flush out your kidneys.)

I didn’t have a back-up plan, and I didn’t want a back-up plan tbh. I had my mind set on one goal, and I didn’t wanna settle for anything else. 

I managed to get a job at the Dairy Queen here in May of 2018 to try to pass a little more time. 
Dairy Queen was miserable. Customers were rude, and the “management” was trash. The pay was definitely not worth it. To anybody on here who works/has worked in the fast food industry, I applaud you. I did it for 8 months, and I was unhappy the entire time. 

I put in my two weeks in January of this year, thinking it wouldn’t be very difficult to find a new job. 

I was absolutely wrong. 

I’ve applied to so many different places. I’ve been to at least four interviews. I should’ve listened when people told me to find a new job before I quit Dairy Queen, but I hated that place so much that a part of me doesn’t regret it. My only good decision in that situation though was that I had a bit of money saved up. About 1200, and that’s what I’ve been using to pay for my subscriptions, gas, hygiene items, and phone bill the last couple months, so I’m down to only a couple hundred now. I HAVE to find a new job. And soon. 

Coming back to what this post was originally meant for, I’ve always struggled with mental health. 

During my sophomore and junior years of high school, I struggled with anxiety issues. Pretty severely. I couldn’t walk through crowded areas alone. I had panic attacks all the time. They’d cause me to run out of my classrooms in tears for no apparent reason and hide in bathroom stalls. And they were constant. I couldn’t give presentations without freaking out. I stopped caring about my grades. I couldn’t eat lunch in the cafeteria. I couldn’t sleep. It was awful. 

I brought it up to the pediatrician I was still seeing at the time. Of course, my mom was with me, and she was 100% against me taking any sort of actual medication, and the only “mental health” person she wanted to allow me to see was with a religious affiliation. He preached at the church we went to, and I wasn’t comfortable talking to him because I didn’t feel like it would be confidential. 

The pediatrician diagnosed me with Panic Disorder and General Anxiety Disorder, but he agreed with my mom. He told her to pick me up some Melatonin to take, and he blamed my anxiety completely on a lack of sleep. 

I knew it wouldn’t help, and I told my mom that, but she wouldn’t consider letting me do anything that she didn’t want done. Her solution was to buy me an “herbal” sort of medication. L-Theanine. 

It didn’t do much of anything. I just sort of learned to push the anxiety back. It was always there though. At the edge of my mind. 

I pretty much had it all under control by my senior year of high school. The random panic attacks stopped. I still got anxious over stuff, but it wasn’t anything severe. 

Then I started dating a guy who completely messed me up. It was somebody I’d been chasing after since my freshman year when he was a senior. 

He was emotionally abusive. Manipulative. 

He told me I was pathetic and that I’d never amount to anything. He told me I wasn’t a good person and that nobody would want me after he was done with me because he had ruined me for everyone else. He told me I was self-centered and that I made him want to kill himself. He constantly called me a f*cking dumb*ss and a god*mn cunt and a stupid b*tch and the list goes on. He blame shifted and gaslighted- you name it, he did it. 

And, in his eyes, all of it was my fault.

The guy would cut himself and blame it on me. He would ignore me for days at a time- no texts, no calls, nothing- then he’d get upset when I got upset. He would get drunk. He would yell at me.

He was a sick man. All of the things he told me he wanted to do to me- chain me up to his ceiling, tie me up in his closet and leave me there for days, carve his name into my skin, cut me, burn me, hit me, KILL me, etc. He talked about watching the life drain from my eyes. 

He liked to see me crying when we were having sex. He would tell me how worthless I was while he was f*cking me, and he’d wrap his hands around my throat to the point that I’d see black. He would hit me so hard that my ears would ring, and he would make me bleed during sex because I was raw, and he wouldn’t listen when I asked him to stop. 

I’m into BDSM too, but he didn’t want just some pleasurable pain. He was an actual sadist, and he got off on GENUINELY hurting me. 

But I was trapped, you know?

Not physically. But mentally. I was reliant on him. Extremely co-dependent. I couldn’t make a decision without him. Not talking to him for more than a couple hours would send me into a full-blown panic attack. My chest was always hurting. I was paranoid. I distanced myself from everyone else. My life was not my own. That’s what happens in abusive relationships. 

Over a year later, it all came to an end. 

He tossed me aside without a second thought, and I was devastated. 

I laid in bed for days, refused to eat, and cried until I had nothing left. By then, I was empty, and I didn’t have any clue who I was anymore. 

Eventually, I adjusted to life without him. After five years of being obsessed with him, that was hard. There were times when I could feel him. If that makes any sense. I remember I was standing in the shower one day when, all of a sudden, I just felt like he was behind me, and all I could think about was this time that he pinned me against a hotel shower’s wall by my throat and just stared into my eyes with this insane look until his grip was squeezing so hard that I actually couldn’t breathe and my vision was dotted with black. Then he just let me go and left the bathroom. And, after that memory, I curled up in a ball on the floor of my shower and rocked myself back and forth while I cried. 

Sometimes the awful stuff he used to say to me just repeats itself in my head. Over and over again. Mostly when I’m really upset. 

I’m not the same person I used to be. Not at all. 

Half the time, I feel like I’m two different people. Maybe more. I see stuff in so many different ways. You can ask me what I think about something, and I can’t ever give a direct or distinct answer because I don’t have one. I have multiple answers, some of which contradict others. 

I have moments when I get really depressed and overwhelmed and all I can can think about is “what am I going to do now” “how do I even start the process of college” “it isn’t worth it” “idk where to begin” “I can’t even find a job”  “this ain’t what I want to do” and it sends me down into a spiral where I have so much going through my head that I can’t focus on one thing, and I just don’t even want to be alive. 

Not to say I’m suicidal because ten minutes later, I’ll be almost euphoric.  

I’ll go from not texting anyone. Avoiding leaving the house because I can’t stand to leave my dog because it makes me feel guilty. Not wanting social interaction. Being so tired I don’t want to move. Having absolutely no motivation..

To having so much energy that I feel like I am about to implode because there’s no where to burn it. I’ll text multiple people at a time, and I’ll start thinking about working out and going skydiving, and I’ll be so happy that I just feel a little crazy. 

Then something small will happen and I’ll crash back down into an even deeper depression. 

All I can think during those moments is that I’m falling behind everyone that I went to high school with. All I can think is that I’ve failed at everything I’ve tried to do so far. I feel useless. Pathetic. Frustrated. Confused. Angry. Desperate. 

I know it’s not hopeless and I know I’m only 19 and I know that I have my whole life ahead of me. Nobody had to tell me that. A part of me already knows it. 

I just can’t control it. 

My mom accused me of having manic depression. 

My friends just call the mood swings weird through text and go with the flow. I try not to ever let it affect them in person. 

It’s like this all the time. 

But the depression is getting worse. 

Idk what’s wrong with me, and I think I need to start seeing a professional, but we live in a small town, and I don’t have health insurance or a job, and I don’t want my mom involved. Her solutions are always the same.

That’s not where I’ve ended up though, actually pretty far from it, nearly on the other end of the scales. When I left school, I lost all my friends, it was just one of those growing up phases. I accepted that because I always thought I’d get more, so why worry about it, eh? I haven’t had any real friends since school, not people I can connect with and truly bond with. I became addicted to drink and drugs. I did try to make something of myself by going to college but I dropped out, which is not a big deal because I was only doing the class for the sake of it. I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder 4 years ago, which makes sense because all the symptoms do fit with me, even though they’d probably fit almost everyone. I’m 33 now, living at my parents with my fiancé. We absolutely hate it. We get no privacy. I feel it’s all my fault because I can only work part time. I get really stressed with work and I only work in a retail shop! I fractured my ankle a year and a half ago, so now I can’t walk properly as I had metal plates fitted after two surgeries. As I’m getting older, I’m really lonely. I think about the bonds I could of made with some male friends, almost having a brotherhood, just like you see in the movies. Life is strange.

Not even like telling them (my family) would help, they'd just consider me psychotic and they are probably right for all I know. I'm 18 and have no sense on what the fuck the universe wants from me, and thinking about it, seems like the universe fucked up when they made me ( I know that's not how I'm ""made"" just fuck off) because I don't think it knows what it wants from me, and all I get from people trying to help is how they went through ""rough patches"" and just got to tough it out. I'm done ""toughing"" it out, life shouldn't be toughing it out. I look around in my family and since I'm the youngest I've seen all the ridiculous shit that has happened to them all and it's fucked, And I post this in this area because this isn't the first time I have felt like this, I have tried to take my life before, and couldn't do it.

It's so fucked too because whenever I was around ""friends"" I would just put on this macho toughness guy like nothing hurt me and I just kept everything bottled up, and there shouldn't be anything in my life that I should complain about because I had the option to make it better but what good would come of it.

Most people would probably never know the nature of the things I think about - how dark and deep it can get. On the outside I am a functional member of society, generally attractive and articulate. I get by in life.

But I feel like I don’t belong. Everyone seems to play by a different rule book and I truly don’t understand. Social ostracism is such a devastating thing and I feel like the way I am just naturally pushes people away.

I have a big heart, I love so deeply, I’m a big thinker. I have a lot of flaws, but doesn’t everyone? Why are mine so unforgivable? Don’t I deserve to be loved and tended to like anyone else?

Whenever there’s been a problem in my life, my mum would even turn it around to be about her, what she’s experienced, tell me I’m being ungrateful or tell me that in her day she had it a lot worse. My parents have never encouraged me or my brothers to better ourselves, they even told us as kids there’s no point doing homework because we’ll be working when we leave school, they literally think life is about staying in the same position until you die. For example, my older brother has recently had a mental breakdown and been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. When he told my mum, she said that she hopes he doesn’t leave his current job because it’s a job and it will take a long time to find one. She also mentions the fact he got fired from his last job for stealing money. Stealing is 100% wrong but he was young and he got fired from that job just over 7 years now! Why on earth would someone still want their son to work in a job that makes them completely miserable and why would someone talk about a job that their son got fired from, 7 years ago?! The job is a crap job. How do I know? I work for the same company! I’m also looking for another job but my mum says I shouldn’t leave because it’s a job and we all have to work. When you tell her it makes you depressed as well as suicidal, she just says everyone’s jobs makes them like that and then goes on to talk about her job. I understand that it’s life and not all people will love their job but I refuse to be stuck in a place that makes me want to kill myself. Life is for living, not wasting away at some hell hole. She says her brothers and sisters are not worth talking to because they’re all trouble makers who cause problems, they all think they’re better than everyone but it’s her who’s the problem. Not them.

77,"So I know we’ve all come across a lot of posts like this before, but it’s a burden I carry everyday, I need abit of advice because I don’t know what else to do, this might be abit of a read and I’m sorry but I need to just communicate it probably to explain my situation. 

when I had my first relationship,  I was young dumb and in love, but it was an abusive relationship and I didn’t know anything else, i was cheated on, used for a place to stay, they stole from me, gaslighted me, and isolated me to the point that when I did speak out they physically hurt me to keep me quiet. After 12-24  months of this going on I finally got out, but I carried a fear of abandonment with me. 
In the period of 4 years after this, I didn’t view relationships as something serious anymore, and majority of each new relationship I had only lasted a few weeks at most, after this time I just gave up on having any form of romantic connection and just focused on the physical side, emotionally disconnecting myself from the other person, as if it was a game.

After this period I stayed solo for 3 years during which I went through depression and I found myself drowning out the feelings with drugs each day.  I ended up getting into financial problems and had to move in with my parents, after a year of trying to get sober and trying to fix my life I ended up meeting someone. 

After the first time I met them, I couldn’t stop thinking about them, I was scared each time I got a text from them, and I felt like I was not enough for them to love, but they where kind, and liked me as the person I was. each day I woke up thinking about them, and each night I stayed awake scheming on how to make them mine, after a few weeks they asked me to be their partner. Around 4 months of my life being perfect I was introduced to their ex partner at a social gathering, the ex was incredibly beautiful, and charismatic and I felt like I was nothing, I started worrying about my relationship and I got frustrated majority of the day and I was so angry at myself but I blamed my parter for everything, after weeks of me being insecure and pushing them away, blaming them and putting them down each day -as if they where nothing, i gradually got worse as time went on.

I eventuality found out that they cheated on me, and at that moment it was as if something inside of me snapped and said “see your just not good enough”, I broke up with them but I couldn’t let them go, I started stalking them online and followed them around when I knew where they would be, granted they where dealing with my behaviour very well, but now each day that passed I was just becoming more obsessed with them and with the idea that things would be good again. each time I spent with them after this I found myself continuously blaming them over and over again, and treating them bad. 
They ended up moving states and I ended up moving to another city, after 4 years, and random communication with them here and their, I can confidentiality say that each day that passed I thought of them and all the things that I did to them, and after all of this thought process I would punished myself in my mind for everything I did. I am ashamed of myself because of this. They ended up getting a new partner and I am happy for them, because it would just be selfish of me to want anything less for them, but now here I am, 4 years later, and I still think of them each and everyday, I am in love with them, and I can’t forgive myself for what I did, I feel like I pushed away the only sunlight I had and now I’m stuck in the darkness again. 
I apologise to them many times and explained how truly sorry I am and they forgave me, but I just can’t forgive myself, I love them and they are my world, and todays just another normal day of this thought process for me. 

I need to know how to let this go because it’s a burden on my heart, I feel ashamed and I can’t forgive myself for what I’ve done. I know this sounds stupid and childish but Its something I carry with me each day. I need advice to move on but this is something that I can’t just let it go.

I’m humming a tune in my head, then I’m thinking about a piece of work I did a week ago and how I can improve it. It feels more like I’m talking to myself in my head most of the time, like I’m commentating on things as they happen but with some random thoughts thrown in. For example, it’s quite frustrating watching a film because I’m creating sub plots and character origin stories in my head as it rolls by. I can follow the plot, but I can never just enjoy what’s presented in front of me at face value. The only time I really feel like it’s not a problem is when I’m playing video games. This is a time when constantly thinking in a competitive shooter where strategy is important really helps me out.

I'm not religious or addicted to any alcohol or drugs(although I do drink and smoke weed occasionally) so i wouldnt want something like AA. Just want somewhere to meet like-minded people where we can all talk and share etc.

Does anything exist that is just general support? Or are they very specific to 1 issue? If so, anyone have any idea where I might fit? 

Thanks in advance",26Mar2019,6
82,"Hi, I am kind of confused about the way I am feeling and how to get better, so I am writing here to try and understand my thoughts and hopefully receive some advice or gain insights which I am unable to see. Thank you for reading, I appreciate it.

I was always a very happy person, and I think I still am deep inside, but something changed some years ago, but it is almost like I can't really pinpoint why I still feel the way I feel. - My life situation is not bad, probably easy compared to how other people have to go through life - I live in a European capital, I work (since 1 month) part time in a restaurant, I sometimes do some online teaching, I have a studio where I am painting, I graduated with a Masters from a good university, I have loving parents. Yet a part of me feels like: is this it? I feel like I was very interested in art and in doing coursework when I was at university, because I had a structure and I felt like I was going on this journey together with others. I had this feeling that new things and new discoveries were just around the corner, and I never had the feeling that I could predict what would happen in my life (a good feeling.) Then I got together with a guy in my last year at university who triggered in me a lot of insecurities and I became kind go angry at him, at life, at myself - I felt like I was not good enough as I was, I wanted to be like him (I know it sounds silly, but I genuinely believe I wanted to become him, as he was very social, outgoing, and everybody like him so much, I became jealous of the skills he had, and I even was angry that my past was not similar to his, and that people didn't act towards me exactly the way they did towards him) - I kind of distanced myself a bit from the people I used to hang out with at university, and it was like I became part of this bubble which was just me and him, and my anger and jealousy and my attempt to become him...then we graduated and we moved to home city, a different European capital, where I started receiving unemployment money, and he was looking for a job. I didn't realise it at the time, but here I started to isolate myself, didn't really see people and spent long days depressed, but I was fully functioning, going to internships and reading and listening to music, watching things and sometimes seeing my family - basically I didn't really realise I was depressed. Of course my relationship didn't go that well and he moved back to London and came to see me some weekends, but I think it was easier for him to not be so much around me, as I was always angry and irritated at him. After a year of this, of not really talking to anyone about how I felt, but spending many days feeling sad, but still fully functioning, I moved to Berlin, where I think things got a bit better, I slowly started to make friends, and my boyfriend also joined me, but after 1 year me and him split up, and I have been here 2 years now since we broke up. After we broke up I started developing a kind of social anxiety, because without him, it was like I couldn't hide behind him, and I started spending more time alone with other people, and it was becoming difficult to hide how I was feeling. Then I went to therapy for some months and I feel like I understood more what happened and I felt better, but now, even now, I still feel insecure when I talk to people and I cannot fully enjoy my time in the company of other people - I feel like I overcompensate when I am in the company of others, I smile too much because my face naturally droops down, and even though I have told a lot of people how I am feeling- confused about why I feel the way I feel, confused about why my face looks sad all the time - I still feel like I cannot be comfortable in myself. When I am alone, it is ok, but it is together with others that I feel 'different'. When people ask me if I like living in Berlin, in my head I do not think super positive, I feel a bit sad, like something is missing for me living in this city, and my answer always seems to come out 'yeah, it's a cheap city, I can afford to have free time here which I couldn't in London' and even if I am going to classes and learning about new things that interest me, it is like they don't mean so much, paradoxically - I don't know, I basically still feel a little bit like life has disappointed me, and sometimes I feel a bit of an anger about how my life turned out, and what happened in the past - I have spoken to another psychologist about this, but it doesn't seem to be something I am resolving - I basically just feel like I wish I could just feel better, and retort to my old, happy self - I feel really terrible when I think about how I cannot be joyful around people, and it really affects how I interact with others, and it leaves me feeling bad about myself - I am searching for something which can break this whole circle of circumstances? A part of me feels like life used to appear exciting and free and limitless, and now it seems a bit more mundane, like time is falling through my hands...well I find it hard to explain, and I sometimes don't really know what action I should take? I am working, I take music classes, I paint and I even have exhibitions - but somehow it doesn't make me amazingly happy, not the kind of happiness I took for granted and just was part of me when I was at university, when I felt like my life had a course, had things to follow and direction - I don't know, it just seemed easier.

Ok I think this is confusing enough, I really appreciate the time to read all of this, and I would be very grateful if anyone could share some of their thoughts, thanks a million x.

TLDR, I do not know why my joy is not how it used to be, I am searching for ways to get it back",26Mar2019,1
83,"Well good morning everyone today is day 2 of me trying to get my life back on track. Talked to the girlfriend last night with out me twisting every word she says to make her look like the bad guy. It was good a step in the right direction that's for sure, sadly she doesn't want to even be in the house with me or sleep in the same bed as me so I took the couch last night to give her space... Sadly I have made this place toxic. 

I took to writing last night everything that I'm feeling I type it up it's tough  hard to understand because it really makes no sense at all as I typed it as it came to me. I called the suicide help line last night got some information and we'll just needed someone to talk to as I feel like I'm in the fight of my life alone. It's hard 

If I could say one thing to the people I love it's that I'm trying  not only for me but for you as well, I'm sorry that I let my depression blind me from  the help that you were trying to give, I'm sorry that I snapped at all of you and called you names hurt you treated you like absolute trash  while I sat in my own head and wondered why you hate me. But now I get it you never hated me you just ran out of gass, and for that I'm sorry.

I'm trying to take life one day at a time now  last night I bumped my antidepressants up to 10mg in hopes that things will get better. My goal today Is to go out side go to the gym and talk to someone Random try and make that connection. I could ramble on for days but I think for today I'm going to end it here. Thanks for listening.

84,"Recently, I decided to get help to treat my PTSD from a long term relationship that was both physically and emotionally abusive. I've been seeing a therapist, and it's been helping with the physical symptoms like panic attacks, but I'm still getting rotations of over analyzing anxiety that leads to bitter depression. Deep down, I still feel like I'm a terrible person not worth love and so I tend to react with overwhelming sadness, numbness, or anger if I don't emotionally brace. I have a group of people that I'm close with that I love, yet I feel like I want to push them away because I've known them too long and that they're going to end up hurting me, which is not true.

I have changed my hair colour in the past within a week of deciding but then I kind of regret it because the bleach ruined my hair or it grew it and didn't match my root properly. I have to ban myself from going to the shops or else I'll go on a spending spree. I don't know if it's just  me being impulsive and shopping or what.

89,"For the past year or so I occasionally wake myself and my wife up in the middle of the night screaming ""stupid fucking bitch."" Usually it happens during or after a dream in which she did something mean like cheated on me or really any other random thing. It's very odd.

We have a good relationship and got married recently, and she never makes me angry like that while I'm awake. I just don't understand why 80% of my dreams involve being angry at her.

A few times I've woken up punching in random directions in my sleep. I've also kicked the hell out of her leg in the middle of the night once in one of my sleeping outbursts. Occasionally it's not my wife and I'll just be fighting some muggers or killers in my dream. My wife is pretty calm about the whole thing and usually tells me while laughing that I was insulting her again last night. I usually blow it off like I don't care but I'm honestly getting kind of concerned I'm going to punch my wife in the face in the middle of the night on accident. In my dreams, I am so angry it's unbelievable. I'll wake up sweating with my heart racing. Feeling all the physiological symptoms of actually being angry as hell. And it usually takes me a few minutes after waking up to realize I'm actually just angry about a fictional dream scenario.

I don't really have issues sleeping, in fact I usually sleep like a rock and can easily sleep for up to 14 hours at a time if I'm not disturbed.

What is this I'm experiencing? Is there a term for this? Is this common? Any tips on stopping it from happening or protecting my wife from angry sleeping me? I have a rocky past of being screwed over by people, maybe some sort of PTSD that manifests itself in my dreams? I have no idea. I have anxiety and panic attack issues if that could be related in anyway.",26Mar2019,2
90,"Hi, I've been suffering from anxiety, depression, and a borderline eating disorder for about two years now. I also think I may have a personality disorder but that's wild guessing and I definitely would never diagnose myself. I've been to the doctor (NHS) twice when things have got bad, tried the CBT service they referred me to, and the eating disorder service. Both of those I've 'dropped out of' as I don't think it was helping and had a fairly negative experience with the CBT. I was also put on 30mg of Prozac, but I struggled to stay on it and stopped and started a couple of times. That was last year.

I'm finally trying to improve myself but I feel like I've exhausted my options. I feel like I can't go back to the NHS because I've already messes them around and I'm not sure what else they could do, but I'm not sure where else to go.

93,"I've been dealing with depression for 6+ years now. It has in turned shaped my personality, very much so because I started developing it at a very young age. However, I wouldn't consider myself depressed anymore. I'm 19 now, and I've been wondering about something for a long time now.

These past 3 years I've noticed that I've stopped caring about anything, cliché I know. But I also feel as if though I'm apathetic all of the time, I cannot express feelings anymore. During my time in school, everyone thought I was emotionless and cold. I never showed any emotion or care about anything. I react indifferently to *everything*, as horrible as it sounds I feel as if though I wouldn't even care if someone close to me would die.

I still live with my parents so there’s really not much I can do. 

What I want to know is that how can I see a psychiatrist without my parents knowing?

103,"Based on some advice on a recent post I feel like I need to type this out.

I feel so sad all the time, but I have zero reason to.

I’m 30 years old. I have a beautiful, kind, caring wife, a dog, parents that care about me. We own a house with lots of equity and have a really good start on our retirement investing. Outside of our mortgage we have no debt. I own a business which is successful and has a good reputation in the community. 

But I have constant anxiety and stress. I can’t remember the last time I was truly happy. I think it was probably my wedding day which was years ago. 

I feel like a lot of my stress comes from running a business. Lately I have been working 10-12 hour days and working on weekends. Never feeling caught up. Never feeling like I’m doing enough. If I lose a customer I feel like a failure, like I’m going to lose everything. I think too much of my self worth is tied up in the business so I have tried to take up some other hobbies. This hasn’t helped yet.

I also realized that I was drinking around 1/2 - 1 bottles of wine every night and hiding this from my wife.I thought this might be contributing to this awful feeling of anxiety and sadness, so 10 days ago I quit drinking. I physically feel better but emotionally I feel the same.

I feel like such a piece of shit to even think about complaining about my life. There is literally nothing bad happening, but I can’t help feeling trapped. 

I fantasize about my wife and I leaving everything to be beach bums somewhere. Getting away from the everyday grind, but I have a feeling that I would still be trapped in this poisoned mindset. That I would simply let other smaller stresses fill my mind like air fills a room.

I spend everyday looking forward to the 2 hours I have from 9-11pm where I can just watch a Netflix show or sports and forget about the next day for a little while. This doesn’t seem like a very healthy way to live.

I feel like I should apologize for even posting this. It’s seems pathetic that I should complain about such minor problems. There are so many people that have it so much worse. I just had to type this out because I feel to embarrassed to share it with people in real life.

105,"  I'm a simple man. I can tell you what the underside of an office chair tastes like and anything posh and expensive leaves me confused. Put me in a board room and I'll be staring blankly at the biscuits or drawing a sketch of the chairperson's ears.  

  
I grew up painfully shy. As a teenager, other blokes were going to parties and getting laid, I was writing songs in my parents shed. You never really shake that shyness off completely- especially in situations like corporate meetings. You feel like a fraud, like any minute they'll realise they have Forrest Gump eating their custard creams and contributing nothing to their business. I'm sure this will ring a bell as 'imposter syndrome', the feeling that you don't deserve to be where you are.  
I wrote the song 'You Been Down Here' about how it's 'safe' to be in the dark place. It's safe being sad, shy, anxious and introverted. No one expects anything of you, and you have the blackness for comfort. Those disembodied voices telling you that you aren't worthy of something are like the manipulating friend you once had. They offer so much and give so little, but they are there for you all the same. You are surrounded by them in the warm but bleak isolation.  
Our Western cultural model clearly isn't helping people feel less anxious. It doesn't promote human connection and inward confidence- it promotes social-media narcissism and empty surface level pleasure at convenience. Social anxieties like 'imposter syndrome' are surely going to be more prevalent when the only goal and obsession of social media is to be 'liked' or 'favourited'- as a tick box is to a popularity form. I know people that literally bare their soul (and other things) on Facebook. Imagine what it does to a person internally if they admit their deep insecurities and reveal their hopes and dreams to everyone they know online and don't get any 'likes' or validation, whilst the same audience seemingly can't get enough of the next person, who's posted a video of themselves dancing with their cock out on the Khao San Road.          
I'm sure everyone has their own way of shaking this feeling off. I try to take the nihilistic approach by taking the perspective that everything in that boardroom (and beyond) will all turn to dust eventually in the ashes of time, and our tiny solar system, on the arm of a colossal but unremarkable galaxy, shooting through the utter ambivalence of an eternal void means that whatever bollocks being uttered in the meeting that day holds very little consequence, and that me being shy and feeling unworthy is a little silly in the grand scheme of things. I hope this helps someone else in the tiniest way.

107,"Narcissistic personality disorder is a horrible, painful condition. It's a mental disorder that, just like any, ruins the lives of people who never wanted to be this way. Like other personality disorders it takes away someone's control over their own thoughts and behaviours and twists their perceptions of the world around them. They've quite often been through abuse which has led them to develop their condition, and often they aren't even able to see that there's anything wrong - just like in other psych conditions.

Sociopathy hasn't even been considered a real diagnosis for decades. The closest thing is antisocial personality disorder, which is another horrible condition that people are forced to live with. It damages someone's ability to empathise and feel positive emotions, their ability to control strong bursts of anger or sadness and to properly deal with their emotions, and it makes people struggle to control impulsive behaviour and fit in with society. Someone with ASPD isn't the stoic, emotionless killer from a horror film or the cool, charismatic, cunning CEO. In fact they're very often poor and not too clever, having grown up in toxic environments and never getting the support they need to develop properly.

Both of these conditions are extremely complex and very, very hard to identify and diagnose, even for an experienced psychiatrist sitting across from their patient.

Reddit uses these terms the way people used ""retarded"" a decade ago. People have taken crippling conditions that they know fuck all about beyond watching slasher films and Dr Phil, and turned them into slurs.

It's even worse just how readily people make these armchair diagnoses. Whenever anyone does something bad, they must be a *sociopath!* It couldn't just be that normal people like you and me sometimes do bad things for a variety of very complex reasons - no, they must be a sociopath (and that means monster!)

Whenever a /r/relationship_advice or /r/amitheasshole post describes someone doing something that could even just be interpreted as slightly unreasonable, or a slight overreaction, they're a TOXIC NARCISSIST! No, they didn't just snap because they've been under a lot of stress like any human can, they dont just seem unreasonable because we don't know what's going on in their head and know their side of the story. No, they're a NARCISSIST! And it seems *everyone* on Reddit knows at least one narcissist, usually more.


And how do you deal with someone who has a debilitating mental health condition? You cut them out of your life completely! After all, they're toxic and they'll ruin your life if you let them!

But around a few years ago at Christmas my  sister told us she was molested by the man who was my dad's best man at his wedding (so a pretty close family friend) this happened when she was 4 or 5 so, nothing happened when we contacted police, case fell through on lack of evidence which we did expect, but since this day, it has tore my family apart. 

My mum has always suffered from depression and bi-polar disorder, she drinks...a lot

And my mum along with my sister is the worst effected by it

But for me, seeing my mum self destruct and drink herself to death is killing me too

And last year I saved my friend from killing himself, he went through the same thing as my sister, but his family weren't supportive like mine would be with my sister, they're old fashioned, they tell him to go to work because it's when he's at home he has time to think about it and he should get on with it, shit like that

So, I got off work (worked in a bar at the time) @1am
Travelled to my friends cousin's house where we were supposed to meet. Just me and friends cousin, had a feeling something was wrong so I tried calling. I got a text from him and instantly started running, ended up 2 miles away, my phone had died by this point and all the info I had gotten from him was the name of the park he was at (big ass park) and that he had taken a lot of prescription tabs....i had passed a small carpark where I went up to one of the cars but before I could even speak he rolled his window up a d drove away (I don't blame him, some guy wearing a big black coat running towards your car at 3am would scare the shit out of you) but there was another car there too, 2 girls...I asked them to phone the police and told them my name  and just ran off
I found him walking along the beach area, he had taken his shoes off, I checked all his pockets and threw all the tabs in the sea, shortly after the police found us, and while they spoke to my friend the cop told me I 100% saved his life


A lot of hard hitting stuff has hit me over a short space of time, now I find myself avoiding friends, spending time in my room not speaking to family, not keeping fit or taking care of myself, not interested in women or relationships, not interested in doing fuck all.

As a teen I was always very sure of myself and had a sense of ""knowing who I was"" and what I wanted to do and how to reach my goals, now my goal is to go to my room and avoid confrontation from parents

I'm not suicidal, I don't take drugs because bad mental states and drugs don't mix, I smoke marijuana, that's it 

Someone give me advice",26Mar2019,1

Just a few weeks ago my cat who I loved quite a lot passed away from lungcancer, which was a pretty hard hit for me because I've had mental health problems for years now and finally when things were getting better this happened.
A week after this my second cat started showing signs of tumors as well so we took her to the vet to get them operated on.
The Vet said she had a lot of tumors and it'd need two session to get them all removed.
The first operation went extremely well and it looked good to begin with but then she started coughing a lot. Obviously we took her to the vet again and he checked her out, he said everything was fine and gave her some meds to make her breathing easier.

Second operation was yesterday and he removed the tumors, billed as 780€ in total and then told us she had less than 6 weeks to live.
The same day my grandmother as well got diagnosed with a tumor that will also have to be surgically removed.

We're not wealthy at all and payed about a month's income for the cat just for him to tell us she'll die soon, all of this is also going on a week before my diploma has to be finished and my matriculation exams are in a month. What the fuck do I do? I can't deal with this... ",26Mar2019,1
111,"I know I have a problem, I know that there’s something wrong with my brain chemistry, but I have to logically understand why little things cause me so much stress. Why do I think back years ago to something bad I said to someone that makes me feel guilty? Why does one problem at work, blow up in my brain to making me assume I’m getting fired? Why does one thing I said to my gf 2 years ago echo in my head all the time making me feel like I don’t deserve her? Why does everything I do wrong in life mean I severely disappointed someone when that is rarely the case?

I hate feeling this way, I try to de stress with common techniques that I have been told but it just comes back harder. This is more venting then actually asking, but I envy people that can go through life and only stress about big things that need to be stressed about.

&amp;#x200B;

Today I'm struggling with anxiety and depression for what feels like the 10,000th day in a row. I've got a freaking cold (maybe allergies?) and I'm paranoid its cancer. It's not - I went to the doctor. He gave me flonase :) And yet, here I am. I'm sure many of you are familiar.

I wanted to take a minute to tell you all that in the last few years, I've seen a therapist weekly (EMDR therapy), began exercising and lost 25ish pounds, started towards a career I love, and I'm still struggling with anxiety. I'm working as hard as I can to be as open and vulnerable with the people that I love and who love me, and I'm still struggling with anxiety. I've quit smoking, and I'm working to reestablish my relationship with food, and I'm still struggling with anxiety. Sleep has become an enormous priority, and I'm still struggling with anxiety. I've started to take my choices and their repercussions seriously, and I'm still struggling with anxiety. I have become determined to be as honest as I can about the place I am in, and make progress from there, and I'm still struggling with anxiety.

Today I realized I would be unhealthy, isolated, addicted, and headed down a dangerous path \_if it weren't for my journey with mental health and anxiety\_. So today I choose to say thank you to my journey, and to say \_I love you to my anxiety\_, because without this journey, I would never have made the progress in my life that I desperately needed to make.

Whoever you are, and wherever you are on your journey with anxiety and mental health, I hope this short writing meets you as a message of hope.

You are making progress. You are not alone. You might be like me, taking the smallest baby steps, but you are still moving forward. I pray you can take a moment today to feel that victory and pride in yourself. What a great challenge you have been faced with, and what a brave response you have met it with.

I hope someday you can love your anxiety, too.

prayers and love to all of you.",26Mar2019,3

118,"TW: general discussion of drugs/alcohol, suicide ment

&amp;#x200B;

I (22M) have Bipolar II/C-PTSD and last night my parents found me drinking along with my vape pen/adderall (prescribed) stash and safe to say they're pretty mad about it. I've been busted before (I'm not allowed to drink in the house they're very strict) and I'm very nervous b/c they've threatened to kick me out in the past for it. Spring is a hard time for me and I've been struggling, with the turn of the season I get really frustrated/agitated, i've been really depressed and i've gone back and forth between suicidal ideation/etc. 

 I've been trying to treat my depression for a long time now and it's been hard, I can't tolerate a lot of medications (minus prescribed lamotrigine and adderall/clonazepam) and after trying almost every SSRI I've finally decided to try an antipsychotic. I'm struggling to come to terms with the fact that I'm severely mentally ill and might have to be on meds that significantly impact my quality of life forever. I'm not anti medication, I'm just frustrated that nothing has worked minus ketamine (and that isn't legal or available to me) and where I live (Alaska) is... a terrible place for anyone with a mood disorder. I was prescribed Rexulti yesterday and was hopeful and optimistic, happy about it, but the pharmacy didn't have it in stock and impulsively I picked up alcohol out of frustration/agitation/sadness (unhealthy, I know, weed doesn't help my agitation and I don't plan on doing it anymore (i'm afraid of it triggering PTSD flashbacks) abusing drugs isn't good but it helps me cope - I don't plan on doing anything else after medication. I understand I fucked up, I broke the rules, and if I get kicked out it's my fault. I don't feel guilty about it (given I'm 22 but still know I broke rules, I don't pay for rent/phone/internet and know I'm really fortunate to be in the situation I'm in). 

On top of everything, I've missed my classes/am failing, and I'm thinking about withdrawing from university completely, maybe taking a semester/year off, it's my 3rd year of university and I... just don't care? I would consider myself fairly smart, one of the things I like most about myself is I've always excelled academically but my GPA is 2.5, my university is practically a community college and i've managed to get by doing the bare minimum and not using my full potential. I hate the idea of taking a semester off, but I feel like it might be best. 

 I work on campus and not going to school means I can't work so I'd have to find a job fast. They're crazy (my stepmom is a therapist and has insinuated that me drinking means I'll go overboard to the point of my s/o leaving me and ""diagnosed"" me with avoidant personality disorder one night after flipping through her DSM-IV for 5 minutes. I don't like being around her, thankfully they aren't physically abusive but she's mean and invasive, we don't have a good relationship. I don't have a place I could go to, I have one IRL friend and they know this - actually being forced out would be rare but I'm still nervous. 

That being said, it only happened last night and we're gonna talk about it today, my dad is much easier to talk to so I'll be honest with him and explain that I was drinking because I was a bit sad about being prescribed an antipsychotic (as I'm sensitive to side effects and really worried about what the rest of my life is going to look like) so hopefully he'll be understanding. He'll be upset that I wasn't forthcoming about my struggles but I think he'll understand. I have therapy tomorrow so I'll talk to my therapist about it as well, I'll see about my options with classes (moving out means i'm ineligible for tuition waiver, and debt is a big source of anxiety). I'm anxious, nervous, don't really know what to do, generally just feel bad. If anyone has any advice/been in a similar situation I'd appreciate any advice/support, thanks guys 💖

TLDR: parents found me drinking/etc, not allowed in my house and in a really rough spot mental health wise, thinking moving out/being away from them/taking a break from uni might be the best option but really anxious about debt, want to stay in school but I need to be stable ",26Mar2019,1
119,"Ok, disclaimer: this was written like a 10 year old (I'm 25/f) but really needed to post. 

I saw this counselor for 2 years. She is absolutely amazing and really helped me. But for some reason, I just told the office to cancel my appointments. It was just on impulse and kind of just me being dramatic. I didn't talk to her, just left. I really, really liked talking to her. I really feel heartbroken about it, I know I very much need to be in counseling. I really have no idea why I decided to stop. It's only been a few weeks and I feel really embarrassed calling her and asking to come again, and I also don't know if I would now fit in her schedule. It is through a program and is have to ask if I asked to go back, could I pick my counselor. What if she had too many clients? Her schedule was always packed and it was had getting an appointment for weeks. What do you think? 

But anyway she called my sister a couple weeks ago because she cannot call me because I abruptly stop going and ended it on bad terms. But she said that she really wanted to call me, that I can come back and anytime, and it's okay if I didn't want to open up and she would help me through that. I don't know what to think about that. I'm kind of certain it just common courtesy for a counselor to call like that? Just what they have to do. I don't know. I don't know if I want to go back because I end up being the really shity person in therapy and I don't like how I act. Lately discussions haven't been let great and I feel really that I now have a wall up and can't talk to her. So, I stopped kind of because I don't want to waste either of our time. Will it be productive? 

But she's absolutely amazing and we had a good relationship for 2 years. Do you think she wants me back? You think it's okay for me to call? Is it embarrassing to call only a month after stopping? I'd really don't know what to do. What do you think about all the questions I have?",26Mar2019,1
120,"Hi there.

&amp;#x200B;

The title might be a little confusing,but I wasn't really sure how to express the problem in a few words.

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is that I used to be an average kiddo.Had some friends,some foes,etc...

But somewhere in between that time and present I broke down and spent over 2 years just closed into myself,strongly introverted,getting fatter and fatter.

A year ago I changed my mindset and now I am in a lot better mental and physical shape,but spending time around others just doesn't feel anyway close to what it used to be.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I somehow managed to kill most of my feelings towards people,It kinda was a sort of a goal during those 2 tough years.

Usually most social things I do with people I met during or after that 2 year period are not really controlled by emotions,but forced to my brain by me myself. I literally often feel stronger emotions towards some machines than those people,but at the other hand emotions to people I met before all that do still remain.

I don't know If i am just not meeting right people or that 2 year period made such a big impact on me.But I will be thankful for any advice.",26Mar2019,1
121,"I think I can pinpoint the year I transitioned from a happy, outspoken teenager to the beginning of my mental decline.

I remember going to summer camp when i was 13, and that was the last time I really remember being sociable and happy. When school started back up that year, I started becoming more awkward and shy. This led to self isolation and lack of interest in anything.

Since then, I’ve just been going through the motions. Approximately a decade of not really knowing who I am, and not striving for any goals. My reward system feels broken, and I feel like I’ve failed my old self. I’ve most definitely been depressed for a long time, which I’m only just now starting to address.

I’d do anything to go back to 13 year old me again. I remember it so clearly, singing on the bus over there, using my skateboard on my lap as the drums 😂. Growing up really sucks. Wish I could have gotten help for my problems earlier. What happened?",26Mar2019,1
122,"My SO's parents are extremely emotionally abusive and manipulative. Particularly his mother. After stalking, harassing, and threatening us for several months, they were both totally cut out of our lives. We did everything short of legal action since after we changed our phone numbers and moved apartments, the harassment totally stopped. we figured they got the message, finally. Cut to two weeks ago, they've somehow gotten ahold of SO's current/new email address, and started sending him pages and pages of horrible messages, including the fact that they've started seeing a therapist who is evidently affirming and validating everything they've told them. It is pretty clear to us that this therapist is NOT getting the whole picture, and might not even be offering services to SO's parents if he knew the extent of the abuse. (or else this therapist just shouldnt' have a license, haha)

Because of the most recent contact, we will finally be moving forward with restraining orders--within the last two weeks alone SO's mother has threatened both of our lives multiple times. 

Is it within the realm of acceptable to make direct contact with this therapist and share with him screenshots of the ongoing abuse we've received? They shared with us the name of the doctor, saying we could contact him if we wanted but ""he knows the real story."" This whole situation makes me feel extremely disassociated, like I cannot trust my own perception of reality--and the fact that an outside person is reportedly validating SO's parents' perceptions makes this feel even more hurtful and confusing. Is it silly or pointless to try to share the truth with this doctor? ",26Mar2019,1
123,"TLDR at the end. 

As the title says, I’m worried about bringing up a new concern I have for myself to my doctor when I already have other things wrong with me. I’ve never felt 100% comfortable with this doctor but I’ve been visiting them for more than a year and a half now and they see and treat me well. 
I’m currently diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety and have been on respective medications for both, but I have a growing fear that I may be bipolar. Even on days that I don’t take my medication, I have significant and sudden changes in my moods, energy, and a lot of other things. My family first made me aware of this behavior about 5 years ago. I brought it up to my old doctor (changed docs bc I moved) who thought the mood changes were due to depression so I was placed on an antidepressant and taken off shortly after with the only explanation that I am feeling this way due to stress with school. Since then, I’ve continued to exhibit these same mood swings but as mental health awareness has spread, I believe it was never only depression and instead some type of bipolar disorder. I’m just so so nervous about saying “I think I’m exhibiting bipolar behavior and have been for quite some time” bc I don’t want to be taken off my current medication. Then if they add medication, I don’t want the pharmacy tech to give me that look, walk over to the pharmacist to ensure I’ve had a record taking these sorts of medications, then walk back over and say “we’ll have it ready by noon.” 

Obviously I’m so very anxious about this already and honestly just wanted to reach out to see if anyone within this community has experienced anything of similar context. As a side note, I understand that bipolar disorder is more than mood swings. I am not talking about being happy one hour then not getting off work early and my entire mood changes. An example I experienced today was that I was in a great mood all morning long, full of energy, and very outgoing and friendly. Within the same morning, I pulled up to a stop light and looked at the car in front of me and all of a sudden I felt sudden gloom and doom out of no where. Nothing triggered it, not a song, smell, or memory, just mentally negativity came over me after a great and positive morning. There are more examples but I feel like if I continue I’ll just come off as trying to prove myself which is not what this post is about. I really just want to reach out and see what your experiences are, if any. I don’t feel comfortable talking to my family or friends. My mom’s a nurse so she might get the medical side of it but even then, she doesn’t believe anything is wrong with me and thinks all of my doctors visits and medical records hurt me in getting potential jobs. 

TLDR: overcoming anxiety about bringing up a potential new mental disorder when you already have several. ",26Mar2019,1
124,"I've suffered from depression and anxiety for many many years, and I'm really not improving at all, despite my best efforts, it seems like I may been getting worse as time goes on. I've tried just about every antidepressant out there over the years. Been doing talk therapy for a year (still going, It hasn't been too helpful to me but I still think it's a good idea). I exercise almost every day (for the past 4 years), I eat well, I sleep well.

Over time, trying so many different options, and having depression/anxiety still kicks my ass, it makes me even more depressed, like there is no hope and things will just never get better. I've been just miserable. I wake up in the morning and immediately start thinking about all the little things that have gone wrong recently. Nothing major. Just little things that really bothered me that I keep dwelling on for no good reason. I always dwell on the negative and never give myself credit for doing things like cleaning my room, going to the gym, or helping a friend.

There is definitely a problem in the way I think and the way I perceive the world. I've got such a negative view of people and the world in general. Another big issue is I have way too much free time on my hands, and nothing to do with it. I don't know what to do to fill up the time. My life has never gotten on track, I've never had any goals or aspirations. I've had jobs, but it seems like there is nothing I am passionate about. Currently looking into volunteer work, but I have a feeling I won't like it. Worth a try, though.

Just venting, sorry! I am going to try and have a good day today. I am cautiously optimistic that today is actually going to be a good one. Hope you have a good day, too.",26Mar2019,1

I looked online at symptoms and realized that I fit every single on of them.

126,"My dad and I get in these extremely emotionally charged, heated disputes. They don't start that way, they inflate slowly, and the more I ""try"" to stop it from getting there, the more he pushes on me ""not understanding the point"", and ""trying to just diffuse it and not talk about the real issue"", and says I'm very immature and should be listening to him because he is more experienced and a lot older (which he is right, I understand that but I disagree with him on a subject, and he uses that as a stand point and something to validate himself). 

&amp;#x200B;

Anytime he does this, I always interpret it as he's simply trying to keep the argument going for attention and emotional charged validation from himself. I know this is a horrible thing to think but he is a stay at home dad, both of his kids (me and my brother) have moved out, and he doesn't do much. I think it's a way for him to feel connected to us, and he's always worried about what my brother and me think of him (he is very insecure). I understand that the way he has chosen to live his life is judged by society. I know he was judged by his parents and put down all the time from his mother. I don't want to make the same mistakes he does so I try to emotionally detach from our arguments and view them logically, as a way to avoid the escalation and immaturity, and avoiding feeling judged by my dad.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate viewing my dad this way, but I can't help but judge him for what he does, he judged me a lot as his child too. I think this is horrible and I have realized how much I have been affected by this now that I am older and live on my own. I too have become more insecure and more in need of validation and emotional attention from people I date. I don't like this about myself. I always feel my internal voice judging myself and I infer it stems from my dad. It is my job to curve this.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to say for context, we are VERY similar. I know it is common for this to cause a lot of tension and arguments, but also a lot of connection and intimacy in relationships. Pros and cons. Because we are so similar, usually our reactions are very similar to certain things. Both of us are very emotionally aware, high EQ, picking up on non verbal cues and very observant. We can really use this against each-other sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

So here was our recent argument. I have been interested in purchasing a scooter (like a vespa) and both of my parents are very against it and worried for my safety on the roads. They think it puts me out of control and that I'm not a great driver in a car so why would I be on a scooter. I know they are right, it is dangerous, so when they speak I know they are coming from a place of caring for me. But my dad, in his method of preventing this information, judges me. He says I'm not a good biker. He threatens he's going to ""shut down"" and emotionally detach from his children because we aren't listening to him and are going to get ourselves killed because we are doing dangerous things. He storms off, shuts down, overall acts like a child (in my opinion). My mother on the other hand came to me and and calmly explained why its not a good idea at my age, I heard her and listened to her. I mentioned this to my dad, how I think that the way he presents the information hinders in my ability to actually hear his point. He blew up. Explained how slimy and manipulative it is for me to compare my mom and my dad and to turn us against each other. That I'm ruining the dynamics of the family when I come home. I think it's ridiculous, how far all of it goes. But he is right, I do understand the emotional implications of me saying my mom is right and my dad is wrong. I feel bad about that but can't help but do that.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand the emotional implications of what I say during arguments, I have high emotional awareness and empathy so I knew that my dad would feel judged when I mentioned that to him about my mom. But in a way I feel that is not my problem. It logically it supported my point. I'm trying to show him that maybe we could have better disagreements if we weren't so emotionally charged and more calm.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to learn something from this, be an adult and mature from this. I don't want to fuel myself, don't want to think I'm right and get validation, but I also don't want to give in and let me dad keep doing what he's doing.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I think I'm going to far with this and letting it affect me too much. Sorry this is long, I would really appreciate someone else's opinion on this.",26Mar2019,1
127,"I thought maybe dyslexia but I’m not sure, to start I can’t spell words ( sometimes easy words ) very well. For instance without autocorrect on I’ll spell things like this. I also mispronounce words very easily and struggle with the pronunciation of more complex words 
-vaccume 
-spinnich 
-beutiful

I also take time to get my own left and right correct and it is even more confusing when someone says “ my left/ “ same goes for clockwise/counter clockwise and I never really got that down until age 14-15. Same goes for AM/PM which honestly still can confuse me to this day as I’ll set and alarm and have to double check in my mind that the alarm is set correctly.

I also get my numbers backward, I used to have a cashier job and if their total was 15.76 I’d catch myself saying 15.67 or just totally missing the mark and saying 15.43 after seeing two different numbers before reading out the total. 

Months are another thing, you might ask someone “ what month is October “ and they could probably say “ the seventh “ month with ease however I have to count the months out on my fingers because if I try to do it in my head it confuses me a lot.

When it comes to directions I can think of how to get somewhere easier if I think of it backwards, as if I was there and worked my way home. I also do not do well with street names but rather landmarks ( ex: take a left at the McDonald’s with a broken arch and then a right at the bridge with a cat graffitied on it ) 

As a last note I read well but fast and don’t really remember much about a book I’ve read except big details. ( like the group of friends had powers and I remember one bit about a giant cat but not really much else about the book outside of small irrelevant details )

I’m bad at remembering names and phone numbers as well, took me forever to remember my ss number.

128,"So I've been struggling with anxiety/DPDR for around 7 months, and all of a sudden I've started to have a really toxic relationship with food and healthy eating (not going to go into detail but basically I intentionally stop myself from finishing my meals/eating things I want). I also feel like I'm trapped in the wrong body (I don't think I'm trans but something is wrong in my mind).

I feel like people are going to see me as one of those attention seeking people like ""I hAVe dEpreSsION ANd sChiZophREniA anD mY LIfE suCKs"" if I tell people about my problems. I've told about 5 people about my DPDR (I'm getting psychiatric help for that) and one person about the food thing. I'm worried that if I reach out to people about the other things I'm feeling they aren't going to take me seriously or think I'm trying to be edgy or whatever.

I know people who tell everyone about their mental health to get sympathy points, and I never want to be like that. I don't want sympathy.

I was thinking about talking to my dad about the 'trapped in the wrong body' thing (he's very good at giving advice), but I feel like he won't see me in the same way if I start talking about all these things that I've never mentioned to him before.

I genuinely don't know what to do. I feel trapped.",26Mar2019,2
129,"Hi guys. So a few days ago my girlfriend of almost 3 years broke up with me. It is completely my fault, I didn't try and get better, I just kept suffocating her. To say I'm the jealous type is putting it mildly. I'm incredibly paranoid, jealous, I would get anxious when I wasn't with her. I've based my happiness, my sanity on her and it pushed her away. I have no one to blame but myself. I'm dying, I've almost had so many panic attacks and I've never had an issue with panic attacks. I've barely eaten in 3 days, simply because my stomach is so knotted up. 

I just want to get better, for myself and for her. I can't stop my mind from racing, from thinking about her moving on and being with another guy. I know she deserves to be happy, I want her to even if it means it's not with me. I know there is a good chance of getting her back, but if I don't find a way to get better, it just won't last.

Who do I talk do? A therapist? A psychologist? A behavioral specialist? I don't know who specifically to see.

133,"Mostly a rant post since I'm stressing so much over this right now. My mom is against it, and she's the one who told me about what they wanted to do. Apparently taking away the few things that make me happy anymore is going to make me not depressed anymore. Uh what?  Doesn't help that my sister's bf is studying psychology and putting a bunch of crap into her head about what needs to be done. I had a small panic attack last week and my sibling was intentionally trying to freak me out afterwards, sending me into pretty bad another panic attack, and my mom showed me the texts they were sending during it saying ""it was confirmed I was crazy and sending myself into psychosis.""

137,"I (24M) have had a host of issues since I was an adolescent. Anxiety, obsessive-compulsive behavior, long-lasting sadness, and loneliness.

I was a weird kid and got bullied alot in middle school and to a lesser extent in high school. It was around this time that I started having intense fears of people in my life abandoning me or secretly loathing me. I developed alot of trust issues. What also compounded this issue is the toxic presence of my older sister. She, like me, had confidence issues growing up, which was largely fed by my parents ""favoring me"" over both of her and my other sister. My parents have issues with anger control, would get into massive arguments in front us, and our mother would take her anger out on the three of us. It happened more frequently to my sisters, but I still got it alot too. I was called retarded, stupid, a f*****, would get hit (not as much as my twin sister). I was routinely reminded of how I was going to be a failure (I did the bare minimum and got low Bs, which was unacceptable in an Indian household). I should have known that I would be resented for life by my older sister because of it. (I love my parents and I don't care as much about their behavior growing up because I know for a fact, that they have their own inner demons that they could not ever manage. There were still plenty of good moments that we all experienced, but there is also an abundance of bad moments).
Anyway, my sister ""found her confidence"" in college, which she thought gave her the right to lecture everyone else about their issues. With me, she would routinely go on baffling diatribes (She would literally go on rants about how I'm an idiot, simply for doing something or talking about something she didn't like). When I was 18, she had me and my other sister come to visit her. It was literally a weekend of being berated and talked to like I was less than a human. She then texted me to tell me that I wasn't what she pictured her brother as. 
Her animosity reached an absolutely nauseating peak when she physically attacking me on Christmas because I told her to leave our other sister alone when she was going off about how she was cooking. She had to be restrained by our other sister. To this day, she refuses to take responsibility for this and blames everyone else in the family (including me). Years of this has turned me into someone who is constantly thinking about my flaws. I finally decided that whatever relationship that was left, was over for good. She had an outburst on a group chat where she pointed out of all of my flaws and mental health issues in front of other people because I ""interrupted her"". In reality, my message was delayed because I didn't have connection when she was talking. 

In college, I started to get depressed, didn't socialize with anyone, dressed lazily, and rarely groomed myself. I cried daily in my bed for roughly a year (including the summer and winter breaks). I started getting happier as graduation neared and then felt depressed right after graduation because I had nothing else in my life. No girlfriend, no real friends, nothing. It was the end of a pretty awful four years.
I passed my boards and what followed was the result of years of low confidence, anxiety, and depression rolled into one. I became utterly depressed and resentful towards myself. I truly turned into a shut-in and would literally just spend hours having internal melt-downs.
I go t a job at a hospital (I'm an RN) and stumbled out of the gate. I ended up quitting in less than three months (They were on the verge of firing me anyway. I was awful). I got another job working in public health, where I get paid 70k rather than 80k. 

I am out of shape so I've been working out more. I have lost some weight and I am putting on a bit more muscle, so that's one positive thing in my life.
I still can't feel happy at all. I haven't felt happy in over ten years.
In the last few months. I have been having alot of anxiety around relationships. I'm 24 and I'm still single. I'm moving out to my own place and I'm terrified of coming home to an empty apartment every day. There are moments where I literally freeze up when I think about this. I know I have to love myself before I love anyone else, but how can someone who's thought of themselves as ugly and  unappealing to talk for years love himself?
How can someone who thinks about ending it once every week love himself?

I'm thinking about therapy, but I'm terrified of starting it. I've even considered committing myself but I don't want anyone, especially my bosses, to know that I am probably mentally ill (I have never been diagnosed). I just need to get better but I don't know how.

138,"High School.  Junior year.  Need I say more?

I’m currently enrolled in two college-level classes, along with the rest of my regular high school classes.  I have multiple responsibilities at home.  I have ADHD and GAD, which makes it very hard to relax as well.

My issue is that when I do have the time to relax, I become sad due to the feeling that I am not useful or that I do not serve a purpose.  I have become so used to being mentally and physically occupied for hours straight every day, that when I relax or take time for myself I subconsciously view it as laziness (even though I logically know I deserve it, and relaxation is needed).  I want to relax and be happy, but how in the world do I even do that anymore?  This has gotten so bad to the point that I will neglect eating sometimes during lunch in order to complete homework assignments.  

I think this has majorly to due with my overbearing parents, who expect me to have A’s and B’s along with fulfilling multiple responsibilities that I have at home.  If I don’t do them or forget, my mother emotionally manipulated me into feeling bad.

Any advice on how I should break this cycle?",26Mar2019,3
139,"I suspect that I have NPD, so everything being said about me is 100% true. I also have never changed in my entire life. 

Anyway, I was wondering if it's considered abuse if I deserve to be treated badly since I am a toxic person. Because of my defensive personality, I've been getting into fights with my sister nonstop for the past year. My sister repeats how I'm toxic from excessive negativity, defensive, stupid, shallow, annoying, arrogant, that nobody will ever be able to tolerate me so I'll end up single forever, that I'll die early from a heart attack, that I'm crazy and have only been a negative effect on the entire family, that I'm delusional for preaching about how family should always come first when I'm the most selfish person alive, that in the world I'm in the top percentage of disgusting personality, etc. 

All the stuff she says to me makes me feel bad about myself and even makes me feel like I'm being abused even though I know everything being said is true. Is it possible to be abused by someone if I'm the issue? Am I just victimizing myself?",26Mar2019,1

142,"My husband and I have been together for 7 years in June, so I met his son CJ when he was 5; he is currently 12. He also has a daughter, 15 yo A, who is very bright, friendly, and kind. Cj is different. He lies, a lot. Always has. He creates tension and drama whenever possible. He is rude to my 9 yo son and bossy to our 4 yo daughter. However, CJ is also bright and very creative. 

Before I met his children I was told by my DH and his ex that their daughter A would be the tough sell out of the two of them. While both kids seemed very guarded, A and I hit it off almost immediately. I was put into the gifted program in school after I skipped first grade; A was being tested to possibly be put into a different school Bc of her high intelligence. I feel, over the years, she is my oldest child I never gave birth to. These days, she’s troubled. But you can feel the strength in that young woman. She’s resilient and adaptable. 

CJ is the complete opposite. Believe me, I have tried my absolute best with him. I tell him all the time that he is very intelligent, but, unlike his sister, his is harder to measure. Which is true. He’s very creative. An out of the box thinker. I offer positive encouragement often. When I can tell he’s lying, I don’t punish him when the truth comes out. I have totally lost my cool with him, I’ll admit. But he just wants to oppose what I say for his enjoyment. I once told him he was lucky he was a boy Bc ppl believe men more than women, gender discrimination etc, and he argued with me tooth and nail. Like ok 10 year old, you obviously know more about life than I do. It pissed me off and I know he meant to do it. I’m really pretty good about keeping my cool but that kid knows how to push buttons. 

About 3 years ago we were at my dads house, having a pool party. CJ squished frogs in front of the other kids, then laughed. My son saw it along w 2 other boys. No adults saw it happen, but my stepmom found the dead frogs iirc. When we asked him about it, of course he denied it. My DH believed him. I did not. But as much as I felt like something was wrong, I was powerless to do anything about it. A and CJ have always lived with their mother.  As the custodial parent, she controls their day to day life. If she doesn’t want them in therapy, they’re not gonna get it. We’ve always lived about an hour away from their house. They used to come over almost every single weekend, but for about 18 months we see them once a month at most. A comes over like every 3 months. 

Their mother, I’ll call her X, is something else. Every year they pack up and move in with a different boyfriend of hers. Their house REEKS of cat piss, like it burns my eyes it’s so bad. Both the kids currently have ringworm. CJ has impetigo, so a rash from staph/strep on his buttocks and face. They just live in very gross conditions. We’ve always told them they were more than welcome to come be with us. Bc they are. And they really need to leave that situation But they never wanted to. For a couple of years, A has had a very strained relationship with my DH. After some digging on my part, I A told me X said my DH didn’t think CJ was his son. A said her mom X told her DH thought CJs REAL dad was his uncle, who lives with CJ, A, and X. This is NOT TRUE. DH has NEVER said anything like that. So A has thought her dad was REALLY messed up. Bc that’s what her mom told her. I would hate my dad if he thought my brother was a product of incest between my mom and my uncle, her brother. 

X has been lying to these kids. Keeping CJ and A away from us, poisoning their minds against us. Isolating them. Typical sociopath behavior. That’s why they never wanted to live with us. My DH has a lot of guilt about how their marriage ended, about leaving the kids. He’s more passive than I am, but he’s a good person. We have been dealing with our own issues too. But it’s just become so much more obvious that these kids are in an increasingly dark situation. 

Then two days ago, both kids come over for the weekend. FINALLY. I almost begged A to come Bc she wasn’t going to at first. But I knew something was bad. Something wrong. I flipped out two months ago about a sociopath in our midst. I knew A and CJ were sick and stupidly thought my DH was to blame. While he’s not perfect, he’s not bad. Narcissistic at times, but same here. We both changed a lot of unhealthy behaviors. But I felt like I had to protect A from something bad. I knew she had something to tell me. Something awful. Even after DH and I underwent some major changes. 

She tells us Saturday night she saw her brother force an air conditioner cord into her pet bunny’s mouth, electrocuting it. She saw him kill her pet bunny. Over a year ago. 

My heart sank. I almost had a panic attack. I thought of all the lies, the manipulative behavior, the frog killing incident. I hate that I didn’t push harder over those frogs, but what kid hasn’t killed frogs?? I have. Certainly not like that... but still. A said a lot of their pets go missing or die for no obvious reason. 

We questioned him about losing pets, and I feel like he gave us a rundown of all his past crimes. Superficial emotions, overly poetic about their beautiful nature. Just so full of crap. “Oh poor sweet domino (the cat)! He left so much before his time!” This cats collar was found, obviously taken off by a person. He said that himself. But he said they found his mutilated body by a tree. A said they never found the cats body. I know he killed that cat. 

Obviously we are going to get him professional help. I believe I’m what’s called an empath, I feel ppls emotions. I understand most ppl insanely well. This kid tho, I look at him and see a serial killer. Even before the bunny incident. I feel like we HAVE to attempt to help him, but he is going to hurt us DEEPLY. My 4 yo daughter is sweet, cute, innocent, trusting. I feel like he’s going to hurt her. 

I’ve researched this as much as possible in the past two days as I can. We watched a YouTube video about how to spot a lie, took notes. I’m not even sure how to begin preparing myself for this. If anyone has any ideas, let me know. Any good websites, message boards, meetings. Anything. I know DH and I have to be stronger than we ever thought about being. 

What am I going to do?? 

TLDR: my stepson force fed a rabbit an air conditioning cord to kill it by electrocution. We are moving him and his sister in with us in two months due to them currently living in an incredibly bad situation. Any advice besides the obvious “get him professional help” is appreciated, as we know that HAS to happen. 

Thank you for reading! 

We are moving his kids into our home in two months when school is out.

146,"For as long as I can remember I have suffered with social anxiety which caused me to drop out of college and would cause me a lot of distress. After social situations I will sit anywhere from minutes to hours and replay social situations in my head. This can be from thinking ""Did I insult anyone?"", ""What will they think of me?"" Or ""Have I revealed too much information about myself?"", which can be about anything in my life, even if it isn't something bad. Over thinking is a big part of my life, from past, present and future. I'm forever over thinking scenorios in my head or every aspect of my life. 

I've also always had a weird thing that is hard to explain involving numbers and letters for as long as I can remember.  I can read a word off literally anything and trace it on the roof of my mouth using the tip of my tongue but I will change the order and reassemble it and add more letters to make it even if it's an odd number. It's a bit of a weird concept to explain, even my family don't understand it. I do it with numbers as well like say 1 to 4. I'll trace it in my mouth as '1,3,4,2' and then reconnect it making it '1234'. I've done this for as long as I can remember. I didn't tell my doctor this part as I was unsure of how important it was.

I didn't tell my doctor but when I was younger around 14/15 I had undiagnosed bulimia and I would sit in the mirror for hours pointing out issues with my body and sit Googling pictures of what I wished I'd looked like. The bulimic behaviour stopped after almost a year due to the fact that I didn't want to damage my teeth, which is another thing I absolutely obsess over and go out of my way to make sure nothing happens to them which includes spending lots of money on oral hygiene essentials and I will obsess and panic if I think there's something wrong with my teeth which can happen on a daily basis. I have horrible thoughts of if something was to happen to them, thus making me avoid this things. And say if I knock my tooth on a cup, I will repeat this act to determine if I would have don't damage. This is with many other things in my life as well. 

However, since stopping making myself sick I've stuck to a rather strict eating pattern of eating two meals a day but I'm not anorexic, just very skinny. I stand in the mirror for hours obsessing over my body from what my teeth looks like to the size of my nose. This caused my to bleach my hair so much that it's all almost fell out. Anything I dislike about myself I will go out my way to change including spending lots of money on the particular area and it often changes what I spend time obsessing over. At the age of 20 I have already got myself into debt around 3 times totalling around £12,000 which was spent on clothes, drugs and insignificant things. 

I've had two very unsuccessful relationships in the past three years. The first being controlling and sometimes abusive which didn't help with my anxiety however whilst I was with the second I ruined the relationship by spending lots of money on drinking, drugs and buying clothes. I smoked marijuana without him knowing for fear of rejection as I was always paranoid that he would leave me for someone better. I would try and buy affection by spending absurds amount of money on him. 

Since January 2018 to current I have smoked weed almost everyday to make myself feel numb and to try and use it as a coping method. 
I find it hard to drink and enjoy it because I end up regretting it in the morning due to something always going wrong. The last time I drank I nearly got arrested for trying to runaway from the Police. When I drink I usually hurt myself or others around me when I do, or I at least think I do and dwell on it making me embarrassed and ashamed of what I've done.

I grew up in a rough area, my dad was always critical of me (and still is), I can't remember the last time he ever praised me for anything I did. My parents in general never took an interest or cared about anything I was interested in, disconnecting us even further. 
I made some bad friends who constantly made me feel like shit, I was bullied, a lot. 
I grew up without being close to anyone really, I can barely talk to new people, I've never been in a relationship yet.

150,"I just found out that one of my best friends (he's like a brother to me) is on a 72 hour hold (suicide watch). i think he checked himself into the hospital, which is pretty great (he's mentioned to me before that he's almost checked himself in; i'm just glad he got help instead of... well, the other thing he was thinking of doing). he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about 6 or 8 months ago, and he's been dealing with severe depression on and off for a few years, plus some substance abuse (which he has been doing better with as of the past couple of months).

what I want to ask is, what should i do? I was thinking of going to visit him on the last day. we're the kind of friends that are always there to support each other, even if it's just sitting there with him and not saying anything, and giving him a hug. he doesn't have to talk with me about this if he doesn't want to, but I just want to be there for him. would you recommend this? I'm not going in to ask for an explanation or anything; just to be there for him. also, if you were in his situation, what would you want a best friend to do/say (if anything)?",26Mar2019,1
151,"I took a train to Seattle from Vancouver, Canada. Shit’s crazy. People there don’t have time to breathe &amp; attain total calm. Big city = big problems. The bigger the city, the more stressful it is, at least in my mind. 

But since I live in a small city, I find it really easy to breathe &amp; clean my mind up; clear mental health issues that frequent me. And there’s a lot.

But I still ascertain that people should at least try to do as Mr. Rogers said &amp; take 30 seconds or a minute out of your day to think about those who you love &amp; who love you on earth and even those in heaven. ❤️ 

It’s difficult, some days impossible, but that’s life, if there is a God &amp; I do believe there is, then relax in knowing you’re going to be fine in the arms of the lord, if there’s no god, then relax in knowing you’re going to be fine in the arms of your family and loved ones.

152,"I'm currently in a city where I met some truly wonderful people but sadly, in the next few months I will go back to my home country and have to pick up where I left off. I created a little life for myself here and it breaks my heart to leave all the lovely people I've met the past few months. I have abandonment issues and feel my worries are heightened by this, so it makes the pain even worse. I've been overanalyzing situations and on the verge of tears when I think about this happening in a few months. Also, this isn't the first time this has happened to me and realize it's a part of life, but damn, it is just so hard to deal with at the moment (or in the future). I  just want to enjoy the rest of my time and let these people know how special they are to me. Thanks for listening. ",26Mar2019,1

I don't want to say I was depressed because I had no idea if that was the case. But anyway, I got better over summer and through September. But then high school started (please don't attack me I'm a freshman) and ever since I've just been feeling constantly stressed. There's always something I have to stress about next. It leads to me enjoying pretty much nothing. I haven't been happy for more than a day at a time since winter break.

157,"Hi, for some context I'm 16 and suffer from social anxiety. 

This past year I made huge strides after I was pur on medication and I'm afraid I'm going back. 

I've started to isolate myself from friends and family and I've started to prefer it that way. My depression (caused by anxiety) has crept back and the self harm thoughts that have lingered for years have come with it. 

I dont know what I'm doing, but I feel so much safer when I'm not with others. What should I do? ",26Mar2019,1
158,"Hey, i'm kinda in a bad place right now and i dont really know how to get out of it, so i thought i'd share my story here, maybe there are other people who are experiencing the same thing atm. 
I'm in my early twenties, and i study Physics right now, the problem is there's no way i'm going to pass my exams and advance in my studies but quite frankly i dont really want to. I enjoyed Physics in high school but i really hate everything about classes this year, i stopped attending classes because it was 8hours a day and i hated every single minute of it. So i wanna change next year but the problem is i've already changed one time after failing med school last year (i enjoyed med school but i wasnt skilled enough to make it) and this means i wont get any financial support from my country anymore for my 3rd year (i didnt knew this until a few days ago) but i wanna continue to study. My parents dont know this (that im failing this year and that i wont get money anymore) and i really dont know what to do right now regarding this situation. They don't have enough money to support my studies. 
I'm also quite lonely and don't have a lot of friends atm so its kinda hard for me to deal with this situation. I'm close with my roommate who's thankfully looking after me atm but he's emotionally distant and doesnt like to talk about that stuff, and when i told him he couldnt believe it, that i handled my financial situation so badly, he just told me that it's my own fault (I agree) that I should grow up, deal with the situation and stop moaning about it. On top of that i've spend the last few months trapped in my appartment smoking pot and i feel like i've lost all my social skills, every time i leave the appartment i feel uncomfortable and every time i interract with someone, it ends up being weird. 
I really want to stress that I absolutely want to continue studying but I dont know how and I feel trapped and alone atm with my future collapsing in front of my eyes. Does anyone have some advice? ",26Mar2019,1

160,"I've had bad CPTSD since I was 5, tried slitting my wrists for the first time at that age to give you an idea of how long and deep the trauma runs.
Lately, I've been being hounded by memories. I'll be trying to load a bowl but find myself spacing out staring at the counter, standing in the same spot, and then look at the clock and half an hours/HOURS will have gone by of me just remembering my abuse. And there's so much to remember. It's ruining my life, I can't go even an hour without recalling events. My memory seems to be getting worse too, just the other day I kept trying to pronounce 376,000, except I kept saying ""three seventy six hundred thousand-wait, three hundred seventy six hundred thousand-wait, that's not right"", and I almost started crying because I knew I was saying it wrong, I could remember the childhood class I learned it in, the memory was there, I just couldn't access it. That's just one example, but more and more it happens with me forgetting things I KNOW I know. I've had this problem for years, a therapist once suggested it's because I've had C-PTSD for so long my mind start automatically censoring even non traumatic info because it's getting confused, though I don't know if that's a thing. At the same time, I seem to remember more and more of the abuse while being able to make/retain less memories Lately, I feel like I'm more just a collection of memories with likes and dislikes than an actual person, consequences don't seem real to me, reality seems like it doesn't touch me if that makes sense. I can think of an outcome in my life, even if it's bad, and feel nothing. I forget more and more, I feel like I'm losing my mind and it's more than casual dissociation. What's happening to me?

161,"My boyfriend’s mental health hasn’t been great as of lately. He thinks he has depression and needs to see a therapist at the very least, which I agreed with him. He didn’t grow up in a loving family, and as soon as he graduated college he was thrown into the real world because his parents didn’t want to pay for him to go to college. He thinks he’s a failure and it breaks my heart hearing that. He wanted me to leave him and is convinced that he’s going to hurt me, but I love him and I told him I am here through EVERYTHING, even all the really tough times like these. I myself went through some depression myself over the past few months (seasonal depression), and he’s been there every step of the way. Now it’s my turn to help him.

He says he’s not suicidal, but he told me that he’s tired of feeling this way and he can’t do it anymore. Him saying that has scared me, and I’ve been staying on top of him making sure that he feels loved and cared for. I compiled a list of things I wanna get him and do for him. I know during a time like this my best thing to do is to be supportive, but I feel like I should be doing more. I know at the end of the day it is up to him to get the help that he needs and for him to get it together, but I feel like anyone who’s going through a tough time just needs SOMEONE. Is there anything I should watch out for in terms of what he says or his body language? Am I doing okay? I’m really concerned for him. Any advice would be helpful because I feel lost on what to do. I’ve been through this before with friends, but never with an SO. ",26Mar2019,1
162,"Not exactly sure of where to post this but I feel like this obsession of mine is taking over my daily life. For the past 2 years I have been extremely obsessed with the USSR. As soon as I get home every day I listen to hours of Soviet or East German music. I always study the history and am beginning to naturally pick up the Russian language. I have purchased many items of memorabilia and books from the USSR. Just about 15 minutes ago I ordered the Soviet Constitution, which made me review my obsession with the USSR and prompted me to make this post. I knew this obsession turned serious when I actually found myself arguing with someone in defense of the USSR. All day there are soviet songs stuck in my head and it's almost all I can think of. To summarize, what can I do to try and mitigate such obsessive thoughts? I believe these things line up with the base signs of an obsession, which begs the question: How can I be less obsessed?",26Mar2019,1
163,"Hey everybody. New to this page so not entirely sure how this works, but here goes.

I've dealt with depression and anxiety for many years now, though I wasn't officially diagnosed until about 2 years ago after a horrible panic attach finally prompted me to go see a doctor. Doc advised me to start therapy and go see a psychiatrist. It's been an interesting journey.

In September 2018, I attempted to take my life 3 times in a matter of 2 days, attempting twice in the same day. This prompted my boss to authorize a medical leave of absence and my psychiatrist enrolled me in a partial hospitalization program.

I spent 3 weeks in the program and felt I made significant progress through the group therapy sessions, daily one on one sessions, the connections I made with other patients, and the other various forms of therapy they had (creative, education, music). 

In November, roughly 1-2 weeks after being discharged from partial hospitalization, I attempted to kill myself again after an hour or two I spent self harming. I was punching walls and doors and violently banging my head on windows, countertops, and walls. I took it a step further by stripping completely naked and taking a pompous stone to my legs and my arms. Then I filled the bathtub up with barely tolerable hot water.  My thought process during this moment was that the hot water mixed with the fresh and bleeding scratches and cuts from the pompous stone would make me feel enough to snap me out of it.

It didn't. So I tried to drown myself in the bathtub full of piping hot water and traces of my blood. 

After a failed attempt to admit me to a psychiatric hospital, I was placed on suicide watch for 72 hours. After my parents demanded it, I got an emergency appointment scheduled with my psychiatrist the next day, which my parents also sat in on. Upon further evaluation of the events leading up to the previous day's suicide attempts, my psychiatrist determined that I was bipolar with an impulsive personality disorder. So add that to the mixed bag of goodies I already deal with and here I am, approximately 4 months after my most recent suicide attempts, and I feel it all coming back.

I'm so fucking scared. I'm so drained. Just mentally and emotionally drained. I have no motivation outside of work. I don't spend time with my friends and hardly talk to them, even though one of them probably saved my life through a phone call after I tried to drown myself. My life is spiraling out of control and I know I'm letting my depression get the better of me. My personality disorder and bipolar disorder are both showing themselves more frequently as of late too. 

I just needed to vent. I needed someone else to hear my story and know how I feel because I don't want to scare my loved ones again. ",26Mar2019,5
