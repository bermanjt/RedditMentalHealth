0,"I am too convinced this is happening and just want some truth so I can actually do something about it. People around me say very specific or off the wall things that pertain to what I was just thinking. Like if I think of random names, people will repeat the names I say. Or every time I think a negative thought or don’t want people to react to me, they do. People will sniffle, play with their hair, turn on an intercom, duck, get into my private space and actually have conversations just based off of the things I am thinking.  I’m just so shocked because the chances that people are thinking the same things and the timing of it all makes me know it’s happening but my five senses say I’m not talking out loud. Like people will get on the phone around me and just base a conversation in what I’m saying. When I actually talk, people don’t understand what I’m saying and if I don’t think about it much they’ll respond to what I’m thinking instead of what I’m saying. Several times people have replied to my thoughts because they thought I was saying it. Unless I am hallucinating my entire reality there’s no way people could just say the things I’m thinking. Like entire conversations based off of what was just thought in my conscious or subconscious. Everyone I know does it to me, and people even slip up and say things that are too obvious, but I think they like doing this to me. I’ve sent audio recordings to friends but it doesn’t seem to do anything. When I take videos of myself everyone gets quite and I don’t see myself talking in the recording... I don’t even know. I just want a way to 100% confirm if this is happening. Like any way to talk to someone and make sure this is happening or not.  ",29Jan2019,1
1,"I'm in 8th grade currently, and I'm apparently supposed to have the life of my dreams, when I see others who have it worse, I do appreciate what I have, but sometimes its just too much. 

&amp;#x200B;

After a fiasco in July, We had moved out of our house, and I lost a lot, my friends, my amazing room, and the whole area which I had loved so much, and had given me the BEST year of my life. I would go into detail but thats around 3 paragraphs full. The previous year had its ups and downs, losing loved ones, pets, and amazing people.

&amp;#x200B;

sometimes I just snap. Where anger over the years + anger that day, just overcomes me. I flip out, get angry, throw shit, afterwards I feel like I had just blacked out, not intensely but I just can't remember what went through my mind. Afterwards I just bawl my eyes out and reflect, it's been a weird 3-day weekend due to the end of sem, everything should seem fine. but for some reason, little things do tick me off, I'm very insecure as well, so I usually blame a lot of my flaws or just the way some things work on people, its just unlucky. I absolutely hate myself, the way I look, and sometimes I may even go to where I hate my family, except my mom, but I don't get to see my mom often as I would like. At school I may seem nice, and energetic, but I feel like I'm just suffering quietly. I feel I have some sort of bipolar disorder because at any moment, I would seem okay, but then any little thing that goes wrong makes me wanna just, even kill somebody. I fear I may snap when I have actual power when I'm older and kill someone, its a blind rage that I go through and want to stop. It's a lot of stress and anger, especially today, I got very angry and threw shit, started yelling and crying, I felt legitimately crazy. My mother and I have tried taking me to a therapist but It just never worked out since we forget about it or a lack of transportation. I just want to be normal, but I can't help hating things.",29Jan2019,1

3,"A part of me feels like there might be something wrong with me, but another part of me thinks that I'm simply lazy and not ready to face life. And I'm running away like a stupid child and not owning up to my responsibilities, but then again, life is so much work! Like, I don't want to go through all the struggles and hardships. It goes so far that I wish I was dead. Does it mean that I'm a lazy person?

4,"There's an inconceivable amount of stars in our sky. Each one more than likely has a planetary system, and some of those are likely to have at least sustained simple single cellular life (dont @ me). Our existence may not be as amazing and miraculous as has been romanticised over the centuries. Our own sun is absolutely tiny in relation to many other stars. Nothing we do makes actually any difference in the grand scheme of things, as we're such tiny beings in a potentially infinite space. It's only when we apply meaning to actions that they start being 'significant', and for some reason, my mind wont let me get past 'but nothing matters, why care about anything?'. Nothing truly matters until you apply meaning to it, and it feels like my ability to apply meaning to anything has dwindled massively.

5,"Hi all, thank you for reading. I’ve never posted anything on Reddit before, so I hope this goes well. I’m on mobile, so forgive any bad formatting. Also, I do not know any proper terminology, but please know that it isn’t my intention to offend. I’m truly curious because this might be my own experience. 

I suffer from bipolar disorder and primarily-inattentive adhd. I’m going through a particularly dark time and I’ve sought out help via my normal means - doctors for the most part. Because I’m so down, my DO decided my condition had reached a point that she couldn’t treat me anymore, so I found a great new psychiatrist. I’ve been recommended DBT therapy by two psychologists (one of them is my current therapist) and my new psychiatrist. I didn’t want to do it before because of the intense time commitment, and the cost. This time, things are bad and I’m tired of feeling this way without any kind of coping mechanisms.

I was wondering what any of you who took DBT thought of it. What was your experience? Did it help you, either right then when you were in the middle of the mood swing/episode or in later episodes? What was it like opening up to strangers? What kind of tools did it give you to cope? And most of all, what was the most valuable thing you took from the therapy once it was over?

Anything you might have to say about DBT would be so appreciated. I only want to make sure this is the right treatment for me. Thank you again!",29Jan2019,1

8,"I guess it's best to just start from the get go;

I'm 30 years old, have my masters and undergraduate degree in History, and have little job prospects in the area that my wife and I want to live in. I've been hunting for a job in my field that pays more than 10 or 11 dollars an hour, and unfortunately I have run into the wall that most in my field run into - an abundance of history degrees and due to the state of humanities support today, few job prospects.

I know a lot of people will say ""You should have got a science degree, you should have got a more marketable degree."" I thought about this stuff too late. I was happy to be out of a terrible home environment in my late teens and by the time I finished my degree, I was very optimistic about finding something.

I married my wife in 2015, we had our first (and only for the time being) daughter in 2018, and I finished my masters program in History - thinking that with more education I would be more marketable as an employee. I've had to take jobs unrelated to my field because that's what I had to do to provide for my family. We aren't hauling ourselves over to the west coast for more opportunity, as her family is here and I want to be sensitive to her needs as well - she's much closer to her family than I am mine, and I want to respect that.

Now, I'm 30. Pushing 31, working a part time position at a community college teaching one to two students a night in the continuing ed program. I work in retail during the day, so I'm at around 60 hours a week to provide for my wife and daughter. We're thinking of trying to move to Raleigh in the next year to look for better jobs. My wife stays at home to avoid daycare costs.

I have a lot of debt. My family was poor, and I was financially irresponsible mostly because I thought it would pay off with having a good career at the end of it. Somewhere in the realm of $100,000 of debt along with my wifes.

I don't want my life to be working in a menial job for the next ten years while I just keep searching for a job that may turn up. I don't really know what else to do, though, as I don't have time (or money) to go back to school, and I don't even know what I would go back to school for. For a time I thought computer science or systems, but I just don't know how I would manage it.

I don't really know what I'm asking - is this normal? I don't want to talk to my wife about it because we've talked about it in one way or another before. She's already stressed with our daughter and I don't want to add to that.

Either way, I feel like I might have a mental breakdown at any point. I just want to take some steps in the right direction - I feel like starting over at this point is basically wasting the past ten years.

11," Growing up, I watched my father beat and rape my mother. This happened regularly as he abused alcohol and heroin. I have always known I am different than other people. It seems like my brain shut my emotions down to protect me when I was young and never turned back on. I hardly feel anything, and whenever I do they are very selfish thoughts. This has not been a problem until recently for me. I learned to hide this truth about myself and managed to put on an act for my friends and family to hide who I really am, because I know they would think I am a freak. This has not always worked, and I imagine most of them have noticed something is off about me. Recently, however; I have begun to feel disgusted with myself. I have faced urges to harm not myself, but others. I feel like doing this is the only way for me to feel anything. I am afraid that if I do not get help I will act on these urges. I am also afraid to turn myself in to get help. I still have hopes for personal accomplishment in the future and fear this would ruin my life even more.",29Jan2019,1
12,"Today I handed my notice in to a job I worked very hard to get.

A few years ago I (31f) decided to go back to university with the open university, completely changing careers and doing a part time degree (I won’t say what in to avoid people recognising me) while working a full time job in a bar. 

I was doing really well, despite being a world class procrastinator, with grades in the 80-95% area.

Last summer I got a job in my desired field, entry level but with opportunity to move up the ladder. I was ecstatic, it was lower pay but I was confident in my abilities that I would move up positions swiftly.

As it turned out, the people are difficult to work with, I find the commute hard and they are stalling me learning more of the more technical stuff that was agreed upon when I accepted the position and instead giving menial tasks (I believe in an attempt to not have to give me a raise). My grades have slipped and I don’t have the energy to work harder.

I have always struggled with anxiety but I have had my systems in place to not let it affect me too much anymore. This job has undone YEARS of hard work - I can’t get to sleep, making exercise difficult and I have put weight on, I’m miserable and snapping at my partner constantly. I’ve had to take a lot of sick days as being so run down has affected my physical health and I am no longer the employee I want to be.

So I decided to make a change, some people might view it as a step backwards but I see it as a positive change to focus on what is important. Jobs, money, possessions all that bullshit...is ultimately inconsequential.
All that matters is love, and the relationships you have that fill your life with joy.

It might take me another 4 years to get an opportunity like this again, but that’s ok, I have love in my life.

Stay healthy everyone x",29Jan2019,1
13,"I've depression and anxiety, I'm socially isolated with no friends or family. I can't take antidepressants, I'm currently between therapists but had no luck with therapy.

I started going to a recovery college (peer based support for mental health recovery - classes and groups to teach coping skills etc)...I don't think it's for me. 

Everyone else has more typical mental health issues, like depression that keeps them from getting out of bed in the morning - thus classes teach coping skills, mindfulness, behavioural techniques, etc. 

Things includes encouraging people to do a task they struggle with due to depression then rewarding themselves. Mindfulness meditation sitting focusing on tensing then relaxing different body parts, or tapping different parts of your body and repeating affirmations about loving yourself.

I can cope with my mental health problems okay for the most part, I don't think the techniques they're teaching are beneficial to me.  A big reason for being referred to the recovery college was social interaction. 

Some methods are infantile, and it feels like most students have no understanding of themselves or mental health - it's like mental health 101, while I very much understand myself and my mental health.

Some techniques are fluffy nonsense IMO...I know they do help some people and that's great for them, but they don't help me and if anything it makes me worse by making me uncomfortable. I don't like being made to do things when I see no benefit, I don't want to look like an idiot waving my arms around like a tree etc.

The teacher who leads one of my classes was watching me not participate in one activity, then started explaining to the class that these exercises are 'clinically proven' and it felt aimed at me. I don't like feeling as if I'm seen as being seen as unwilling to participate, but I know what's going to be useful for me and this isn't it. 

I don't know if I should keep going to this one class in particular - I'm two weeks in, there may be some useful points - I don't want to do these ridiculous mindfulness techniques, I also don't see much use to keeping mood journals when I'm already understanding of my mental health...but that means I'm not participating with half the class, it's not especially fair to other students or the teacher. 

I just feel if I continue I'm going to get progressively stressed out by being pressured into participating in this nonsense, but if I drop out I'm only doing one class (which isn't much better but the social interaction is still beneficial). So it'll be another thing that hasn't helped and I'll be back to having nothing to do.

So I’m a 19 year old male in a shit situation mentally and my family only make it worse.

My father is a piece of shit and I’m tired. Today I cried my eyes out cause I didn’t want to go to my cousins birthday song my fathers side of the family is there and whenever I’m around they always push me to get a job and support my siblings and mom because my lazy piece of shit dad doesn’t want to work. Not only that but my grandmother gives him 20 dollars everyday so he can get by on the streets but he sleeps in my moms car. Currently where living with my moms sister and she’s a bitch through and through but that’s for another time. My mom works and is able to afford the rent my aunt is asking for so where in a cool situation but my fathers side of the family always tell me I should work to help out my father but I say I want to go to school since my fafsa and bogfeewaver pay for it so my mom is fine since it doesn’t come out of her pocket. But my grandpa on my dad’s side is always nagging at me to help my dad but last time I told him I want to go to school and he told me “sometimes life is going to be hard” in Spanish and I understand that perfectly but the reason it pisses me off is because he was very wealthy in Tijuana because his father owned many grocery stores but he drank and partied all the money away. 

I already applied to my schools spring semester for 14 credits which will be my first time being full time. But I feel guilty for not getting a job and helping my siblings. Sometimes the things my grandparents,uncles,aunts, and cousins say to me get into my head and I just hurt. I already went to my family doctor about what she said was depression since I told her that since middle school I would hear my parents fight about bills and my dad would trade my PS3 in and get cash and after I would get it back only for him to pawn it by next week and this was the cycle for all my middle school years. I would sell birthday gifts to buy my school supplies and those of my little sister. I love my dad but I always hate him. I’m just tired I guess.

I don't know what day it is I have no grasp on time anymore. Everything is a blur I can't even remember what happened today. I can't love anyone it try to get close to people but I just can't I just push people away even when I want them close. I just want to get life over and done with. So many people have these amazing recovery stories guess what I had one too until that person left in the worst way possible leaving me with even more problems. Now all I want to tell her is why the fuck did she save me just to put me in the same situation again.

I don't know what I want from this post. I kinda wish I had a friend that understood that sometimes I'll go for days never responding to know when to leave me be and when to come down and support me...

19,"So I have a very long story to tell first of all. So if your going to read through it, let me just start off by saying thank you. But anyway, some background information- I am 14 years old and a freshman in high school. I’m going to start from the beginning. During my eighth grade year from October of 2017 to around March of 2018 I had reached my lowest point. I am really into fitness and was keeping up with it which was what makes me happy, but nothing could make me happy during those months. It was horrible, I woke up and really wish I could just sleep all day and not have to deal with anything or anyone. Kids my age claim to be depressed all the time but really don’t know what they are saying in most cases. They think a week of sadness is depression, when for me it was months and I can’t even explain how terrible it was. I vividly remember all of those months. But any way after March everything got better. It was the end of my eighth grade year, I was hanging out with friends a lot and was the best few months of my life. Summer was great, but when high school started everything went downhill. My best friend stopped hanging out with me and every time I would ask him to hang out with me he would just kind of put it aside. That really got to me, and all of the others I knew from middle school found their other “clique” I guess you could say, except for me. That made me an extremely angry person towards everyone constantly and I still am now. But then in December of freshman year I did shrooms (yes I know I am very young, but was not new to this) and shit went downhill. Most of the trip was okay, except for about 15 minutes of it which still fucks me up today. I constantly think about what the point of life is, and thinking life is just an endless circle of a bunch of random shit happening. You really can’t explain the thoughts I have, and it may sound easy to flush out those thoughts but it’s impossible. I feel like I am way to grown up for people my age, I feel like I know too much and know so much shit I shouldn’t know. I’ve lost all my friends now and moved to a different school starting the second semester, (went from a big school to a small one), thinking it would help. But if anything, it was way worse. I’m still an extremely angry person and don’t even know who I am anymore. I feel like I have a matured mind in a teenage body I can’t explain it. I just don’t know what to do anymore.",29Jan2019,1

I still love you. I still have hope and belief in you. 

I know your pain. Your hurt. The deep, deep scars. Only I can truly understand. Because they live with me too. 

I know you’ve tried. You’ve sought help. You really have. You are in such a deep hole. Sure, therapy and such sent a rope down to save you. But the climb up is so hard. Some days you have so much strength to climb out. But then you lose your footing. You just barely hang on to the rope, with every last ounce of strength you have. You hope tomorrow the strength to keep climbing will return. 

Yes, part of the reason you are in this hole is because you didn’t have a good map to help navigate the walk of life. And you could have been more cautious, maybe searched for a different path to avoid this hole, but there will always be ‘what I should have done’ that unfortunately won’t save you today. 

So, baby (because I know how much you love to be called baby), keep hanging on. The days you have the strength to climb, keep climbing. The days you don’t, please be kind to yourself. You’re doing your best. I know you’re working and you are trying. And when you reach the opening, I’ll be here. Even if it’s just a party of one to hug you and celebrate your journey. I’ll be here.

21,"Thanks to this subreddit, I found out that what I’m afflicted with is Intrusive Thought OCD, and I need some tips to cope with it and calm my anxiety when it flares up. It tends to be worse at night after I’ve taken my sleep medicine, and there doesn’t seem to be any way to calm me when I get there. My intrusive thoughts often are things like “maybe I don’t actually love my partner”, even though I am 100% certain that I do. That turns into an impulse control issue, where I fear talking to them and calling them because I am afraid that I’m going to let lose the words “I don’t love you anymore” because my impulse control is so poor that the compulsion feels overpowering. My partner understands this, but I don’t ever want to say it to them. I know 100% that I love them, and that I’m as in love with them as I always was.. The intrusive Thought comes along and I can’t throw it away. I’ll obsess over the thought for hours, going on days and weeks and I’ll be crippled by it and unable to talk to them because of the anxiety caused by this thought and the compulsion to say something. It isn’t always the same intrusive thought, it ranges from that one to intrusive thoughts about other things as well. Telling people things that I never wanted to tell them, and the only way to calm it being by just doing it.

I feel like this Intrusive Thought OCD is taking control of me and close to ruining my relationship. I try to reassure myself that I love them, because if I didn’t, these thoughts wouldn’t be so distressing. I get upset over the prospect of not loving them and of telling them that, and that’s how I know I still love them.

But the reassurances never work, and I always end up being anxious. Are there any tips to help control this sort of thing? I just want to be able to spend time with my partner without always having those intrusive thoughts and compulsions. ",29Jan2019,1
22,"I know I have some issues. Actually a lot. I could talk about that forever. But I can't cry anymore. When I think about it.  There was an incident and after that I couldn't cry. I was really angry in a session with my old therapist but I couldn't cry and felt no release at all. Nothing really let's me let go even for a little while. Socializing and hobbies and things like that may help some people but they just tire me. I will do them and feign interest but it doesn't do much of anything. 

I have a lot of problems but it mostly comes down to that I feel like nobody gets me. Cringey I know but it's true. I feel alone in my head. I come up with ideas about just about everything but how I explain them doesnt make sense to anyone I know. People think I'm crazy or gifted and I dont believe either. In my opinion both words mean ""I dont understand you."" Everything I say gets thrown in either catagory. When I explain stuff it doesnt get interpreted the way I mean, with my peers, adults and therapists. So I've pretty much given up on the therapist idea since they dont get what I mean. I'll talk for 5 minutes about something and then they're like ""So... you mean.... this???"" Which is never close. I end up saying never mind. 

They just end up saying that everyone's different and that rhetoric. I know there's no one identical to me but I dont fit in any groups at school and most people can really be understood by someone like their best friend or something. If I were normal there would be people like me. And I'm not antisocial I've met a lot of people. 

It's no better with my peers. Well I've skipped a grade recently so they're all older than me. But I have never had a close friendship. I can make acquaintances just fine but when it comes to real bonds I dont and never had any.  I just find I work on a different wavelength than other people and I cant really connect with anyone. Well I could pretend but that's pointless. I do have lots of friends just not really close ones.

I have known a lot of people and I have had 7 situations where I've been socially reset. I've had 8 school counsellors therapists and doctors over 4 years and I'm honestly done with that. I've been told pretty much nothing. Maybe I just got really unlucky or something but I'm done with that. 

My mom is a good person but she doesnt know how to support me she'll just send me to another therapist. My dad is always at work and I think he looks down on my mom because she has bipolar and cant work. He has said to me that I have to make sure not to say anything that would stress her out. 

I pretended to be fine to get out of therapy. I have no support system. I dont see a solution. They never diagnosed me with anything but they thought I had anxiety and maybe depression. They thought that because I said my family would be better off without me and just with my brother who's cheery and charismatic and normal. And that I just stress everyone out. I'm not suicidal but if I wouldn't hurt anyone by killing myself I probably would at some point.

Anyways to summarize I have repressed issues and I cant cry about it even when I think about it I need advice pls.

24,"most of my friends would say i'm a happy person. that's because i am when i'm around them. when i'm home, i usually stay in bed, watching youtube. if i don't stay busy, my self hating thoughts get the best of me and i end up feeling like shit. all of this immediately goes away when i talk with my friends. unlike most people, i don't want the school year to end, because then i won't see my friends every day and i'll get sad as fuck. am i depressed? i don't have a diagnosis, but from what i've heard it'd be hard to go from legitimate depression to happy and chill in a matter of minutes. either way, does anyone know what this means?

tl;dr: i'm happy when with friends, but when alone i turn into a self hating piece of shit. am i depressed?",29Jan2019,1
25,"I’m a 13 year old girl, who just started junior high. And let’s be real here. I don’t think any 13 year old should feel like this. Anyways, I’ve been diagnosed with- Anxiety, depression, and OCD. Which I am taking meds for. But nothing is seemingly to help. I’m constantly worrying, overthinking, negative thoughts, suicidal thoughts, depression,and mood swings. 
I as well believe I may have borderline personality disorder. I’m not entirely sure, I’m not one to assume. But after some research, I do in fact have all the qualities to a borderline personality disorder. 
Such as; constant mood swings, I mean yes everyone has mood swings. But as scary as it sounds, my mood changes every 7 minutes. My mindset goes from happy, to sad, to any other emotion, within seconds.
I as well have a unstable self image, as I think certain ways of myself, even though they’re entirely not true. Sometimes I’ll even convince myself that I’m “stupid” or “overweight” or “ugly” or even the stupidest of things.
As well, I constantly feel isolated and bored and empty where ever I go. And no matter what I do. 
I as well don’t really feel any empathy for others, I mean sometimes. But for the most part, I genuinely don’t care. Even though I wish I did.
As well, if I’m in a relationship, I tend to go from loving my partner, to hating them. And basically convince them to hate me, and convince them to say things. So they can hurt me. So I’ll have a reason to get mad. 
I as well from time to time go manic, I will freak out. Usually every 4 months. The last time I had, I had squeezed my eyeballs almost out of my eye sockets, hit my head against walls, screamed, punch myself till I was bruised. Anyways, should I see my psychiatrist? 
And overall, I wish I could be like others. And actually be happy, and not feel these emotions and ways:(
Here are a list of BPD traits, that I have).

Having an unstable or dysfunctional self-image or a distorted sense of self (how one feels about one’s self)
Feelings of isolation, boredom and emptiness
Difficulty feeling empathy for others
A history of unstable relationships that can change drastically from intense love and idealization to intense hate
A persistent fear of abandonment and rejection, including extreme emotional reactions to real and even perceived abandonment
Intense, highly changeable moods that can last for several days or for just a few hours
Strong feelings of anxiety, worry and depression
Impulsive, risky, self-destructive and dangerous behaviors, including reckless driving, drug or alcohol abuse and having unsafe sex
Hostility
Unstable career plans, goals and aspirations

26,"To keep this as short and simple as possible, my family has a history of mental illness, especially depersonalization disorder and bipolar depression. Mostly showing in my mom and recently my younger brother. Growing up I had a terrible childhood, i won’t go into detail but I had an abnormal childhood and it was terrible. I bottled everything in and never saw a therapist or someone while my other family members would, and everyone assumed I was just fine. Here I am 19 years later, I don’t know what’s mentally wrong but I just know something is. I’ve become somewhat suicidal, not wanting to socialize, don’t talk to old friends anymore, and just feel lost and in a dark place. Over the last year i’ve turned to drugs and alcohol just to alter my state of mind and get me out of the shitty dark hole that’s empty, but I just don’t know what’s wrong. I have social anxiety and drugs and alcohol so help a little with it but I just rely on it to get out of my normal state of mind. I know my issues are from bottling in everything for 18-19 years and drugs don’t help but I feel like I have no choice but to be drunk or high on something 24/7.

Today: So Today I went to one of those rich people parties. A Muslim family had flew their private jet and rented a local art museum for a wedding celebration. It was like so rich people they even had those little finger food. It was an actual piece of fish with just a herb on it. Anyway, there was this part where a band they’d flew in came. Everyone was dancing and having fun with the music. I just, didn’t. There was just nothing interesting about the music or anything there. It just felt sorta boring, like, well, everything. Even know things aren’t very interesting. It’s all just a consistent state of dullness. I laugh a bit and this and that but I’ve never actually danced or anything. I can even remember when I was younger just wanting to sit out when my family was having fun. And my mom would have to pull me in or something. 

Friends: I don’t actually have any good friends. I moved to a new town and met some guys I sit at lunch with. We laugh a bit but they don’t care that much. It’s like. We have open campus and everyone’s going out the get food and shit. I can’t drive (I’m in high school but SD driving laws are different), and they just leave without me. I’d like to think they simply forgot about me. But they’d seen me, knew where I was, and most certainly knew I carry around cash. So I don’t think that’s the case. I barley even know anything about them except their names. One girl went on a little speech about her life issues and shit but that’s bout it. I just can’t really talk to people that much anymore. I know what I want to say, I just can’t or it always comes out the wrong way. I always pronounce it wrong or something and sorta justs wants to make me stay silent. I even just don’t care when people gets hurt sometimes. My brother had thought I’d stolen his Playstation controller and attacked me. I hit him in the throat, and he couldn’t go to school cause of the swelling. I knew I should have felt bad. But I just didn’t. 

Anger Issues?: I sometimes get mad at things that other people find weird. My best example was when before I moved and was with one of my school friends, Tyler. I was reading this book I’d just got and he messed up the front cover. One of those annoying bends that you can’t get out. I’d got mad and started yelling for my mom to drop him back at home. It was a small thing, but I’d gotten really mad over it. I finished organizing my room once. Which was new since a lot of people call me unorganized (I don’t agree). But, then my dad came in to clean and put things out of place. I got extremely mad and said he might as well keep the room if he was going to mess things up (he just moved stuff around). I can understand it was ridiculous looking back (that’s the beauty of retrospect). But it seemed completely reasonable at the time. 

Weird thoughts: Sometimes, when something is going on, I just think about what thing I could do that person. Like a kid was playing with a big pack of water bottles out in the snow. And I kept thinking about grabbing one and pouring one on him or throwing it at him or something. I remember a while ago when a girl was being annoying. And I just pulled a pin out a poster on the wall thinking about what I could. I stopped and put it back and didn’t do anything. But, it’s just weird thinking about it now. 

Situation: I live up in the Mountains in South Dakota. Since my mom had to move for her new job. It’s good. She’s got a lot of stock in a company that could blow up. But definitely not right now. We’re living out an apartment on lease for a year. She claims we’ll go back home after the lease is up. But I don’t think we’re going to. I don’t have much freedom. I’m just at home, school, fencing, or some store. I can’t just ask to go outside. Not only because they won’t let me but also because of the perpetual hell-like amount of snow and cold wind. I could get my drivers license. But any spots aren’t open till the summer. So, If I needed help or anything I’d have to go to them. 

Help?: People have recommended that I see a professional or something. But, I don’t know if I really need to. Even if I do, I just don’t know how. I’ve wanted to tell them. But there’s nothing worth they suspecting I need serious help. And if my mom thinks I’m hiding something from her and don’t trust her to talk to her about it. It may just really hurt her feelings. I just want to know if there are other options or how to tell them. ",29Jan2019,1

31,"Hello r/mentalhealth! This is in regards to my friend, so bear with me. We've been friends for almost ten years. We drifted apart with small visits here and there. She's always been too happy. Literally, she takes everything as a lesson. Her dog died, and she was visably upset, but her composure was still calm. She took her dog dying as an experience, and that the dog was much more happier up in heaven, and she pretty much was a back to normal the next day (Although, she talks a lot about her dog's legacy). She is happy to the point where she almost seems dry. She's monotone, but she always smiles and says positive thing. Her humor is dark a lot of times, and sometimes it's as if she's not saying it herself. Overtime, each visit, there would be something a little bit different about her. At first, she'd just say things like how she saw my phone case changing colors (Which it doesn't do that), then she'd claim she her tapping or knocking or someone calling her name. It would be like that until I hadn't visited her for around a year. I had seen her only once (It was a minor hello in the store). She always had a bit of chubb on her, so it was alarming when I did a real visit the next year, and she was thin. She is incredibly short (Being 4'9), and before then she was around 130-140 pounds. When I visited, I can only guess she lost around 55 or so pounds. She also has a mixed speech impediment. (She's had that since early teenage years) ,but it sounded worse than ever. She has trouble pronouncing W's, and she stutters and repeats words often. She rarely leaves the house, too. She isn't too shy, but afterwards of going out, she'll get quiet or she'll talk on how something was scary, and that she didn't trust anything. She also has a soft quiet voice, and she hates loud noises. She does her hobbies, and one of them happens to be sewing, but she puts ears muffs atop ear plugs. She's doesn't even turn up her record player to the halfway point. She walks on her tip toes, rocks herself backward and fowards, and walks about in capes that she akes (In vintage fashion), and she hates it when her family leaves things on when their not in the room (We're both 17). She likes to sit in dark rooms, and she likes to sit and look out at nature (Especially at night) She cleans everyday and even has a schedule that she follows. The only person close to her age that she talks to is her sister (16). She had graduated early just last year, and I think she works three jobs, and that's the only time she leaves the house. She goes to an online college for something in fine arts. She works really hard, but she is a bit out of it. She still smiles and spreads positivity, (Although she laughs to the point of tears at what seems to be nothing) but she gives me vibes that she's not right in the head, and I'm scared for her. Also, she has hydrocephalus (It was treated before damage was done),  but she is blind out of one eye, and she can't drive a car, so she travels on bike. I know she doesn't do drugs or drink or anything of the sort, because she is wholesome. She is the type of person to have immunity to peer pressure, and it would be extremely unlikey, because she is anti-drugs and whatnot. I'm just her friend, but I'm close to her family. Her family is loving, but they just think that that's her being her. Please, is there anything I could do to help her?",29Jan2019,1
32,"Hi guys, so first of all, I really need help, so I'd appreciate anyone reading this and giving good advice. Secondly, the whole story might be long, so I'll try to write only important things. Briefly, I liked a girl, she liked me too (this one I still don't know for sure and it's killing me, my brain keeps asking this question). We did things that in my culture are considered as things only couples do — not sex, but making out and this type of things. But all the time she'd say that we're not dating yet. And then, obviously, we separated because she didnt like me being too possessive and trying to make her to jump into relationship. She's ESFP btw and I'm INTJ. Now few important things about my story. First of all, I met her right after my ex (that one lasted 1-2 months) broke up with me and I was feeling super shitty but right after meeting this girl, I completely instantly forgot my ex. Secondly, I'm an international student in the US and have just 2-3 friends. All my really close friends are gone. I have just 1 guy here who I more or less can talk to about my situation. I have already called local campus psychological service to make an appointment but I need to wait a week until the appointment. I don't know how I'm gonna get through this week. I'm working as a grad student and need graduate this semester, this story completely fucked up my motivation, focus, pretty much everything. I still can work out though, thanks God. Especially, weekends suck a lot, as I think whether I should go out or not and try to bump into her. And I've tried all the things I sent her messages on different social networks, but this last weekend was the peak of my depression: I saw her with some guy, went and said hi and told her that I still think of her and asked her if we can start talking again and she said ""yeah but as a friend"" and then asked if she's dating that guy and she said they started dating like a month ago, but apparently it was a lie because later I found out through her sister and through someone else that she doesn't have a bf.  

Now, the question is why the fuck I can't accept the reality that she doesnt want anything with me and move on? Why my brain keeps analyzing and trying to find excuses to everything trying to convince me that I still have chances? I always thought once I know that the person genuinely is not interested in me, it will be very easy for me to move on. But now I see completely different thing, I see how pathetic and desperate I am, almost lost my self-respect. And keep",29Jan2019,1
33,"Just venting. I’ve been dealing with MDD for 4.5 years, GAD for 10 years and PDD and PPA on top of that for the past 8 months. I’m medicated, I go to therapy and I self medicate with cigarettes (yes I know it’s awful). I’ve been raising our daughter alone for the past 6 months because my husband is overseas. I spent my entire pregnancy alone as he was gone overseas shortly after we found out. I take care of 6 rescue dogs and a cat as well. I have no family nearby, none that would come to help if I asked, and all my friends I made beforehand have moved. I’m completely alone with this. But I don’t entirely mind.

I don’t want a cookie for doing what I have to do or doing what I “signed up for”. But I don’t want to be shit on and told I’m not doing enough from someone who doesn’t know me. Telling someone their best isn’t good enough is a wonderful way to get someone to just give up entirely. I was in a decent place for a while. I felt good about my progress. But then I see a giant mom shaming post and I felt like everything I’ve been doing to worthless. I’m questioning if my daughter would be better off without me. She’s behind (not technically behind but close to it) on some milestones and now I feel like a fucking failure. The whole post was about how it’s basically the parents fault when that happens. I swear I’m doing everything I can I help her. The only “selfish” things I do is eat once a day, smoke during her naps, and sleep. I rarely even shower. I don’t want credit for my efforts but ffs please don’t shit on them. I’m fucking trying.

Adding that I’ve left a message with my therapist and with my doctor (in regards to my medication and considering an increase in dosage) to call me back tomorrow. Thanks for reading this vent. ",29Jan2019,1
34,"when I was 15 I had most likely an eating disorder (not trying to self diagnose but it was very apparent) I dropped to 94 lbs and would starve/exercise/purge and had all the little rituals of an eating disorder. I had recently started going to a high school after being homeschooled since 5th grade. I don’t know when it started but by winter of 2016 I was pretty narcissistic I think and thought everyone was jealous of my body and how skinny I was and how much control I had. I did not get along with my teachers and thought I was way smarter than them. I also thought I was smarter than the students. I would talk about how much I hated the teachers and the fake control they thought they had over their students and suddenly this emo girl who NEVER talked let alone shouted snapped at me saying “well what do you want us to do?” 


I was honestly shocked and speechless at someone challenging what I said and it was only then that I realized I was totally pissing everyone off. I didn’t really stop though and before midterms I was fed up with the teachers, the students and the school and dropped out and began homeschooling again. After dropping out all my rituals around food began falling apart because I was home with the kitchen all day and despite my increasingly frantic efforts I began to gain weight. 

By June I was 116 lbs and I was off to a 10 week summer program at Georgetown University where I would live in a dorm without my parents.  My roommate was this girl who was apparently OCD and had panic attacks which is only relevant bc she wasn’t gonna do anything about it if I was acting crazy. She had her own stuff to deal with and we pretty much ignored each other after a while. She would also hoard food in the dorm and this did not help my food issues. During this time I was super anxious I think but also wanted to hang out with everyone and do everything and have fun and do well in class (and I ATE EVERYTHING).


I went to all the organized events that the program held. I tried hanging out with the other students when I could. I would dedicate my days to hanging out and socializing and taking long walks around DC. I would dedicate my nights to doing homework. I am not sure how much I slept, but I know I dedicated my nights to homework bc I constantly thought of it and prided myself on it. I thought it was ingenious and was delighted to know that sleep wasn’t nearly as important as I had thought. I pulled several all nighters and if I couldn’t make it all night I would set my alarm for 2 or 4 hours of sleep. One day I slept 13.5 hours, but that was unusual. I also drank 10 cups of black coffee a day and ate an average of 3500 calories/ day to fuel this. 


I was constantly eating. Other students would swipe me and my roommate into the dining hall (I didn’t have a meal plan) and me and her would bring bags to fill with cookies or icecream which we would eat back at the dorm (within a day or two for me). I also would buy food wherever I went on campus no matter how expensive. I never went on a shopping spree for non food items, but I think this is because I was too disgusted with my body to think I deserve that.  


I would also say really insensitive things sometimes bc I was always in my own head and SUPER impulsive and did not think about others. 

During this time I was kinda self hating and narcissistic?!? Like I can’t quite remember but I know there were instances of both. I really hated myself for gaining all that weight and completely having no control. I was always coming up with schemes to lose it again but I was too impulsive to follow through.

By the end of the summer program in August I had gained a significant amount of weight. Right after finishing the program my parents, sister and I went on a vacation to see the solar eclipse. I still felt bad about my body but tbh I can’t remember much about how I felt during the trip or what I did. I wanted to go shopping bc none of my clothes fit, but didn’t feel like I deserved clothes. 

By the end of the trip, September 1st, I was 141.3 lbs. I had just moved to a new house in NC. with dieting and fasting and exercising I was 124lbs by November 2017.  During that fall and winter I had crazy mood swings. I could go out on a 3 mile walk feeling elated and on top of the world, and coming back wanting to feel what it was like to exist on the brink of death. I felt I had an energy running through me which would alternate between feeling amazing to feeling self destructive. I often went night without being able to sleep, although this could have been from hunger and malnutrition. I made myself a rule that if I couldn’t get to sleep until 6 am then I could watch a movie. 

When I was feeling good, i felt “high”. I have never been high, but that’s what I would imagine it being like. I told my friend that I felt energized and “my thoughts felt dizzy”. I had quit coffee but by now I was nearing my 10 cups a day again. I would definitely talk and talk and talk. 

When I was feeling depressed, I still had energy, what I called the self destructive energy. At one point I wrote a big post about wanting to exist on the very brink of death, to feel my body decay, and so on. Mostly I just felt like a failure and a terrible person and that everyone must hate me or I am a bad influence and so on. When I had these thoughts is when I started to cut myself as punishment for my misdeeds. One of these misdeeds was that my friend sent me screenshots of texts my (then) boyfriend had sent her and made me promise not to tell him. I promised but soon after I got into an argument with my bf and got super angry and sent him the screenshots. My friend got upset that I broke my promise and the argument with my bf was still happening. I got really upset and cut myself to punish myself for being a terrible friend and person. 

In another instance I tried to tell the same friend a joke that accidentally came off as racist. I felt terrible and later burned my arm bc of it (leaving several bad scars). The things that triggered me seem trivial now. 

By June I had moved to a new house again. I was happy and energetic and was pulling all nighters and not sleeping much. I had all sorts of plans of what to do with the new house. I also really really wanted to dye my hair pink. After a lot of convincing I got my mom to agree to help me dye my hair. However by then we were moving again. My mom told me that before I could bleach my hair I had to get some things from the backyard. Walking through the backyard I saw a tent that me and my sister had set up and stayed up all night in eating Oreos and watching Shane Dawson videos. It suddenly hit me that I was leaving this wonderful house with its lake and forest. I was leaving any opportunity to stay in that tent again. I suddenly felt devastated when Before I hadn’t cared. I immediately started sobbing and when I came inside my mom saw me and tried to cheer me up but eventually we decided to dye my hair anyway. I liked my dyed hair but pretty much felt depressed from June 23rd (that day) until just a few days ago (it’s January 27th 2019). I have done some stuff between then and now, and have even felt good for moments or a day at a time. But mostly I have felt depressed, and much much more so at night. Sometimes I wouldn’t sleep because I could face the thought I had while trying to sleep and would stay up and work on homework. I don’t like doing anything when depressed. I don’t like shows or Music. However, liked watching the same episodes of Buzzfeed unsolved over and over and over again. 

Sometimes I overreact emotionally. Once I found a picture of Kurt Cobain taken in Singapore. I am not the biggest Kurt Cobain fan but I used to live in Singapore. I got so excited about the fact that Kurt visited Singapore and I was like shaking and pretty much jumping up and down. I told everyone about this. Then, and hour or two later, I got super depressed bc nobody seemed to care, and my friends don’t care about Singapore either. I don’t know why I had this reaction


Over the last couple of days I have felt way better. I finished my blanket I’ve been knitting forever. I want to get more done and study more. I want to make plans and hang out. I enjoy things now. And this has literally happened over the last couple of days. I told my mom I felt depressed and she told me to take 2 sam E 1 magnesium and 1 vitamin b supplement/day. I also took 2 HTP-5 100mg for two days and no pills today. I have stopped the HTP-5 and and trying to stop caffeine. Today I had 2 cups of tea and a soda. I have always had anxiety when it comes to going out in public and talking to people so I am trying to cut down on that. 


I am also trying to get a better sleep schedule but I have been typing for hours and it’s 1:40 am rn so that’s not working out to well lol. But I still am gonna try harder in the future. ",29Jan2019,1
35,"First time poster here.

The title is not 100% correct, but I didn't know how to put it into words better. Also not sure if it's disorder, but it's negatively impacting my life and I want to know if somebody else has this mentality too.

Problem: attitude that resting is losing time and I'm not active enough. I don't watch movies or TV in general because I feel uncomfortable ""wasting"" these 100 minutes, even if the movie is good, but I can play video games for 10+ hours straight without feeling bad, as then I am ""active"" and ""doing something"", as opposed to passive movie watching.

Also it's hard for me to go to sleep, I like sleeping but I don't like going to sleep and deciding that it's been enough of being awake. I'd rather scroll reddit or facebook 3 more minutes knowing I will find something funny/interesting, than have 3 more minutes of sleep. Of course, these 3 minutes become few hours, and even if I have to wake up early next day, I will still delay my sleep.

I googled a bit and found ""efficiency disorder"" or something like that, but it's not it, I am not being extremely productive and hardest worker/student out there. It's just that I don't like to rest because I feel like I'l losing time, I don't like watching movies because I'm not being active enough, I don't like long calls, even with the person I love the most, because I'm not doing anything in that time.

I don't think it's internet addiction because if I hadn't access to internet, I would prefer reading books over going to sleep.

Any opinions, advices? Does anyone else feel like it?",29Jan2019,1
36,"Hey there, first time posting here. I just wanted to reach out to discuss something which has been plaguing me my entire life.

I’m 25 years old, but since I was a little kid, maybe 5 or 6, I’ve hated my name. Both first and last. I’ve always wanted to be called by something else. And throughout my years I’ve been informally known by variations of my first name, my middle name and even just other aliases.

I think my initial reasoning as a kid behind this was that I just dislike my first name both phonetically and visually*. It also has never appealed to me with its meaning, and it is very very common. I don’t mean this in a pretentious way at all, but I’ve always felt more individual or special than what my name has me down as. Both my first name and surname are two of the most common names, so I have a very generic name.

In primary school and in high school I had multiple girls with my name, and I even had one girl with the exact same first and last name as me. In university, there were five people with my exact name.

I just hate it, you know? That feeling. I’ve doubted myself all my life and have never felt like I have a real name identity.

Stupidly, I’ve let this set me back in various areas of my life before. Delaying passports or trips or applying for things like jobs and schools because I don’t want to be known by my name and I think “oh I need to change my name first”.

Obviously the key to solving this is to change my damn name. Which I have wanted to for all the years it has been bothering me. And I am committed to changing it.

The problem, and the thing that is so ridiculous and infuriating for me, is that I haven’t been able to CHOOSE a new name!
I have been making lists of names that I love for years but I never actually stick to them. Or I do for a few months and then I think “This name doesn’t suit me” or “I don’t like how it looks written down” or “People will judge me if I have that name”.

I have lost friends and relationships because of this - nobody wants to hang around someone who doesn’t even know who they want to be.

I’m settled in my personality and the person I am for the most part, it’s just the name. I’ve been overthinking this for years and years.

It’s only recently that I’ve realised that maybe all this ties in with my mental health, maybe it’s actually a deeper problem than even I realise?

I have bad OCD (mainly contamination, checking and “feels right” types, with occasional intrusive thought), anxiety and depression. I’ve had these and have struggled with them my whole life.

I wonder now if maybe this is related to my OCD.... Rumination maybe? Somehow?

This all probably sounds really stupid and trivial to most people here, and I’m really sorry. I’m just trying to find some insight or suggestions of maybe how I can move past all this? Like I said I am set on changing my name. I will change it. But how do I settle myself into one choice so that it’s not controlling me and so that I can move on?

I’d really appreciate any comments.

i am Bipolar with suicidal tendencies during my depressive episodes. i’ve been medicated for the last four years.  i started college this year and the transition was not ~~easy. my mental health issues weren’t recognized by my social circle until i was about a sophomore in high-school but by that time, my manic and depressed phases had been drawn out aggressively by alcohol and drugs that even tho i wanted to hide it soberly, they had heard me slur the words either “i am god” or “i want to die”. none of my other friends ever talked about their problems i guess or maybe some of them didn’t really have anything serious, coming from the the poster-child-town for straight white males no one really struggled day to day in regards to physical needs. 

we had 2 suicides in my town that were both HUGE sparks for mental health awareness in the month and a half that followed their deaths. sometimes people joke that our town is cursed, we’ve had 4 suicides, 2 deaths in car accidents and an OD in the last 4 years in a town that is literally a square mile. but hey, rich white people need something to be sad about right? maybe it’s a sick twisted joke like, some of us were just born to be sad because it shows whoever maybe cared about us that life is a fickle fickle thing and it can be gone in a flash 

i haven’t had thoughts of suicide in almost 3 months. i’ve gone through a few episodes during which i sent some suicide-esque memes to my friends but really nothing serious. 





in the last 2 days my best friend and another very close friend have told me they want to die. 

i remember going through episodes at the beginning before i understood it and the first time i ever even THOUGHT about suicide was my first attempt.  i was a naive and critically confused 13 year old but i know that when those first thoughts first creep in that that’s when they’re strongest.

47,"I’ve posted here before but am mostly a lurker. I have anxiety and have had depression. 

The past few months have been hell. I was in a relationship which ended earlier this month. I had a lung infection, continue to investigate what’s wrong with my physically and my anxiety attacks began to worsen and worsen until I was severe physical symptoms.

My relationship was going to shit. It really was. He basically told me that he began checking out months ago because I was “too much”. That me being so sick and so stressed with that and work (I have a lot going on) and him being unable to “fix me” or “intrinsically understandings me” stressed him out.

I didn’t stress him out when I stood by him and helped him recover from his trauma and his bullshit. I didn’t stress him out when I soothed him because it made him sad that I was sick and stressed. I didn’t stress him out when I was quiet and made less jokes and walked on eggshells so he wouldn’t feel less funny or inferior.

No, I stressed him out when I was worried about work and being sick, about my job and my future, about the possibility of cancer that was on the table. I stressed him out when I was tired from being anxious all week. When I asked if we could do something together just the two of us. When I had too many opinions. When I won too many debates on politics.

He told me I was too much, too stressed, to worried, to much to handle and that he’d have to get over himself and give up on certain things (whatever they may be) to continue to love me. But he didn’t want to do that. Because I wasn’t enough, or was too much. 

He told me I was the best thing that ever happened to him, that I helped and healed him until he got better. But that after that he didn’t want to deal with stress anymore, he wanted to go back to being his old carefree and thoughtless self.

He used my anxiety as an excuse to any and all fuck ups and lies, told me I was imagining things. Told me I was just stressing. I was making problems up. That I needed help, pills and more therapy.

Now he admits all my fears and doubts were real. That he felt bad that he couldn’t be the person he was pretending to be and that he lied. 

He used me as a test for his own strength and broke years of work in the process.

I feel wounded, you know? Frayed. I don’t know if I can work all that up again. I just don’t. My greatest fear has always been that I was too difficult to love and I thought I’d found someone who made me safe and he lied to me for months.

58,"ey you buddies. I have a problem with thoughts which are haunting me since I finally got together with my all time crush, woman of my dreams, living definition of beauty. As you can imagine wining her's heart was the biggest challenge of my life. For now, I would like to give you just a TLDR of what happened through my life, and what problem I am dealing with right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I had a PMO (porn and masturbation) problem since my teen ages. Big big problem. No socializing with girls during that time, but still I was a ""normal kid, teen, young adult"", had friends, but no romantic relationships at all, with few events of breaking my heart by small rejections. 

I went to University, there I met her - I totally fallen for her, never felt that way. I was very insecure those days. First year I hardly was able to talk to her, she was from another league to me. You know, she was like that most popular cheerleader girl. She had a boyfriend that time. Next year, I finally got brave enough to ask her out. I've done all my best. But she rejected me so badly. I got into depression for one year. But at my 4th year at my Uni, she came to me, asking if I still have feelings for her. 

This was the best day of my life, I couldn't lie, I still loved her. I stopped PMO right away. She admitted that, she was lost herself when I tried for the first time. She explained herself well. Long story short - year later I proposed to her. She's my fiancee now. We're getting married next December. We're having the time of our lives. 

BUT, sometimes I can't sleep, and I cry thinking about past, about that, she had a few boyfriends, about that, she started her sex-life in High School and I compare my life to hers. I was never into having sex oriented relationship (which she actually had). My problem with PMO learned me that sexual life is bereft of guilty feelings when it's shared with someone who you love, and you thinking of that person as it's THE ONE. My fiancee understands me, we're together trying to keep sexual life for our marriage time. And she supports my NoFap resolution. We are trying, I relapsed few times since I've been with her. **So what sometimes bothers me and doesn't let me sleep are thoughts of her, being with all that guys, being sex-oriented person, being cruel to me 2 years ago. I came to conclusion, that I'm morbidly jealous about her, about her past, all about her. I don't want that feeling. I've forgiven her for being rude to me. But how to come to therms with her past, how to accept the fact she was first (romantically and sexually) to me, but I wasn't first for her. I have to point out that she's very dedicated to me right now.**",29Jan2019,1

63,"I have a lot of problems. I'm going to lay them out very matter of factly. I want your input. 

Since I'm not sure how to begin, I'm just going to make a list of my issues.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Mind is very scattered. Emotional regulation is not stable. One day I feel one way to one extreme, then the next, the other. One little thing can cause me to shift entirely.

\- Cannot feel certain emotions very strongly. Am not able to give people enough love, nor really feel their love for more than a few fleeting seconds. Have never really been able to feel love strongly.

\- Very hard to empathize with people. I think I want to, because I've been told that's what I should do, but I feel nothing. In fact, most of the time I get angry at people for being weak.

\- Violent thoughts and disposition. Did violent things to people/animals as a kid. HAVE NOT IN YEARS.  DO REGRET WHAT I'VE DONE. Still think the thoughts, but do not act on them. I always feel like I have to be ""on guard"", or I'll randomly have odd thoughts of harming others/myself. No compulsion to act on them. Just thoughts. A lot of them.

\- I hurt everyone I'm around. Physically or mentally. Sometimes on purpose, often times not. I have made people close to me break down and cry numerous times because of things I've said. That was not my intended result.

\- Drug abuse. I've taken nearly every drug out there and several research chemicals. All I take now though is kratom, caffeine, and marijuana. (I've smoked weed since I was 15. I've done LSD, 2CB, Mescaline, DMT, marijuana, mushrooms, cocaine, kratom, hydrocodone, oxycodone, MDMA, LSA, possibly meth, Adderall, Nitrous Oxide, Ketamine ((and probably a few others I can't remember off the top of my head))  Point being, I've done a lot of drugs, so I'm definitely altered in some way.

\- Emptiness. I'm so empty. I'm not depressed, I'm not upset, I'm just gone. Gone until I'm angry or momentarily excited/high. I think I also have manic episodes maybe? Sometimes I'm literally bouncing off the walls shrieking and shit, making random ass noises and wanting to start a business, travel the world, and make tons of cash haha.

\- I think a lot of really weird thoughts, and have really weird sleep experiences such as sleep paralysis. I've seen a lot of mind bending things.

\- I have no energy unless a drug gives it to me. 

\- Heavily dissociated, that's typically how I am most of the time. It's like I'm dissociated and then I shift to something, or I may temporarily come back to reality/lose clarity and experience something else.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if this is ranty. I just want opinions on what I should do.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to say this as well:

&amp;#x200B;

I feel, sometimes, like all I can do is try my hardest to not be a bad person. To not hurt or take advantage of other people. I feel dead, like I died a long time ago, but I have to keep going, and I feel almost like a corpse mentally and physically. I just feel dead. Gone. Like the lights are on, but no one is home.  I don't feel human sometimes, I never really did. I don't feel much of anything other than anger. I can feel other emotions but it is very rare.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to hurt anyone else. I don't want to cause pain. I would like to make people happy, but I  often can't find happiness for myself. Something is literally wrong with me, or I was made wrong or something. I don't know what it is, but it almost seems like I cannot change it.

It seems like I was designed to be like this, or something in me is broken and I can't fix it. 

I went to therapy for months and quit the first time I took LSD. The therapist was doing nothing for me. I don't think therapy is the answer, and I don't really trust pharmaceuticals.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this really my life? Are some people just like this?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't care about terminologies or diagnoses, I just want help with the problems I have, but I swear to you it feels like this is my nature now. Like this is how I am by default, and I cannot change my state of being without a drug doing it for me, or something happening to influence it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have moments of happiness, but I have all of these other problems that make it very hard to just stay who I feel like I am supposed to be for everyone else. I keep losing myself to this emptiness and these destructive impulses.

66,"I have suffered with SAD every fall/winter for the past 6 years now. Since it began back in high school and I didn’t really know anything about how to cope with it, I didn’t use medication in the beginning. The first few years, I tried writing down my thoughts and struggles since nobody in my friend group had been through anything like SAD. I didn’t talk to our high school counselor because she was honestly a joke and ridiculed the kids at our school. I was living in a very small town so there wasn’t any additional resources for therapy. These circumstances resulted in me spending every November-March in my room. 
Since it started, it has been getting worse every year. My freshman year of college I tried taking vitamin D supplements and saw no improvement. My sophomore year of college I tried vitamin D and B12 supplements, yoga, and meditation. Still, none of these seemed to make things better. I was discouraged and felt defeated. 
This year I finally decided to see a doctor about getting on some kind of anti-depressant. I had done some research about which medications I didn’t want to take and which I would be interested in trying. The doc prescribed me 150ml of Wellbutrin and I opted for the same dosage of the generic (college student budget ya know) Bupropion XL. 
He warned me that this medication would take up to 4 weeks to fully take affect, but after 2 weeks of taking this medication I felt ZERO improvement. When we had our 2 week follow-up, he decided to go ahead and up my dosage to 300ml. I have been on that dosage since mid December. I felt some slight improvement through the holidays and early days of January, but I feel like I’m at square one. I’m not sure what I should do.

It may be important to note that I am in a fast-paced, ruthlessly unorganized internship at a large company. I have been working there for a year now. I work full days on MWF and go to class on TR. The reason I stick around is because they pay well and there is a likelihood that they will hire me on full-time when I graduate in December. It’s incredibly stressful and my boss is cool as a robot, but it’s in my desired field.

I have a wonderful relationship, family, and friends. Nothing to complain about in that aspect, but yet my depression seeps through anyway. Saturated, thick, and darker every year. 

Any advice is appreciated.

67,"I began dating a girl in my sophomore year of college and was overwhelming happy about it. The happiness eventually waned away when I found out she had a close guy friend, whom had on occasion expressed his fondness towards her. I caught myself in my river of thoughts and immediately voiced my jealous and anxious thoughts with her in a calm and understanding way. She reassured me that nothing was the matter. I decided to also seek therapy resulting from my anxiety and worry over the issue, but it seemed to do nothing at all. The anxiety instead had began spreading to various parts of my life, transforming a hard working, friendly and otherwise outgoing me, into a husk. It eventually became unbearable when she eventually shared with me how the dude had sexually assaulted her once and she had repressed the memory. I was devastated.

My school therapist had advised me to start thinking ""positive"" and reassure myself of my worth, but I had had enough and broke down. My girlfriend eventually decided to cut the guy friend off completely. (We've both had discussions on people who we felt were a threat to ""us"" and have taken steps to limit interactions with the said person). Eventually, I began to settle down. Slowly, the heart racing adrenaline fueled anxiety accompanied by the silencing depression, became a memory. A memory I didn't want to remember.

Fast forward to today when I found out that she had reopened discussions with the dude and seemed to be rekindling the friendship. I brushed it off as me over thinking again in a bid to prevent the destabilizing mental breakdown from returning. A while ago, I needed help on a project and she said she would help... by sending the guy the problem which I was facitng. I was confused. Primarily, because I identified that my insecurity was going beyond reason again. Was she was trying to help? Or are there undertones.

The majority of my depression at the moment is not resultant of the threat that I may be ""replaced"" by the guy, but the fact that the attacks that nearly destroyed my life are back and i am unable to do anything about it. I've read books, studied articles by mental Management gurus the Dispensas, the Eckhart Tolle's and Gregg Braden's, embraced Buddhist spirituality and still remained embroiled in my mental suffering. I need help and I know it.

Tl:dr; My relationship is fueling my anxiety and depression. Am I the problem, and if so how in God's name do I fix it or is the relationship all wrong?

70,"To those whose partner has a mental health issue that still allows them to maintain relationships, such as anxiety, personality disorders, depression etc, do you ever wonder that were your partner “healthy” again, they might not have chosen you, and therefore your relationship is built upon their illness? 

In my case, boyfriend has OCD, depression and anxiety. He confessed he chose me initially because I’m a “trophy” – young, attractive, good career etc– to me this signals his self esteem issues, even though he really came to like me after and our relationship is really good. 

If so, how do you help your partner, in terms of seeing the picture themselves, recovery, and what does that mean for your relationship ? ",29Jan2019,1

73,"Disclaimer: This is long.

I had a really strange experience from 2016 to about mid 2017.

I was told it was ""anxiety"", but it was just so weird and intense, and anxiety is such a generic and widely used term these days, that it wasn't a really satisfying answer.

I'm curious if anyone has more insight.

\~

For 23 years I had lived a pretty happy, care-free, and normal life.

Then one day in winter 2016 I noticed a patch of my skin near my left wrist had gone numb. I thought this was strange and probably should've gone to the doctor, but decided to wait out the symptom, and eventually the feeling came back.

I felt better, however the thought of it still sat in the back of my mind.

Weeks went by, and a sensation started to manifest in my hands. It's very hard to explain the sensation itself, but it started very quietly at first, and as time went on the sensation became stronger.

Strange thoughts accompanied these feelings, thoughts about something being wrong with my hands, or wrong with the connection between my hands and brain.

I'd sit there clenching my hands, afraid that they we're going to stop working properly.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I've always been a bit of a worrier, so I chalked it up to worrying and imagining things.

\~

The sensations became prominent, I began to feel and think about them more and more.

And have strange irrational thoughts. Like that I'd close my hand and my fingers would collapse into an impossibly mangled fist.

The thoughts slowly became more invasive, and I developed a light paranoia.

I'd be afraid I was going to see something that wasn't there. Or be afraid I was going to say something strange. These things never happened, but it was a sort of paranoid, impending feeling. 

&amp;#x200B;

I must of never acted different, no one ever noticed anything. And this was all pretty contained, I never acted out, other than a few hand clenches in my car. 

I've never talked to anyone about this, and I don't think I realized how much this was wearing me out, because it just became an everyday thing. 

\~

This went on for about half a year, until it all imploded one weekend while I was visiting New York City with my uncle We were browsing a clothing store and I felt pretty good in the moment.

Then after a few minutes of browsing, I felt a light-headedness and sort of aura come over me. This was different than anything I had felt previously. 

This is hard to describe but the aura grew stronger, and I started to feel less stable. It started to totally encapsulate me, and I'll never forget this feeling, I felt like every muscle was just waiting to burst out of my skin. I was afraid I was having a seizure. (Doctors later refuted this.)

I told my uncle we needed to go to the hotel, because I felt really weird.

I lied down, and WAVES and WAVES of sensation swam over me. I just felt really unstable, and really scared.

It slowlyyy faded away, and after an hour I felt better. 

&amp;#x200B;

Later that day, I was in a pizza shop. And the aura came back. I felt like the room was going to break apart or collapse inward. It's almost indescribable. It was just fear. And I went to the hotel room, and cried, because I felt so fucked up.

\~

The next day (back home) I scheduled a doctors appointment and went to immediate care. Immediate care told me it was an anxiety attack and to take it easy. Fuck...I thought I was already doing that! 

I talked to like 5 doctors and that had no conclusion for me other than ""general anxiety"" and suggesting I find ways to relax, unless I wanted to take medication...which I didn't

&amp;#x200B;

\~

After this, my life became fear.

I'd feel a LOT of weird feelings and auras like the episode in NYC. 

(Strangely, I'd ALWAYS get a burning sensation in the back of my neck.)

&amp;#x200B;

And relentless invasive thoughts.

Endless thoughts that I'd die.

Of a heart attack or stroke or brain tumor. Or die in my sleep. Afraid to close my eyes, imagining my parents finding my body in the morning.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd be sitting somewhere, and think. 

""What if I'm not really here right now? What if I'm dreaming right now? What if any moment I open my eyes? What if I wake up?"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Or completely irrational bad thoughts. 

I'd see a knife and think ""What if I take that knife and cut myself? What if I just pick it up and cut into my arm? Or cut though my hand? Or stab myself in the stomach? What if one day I lose control and stab someone else?

The thoughts were always about the IDEA of something happening. This impending sort of misfortune.

\~

I started to isolate myself.

I wasn't happy around anyone.

I just sat in this weirdness and dwelled in it.  


I felt confused.  
And disconnected.  
From friends.  
From family.  
From myself. 

This sent me on this exiled internal journey.

\~

Consumed by these thoughts and just confused, I started to lose any meaning in life. I saw no future anymore.

I realized I had no idea who I was and I got rid of everything I owned in hopes for an answer. (Literally everything, this freaked the fuck out of my parents...understandably.)

I deleted my phone contacts.

Deleted all my social media.

And when I'd get home, I'd sit in my empty room hoping ""the real me"" would show up.

(Luckily I didn't turn to drugs or alcohol. But I was afraid that they were going to kill me.)

\~

I shit you not. One day I was there in my empty room.

And I snapped out of it.

I simply snapped out of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing provoked this.

I just had the answer on how to feel better.

&amp;#x200B;

I realized I wasn't paying enough attention to the people in my life. 

And I should start.

&amp;#x200B;

\~

After that I didn't have another episode.

And all that scary shit feels like a memory now.

&amp;#x200B;

Remnants remain.

Like a clothing stain that is barely barely visible, but you know it's there and in the right lighting you can find it.

Since then my hands and feet twitch regularly. 

And I still have health related fears, like getting a heart attack....but they are controllable. And I can push them away.

\~

So curious on anyone's thoughts on this?

Just anxiety?

It just seemed so....extreme. 

And the way it just came and went leaves me a bit anxious to something like this happening again in the future

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading.

74,"I'm a 20 years old male and I have been dealing with this issue for more than 6 years.

Throughout the day, I'll get these negative thoughts that refuse to leave my head. They usually fall under the categories of vast generalizations, jumping to conclusions or unreasonable comparisons. Seldomly, I'm fine with that. I have started to come to terms with the fact that my brain could be an asshole at times and that I can gather sometimes enough reason to not trust whatever it's telling me.

However, what bugs me the most is that, most of times, engaging with these negative thoughts could almost seem tempting. By choosing not think about the stuff that's spit out by mind in its dipshit mode, I get the feeling that I am missing out on something. Maybe I'm not taking into consideration this particular thing when thinking about whatever I'm doing with my life. Maybe I'm not working my mind enough etc... Basically, I'm left with guilt.

In hindsight, the conlusions that I come up to when giving up to the endless cycle of overanalyzing things turn out to be unreasonable most of the times. When I look back at some of the reasoning I made, it seems laughable and I cannot understand how I could allow it to leave me in an unpleasant state of mind. But still, I cannot bring myself to realize how unnecesary it is to engage with these negative thoughts each time they arise.

It's worth mentioning that, during these last two years, I've become more capable of suppressing them by keeping myself busy with work or my hobbies whenever I have spare time. However, this is, either not always the case and I end up giving up or I find myself emotionally/physically exhausted from pushing them away even when I haven't done much during the day.

I always stumble upon advices on how to deal with my issue. And while they seem helpful, a lot of the time they can make things worse. For examle: when I force myself to do my hobbies in my spare time, I end up hating them for a while and refuse to do them for weeks because they're not as spontaneous as I like them to be. Walking while listening to music, although helpful before, doesn't seem to be helping anymore as it only adds physical tiredness on top of my emotional one.

Also, I've also seen that going out with your friends is helpful. It's worth mentioning here that I'm an introvert. Not in the sense that I lack social skills; I think that I can relatively keep a conversation going. But in that I have a ""social battery"" that needs to be recharged with some time alone that I value a lot. So as a consequence, as my ""battery"" level drains, my capacity to resist the ""temptation"" slowly decreases until the social interaction becomes an unpleasant experience instead of a refuge from whatever I was running from.

What I'm getting at is that my methods can be helpful at a certain bearable level of negativity. However, at other levels, these methods can be a hindrance and not serve me any benefits. I feel that I've been locked into this cycle for a long time and that it has been in the way of doing pretty much anything. Maybe I'm locking myself into another mindset with how I'm analyzing it in this post which is why I'm really curious to know what you guys/girls think about it and maybe you could share your experiences. (I'm willing to give more details if asked)

**TL;DR:** My mind acts like an asshole most of the time. I'm constatnly in a fight to resist the temptation of the negative thoughts. Sometimes I win but end up feeling exhausted. Other times I lose and I'm left feeling like shit.",29Jan2019,1

you've been going to therapy for your bipolar disorder for half a decade now, just getting through your first year on a mood stabilizer. maybe it's going ok. you're not sure. objectively... probably not.

you've had a few run ins with the law, mostly traffic violations from wreckless driving. close call with shoplifting, drugs. recently just acquired a DUI. technically the first time you've been arrested.

you dont have a lot of friends. in fact, you only have one best friend that you've seen maybe 6 times in the past 18 months. dont have anyone you talk to on a regular basis. you've dated but are currently single, at least not in anything serious. kind of afraid to get to know anyone because of your past and current situations.

you're still living at home because you have no money, and only make $3/hr that ends up being used to get to and from work. you spend your free time sleeping. or getting drunk. or maybe getting together with that guy you like and have been placing your happiness in.

you're not sure you're ever going to be fully functional on your own. partly independent seems like the best case scenario, but you know that you'll more likely just continue to be a burden to those having to take care of you.

I am scared of not knowing what's happening because of that I sleep with my night lamp on, so when I wake up I know what's happening. I don't believe I have depression because I want to do things and I have the motivation for it, but  I'm just too scared to do it. Sadly I don't have the option of therapy.

Everyday became scary.

I'd be somewhere, having a fine time, and the blanket of sensation and fear would come over me.

(Strangely, I'd always get a burning sensation in the back of my neck when this would happen.)

And the invasive thoughts of before (""what if my hand stops working..."") became relentless.

Endless thoughts that I'd die.

Of a heart attack or stroke or brain tumor.

Or die in my sleep. Afraid to close my eyes, imagining my parents finding my body in the morning.

Thoughts that life wasn't real life.

I'd be sitting somewhere, and think.

""What if I'm not really here right now? What if I'm dreaming right now? What if any moment I open my eyes? What if I wake up?""

Or completely irrational psycho thoughts.

I'd see a knife and think ""What if I take that knife and cut myself? What if I just pick it up and cut into my arm? Or cut though my hand? Or stab myself in the stomach? What if one day I lose control and stab someone else?

The thoughts were always about the IDEA of something happening. And we all think weird things.

But these thoughts always had an impending feeling attached to them. Like the ""what if I wake up?"" idea, felt like the moment was coming, the moment where I'd blink and be somewhere else. The moment where what I was experiencing would be proven false and reality would be broken.

\~

I started to isolate myself.

I felt alienated as fuck.

I felt disconnected from everyone and myself.

And I just sat in this weirdness and dwelled in it.

I was neck deep in this turmoil and I shit you not.

One day I was there sitting in my empty room and I just snapped out of it.

Nothing provoked this.

I just realized how to feel better.

I decided from that moment to stop pushing everyone away.

To embrace reality.

To embrace life.

And to focus externally, less internally.

That's the only way the thoughts would die.

\~

After that I haven't had another episode and all that scary shit feels like a memory now.

I don't feel quite the same, remnants remain. And I'm much more fearful and worried and nihilistic than I was once was.

But I definitely feel free of the consumption I was involved in before.

(Like a clothing stain that is barely barely visible, you can get away with wearing the shirt, but you know it's there and in the right lighting you can find it.)

\~

I feel like a completely different person now.

And legitimately healthy. Socializing regularly, goals, techniques to control negative/intrusive thoughts.

But this all lingers in the back of my mind, especially from the abruptness in which it ended.

Things like that don't just end, it's completely nonsensical.

It gives me the idea it may happen again later in life.

So curious on anyone's thoughts on this?

I have a hard time with relationships as I have very little self worth due to my anxiety. I typically think everyone around me hates me, that I can’t do anything right and I’m just a waste of space most of the time (might have some depression sprinkled in there). 

I do best with people I don’t care about as when I care less about a situation these feelings are not as strong. 

I just started seeing someone who I care a lot about already and I can feel myself starting to act abnormal. I’m doing only things I believe they will like, walking on eggshells, afraid they will leave me, thinking everything I’m doing is wrong. I am able to see now that in my past relationships I end up becoming someone completely different and typically not the person my partner wants me to be but what my anxiety tells me they want me to be. 

I have told this individual about my struggles and although they listen, they don’t have any of the same feelings and therefore they seem to glance over the subject, they listen but don’t really ask questions or seem to want to hear about it. 

I’m afraid to talk to them too much as honestly I’m just afraid as coming off as a crazy person with all these issues. 

I’m not sure if I should be more open about it and hope they understand, if I should not talk about it and work on these issues alone, or just leave them now as my mental health is not yet ready for a relationship.

87,"have you ever woken up in the middle of the night feeling completely unlike your normal baseline self? i mean completely detached from the reality you've been living in for the vast majority of your life. it feels as if though your brain has been completely rewired. you're in the same familiar place, but something is very different- it genuinely feels as if though your life has changed. it can be very refreshing, but also extremely frightening once the big truths (which you tried to shield yourself from all these years) start to flow. it's almost as if though the veil has been pulled away and you're seeing things for what they really are. the lie that society has conditioned you to live in ceases to exist and you're left with the bitter exposed truth. is this epiphany? really no words can do this feeling justice.

i've woken up in the middle of the night to this feeling two- maybe three- times in my life and it always lingered for a few days; very heavy. waking up to this in a dark room can really shake you, because it's like you're not you. the physical sensation of being in your body is still there and familiar, but the brain that's controlling and processing everything isn't the one you've come to know so well over the span of your entire life.

sometimes the insights this rarely achieved state yields are incredibly valuable, but they are also- as mentioned above- extremely frightening. i've lied to myself so much that my internal dialogue-- the one thing that's supposed to be pure and sacred-- has become tainted. i no longer know what it means to be true to myself. i don't know what's real anymore, because even my inner voice is always playing tricks on me, misguiding me. sometimes an objective voice surfaces trying to restore order in my psyche, but it's quickly shut down by the version of me which lives for making bad impulsive decisions which i know will hurt me. maybe that bad version of me was born of my innermost repressed desires... or maybe it was groomed by me to become the version of me that i think other people would best like- i don't know. even just typing all this feels unauthentic to me, yet i continue to do it anyways.

life floats by at staggering speed, not enough time to process it all. i'm in awe of everything, but don't care about anything. the concept of day/night/week/weekend/month/year is meaningless to me- it's all the exact same. goals and ambitions left long ago. waiting for something- i don't know what. indifferent whether i live or die. sometimes i feel moments away from jabbing a knife in my throat or heart or driving into oncoming traffic or jumping off a roof. glimpses of my old ambitions and superficial interests keep me around, hoping i'll execute the desire... but they're really only glimpses and dissipate the moment i ease off that momentary lapse of wanting to go on.",29Jan2019,1

I would have a panic attack before and during every lesson because of him. One day he was so horrible and he got the other girls to gang up on me as well. I was fed up and having a major panic attack so I walked out. I was found shaking and hyperventilating by a different teacher who took me to my head of house. 

I was told off and given detentions. I don’t think anything really happened because of it but it was finally taken a bit more seriously. And because of what I was doing other students decided to report him too. I had reported him in the past but I would always get told off for questioning a teacher. I wasn’t allowed to express my concerns since he was a teacher and I am just a student ‘what makes you think you have any right’ I was told. 

After that I refused to attend his classes and was moved to a different one, one where I actually learned things so that I was able to pass at least. 

He ruined my future and most of my days. I would get panicked when ever I saw him and my form room was in the same hallway as his class so it was inevitable. ",29Jan2019,1
91,"Totally weird, but this works for me.  If I feel a panic attack coming on.. or if I'm suddenly in one, I pop the candy crush music on.

And what's weird is that two different things can happen.  Either turning on the app and hearing the music soothes me... or hearing the music annoys the hell out of me.....

But either way, the panic attack subsides faster it seems.  It's that stupid goofy music!",29Jan2019,2

So a bunch of stuff has been going on and I have become an asshole dick cheating son of a bitch. I don't want to be this person anymore. I started off as a loving caring put other people first and selfless but has changed into something I hate. I have been thinking over the last 12 hours of what I can do other than the obvious.

Today on my way to work I was so sad and hateful towards myself that I wish a transport would hit my car and off me. Last night after the fight I went to leave the house. I said I was going to my parents but what I had in mind was something different. It was a huge winter storm so it would have been easy to say the weather was what would have got me.

95,"Hi All- I wasn't sure who else to ask, so posting this question here hoping someone has insight. I've been on prozac 30 mg for close to 4 years. My prozac is prescribed by a general doctor, not a psychiatrist. (Background: I went to a psychiatrist for years as a teen/young adult, and through much trial and error we found that 30mg of prozac was the best fit for me. It's been easiest in the past few  years to just get maintenance meds from my general practitioner)

Anyway, in the past 3 days I have been feeling extremely manic in a BAD way. Heart racing, hands shaking, short, uneven breaths, mind racing, unable to sleep. I've never experienced this before, and am not sure what is causing it. I've had panic attacks and this is not one. Could the Prozac be causing this? I've taken it for years, so not sure something like this could randomly happen. Any insight or advice? Maybe I should consider weening off the Prozac? Other factors to consider? There have been no other lifestyle changes; no changes in caffeine consumption, and I do not drink or do drugs. Thanks in advance for any ideas!",29Jan2019,1

Living Room Conversations is hosting a virtual meeting about Mental Health on January 31 at 1:30pm Pacific Time. Living Room Conversations are a conversational bridge across issues that divide and separate us. They provide an easy structure for engaging in friendly yet meaningful conversation with those with whom we may not agree. These conversations increase understanding, reveal common ground, and sometimes even allow us to discuss possible solutions.

This conversation will allow you to explore the questions below with a group of other people joining from all over the U.S. (or even other parts of the world!)

\- What experiences in your life, your work or your family inform your thinking about mental health? 

\-Is mental health an important issue in your community, and if so, why? 

\- In your experience, how are mental health issues affecting young people? (If you are a young person, how do mental health issues affect you and your peers?) 

\-Do you think your religion or culture, or some other aspect of your identity or background, influences how you think about mental health? If so, how?",29Jan2019,1
97,"I want to try to keep this short because I’m all over the place right now.

I dropped out of college two years ago and moved back to my hometown. I have worked for my mom for the past year. Between her small business and her new real estate ventures, she is very successful. I was told back when I was 16, I would one day inherit ownership of the store despite having an older brother that is just as capable as I am. So I admittedly got lazy in school because I knew that I would be alright in life despite my fuckups. Obviously, that was the wrong way to think and I should not have been that way and I take 100% ownership for the part of my life.

But since returning home, I’ve done everything I could to change that about myself. And I really did do so. I am without a doubt the best employee she has and do everything and anything that she has ever asked of me when it comes to work. I work my ass for her business and all of the properties she has purchased over the past year and ones that have become vacant that need renovations. So one day, after having a falling out with a roommate, my mother offered me her nicest house for face value and offered to do very nice renovations such as new hardwood floor, appliances etc. And it would be all completely paid for because I had a stock account worth a substantial amount and my grandma also pitched in a little because she has given every grandkid a bit of money in the early part of their adulthood to give them a little kickstart in life.

But this is where is starts to get shitty. My mom has by no means hid that fact that she is a complete control freak. And she has very obviously thought very little of me since I have dropped out of school despite going above and beyond her expectations. So I have lived in that house for about 3-4 months now and it is supposed to be 100% mine and completely paid for. Come to find out later, which I should have caught on to early but I’m young and dumb and thought I could trust my own mom, but she has never signed the house over to me. She still owns the house completely despite paying 5 figures for the house plus renovations. It has been a week long fight to where she finally caved and is getting her lawyer to sign the house over to me which is supposed to be done by Thursday, and I have verified that with the lawyer myself. 

But I broke the camels back when I told her that she has attempted to steal from me and that is something that will leave a permanent mark on our relationship. She flipped out and said that if I really think that then I could go find somewhere else to work and then called the police saying I wanted to kill myself which I would get taken away for since I have had to be committed a couple months ago (because of another fight over her control issues). She has slowly been convincing my family that I’m crazy since I was originally diagnosed with depression, and only depression, and constantly accuses me of not taking my medications whenever I become vocal about her control issues.

Since she called the police, I had to go hide at a friends house until tomorrow at the earliest and I am utterly lost. I’m mostly waiting for my friends mom to get off work so I could talk to her because she has always been helpful for me before. I have no job, she has taken every dime I had saved, and she is probably going to keep the house since the transfer was never finalized. I have completely nothing right now and I have no family to rely on. I don’t want to harm myself but fuck I don’t want to be alive anymore. It has been constant battles since moving back and literally the only things I hated about my life was her. Everything else was completely perfect outside of her choking grasp. I just don’t know what to do anymore and just went to wither away.",29Jan2019,1

102,"For so long I couldn't keep a job. I get bored extremely easily and need constant praise. Once I'm at a job too long and the new is worn off, I feel like a switch flips in my head and I just have to go. Never fails. So one day I got tired of it and said ""Fine, I'll join the military. That will change me for good."" I always believed it was a last resort, but now that I've done it for a few years I realize that it can't fulfill me. It can take me so high and then that just becomes the new standard and I feel unfulfilled again. As if I'm a failure if I'm not moving extremely rapidly upward.

Same thing with exercise, or reading the Bible. It feels better knowing that I know the solution, rather than feeling like I've done everything I can and I've exhausted all my options.

I'm a religious man. I know I can only truly be fulfilled in God's plan for me and I feel like I can always rely on it, but I can't stop doing this to myself no matter where I go. I always want something new. I just want to feel like I'm normal and that this is something I'll grow out of.",29Jan2019,1
103,"I don’t even know anymore, I’ve felt like this for so so long and I’m so tired of it. I can’t go longer than a week or two without feeling so horribly depressed and when I am feeling okay sometimes I go crazy and do fucked up things and hurt myself and see things and I can’t sleep and it’s fucking me up so bad. Sometimes I’ll go from being crazy happy and thinking life is beautiful and everything’s beautiful and I feel like doing so much to getting depressed and lying in bed and just doing nothing. I get mad and angry really easily and I’m ruining relationships with everyone and my grades are dropping and I feel hopeless at this point. I think about killing myself often and I’ve tried at one point but it didn’t work but I’m just so so tired of the cycle and it feels like the only way I can end it is by taking my life. I just wanna know what’s wrong with me, I want help so badly but I don’t know how and I feel like even if I do get help what if they say nothings wrong with me?? Then I’ll probably feel worse because I won’t know how to fix it. 
I just feel like I’m getting closer and closer to either ruining my life somehow or killing myself and I have no clue what to do

105,"I am a university student who is very depressed, that I know for sure. Other symptoms follow with lack of interest, sleeping 14 plus hours, always being tired even with a 'regulated' sleep schedule, and barely being able to take care of myself in any aspect, including health and school work. I am not going to entirely self diagnose, but these symptoms are definitely indicating that something is very wrong with me and I need to see a doctor. Plus, I want to be the star 4.0 student that disappeared years ago.  I feel like a witness to my own life, not in control of it. I am watching myself fall apart.

106,"I am sure this has been discussed countless times in here. I seem to attract those with an affinity for “Injured Birds”, and a desire to save them. All of my relationships seem to come to a head within a year or two of them beginning. It is really hard for me to let people in without pushing them away, especially when they start to experience the chinks in my armor (when dating I generally try to warn them of my complexities). I have PTSD which leads to other conditions, such as anxiety and sometimes manic depression. I usually attract those with good heads on their shoulders and a good future in sight. I never feel like I am enough for them, or that I can maintain a relationship. So I end up hurting them before they hurt me. I read “The Body Keeps The Score” and it helped me to once more identify with all of the life events leading up to the person I am today. A long line of emotional and sexual abuse. An emotionally unavailable family. Little to no friends. I am ashamed with the ways I have lead my life and treated others. I can not remember the last time I felt truly happy or mentally stable. Sometimes I have felt as if I was on the precipice of a new beginning, of true change... only to be smacked in the face by life or my own self sabotage. There are so many “self-help” options, even without being able to afford a professional. I never seem to hold the concentration for that, or even day to day tasks. Everything combined causes my heart to fall low and my mind to wander to dark places. I do not want to be in a pity party. It breaks my heart even further to imagine others out there who have it much worst and actually have no way out of it.. this makes me beat myself up more for wasting so much time wasted, or in my head about things.

107,"I recently escaped domestic abuse in a U.K. student house. I paused student loan payments and took time off from university.

My mental health is extremely poor as a result of this domestic abuse by my ex partner.

I have a lot to pay in rent payments after ending tenancy early to escape him, but struggling to find a replacement tenant the landlord agrees with. I am liable for all the weeks it takes to find a tenant.

My anti depressants have been stopped as my doctor says I should find another doctor closer to my house at home, and when I went to sign with the new GP, they stated it will take four weeks to sign me up and to find me my first appointment. They have no online services. There are no other GPs near me.

My best friend died two days ago, to suicide.

I am contemplating suicide as a means of getting out of rent payments and of escaping my ex.

The payments are far too much for me to pay off with my wages. I can’t take money out.

110,"I have no one to vent to.

I have no one to just cry to, no one to give me a big hug (something I really need right now). Nobody to give me reassurance.
Youre maybe thinking, what about her friends? Family?

My mother will claim I am attention seeking, whether I have a stomach bug or Im drop dead exhausted (as I usually am after work) my mother doesn’t think my well being is as serious as my siblings, she will ask me to run errands such as cleaning or go to the shops for her and take it personal if I say I am not feeling very well, it puts me off wanting to talk to her about my suspected depression.

My siblings and I don’t talk about that kind of stuff. Period.  We just weren’t raised in that kind of household.

I could potentially talk to the guy I’m seeing but I don’t want to scare him off, I’ve tried talking to him about being stressed about school but he has told me to just , to put it bluntly,“suck it up”. I know he means well and is trying to toughen me up, I’m quite a sensitive person and his tough childhood has made him seemingly cold.

I actually have spoken to my friends in the past about feelings of depression, in the beginning the listened and tried to offer their advice but I just didn’t think anyone understood how deep my feelings of emptiness went; it was difficult to describe as I couldn’t put a finger on what was wrong specifically when they asked. Nowadays, when I say I’m sad they make a joke of it and ask when am I ever NOT sad.

I’ve tried to convince myself I only need myself and have tried to write in a diary but I feel as though I really need someone to just be neutral. This probably sounds like a therapist (something I should probably look into) but I’m under 18, and my parents (being African) don’t really take mental disorders seriously and wouldn’t allow it. Plus, how could I fit it into my busy life? Working two jobs and at full time education?

I know there is something seriously wrong with me and there’s no one to help me, i feel very alone and while depression is something that can be treated, i can’t help to feel like i am going to feel this way forever.

Every time i read a news about politics, every interview, every article about my country political circus make my floor crumble a little bit more. Every time sameone of them do or say something incredibly stupid/fanatic/pseudoscientific (or all of them at once) i can almost see the ruins of my future.
