1,"Hi everyone I have just made a petition trying to Make therapy free for Australian youth suffering with mental health issues for this to be effective we need 10,000 signatures for the Australian government to respond and 100,000 signatures for the petition to be considered for debate in Parliament. I know it seems like a long haul but if everyone shares and signs this it will slowly get around the internet and hopefully get too Parliament.

I'm unemployed, I'm in the negatives in my bank account. I have nothing. Even if I got a job this second, or sold my stuff I'd still need a couple weeks before I could even save up for therapy ; I'm so far behind on bills, I need to buy food.

This is all my fault. I put myself in this position by being mopey 'n shit for the past few months, by spending my money on food so I could binge. It's all my fault and I despise that fact. I despise *me*.",16Jul2019,1
4,"I think my SO of three years and I are finally done. I'll be concise and show both sides, as I plan on being active in the comments. First off, I've always been depressed and a little angry on the inside, a lot of people are, but mine mostly comes out when I drink. My SO has quite a temper as well,and they never ever back down from an argument, but neither do I, so it doesn't work well sometimes. I have never raised a hand to her, and never would. I have, however, smashed some of my possessions, and put my fist through a wall more than once. Last night was too much. Ever since she got her new job, she's been going out a lot without me. Fine. She also makes a point of not telling me when she is coming home, okay, fine. Or where she is. Fine. Or who she is with. Okay fine. All of these together for about three weeks now? Not fine. So now I goofed. I got drunk, yelled my feelings at her and smashed the door. I don't think she's gonna come back. Idk what to do. I told her (and I mean all of it) I'll stop drinking alone, I'll stop drinking so much, and I won't yell anymore. But I don't think it's gonna fix anything. I think that despite what I'll do to change, she isn't going to do anything. Still no texts, still no heads up, not one peep about what she got up to while she was gone. I think this relationship isn't working out, and that mortifies me. It took a year for me to finally open up to her, and for us to start dating, as I was in such a bad place. She doesn't take it seriously, she isn't there when I need her. I hate being so clingy and I'm starting to think she hates it. A woman's throat got slit by a no one today, but somehow me vaguely knowing where she is/who with makes me a misogynistic asshole who doesn't need to know her business. I know the term gaslighting has been used before but I don't want it to be that. I want with every bit of me to believe she is being faithful, and still cares. A lot of me is pretty sure she doesn't. These three years could fill a fucking novel, so please, question me roast me, whatever you want. I'm lost, sad and alone. Nothing you say is gonna be worse than how I see me, and I doubt I'll be happier out of this. I just really need a distraction while I wait here.",16Jul2019,1

 - It's Summer and With Nothing to do, My Mind is Fucked Up


So a little over a month ago my grandpa got diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. Everything has gone down hill from there. The days after we got the diagnosis I was a wreck. Crying everyday, suicidal, questioning what life was even for. Then I signed myself up for a week long overnight camp with no phones or contact to the world. I was hoping it would distract me and keep me busy. I made some bad decisions at camp (not going into much detail because it distresses me) which resulted in panic attacks. I visited my grandpa the day I got back from camp, but the atmosphere of the hospital along with my panic attacks made me leave early. I have been stressed and sad and anxious about everything but at the same time it's caused by nothing. My period was 9 days early which apparently could be caused by stress. I am debating living any more. What's the point of living if you're just going to die? Why do I want to watch my grandpa suffer if I don't have to? I've been sleeping 11 hours a night but I'm hoping thats just because I'm a growing teenager. Part of me wants life to be over so I can see what's on the other side.  Anyways sorry for bothering you, thanks for listening if you read this.",16Jul2019,1

7,"I think my depression has come back with a vengeance. In the past I went to therapy but it was unsuccessful, and I later tried two additional therapists. Some days I think I'm ok; I think I have it together and I always get what I need to done. I always deliver. But I think I need someone to tell me I'm not ok and I need help. I spend my days alone, talking with no one but my parents and sister (and it's usually less ""talking"", more them criticizing me or barking orders). I feel empty, lost, and suicidal. My long distance boyfriend has been my sole saving grace. I just feel at the end of my rope. I can barely get out of bed; I dread waking up. I look like shit. I can't look at myself in the mirror, and I've thrown myself into baking in an act of desperation (though I'm enjoying it). My dog doesn't even like me; when I sit next to her, she gets up and goes to the other couch. As a small example of what living at home is like, today my younger sister mocked me for having ""no friends"". Another is my parents life philosophy that a life well-lived is a life of work. If you're happy though, you're not working hard enough, and you're not supposed to be happy. Basically, life is supposed to suck, get used to it. I feel like, why do I bother anymore?

&amp;#x200B;

My dramatic decline I think has also been triggered by:

* The instability of my chronic illness (cystic fibrosis)
* Loss of my single passion
* Got a dream job which turned out to be an absolute nightmare where I was overworked, lied to, verbally abused, deprived of food, etc.
* Beginning to resent my major
* Finding out that I can't ever really leave my country even though I hate it here (due to my health condition)
* Losing all direction and vision for my future, now having to reexamine my career options and realizing I will never be as financially successful as my parents
* Back in February escaped my ex who abused me sexually, emotionally, verbally, mentally for roughly 2 years
* Living with my formerly abusive mother who I'm still afraid of (but cannot leave for a long list of reasons)

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is, I don't want to spend money. Additionally, I don't want to tell my parents I need help because they'll read it as a kind of vulnerability and weakness, and they'll take advantage of that later. I am also chronically ill and have taken a large amount of pills my whole life; I don't want to add to the pile. And most of all, I don't want to be hospitalized or put in a psych ward. All in all, I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.",16Jul2019,2
8,"My therapist told me I'm co-dependent on my mother. My mom is bipolar and I have spent a good bit of my life taking care of her, but only because I'm in the best position to do so. I'm the eldest child and my dad works too much to be home. I've never heard co-dependence in this way and I'm still a bit offended. When I hear her say I have a choice to not help my mom it takes me a moment to process, as I have never felt it was a choice. I'm not sure what to do. I feel I am progressing with this therapist, but the ""label"" of co-dependent still bothers me.",16Jul2019,4
9,I sit in my room and scroll instagram and reddit all day. I have no pastimes or hobbies and can't afford any because I'm 15 and can't find a job for the fucking life of me. I despise my life with a passion and want to destroy everything surrounding me.,16Jul2019,3
10,"Just to preface, I'm regularly thought of as funny and upbeat and thoughtful, etc. I'm told that I'm good looking, I have a girlfriend, and I don't have any really REALLY traumatic events from my past.

In the past two days, I cannot bear life outside of my bed and cannot stop thinking about suicide, especially suicide in a public place which is really really weird to me.

I work in education and am taking the summer off. I write and draw and work out regularly. I normally eat well, but have eaten very little today.

Financially, things have been fucked but normally this doesn't affect me. We had a fire in our building a few months ago, lost all our things to smoke damage, and I was the only one working at the time. Getting a new apartment, new belongings, and everything soaked up my entire savings (only about $5000) which was the most I've ever been able to save (am horrible with money), but I was happy to use my savings in such an emergency.

The stress around this situation had really been taking a toll on me back in May, but I bounced back really strong, I felt. Being a first year teacher (I'm 32, btw, teaching is like my 3rd career), I had a lot to distract myself from my out of work situation and honestly caught some really positive vibes from the staff and booger-eaters (my students) regarding my situation.

Now in July, I just feel totally lost. I feel like my girlfriend and friends don't get me. I feel like all my hope and ambitions are pointless. The world is toxic and full of fake people. Nobody cares about anyone else. We all die alone shitting ourselves.

It's really all just overwhelming for me, and it feels like it's all hitting me at once. I did have some sad times in high school, minor cutting over a girlfriend but that phase didn't last long.

I'm just sad and scared and I know people go through this and come out fine on the other side but.... fuck, it really seems insurmountable.",16Jul2019,2

14," 

Hello and welcome, this is the first of many blogs, posts and content that will be published on different mediums and hopefully it will be insightful and applicable too many. The reason I am spending time writing blogs and creating content is because I have learned that one of my goals in life is to raise awareness about the difficulties of being raised in conflicting environments as well as the impact that can have on that individuals mental health. The other reason is that I love coaching, teaching, mentoring individuals and enabling them to maximize their worth. What I have recently learned is that being different and unique is more than okay, it can actually have numerous benefits to an individuals growth and adaptability in different situations. 

Before I can continue, you may be asking yourself what prompted a person to take on a task that can’t be technically “completed” or have a monetary value associated with it. Trust me if you know me, you know this isn’t a typical endeavour I would participate in or take up, but after reading the book “Grit” I have begun to realize that I wasn’t just put into my situation to do what I am best at, but rather what I enjoy, and what I enjoy is learning and spreading awareness. Also, I have recently returned from vacation and have a better understanding towards the lack of awareness of growing up in two different environments, two different, families, two different cities, two different ethnicities etc. and the impact it can potentially have on an individual. Honestly what triggered this is the final dinner I had with my family and friends on vacation, and (arguably one of the smartest men I know) asked me a unique question during the topic of racism, “I know externally people deem you as Black or African American however which do you identify with more?” This question made me think hard for a bit and then I realized there is no singular answer for this question. If I don’t grow and evolve and my perspective of life doesn’t change along my own personal journey then am I truly living or am I just on auto-pilot? 

Some of you may be wondering how I answered this or why this triggered me. Before I provide you with that let me provide you with a high level summary of who I am and you will then realize why this question stumped me. 

My name and who I am at this time is irrelevant due to many different reasons. However I can tell you in due time I will give you a face and a name to associate with these stories and content. Why will I not give you an identity? Well it is quite simple, if you don’t know me you probably think I am not revealing myself because I don’t want my story to be associated with me or that I do not want to be perceived as weak. But realistically it is the complete opposite, the people who truly know me know my story and know that I am thinking of the bigger picture. 

This question can be answered in two parts; first I don’t want the issues that I will discuss be associated with a single entity, my story can be altered and mirrored in another individuals life and I want to incorporate their stories throughout this story telling journey. Second I don’t want people to think I am doing this for recognition or to attract followers etc. I want people to know that there are others out there who are going through the a similar struggle and may feel lost or directionless, and I want to provide them with a medium to relate to. However as this adventure continues and I feel at the time it is appropriate for others to know who I am, it will be shown at this time.

As I mentioned, my name is irrelevant however my story is not. The reason being is that my story and life has been very unique and needs to be told. As I mature and grow I have begun to realize how applicable my life story can be in parts of other individuals lives and that I was born for a greater purpose. The amount of puzzle pieces that had to come together, and events that had to happen for me to be here today is mind-blowing and as I go each piece will be revealed (purposefully and accidentally) but for a starting point I am a 25 year old male who has a university degree and graduated with honours, has worked in sales since I was 17, I have three siblings, I live with a Kenyan roommate, I have no debt and I have a wonderful girlfriend (who will most likely help me with this). This seems typical for any 25 year-old and you may be asking yourself at this point, “this kid has had no fucking struggle, why all the buildup and who does he think he is to discuss these point.” Well let’s put it this way, if you were on my instagram this is most likely the conclusion you would have come to. But underlying all of this is a struggle with mental health, physical health, and to be blunt a pretty confusing upbringing. First and foremost I was an accident child, created because of a malfunctioning condom that ripped. My mum is the palest of whites and ginger, whereas my dads nickname is “darkness.” My sibling relationships are also just as confusing as my biological makeup, both of my sisters are half-white and half-black (my dad likes the whites) and we are all a year a part. The youngest is 24, I am 25 and the oldest is 26, we all also have different mums and different upbringings and we met my younger sister by accident (I will expand in a different blog). My little brother, the light of my eye, is 15 and we have the same mum but different dads. He is white and ginger and looks apart of the family, whereas I half-black, am tall, tattooed and do my own thing. Everyone knows I would take a bullet for my brother, but you must acknowledge that this would be all very confusing for a young child who does not know which race he identifies with.

*\*This will all be discussed in a lot more depth throughout these posts\**

By the age of 14 I was drinking, fucking, smoking, partying and my athletic journey was coming to an end. My life was a contradiction, I had seen the lowest of the low by the time I was 10. My family had money and I was living in the white-suburbs with people who had been catered to all of their lives. They have never eaten at soup kitchens, seen people robbed, heard or seen gunshots, seen dog fights, didn’t know when their next meal was coming etc. While I was growing up I was going back and forth between these lifestyles, as my father lived in hood of the city and my mum lived in the suburbs. This meant that depending on who I was with I would act in two different way but because of this I lost my own personal identity, which I have slowly begun to recapture. But because of all this I never truly related to anyone and always felt like an outsider, and this lead to using substances to numb my pain and internal struggle. 

During this time, looking back on it now, I was also struggling immensely with my mental health. However while I was growing up I would say I was a victim of toxic masculinity or it had an immense impact on my life as I was unable to discuss my emotions and figure out how I felt and verbalize my internal struggles. Being honest, I thought it was just hormones and growing up having these conflicting struggles but as it turns out it wasn’t and well here we are. Now most of you may know that people who suffer with mental health generally turn to drugs as a way to escape their perceived reality, or being self-mediating because they have acknowledged their own struggles but others will not listen and help you with your struggle. But I began to use heavily in university which resulted in an “accidental attempted suicide.” Which just means that subconsciously I was taking drugs and living recklessly as I had lost the will to live and be around others essentially. This all resulted in me going to rehab in my final year of university and still graduating with honours that year.

Other little things that will be discussed a long this adventure is the lost of my longest friend to suicide, who is now tattooed on me, the suicide of my best friends dad where I was actually with him when it happened and still went and wrote two exams the next day, dating a controlling woman who wanted to retain all power over me, and struggles with authority and my parental figures.

This has been a lot of information for me to discuss in such a short blog so I am going to end this post now and conclude it with this last paragraph. As much as I have stated that this to help others I will acknowledge that this will be very beneficial for me as well, and as I have matured I have realized that yes at one point my life and mental health were complete shiet, but I was able to overcome my struggles and am now quite successful and happy. Understanding that I have struggled and have overcome it, and am open to discussing my issues will hopefully lead to a further understanding about the impact of one’s environment while being raised, struggling with drugs, perseverance, and if it can just help one individual then this will have all been worth it.

All in all from here on out I will be focusing on a singular aspect of my life and expanding on it, as well as bringing other people in to tell their story and provide some external context as to who I am. 

Bye for now!",16Jul2019,0

17,"I go to university in England and do not enjoy it. I don't learn anything from my lectures, I don't get adequate student support, and I don't get along with my peers. I changed course to Philosophy from Maths after the first year, and last year I was depressed and unmotivated and didn't attend exams or submit any essays, so I have only completed 1 of my 3 years in 3 years. I haven't told my parents how my last year went and I feel guilty about that as well as wasting some of their money and wasting my own time. I have also been undergoing a diagnosis for a mental health condition which after 3 years is back to square one. The main suggestion is that I may have Aspergers syndrome and/or Adhd, and not knowing what it is makes me feel uncertain and confused. So that is the background as to why the 3 years at university have been the worst of my life. So I have realised that I think I want to drop out. I am worried about how to tell my parents as I don't think they will approve, and I don't understand the financial implications of doing so. I am also worried that I have limited skills and my mental health concerns will persist making it difficult to be productive.

It’s not like sobbing it’s just I can’t stop tears from falling and my nose runs and my voice shakes, then if I try to talk it makes me continue crying. I don’t do this on purpose and I get so annoyed when my boyfriend or my dad say “why are you crying? don’t cry” Why would I or anyone cry on purpose? I didn’t realize that people could control their tears, I mean obviously some people can keep themselves from doing it better than others, but it’s not like a switch for some people right?

I got allergy rashes, asthma attacks &amp; worst form of cognitive impairment I could ever get. Rashes resolved but I went from to college topper to fired from the course. I don't have degree or job. I can't drive a car because lack of mental co-ordination, can't speak spontaneously, I read a sentence 10 times &amp; don't get the meaning, I can barely get my eyes straight at the sentence, I can't write or text correctly, I can't run continuosly for some distance without high Breathes, I can't keep anything in memory or store. It's like a near Alzheimer's disease. But my creativity has grown up exponentially.

6 Years passed &amp; I can sleep 7 hours a day. Overtime my mental conditions have improved very slowly without myself noticing it. But I passed just only 40% of the path on the pursuit of getting normal. I was very obese &amp; high on appetite. Now I'm normal &amp; on near medium appetite. I think that it takes many more years to become normal as i have to compensate for the sleep I didn't have for that long period because it takes 10X the time of the period of sleep deprivation for the compensation of sleep.

I'm 26 &amp; it's obviously the most productive age of everyone. I don't want to lose the most productive years. I want to quickly compensate the lost sleep &amp; get back normal. I have a life. Meanwhile I found this interesting article:

The house would be a wreck, there would be trails to get to places.   It looked like an episode of hoarders and it smelled every bit as bad as it looked.  At my young age, I thought this behavior and lifestyle was normal.  At around 8 years old my grandmother adopted me and got me out of that life style.

My absolute biggest fear is me ending up like my mother.  I’m kind of a messy person, and I have to actually put a lot of mental effort into keeping a clean house.  I’m not dirty to the point of paths, I’m more dirty in the sense that I often don’t wash the dishes after dinner, I wash them the next day.   Or sometimes it takes me a couple of days to fold laundry.  I’m constantly at war with myself about being negligent about small house chores just because of the way my mother is.  Instead of thinking I’m just lazy, I automatically feel as if I’m going crazy.  I don’t want to feel this way.   

When I told my grandmother (the one who adopted me) that I was pregnant with my 2nd child, instead of congrats or yay, her response was “who is going to take care of the kids?”  She is basically expecting me to be like my mother, which makes me doubt myself even more.  I’m having trouble putting my thoughts into words.  Im extremely scared that I am going to end up like my mother. 

  For the last month or so I have been driving myself up a wall trying to figure out if I’m going to end up with schizophrenia.  I just keep thinking about the things I went through as a child and literally cry because I don’t want that childhood for my kids.  I have thought to myself that if I end up being mentally ill than I will kill myself to get my kids out of misery.  (I’m not saying I want to kill myself, don’t take that wrong).  I need comfort, I need someone to reach out to me that has a family member that is schizophrenic or something similar.  I’m sorry this is so long.",16Jul2019,2
28,"About 2 months ago I discovered MGTOW/blackpill etc etc. Funny enough, my short term (very short term) gf at the time was introducing me to incels, MGTOW, dead-bedrooms, etc. She showed it to me as almost a mocking kind of way, and at the time, I laughed at it. (this was about 1 year ago). I have been single since then if it's worth noting.   


2 months ago when I looked back on the black-pill stuff, and I detested the sheer amount of hate in the incel forums that they had for others. However, belevining that my entire life has already been pre-determined by the structure of my face and bones really REALLY struck me to my core.  


No matter how much I compulsively exercise, track my calories, do my hair properly, etc, I will ALWAYS be glared at by my female co-workers. I will always be seen as inferior, etc etc. Atleast that is how I perceive it. I genuinely followed this black-pill rabbit hole for 1-2 weeks, to its logical conclusion that my only option is to kill myself. to opt out.  


I do not see a way out of this. I feel like I have finally seen the truth, and I believe this to my core.  
I believe the sun will rise tomorrow, birds will chirp, and I will be looked at like a freak. My only use to society is the labour and money I can provide it - and that is IT.  I wish I didn't feel this way, but I have, for the year atleast, with the black pill just cementing it.

(Sorry if this post seems unorganized)

Lets start with the fact that i have 
anxiety and low self esteem that makes me think that nobody likes me,that when people are nice to me its just out of pity and Second guess every social interaction.At school i felt like my self esteem was growing but now that its summer it has gone way down. 

Next i felt like i had a social life during school but now that its summer i really only talk to one or two close friends. 

Next i dont have anyone close to me i feel like i can talk to. My parents have created a relationship where i dont feel comfortable talking to them and my friends either are dealing with thier own issues or wouldnt understand. 

Finnaly i sometimes wonder what its like to die. (I dont want to commit sucide im just curious what it would feel like)

I'm writing this instead of a Facebook status reaching out to people I know. I feel like I've sort of exhausted my support network, and it's midnight where I'm at. I feel like whenever I tell someone I know about what I'm dealing with it's too much. My doctor even seems like they're at their limit.

I've been in a real funk lately and have hit rock bottom in certain regards. I recently just got out of a long term relationship. After that ended, I made some choices I really regret. I'm trying to find a distraction so I don't make another one.

i get pissed off at the simplest things and sometimes deal with them with violence either on myself or something else ( ""something else"" will be explained in a bit) i tried to deal with my anger by punching myself in the fotearms or thighs (and the little bump thing comes out) or by punching cement or wooden objects but I stopped.
id get pissed at little things like my dogs growling at each other and id kick them or punch them. it used to be alot worse but I've kind of calmed down I'm not really sure how.
when we got a new dog the other dogs would always beat her up and i would literally make them cry and not just liked a short yelp they would make the sound for like a minute. i never felt guilty of doing it at the time but after weeks pass i think of how lonely it would be if the dogs died but then if they do one thing i dont like they would get beat. this doesn't mean i hate the dogs though, i still play with them and enjoy their company allot.
i also have some really messed up thoughts like necrophilia or beastiality and have many murderous thoughts from time to time (we live in the middle of nowhere and the only security other than a fence is our dogs and from time to time someone would stay here)

I'm not in a relationship and i feel like I'll never be able to get in one. i feel like I'm not a lovable person and anyone who I do care about doesn't even care about me. 
my dad died last year if that's helpful for anything?

She gave me a paper saying that I got prescribed for mental illness. The questions that I scored high on (that I remember) were too much sleep, thought of death, eating habits, and feeling down. Honestly, I thought this was a normal thing for people my age (20M). Never thought of it as a problem. However, now that I think about it, I've been like this since I was 13 but never took it seriously. There was a family feud that lasted until I was 19 but as usual, I thought it was normal.

40,"It’s 1:30 in the morning and I should be sleeping but I can’t stop thinking about something I heard a while ago.

A while back , I was on my period (I know, bit uncomfortable to talk about), and I was having a big time break down due to family issues, that were 100% a good reason to get upset. 

Then, my mom says something like 

“well,  are you on your period? “

I tell her yea. 

Then she says something like that’s why you are so upset! 

I was like wut, I’m having a break down and that’s wut you say. 

Although teenage hormones and other crap do make you feel sad or angry, doesn’t mean that it should be brushed off. 

You still are feeling the emotions, and it still hurts. It’s not my moms fault for blaming my period,  it’s what we are taught. 

It’s been ingrained in society that teens are angsty and their emotions aren’t really what they are feeling, it’s just a phase. When really, not feeling validated in our emotions makes it worse.

I’m not sure if this is all true or just a rant. I just wanted to say it somewhere.",16Jul2019,5
41,"Basically the title, but here is my story. 

People always say the younger generations have it hard, but I don't think people realise how hard we have it. But, hey, maybe we are all just soft on the inside and we truly are pansies. 

Anyways, I fall in line with Gen Z. In school, I always get good grades and make good ""friends"", but I feel lonely, empty almost. 

I live in a great household, have loving and caring family, but I just don't know what it is that affects me. Maybe it is all the pressure put on me to maintain my grades, maybe it's just that I feel panicky in a lot of situations. 

Some days, I go to bed with a smile on my face, but lately, those days are far and between. Now I usually go to bed with tears rolling down my face, wondering how I got into all these moods in the first place. 

Usually, my parents ask me how my day was, and I usually respond with ""I got through it and thats all that matters"" Which, in my eyes, is true because I sometimes wonder what would life be like for others if I was no longer there. Not suicide, but run away. I have contemplated it before and got up to pack my stuff, but something stopped me. I couldn't explain the feeling, it was if I was about to pass out from emotional stress. I was happy to go, sad to leave my family, mad at myself for thinking about it, which in turn, put me right back at square one. 

My Mom is saving up money so that I can be online schooled, which I am excited for, but I still feel empty. I enjoy soccer, watching anime, and traveling. When I am not playing soccer, which is rarely (2 days off per week), I binge watch anime. Maybe it is an unhealthy lifestyle since I rarely have time to relax, but what (if anything) should I do to change myself and my way of thinking. 

Usually I try to live life to the fullest, but I can't since I am rarely happy nowadays.",16Jul2019,1
42,"I really, really need to get this off my chest. Last August I took LSD. I had done it before over a dozen times and it was safe so I decided to take two tabs instead of one. Without going into too much detail, my friend was about to dial 911 when I finally became ""conscious"" again. I apprently blacked out for 5 hours after repeatedly falling down the stairs, hitting my head, and vomiting. He told me I looked like I was seizing/having a seizure, but I can't verify any of that.

In my thoughts, I convinced myself I was dead. It was terrifying. I admit I was completely stupid and ignorant then. A month before this, I smoked too much weed and genuinely believed my friend's house was on fire. I was pacing, bawling my eyes out, and hallucinated that I could feel my skin burning. After I became sober I was extremely jumpy and can't stand thoughts of fire or the sound of fire alarms. I admit that I used drugs in the past without much thought. I didn't think my mental illness could be this bad (Also - I don't use drugs at all anymore, I know I was completely stupid and abused these substances).

It's been almost a year since those events, and there is so much new wrong with me that I almost can't explain. For context, I've been suicidally depressed since I was 10, and have had both anxiety and dissociation problems since I was 8, both of which I sought therapy for. But this feels different.

I think about death and my ""bad trip"" every single day, especially at night. In the weeks and months immediately following I was genuinely convinced I was in purgatory/already dead. My panic attacks are much worse, and I didn't think my anxiety would ever be worse than my depression. I don't feel connected to reality or to people, and I make so many mistakes at work because of brain fog and invasive thoughts.

It seems really silly to write all of this out. It's also more severe than I can put into words. I know I need help. I'm on edge nearly all the time even a whole year later. Even storms send me into a panic. I think everything is going to kill me, and that the people around me aren't real or just some kind of projection. I don't know. I know what I did was stupid and I can't touch drugs ever again, they immediately send me into a panic. 

I know traditional ""bad trips"" make some people lose touch with reality temporarily. But the thing is, I've already been dealing with severe mental health issues even before that event. I just have this strong feeling that I've developed something or brought out some latent mental illness, and that bad trip was kind of the ""tipping point"". Mental helath problems run in the family as well, and I'm wondering if me approaching my early to mid-20's is also bringing out some mental illness I would have developed anyway.

If you took the time to read all of this, thank you. I know a lot of it sounds kind of silly to get worked up over, and I fully realize how dangerous the hallucinogens I used are. I just need someone to know what I'm going through.

In the process of getting a new therapist, didn't have any success with the last one, just couldn't trust them and get into anything past small talk.  Im in the middle of a move so it's difficult right now to get the process going, figure out what my parents plan will cover, etc And moving to a new city and having to find a new job is giving me a lot of stress.   

I've been struggling with depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts/attempts since early teens.   Self harm, paranoia, drug abuse and panic attacks came later.  Never been officially diagnosed with anything, every trip to the ER I just lied to the therapists because I was afraid of admitting something was wrong or having what I say be used against me.  More recently in the last two years I've been having a lot of mood swings.  It was great at first and I was very productive but it's turned pretty destructive in the last year.

I have no idea what's wrong with me, there's so many things that cause mood swings it's just overwhelming, I feel like I can relate to way too many symptoms in way too many disorders because im just so unstable my behavior is all over the place. 

 I don't wanna self diagnose because im not a doctor but I have no way to cope with how I feel, no idea whats wrong with me and zero support.  I have no idea how to deal with going from sad to happy so fast, or these angry episodes I keep having where I feel the need to smash everything.  It felt like before the swings were more over long periods of time but Its swinging in the span of hours now and it genuinely scares me.  

Usually I just get high to deal with my problems.  When I'm sober I fixate on things and play them over and over.  When Im high my memory is shit and I have the attention span of a fish.  I run between so many thoughts and ideas that it helps me calm down because im not just thinking about one thing or past traumas.  But money is tight right now and I really can't afford weed and I've been leaning back on selfharm against which is something I really don't want to do anymore.  i need some way to actually deal with these emotions instead of these temporary solutions that leave me feeling like shit a couple hours later.",16Jul2019,2
45,"Basically, everything in my life seems to be a shit show. I’ve been telling myself that things will get better for years now and they never seem to get there. Let me break this down:

-First and foremost, my mother is a relapsed alcoholic with mental issues of her own. She’s has been emotionally absent and kind of emotionally abusive for most of my life. She has basically stopped caring about anything except herself since my grandmother died back in December but the problems go back much further than that. I’m home for the summer for college and I have nowhere to go so I have to stay here and endure her bullshit.

-I can’t stand my job as it is very stressful and pays terribly low (pharmacy technician). I’m basically stuck in this job because throughout high school and some of college, I’ve had 11 jobs that I’ve left, some on bad terms. Also, I can work for the same company at a different location while I’m at school. So if I tried to find another job, I’d be jobless at school (work-studies at my school pay very little). I’m stuck here because I’ve created a situation where I’m dependant on this job even though it pays terrible and causes me an insane amount of stress, anxiety, and depression.

-I’m a musician and I’m going to school for music. I aspire to be a talented songwriter but I have hundreds of unfinished songs because I end up hating everything I write. It’s a problem because I want to be great at songwriting so bad but, I can’t even finish one song. I have very little confidence in myself as a musician.

-Lastly, after a few years of symptoms and doctor’s visits, I was finally diagnosed with IBS-D. I can’t travel very far without worrying about my stomach problems. I’m also terrified of performing because I had an incident where I left the stage to run to the bathroom once. So now it’s a constant struggle to perform, even though it’s something I love to do otherwise.

I’m sorry. I know this is very long but I have no other options for reaching out at this point. I see a therapist but I honestly don’t always feel like it works. Any help is greatly appreciated.",16Jul2019,1

47,"Hello. This is a first for me, so here it goes. 

I have always thought myself to be mentally healthy for the most part, but I have one flaw. I have really dark thoughts that I cannot get out of my head no matter what I do. I have bitten myself, chewed my fingers to bleed, and other things, yet these thoughts come back. It could be the thought of a family member dying in a very gruesome way with a detailed picture in my mind. Just recently something triggered this. A poor girl was killed, and the killer posted her death picture on Instagram. I saw this picture by accident, to spare all the graphic details, It was a very gruesome picture that involved a slashed neck. The second I saw that it felt as though a cloud went over my head and I saw my little brother and mother in replacement of her. It made me sick. This happens too much. Even at the movie theater, I saw Dark Phoenix. The first scene with the car crash, my mind replaced them with my family and me in the car, with a horrible thought of us getting into a fatal car crash. The first time I remember this really happening was after freshman year health class, where they showed us the video of the kids that were killed in car crashes. Seeing their bodies stiff and rigid, made me very depressed that day. Seeing the face they died with, thinking about what went through their heads. Anytime I see death, my mind replaces it and makes me suffer. I don't know what to do. I've always had an attitude that if I died, I would not have any regrets, as I try to live a life that will leave me with none. I have come to terms with my own death, but not with the death of others, or the ones close to me. The image of the girl that was killed today really set me off. Even now, that image will randomly pop into my mind and I can't get it to leave. I want to forget it, but I can't. I am losing to my own mind. I do not want these dark thoughts clouding my head, and have no mechanism to cope. I also have no one to talk to about these things. My friends would call me a pussy, and my parents would think i'm insane. I just wanted a place to vent this out, since this is one of the first times I have poured my thoughts and feelings out like this.",16Jul2019,1

I moved out and started dating someone else and i thought my ex was moving on aswell.
For the most part things were amicable between us. 

Last wednesday I went over to her place to feed the dogs we had together. We were talking and she got very upset and emotional and tried to have sex with me. I left and told her i thought it was best we didnt talk for a while because of my new relationship and emotions were high.

Tonight she texted me that she wanted to kill herself. Shes never said that before and because several of my sibblings have killed themselves it was always a very sensitive topic between us.

She had downed a whole bottle of whisky by herself, done about a gram of coke and was laying on the floor inconsolable.
I hid her xanex and all but one of her SSRIs. Spent about an hour trying to get her into bed.

Left for less than 5 minuites to go to the bathroom and get her some water. When i came back up stairs she was sitting on the floor cutting her leg with a box cutter. I took the box cutter and threatenes to call the police and have her comitted if she didnt get back to bed.

We fought for a while but she is so drunk she is just inconsolably spiraling. She eventually got back into bed and thank god the cuts on her legs werent that deep. 

I dont know what to do. She's sleeping now but im afraid she will wake up and do something impulsive. Im afraid to go home or go to sleep.

For example, I'm currently jealous of the stranger things cast, because they're all rich, young and they spend 100% of their time boysing out. They are everything I want to be. I know it sounds so stupid, but I just sit there and watch interviews with them and think of how successful they are and how much I have wasted my life. I know for a fact that in a week or two I will stop caring and move on entirely, but it will happen again in the future and i want it to end.

Generally the obsession is with some sort of celebrity or somebody who has had some form of influence in my life.

Was even bladee/yung lean for a bit lol drain gang

The overall point is, as stupid as it sounds, I just want to stop having random cycles of envy so strong that I sleep from 7am to 5 pm and stay up all night thinking about how shit I am and how much i wish i could be them.

I dont know if I have depression or not, I have asked before if we can go and see someone to figure out if I have issues or not but my parents have never taken me.

I also identify as a guy, and ever since we moved being called a girl or 'daughter' has really been hurting me emotionally, because where I used to live all my friends called me by my name, and not my birth name. It hurts, but I cant do anything about it without someone calling me a slur or telling me I'm faking it.

I got really emotional earlier
I felt like a bad person (Annoying, rude, pushy) while me and my friends were playing a game. So I left for a bit to calm down. While I was gone my friend was talking about it with the other person, they didnt say anything rude but it still hurt my feelings they talked about it behind my back in private messages (I was going through chatlogs to look for something, and they didnt know chatlogs picked up PMs. I feel awful about it still). Me and my friend talked about it, they've been with me longer then anyone else besides family, and we finished on a positive note with (hopefully) no hard feelings.

I feel very pressured that day. PLEASE KEEP ON Reading ... Few weeks passed, and my bestfriend comes back and he told me that he is going to continue studying without going with his father. Remember that I also choose to group with my bestfriend because he is our top student in our class? We counted on him to be responsible in case there is an important that need to do but he is also depressed, he lost motivation on studying because of his problem to his family. I decided to be a leader in our group and we submit everything on our clients need without our original leader's decision. But there is one more thing that happened, I also lost motivation to continue because of my bestfriends problem and also because I found out that my crush developed a feeling with my guy groupmate. It was my worst year so far, I dont know anymore what to do to fix myself, fuck my decision right? For being leaving my old group of classmate. I feel very pressured on anything. I developed different bad habits because of what I did, I've been porn addict to just forget about anything, its been my withdrawal. I know I fucked up everything and It feels like I dont care on anything anymore. I just want to end my life but I'm too coward to do it... Its very fucked up now.. What you gonna do on my situation?",16Jul2019,1

I really hope this is the appropriate subreddit for this, please feel free to delete if not. Also throwaway for obvious reasons. 

This will be kinda long, here’s some backstory. I am a 21 year old female who suffers from anxiety, depression and an eating disorder. 


Recently my psychologist has asked me to think back to when I was younger if there was any significant incidents. I was thinking about this and remembered this one girl from my childhood I’ll call her K.

I was about 10 and she was 12, we where in the same class and  had mutual friends at school and slowly became friends. K had a lot of issues, she had recently moved from overseas with her foster family to my area and started school. 

Hanging out with K became strange though, I must have blocked memories of this out but I can remember one day it was just her an I at my  house she kept on asking me “can we have sex?” And myself being a very naive 10 year old didn’t exactly know what sex was but new it was a bad word responded “no” 
 
She kept on asking and myself not knowing what that was gave in and said okay. Then she started touching my genitals and thrusting on my leg. I don’t remember  how I felt except I didn’t like it and wanted her to stop. 

There was also a few instances where she would stay over and asked if she could “touch me down there” and myself saying “no” and I would wake up in the night with her hands under my underwear on my genitals. 

I don’t remember much of her, I think I must have blocked it out but eventually we drifted apart. 

These memories of her pop into my mind really occasionally and I’m not sure how to address them, It’s been over 10 years since this occurred and I feel so embarrassed  thinking about it. 

For many years whenever this thought arose I pinned it down as her just being experimental kind of a “kids will be kids” situation. I didn’t know wether to classify it as molestation. Even now I’m not sure? 

Because I’m unsure about the serverity of this instance I feel like its not important enough to tell my psychologist, I feel as though it may not have been a big deal and they’ll think  I’m over reacting. I’ve never spoken about this before to anyone and I’m rather afraid. 

But thinking back on this event makes me feel anxious, Im just not sure wether this was molestation  or just a weird pre-pubescent thing? 

Sorry that was long. I would love some advice because I’m pretty  lost about all this. 

TLDR; as a child my friend touched my genitals and made me feel uncomfortable, I’m unsure wether this is molestation and am not sure wether to talk to my therapist about this.",16Jul2019,1

Sometimes while im asleep, I'll hear familiar voices (friends, family, etc) all calling out my name. ""Op ... Op op op op OP OP op"" Y'know and I find it really odd. The voices progressively get louder and louder. Usually they're nuetral, kinda calling to get my attention, other times they'll sound irritated, like I just did something stupid. (Kinda like how you'd call out someones name if they broke something that wasn't very important to you but like it was still your thing and its irritating that they broke it) Sometimes I wont even hear my name, they'll just be having there own conversation with eachother and it'll sound like im in a lunch room. Some voices tend to be easier to focus on and tell what they're talking about, its usually just random day to day talk. Talking about game, shows, etc. Always after a while the voices get loud enough to the point where I wake up feeling really confused and some memory of what happened. Totally forgot to mention that sometimes the voices are directional, sounds like its behind me, right in my ear, etc. Its really odd to me and I'd like to know if it means anything.

63,"My brother is 18 and just moved in with us. He's pushing really hard to get his 17 year old girlfriend (who will be 18 in 7 months) to move in with us to get out of an abusive situation.

But, I think she's lying to me about a lot of things. She says that her evil stepmother runs the hiring departments for a lot of fast food places, and she can't get a job in her town. She has a dark, twisted, tragic backstory for every single moment of her life, and vivid details about abuse, so I don't feel comfortable calling bullshit on things like when I was a toddler, we found out my mom was doing meth when she tried to bake me in the oven."" She has my brother wrapped around her finger, and when we made a rule saying that she could only stay over at the house for 24 hours, she appeared fine with it, but then made such a big stink about it over the phone that my brother said he would move back in with our own abusive parents if it meant he could see her every night. It's nuts, because she claims that both her father and mother lost custody, and she was never put in the system. If true, that's horrible, but I'm smelling bullshit. At one point she convinced my mother to ask me to be her guardian. What? No!

So, they talked us down to 3 nights in a row. But I'm not so cool with that, as that's 6 days a week.

But anyway, to my question, one of the worst things she told me is that a couple of years ago she was diagnosed bipolar at 15, and she was an alcoholic at 14, but that no one ever referred her to a pdoc or institution. Is that at all likely?

She also claims to have explosive anger, and she is so paranoid and refuses to take lyfts or ubers out of fear of the drivers. She has my mom and brother completely on her side. I don't even know i it's legal to share the information I have already, but I am utterly terrified of this chick.

65,"i’m so confused about my mental state and don’t know who to turn to. the other day, i had the worst suicidal thoughts i’ve ever experienced. suicidal ideation and passive thoughts have drifted around my head for probably two years, but this time something so small it shouldn’t have even mattered set me off and i spiraled. not like i had an outburst, but for the first time i put together a plan. i wrote the first few words of a note (didn’t get farther before berating myself for being dramatic), and tried to think of a good time to do it. for the next day i slept a lot, didn’t eat, and couldn’t stop replaying my plan in my head to calm myself down. 

the next day i woke up and was fine. how can that be possible? that’s not how depression works, there’s no switch, but somehow for me i can be perfectly alright and then a tiny, seemingly irrelevant event can make me turn to the thought of suicide. it’s like all the highs and lows are blown way out of proportion, but i’ve never reached out for help because the days where i’m ok convince me it’s not necessary. my thoughts don’t feel real anymore and i’m so unsure of everything. am i really suicidal, or are the lows just bad days? everyone has bad days, right? 

not a single person knows about this. i’m too scared to tell someone, i don’t want my parents to know, and so many people around me are struggling that it’s just too inconvenient to be sick right now. i feel like i still function despite being in a constant state of turmoil. if i was really struggling, wouldn’t people notice? wouldn’t i be debilitated? don’t know when it’s actually serious.",16Jul2019,3
66,"Long story short, I have lifelong mental illness and multiple complicated diagnoses and none of my previous attempts at therapy have worked. I live in a remote area with long wait lists and few therapists/psychologists that have the necessary training to deal with my kinds of issues, so I've turned to internet therapy but I feel like that's mostly aimed at people with ""minor"" problems - the sessions are only 30 min long and I always feel stressed about trying to explain all my problems in the allotted time even with 1 hour sessions. This time I'm debating sending the therapist a letter ahead of time detailing my issues, but I feel weird about doing that and like I'd have to write a book to even begin to cover what I feel a therapist should know before we start a treatment. 

It just feels like I'm too much trouble for one therapist - like I'd need a full team of shrinks working fulltime for there to be any chance of sorting all my issues out. I'm not expecting therapy to be a magic pill, I'm very prepared to do the hard work, but I need to feel like the therapist actually knows and understands me and my problems before we dive in and most shrinks just seem to want to fixate on one (to them) relatively easily solvable problem without even knowing the full picture. Is it crazy to want your therapist to actually know you and what you've been through before starting treatment?

It's something I've been trying to figure out myself. As far as I can tell, potential factors for me may be:

* not having a healthy family life. Never had a positive father figure, and from a young my family always tried to cover up my anxiety and other issues without getting me the support I possibly needed. In hindsight I think it's possible I might be undiagnosed autistic.
* turbulent home life, financial struggles growing up.

69,"hello, first I would like to describe my problem more thorough. (english is not my main language, but I will try my best regardless) 

&amp;#x200B;

Im 21 years old, about to start my major in material sciences in octobre, currently writing my bachelors thesis. 

In high school and university, I have been very succesful thus far (considering my grades), even though I never really tried nor cared. I would just spend about 8 hours a day playing LeagueOfLegends everyday, completely disregarding my university-stuff.

Even though my academical accomplishments as they are right now leave barely any room for improvement, and I also do very good in other parts of my life that I value (I am a very decent boxer e.g.), I feel like I barely accomplished anything in relation to what I am able to do. The few friends that remain to me always tell me that I am way to harsh on my self, but I can never take their words to heart because I dont feel like my standards are anywhere close to theirs. 

Everytime they tell me of their accomplishments, e.g. that they managed to go to the gym twice this week, I cannot help but belittle them in the back of my head. I am glad for them that they set goals for themselves, but I cannot relate to them. Most of my friends' goals, or almost everyones' goals really, seem so vain and irrelevant to me, even though I never call them out on it. 

&amp;#x200B;

As in regard to my parents, they never really seemed to care what I was doing, so I never really bothered to try and improve myself further. I always got shat on by them for bringing home Cs or Bs, even though my little brother barely struggles by by writing mostly Cs and Ds, and for him they always seem to throw a private party if he somehow manages to write a B. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I probably would manage to ace through my whole major if I wanted to, but when I know I am able to do something, the motivation just floats out of me, and sometimes I just wonder if i would REALLY be able to pull it off or if I am just overestimating myself severely. Apart from that, I do not really care if I manage to pull my mayor off with all aces, I dont have the impression that anyone cares really. As consequence, I dont feel like having the energy to pull it off. It also just seems like a very vain goal to me. If I think about it, almost anything seems completely vain and like a useless ""flex of muscles"" for me. I always feel ""dirty"" and like an utter showoff if I even try to seriously pursue a goal or target.

&amp;#x200B;

Its like I somewhat expect some godly entity to eventually lift me into a demigod status simply because I am under the impression that I would deserve just that. 

&amp;#x200B;

This ""state of being"", I might just call it like that, is ongoing for a few years now, and I am really starting to feel tired to the point of catching myself thinking ""If I'd get cancer now I dont think I would even mind"" or ""I might just throw away my life to save someone if the possibility arises, just so I can die off without any shame"", and I dont think that this is very healthy at all. 

I think what I really would like to happen is that I would be able to pursue any goal I like and completely use my whole potential on something without feeling like ""nah, its not worth it, your such a petty idiot to invest energy into it"", but I really do not know what I should try to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone of you ever felt somewhat similar and might be able to pass along some friendly advice or something?

I would really appreciate some help.

thanks for reading this by the way",16Jul2019,1

74,"I've found over the years that Facebook is toxic for me in more ways then one. At a time in my life I spent time in a mental ward due to psychosis.. I was there for about a month recovering and got to know a few of the other patients.. it turned out that everyone of the younger ones I got to know (aged between 17-25) all had spoke too freely on Facebook just as I did  before they were admitted. Now I find that interesting.. 

I understand every social media based app/site has freedom of speech but I think how Facebook differs is that almost anyone who is willing to use a smartphone has a Facebook account because everyone has one. And it is personal lives with personal photos with real names, and where they work and go to school. There is so much personal information everyone shares about them selves, what they did on the weekend.. selfies that people spend hours just to get the perfect one to show the Facebook world I'm awesome! 

Everyone feels the need to share how great and perfect their lives are. And everyone will add everyone because they don't want to upset a family member or a friend of a friend because they didn't accept their add. But then your stuck with them commenting on your shit.or generally knowing your shit so you get paranoid about what your like to share..

 I'd get so overwhelmed just seeing what these people's lives were like and beat myself up being frustrated that I didn't have the life that these people had, or wanted us to see. Seeing everyone's information really wore me out aswell, like it'd make me think too much about their lives and how much fun they looked like they were having and realising I'm a boring person. Or id see these stunning photos of girls I knew and would get angry at myself that I used to look good in my teens and early 20s and now I look like crap. Or the best one yet, seeing videos of what friends babies were doing and feel bad that my kids weren't quite developed as theirs that that age ( I know that sounds messed up but I couldn't help it).

 Then there's the times where you feel like you really want to vent and it starts a ball rolling because every one you knows seen it and you upset a bunch within minutes. My psychosis really started when I started ripping into all these people while on Facebook who i was friends with growing up about how much things pissed me off about them, people started cheering me on by saying good on you that needed to be said, everylne feels the same about these people. but then I couldn't stop. I felt so powerful that it got to a point where I was saying some really messed up shit that they all thought I was on the verge of hunting them down and killing them. 

I couldn't sleep for days or stop myself from constantly writting all this bullshit about religion and how I had power over tourists coming to bomb my home town. So yep got fairly messed up but what does my head in about the whole situation was it took authorities a week to have me sent to a ward, I abused people for this long before they did anything. I shouldve had my Facebook page shut down but it never happened.

 It's been about 8 years since this all went down, I lost every friend I had because of it. I don't blame Facebook for what I did but I'm angry at the freedom of speech it has, and i hate that everyone is so involved in everyone's lives. I know it's one of those things it is what you make it but for me I'm just too impulsive to find a medium with it. I can't help but look through profiles or pictures, I can't help but look at that profile of a friend I'm not friends with anymore only to upset myself that we aren't friends anymore..  the day I deleted Facebook was the day I felt I woke up from the matrix.

83,"Hi all - I'm studying User Experience Design - the design process for products and services and how people interact with them. For my current project, I'm exploring ways to expand access to mental health care and resources.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to learn more about the experiences people have when seeking mental health resources, treatment options, etc., and am conducting a brief survey to gather information. This survey will take 1-2 minutes and all information collected will remain confidential.

&amp;#x200B;

Mental health is a sensitive subject for some - these questions are very general and do not ask for specifics around mental health obstacles one may have encountered; and again, all information collected will remain confidential. 

&amp;#x200B;

All input and responses will be greatly appreciated. Feel free to share with others. Thank you!

Also now my mental health has been declining since my break up from my toxic relationship about a year ago and mom cancer has been spreading slowly to other parts of her body like now she has stomach cancer and liver cancer. Originally she had breast cancer so I’m total 3 cancers during 15 years since 2005 and ever since I always had mental issues. Now it’s not severe like it was before I was little I always had crises and severe mental breakdowns but now I’m more easy going have a job, help my mom out and take my meds responsibly with a nurse since in the past I used to quit cold turkey. I take 30mil of lexapro, 10 mil of abilify and 200 mil of atarax daily but seems like when I miss a dose I feel much better than when I’m taking the meds I feel normal for a few days but then the withdrawal takes place and it’s like hell. Now I’ve been getting eye twitching daily much more fruently and I’m worried it’s the meds. Am I taking too much lexapro or any other meds I take. What recommendation would u give me based on any one else’s experience with these meds. I’m not trying to get off meds becuz if I do I will decline even more with seeing my mom sick if I don’t take lexapro I will Have crying spells and begin to over think. I feel like the meds prevent me feeling any actuall feeling like a zombie. Also had 5 diff phychs change within the last 2 years. The first best doctor left which I miss him he was like a father to me. I need help on how to cope maybe one day without too much meds if possible with my situation.

If so, do you have any information as to whether or not the behavior was normal or should there be concern? A family member has suffered from depression for decades. They’ve always been on Paxil with Ativan to take as needed. I believe they take a shot of alcohol every evening to help sleep... I’m worried they may be taking more if they don’t get the effect they need, but don’t know for sure. I’m trying to get a grasp on the reality of the situation and am afraid if I call any type of hotline they will all tell me to get them help if I’m concerned, regardless of what’s going on. I guess I just need you guys to agree with me that behavior like that is not normal and give me some insight into how your own personal experiences have turned out.

For as long as i’ve known her my best friend has told me constantly that she’s depressed and all she thinks about constantly is how she wants to die and how she’s never happy and nothing makes her happy. Now call me an asshole or whatever for this next part but I can’t shake the feeling that she may be attention seeking. I’ve never suffered from mental illness so I don’t know what it feels like or what it makes you think or say, but from having dealt with other people who have mental conditions, none of them have ever said it as often or brought it up as often. I love her so much so i’m not trying to be mean or disrespectful when I say that its constant. She’s constantly bringing it up that nothing brings her joy and constantly saying she wants to die or kill herself. I don’t know if its as bad as she makes it out to be, can anyone tell me if some people with depression are okay with just parading around telling everyone about it or if she’s just attention seeking? 
Also. last thing, yesterday while walking back to her house she said something that suddenly made it feel real but i’m still not sure what to think. She told me i’ll have to accept that she won’t be around for long and may be gone ‘soon’, and that its best for me to just come to terms with it instead of pretending its not gonna happen.

Every hour or so I change my mind. Sometimes I love to play the piano, Sometimes I decide I wanna sing, and sometimes I just decide I'm gonna play video games for a living. I don't even know what I like. All I know about me is that something is wrong. is that something is required to change. but I just don't know how. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression 4 years ago. But I don't think that's it. I feel there's more to it. All my world is black and white. I either love everyone and wanna accomplish everything or hate everyone and want to sleep all day. 

I tell my girlfriend I love her, but then I don't know why. I don't know why we're together now, but in half an hour I'm gonna go back to thinking she's the best thing I ever had. that's what it's been like in my past relationship too. I go each day tens different times through these changes. either I want her, I need her, I want a future with her, I love her so much, either that, or a state of, I don't need you. you can go away. I only need myself. I will find someone better and I will be happy. But you make me happy. No you don't. what does make me happy? I don't know anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m a student researcher in the Department of Communication at Emporia State University. My faculty advisor, Dr. Michael Dennis, and I are conducting a study that will feature analysis of posts within the r/mentalhealth subreddit. Our plan is to collect all posts published between January 1, 2019 and June 15, 2019 that contain contributors' narratives about their experiences with mental health circumstances or concerns, and any subsequent comment threads.

These posts and threads will be copied and pasted into a Microsoft Word document database master file. They will be collected and recorded verbatim except for that user ids and any other naming or identifying practices will be omitted. Therefore, both privacy and confidentiality will be entirely preserved. We will not contact contributors or contribute our own posts to the subreddit. 

The data in the Word document database will be subjected to thematic analysis to locate instances of constructs that pertain to Health Communication literatures such as disclosure, appraisal, and coping mechanisms. Our hopes are to publish our findings in a peer-reviewed journal, to advance relevant scholarship, and to produce insights that may inform efforts to enhance the help seeking and support of those faced with mental health concerns and issues. 

Our protocol was approved (Expedited, Protocol ID Number 19116) by the Emporia State University Institutional Review Board for Treatment of Human Participants on June 24, 2019.

Neither researcher has any conflicts of interest to report. The study is funded by a Summer 2019 grant from the ESU Summer Undergraduate Research Program (ESURP).

*Please contact us at any of the addresses below if you wish to opt out and to have posts you have contributed removed from our database.* We will also be happy to report our results to you, as requested.

Meanwhile, I'm dying inside and the amount of energy it's taking me to keep up my act is becoming more of an issue.  I can't open up to my family because they have their own issues to deal with I have to be strong for them.  But I feel more and more like I'm drowning and I'm grasping for straws.  Counseling &amp; therapy are pretty much out of the question bc of the cost and my finances are part of the reason I'm having issues to begin with.

For a few years I have been questioning whether I should go see on because occasionally (sometimes one or twice a month) I'll have serious mental breakdowns (includes sobbing and headaches). It's usually very sudden and I always end up hiding myself in my room or bathroom. Afterwards, I always feel very empty as  if I'm void of all emotions. Also, I tend to have big mood swings. Sometimes, I'm be super happy and excited. Other times, I feel super down and all I want to do is stay alone in my room.

Recently, I've been super irritable and I've broken down at least 3 times these last few weeks. Though, I think it's because I'm spending 2 months away from home in a different country with a whole new routine or I'm finally exploding/imploding. 

I usually dont like show my emotions or asking people for help, but right now I feel like there's nothing I can do. I haven't told anyone about how  I feel because I dont want anyone to worry and plus I heard it costs alot of money to see mental health professionals. 
Though, I did cry while calling my parents today and they said it's normal. What they dont know is how often it happens at home.

That mental health professionals only send me to the bad wards. Which is kind of true,they always said beds were full etc. It makes me feel manipulative. N stupid too. I feel like I wanna walk away from the mh system yet I need meds to sedate me. Cause her comments are so biting that I might start cutting again. Yet I've been hurt physically n emotionally by some ppl with bpd. I feel like my whole brain is splitting into two. She says I shouldn't take my full dose cause it makes me fat. I'm doing intermittent fasting,told her not to police my actions.

She's been giving me shit saying I changed for the worse,saying I look crazier without acknowledging her role in it. 
Maybe my future employers connected the dots and kind of figured who I am. That's why I'm jobless. But at this stage, I don't think I will ever be stable enough.

It also explains why I get shunned so often by people in my age group.

I really , REALLY don't want to accept it as fact. But unfortunately, I do. Because I truly believe it to my core.

I search on the web and find, 10,000 things I never knew: different specialities, different types of therapy, the diff between a therapist and a psychologist etc etc etc....

If your willing please just tell me about how you found a therapist, what was the office like? What kind of furniture did they have? Did it smell like a doctors office? How do you meet a therapist in the appointment? Is there smalltalk? What kind of questions does a therapist ask the first time you go?  What kind of forms do you have to fill out? Was it awkward? How long did it take before you stopped sugar coating how you talked about your reality? What kind of things do therapists ask you to do as homework? What surprised you the most about meeting with a therapist? What preconceived notions did you have about therapy before you went? Did that change?  Anything else you want to throw in is welcome.

114,"Fair warning, this is very long, and something I need to get out. I have nowhere else to turn, so please, bear with me. 

Sunday I had a full blown panic attack in the middle of the grocery store, probably the worst I've ever had. My husband sent me to the car, finished checking out, and took me home. He seemed supportive. Unfortunately, I did something (I have no idea what exactly set him off) and he suddenly decided that he's ""had enough"" of my behavior, which I he knows I cannot control in any way. He  began screaming at me when I started crying, he continuing screaming  ""shut up, just shut the f*** up"" which sent me straight over the edge and I was bawling hysterically. At this point, he left. He left me there, in that state, all alone. This is not normal behavior for him, which made it all the more shocking, and all the more scared because I had no lifeline. 

I am bipolar. I was already in a very, very bad place. I had pill bottles in front of me, looking up how many I would need to make sure I died and didn't just make myself a vegetable. On one site there was a number to call, and I decided to try to talk to someone. I have never reached out like that before. The man on the line was kind; he helped me get under control; he helped me see how much pain I would cause everyone in my life even though all I could think about was ending my own.  Eventually, I put the pills away. 

My husband came home a few hours later and apologized. It was very perfunctory, and did not sound genuine in any way. Again, this was very unlike him, and I was still in shock that this person who was being so cold was the same man who has supported me all the way  Later that evening, I asked him what happened to make him suddenly and completely go off the deep end. He proceeded to tell me that my behavior has been out of control for the past few months and everyone can see it but me. I wanted to ask why he let it go on so long without saying anything, but I was afraid to start an argument. Then he told me how angry he is that I hadn't done enough to find a new doctor (mine retired in December). This isn't  true; our insurance doesn't cover many doctors and finding one who's actually accepting new patients is very difficult. It is also very overwhelming to keep trying and being shot down. I finally found someone, and made an appointment 2 months ago. I'm going to my first appointment tomorrow. 

 Clearly, my meds aren't working. Therapy isn't working. I'm apparently completely out of control, and I don't even realize my behavior isn't normal. Something's got to give. 

When I go to this doctor, if I am completely honest about my extreme manic behavior mixed with severe lows, the panic attacks that are taking over my life, and the fact that I can't take it anymore to the point that suicidal ideation has become an everyday occurrence, I'm afraid she will want me to go inpatient. This scares me more than anything because I have not heard any positive experiences from people who have been. I'm afraid it will be a nightmare and not do anything to actually help me. Does anyone have any advice at all? 

TL;DR: I'm out of control, I need more help than I am getting right now, and I'm afraid my new psychiatrist will want me to go inpatient. I'm scared, and I really need advice.",16Jul2019,3

\*Sigh\* here we go again. Well actually not again in the “technical sense” as this is my first blog post for this section but you will eventually get the point. So this is the other section in the blog and is about my opinion (sometimes incorrect) on this flaming, burning, and dying planet that we inhibit. In contrast to the other parts this will be spontaneous and inconsistent, but deal with it, getting pissed off at the world has no schedule. All in all, this will be fun and hopefully you enjoy it a wee bit.

Also for those of you who want to read up on my story check the other link in bio!

So what is this half black all bad individual talking about saying “here we go again,”? I’m talking about the god damn white supremacist, Imperial Wizard, orange looking man that you have leading your regressing country. Before I begin, y’all have to wake up and break the system and stop letting these white people in power disrespect your own, all the while marginalizing us and minimizing our actions. Has it not become abundantly clear that they are scared of our opinion, they don’t want the people to thrive! Don’t be passive to hate and don’t teach or spread hate, take care of your neighbour (no matter what colour), and don’t let the scared be bullies.

Well then that is enough of that rant. The topic for todays opinion is about whether or not Trumps tweets were racist or not. To be brutally honest I do not even believe that I have to state that as a question, because **NO DUH THEY WERE RACIST.** However in todays political sphere it is okay to tell a Person of Colour to “go back to where they came from and fix their government.” UHM, he just told four women of colour to go back to where they came from… 

**How is that not racist?** 

The truth of the matter is that this has become a new norm for the American Government, and it is very sad and upsetting to watch. It is 2019 we should be growing, and nurturing each other not be segregated and filled with hate. We have our Police Officers, the ones who are suppose to protect us, shooting our children in the streets, we are dealt injustice after injustice and the list is far longer than this. But what I really want to say is that we know their president is a racist in the White House however his actions on Monday illustrated an image that should petrify us all. Trump can do whatever he wants and the government will allow him to do it. Chaos hasn’t begun you are already extremely far into that road.

To the people who have stood up for your powerful ladies I praise you, and we need more of you. The women were correct in their statements, he is a racist, and they do not have to apologize to him. To you ladies I applaud you and keep doing your thing, eventually/hopefully America will wake up, and there will be more voices to support you and make ourselves heard.

Remember; he is causing this media uproar because he is attempting to distract you from a bigger picture or something critical that is happening. What could that be….?

116,"Hi, I’m a 15 year old girl. Recently I have experienced hallucinations and delusional behaviour/false beliefs.

Is there any way I can get rid of this without any form of medication? I am seeing a Psychologist but I’m unsure if they will be able to help me.

117,"My first ever reddit post as far as i remember. Non Eng  middle age SOB sorry. This would be a very very long story, so this only the current situation from my POV: I am chatting with a FB stalker lady madly in love with me from another continent on a daily exact routine schedule, writing her messages pretending i am a mr Spock character, deliever her logic and facts i google from the internet and translate to her language as we go. All the things she are interested in. It is a copy and paste nightmare. I do this every day so she is happy and to help her endure her boring shop job, daily life struggles in a poor country, and when she have these fantasies about me, she is nice to everyone in her family and at her work. I stopped 1 week once, All hell broke loose all over the place. At her work, everyone was useless and hostile to her in her mind. This are influencing the life of others too (Damn butterfly effect) If i don't keep doing it. I am soon afraid the whole god damn contry would collapse without me. I also do the same with an ex girlfriend from Thailand. At least she understand some english and the concept of friendship, no translation and extras are needed. But of course everything about the concept of helping friends she knows too. It is amazing how many times a buffalo can get sick. Jesus C, i really need help. I'm not sure what is wrong with me, but i suspect a manic depressive dissorder sure don't help things. It's like i wake up in situations like this. It's a hell of a ride. I really wish all this were not true, Any thoughts would be highly appreciated. Please don't say stop, if it was that easy i would seriously not use 60 min to write this nonsens, i would use that time for all the translation work qued up awaiting me. hola amigos.",16Jul2019,0

119,"For the past few years I had a lot of issues with depression and social anxiety. It really made my life a lot worse and at the beginning of the last year I was starting to have suicidal toghts. The main thing that kept me from doing it was my family and that I was never truly alone. I had amazing friends, a therapist and parents to turn to when things got bad and I am forever grateful for that.

The thing is I am at an age where travelling with my parents is not the greatest thing imaginable anymore and when my best friend asked me to go on vacation with her I immediately said yes. Originally we planned our trip so that it took place at the exact time as my family vacation. I never wanted to be alone, just in case.

The big problem came up when my dad didn't get the vacation days he wanted so my parents moved their vacation forward for two weeks. That made me panic because I was not able to reach them 90% of the trip. They will be off the grid for the most part and turn their phones of to really ""get away from life and work"". 

I knew of this change of plans two months before the actual vacation happend and I spent these two months panicking and being a mess in general. I was practically unable to do everyday things because of it.

Six days ago my family left for their vacation.

For me this time went so much better then expected. I woke up at 9 ever day (normal for me is 12/13 o'clock), I shower every day and today I cleaned up my room and the kitchen. I could not get myself to do that for months and I feel so motivated right now. I even planned to go out with friends on my own, the first time in our friendship that I initiated a meet up.

This gives me so much hope and confidence for my future. Maybe I can go to University in my dream country after all, maybe I will even travel the year after school. Being forced in to a situation that was one of my worst fears before made me realise that I'm maybe not so weak after all.

Right now I honestly believe my life could turn out good. There is still a lot going on and I still have a ton of issues but if I can change one thing I can change almost everything. I really hope this feeling will last a long time, it's great!",16Jul2019,1
120,"I’m a 23-year-old woman in an ostensibly great period of her life.
I got into the top program in my industry, I have great friends and family, and I’m always told that I’m a beautiful girl.
Everything is awesome. The world is my oyster! Just one small problem: My anxiety is fucking horrible right now.

I am constantly speaking negatively about myself, it’s like a compulsion. I’m TOLD that I’m pretty but I don’t feel like it anymore. For some reason I’m like hyper-aware of all my imperfections. And they’re real, it’s not like I’m size 4 IG baddie with flawless skin.
I also keep feeling like I didn’t DESERVE to get into my program even though they scored our tests numerically and told our class that we scored the highest AND actually know what I’m doing on most days because I had experience doing that kind of work so much of it came reflexively. Thing is, the rest of my class came from Ivy Leagues while I dropped out of a state school because my family couldn’t afford it. So while it looks like I earned my way here, it feels like I’m playing a role that can be exposed any minute. I feel like the Talented Mr Ripley!

Like, I’ll literally think the phrases “I am beautiful and I’m deserving of love” and “I worked my way here and deserve to be here as much as anybody else” but they won’t feel like the truth. I haven’t felt this vulnerable since high school.

Much of this must have to do with being in a drastically new environment and entering a new stage in my life. Like, I’m about ready for a relationship and know that from here on I’ll be dating seriously so it actually kinda matters now, and I’ve never felt that way before. I’ve also never been in such a competitive space before, where EVERYBODY is whip-smart and capable and expected highly of, so I overthink and obsess over my assignments and end up making small mistakes because I’m not taking my time and trusting myself.

I really want to like and trust myself again. How can I change my internal monologue.",16Jul2019,1
121,"I always do things for other people. I wash the dishes and clean my room to please my mother. I only do fun things when I do them with someone else (I want to go hiking by myself, but knowing myself there is a VERY low probability of that ever happening). I don't have friends to do things with, so yea, not a lot's going on in my life.

Now, I'm 21 and I realised a few weeks ago how incapable I am of taking care of myself. Health and personal hygiene is important to me, but I was home alone for about 1.5 weeks and ... I starved (I love food). I didn't wash my clothes (and I don't have a lot of clothes ... oops). I didn't do the dishes. My room was a mess.

I don't want to be so lazy. But it's like ... I WANT to do these things, but I can't. If I don't do them for someone else, it feels like I physically can't do them. I love cleanliness, I feel bad when it's not clean but I also easily ""forget"" that it's messy - because I ""can't see it"" after a while.

I am so ashamed that I'm unable to take care of myself properly. I need people to tell me what to do (I've tried to make lists and schedules to hold myself accountable but it never works).

What should I do? I've tried to grow up but it's impossible. What's wrong with me?",16Jul2019,1
122,"I don't really know how to word this, my English isn't that good. 
So lately I've had something that I could only describe as a panic attacks, but in my head I stay calm and think rationally while my body goes into full shutdown. Like if you were stuck in your own body and all is that's going through your head head is; ""why am I crying. There's literally nothing wrong, so why am I in hysterics. This makes no sense."" only this can get worse when I get frustrated with it and now I'm having a panic attack about having a panic attack.
I can usually kinda see why it happened, but wouldn't having an attack require me to actually think something is wrong?
A simular thing also happens when I get really upset about something small like being rejected into a group for a project . I'm ''like okay, not then'' but the waterworks still go on even if I don't actually care. And boom now I'm starting to feel anxious about the pointles crying and in a few minutes I'm having an attack about what I think is nothing.
So is it common to have stuff like anxiety and be completely aware of it but not really be able to do anything about it except hope it would get over soon?",16Jul2019,1
123,"Hey guys!
So my ex-partner suffers from severe anxiety and stress, and a bit of depression. We broke up 3 months ago due to this and throughout those 3 months it's been a rollercoaster of emotions, especially for him. We still care for each other and I still love him, and id like to know ways in which I can approach him and help him through this. He keeps going back and forth between wanting to be with me but then when he gets close he pulls away and remembers all the negative thoughts that make it impossible for him to see himself being in a relationship. Any tips please????",16Jul2019,1

127,"I’m not sure if this is a win or a loss, but I’ve had a very tumultuous time these last couple years and finally admitted I had a problem and needed help. I’ve thought about seeking counselling on and off for the last 12 months, and today I finally made it to the mental health counselling in my city.

I parked, got out of my vehicle, walked to the doors, past the doors, back to my car, and started crying and pretty much lost it.

128,"I don’t even know what to write. I’m hyperventilating and holding back tears right now as I’m on the train riding back to my apartment. 

Losing my job I can handle. Losing opportunities and love I can handle. I can even make new friends but this is a gut punch. I don’t even know how to feel. I am fucking numb and I have a brutal headache. 

By all accounts, I have made quite a lot of mistakes in my life. I have tried, I have tried harder but I know for sure no amount of trying will help my situation because I simply need help. 

My friends think I’m a user who goes AWOL and doesn’t return phone calls. My colleagues think I’m an arrogant prick who keeps to himself and he thinks I know too much. My own mother just told me I’m an ingrate and she wants nothing to do with me. 

I desperately need help! The last friend I told about my trauma and what’s going on in my head cut me off days later. My family will not acknowledge what I have told them because it’s just unacceptable. 

This isn’t my family’s fault. This isn’t my friend’s fault. I simply need help! I haven’t worked in a year and I’m close to being homeless. My career is in shambles and everything is not working no matter how hard I try.",16Jul2019,5

I’ve dealt with this along side anxiety and depression (diagnosed about a year ago) for what feels like forever. It’s taken me to a place where I’m afraid to love myself, because, I’m afraid what I begin to love won’t even truly be me. I just can’t stand this feeling.
