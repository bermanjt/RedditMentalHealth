0,"I have a bad track record with therapists.  I have seen like 28 in 18 years.  The most was about 30 to 40 sessions with one but that ended like 6 years ago.  This year I have completed a 10 session stint with one therapist and about a 10 session stint with another.   The first therapist changed jobs, so that wasn't my fault.  The second one -- I got sick of.  We were supposed to do DBT therapy but I wasted so much time in the sessions that we did little DBT, so I put that relationship on pause now.

I was thinking about Better Help the online, text, video counseling service or their competitor (can't think of the name).  I remember starting the process with them before but it seemed like they were set up for very simplistic conditions.  I have more severe diagnoses and have also been having a lot of obsessive psychotic thoughts lately.   I can't stop thinking about Prophet Muhammad, Pope Francis, and my enemies.   I have never opened up to a real life therapist about these obsessions.  I think I may be more willing to with an online therapist.      Has anyone with a complex condition tried Better Help or a service like it.

Thanks for your feedback.",13Dec2019,1

I started seeing things in my head, I see myself hurting others in inhumane ways, It's like I'm not alone in my head, there's someone else with me who is trying to corrupt me, he screams all day and all night, my ears are ringing and they wont stop, what is going on?

2,"I (Irish, 23) have been dating the most amazing woman (Brazilian, 24) since July. I love her, more than I've ever loved another person. I knew I loved her on our first date. She's been suffering a lot with mental illness and home sickness. In the past few weeks, she's had a harder than usual time and broke up with me two weeks ago because of her mental illness. I myself have been having my own issues stemming from past trauma (I was raped by a woman at 19 and afterwards had a 3 year long abusive relationship, I have not been able to have sex since that event at 19 and that played into the abusive relationship as my ex was very mentally abusive over it). She is the first woman I have ever felt completely comfortable with and willing to have sex with. She text me earlier to let me know she's almost certain about going home so I rang her and we talked and I told her how I feel about her. We were both crying by the time the call ended. She is the first person I want a future with, I'd propose to her only I'm still studying and would like to have a job before marriage. I don't know what to do, I can't make her stay because that would be selfish but I don't know how to go on if she'll be on the other side of the world",13Dec2019,1

Now I'm thinking I've only had three years practical experience in the field and I'm unqualified to teach anyone and if I got fired I won't be able to secure another job because I don't have enough experience.

6,"I don't even know what to write, but I'm just sad. There's no reason for the sadness - it simply is always there with me. It perches on the front of my brain and limps my entire body and self. I have straight As, it's freshman year of high school, I have a friend group, yet nothing seems meaningful anymore. And I don't fucking know why. 

This has happened before, and I got on antidepressants last year. I went through almost 6 months of treatment for my eating disorder and I gained weight and I ate and I didn't cry and everything was fine. So, now everything should be going better. Everything should be smooth and all my illnesses should drift further away.

I can't tell anyone. Last year, when I did, the worst year of my life came out of it. It was chaotic, tearful, and just a mess. So now, I can't give my parents any reason for more concern, worry, or disappointment - that would break me.

7,"So, here's a bit of a vent to get an emotional boulder off my chest...  
I'm a student. I have 180 hours of school missed since August. That is a lot. This month I haven't been able to go to school at all, I just feel too much like a failure to even get up and try anymore. 

I'm pretty sure this month was made extremely hard, because at the end of last month my usual psychologist had to go on a prolonged sick leave, so I don't know if I'll ever have an appointment with her again. She was the first mental health professional i really ''connected with''. 

I don't know what to do. I'm going to keep having absences from school to eternity. I'm interested in the field, I really am, but I just can't do regular 6-8 hour days of school 5 days out of the week. It's impossible. I don't understand how anyone does it. I've been this way for years, I don't even know what doing that feels like.

I think I'm doomed to fail.  


I guess I should seek sick leave but it's so hard to contact someone now that I don't have my psychologist, plus I'll just keep being a failure after it ends anyway. I don't know what to do.",13Dec2019,1

10,"So since my first post was at midnight and didn’t get anything, I’m going to repost this one more time. 

Help for my mom, everything is going to blow up this weekend

So I’ll try an summarize as best as possible. My family has been involved in a church for over 10 years, which I consider a cult and left several years ago, but they have been heavily involved. 

Now I believe my mom has been a broken person for a long time. She was depressed (taking medication for this) when we were kids but after we joined the church, she claims God healed her of her depression. She has now swore off all medicine for mental health, because the church tells you all the time that God can solve all your problems. 

Honestly I don’t think she ever got over her depression, and throughout the years has used this extremely judge mental religion to spiral more out of control. She has good days and every once in a while has a total freak out after someone pushes her buttons too much usually my sister but sometimes she does it to herself. 

Well my sister got engaged to someone part of their church group but out of the country, and my mom did not take all this well. Honestly I think he’s a nice guy. But my mom is convinced over this year that God has shown her he is an evil malicious person and confronted him over it  saying the meanest things. Things you can’t just brush off. Things that most might consider unforgivable. This was a few weeks ago. She also has delusions about how the fiancé is going to steal our identities (fiancé and sister are moving to his country and need lots of info for sponsorship for my sister). 

My mom shows no remorse and even though I tell her she is wrong she still believes she is right. She refuses to see any mental health professional or even her pastor because “they all think I’m crazy”. And she refuses to go on any medication. She even thinks everything is still alright  and that she’s going to the wedding. 

Until the wedding next year my sister lives with my parents and my mom has kept up being horrible. My dad, sister, pastor, and doctor all agree there needs to be an intervention. They decided to tell my mom on Saturday (just my sister) that she is not invited to the wedding and won’t be apart of their lives unless she seeks help and changes. 

Thing is when my mom melts down it is really bad. She cries and locks herself in her room and prays in tongues, then gets angry, rinse and repeat. I’ve mediated a lot of fights between my parents with her in this state and it is very difficult to get her to see reason and I always fear for her physical safety, like I’m afraid she might commit suicide. I have always been afraid of this.  When she was depressed when I was little apparently she was going to commit suicide by taking all her pills but there were none in the bottle. Additionally and recently after the whole thing a few weeks ago, after a long trip I asked if she had gotten home safely, and she replied yes, she didn’t see any deer even though she wanted to run them off the road. 

I actually took off all next week to stay with my parents for Christmas since I work all Christmas week, so I will be there to try and calm her all week, but this breaking point for someone I’ve always known is so fragile has been a fear of mine forever. Everything is literally going to change and I’m not a health care professional or even someone that follows their crazy religion. 

These last couple of weeks I’ve gently tried to get her to see how wrong she is, how she’s ruining her relationship with my sister and fiancé for ever, and how she needs help. Lately she has said “there’s a 50% chance I’m right and a 50% chance I’m wrong and being deceived (by the devil), I’ll find out at the wedding” but she doesn’t know she’s not invited to the wedding. She thinks everything is fine. It’s not fine. 

This whole thing has my dad so stressed he had to go to the doctor for some medication. 

When everything blows up on Saturday evening I’ll try my best to calm her. I’m probably the person she trusts the most but after she finds out I knew all this well in advance I don’t know anymore. I am planning on removing anything from her room she could use to harm herself beforehand, because I’m just so afraid of that happening. 

I need help, I don’t know how to get through this. Obviously I want her to see a professional but she’s so convinced she only needs God. I don’t think her completely abandoning her religion is a good idea either because it’s literally the fire and brimstone kind and she has built her entire “saved” life on it. It is literally built on fear. 

Also I should add she retired herself two years ago and has been staying home by herself working on her prayer life. That’s her “job”. I think this had a negative impact on everything as well. 

TLDR; mom was horrible to sister and her fiancé, isn’t invited to the wedding, has mental illness and religious problems, and everything will blow up on Saturday.",13Dec2019,1
11,"Hey, looking for some thoughts about something that is a little confusing. 
I've only self harmed 3 times this year (last one was 3 days ago). My
Psychiatrists still insists i see him 1x a month (for the past 6 months I've tried to extend the time to two months for more ). I kinda understand, but you'd think it would be okay for me to have an appointment in 2 months. I have a therapist, and my medication hasn't changed in over a year. I can count the amount of self harm Ive done this year on one hand. Apparently, my history of self harm makes me ""high-risk"" because self harm is inherently high risk. I don't quite understand.

20,"So I have always been underweight up until now. This is because last year people kept calling me anorexic (I wasn’t I just have a high metabolism) so I overate almost everyday until I gained weight. It wasn’t even healthy food either, it was junk food. Now I highly regret it bc after summer was apparently when I gained the weight bc I gained a few pounds, and have a lot of stomach fat. IM not fat I’m actually kinda skinny but I have stomach fat. And idk but I break down almost every night now because of it, because I can’t wear crop tops or leggings without looking pregnant and even if I don’t eat all day, morning skinny isn’t even anything. I’ve tried working out and eating healthy and it didn’t do anything and idk what else to do besides not eat, but if I do that then my metabolism will slow down and then when I do eat I will gain more weight so idk what to do.

Also I hate everything about myself I can’t even really describe it. I’m too flat, I’m too fat, my thighs are too thick, my face is a weird shape because my side profile looks like 🌛. My hair is too thin, and my waist isn’t tiny. But I can only focus on certain aspects of my body when I look in the mirror, not my whole self. I don’t even know what I look like. It’s like my brain can’t process what I look like so I just see a bunch of features but I can’t put them together to make a face.

And I can’t stop eating. I think Overeating  all the time ruined my ability to decipher when I’m hungry and when I’m not so I eat all the time, and when I stop I just accidentally eat again without even thinking about it. 

Is this normal??? Someone tell me. I mean I’m a teen so it’s probably just hormones or something right lolol.",13Dec2019,1
21,"Hi all!

I have been struggling to balance my life for years. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 20. 9 years later I still struggle to get my life in order. 

I have a psychiatrist who I've been seeing since April this year. She gave me all the assessments and decided to treat me for bipolar disorder. I've been on lamictal  and it does not appear to be very successful lately, even after tapering up. 

A few weeks ago I checked my health insurance website to check my eligibility for a procedure. I found that she had diagnosed me with ADHD during our initial visits. 

Before I became aware of this diagnosis, I told her I was having focusing problems. She kind of got defensive and said its not ADHD, but that my moods are up and down. 

Last visit I told her I had been taking phentermine (prescribed to me of course for weight loss purposes last summer) to concentrate better and complete basic tasks without distraction. I am not using it to cram and study. I just wanted to be capable of functioning normally. 

Anyway, she wants me to get additional testing done.

 Why would she submit this diagnosis to my insurance it she has not treated me for it?",13Dec2019,1
22,"Hi there, I've never used Reddit before but I honestly just need some insight on how to help out a friend. I'll be calling my friend 'Fred' here. I've known Fred since high school but ever since going off to college, they've started going back and forth with excessive mood swings ranging from depressive episodes to fits of anger. They're a DM in a DND group I'm apart of (Discord) and they've started to lash out at myself and the other players and then insinuate that we did it ourselves and they continuously want us to get mad at them for an excuse to be mad at themselves.

They've said some things that do concern me (centered around how they hate us on and off, want to legitimately fight us, why they're not a regular person, how ""they can't explain the negative feelings they can only let them out"", etc). Our DND group is currently doing the best we can (we've been helping for about a year and a half now) but it's gotten to the point where it's getting hard on our ends as well because Fred doesn't follow through with our advice (therapy, different medication, meditation, going out more, and other things) and it's become a not so healthy cycle in my opinion. I was hoping maybe someone could give some insight that we maybe haven't thought of yet.

I'll be adding anything else that comes to mind to this post when I can think about it more clearly (recovering from a concussion but I really wanted to make this post either way before I forgot about it).

I was the primary witness in a car on bike crash where the biker died on scene, a friend was hit and killed in a hit and run, a friend's father was murdered by someone he didn't know, and yesterday I found out that a guy I was close with at home died in a car crash. All of these people are so young. I have had a lot of trouble grieving each of them and each death hits me in a different way.

I've always had issues with anxiety as well. I started therapy when I was 11 because I wouldn't sleep because of my fear of someone coming into the house at night. As I got older I started having panic attacks because I thought I was dying from cancer or a heart attack or whatever it was. This all started to go away in my late teens but I think all of these deaths are triggering it again.

I feel that me dying young is inevitable, and that all of my friends and family are going to die in car crashes. It's different than it was before, I don't stay up all night every night and I can go about my day, but it's always in the back of my mind. Every small pain I feel seems like cancer, every creak in my apartment is someone breaking in to kill me. I don't get into cars when someone else is driving because I feel like we will crash.

My family is not super emotionally intelligent and to be honest this isn't something I want to share with my friends. Is there anything I can do in the meantime?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a performer. I love performing. It's my passion. Acting, Band, Dancing, etc. I do it all

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, about six months ago, during a choir performance a girl fainted. This would trigger something in my head that would change my performing habits. A performance after, I thought in my head about the time that girl fainted, and instantly I was hit with a dizzy like feeling. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why, but six months later, and I still have this dizzy feeling. It doesn't just occur on stage, but sometimes when I'm just standing and thoughts just enter my head.

37,"I grew up in a household controlled by an abusive father, who also happened to be very wealthy.

I have no self esteem and no confidence in myself... plus top that off with 26 years of shitty conditioning set by my parents, siblings, school and work. I got diagnosed with ADHD as a kid and also dyslexia. Which basically set my family’s mind set and also my schools mind set that I won’t succeed or do much in life. And it’s burnt in my brain so much that I’m dumb and stupid that I don’t have a place in this world. I’m my moms least favourite child because she never calls me and when I call her she’s always busy, while she calls my siblings every day. She helped all of them get jobs at her company except me because I’m an embarrassment to her.

I ended up getting a post secondary diploma in the future but I couldn’t find a job in that field which was 6 years ago.... so I just worked minimum wage jobs... fast forward to today and we’ll I quit my job because they were treating me badly (I fainted at work and they drove me to quit) and now I’m trying to find a new job that isn’t minimum wage but here’s the thing.... I have no idea what I wanna do with my life and I kinda don’t care... my brain is telling me not to apply because high paying jobs will not hire me because everyone thinks I’m stupid so they will think I’m stupid and not worthy and I can’t seem to shake that conditioning that I’m utterly useless and a waste of an existence.

I sleep because it makes reality go away for a few hours. Then I wake up and cry. I should be happy tho... my partner loves me and support me and they do make me happy.

My entire life I don’t think I’ve connected with anyone. I currently have a group of friends who like me, but I don’t feel the same way. I kind of view them as just the people I hang out with. There’s never been a point in my life where I was attracted to/ liked another person. Not a friend, s/o, or even a family member.

I genuinely don’t feel a lot of emotions (i think) when I feel depressed it’s not a sad feeling but a physical pain.  When feel anxious it’s more of a thought in my head than fear. And I haven’t felt anything resembling happiness in about 10 years, yet I’m in no hurry to see a therapist. 

I’ve had relationships before, but I’ve never felt any feeling of likeness towards them. I end up getting bored or them and moving on with no feeling of guilt or sympathy. At this point I’m worrying about being completely lonely for the rest of my life.

I just got insurance from work a month ago and immediately started seeing a therapist. I've only seen her twice but I found myself relieved just to have somebody to talk to. But I recently found out that the insurance plan I got is being replaced by a much cheaper plan that will cover anything until I meet my $3000 deductible, which effectively means therapy for me will end on January 1st. I desperately need professional help, I know that. But it seems like that's about to be gone just as I started.

I came here to rant about my emotional problems, so now I'm gonna do just that. I had a really shitty childhood. Until I was 12 I lived with my mother in a crackhouse during the week, then went to my dad's during the weekend where he beat me and my brother. When she went to prison I moved in with my dad and things were better until he went to prison 2 years later. Then my grandma took us in and I'm still living with her at 20. I haven't even gotten close to coping with that.

For as long as I can remember I've struggled with extreme depression and anxiety as well as mood swings. My therapist said that she is confident with a PTSD, depression, and GAD diagnosis. Maybe ADHD. I also find myself stuck in thought about existential issues like consciousness and what makes me, me. I often feel like life is fake somehow and obsessively think about that possibility. I float by in a fog and watch my life as if I'm watching a movie. It's right in front of me, but I can't reach out and interact with it. I'm trapped. Some nights I have panic attacks thinking about what hell would be like and the possibility of going there. I tearfully beg God to forgive me and speak to me. 

Now I'm going to community college and working at a group home overnight full time. I've been struggling with thoughts about never feeling better and being unable to become successful as a computer scientist. I can't even think about going for a bachelor's degree, school is too stressful for me. For now I will be happy to finish my associates degree. Working overnight has me feeling very lonely. I haven't talked to another human in 4 hours and I probably won't for another 5. My job is easy, but I can't even think about going. I can't remember the past 4 days.

57,"i was in a gifted program as a child and managed to achieve a 90 average with little effort. i mainly maintained this in grade 9 with a bit more effort put in. the lack of effort in elementary school and high grades caused me to be super picky with my grades along with general anxiety towards the thought of failing (even though im not). science this year has been really hard (i have a long term supply not trained in science) and my grade has been progressively dropping. (92-86) while those grades are still good, for someone who has a 94 average it completely stresses me out. weve been given our grades about 4 times, each time ive gone to my friend sighing, ""it dropped again"". my parents are really picky about my grades as well so its usually followed up by ""my parents will kill me"". 

we saw our grades today and i went to my friend as usually and she laughed it off. the guy who sits behind her and in front of me said (along the lines of) ""literally no one cares. the reason shes laughing at you is because she thinks its stupid. and everyone isnt stupid and knows its an amazing grade-"" it was an 86 which is the lowest grade ive gotten in high school and its really anxiety inducing for me ""-so can you please shut up about your grade because no one cares."" i know that im a really talkative person and most people find it annoying (myself included). ive been trying to talk less but when im talking to my friends its hard to not go off on random stories which others will hear. 

i have a crippling fear of being disliked by other people and faced it all through elementary school (pretty much all of my graduating class hated me) and obviously intense anxiety towards school. i try my best to tell myself that my grade is okay, and i know it is but deep down i cant help but feel like im failing.

Thank you for your time",13Dec2019,1
73,"I've been struggling with mental health issues since as early as I can remember. I don't really know where to start, so I guess I'll try to summarize my life.

I was born to two parents who never really seemed interested in parenting; they split up when I was 3 months old. My mom is the sweetest person on the planet and is the only person I can relate to emotionally, my father on the other hand was never really an influence in my life. When I was born, he didn't want to see me for the first few months. I saw him every other weekend, but he was never really a father figure, he didn't teach me much, he picked me up from school, dropped me off at my aunts farm until 8-10pm, went back to work, picked me up, made dinner, fin. I've always feared him to a large degree, feared him physically as a child and feared him mentally my entire life. He's highly critical, deprecating, ununderstanding, unempathetic, and like me and my mother, he has to be dealing with some serious mental health issues himself.

When I was 3-4, I was severely abused, I had my arm and leg broken. I have no idea who did it, my mother says it was the babysitter (who I have a bad memory with), my dad says it was my mother, and I've never wanted to ask anyone else, because I don't think I want to know, out of fear it was one of them. There have been multiple illusions to the fact that I may have been molested at that age too. I had no contact with a parent for 6 months multiple times before I was 16, I'm also a highschool dropout.

Growing up, I've always been different, in just about every single way, and I feel like my differences are almost all the wrongfully acceptable-to-mock attributes, such as height, skin color (pale), hair color (red + freckles), not the greatest looking, but not ugly, white. I also legitimately look about 6-8 years younger than I really am, and this has severely impacted me to the point of never having a relationship... at 23. I look far younger in every way, and honestly, maybe because of my traumatic life growing up, I feel like mentally and physically, I'm biologically delayed. And if I hear ""you'll appreciate when you're older"" one more time, im gonna blow.

To make this all worse, I'm constantly reminded anytime I vent that my problems aren't legitimate because they're not the worst. I'm short as fuck, but I'm not 5'3"", I'm made fun of for my hair and skin color, but I'm white so I have no right to complain, I grew up super poor, but I wasn't African poor.

I grew up poor and have struggled with severe mental health issues from as far back as I can remember, I've never felt like anyone really cared about me. I'm too nice and have been taken advantage of, lots. But when I try to gain some respect by being a little harder, I get called an asshole for trying to be more stoic, and that hurts me.

On the outside, I'm emotionally impenetrable, but on the inside, I'm fucking weak. Everything anyone says gets to me and hurts, I'm just extraordinarily good at hiding it, to the point that I convince myself for weeks sometimes that it really doesn't bother me.

There's something about the way I speak and conduct myself that people hate. I'm not trying to be an asshole, and if I say something asshole-like, I'm genuinely not trying to. But even online, something about me permeates and makes people hate me. I'm highly disagreeable (I'm extremely unbiased, to a fault), and no one understands what I'm really trying to say, people make TONS of assumptions about my characters and thoughts. No one cares about me, and no one cares that I feel this way.

I feel like no one other than my mother really cares about me, and even then, her own mental health issues make me feel like she doesn't sometimes.

The only reason I haven't killed myself is because I feel guilty putting that stress on my mother and sisters, who I'd do literally anything for. But if I did, I feel like maybe a dozen people would show up to my funeral, not just because I'm reclusive (which I am), but also because I feel like no one cares, I'm like a background character to everyone.

I can be personable, I can be likeable, I can be charismatic and cautiously funny, but it's all fake, it's all a really elaborate charade that makes me absolutely fucking miserable.

I've never seen a medical professional about my mental health issues.

I don't want to diagnose myself, but I definitely have severe depression and anxiety, and I'm 90% sure I have BPD and PTSD (multiple things in my life causing this).

I want things to get better, I want to enjoy life, but the things that cause me misery seem unfixable, my GLARINGLY obvious attributes that are constant hindrances in my life cannot be changed.

I feel like I'm finally accepting the logical need for death, I don't see a fix for my problems. Rarely things are good (maybe 1 day every 1-2 months), usually things are bad (25 days/month), and sometimes things are awful (2-4 days/month).

I need to fix this ASAP because the fork in the road is dead ahead and I'm leaning to the wrong side.

I hate my job, I'm exhausted every day, but it's as good as any other job I can get, I need things to change a LOT. One or two small things are not going to do it.

Where do I start? Therapist? Psychologist? What steps do I take after.

74,"I’m a 15 year old male. I have experienced a lot of loss in my life. My mom was addicted to drugs or in prison for most of my life, she has been clean for three years now.  I lived with my dad until I was 8 but then he died. After that I lived with my grandmother and grandfather. My grandfather was always at work and he didn’t talk much so I didn’t have much of a relationship with him. My grandmother died when I was 11. A week after that my other grandmother who I had a close relationship with also died. Shortly after that my mother who was clean at the time got back on drugs. I lived alone with my grandfather who was completely uninterested in my life, I have basically lived alone since I was 11. I gained a lot of weight and I spend almost all my time sleeping. I haven’t done homework in almost 5 years. I’m worried now because I can finally somewhat see a future for myself. Before now I always saw only the present moment, whenever I thought of the future it always seemed uncertain if I would even have one so I wouldn’t put any work towards it. It seems like every time I get put under stress I buckle and just give up.  I have no motivation to do anything. My grades have not been good in a long time. I have a very heavy course load with 3 AP courses and all honors courses.  I just don’t want this time period to have ruined my life.

my main symptoms:
-always fidgeting, shaking legs and nail biting
- always avoiding social events I know i will find i enjoyable / worrying, for example going to a friends party if no one else i know is going, or avoiding a work party because there are too many people
- even being worried about going to ask for help from teachers or shop employees and paying at the register
-always having to constantly check what others are doing or wearing for example when going to an event or somewhere , in fear i will be too different 
- always quiet in social situations because i’m afraid to fit in, and also leading to losing some friendships
-also always worrying about doing something wrong and what will happen to me, mostly about what people will think

I don’t care about how much older people are (oldest person was 33 years older than me), I don’t care how people look (I never found my ex attractive but it didn’t matter to me, I still felt like I really loved him), I don’t have much of a sexual drive but I do have random hookups (I had sex with 4 people, at different times, in one night even though I had no interest in it).

Mental health issues are promient in today’s society due to better health literacy and being able to recognise issues within ourselves, plus better access to services that can assist us in these issues.
Nobody with mental illness wants mental illness. People get diagnosed so they can get help. 
Your comment is ignorant and screams boomer.

112,"As the title says, I just said goodbye to one of the most trustworthy and best people I've ever know recently due to them moving away abroad. They have made me a better person during the years by just being there, I could always count on them on anything, and they thought me many important life lessons in the process as well.

*However*, despite having been sad and feeling empty for the whole day more or less, I feel like this is eventually for the best - not only can we still message now and then, but once we meet sometime we'll have more to talk; additionally, them being away will surely make me more independent and resilient (sometimes I relied on them and their assistance a little too much) and help me nourish my (few) relationships with other people.

I also know that my friend moving away was something they had dreamed of for couple of years already, so I'm super happy and proud for them.

TL;DR : Despite it now feeling bad, I feel that having to part ways (sort of) with a close friend is something my life will benefit from in the long run.",13Dec2019,1

114,"I have always had anxiety which has been so extreme till the point that I haven't had a proper emotional connection with anyone. No one including my family seems to understand me since I always have been to anxious to express myself in social situations. I didn't want to be judged by anyone at all. It started at the age of 13 were I hated when anyone would ask me a question, and I would even get panic attacks if it were too personal.

This all builded up to several months of constant anxiety attacks. I was scared of everything, and I cried like a baby constantly. I am a guy too so everyone assumed that I was disabled. I told my parents to call an ambulance several times which they eventually did. That didn't help though and I was still lost in constant anxiety. Now im 21 and I still haven't felt alive since before my first panic attack. I have managed to fake my personality however so that I at least seem human. But I haven't actually felt anything besides anxiety and a bit of depression.

I've gone to the cardiologist and the results came back 'normal', so I can only imagine I have my mental health to blame.

118,"(This post was accidentally deleted so I am posting it again. Apologies for reposting.)

It just shows us the magnitude of depression, anxiety and other mental disorders and illnesses. It shows us just how many people suffer from them.

Life is hard. Very hard, traumatising. The World is a dark place, so of course most people are affected and develop mental health problems. Why do people think the posts are lying?

It is very likely that millions, billions of people suffer from some form of mental disorder and go undiagonsed.

It also shows us that these people's problems are not taken seriously in real life so posting online is the only outlet they have. They are second guessed and feel suffocated, IRL.

People underestimate just how much mental disorders affect every aspect of life and daily functioning. People need to express that, so they post online.

There is stigma associated with mental issues, posting online is safer than talking about it in real life. Plus, IRL, their illness and weakness will be used against them, to harm them, as well. Some people will use it against them or take advantage of them.

They are already accused of making excuses, being told their problems are not real, of being lazy, looking for attention..... The list goes on... In real life. Hell they end up believing it themselves and blame themselves.

They are already hurting and this hurts them more. Then they get accused of similar things online. So it adds to their pain, hurt, frustration, trauma.

Please don't just one sidedly accuse people of attention seeking when they need to get stuff about their mental issues off their chest or want to be open/ honest about it.

If 1 person out of 50 is lying, do not second guess the other 49 becoz of that 1 person.

If you can, please give people who post about mental health issues the benefit of doubt.

If you are not sure if a post is genuine, ignore it. Don't upvote it, don't sympathize with them but don't bash them, downvote them and accuse them of lying or seeking attention, either.

121,"Hello everyone,

My name is Joe, I am a filmmaker from Connecticut and the creator of the series 'My Suicide Story' a YouTube series where I film survivors of attempted suicide and allow them to share their stories with the world. My hopes in creating this series are to hopefully deter someone who may be feeling the same feelings as some of the survivors in these videos and also to raise awareness and change the stigma the world holds on suicide.

Since creating this series back in 2018, I have received a ton of positive feedback and have received hundreds of people that have reached out saying that these videos helped them, that is the reason I am continuing the series.

I wanted to post this here to potentially help anyone who may be suffering from suicidal ideologies. I hope that if you are you can watch one of these videos and see that you are not alone in the way that you feel and that you can overcome those thoughts as each one of the survivors that I filmed has.

I myself do not suffer from suicidal ideologies or depression so I can't empathize with those of you who are suffering, and I do not want to be out of line by posting this here if it is offensive to anyone. If it is PLEASE let me know and I will gladly remove this post.

This series was born by accident when one of my best friends Kenny, told me that he tried to commit suicide when he was younger and how much he regretted it immediately after, which is the common factor in all of these stories. Kenny is a big, intimidating person (also the most humble person I have ever met) so when he told me this I was surprised when he told me this. For some reason when we see big, strong, tough people, we tend to assume they do not suffer like everyone else and that is the reason I decided to share his story.

After uploading his story to YouTube, people from across the country began reaching out requesting to share their stories in an episode and that is how this series was born.

I will link the youtube channel below for those of you who may need to hear what these survivors have to say. I would like to warn everyone here that these stores are not edited. They are raw and can be triggering, which is why I display a 10-15 second disclaimer prior to each video (as was requested by one of the survivors).

Again, if there is a consensus that this material is not suitable to be posted here, please do send me a message and I will take it down.

Thank you all for your time,

Joe

122,"Well I guess I should start at the top..I'm sorry about the lengthy read.
3 years ago I left a severely abusive relationship, it wasn't abusive till about 2 1/2 years into it. It went on for about 2 years after I started to realize it was abusive. He was my first everything, I was 15 when we got together and 20 when I left him, I didn't realize he was controlling and the physical aspect he always excused 'I did it because I don't want to to think poorly of yourself' I always just thought he wanted what's best for me... I was really naive and confused.
By the I realize it I felt so trapped, let me be clear: I thought about killing myself because I couldn't leave him. He threatened suicide or harming me if I ever left him. My family started noticing how depressed I had become, the distance between me and my family (whom I have always been VERY close with) and knew he was the cause. They all sat me down and had a sort of intervention, they saw it  before I could accept it.
The lack of attendance at family gatherings, Not visiting them because he was so controlling and had a horrible home life unlike myself. He couldn't understand why we were so close and he was jealous of the time I spent with them.
The things he would do I wont go into great detail about but I see now just how fucked up he was.
With my family's support, I left him and moved back home with my parents, I have been so absolutely blessed to have the parents and family I do.
It doesn't stop there though, he started following me. Everywhere. Absolutely fucking everywhere. Walmart, my job, friends homes, and MY home. I worked 2nd shift and he would wait for me to get off at 2am and follow me all the way out to my house 20 miles on the country to make sure I wasnt seeing anyone else.
This went on for 4 months, I couldn't get a restraining because I didn't have proof. He was always careful to not be seen on my work places cameras. He would text horrible then very sweet texts and calls dozens of times a day, text me through his little brothers and my friends phones after I blocked him....Then my friends.... turned their backs on me. They didn't believe me when I said he was abusive because he was careful not to show it in front of people..... All my friends left me...
 It took my two older brothers to get involved and talk to him to get him to leave me alone.
It's been 3 years since I was engaged, living with him, and in that horrible relationship.
I've been trying SO HARD to deal with it, things he did and said won't ever make sense to me. I've finally accepted the fact that I developed serious anxiety and depression after all of this, as well as a sense of paranoia...I think?
I've never been to a therapist or been on medication for this but I can't function normally anymore. I can't do anything, chores, be with my family, have a relationship. It's too much all the time, I just don't want to feel so fucking awful all the time.
Is there anyone here that has positive experiences with therapists for issues like this? Maybe a direction I could start at? Medications that could be suggested maybe? Any piece of advice how I move forward... would be very much appreciated ❤ Thanks for reading through all that haha",13Dec2019,1

I've been on holidays for about a month now, and not one of my friends has made any effort to see me, I haven't left my house, my confidence has gone down so much and every friendship I have feels one-sided, I live with only my mum, but me and her aren't close at all because I'm gay, not because she's homophobic, I'm out, but because I don't feel comfortable being myself around her. I just feel so stupidly lonely, I don't live in a massive city, maybe 100,000 people, still a city but everyone seems to know everyone and I can't see myself meeting many new people I haven't already met. Im a very social person, very extroverted, friendly and not like ""weird"" or ""ugly"" anything, although those terms are stupid, but I'm very used to being liked and surrounded by friends, almost to make up for the fact I don't feel like I really have much of a family, but lately I just feel so alone and isolated, I don't have a job anymore, I quit to focus on school and haven't been able to find one since school finished, I don't know what to do. My sleep schedule has shifted, most nights I fall asleep around 5am and wake up around 2, I spend all my time bored on the internet, every time I try to talk to people in my life or spend time with them they say theyre busy, which feels like an excuse not to see me, I've felt myself sink lower and lower into what my GP said was depression, but I refuse to take antidepressants and councilors aren't working. I don't know what to do and I'm scared that at this rate I won't make it to 2020, suicidal thoughts are turning into suicidal hours and I feel completely numb, not even sad just numb and unmotivated and lonley.

126,"I have been struggling pretty badly for many years now (around 16 years at least). At first I had no real idea or knowledge of what I was experiencing or that I should look for help. Over time things got worse and worse, I began seeking out methods for help. Unfortunately I never really had much success, have done talk therapy on and off for around 7 years now. Also during that time have seen doctors and gone through at least 8 different medications (which really didn't seem to help as well, in fact some of the side effects were pretty detrimental).

During all of this time I felt more and more that I was completely disoriented, walking around dazed/in a fog so to speak. I was able to work and that I did, high stress field and extremely long hours. All with a boss who certainly took advantage of my work ethic, and since I had no idea how to stand up for myself or set boundaries that spiraled. During this my ability to handle other normal tasks in my life declined more and more to the point where I was not really taking care of myself/home. Of course that in turn contributed further to the mental issues.

I pretty much had a breakdown late last year/early this year and it's been a nightmare. I'm not working, and also have absolutely zero desire to go back into the only field I know. I feel almost traumatized by it to be honest. Obviously though, I need to do something or else I'll soon be homeless or dead likely.

I've desperately been trying to work on myself, reading various self-help things/meditating/journaling. Trying again to go to talk therapy but I can't afford it so having to try through my local city resources but they apparently can only seem me like once a month if that. I've been almost completely unable to do things, days of not being able to get out of bed. Crying, feeling more hopeless and suicidal than ever.

I have taken the tactic of just trying to do whatever little bit I can in a day, whether that's just washing some dishes or such. This has helped, I've slowly made more progress and been able to do a little more. However what is left still feels insurmountable. I have to actually try to not think about it otherwise I start to break down again.

I desperately want to cling onto this tiny bit of progress but the feeling of impending doom is hanging over my head. Slightest misstep and I'll tumble into the abyss never to return. Had to sit down just now as all of this has been whirling through my head and I'm at the point of tears again.

So lonely, no one to really talk to, no friends and no support. I wouldn't even know where to search that out at this point to be honest and not even sure that I could considering all the past ones abandoned me.",13Dec2019,1
127,"My roommate has been struggling with what she calls the worst depression of her life, and told me sometime last week that she’s the closest she’s ever been to cutting or committing suicide. I asked her what I could do to help but she didn’t know. I have struggled with depression myself, and I had a suicide attempt a few years ago, but currently I’m doing quite well, and I’m trying desperately to hold onto that. 

So Wednesday night, my roommate snap chatted me saying she was drunk, alone, at 5 pm. I got so frustrated because we both KNOW that drinking especially on a week night is a terrible coping mechanism. I didn’t respond and went straight to my room when I got home, and cried in my bed for like, 2 hours. Silently, because she was in the other room. I got up to get some water and told her I was going to sleep, she asked if everything was okay (because I’d obviously been crying) and I said that I was fine. How am I supposed to tell her that she’s not allowed to be depressed because it makes me depressed? That night I fell asleep going over my CPR and first aid training in my head to make sure I would know what to do if she attempted something. 

Fast forward to last night, I got drunk at work with my boss which was SUPER FUN and I was really feeling myself when I got home, so I had a bit more to drink on an empty stomach and suddenly was...completely wasted. I started fixating on my roommate and her problems (which I do a little of when I’m sober, because she’s about all of my social circle right now besides work) and then she came home and I just asked her outright, “are you going to kill yourself? Do I need to worry about you killing yourself when I’m asleep?” And she said no and went straight to bed. I sent her a text that said “I had a great night, thanks for asking.” Then I called my other best friend and cried for a long time, she basically got me to go to bed and sleep it off. 

This morning I woke up and my roommates car was still here, when she normally goes to class. I got up and had breakfast and was playing music and stuff, when she came out I said “good morning” and she didn’t respond. She stormed out the door without saying anything and then I got a text that said “I’ll be back Monday, enjoy the apartment.” I haven’t responded, and I’ve texted my other friend for advice, but I don’t know if I need to do something else....call her parents? Call the police?? I don’t know to believe her when she said she wasn’t going to kill herself, and if she was planning something this guarantees that I wouldn’t start to worry until Monday. So I just don’t know what to do. I think she may have gone to stay with some family friends nearby, but I don’t have their info so I can’t contact them. 

Please advise! What can I do? Did I do something wrong here? Or am I making this out to be something bigger than it actually is?? I really need advice. Thank you ❤️",13Dec2019,1
128,"*I'm sorry if I'm posting this in the wrong subreddit - it does cross over a couple of subjects, but I think the heart of the issue is mental health. Also, I'm not seeking advice for myself directly, but how to address someone else's mental health.*

My father is 63, currently unemployed, and has been dealing with kidney failure and diabetes for the last 20+ years or so. His health has recently plummeted, he's started drinking - and my family and I are concerned.

***A Little Dad History:***

Dad's currently living with my older sister, however she is not like a qualified care giver (by her own admission, too.). Dad's been in and out of the hospital for various reasons, usually it's because he doesn't drink any water and he's severely dehydrated. They give him an IV, some hospital chow and he goes back to his life for another 3 months. Dad's also had cancer due to his kidney transplant rejection medication (that's a known side effect, nice right?). Dad eats poorly, especially for someone with diabetes - I've witnessed him eat a whole loaf of garlic bread in one sitting. He's rail thin, his skin has a grey wash, and is the texture of crepe paper. Literally leaves the kitchen when anything green comes out. Dad is recently unemployed - he quit working as a grocery store maintenance guy to find something that wasn't as physical. He started working at an Amazon fulfillment center (I don't think that's less physical tbh), but due to recent events no longer works there either. Dad is only 63, and there are people 10-15 years older than him that seem 10-15 years younger than him. He doesn't have a lot of friends, or any real hobbies. Dad's mom died almost two years ago, her death was very hard on him, and he doesn't have much for extended familial relationships (his cousins/siblings, etc). And he's struggled with depression/self worth issues/suicidal thoughts in the past.

***Events Leading to This Post:***

The Wednesday before Thanksgiving, my family in his area (I'm out of state) had a gathering and my youngest sister and SIL both mentioned to my older sister how rough Dad was looking. His face was more gaunt than usual - his eyes looked sunken in, and he was stumbling a lot. After dinner, he insisted in joining them for a glass of wine. 

*\*\*\*\*My father, to my knowledge hasn't had a drink in years. As far as I know, it's very bad for him, both as a diabetic and kidney transplant recipient to be drinking. So I mean like 20 years of no drinking.\*\*\*\**

Dad ends up going to the hospital that night after my family's urging. The night he checked in the PA asked my sister what our plan was in case he died over night. He survives the night, and stays over in the hospital for a few days, but he doctors tell my sister that he as cirrhosis of the liver, renal failure and kidney failure (again).  While all this is going on, ,my sister is also trying to move out of her house, and needed to clean up his room while he was gone - for a showing. When she cleaned up she found a BUNCH of empty alcohol bottles - a couple of 6 packs, a box stacked with bottles, and a large expensive champagne bottle. Dad's been home for a little over a week, and she's not approached him about it. He's been telling everyone he's fine and to leave him alone... except once in a while he will let a comment like ""*well, I'll probably just die*"" slip to my younger sister or my sister's kids. 

My take on all of this is that Dad's intentionally sabotaging his health with alcohol as either a cry for help, a coping mechanism, and/or a passive suicide method. I don't know how to handle this - neither does my sister. I realize he's an adult, and can ""live his life"" - but this is also crossing some boundaries for my sister and her kids. ...I never thought I'd have to talk to a parent about their self harm.",13Dec2019,1
129,"I’ve been on: 

Prozac (stopped working), tegretol (basically useless), lamictal (gave me corneal abrasions as my eyes were so dry), Xanax, klonopin, Ativan, abilify (made me psychotic), depakote (made me piss myself),  zyprexa (gained 30 fucking pounds), saphris (made me an exhausted idiot), geodon (didn’t do shit), cymbalta (made me incredibly dizzy for a year), trazadone (very allergic), seroquel (gained 20 lbs), Vraylar (made me talk with a lisp for two weeks), Wellbutrin (made me angry and anxious) and probably more.

...yeah. I’m bipolar 1 with psychosis. 

But guess what. I’ve been on meds.... almost ten years now. Almost exactly 9 years.

Side effects suck, dude. As you can see. I’m violently allergic to trazadone. Abilify made me psychotic. They suck. I get it. I get you don’t want to take them. I get that you’re afraid. I get you don’t want side effects. I get it all.

Every single one of those meds (besides benzos which are really more of a band aid for a bad panic attack), gave me side effects or no effects.

I get why you’re scared.

Despite gaining twenty pounds (which to be honest, were needed as I was underweight) and speaking with a lisp and having facial twitches for a few weeks, Vraylar and seroquel have kept me stabler than ever.

What does that mean? 

It means that sometimes you have to get through unpleasant side effects to experience the good parts of the drug. It means sometimes meds don’t work for you, but you gotta keep trying.

Misconceptions on mental meds are terrible. I get it.
People judge you. People say “why don’t you just go hiking and eat healthy?” People say “medications are just a crutch”.

When you break your leg, though, you *need* a goddamn crutch. Nobody judges you when your femur is broken in half, because we can *all* imagine what it’s like to have a femur that’s snapped. 

Not everyone can imagine depression or mental health issues, for whatever reason, but it’s just as real as having a broken leg. You’re not lazy or stupid or weak for having depression. It’s that some people can’t imagine it. Genuinely. Kind of like someone can’t imagine what it’s like to be pregnant if they’ve never been pregnant. Or desperately poor if they’ve never been poor. You can think you get it, but you don’t.

Keep taking your meds. Keep fighting. Keep trying. Mental health care is only going to get better. There are only going to be more options a year, two years, ten years from now.",13Dec2019,1
130,"This is my first post on this subreddit, and I hope to find help from others who can relate to these experiences that I’ve had, or can help me understand what might be going on. Please note that I am not anti-weed, this is just a personal experience.

I’ll start off talking about my mental health in the past and today. When I was much younger, during early childhood, I had anger problems and was very very particular about things, a problem that went unaddressed. I believe this has to do with OCD-like symptoms which eventually, as I got older developed into OCD. Initially, I was just diagnosed with anxiety, but later on around 7th grade I began having OCD which manifested in the form of doing things in 3’s, hand washing, reorganizing things at the dinner table, misophonia (which I still have today), touch sensitivity to certain materials as well as general anxiety. 
Fast forward to today, I no longer have OCD symptoms, which I overcame on my own simply by going against the grain over and over until I no longer felt like I was obligated to do these rituals. I’m 18 now and for the past few years I’ve had pretty bad anxiety (which occurs throughout the day and manifests itself in multiple ways) of with bouts of depression an inability to function. I still have residual anger problems which I have founds ways to overcome.
But what is more alarming are the psychotic-like warning signs I have experienced throughout my life. Every since I was a young kid, at times I would have bizarre thoughts, such as in 6th grade I thought one of my teachers could read my mind and I convinced myself that she was evil. I’ve also had many bizarre abstract intrusive thoughts especially when I had OCD, and even still today, but I’m unsure if this is a red flag. Regardless, I’ll explain an experience I had last December.
From about the age 16 onward I would smoke weed on occasion, which was during a time when I was craving feeling better emotionally and finding sone kind of escape, I drank and got myself into some trouble. Anyways, whenever I would smoke weed, I would always have a panic attack, I felt like I was acting strangely and said weird things, I had mild hallucinations, and would close my eyes and see and hear all of these crazy things happening in my mind. Anything from visuals of a chaotic cartoon, to geometric shapes, all while my heart in pounding during this panic. I only ever smoked 4 times, each time was a horrible experience, until last December when I had a full on psychotic episode.
I was with a few friends and took a hit off of a bong in their car, and immediately began to feel anxiety and my heart racing extremely fast. I began to convince myself I was dying, until I passed out, and saw this very strange geometric pattern replete itself while my eyes were closed. At this point I could feel my heart skipping beats as I began to pass out more. At this point I convinced myself that I had actually died, and I woke up, and this is when the psychotic symptoms began to take place. Everything was extremely slow motion, I looked out the window and the outside environment had a green glow (it was night-time) and looked all smoky. During the next hour or so, it felt like 24 hours as I had convinced myself that I had died, I was in hell, and would be trapped in this car for eternity. I had feelings of absolute dread and despair, as it felt like I was stuck there for eternity, and it appeared like everyone in the car was completely picture-still. The song on the radio (burn out by midland) was playing and it seemed like it never ended. I felt like the song was mocking me and in my mind I was changing the lyrics to have some greater meaning, and that it was talking about how I was trapped forever and I sealed my fait. There was a point where my friend in the passenger seat turned around and said “Welcome to hell. Make yourself at home because there’s no going back” or something to that degree, moved his head back toward and became dead still again. Seconds still felt like hours, and my mind was RACING with terrible thoughts and emotions about being trapped for eternity, and I felt such terrible emotions that I never felt in my life, complete helplessness and regret. I truly thought I had died and was in hell. I got out of their car, walked over to a random house and called 911 as I was walking over to it. I knocked on their door and the sound of the dog barking morphed into terrible screaming sounds. I was barley able to communicate with these poor people who were probably scared and confused, but I’m sure I got some kind of message through that I needed help, and they called an ambulance as well. My delusions made me think of them as Jesus and Mary. Sounds ridiculous but this all made sense in my mind. I got picked up by the ambulance, and as soon as I got into the enclosed vehicle the feeling of being stuck forever came back, and I remember looking out the window at a time and temperature clock and it said “666” for the time. I ended up getting an IV and my heart rate was in the 200’s. I could go on and on about the emotions and delusions I had that night, which was the worst in my life, but simply make an already long story short, I experienced short term symptoms of religious delusions, hallucinations, thought loops, and depersonalization from one hit off of a bong. Now, I know the weed was not laced because everyone else in the car was A-Okay, and I know where the weed came from.
The weeks following this incident I was definitely not myself. I remember being extremely paranoid of other people, I listened into my dads phone call thinking he was talking about me, and one day while going out to dinner with my mom and step dad, I remember staring at him, and getting depressed because I thought he hated me, when I had no reason to think this. 
Following this incident I did lots of research about weed and short term psychosis. I uploaded a file of my 23andme genome (a genetic ancestry and health test website) to a health website called promethesss and discovered I have ATK1, a gene responsible for causing a psychotic response to cannabis in some people. I still have lots of questions unanswered, such as, does this mean I am at a higher risk of developing schizophrenia? I know I will certainly not smoke weed again, that’s a given.
Sorry if these all seems like I’m going on a tangent but I typed this on my phone quickly, and it’s hard for me to talk about. I appreciate any input from others on this subreddit, who would like to share their experiences with weed and mental illness, or if you guys can help me know what’s going on in my head. Than you!",13Dec2019,1
131,"I'm feeling pretty foggy and incoherent compared to usual so I'm just going to write and hope that it makes sense.

I'm currently working a job that is sucking the absolute life out me. I took this job as it genuinely sounded promising and my partner and I had just moved to my home country from Europe, so we're still getting on our feet.  

Earlier in the year I started a side business which I'm still operating and intend to grow to replace my full time income, but a few months ago my partner lost her job and is struggling to find another.

I feel trapped. I have grown to loathe my job and it feels like I've taken two steps backwards. In Europe I was working higher level corporate jobs and had so much more responsibility, now I work in a role that's so boring and the people around me are so generic and fake that I'm literally dying inside every minute I'm there. I have tried to be reasonable and tell my boss I'm not stimulated, I have tried to propose things to improve the business and show my value in hopes of gaining more responsibility, but to no avail.

The worst part about all this is that I am feeling resentment towards my partner for not working, because then I would just quit and focus on growing my side business, and I feel guilt because I feel resentment. It's not her fucking fault but god damn it I can't physically do this any longer or I think I'm going to spontaneously combust. When I get home I'm exhausted even though I don't do anything challenging or tiring at work. I don't want to eat, and even though I try to get hours of sleep, my brain wakes me up after 5 and I just lay there every morning feeling anxious until I force myself out of bed to go to what has become my own personal hell on Earth.

I've toughed out shitty jobs before out of necessity, but I've grown too much and become too ambitious to settle for it any longer. Being mediocre in a professional sense is quite literally ruining my life right now.",13Dec2019,1
132,"Hi.
So I have this problem with my emotions and all. 4 months ago I broke up with my (back then) bf. We didn't stop to talk thought and for all that time he was giving me clear signs that he still has feelings for me.

We broke up because I started realizing that he was a really manipulative person and, probably, he just kept on playing with my emotions for those 4 months.

So two weeks ago we had this call when I told him I still care and basically that I could start this relationship again. He told me he was waiting for me for that whole time (said it as in 'i'm clean' which would mean he didn't do anything with any girl). We met few days later, had a serious talk, it was mostly him accusing me of being the bad side in the relationship. Eventually we got drunk and slept with each other. And when we did it, he said he slept with one girl. One day after we called.

That completely destroyed me and since then I kinda struggle with everything I have to do. I just want to stay asleep all the time but I wake up every night few times. And I feel that pain in my chest.
But I was looking for help. Online. Reading stupid articles about how to move on, how to get over someone. And they said that you shouldn't 'use' people when you're trying to move on. But people make me feel better. I don't think about what happened when I'm with anyone. I feel happier when there's someone who doesn't know about my current emotional breakdown and doesn't try to talk about it.

So is it right or wrong to go to spend time with people to forget about these feelings for some time? Is it better to think this through, accept what happened? 

I wouldn't be posting if I had friends to talk to. Don't judge me, I just don't know how to deal with this. It's the first time ever I feel so extremely hurt.",13Dec2019,1

i hope someone can understand what  i mean by that. right, so how can i stop listening to these bands? im finding it very difficult. certain moods can trigger it/or something else i associate with that period/music and i go back there and stay there for a bit and it sucks. i think im happy there but i am not. i feel like ive stepped back in life, and returned to where i was most depressed.

Last year he was on the edge... suicidal ideation, self harm, spouting crazy talk about god and end times... he got institutionalized and after trying many things, they found that Depakote turned him back into a loving, wonderful, productive member of society and sent him back out into the world.  He spent a year doing well, but then decided to move to Louisiana to pursue some dreams and for a change of pace. 

Fast forward to now, he's having a hard time getting help, and has run out of meds.  He's starting to slide back into some familiar behaviors and I can see he's going to be having issues, pushing people away with his behavior and maybe sleeping out in the street soon.

I have been dealing with deppresion and anxiety for probably a year from now and for the last 14 days a can finnaly see a difference. I feel great! I dont have as much negative thoughts as i used to have, I dont abuse myself for not being good enought or not productive etc. I really got into self improvement and it really boosted my confidence + we have a therapist in our family so that REALLY helped me too. I even built up the courage and asked my crush out for a date (she said Yes :) ). So yeah, life is good now.

But for the past month I saw that my friend has been dealing with the sort of things that I had been dealing in the past. He has a lot of anxiety and negative thoughts which leads him into endless deppressions. I dont want him to be as unhappy and unmotivated as I used to be and I really want to help him but I cant remmember whitch thing helped me the most. 

Since he is far from our town, he cannot come here and get a session with the therapist I went to. I have no idea what advice to give him and I feel bad becouse I literally cant figure out why I am happy again.

She pushed us to do our best and helped us along every step of the way. All my peers were  amazing as well. Her class was overall fantastic.

With that being said, she has this presentation to give on Monday and planned to practice on us our last day in her class. The presentation was on mental strength and she shared her personal experiences with this topic. She was so nervous and she came off very vulnerable. It wasn’t something we were used to seeing at all. She usually had this confidence and she was really good at speaking but that day was different. 

She opened up about her experience with domestic abuse, having to live in a shelter with her two sons who were very young. She got out of that situation and tried making the best of what she was given. She always talked about her sons with us and it was nice hearing about them.

Well, yesterday she opened up about one of her sons, her youngest I believe, how he went to move with his dad in another state. How he changed a lot during his time there. How he was questioning things, how he was apologizing constantly. She didn’t know where it was coming from. Because he was an extremely intelligent person and she always let them know they were capable of anything and so much more. Her son was following the wrong crowd with drinking and smoking weed. Apparently he had been diagnosed with anxiety and was on medication because of it.

Earlier this year, her son ended his life. Hearing about it was absolutely heartbreaking. Seeing her so heartbroken was just so heart wrenching. I had to give her a hug and thanked her for a wonderful semester. But I emailed her and told her how much she has done for us. I feel so sad about it now.

147," Right now I'm at this type of crossroad where I'm not sure if general anxiety is the only thing going on with me. I've been taking medication for roughly 5yrs straight (Sertraline 100mg). I really don't remember exactly how i was as a person or how i would feel inside before i started medication. 

 A few things that i deal with on a regular basis is the fact that i never sit still, very forgetful, lack of motivation, and irritability. My interests change all the time too like one thing i like to do is watch YouTube videos and i went from watching videos on ""living off the land""(survival, making a fire,edible plants, etc) and randomly dropped watching those videos to watching nothing but paranormal stuff, then an interest in bikes. These things effect me outside of just watching the videos like wanting to go out in the woods or thinking about paranormal stuff at night contemplating on buying a road bike and just riding it to work and back. 

I also have issues speaking to people at times. Its not the actual thought of talking to people(that i know or strangers) it's the way i go about communicating. Like I'll stutter or stammer as i talk here and there and pause between sentences or mid sentence quite often. It's almost like i start talking before my brain processes what I'm trying to say even though i think about the point I'm trying to make in advance. One thing people know about med is that when i talk about my weekend or my thought on something i say way more than what i need to or that i just don't get to three point. There's a lot of times too that when I'm done talking people don't even know what I'm talking about. 

I know that was long-winded but those are some of the things that come to mind. I feel as if I was given medication for general anxiety a while back but that's not exactly my only issue. I've read about being diagnosed with anxiety disorder but actually having ADHD. I just wanted to pick everyone's brain on the subject and see if anyone can relate or may be able to share their story of what they've experienced or what they know.",13Dec2019,1

I sometimes like to just think about random things and dream but at this point, every time I'm not doing something that takes over my mind completely I just wander off to this endless circle of existencial questions.

 Yesterday I almost threw up on the bus I was going on because I had a sudden thought about existence. The same happened today while I was cooking and had a knife in my hand. I felt a sudden urge to stab myself in the head to just stop thinking about those things. 

They are terrifying. They are the scariest thing I could think of. I'm also very scared of death.

The first thing I'd like to say to all of you struggling is that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, even though you can't see it yet.

I want to know if anyone else struggled with the same kind of problems, so there we go:

My parents got a divorce when I was 4, and although I don’t remember the specifics, I know my dad has always had an aggressive personality. My mom has always tried to hide their fights to spare me the sadness. He's never had an active role in my life and would show up from time to time to take me to restaurants and try to show off how good he was doing (financially speaking).

I’ve since childhood known of my interest in girls, which I suppressed until the age of 20, when I finally came out as a lesbian. Instead of accepting the fact that I’ve never really felt sexually attracted to men, I sought men’s approval for the longest time and wanted to see myself as straight, fearing my family and acquaintances’ thoughts of me.

My mom has always tried to make sure I always had anything I could possibly need (in terms of goods), but I still subconsciously feel the effects of my dad’s abandonment until now. I’ve developed low self-esteem/confidence, fear of abandonment/need of attention, fear of being vulnerable to develop meaningful relationships, lack of a strong personality and became a people pleaser. I also lack motivation to seek challenges and strive to be as good as I possibly can. I can play instruments, code, but am not passionate about nearly anything.

Mental heath is a sensitive topic, at leaset on my moms side of the family and even more on her moms side. I never really been professionally diagnosed with anything besides depression sorta cause of the stigma around it. Like there's is just a so much things that could back up really serious mental issues, namely ptsd, that has just been ignored due to pride.
I could list all of the issues from my moms side if any anyone requests it but there are a lot of causes that cause the effect and a lot could be triggering for some. 
But I have been rececently medicated at the beginning of this year for anxiety which in turn what they thought fueled my depression. Which has helped a lot with clearing my mind and helping me focus on other things.... Which kinda backfired. Because of the clearer mind I was then able to actually think about traumatic events that happened in the past, things that cause childhood mental stress, and just things that my anxiety for the most part suppressed for so many years. It's really hard to take it all in at the same time. Things I havent thought about in ages and are just coming back all at once. I kinda wanna like make a timeline of everything that lead up to how i am today but again could be triggering to some and don't want to out right throw it at someone innocently reading. Again, might do it if people ask but like at work rn and don't have time to go ham on one at the moment. 
It just sucks. cause if I have suffered like this and others in the past did as well, would my future kids too? I worry about that a lot as well. Cause if I can't understand what is happening with me, how can I help them understand what's happening to them? Most kids look up to their parents as role models but like I don't want them have a role model who just doesn't know how to cope with how they are feeling and some mental war in their head that doesn't feel like it's real sometimes. Sometimes it feels made up. Like I made it up just for myself for attention.

164,"So I know how debilitating anxiety can be. I've had a handful of anxiety attacks, as well as having anxiety about things like driving and meeting new people, but have mostly found mental strength to overcome those on a daily basis.

So I always kind of knew it could be tough to go through, but to me anxiety was always something conquerable. Without going into too many details, I'm no longer in contact with someone very important to me, because she lied to me about a lot of very serious things and I think it's because she couldn't overcome her severe anxiety about it.

How can I better communicate with people that don't want to talk because of their anxiety?",13Dec2019,1
165,"I’ll start by saying I wouldn’t call my mother a narcissist. But I can heavily relate to almost every post on this subreddit and thought.. what better group of people will understand the hardships of being raised by people who do selfish things, than here? My mother and I have been having loads of arguments since September. I started realizing everything she’s ever done, all the awful things she’s said that no mother should say to their child, all the awful things she’s done, her manipulation, gaslighting, all of it. She blames me turning 18 for having “turned” on her. I think I just started becoming more independent and she got scared. She kept me dependent on her forever. I developed slowly because of this. And whenever she was upset with me, she’d leave me to fend for myself, and rub it in my face how I need her to live. But that’s a story for another post. Today, I went to her asking if she can call the school I want to go to for me (I have phone anxiety), she said she’s not paying for it, I said “okay, I’ll use my money.” The money I get from the government for my mental health, that can very well be used for big life things like this. She said “oh yeah, I spent $3000.” And I got mad, because this isn’t the first time she threatened to spend my money, or even spent it, last week she spent over 100 on Christmas presents, imagine that!! Spending money that was given to your mentally ill child for Christmas presents, for toys! And a massage chair! I told her I want her to pay me all of the money she spent back, and she said “no, you told me I can have it, remember?” And I did, I said that out of anger when she was threatening to spend it all two weeks ago. I just wanted the money gone. But I was angry, I wasn’t thinking, I NEED that money. Especially if I ever want to leave her. I managed to get $500 from her two months before she turned into such an uncaring demon. I knew something like this would happen. So I took what I could get. $500. And that’s it. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to tell anyone in my mother, she’s pregnant, she has five other kids. I don’t want anything bad to happen to her or them if I bring this to someone’s attention. I’m sure you guys will understand. But I don’t know what I can do. I thought everything was finally going back to normal, but she goes back to threatening my money again.",13Dec2019,1
166,"I’m a sophomore in college with depression/anxiety/ADHD and medicated for all of them. Depression/anxiety official diagnosis a little over a year ago, but with symptoms and suspicions from myself and people close to me that it’s been going on a lot longer, with the crippling anxiety starting in childhood. Diagnosed with ADHD at 8, now I’m 20. I’m the poster child for the honor roll Hugh-school student who crashes and burns in college. It’s hard. It awful. Some days I sleep until 5 and some days I get up but I still avoid any real work because I’m either too far behind to understand or I’m to anxious to start. Some days it feels like I just don’t do it because I don’t want to, some days it feels like I just can’t muster the effort to even read an assignment. I have so much due in the next few hours and weeks. I feel like human garbage. I feel like my conditions are the root of my problems, but that I personally am not doing enough. I’m not trying hard enough. I’m not following through enough. I feel so alone that I latch onto the few people in my life that make me feel safe and enjoyed and appreciated. I don’t even know what else to say, I would just really appreciate if someone else going through this could say they are. I feel like I’m the only one. I feel like all of my labels are just excuses. I feel like I’m taking advantage of accommodations for this stuff at school. I feel like I have a cycle of steadily falling behind because I’m just lazy then hitting rock bottom and overhauling my life with planners and regimens that never last for more than a few weeks. I feel like the people I love are out of advice. They still love me, but all they say now is that they’re sorry and that it’s going to be okay. How is it going to be okay if I’ve never been able to make it okay. I just feel alone and disappointed in myself. I don’t have anyone in my life with similar symptoms except for one person who I’m not close enough to to talk about it yet. Could really use some comments, literally anything, from people going through something similar. I just want to know that I’m not the only one feeling this way.

My three closest friends stopped talking to me this year, I dropped out of school, and live alone. like I could go to a hospital but they dont really give you reasons to live.  I was already in a top hospital for two months this summer and it didnt really help.  I just honestly dont want to live and the only thing stopping me is the fear of pain but that probably wont last long.  and i know the whole it’s temporary but its already taken over half my life and the other half i don’t remember because i was too young.",13Dec2019,1

169,"I've been waiting 2 months now, and it isn't until the end of January. Yes it's getting closer but after 2 months of being told to keep it together I really can't. I have never been to a psychiatrist, I had a family doctor who was TRYING to fix me but failed miserably. Never knew he wasn't even supposed to treat me, but he did anyway so there's no point in being pissed now. He had me on pristiq, clonozopam, I don't remember the other names but we've gone through nearly 5 trial and errors with my mental health within the last 2 years. He said I have; major depressive disorder, depression, no depression, serotonin deficiency, just family issues, no family issues. It seems like a guessing game at this point. I don't even know what's wrong with me. I went to a therapist once and it went horribly, I don't know if I'm willing to go again. If it's what I need then I'll go but I'm not putting up with a bullshit therapist again. I've called nearly daily to see about any openings sooner and cancellations but every day they tell me no. I couldn't get in anywhere else in my city because they don't want people with insurance or the kind of insurance I have (blue cross). I can't talk to anybody about anything. Everyday I bottle everything up and just keep telling myself the appointment is coming it'll get fixed soon but no, really I don't think it will. I am beyond depressed. Nobody fucking cares. They will care when it's to late and that's always how it is, nobody gives a shit until it's to late. How about we take this as a hint DONT MAKE PEOPLE PUT OFF THEIR MENTAL HEALTH FOR MONTHS.

171,"I’ve recently gone through a break up with someone  I’ve been on and off for 10 months. Was quite toxic as he would say horrible things about my body when angry and then would the nicest person normally. We were off and on none stop and I never knew where I stood. He broke up with me a Month ago as he said he didn’t have feelings but I still want him and would take him back if given the opportunity even though I know I shouldn’t. Since the breakup I’ve felt so alone and unloved I’ve been depressed before but it felt different than this, I recently been starving myself to the point where I feel like I’m going to faint, even though I was the biggest foodie of life but the thought of food now makes me want to be sick and when I eat I have to force feed myself. I Was also sick on a night out the other day and it felt so good and I want to make myself sick again to feel as good as I felt at the time. I know that’s such a weird thing to feel as I hate throwing up so much but I just wonder around everyday feeling so down and my body just wont let me cry so to throw up and physically see the pain I feel makes me feel good. Is this a normal thing? I know the situation seems so pathetic especially over some boy I wasn’t even with for a year but I think he just started how I feel and now I can’t seem to get rid of it.  Can you let me know if you’ve ever experienced this or let me know how to get over this guy so I can actually live my life again and enjoy things.

175,So I'm sure that it is normal to feel anxiety before starting a new job however I feel like my life is going to be consumed by work. These past few days I have heard nothing but people telling me that my life is literally going to become nothing but work and that I'm going to lose my friends and basically have no time for anything fun ever.

Recently I've begun to wonder if my honesty surrounding substance abuse is hindering my treatment options and how serious I am taken when I meet potential therapists.

178,"This is rather embarassing considering that I am a senior, but I am too afraid to go talk to my school counselor. I always feel like my problems are very small, that I am rotten spoiled and should not waste her time when there are kids in my school that have actual problems and had rough childhoods compared to me. Even if I went, what would I say? I feel like like anything I would say would come out whiny + I really do not know what I would have to say to her.
My mother does not agree to me seeing a psychologist because she believes that I am spoiled (which I agree with, unfortunately) and self harm because I am ""bored"". Paying to see a psychologist seems too expensive for me to handle (that and I would be too anxious and unsure to seek one out).",13Dec2019,1
179,"Hi everyone. I've really been struggling with anxiety and depression for a while now. I started a few university courses and never got them anywhere because I barely have any motivation to get out of bed let alone do work. I had a few jobs but quit them because I wasn't feeling okay or because my boss kinda hinted at me this might not be the place for me.
I just want to get out of society (or atleast my part of it) and reset for a while.

I thought about commiting my self in psychiatry but idk if that'll be a prodouctive enviroment for me. Working odd jobs stresses me out and I don't have the perseverance to finish an eduction. Idk what to do.
I just panick about everything and see my life fail as soon as something little goes wrong.

Anyone know a good way to reset? I wish I could just start a new life but obviously I can't so what' s the closest I can get? Any advice.
Feel free to ask more questions, thanks in advance.",13Dec2019,1

181,"I don't wanna make this long but I do wanna give a little back story this year has been my breaking point and after some suicide attemps the just thinking about them makes me hate myself, I was  hospitalized in a couple different psychiatric hospitals 8 times ranging from 2 months to 3 days. I seen countless doctors, therapists, counselors, and psychiatrists.  I've been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, psychosis, anxiety , major depression disorder and an eating disorder all within this year.  Every single time I talk with any type of doctor they fire me as a patient for liability issues or because I'm not getting better and yes that includes the hospital doctors I have been kicked out of  hospitals because they no longer want me as a patient.  I'm not rude or anything it's just I never got better some say it's the BPD it makes you go up-and-down, one day I'm fine in the next I feel like I'm going to take hammer to my head.  I tried countless medications none have ever worked and firing me as a patient hasn't been the worst things doctors have done to me because of what some doctors did to me I don't trust anyone.  Not my family not doctors and not even medication no one. At the end of the day if they can't make you a success story they'll just kick you to the curb and say good luck.  I gave up on any type of  counselor or therapist but my mother still thinks that I need help. Yes I do  still wanna kill myself,  Yes I self-harm I cut myself and carve different words into my skin, I do plan on giving my soul to death because I know that death and his friends famine ,war and pestilence are coming. Death talks to me sometimes and told me what I need to do to prepare for his arrival  I know the end is coming so I must prepare. No matter where I go they follow me I can hear them most the time I feel them before I see them. There are 4 different people living in my head each wanting something of their own. I've he police called on me 3 times each time they took me to the hospital against my will. One therapist I thought might actually be different but then I called to schedule another appointment with them and they said that after the initial assessment they will not be accepting me as a patient any longer as I'm too much of a liability.  After that I never wanted to talk face-to-face with another person. Then I thought I might try online counseling not for me but for my mother who is begging me to try something so I signed up with the popular well known online counseling service and they denied me they said I'm too much of a liability for them to help and I needed more help than what they could give me. What do I do when everywhere I turn I get denied? There's a lot more to tell but just talking about this make me wanna stab myself so I'll end it here.",13Dec2019,1
