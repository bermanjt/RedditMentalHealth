0,"I’m from the U.K. and moved to Italy in September for work. It’s a job my aunt got me, working for one of her friends. She told me that I can’t leave early because I’d be letting her friend down. 
3 months later, my depression is so intense, I’m struggling to cope. I have no friends, and only speak to the people I work with. I have never been so lonely. I want to leave so badly and go home, but the anxiety of letting my aunt and my colleagues (who would have to take on my work) down is stopping me from taking action. I just want to be happy and I don’t know what to do. ",19Jan2019,1
1,"I’d like to gather some tools or insight to help my girlfriend... I don’t know what else to do....

Background: I met my wonderful girlfriend a year and a half ago and we have been dating for about a year now. She lives with me.  Let’s call her J.  J comes from a home where she is the first generation to be born and raised as US citizen and her family from a third world country. She is incredibly hardworking and beautiful and also the first college grad of her family. Her upbringing was tough, filled with abuse, poverty, problems you name it. Because of her culture it was basically excepted to be hit for the smallest infraction. When I first met her I had come out of a long term relationship and just wanted a friend. She was the most sincere and kind individual I’d ever met and we had so many laughs and great adventures together.  After 6 months things boiled over and we became a couple. She always kept a crazy schedule saving up for a trip she took and is now back living with me for the past 6 months.  

THE PROBLEM: 
Since she’s been back it’s been one crisis after other some legit and some not.  Money problems I get it. I helped her back on her feet and payed our rent until she she was stable. But her mental health is very poor and has been a roller coaster .  She can be happy singing teaching Zumba then within the same day be freaking out that I’m going to leave her, she’s fat, she needs to move away, someone left a dish in the sink, so and so doesn’t know what it’s like to work. These infractions erupt into manic anger, silent treatment for everyone, childish games. Constantly anxious, angry, manic. She is stunningly beautiful and feels terrible about herself.  Just to make it clear this is not a couples thing. Her closest friends are concerned for her. She’s missed work this week because of “stress”. But life’ from the outside looking in is great. We live in a million dollar home in Honolulu, great friends, eat great food, keep an active lifestyle. BUT I am worried big time. She recently has spoken about self harm and and really dark thoughts, we are both very high Lobito and recently she’ tells me she’s too broken to offer herself to me, feels bad about her body. ( she is stunningly beautiful, Zumba and yoga instructor who does manual labor, total babe who gets attention anywhere she goes ).  I in no way pressure her for anything. I’ve stepped back and really have made an effort to encourage and have healthy habits. I’ve been meal prepping, we’ve both cut alcohol for a month now, training for a road race. I’ve spent countless hours talking through each crisis she is having basically on a daily basis, I’ll massage her when she’s stressed. Yesterday was too much for me ... I broke down on my own after an exhausting morning with her basically losing her mind over not having enough time for her to gather stuff for a girls night we were hosting.  Her girls nights are potluck style and she really had no obligation to provide anything...Her anger is out of control. It seems to be her only way of dealing with things lately. Soo I picked up her slack on this without complaints.... I’ve been encouraging her to go seek professional help but she will not. I don’t want to leave her but this whole ordeal has been a complete drain.  I don’t know what to do honestly. It doesn’t seem like her and it’s been getting worse....

Anyways thanks for reading my long winded rant typed on a mobile. Thanks in advance for any advice. ",19Jan2019,1

3,"Every morning before school, getting up is horrible, like there’s a massive weight on my chest, and then in schools alright, I can’t concentrate and I hate most lessons but other than that it’s bearable.

But then I get home and after a while I just feel low. Not really sad, just, shit. Right now I’m in bed and I just feel shit, I’m thinking about life and everything just seems meh. Things I really enjoyed in the past and things I once was looking forward to seem good ye, better than the present, but not great, just meh. It feels like nothings that great rn, it’s just alright, and Im thinking about my future right now and it feels like I’ll live the rest of my life with everything just being meh, ye good ish but there’s nothing that great there, even tho some things that I once looked forward to seemed great and fun and exciting and now they just seem meh. It just feels like right now I can’t be arsed to go through life with everything just being- meh. I only feel low like this in the morning and in the evening when I’m alone, and I don’t usually think about how “meh” life is when I do feel low, but now that I really have, it’s just a bit shit.

Anyone know why I feel like this? (I know it’s a mental health sub but I haven’t been tested or diagnosed for any mental health problems, but I just thought here’s the best place to post it), i guess I’m kind of wondering if there’s something dodgy with my mental health, but I might just be overthinking and being a pussy. 

Thanks if you read this far :), I’ve posted this once already and people did help out and comment which I appreciate, I just thought I might as well post it again to see if I can get any more opinions overnight.",19Jan2019,1
4,"I just turned 15 and i’m sick and worried about what i’ve been doing wrong to make it so that friends of my exes needed to go to the consolers to assist them, 

the first time happened was when i was in 7th grade and i was with this girl and things were more serious than a regular middle school relationship, it was super toxic because the girl seemed to be struggling with her family a lot and i never did much to try and help since i was struggling with something myself. after a while the consolers had stepped in and discussed with her about unhealthy relationships and i thought it was stupid but i was young and stupid. things were over dramatic because i couldn’t get over it after she broke up with me over text. it still gets to he both of us. a lot of things happened and a lot i can’t even say. i went through a depressive episode during my summer break where i didn’t eat much and i stayed in my room with a lap top and that’s all i would do. 

the events of the first time are similar to the recent thing that happened. it was my 15th birthday and my ex was called to the consoler because her friends was told by her that i made her sad. so they went to the consoler to help her out with me and yet again she was told that i was a unhealthy person to be dating. i know i’m smaller tempered person and i relied on the both of them to much. i also seemed to make them go into calls with me constantly and throughout our days since free time is a thing that a lot of teenagers have so i used it being in a call with them both when i dated them but it seemed to make them sad and trapped but somehow whenever i wasn’t in the calls i went into a depressive state. i’m at a point where no one my age is really a reliable source for help 

i wanna see if anyone that was my age was like this because it’s hard to find someone else who seems as petty or repetitive in anger or sadness. i’m really trying my hardest not to seem like some random emo teen on reddit and i’m know i’m just young and i’m growing up and learning more. but i really need help because last time all i did was say i was different but somehow do the same things, i was told by my first time this happened girlfriend that i was just repetitive and it annoyed her because i was clingy afterwards and i admit that i was annoying and she does too.  i’m starting to think i might grow to be abusive or something or that i should choose to ignore love until i’m a fully grown adult or whatever. this is what i could come up with as a description.(i posted this on the r/getting over it page but i also want to post it here to get more results)",19Jan2019,1
5,"	I’ve been laying in bed since class ended at 2 pm. I ate and ate while I watched TV not because I was hungry. I don’t know why. And then when I started getting all hot and shivery and tired I fell asleep like the sugar knocked me unconscious. I woke up not remembering where I was, but then I remembered the shame and self-loathing and the fat on all those places on my body that would only be worse tomorrow due to my latest slip. So what did I do? Against all logic I ate some more. At this point I felt vomit coming up my throat, but that didn’t stop me. My bed protected me, the blanket covering all my fat, so that no one could see. So that I couldn’t see. So that I didn’t have to feel the weight of it all or the tightness of my clothes that wasn’t there a year prior. Not that I was doing so well a year ago, I was just on the upswing of the pendulum, where I was hardly eating. In trying to heal I was slipping and sliding out of control. There wasn’t/isn’t enough friction in my life to stop me. So I ate some more, and then felt the urge to make it all go away. To avoid the consequences. I looked down at my hand, my right hand with two rings on it that my sister gave me for the holidays. One was on my ring finger, but the other was on my middle finger, so I hesitated. I had promised her I wouldn’t throw up for the rest of winter break, but break was over and I was back at college. The promise was fulfilled, but I triumphed anyway and resisted the urge. Instead of throwing up, I grabbed more food. Then, thoroughly disgusted and scared of the future and of anyone seeing me, that’s when I took my rings off. I went to the bathroom downstairs, not on our hall where people would be. I passed two girls in the hallway and gave a smile and a hello as I walked towards the bathroom where people take their shits in privacy. I went into the big stall that I had previously christened not more than a week and a half prior, and got comfortable. Squatting, hair loosely tied back like I didn’t care if it got a little on it. Hands resting on the toilet like old friends or lovers. Then I made a gun with my hand and shot myself down the throat. Pulling trig. I finally understand why they call it that. I’ve gotten better at it over the last few months. I learned that while you lose a little reactivity, if you go if rapid succession, you can get a four for one or even more. It’s hard to do too many because my tears and the snot dripping out of my nose demand attention. I wipe them with toilet paper that disintegrates all over my hands, as I look down at my vomit stained shirt. Damn, I am going to have to be discrete when I walk back to my room. I try to come up with something real quick. Maybe, I was washing my face, or drinking water and it spilled. My mom always did used to say that I have a hole in my lip. I start tasting acid and decide that enough is enough. I don’t want my voice to be noticeably raspy. I sit there for a second whispering to no one “help me help me help me help me help me.” Last time I did this, I think God was listening because I got an email with a job offer following my interview a few days prior. The good news lifted my spirits for a couple hours. My plea degraded into just one word, “help, help, help” as tears streamed down my face and continue to stream as I write. Help the poor girl, someone. She’s hurting and she’s a liar, but she’s scared and alone, and fat. Not really fat, but fat enough that she misses her abs from her running days, and all her jeans are two sizes too small and she can’t deal with it. She doesn’t know how in the world of college girls getting their only calories from drinks and then going on the stairstepper or the elliptical. She now gets anxiety from exercise especially going to the gym, but she used to be free. She used to be a strong runner. What happened? She used to love it. Help. Help her. Help me. So I go back to my room and hide under my covers and finally call a therapist, but it’s past five and it goes to voicemail and the voice on the voicemail sounds old and sweet like your grandma and you can’t tell your grandma this and she can’t help you so this voice can’t help you but someone needs to help you. You hang up but then you call again and leave the message. Just as you are finishing your friend walks in and starts chatting about her first day at work, but all you can think is I almost slipped up and she heard me. And then she is just sitting there and you have so much inside you, but you can’t say. You may as well be in a fish tank, slowly drowning and gasping, while the outside world can only see the muted, tranquility of the underwater world. She’s sitting right there and she didn’t see. Relief and extreme sorry. Whatever that equivalent for an extreme bitter-sweet. Help. Help me. You don’t whisper, but thoughts aren’t audible. As she comes closer pacing around the room, you minimize the psychologist finder website open on your browser. She leaves and you want to tell you mom, but she’s dealing with other crisis and she doesn’t know how to help. It would only scare her, distract her from your sick grandmother, and she would pull you away from school to come back home. So you think of your sister. She already knows, but she is younger than you and has her own issues and isn’t strong enough to carry me and my damage. Literally, she can’t even pick me up, the voice thinks like a fat joke that isn’t a joke. I shouldn’t have ever told her at all. It is too much, but I was so desperate and sad I had no choice, but to shove on her my burden. Then my roommate walks in and sees the tear streaks down my face and asks what’s wrong and I burst into tears. I don’t talk, but I’ve been found out. Help.",19Jan2019,1
6," As long as I can remember myself, I had the best memory that it comes. I could have remembered anything perfectly that happened in at least half a year span, could have recalled up to smallest details. Up until I started working as IT specialist for one and a half years, not realizing I had forgotten numbers that was mentioned, prices that clients should have paid, passwords of clients computers, I had to check everything that was checked in the system even thought I was the one that accepted orders from the clients, being the one that has written information in the company systems and have heard everything being mentioned, that has driven me crazy from the first time that I have forgotten something so obvious, even though I have driven myself to work as the best as there could be, remembering everything that I saw or heard at least once, as the time passed I had to check system configuration that we done and smallest of fixes that had to be done to the computers. That drove me crazy, not even that, but since I started working, my sleeping schedule has changed drastically. From feeling fully rested after 5-7 hours of sleep, because I couldn’t even sleep more, I felt fully rested after that and wanting to just jump out to bed after waking up, to not even being rested after 8 hours of sleep or more. My life shifted 180 degrees and since then I’m still wondering what really happened to me. I can’t trust my memory anymore, I can’t even trust myself to wake up early after working for at least 6 hours at random things. I have tried resting for whole day, but that didn’t change a damn thing, I lost my job to a mistake, the job that I did countless times before, I have failed, my colleges started asking if I have a girlfriend or something and not getting enough of sleep. I didn’t, I slept for 8-9 straight waking up feeling tired, sometimes spending an hour after waking up in the bed surfing on the internet on my phone, because I didn’t want to get up. From one of the best there could be I started to feel useless, failing even simple tasks that I have done countless times. Even myself I didn’t known what has happened, as long as I remember myself, I was on top of everyone, getting stuff done quicker and better than everyone else. 

As of now I can’t focus on single task, I started working on my own project, but I feel like I can’t do it, even though I have knowledge and skills for it. I’m jobless, can’t find any job, working on my own project hoping I can make business from it, but feeling tired all day after sleeping for at least 9 hours, because I can’t just wake up earlier, if I try to wake up earlier, I just fall back to sleep after turning off my alarm. I am feeling tired of all the bullshit and I have started spending my time on YouTube watching random videos, first for just half an hour to now for at least 3-7 hours daily. I need serious help because I don’t even know that is happening with me, I can’t tell if it is normal and I’m just getting old, but I refuse to believe that, or something seriously have changed me. I really don’t know what to do anymore, because if I continue what I’m doing now, I will feel even more useless. I seriously can’t think straight anymore and I have just started drinking to feel like something. As of now I’m feeling pretty drunk as I’m writing this knowing that this isn’t going to solve anything.  
 

I ‘m seriously feeling ashamed of myself as of now and because of that I want to keep my identity as human being and internet persona secret. I’m posting this as random user of the internet, even though majority of my time is being spend on the internet.",19Jan2019,1

9,"I can go from feeling completely fine with energy and some sleep issues, no self harm and no suicidal thoughts to suddenly feeling depressed with suicidal thoughts and self harm.

This can last anywhere from a few hours to a few days, maybe a week at the most. Once I'm on the depression side of things that can last for a few days all the way to months.

Been told by two different professionals I don't have bipolar, likely because I was stable on the meds (even if it was the depressed side) for over a year now. Coming off the meds currently and that's fun.

It strikes me as maybe rapid cycling bipolar with hypomania. It certainly could be BPD but I don't have problems with my emotions swinging around.... just ""normal"" and ""depressed"" moods.

Unfortunately during this time period she has said she wanted to end her life. More specifically, with a kitchen knife across her throat

I was on the phone with her when this happened, several times in fact

Fast forward to today, one scene in glass involves a main character slitting the throat of someone

While I don’t really care about the murder in the movie, the suffering of the victim hit me like a truck

The gasping for air and everything made me sick

And then I imagined that was what my girlfriend would’ve gone through. Just a minute of torture, choking on her own blood. It was too much

I walked out of the theatre barely holding in tears

While better now I’m still wondering how I can manage this and possibly help prevent another episode like this from occurring

15,"Disclaimer: I'm already seeing a therapist and psychiatrist, and trying new meds, and do not currently have plans to hurt myself. 

Basically I need to find a job. I haven't had a real job in over 3 years going on 4 now, where I stopped going to work due to depression and haven't worked a real job since. I've done self-employed work on places like mturk and crowdsurf support, but the pay is awful and I can't even do that anymore. 

I'm not sure what to do at this point. My therapist encourages me to spend an hour each day to work on a resume, look at job listings, or find a temp agency but I can't and it's terrifying. I have awful anxiety too, especially around people and crowds, and over the phone too. I thought assisted suicide could be an option, but it seems like it's only for people who are terminally ill with less than 6 months to live(California). 

What are even my options, really? Just  continue living until my credit card is maxed out, maybe hope I can get myself to work on these low paying online options again with new meds? My own mind just tells me I need to die, I've started a new medication for those thoughts (Ativan) and it helps, but puts me straight to sleep. ",19Jan2019,1

I’m currently on the train on my way to my dance class in the city which is a 50 min train ride and I’m so scared I’ll get sick on the train or in the city and I don’t have anyone with me. I had a breakdown on the train platform before I got on train coz my stomach feels weird...

21,"I don't even know if this is how this mental health stuff works. I went to a therapist for the first time the other day. It was alright but I'm going to search for new ones because she held very obvious religious opinions (I'm agnostic). 

I have had many simple problems and I just want to know what I should be looking for when going to be diagnosed (possibly). Some traits:

• Age regression (not so problematic unless I feel upset in a 'grumpy toddler' way)

•Relationship paranoia, no matter how perfect my boyfriend treats me.

•this weird paranoia where I cry if it's too dark and I imagine too many things. It used to happen way more often to the point where I was convinced that a water bottle wanted to kill me.

•Sometimes I just get upset for weird reasons. Kinda in a sensory overload kinda way. 

•I get explosive when it comes to family. I'll be fine for the first day and then the next, I'm throwing things. 

•I don't trust older men. I've never been sexually assaulted or molested but I have been sexualized by older men. (I'm literally 16, ew) For some reason, that's normal around here? It's disgusting.

•family issues galore but I'm still awfully lucky. I still have a decent situation nowadays. I just don't live with parents.

I know this is probably not going to help and all and this isn't even everything. I'm probably fine but I want to go searching for answers. Any advice?",19Jan2019,1
22,"So I’ve been in a relationship for almost 6 months now and I absolutely love my boyfriend. Most days he makes me unbelievably happy and of course, because of my dependency, I’ve grown incredibly attached to him.
However, here is where issue has arisen. I have very very severe anxiety, paranoia, and worsening depression. He also suffers from depression and PTSD. I feel like our disorders clash with each other, his hurting me more than mine hurts him. Whenever he’s going through a bought of depression, it puts me in one of the worst mental places I think I’ve ever experienced, and my suicidal thoughts have grown more since we’ve started dating.
Along with my anxiety, I also have very bad separation issues, and he tends to go away for hours on end with no word. This scares the everliving shit out of me and I don’t know how to tell him “text me more” without sounding like a possessive lunatic. 
I don’t want to admit to myself that he’s triggering my disorders because I truly love him. He’s the only person who has made me feel safe to have the disorders I have and hasn’t triggered my paranoia, which everyone else I’ve met does. I just can’t bear to break up with him, but I’m scared my metal health will only continue to decline.

23,"*Hi all...this is a big one, and it's gonna require a ton of context so that I can get out the current state of my life, so please bear with me. I might get a bit ramble-y or pedantic and it might seem like I'm making weird connections at some point, but there's probably a reason for everything. It's probably going to sound like I'm spewing my entire life story, but it's only because I'm just trying to figure out what's actually relevant and what isn't, and to provide backstory for why I think I am the way I am. Hopefully this isn't too much overload of information, but I'm not trying to solve a specific life issue, I'm trying to solve \*me\*, which I hope isn't something that can be boiled down to a few sentences.

I think I would appreciate some mental health help/advice. I haven't gone to see a psychiatrist/therapist/psychologist yet for the same reason I avoid going to the doctor. **I'm not in danger, I'm not dieing, I'm not suicidal or in danger of hurting myself or anyone else.** I'd just personally rather avoid taking up a professional's working time if I'm not at a point where I literally can't solve my own problems myself anymore, or in an amount of time that's reasonable (I know that's vague, but it's hard to get out what ""reasonable"" actually means in a normal sentence, I just have a sense of when it makes sense for me to go see someone). I'm pretty close to feeling like it would help a lot to go see someone now, but that's why I'm posting here first, so I can talk to people who are volunteering on their own time to do this, rather than someone who has appointments with x number of people who \*are\* in danger and genuinely struggling. I also don't want to go in somewhere and have someone prescribe me anti-depressants that I have to become dependent on to function. I understand their purpose and how they're supposed to help you solve your own issues, but I don't have any legitimate personal real-world issues, I just have my thoughts. My actual daily life is probably pretty decent from an external point of view, and part of my constantly just wants to say that I'm being a baby and should stop dwelling or overthinking.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently 26 (male in Canada) and if I had to boil down my problems, I'm pretty sure I've had some kind of depression or anxiety for a very long time. I have no idea if it's anything severe, I never really noticed it having a huge affect on me other than being lonely, being lazy, and beating myself up, which was never really much of a problem for me until recently. In high school and college I was basically a complete loner aside from both sides of my family and 2 friends (1 in college), and the people I'd make small-talk with or joke around with during class. I went into class, paid attention, and then either went home or to the library at lunch and read or played video games.

In high school I did decently well overall aside from some classes I really wasn't interested (I still passed, just barely), and got some scholar award for taking some higher level classes in the stuff I was interested in. I really took off with programming classes though and tore through all my work long before it was due, and had tons of time to mess around and experiment. It was fun to be creative in this way, and I knew long before the end of high school that I definitely was going to be kicked out and had to go to college, so I went into that.

College was about the same, I went to class, paid attention to the interesting stuff, tried to pay attention and make the effort to learn for the stuff I didn't care as much about, but at this point, I think depression was starting to take more of a hold on me, because I didn't really care overall. I was there 100% purely to get a slip of paper that said I knew what I was talking about so I could get a job, anything else was basically pointless to me. I failed a class twice due to low effort on my part, and because of that my schedule screwed up and I had to shift classes and split my 4th year into a 4th and 5th year. It was dumb, but somehow I still graduated with a reasonable GPA.

During college, we had to do a ""co-op"" program. Which, if you're not aware, is like a paid internship for school. You do some job in your field, they hand-hold you a bit, and you report back to the school on what you learned, how you approached problems, and then you got to see what everyone's experiences were like at the end of the semester. **Anyways,** I got picked up by a weird little company that has a really boring product, but incredible spirit for freedom and nurturing employees. In the interview, they were happy with the fact that I compensated for not knowing about important technologies by building my own version that satisfied my needs. In the interview they were offering to hand me a project of my own to do as I saw fit. They were also the only company that took me up for a co-op interview, so I agreed immediately. Now I know it was almost definitely because they just wanted cheap labour for some tools they wanted, but at the time it was a dream for me, I had someone interested in me and trusting me to do something big.

&amp;#x200B;

It's here that I started to gain some confidence. I was very aware that I was different from everyone around me. I was shy, quiet, reserved overall, until I was needed to do something, and then I had no problem going over to ask a question or introduce myself, aside from just generally having a hard time getting out what I wanted to say. I used to trip over my words, speak very fast, and bury myself in work during meetings so that I didn't have to look up or at anyone (I would just listen until I got the sense that everyone was working with bad information, and then try to correct it). I never felt like I was making a real impact on the company, but I kept getting put into special projects and I could tell that they were interested in me in some way. The only thing I could never figure out is if they were treating me like that because they thought I was good at what I did, or because I wasn't good at my actual job and they needed to move me around to see what else I'd be good at. I dunno, I didn't think about it a ton, I was just happy to have a job in my field, and to have actual spending money. My salary was low for my field for a very long time, and I think that really negatively affected my self-esteem, but I could see myself constantly providing value, and I never gave up on trying to make an impact.

Over time, I've gotten more outgoing, got a couple extra friends, but also became more pessimistic overall. I talk more, but I find I'm always talking about problems and ways we can go about solving problems, but also how we all constantly have so much busy work to do that we can't deal with the ""real"" problems which cause the busy work. I also felt like I was some crazy doom-sayer who saw problems in everything that noone else was noticing or mentioning. It came to a boiling point a few months ago and I just about quit. I did my research, I talked to all of my team, I went and talked to recruiters and figured out what I could be valued at and got a much larger number. I'd gotten used to being okay with what I was making, but I needed more to really be able to provide for my family \*and\* myself. I was getting tired of not knowing if I was valued or not, and was tired of not knowing how to get myself into a situation where I could actually make progress towards solving these bigger problems instead of small stuff. I didn't want to let the small work slide and make it look like I was ignoring my duties, but I absolutely had to put work into getting us out of the pit we were in, so I worked after-hours or on weekends to both show that I was dedicated, capable, and future-focused. It doesn't help that we've either had bad managers, or no managers, so it's hard to get noticed without taking the initiative yourself.

Anyways, things got worse, I got angry, an amount of anger that was scary to me because I was starting to scream at my pillow and punch heavy cushions. I've always been pretty emotionally reserved, so to suddenly feel like I had no other option to vent made me VERY worried about myself. I'd noticed that I was also starting to get angry at others, or that I was starting to dismiss them, or tell them how to do their work better. I still think they were legitimate good points, but definitely not presented in a way that they'd be receptive to, and likely they were things that don't really matter in the grand scheme of things. Every time I lashed out, I immediately beat myself up for it because I immediately knew it was the wrong thing to do, but it's like I couldn't help it and \*HAD\* to take some kind of action. It was like I was just constantly detecting patterns of thought in other people that were leading to problems, and then essentially getting angry at them for not being different. I'm reserved overall, so it never really deeply hurt anyone, I never insulted anyone or physically lashed out, but I was starting to get extremely frustrated. I'm not proud of how I thought.

Then very suddenly, like over two months, things started working out. The company recognized that we were having such huge issues and put everything on hold to start a massive organizational rework project. My manager at the time recognized that I wasn't being paid enough and asked me what I was looking for. I gave him my research and amount, and he agreed to bring it to HR. It seemed like a complete 180.

Normally this manager and I didn't get along. I was constantly upset with his style of management that just put more work on us without getting any input, and with his constant habit of telling us about industry standards and how some technology is ""what everyone uses"", and getting everyone focused on reading up on it, and then like, 2 weeks later changing his mind and picking something else. We stopped talking for the most part while he focused on this rework project, and only talked to me when he needed something done. To see him suddenly apologize for his behavior, leave the company, and agree to pay me more was kind of a shock.

I finally had some confirmation that I wasn't an idiot or was being pitied or something, I wasn't just complaining uselessly and being afraid of the future, and that I wasn't just being underpaid because they thought they could get away with it, so I took a step back. I got my raise and some advice from my director, went on vacation this past Christmas/New Years, had some time to think and reset. A little before then, I started mindfulness. I started with meditation, but I didn't go all the way with it because I was already starting to take notice of my thoughts to a point where it was helping me. Having this little bit of time let me just take a sec and think about my life objectively, and I could take a breath and finally relax a bit after years of what felt like a blind panic.

I understood that this wasn't normal thinking, and that my beating myself up all the time and thinking I was dumb and not worth it was probably the cause of just about all of my life problems, so I started thinking about what could fix that and what caused that, and naturally went to my childhood. For much of my life, I've been worried about falling back on what felt like a stereotype. The standard ""my childhood sucked and I didn't get a perfect life so now I'm depressed, pills plz"" felt like such a hurtful cliche to me, like it was a convenient way to put all your problems on someone else and continue with your life while ignoring your actual character flaws. I don't think like that anymore, but I'm aware that some people very likely \*do\* actually act like that, so I've been trying to avoid being those people and learn how to pick out what's actually damaging from my childhood, and what's just me being upset that my life isn't perfect.

&amp;#x200B;

I definitely wasn't always like this, and the more I think about it, the more I realize that my later childhood might have actually had a huge impact on my depression, but I've just never really given myself a chance to think about it until now. As a kid, I was very playful and outgoing. I used to always get in trouble for talking in class, had unending curiosity about the world, and overall was having a very good time. I played outside with friends and had them over to play video games with me when it was allowed. I had good grades overall and I think my teachers were trying to convince my parents that I should be in some genius program or something. To this day, my parents both still tell me that they think I'm crazy smart, but I can't help but shrug it off. They're parents, parents say nice things, everyone's mom tells them they're handsome. I probably am very good at learning and conveying, but I have very obvious personal flaws that prevent me from feeling capable and ""normal"".

If I had to point to a specific point as a possible cause for my change, it would probably be when my parents split up. I was 10, and very suddenly had to leave all my friends, move with my mother to another, smaller city, in a geared-to-income neighborhood, and constantly have my Dad on my mind, and wanting to visit him as much as possible. He wasn't bad or anything, they just didn't get along anymore and we weren't in a good place financially, so they both moved away from each other. I think he was living out of his car for a while, but got back on his feet and starting seeing other people. He found someone stable, moved in with her, and lived his life.

During this time, I was with my mom and my sister, and was slowly watching my mom lose herself to the pressures of life. My early childhood feels like a dream. My Dad worked his ass off, doing all kinds of work he probably didn't like to, while my Mom stayed home, cooked and raised kids, and was the stereotypical religious housewife. We went to church, I wasn't allowed to read/watch Harry Potter or anything ""satanic"", and she got all the kids and families together for like, play-dates, events, and Tupperware parties. When they split up, everyone got more ""real"". 

Over a couple years. She turned into a completely different person, suddenly very open and accepting, loving and personable, very spiritual, completely against organized religion. She got together with someone else, who I didn't realize until later in my life, was a very terrible, manipulative person. I definitely wasn't having a good time anymore. They fought a lot, I either hid in my room while I was allowed in the house, or got forced outside for hours at a time because they didn't want me in the house (likely so they could smoke and talk about ""adult"" things with each other and friends). I started to need to leave, and so I somehow got them to agree to let me move in with my Dad (that part of my life is a little fuzzy, I just know I was asked and I said yes).

He's generally a great guy, but has the tendency to get angry sometimes. He obviously cared a ton about his kids, and seemed to have an unending supply of ability to suffer through menial work to provide for his family. If there was anyone I learned my ""just suck it up and get through it"" and ""you have to work hard for what you want"" behavior, it's from him, while I probably got my general ""unsure about everything, but open to anything"" outlook from my mom. My Dad made sure I did well in school, made sure I knew I needed to work, and kicked me out when I graduated college (not aggressively, I just didn't have the choice to stay and think about what I really wanted to do or laze around and enjoy life for a sec). All of this was great and obviously the right things to do because those are all important life lessons I probably wouldn't have pushed for myself. I left his house with the sole goal of ""make money, help your Mom and sisters"". This is like 10 years after moving in with him, and over that time, my Mom and sisters were getting steadily worse.

I visited her when I could, but it was always depressing. She was really struggling, and I was trying to help the best I could, but I was just a kid, and couldn't really do a whole lot except make sure the place was tidy, and that my sisters were focused on growing and getting out of there. It really pained me because I knew she wasn't malicious, she was just naive or something. I don't know. It's hard to really figure out now, but she's definitely not a smart person, and sometimes I even doubt that she's really as open and loving as she seems, but I care about her, and since she split with the manipulative shithead, she's sort of been growing, but she's 40-something now and I'm not expecting that she'll suddenly become an incredible person at this point in her life. She's content to finish raising her last kid, smoke pot, and try to find something in cooking she can do on her own (she's trying to start a business).

I had a ton of resentment for her, but very conflicted resentment. I absolutely hated her, both for falling for the shithead, and then continuing to let him manipulate her with their child, and bringing her whole side of the family down for years and years. I had so many thoughts of beating him to death and rescuing my sisters from their damaging life, but that wasn't a solution. I could see my sister grow my quiet and closed off, and my other sister start getting an interest in drugs and general bad behavior. I felt powerless from my Dad's, and tried to ignore it and focus on school and my bad social life, and then focused on my Mom and sisters when I was visiting them (and then later through chatting and texting when they were older). My mom was clearly starting to lose it, had to start taking some kind of anti-depressant or anti-psychotic or something. I think she had a mental break somewhere, but I wasn't present for it. She constantly makes spiritual excuses for her life, and leaves everything up to ""the universe"", and I couldn't help but blame that outlook for her shitty life. I just kept getting angrier and angrier at her internally for not smartening up and taking control of her life, but I was so afraid to say anything because she was already so emotionally fragile. It was torture, I want to cry just writing about how I felt now.

At my Dad's though, things weren't perfect either. He cared, and was a pretty smart guy, but he sided on the abuse side of things rather than helping when I wasn't turning out the way he wanted. I got called stupid for getting low grades a lot, I had a lot of very stern talks that made me feel small. It smartened me up sometimes, but that driving ""be better"" voice in my head was always him, and I was glad to get away for a while at college, so I could have some semblance of a normal life. When he split up with my step-mom and went out up north on his own for like 4 years, I was secretly glad but also sad for not getting to see him as easily. We talked, but barely. I did college and tried to focus on helping my Mom like I was supposed to, and he lived his life and figured himself out.

Eventually, my Mom did smarten the fuck up and fully completely got rid of him aside from 1 or 2 relapses that I made very clear was a bad idea. At this point I was past caring about her mental state, I'd already seen my two sisters turn into completely different people, so the damage was done and I couldn't bring myself to worry about her anymore. Over time we've gotten closer, but I think the only thing that let that happen was that I had to stop thinking about her as a capable parent and my mom. It feels bad to say it and I don't think I've finalized that until now, but we're just friends I think. I get along with her, but I can see myself taking a parent role with my sisters, and I think she expects that from me now. They're already old enough and have started moving out, but the one remaining with her is the daughter of the shithole, and she's very screwed up now. She cuts herself occasionally, she's extremely afraid of people, she lashes out at people for the simplest things or assumes everyone around her is stupid for not understanding what she wants and then immediately goes back to beating herself up for ""being stupid"". I can see her father's influence and her attempts to manipulate my Mom. She's going to therapy, but she's not really growing and my Mom doesn't know how to help her without just kicking her out of the house and making her fend for herself. At this rate, they're just driving each other insane.

&amp;#x200B;

So now after all that, we come back to now. I finally have money, a fair amount of it, enough to make everyone's lives easier and make sure nothing bad happens anymore and that everyone can pay for rent and legal fees, and for the first time in like 16 years, I'm confronting the fact that I might not have gotten out unscathed in all this, that I might actually be extremely capable after-all, and that if I don't take care of myself, I'm just going to end up hurting everyone around me in an effort to do my own thing or something. I feel like I don't know how to be normal, how to have a conversation with the people around me and actually like it, and how to either find what I really like in life to talk about, or to find friends that are also interested in talking about huge life things rather than like, sports or some game or something. I've got a passing interest in those things, and I'll play video games with anyone any day of my life, but there's gotta be something more. I'm finally at a point where I can go look for that something more, and I'm realizing that I'm VASTLY under-prepared to just be a normal human learning and loving and doing life.

I did a bit of personality research, and psychology research, and paired that with meditation and a bit of smoking pot to help expand my mind a bit, and it helped me become happier and more trusting of people, but I'm still running into those same problems I had before things started getting better. I don't know what I like. I don't know how to talk to people, I don't know how to be a good, normal person that people enjoy interacting with. Every interaction I have either ends up with me feeling bad for being aggressive without taking into account everyone's thoughts and opinions, or like I was too timid and didn't say something that I felt needed to be said, even if it's a minor thing.

I'm constantly thinking of the future, and just about every single action I take has like, an immediate goal, with a bit of a flair towards the future. Like I'll do a project, but build in redundancies, extensive reporting, and modularity because I'm sure it will be expanded later, and it pretty much always is. I do this same thing in conversations with people and just my outlook on life. I try to keep everyone focused on long-term goals and how we can reach them while also fulfilling short term goals, and this doesn't always work well with people. I'm running into problems a lot where I'm trying to tell someone something or do something in a specific way that could get them to understand things better and prevent a possible problem in the future, but then I get others jumping in and making a mess of my delicate act (which I'm not even sure will even do what I'm wanting it to), and then have to come up with a way on the spot to explain what I was doing (which is hard because it's very complex sometimes), in a way that both doesn't make me come off as a know-it-all, while also trying to avoid hurting their feelings, while \*ALSO\* trying to be open to the fact that I could be wrong. It's exhausting, and I don't even bother sometimes. I'm also running into problems constantly where someone will say something, I'll try to respond, then I'll get interrupted or talked over (which seems to be common in meetings, either because of necessity or because you can't hear someone), and then by the time everyone stops talking and it's polite to get a word in, the original topic is LONG over and I'd just feel out of place for bringing up my original point.

&amp;#x200B;

 I'm feeling the same kind of anger coming up and so I decided to ask for help here. I'm frustrated, I don't know how to deal with people. I know there are tons of smarter people than me and that I'm no Albert Einstein or Bill Gates, but damn. I feel like I just take in the consideration of SO MUCH MORE than most of the people I work with that it's constantly making me wonder if I'm just trying too hard and should just stop trying to make things better overall, or if I really am actually a genius like people seem to tell me and should really push for the things I believe in. I just don't know how to deal with people in general, and constantly coming back to this wall of social problems is hampering my ability to grow. I want to be normal, I don't want to be this controlling asshole, I want people to like me without having to compromise what I like. I just want to be me, but I have no idea what me is.

At this point, I don't even know if I'm doing what I want to do, I just know that me working is a tool to grow, and I still need to have a bit of a financial buffer so that when I do figure out what I want to do, I have some money to live off of and provide for others while I do my own thing. In the meantime, I can get better with dealing with all kinds of people, prove to myself and others that I can provide benefits, that I have genuine value over another hire at the same price, and that I'm not going to live the rest of my life in the same 9-5 job. I'm trying to spend my free time learning and doing things I like, but I feel like some husk who's sole purpose in life is to work and give myself to others. I want to be me again, but the only thing I can think of as me is some loner who plays video games when he's not at work. I've been reading more recently about how to talk about people and what to do in certain, but nothing is clicking as of yet. Either that, or it's clicking very well and I'm just worrying too much. I see the things I want come into fruition slowly, but it never seems like anyone is happy about it, or that they're only acting on my suggestions because they're afraid I'll be upset if they don't humour me or something like that.

&amp;#x200B;

It's **maddening**, and I want to curl up in a ball and cry sometimes, but I keep plodding along, remain strong and objective, and spend my free time finding myself when I'm not stressed out, but I don't know what to do, and I'm afraid I'll never figure it out with my current outlook. I'm hoping someone can help. If this is too long and I don't get any responses, I'll just cave in and go talk to a therapist.",19Jan2019,1

28,"So, I’ve had this condition ever since I can remember. I couldn’t place my finger on exactly when it started but all I knew is that it’s always been there. I’m not sure if what I have is maladaptive daydreaming because most of the article I’ve perused through describes MD as something a little different from my experience (even though the rest of the descriptions were spot on). I know what I’m about to share is weird but I was really hoping to find some people who can relate to this. Usually when I’m dreaming, I listen to music and pace around the room when I’m alone or I might even run from wall to wall while doing weird hand gestures with weird facial expressions if I’m really immersed in my dreaming (people will think I’m crazy if they see me doing this). Every-time I do this, one of the common scenarios I’ll imagine myself is of me having some sort of magical power combating enemies with my friends (I’m fully aware of how infantile this sounds) or performing for a crowd while the people I know fawn over me. The articles I went through describes how people with MD create characters and stuff instead of basing them on real life. So my point, or rather question here is, is this still considered as maladaptive dreaming? And can anyone else with this condition relate to my story? Would love to hear your thoughts! ",19Jan2019,1

When I got my backpack I found one of them (A), the one who was asked to tag along with the money guy, I'll call him A and the money one B, so he said that we wanted his backpack, idk why did they got away from each other.
A called B and then he wanted to go to the bathroom, so I went with him and was going to wait outside, but he took some time, so I stood up and waited on some stairs that allowed me to see if someone came out, after not seeing him my dumb brain asumed that he just did this to have me waiting there and gi away, so I went for my icecream.

I bought my icecream, and after that I called B, he didn't answered, so somewhy I asumed that they did all of this just to get rid of me, I know It's silly, but at the time it felt logical. 
After being unable to contact any of them I decided to just go home, but then my phone rang, when I picked it up I heard B's voice asking me where I was, then he asked me to come with them and told me where they were. So there's where I realised that maybe I was just stupid for doing all of this.

At the end A just took too long in the bathroom and B just wanted a hotdog, everything came together, I was the one acting weird. I did have a nice time after this, but it made me realize that maybe there is indeed something wrong with me.

I'll mention other things that I've noticed about myself:
Today I was very clingy with some classmates, felt really numb minded, and was somewhy kinda moody.
Recently I've been sleeping more than usual.
I think that I'm getting progresively dumber.
I've also been getting super lazy over the past 4 months.

I'll also like to mention that this friendshil with A and B started like 6 months ago and it came from a mutual friend that was really mean and she was the one who encouraged them to do the backpack stuff, I also had issues like this one with our old friend group.

30,"First of all, I'm not going to your typical counseling. It's a counseling program where interns and new therapists go to get their start on their careers. And my therapist shares everything with another: the head therapist of the place. So that's cool, but because I'm seeing two different therapists, I can see the other therapist working more.(one therapist is solo, the other one is a marriage counseling with my fiancée) and we're both improving a lot with very little therapy. She is, I'm not. 

So, I'm just wondering: what do you guys do during therapy sessions? What do you talk about? What happens?

I don't know. I see my therapist every week, and we just talk about the week and what happened, and usually I'm the one talking just rambling on about my week. And I'm not sure if it's working. I still get angry very easily, still get annoyed, etc. But I don't really talk to my therapist about it so of course it doesn't work but.. 

I don't know. Obviously therapy helps but I don't see it. And I think it has to do with me and what I'm talking about in therapy. 

This little kid and his mom always have a plan for what they're talking about in therapy. Like""today I want to talk about frustration and forgiveness. "" But I don't have anything like that. I just talk about my week.

31,"Hi, I'm 20 years old and my biggest problem is unability to deal with new tasks. To begin with I attended psychotherapy for 2 years but nothing really changed when it comes to my unability however I got to know some new things about me. However it wasn't the only reason why I was attending psychotherapy - I also have depression, social anxiety and OCD. Since it didn't really helped that much I decided to take part in group psychotheraphy. Tomorrow it's actually going to be our fifth meeting, on the last one I got some courage to talk about my past because on the individual theraphy it wasn't that tough and I was able to present my view why I think I'm struggling with all those diseases. The main reason I think is my overprotective mother. When I was a kid I couldn't leave my neighbourdhood and my mom did everything for me, I didn't have any responsibilities. I didn't need to think because my mother was doing it for me. I couldn't even tie my shoes for a long time or make the bed. Still, to this day I can't do some of the things. I didn't knew back then it was wrong for me and if I knew what the outcome would be... Now I ended up with all those diseases, I'm unresourceful and have low-self esteem. The worst part is dealing with new things and the reason why I don't see any purpose in my life. Each time I'm confronted with something new I must ask someone for advice or depend on other person because if I have to confront something alone I ran away or just stand there like an idiot and don't know what to do until someone guide me and take the first step. I must practice everything because I can't think independently on new problems, situations. I always remember of the origami lessons that I had in school, when I was looking around the class everyone was trying to do something while I was just looking at those papers and didn't know what to do with them. I can't make the first step without someone helping me.  I feel like I need to have someone operating my hands. I feel like an useless idiot. When I was younger everyone expected that I'm gonna be great at everything because I was good at all subjects but this potential is no more there. Even, when I joined school first I already had this problem with new tasks, I wasn't just aware of it. I can't go to work because of it because I know how it will all end.. with mockery. I had apprentice ships 2 times because of the school that I attended and I was in hotel already... it was all the same... I even heard from one of the female workers out there ""I bet your mom does everything for you in home"". Of course I said ""no"" but it was the truth. I also failed my exams to attend university so basically I'm sitting at home waiting till I can write those exams once again. I think I lost hope that anything is going to be better long time ago. My day is full of listening to music and fantasizing, I don't even want to sleep, just keep fantasizing. Suicide? I don't have enough courage. I'm basically seeking an answer for what's wrong with me for four years. At first I thought it's maybe avoidant personality disorder but I think it might be dependent personality disorder now or maybe I am just stupid. I don't know. Anyway, it must be a rare disease since I haven't meet anyone like me. I just wanted to get something off my chest.",19Jan2019,1
32,"I dont know if this is more of an anxiety attack thing or panic attack (if theres even a difference, I dont know) but it's been happening since late November at relatively random times. It starts with my heart rate increasing or a dull pain starting in my left hips that spreads down my leg and up my back and neck. My heart feels like its pounding out of my chest and my brain feels like it's on fire. The pain in my hip, leg and back gets pretty intense and sometimes my gut will feel upset. My joints and muscles get sore like I ran a marathon and exercised for hours. Aside from my most recent instance it leads to my muscles locking up and not being able to breath. When this happens I cant do anything but cry and shake. My most recent attack was different because at its peak I was stuck in counting and stacking coins perfectly and in the same way and repeating numbers in no specific order. Once that broke I was bent on pacing and had a severe stutter that has stayed with me very slightly.

37,"       Hey, I'm a 16-year-old male named Miles. I have a few questions about certain actions that I do.
1. I like to toy with people's emotions. I'm VERY good at lying (I tell the truth just as much as I lie)
2. I like to study the body language of humans, mostly through the internet. I use the information I gather and test it on people in real-world situations.
3. I dislike most people and find them annoying/repulsive. Yet I still find that peoples minds and the way they work are fascinating.
4. I enjoy making social situations and interactions as awkward as possible as a means of seeing how people react, not vocally, but through body language. This is not the case all the time only when I'm in the mood. I have very keen senses when it comes to reading body language. I use this acquired skill in an effort to seek out weakness and anxiety. I either ""sympathize"" with them to become ""friends"" for later uses or I do what is mentioned below
5. I find it very amusing to assert my dominance over others not through violence but through intense unwavering eye contact and other body language. It's like staring into a dog's eyes and waiting until the dog looks away but you keep looking, like a primal instinct of dominance as I wait and watch them submit and accept the fact that they are lesser than I and that I'm the leader of the pack, that I am the Alpha. (Also It's not like I'm bullying people because they are weak because I don't go for weak plebs I do this to the ones at the top of the social hierarchy.
6. Generally, I am ""nice"" during conversations but I tend to use the rule ""keep your ""friends"" close and your enemies closer"". I say that because I like to become ""friends"" with people I hate until I become close enough to get some dirt (personal secrets) and then use that dirt against them later.
7. I also tend to befriend people for the purpose of using them
I know that there is (or should) be
something wrong with that but I beg to differ, in fact, I find it quite entertaining. Something weird I've noticed is that (sometimes) people that I haven't even met before think I'm creepy yet I've maybe seen them once and have never spoken with them before, which is odd because everyone usually likes me from the start. I think my actions might be slightly different from other peoples. I should feel bad, but I don't. Could there be something wrong with me, if so what?

38,"I don’t feel like I love anyone in my life, including my family and my girlfriend.

I’m not saying I’m a sadist who likes hurting other people; quite the opposite, actually. My problem is that everyone, including “loved ones”, feel like nothing more than acquaintances to me.

Getting myself to say  “I love you” feels like nothing more than saying “Hello,” in the sense that there is no emotion behind it. Any time I do try to show affection, doing things like hugging or kissing, I feel like I’m only doing because I feel like I have to. This causes me to feel like I’m trapped in my relationship with my girlfriend because I don’t want to break up with her and break her heart, but I don’t have any special feelings for her, and I’m scared that I always act too cold towards her without even realizing it.

I haven’t been medically diagnosed with depression or any other mental issues, mainly since I haven’t seen any therapist for more than one session, so I can’t say if it has anything to do with depression.

39,"Today, I came to the conclusion that I'm at my breaking point and am overworked with everything and decided that my suicidal thoughts were going to come through today. I'm heartbroken and in shock with news I had received yesterday, that my mother is pregnant. I'm 17 and I have one 12 year old sibling, so you can expect my mother is older. Less than a month ago, my mother and I jokingly discussed pregnancy and I confessed that with my mental health on the decline, I would very well go through with suicide if she became pregnant ever again. Yesterday she had revealed to me she is expecting with her new boyfriend and I was in denial. Until I experienced the ecstasied moment similar to then you realize you're high, I was convinced she was shitting with me. I excused myself from the living room to my bedroom where I threw up on my floor. It wasn't the fact that she's pregnant that got me. It was the pain she had brought me recently with a new boyfriend she only just striated seeing. It was the hurt she had brought me over the last year and a half since leaving my stepfather. It was the carelessness she's expressed to my younger brother and I, depending on me to mother my sibling for over a year. She's not mature enough for another child. I'm almost an adult and when she pumps this new child out, I'm never going to be given a break. I don't want children. My mother's behavior towards my brother and I has decided that. If I leave once an adult, I will be shamed by all of my family members. I can't do it. I've had major behavior health problems since I was 9 years old and had to be admitted to a mental health facility. They've never improved. I recently went back to therapy and my mother has refused to let me drive, so I have to depend on her for rides to appointments and due to it, I haven't seen my therapist on over three weeks. But what saved me today from swallowing half a bottle of oxy? My chubby, mean cat saw me crying on the kitchen floor and shoved her sweet face into my stomach. I've been at low points but all of it equating one answer was the cherry on top and my pet saved me today. I don't know about the world tomorrow, but I know I was loved today.

42,"First Reddit post here, feel the need to write this out. Almost a year ago, last April, I broke up with my boyfriend of seven years. It was a shitty break up, but the relationship had been going downhill for a while, it seemed like the better choice. It still hurts, it's difficult to come to terms with losing someone who I was close to for so long, but it wasn't working out and I was becoming resentful.  

Unfortunately, we still live together, and now when we're both home at the same time, he ignores me, he hasn't spoken ten words to me over the last month and a half. I can't move out yet, because I can't afford anywhere alone and the guy I'm kind of dating now has to wait another few months before he can move out from where he is. I don't have many people to socialize with, so if they're busy, I go days without speaking to another person. It's starting to get to me. 

I've been feeling really horrible the last two weeks when I'm home, I have no desire to do anything, even when I know I need to. Nothing is interesting to me, I generally just want to sleep, but, because I'm quite an anxious person, I haven't been sleeping well either. If I'm hanging out with guy I'm dating, I'm pretty okay, but as soon as he has to leave or I have nothing to look forward to, I feel so lonely. 

I would crash at this guy's house, which worked out pretty well, but his roommate decided to tattle on their landlord that I was staying over (that's another story), so now I'm always home, and being ignored constantly is getting to me.

\- Has not had a job in over a year because he says he is too good for jobs that he thinks are ""below"" him so then he doesn't get a job. 

\- Seems completely irrational about everything. 

\- Said he is the most intelligent and talented person going for every job and he is overlooked because the system is rigged. Now he no longer applies and for every job he says he would be better than all the candidates. 

\- Says he is not depressed (when I asked him).

\- Says he does not have social anxiety (when I asked him) and then yelled at me and became furious.

\- Only has one friend who he favours over me. 

\- Drinks alcohol during the day and thinks it's funny. Sends me photos of him drinking and doing nothing.

\- Sleeps till midday every day. 

\- When I asked him what he did that he just sits there all day staring at the wall doing nothing. 

\- Says that he is very unlucky but yet won't do anything to change that. Refuses to apply for jobs. He keeps saying to me ""why did God do this to me?""

\- Obsessed with social media and is on it all day, posting etc. When I asked him why he does this he became furious and shut down all his accounts and then said that people were getting ""inspiration"" from him (!?) and that now they wouldn't because I made him shut them down (I didn't).  

\- Has cheated with me before by sexting women online but denies it ( the woman contacted me with proof). 

\- Said that he hates women and people of my race. 

\- Goes into rages with no reason, just yelling incomprehensibly.

\- Accuses me of all types of thing. 

\- Has a phobia about getting a bad illness and dying.

\- My friend died and instead of consoling me he said ""too bad it wasn't me"". 

\- Told me that he is someone special who has been disrespected and overlooked by society and when he dies people will appreciate his genius and gifts like Gandhi or Jesus. That he will be world famous. 

\- Tells me I need to lose weight and work out even though I work out every day and am at lower end of healthy weight range. 

\- Tells me I need to work harder even though I work hard every day and he sits at home doing nothing.

\-  As he does not work, he borrows money for everyone he knows to support himself.

44,"I'm primarily looking for some practical advice or guidance if anyone has any to share.

For some background: I am 29. I spent four years in the Army. Never deployed, never had any major head injuries (slammed my helmetted noggin into the ground pretty hard once, but it just gave me a headache for a night, never noticed any lingering effects beyond that), and had one major injury that affected my ankle and spine. It was a fairly stressful time, and following my time in service the VA diagnosed me with ""adjustment disorder with mixed depression and anxiety."" 

My question is how does stress and depression affect memory and cognition? I've been out of the military for over a year, my stress and blood pressure is way down, but I'm noticing more and more that my memory and my attention seems to be shot. I have a difficult time remembering details, I have a very hard time finding things (I looked around my kitchen for 30 minutes today trying to find a thermometer, including looking directly at the thermometer 10 times, and I still needed my girlfriend to come show me where it was), and it seems fairly difficult for me to follow mundane plans or directions for routine life events like returning phone calls or planning shopping trips.

If I don't write things down, I may as well have never heard them. It's like I permanently tune out information if I don't specifically stop to take note of them. I've started using Trello to keep track of my life and I've been using another web service to record notable life events because it's getting harder to recall the details of those events. Finding things that are not specifically where I put them is almost impossible. 

To caveat this: my abstract reasoning and memory is fully on point. I pull straight-As at college, I can discuss political events with great detail, I can ramble about philosophy or programming with seemingly no deterioration from when I first learned what I'm talking about, I can remember the plot points from TV shows for over a year with about 80% accuracy. Anything academic or distant I can fully grasp and retain. Anything that has to do with practical life or mundane memory seems almost impossible for me to work with.

So, my questions are:

1) Is this likely a symptom of depression or stress? If so, what are some logical courses of action to address this?

2) Does anyone else experience a similar cognitive decline? Is there something that you're doing about it?

3) Does this sound like something that can be worked on, i.e. something that I could do exercises to improve? Or do I just need to get used to living my life with a bunch of lists?

4) Is there any specific name for what I'm describing? If I were to see a doctor about this, is there a term for this experience that would sum up what I'm seeking help with?

I've been having outbursts weekly which consist of me screaming and crying and throwing things in my apartment.

This is when she seems to snap back but immediately shuts down and falls asleep/goes unconscious(?). So far this only happened while we were in bed so luckily I didn't have to worry about her falling over and hitting her head. Now she's laying next to me, sleeping. I tried waking her up but I guess I'll let her rest for now.

Some background: She suffers from depression and anxiety, as do I but it's a lot stronger for her. She has therapy but doesn't go there regularly. She's off of her meds right now but she had those outbursts before when she took them so I doubt that's what's causing it. So yeah she has a long history with mental illness. I don't know how often this happens when I'm not around,if at all.
So what should I do? Does anyone know what's happening to her? I'm scared and worried.",19Jan2019,1

55,"First disclaimer: my first language isn't english so forgive me for any grammar error and such. I hope you'll understand what I'm asking. 

About 11 months ago I'd got a crush on a guy who didn't felt the same way about me and, long story short, he left (actually I pushed him away). Before that we would argue all days about anything and I started ruminating about anything (that situation, my university condition, family, friends and pretty much all my life). In the same period I started having panic attacks at night and so my insomnia got worse (I've got insomnia since high school). The panic attacks are gone, but I got really bad mood swings (from extremely angry to complete  despair, rarely happy). My plans for the future are gone and I've become very uncertain and ashamed about myself. Sometimes I even think that all the things that I'm feeling and thinking are just lies. A few months ago I pushed away all my friendships except for one. I rarely talk to my family and for my tendencies to be alone I'm terrified to remain single and without friends all my life.

I started this post with my ""heartbreak"" experience (it's ridiculous to use this word, but that was the feeling) because I began experiencing  discomfort from then, but I'm sure that it isn't the only cause. So 11 months are passed and I'm still frozen. I haven't a job (here it's hard to find one and knowing myself I would just quit university and began to work disappointing my family) and don't want my mom (my father died when I was 12) to pay for the therapist sessions also.

I'm sure I'm missing out on something. ",19Jan2019,1

59,"I used to be opposed to using mental health medication but I am at a point now where I am seeing it as a viable option.

I had been seeing a counsellor from May to December and it was really good, I was able to talk about all my issues. I completely opened up to them and looked an the ways thing impact my behaviour and why I have such bad anxiety. I went through some breathing exercises with her that really helped me control my anxiety. So I feel like I have really tried to get to the heart of my issues. 

However, the anxiety does still persist. Its affecting my sleep, I will do everything in one day to get to sleep, be exhausted, exercise that day, read, put phone on aeroplane mode an hour before, masturbate and write. Yet it seems to take me hours to fall asleep because I have this anxious energy inside me. I now have really bad eczema which is correlated with my anxiety. It's all over my scalp and can bleed and create puss.

Basically, I have tried to deal with my issues in a healthy way. But I feel the anxiety is so heavily in grained in me because of my formative years that it will take year and lots of discipline, Ie meditation everyday. I feel like am genetically disposed to this kind of thing, my dad has also had anxiety, my mum had an eating disorder for ten year and both my grandma's have been on antidepressants.

I am now in my last year of university and have to write my thesis this semester. Everything is overwhelming, however, I feel like that's coming out in physical ways like my sleep. I am starting to think about using anxiety medication as a stop gap to get myself through my last semester. Can any one offer any advice about them? 

TL;DR I am in final year of university and feeling very anxious. Tried to deal with anxiety in counselling but feel like it will be a long journey. Can anyone offer advice on using anti-anxiety medication?

60,"My best friend is having her second psychotic episode. Her first one was 5 years ago, when she was 24. She started accusing everyone of things that were not real, had visual hallucinations and made no sense at all. She went back to normal after a couple of days of medication. She was on it for about 2 years, then stopped taking it and was totally normal.

Her personality changed a lot though. She used to be super bubbly and lively and spontaneous. We were always the loudest everywhere we went and laughed the hardest. Since her first episode, she became an introvert, thinks everything super logical, had an 180 degrees career change and her empathy is lower (she isnt mean or selfish; she just doesn’t perceive things especially emotions if you dont tell her directly). I had to change a lot too and have always made sure she was comortable and not in situations that made her feel insecure and so on (large group of people, crowded areas, crazy lights, didn’t let anyone touch her phone or didn’t answer anyone questions about her etc).

I didnt know she hadn’t seen her psychatrist in two years. I began noticing something was off in summer and one month ago I was sure. She told me about some thought patterns she was having - the same as last time ( connecting memories and things that had no real connection to each other and being paranoid she is tracked and people want to hurt her).

She seeked help. Unfortunately things progressed to fast and now she is in a full blown psychotic episode again. We live in different countries and can’t do much. I begged her parents to get her fast to a doctor but they wouldn’t listen. Her friends over there the same.

I love her, she has been my best friend since 9th grade, I can’t imagine life wihout her. But I can’t imagine life anymore like this either - me always picking up the pieces, always being in the back and making sure she is OK whenever we hang out, then her going off the rails again, telling me the worst imaginable things (I know she is ill and it’s not really her, but we know each other so well, everything she says hits all my buttons), everybody else being super chill about it (let’s not upset her, let’s take things one step at a time etc - her parents have known about this for 2-3 weeks and just because she talks with them they think it’s not that bad this time and are not hurrying at all to get her medication. And all this time she is living alone abroad, isolating herself and god knows how much sleep or food she gets. One week ago she looked pale as a ghost and 3 kilos lighter when she is already thin). I feel all alone in this. 

Has anybody been successful with a similar situation? After her first episode the doctor said it might be paranoid schizophrenia, but had to monitor her. I guess he was right. I just feel tired of always paying attention to all the tiny details so she is comfortable, of dealing with her lack of empathy (which I know is only because of her condition) only for her not to go to the doctor, for her parents to be totally chill about it and then about this whole thing. It’s like they don’t realise a car could hit her anytime because she sleeps two hours a night because she is too busy looking for tracking devices in her house or overthinking everything.

Im just so tired of all of this and feel all alone in trying to help her and totally useless. I don’t know what to ask of her when she gets better besides to see her psychatrist on a regulat basis and go to therapy. I don’t even want to imagine going through this again. I don’t know how everybody else have the ability to distance themselves from the situation so well. It’s totally ruining my wellbeing and makes me feel frustrated, angry, lonely and just sad.

I thought it would be us taking over the world. And now it’s us working it out until all falls to pieces and I can’t do anything about it and no one will take me seriously or truly try to help get het back to normal :(",19Jan2019,1

62,"This is fucking. Insane. Idk why but I think I may have gotten some sort of stomach bug, food poisoning, or just nausea from the first day of my menstrual cycle. Of COURSE this had to fall on the day when I lose the most blood, so i essentially ate nothing, lost a shit ton of Iron, couldn't sleep as a nice touch, and (wait for it)....CHUGGED A SHIT TON OF BLACK COFFEE TO STAY AWAKE  

Darwin award everyone.

I had no idea what was going on at first, but thinking through it now it was so fucking obvious. I worsened effects of anemnia/iron deficiency/q general bad mental health streak I was having, to the point where now I literally am stuck in my own personal hell.

I call these ""hell attacks"" instead of panic attacks, maybe its PMDD but I've gotten them not around my period I believe. What I'd consider my panic attacks are nowhere near like this. I get an INTENSE, INSISTENT, MIND CRUMBLING, BODY SHAKING wave of paranoid thoughts, existential dread, almost been convinced it's an actual demon and I'm not even religious.

 It just genuinely feels sureal in a very satanic way. It has me convinced I may actually have some sort of clinical psychosis and I just want it to end, but this has been the worst yet. Thanks to the anemia, I have this psuedo tiredness where I can sleep. A WINK. I slept maybe an hour and I had the most restless, and weirdest nightmare ever of random numbers counting and me trying to stop them all??? So bizarre, felt like some kind of torture.

Has anyone ever experienced anything like this? My symptoms to start were hunger but barely being able to take in anything, and some crappy sleep, but now its instense dysphoria/paranoia/disassociation, nausea mixed with overwhelming dizziness, insomnia, panic, rapid heartbeat/shortness of breath, crying, shaking, and actually feeling like I'm dying.

All cause of a little blood loss and just being fucking stupid. ",19Jan2019,1

64,"Hi, I'm completely new to Reddit so I apologize if I'm not using this correctly.

I decided to join Reddit so I could get some insight from people that might have the same issues as I do. I only recently became open to my mother about the things going on in my head, and now that I've started talking about everything out loud, I'm beginning to realize it's not all exactly normal. I've struggled with anxiety my whole life, and was diagnosed with depression by my doctor when I was 13 after seeing my grandmother go into cardiac arrest and pass. I feel like I have overcome the depression, but not as much the anxiety. My mom's had health problems my whole life, and the older I get, the worse they get. About 2 years ago, my mom was diagnosed with an incurbale form of leukemia and rheumatoid arthritis. She was also diagnosed with gastroparesis after she had her gastric bypass reversed. She can't eat anything at all, and has to get all of her nutrients through a feeding tube. She's in pain nearly everyday and it hurts me so much seeing her like this because I love her dearly and I just wish I could help.   
I don't exactly know how to get everything into one post so I'm just going to list all of my odd ""problems"".   

* For the past year, I've been struggling with dissociation. 
   * This first manifested when I was a child. I used to dissociate whenever my anxiety was through the roof. It feels like I'm not at all apart of my body, and like I have no control over my body. The best way I can describe it is like watching life through a tv, or like life is just one long dream. It simply just doesn't feel real. I only had episodes like this every now and then when my anxiety was really bad, but I feel like I've been stuck in this state for well over a year. I thought this was because I smoked weed, but I've stopped smoking and I think it's gotten worse. I space out and feel completely disconnected almost everyday. It makes it very hard to concentrate on everything from reading, to holding complete conversations. 
* I'm an extremely paranoid person.
   * Now I talked to my mom about this, and she's pretty paranoid about some of the same things as me. Like I absolutely cannot go into public by myself without having an anxiety attack because I think every person that walks past me is going to attack me or snatch me. I think this is caused by all the shit I hear in the news, and my mom is equally paranoid about this. I've coped with this by bringing headphones with me everywhere I go so I can listen to music. Music is the only coping mechanism I've found that can actually calm me down.
   * Now this is where I think the paranoia is getting out of hand. I have an irrational fear of people hearing my thoughts. This started when I was a freshman, and I would ride the bus home. I would listen to my music and just talk to myself in my head and get lost in imaginary worlds. I don't know why, but I just started freaking out thinking everyone can hear what I'm thinking about. I know in my head that it is literally impossible for people to hear my thoughts, but I still have this problem. When I'm in public, I make it a point to say in my head, ""If you can hear me, raise your hand."" Of course nobody has ever raised their hand but I still have this fear. 
   * I'm paranoid of the government and hackers watching me through my cameras in my devices. I used to cover my laptop camera with tape, now I just tilt the screen back far enough so I know they can't see me. I'm also scared of them looking at my search history and constantly looking at whatever I do on my laptop and phone. I don't do anything illegal or even remotely weird. I only use my laptop for school (I do online school now) and every now and then to play video games. 
   * I live across the street from a school, so there's always people there and tons of cars. Even though I know the people are there because they work there, I still have episodes where I think someone is actually over there watching my house. There was one day in particular that I watched a white S.U.V. pull into the school parking lot, and I was overcome this feeling that they weren't there for school. I went around the house and closed all the blinds and sat in my room watching that one car. Of course, they never came over to the house, but I was still having a panic attack over it. This has gotten a little better because I constantly remind myself of that particular event, and remind myself that everyone in the parking lot is there for school. But I still have a deep gut feeling that people park at the school to watch my house.  
   * I live on a very sharp corner, so people have to go pretty slow around it. I tell myself over and over that people HAVE to go around the corner slow, but I still have this gut feeling that they're going so slow because they're looking into my windows, or they're sizing up the house to break in. 
   * I have episodes where I think people are in my house. I go around looking in every room for anybody, and I yell out to make sure nobody is there. This is extremely irrational because I have 6 dogs who bark at everybody and everything. So I know for a fact that if somebody were in my house, my dogs would let me know right away. 
* I have lots of ups and downs.
   * One day I can be super happy and productive. I clean the house, smile all day, and be super affectionate to my dogs and family. But then there's days where I wake up so fucking agitated. There will be no rhyme or reason to my downs. I've stopped reading the news on my phone in the morning because I thought maybe this was the cause of my downs. But it hasn't really changed. When I have my downs, I try to seclude myself from my family because even if they're all happy, any tiny little thing they say to me will make me even more agitated and I don't want to keep lashing out at them for no reason. 

This post is kind of a mess, but I needed to try and fit as much info in as I could. If anybody at all could help me it would be greatly appreciated it. I do eventually want to talk to a professional about all this, but I'm still working up the courage to do so. If anybody has any of the same problems, please let me know... I just want to feel normal.  ",19Jan2019,1

It got so bad that I went to rehab, after that I got a job at macdonalds and started renting a place, I got kicked out cause I let my mate stay there for a few days while I was out of town and he trashed the place. My paranoia was a lot worse at this point and I had to quit my job, I couldn't get on a benefit cause the system kept fucking my around. I said fuck it and used the last of my money to by a plane ticket to a pretty remote island with just under 800 inhabitants, I was a lot less paranoid there, the locals were nice, and I fished, hunted and did odd jobs for food and places to stay.

Through CBT therapy I have been getting really much better haven’t had a panic attack in weeks though my general anxiety everyday is still the same

I've been playing Keyboard for years, self taught, I write rap songs, and I sing, everyone seems to think I'm very skilled in these areas and that I have a lot of musical talent, and I'm happy. It's nice to know that I actually have some kind of talent in me that I can enjoy. 

BUT I want to be good at something else, preferably a game. But here's the massive problem with my mindset; If I don't see immediate improvement in my skill at said hobby or game, I instantly get depressed and quit the hobby or game permanently, sometimes I even get suicidal and say that I'm worthless and talentless, but I'm not, as I stated earlier I seem to be gifted in musical areas, but I keep forgetting this and call myself worthless anyway because of my lack of talent at games. 

Sometimes even after improving I quit, for instance, I started playing Absolver recently, and despite being a noob at the start I quickly learned and started beating players that were twice my level or more, however I started losing a bunch afterwards which instantly killed my confidence, so I got angry, started crying and got depressed again, despite my impressive improvement I call myself terrible at the game. I want to change this. 

Games are supposed to be fun and exciting, and in some cases an outlet for stress or anxiety, a way to distract yourself and escape reality temporarily by picking up the controller and having some fun. However the thing is for me it's not a way to have fun, I tend to see games as something that I need to be skilled at no matter the cost, and that I just become better than others at said game to help subdue my own inferiority complex, but I don't want this, if I want to improve at a game, I want to do it calmly and reasonably, such as just playing the game normally and when I lose, I try to analyze the wrongdoings that I did in the game and try to correct them. But I don't do that, if I lose I just get depressed and pissed off and call it quits. This isn't healthy, and me berating myself just because I lost at a game that I may actually be decent at is starting to take a toll on my mental health. I feel the need to win, because if I do not win, I feel worthless. I want to be able to have fun even if I lose, I don't want to be a sore loser, I want to be someone who can take a loss and learn from it. But I can't, if I take a loss I become shattered, I can win against a thousand players in a row, but as soon as I come across somebody who manages to barely beat me just once, I lose all hope and confidence and start deprecating myself again. 

I don't know how to change this, this mentality has been concretely stuck to me for years, but I've had enough of it and need to change this. I want to become better and actually learn from my mistakes and have fun even if I make mistakes rather than lose control of my emotions. Does anybody have any tips? Any advice at all is greatly appreciated. ",19Jan2019,1
79,"Sorry this is long...My brother is refusing to let his 12 year old daughter go on an all expenses paid trip to Disney because he doesn’t like the way I talked to him when we were trying to choose dates. I got mad at him because every date he would choose I was unable to go (I’m taking her so it’s pretty important i can go) and then when he finally proposed a date that worked he immediately changed his mind because she would be gone for Father’s Day (He doesn’t even celebrate Christmas why would he even care about Fathers Day). I cut the trip a day short  so we’d be back the day before and he still wouldn’t commit so I said if you can’t commit to a date it’s too much money to waste I’m going to have to cancel the trip and tell her it’s your fault. Yes I got upset but I don’t think it was unwarranted after all the back and forth and I’m certainly not taking the fall for him if I have to tell niece we’re not going. He hasn’t spoken to me since. If I walk into a room he walks out of it. He has also stopped speaking to my father because my father said he didn’t see the point of punishing the child because he’s mad at me. This was October. My brother didn’t come to Thanksgiving or Christmas and hasn’t spoken to us since. I know this isn’t normal behavior. I can’t wrap my head around a parent punishing his child over something so trivial and she didn’t even do anything here. I know he thinks he’s punishing me but it’s like it doesn’t even occur to him that his daughter is going to be devastated because she thought she was going to Disney this year. Also, my brother hates Disney so he never plans on taking her himself and he let me take her a few years ago. Is this a mental health issue or something? Why is he acting like this? ",19Jan2019,1

86,"I just need to vent, sorry for any mistakes, English is not my first language. 

I’ve always had mental health issues. I was never properly diagnosed until a few months ago and it turned out I have social anxiety, BPD and PTSD. I’ve never had an eating disorder but I’ve always been really underweight because often I couldn’t eat when I felt anxious or nervous. Everyone always kept telling me that I’m too skinny and that it doesn’t look good. I always wanted to have a normal weight, but no matter how much food I ate, I was still underweight. 

And a few months ago, when I was finally properly diagnosed, I was prescribed some meds. They warned me one of the most common side effects is weight gain. And finally I did gain weight. But now my parents, especially my dad, keep telling me that I eat too much, that my arms and legs are too fat, that I should exercise more. And it’s like I do exercise almost every day, sometimes even too much (because I use exercise as a way to self harm). They just end up making me feel guilty when I eat something, I feel so bad for eating. And I don’t think I’m that fat, I weigh 55 kg and my height is around 161 cm, so I think that’s pretty normal. I don’t know, I’m just so tired of their comments, they’re never happy, for them I’m either underweight or overweight but there’s nothing in between",19Jan2019,1
87,"Hi thanks in advance,

I have been working at my job in (Finance) for 3 years and my supervisor, every time I ask him a question on a project, will call me out in front of the team, reprimand me for asking a question and/or condescendingly, in a aggressive way, explain things to me in a very hostile and negative manner. Here is a short list of things he has said to me in an **open office** setting wherein everybody can hear:

1. ""Okay, how many times have I told you, not to interrupt me while I'm thinking"" after I politely ask him a question.
2. ""How have you been here for three years and still don't know how to run analyses"" after I ask him what areas should our analysis focus on.
3. ""You cannot use prior work as a template for the current ask. this looks terrible, where did you even get this information from?"" after he reviews my work. 
4. ""Can you come here i have a question for you."" I walk over to his desk. He makes me wait for about 2-3 minutes and the says, ""never mind, I found the answer"": he has done this about 3 to four times   
I know that there are certain personalities and traits that come with people in finance field but we work on the same floor with upper management and this is what hurts me the most; I see how upper management and my coworkers look at me every time he ridicules me and/or treats me that way. I feel helpless and angry at the same time and completely isolate myself from coworkers feeling shameful and embarrassed. It has even carried over into my personal life in which I am super quiet around my wife and kids and don't wan't to do anything with them. I grew up in a very masculine (factory working household) environment where violence and yelling was the answer to everything so im used to dealing with angry people and hurtful comments. And I have thick skin and rarely have petty incidents like these affect me but have a family to provide for. But over the last 6 months or so I have let it get to me and for some reason am unable to shake the anger and the shame I feel because of my supervisor. I brought it up to the director of our department through two different emails after two separate occasions and she said she has spoken with my supervisor and/or will ""take-care of it."" And since then, the director has left and for about the last year and a half, I've been dealing with his pompous A-hole. I have also spoken to him on multiple occasions but he still continues to treat me this way. 

I know i can get another job but this job pays me well and the health care insurance is the best I've ever had ( my wife has a medical condition with expensive drugs for treatment), so leaving will be a financial mistake on my part and out of the realm of possibilities. 

I'm so angry at myself for setting myself up and placing myself in situations where he can do this to me. I always blame myself. I have tried to avoid dealing with him through headphones, going to other coworkers with questions and ignoring his snide comments but here we are. I am mad and have not talked to any of my coworkers for five days since the last incident. 

​

I've also gone to HR but HR sides with him cause upper management loves the work product that he provides and tells HR to tell me to ""lighten-up""

90,"I'm taking welbutrin for concentration/focus issues and depression(I personally didn't think I was all that depressed, neither did the psychiatrist but..)
Originally I wanted help because I am constantly forgetting where I put things, not hearing all the details in conversations and just not doing what I know I should be doing like time just gets away from me, constantly forgetting things.. I don't feel sad. Days I feel happy and good, it's just my memory. 
Back to this though, I've been prescribed 75mg twice a day, Morning and noon.
Ive noticed I feel nauseas, fatigued, numb and very irritable. It's making me feel worse than before I started taking them. 
Im not usually like this... I have been in the past but I've gotten much better, especially with meditation.
Ive had experience with anti depressants before (years ago) and I got bad side effects quickly from those too.

I’m now 22 and feeling the worst I ever have in my entire life. I don’t care for my future. I don’t care for friends. I have zero. I have absolutely no desire for social interaction or achievements or anything. I can literally sit in a room for hours and do nothing.
