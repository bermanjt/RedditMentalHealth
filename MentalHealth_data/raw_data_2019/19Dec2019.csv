0,"I've had depression for what seems like ages but lately it's gotten progressively worse. I went through a phase of suicidal thoughts and actions and I got some medication changes and that helped. 

I had a heart to heart with my wife about something I'd been carrying since I was little and she was OK with it and that felt awesome. 

I rode that feeling for about two weeks but things have turned. All this week I've cried at the slightest thing and can't seem to put words to my feelings and while I'm not suicidal right now I can't imagine I'm not too far off and I can't seem to tell my wife about it. I'm not even upset at the thought though. When I was feeling that way before I was a total mess.

I'm able to my job but otherwise can't seem to form a thought that makes sense. I'm having a hard time even typing this. It's taking forever to correct all the mistakes.

It's like my mind is sliding away and I can't get a hold on it. I wish I knew what the hell was going on.",19Dec2019,1
1,Feeling like life isn't real. That it's all just passing by. With me looking on without intervention of myself. I feel depersonalized to everything. Like I got my head stuck in the cloud. Me trying to pull me back to earth with my mind. Just not happening though.,19Dec2019,1
2,"I am a teenager and I don‚Äôt really have any close/good friends. I constantly feel lonely and bored. I wasn‚Äôt always like this. I used to have lots of wonderful friends and felt happy sometimes. Lately, I have cut off some of those relationships because I had to focus on school, and ever since I‚Äôve been focused on school, I‚Äôve had a very difficult time talking to people. I often feel disconnected and uninterested in keeping up with people and making plans to hang out with people, even though I crave friendship. I miss hanging out with best friends and having fun with them and sharing secrets. But it seems the older I get, the more lonely I am. I have a twin sister, but it‚Äôs not the same as having a best friend. I am just really bored and I feel empty all of the time and I don‚Äôt know how to change. Any advice?",19Dec2019,1
3,"I feel pathetic, I cry all the time. How am I supposed to last in 'society' if I'm so fucking pathetic. Let's present some work, oh wait no time to have a breakdown and make everyone in the class go ""aww"" ""You okay?"". Let's listen to a friend's problem, oh wait time to overthink it and panic and cry and have them worry about you instead. I wish I was strong like Ive been told to be, I've been told to stop crying but I can't. I'm not suicidal but I wish I was never born. I wish I was stronger, sometimes I want to kill someone or hurt someone because it makes me feel good, it makes me feel powerful.",19Dec2019,1
4,"I have no idea if this is normal or not but I get really frustrated, upset and even angry (sometimes) when plans suddenly change or things don't go my way/ the way I had planned them. For example, last christmas my sister became ill on the day our family goes out as like a tradition type thing I guess (we go to the same place every year on the same day before christmas) and I completely flew off the handle despite being totally aware that it was unreasonable to be angry at something that wasn't her fault! I have no clue what this means, help?",19Dec2019,1
5,"My partner is quite suicidal and depressed along with having PTSD. I wanted to know what I could do to help her as best I can. She switches from happy to angry/sad very often and it often brings me down too. I want to know how to communicate with her regarding her trauma. Nothing I say snaps her out of it and neither should it because it's trauma and not a quick fix. However I still would like information on how to just be there correctly and safely for her as best I can.

I‚Äôm taking the brave step to shave off all my hair and start again! I plan to step into the new year with a whole new mindset and motivation and hopefully it will keep my hair nice and strong and help it flourish.

8,"I've never posted owt but I just felt to rant. I've spent nearly 12 years of my life dealing with shite. I was abused physically, verbally and mentally at the age of ten for around 4 years, I had nearly been stabbed and was strangled nearly daily it ruined my life and my entire outlook on life and people. I had to grow up and look after my baby sisters and protect them. Eventually the person was removed after police and social services got involved. I though ti could escape and went off the rails for a bit at school, but when I left and got to college I thought it would be over but no it came back to bite me, I ended up with anxiety which had appeared here and there before but I didn't identify it at the time, depressions and ptsd. Everything's fallen apart fro me I can't work the jobs I want, Im unable to do anything and I spend my days just staring feeling empty, I don't talk to anyone and when I do I always seem to pick the from people as I get throw to the side with little care. I can't form relationships or friendships because I struggle to even talk to people to even pop up, and when I do they eventually get bored and move on or just leave because its effort to try with someone who is emotionally and physically  broken. Never felt so alone or confused in my life I despise everything I am at the moment and it gets worse daily therapy helps but I just feel worse at times. Just needed to vent sorry allüôè",19Dec2019,1
9,"I'm a 20 year old male. Couple years back I moved out of my hometown for college, leaving the one friend I had and my mom who I consider to be my best friend. At the time unbeknownst to me I was extremely depressed, but it cost me my first relationship to acknowledge that I had a problem(s), like anger issues and antisocialness. I can confidently say I am a lot better now and whilst there are some issues like having episodes every now and then, I'm in a much better place overall. My one problem is socialising. I used to never make the effort to socialise because I was just in a self pity loop but I realised a while back I NEED company. I have what I'd call ""acquaintances"" but not really friends. By that, I mean, I'm the type of friend to them that's kind of the backup plan, never the priority, and no matter how hard I try this doesn't change regardless of the individual. I'm starting to feel like there's something *wrong* with me even though objectively speaking, there isn't. The invisible wall between me and people seems to only get thicker over time. Perhaps its just my age group, since the rare occasions I make any connections is with those older than me (but age gaps make friendships a bit more awkward as you can imagine), but I've no idea how to go about making friends. I constantly go to events and meetups with people with similar interests and such but even with them, I'm sort of treated like a... side character for lack of a better word. I know no one will instantly like and befriend me, which is why I put in the effort. Yet it just doesn't seem to do much.
 Thoughts?
TL;DR: Hard time socializing. I'm not anxious around people anymore, in fact I'm incredibly relaxed because I'm confident in myself as a person, but I just can never actually make any fruitful connections or be seen as anything more than a backup plan.",19Dec2019,1
10,"I‚Äôve always had some kind of issue I was never a normal kid I used to be obsessed with fire and I was always getting in trouble. I believe as early as year 1 in reception I had an obsession of taking stuff from the school which resulted in my trousers being sewed shut. I experienced sucidal ideation and a lot of anger as a kid (started in the middle of primary school ) and would constantly worry about my grandads health and would get visibly upset and quite hysterical about it even in the middle of primary school and even say remarks ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want live anymore‚Äô etc.

The reason why I was so bothered about my grandad is because him and my grandmother took the role of both my parents because both my parents took a dark path in life and experienced drug addiction of hard drugs (heroine mainly) and suffered from severe mental health.

Fast forward to year 6-7 I‚Äôve started at this point to calm down a bit and my emotions aren‚Äôt as messy but  I‚Äôm still disruptive and can‚Äôt concentrate in class. Then from this to year 9 everything was going ok I was starting the process of maturing and I wasn‚Äôt half as bad as I was in primary school but nothing prepared me for what news I was going receive.

It was a night on a weekday and my other grandad comes into my grandparents house and shouts me down but it sounded like he was angry so I was confused on what is happening so I went down and I could see he was visibly upset and he preceded to tell me the news that my dad had passed away last night. I didn‚Äôt know how process this but it felt like I was punched in the chest it was a feeling I had never really experienced before and I believe is one of the reasons why I‚Äôm feeling  like this today.

It effected me because even though he wasn‚Äôt looking after me he was still in my life a lot and still did dad things with me I guess it bothered me as well because I wanted to go on holiday with my parents when I was older because I never got experience when I was younger and j felt like that was ripped away from me. This proceeded to manifest into a lot of mental health issues from year 9 and eventually got myself kicked out of school.

Let‚Äôs jump to present times. Recently I had a really bad experience on drugs I nearly lost my life and I think i experienced psychosis well I stayed in hospital I found out my grandad who looked after me is terminally ill and has really deteriorated since he got diagnosed and is now in the dying stage and showing a lot of delusion and agitation.

This is where I get to the issues I‚Äôm having myself. I just don‚Äôt feel emotions like I used too anymore. I don‚Äôt feel sad about this don‚Äôt feel like crying I don‚Äôt feel anything (when my dad passed away I was hysterical). I‚Äôve started sleeping less and my eating and drinking is shot  I rarely eat and have about 3 small glasses of water even that. I‚Äôve started isolating myself and rarely leave the house or talk to people. I start thinking about events which happened ages ago in my life and start getting paranoid what people think about me. I can‚Äôt go out much especially at night because I fear I‚Äôll get killed. I have no clue what is happening here and hopefully have some guidance because this shit is crazy .",19Dec2019,1

And it feels like I‚Äôve reached the point with yet another job, a job that I care about, where I fall apart and don‚Äôt recover.

I‚Äôve gone to therapy for years, have consumed tons of self help material, have practiced affirmations, I write, I‚Äôve done ERP (though, if I‚Äôm being honest I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve done enough).

So, last year I started crying myself to sleep every Sunday night, because that's when I know I will always be alone and no one will see, and it's like starting the week fresh

well things are starting to get bad again and I've gotten into the habit of literally scheduling times to cry. I just had to move my reminder to cry from Saturday to tomorrow, cause I don't know if I'll make it to Saturday

21,"I‚Äôm feeling incredibly frustrated by family and household issues, so I‚Äôll break it down:

1. All the members of my family are depressed on different levels and it‚Äôs taking a major toll on my own mental health. I struggled with a severe case of it myself and have only emerged out the other end a few years ago. I‚Äôm still healing and it‚Äôs been so hard to try to manage my mental health while worrying about theirs. I don‚Äôt know what to do. It‚Äôs changing the people around me greatly and I acknowledge that these might not be voluntary character changes but it‚Äôs so hard. There‚Äôs a family member who‚Äôs older than me who‚Äôs essentially turning into a person who can‚Äôt be reasoned with. I‚Äôm really struggling to deal with this person‚Äôs refusal to take any personal responsibility for anything and has no interest even in basic personal maintenance and simultaneously thinks they know everything while relying on others for everything. 

2. As a result of this group depression, our house is a serious mess and we‚Äôve developed a bug infestation. People are unwilling to part with things we don‚Äôt need and that‚Äôs the core of the mess problem. I don‚Äôt know how to talk it out either because everything reaches a deadlock whenever it‚Äôs attempted or brought up. I‚Äôm not looking to move out or anything either, but I just want all of us to value our environment more.

3. And like a cherry on top, our financial situation isn‚Äôt the worst but it isn‚Äôt where it should be either. I‚Äôm about to start university and the cost of that is going to be a burden once I‚Äôm done. Nobody is employed either‚Äîpartially because it‚Äôs genuinely hard to find a job in our city but also because the effort to find one just isn‚Äôt there. 

Any advice would really help me out. I‚Äôm feeling like I‚Äôm drowning as the only child in this family. I don‚Äôt really have anyone to turn to in solving these problems and I do feel like it‚Äôs on me to get the ball rolling. I want to so something but lately all I feel like I can do is either cry or go off on someone which both feel miserable and unproductive",19Dec2019,1

No matter what though, I‚Äôll keep trying‚Äîsimply because it‚Äôs necessary to learn. I love my husband and my daughter, I will love the baby growing inside of me.

24,"I‚Äôve had minor tics and obsessional tendencies for much of my life, but I‚Äôve always had my own ways of coping with them that I was happy with.

Somewhat recently I got a provisional diagnosis from a therapist (whom I was seeing for other reasons) of OCD, and searching further online I saw that this is supposedly a lifelong condition that cannot be cured that you‚Äôre stuck with and the only treatment for which is formal treatment with a professional. 

First, I didn‚Äôt really think that my symptoms matched this diagnosis. But besides that, I grew gradually more and more worried that the only way to deal with these things was by seeing a psych and going through formal treatment.

I guess I just want assurance that if I‚Äôve had my own means of dealing with these things‚Äîand that they‚Äôve worked throughout my whole life‚Äîthat I‚Äôm allowed to trust myself and continue what I‚Äôm doing instead of going through formal treatment; also, if I don‚Äôt believe that the label fits me then I don‚Äôt have to subscribe to it, and that labels in general aren‚Äôt super precise anyways.

26,"At first you're probably thinking, ""who does he think he is"" or ""what the fuck does he mean?"" 

But what I am saying is in my own mind, through anxiety, depression, substance abuse and misdiagnosis, can we really be trusted? 

When I say trusted, I don't mean evil or callous...

We are all a part of this thread, our own lives, but if we need help, how can offer advice or judgement against each other etc? 

I went to an AA meeting a couple of times, and it suddenly dawned on me. Here we are at different stage of recovery, all strangers in a room with the same problem. It dawned on me that I need help, professional help. 

That's when I stopped becoming an arm chair adviser and started to listen to the triggers and signals and speak solely to professionals.

Of course I'm not saying everyone is right or wrong, but when I'm unstable I woulsnt want to give advice, because I cannot trust my own mind and its perception of myself and the world. 

While sharing stories is great and having open discussions, reddit wont fix it.

At first, when I began to see and hear things, it was minor, and could be ignored if I really tried hard. I would mainly see odd patches of color and hear subtle things like the sound of water constantly behind me or the sound of children playing (when I looked around, there were never any children).
  
  
Now, the children have developed into much more than just background noise, and constantly whisper or shout at me, or. When I'm not expecting it, I'll suddenly hear their soft giggles coming from inside my head, or their sudden demands to *""finish it""*, whatever that means, and when I look around, like always, there's nobody. 
  
  
I also sometimes see full sized shadows rush past me or see one just standing next to me and staring my way. I also sometimes see several little bugs swarming me or the area in front of me, even when there aren't any. 
  
  
Some part of me knows that it's not real, but it really is getting hard to tell sometimes, and I've already made a fool of myself a few times recently swatting at crowds of bees that nobody else could see, or demanding that someone shuts up, even when nobody is talking.

So at the beginning of the school year I have fallen in the deep depression hole that drastically changed my grades. The beginning of the year was absolutely awful. My family has went through so much stuff within a little time period and we're just now recovering from it. The simplest things started to become a challenge. Just getting out of bed became a challenge. All of that has led me to now. My grades are awful, I still feel like I'm not here mentally, and I still just feel like a huge disappointment to my parents. I'm sorry if I seem like I'm just whining about my problems because I really don't mean to come off that way. This is the only place i feel like I can actually let out all of my emotions. Grades go out to parents at the end of the week and I've been working really hard but it doesn't seem like enough. It feels like there's no way out of this stress. I haven't really been able to fall asleep at night because I'm too anxious about all of it. And I know if I tell my parents about all of this it won't do any good. It will just add on to their problems and I will just be a burden. Sorry about all of that. I just needed to let all of that out.",19Dec2019,1

42,"So, I plan on seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist as soon as my insurance kicks in from my relatively new job. Until then, I've been trying to find solutions to the thungs that makes me anxious. 

I've successfully found solutions to a few things but I need some advice on some things I could do about my face. 

My face makes me extremely anxious. People tell me nothing is wrong with it, but I genuinely feel like my face is disfigured 99% of the time. I know that sounds really dramatic, but it's true. There are times where I can feel things like a hole in my cheek or a huge gash on my lips. It isn't always the same thing but it ALWAYS feels like my face is disfigured and like everyone knows how disgusting my face really is but aren't saying anything about it just be nice. 

I usually wear a full face of makeup every single day and I always wear beanies that cover my forehead. I had a paid of sunglasses I wore most of the time that completely covered my eye area but they broke. I alsp have a few scarfs I wear to cover my chin and mouth in public. 

I've been trying not to wear so much makeup every day because I'm worried it'll distroy my face over time and looking in the mirror hurts too much now. It's gotten a lot worse sense I got this job and am now forced to be around people daily.

If anyone has any tips or advice on what might help me for a few more weeks until my insurance kicks in, please let me know.",19Dec2019,1
43,"At this point I feel like I‚Äôve pushed away most of the people in my life who I was able to talk to about my issues, aside from my therapist but idk. I just have no one to vent to so here I am. Read it or not, it doesn‚Äôt matter I just need to get it out.

Im completely convinced right now *basically* everyone in my life hates me. Starting w my coworker who is pissed I got a promotion. If she wanted it, I‚Äôm not sure. I didn‚Äôt tell her before I went for it because I didn‚Äôt want to seem fucking dumb if I didn‚Äôt get it. I feel like she‚Äôs mad I didn‚Äôt tell her and she‚Äôs mad I got it because I‚Äôm significantly younger. It‚Äôs been so awkward at work around her and it sucks because I‚Äôve wanted this for a while and now it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt even enjoy it because someone who I was close to at work has basically iced me out. Now I‚Äôm technically her boss too and not that I‚Äôve changed my demeanor towards her at all, and I would never, she‚Äôs just so weird around me and it‚Äôs really upsetting. I feel like my friends think my work is dumb so I can‚Äôt talk about this.

I‚Äôm completely convinced my therapist and dietician are about to write me off. Reason being, I went to a psych thru a referral and it ended w her suggesting in ADHD and need a stimulant, I wasn‚Äôt completely open about abusing adderall in the past with her and yeah I don‚Äôt think my therapist and dietician are happy with me. I cancelled my therapy for today and rescheduled for Monday, wish I just went today and got a read on jt IRL. My dietician normally texts me almost everyday and I haven‚Äôt heard from her since I told her what this psych thinks. We don‚Äôt have an appointment set up for this week, and sometimes she‚Äôll text me abt it or I‚Äôll text her and it‚Äôs been radio silence. I‚Äôm literally convinced she‚Äôs done with me and I‚Äôve been so upset about it all day I‚Äôve wanted to cry. I feel like I totally fucked up at this appointment I went to Monday and that they‚Äôre both so frustrated with me that they‚Äôre just done. Again I can‚Äôt talk to any of my friends about this because it‚Äôs just like idk personal. 

My friends, I never even see them anymore. Like I kind of do but not really. I get that we‚Äôre all older with our own lives but I feel like I try and listen as much as I can and never really get it back. I have one friend who wants what‚Äôs best for me and I‚Äôve done nothing but push her away as much as I can. I choose to be around my other friends, who while they‚Äôre good friends, they don‚Äôt push for what this one friend does. Said friend is pretty in line with my therapist and dietician and i know she means well but it‚Äôs just like I don‚Äôt want to hear it so it‚Äôs easier to avoid her. My other friends just use me as a sounding board for venting to and I feel like idk. That no one really has my back and I‚Äôve been thinking about it like if I really needed help who would I call? I don‚Äôt even know anymore. I would have been able to have easily answered this months ago.

My family is meh. My mom has cancer and isn‚Äôt doing great, my dad is either a good guy or the biggest dick ever. Then that just really leaves my aunt, uncle, and grandpa. I‚Äôm pretty sure they all think I‚Äôm a loser who‚Äôs going no where. 

Myself. I‚Äôm 27, I‚Äôm making decent money for where I live, but I‚Äôm single and have been. I‚Äôm still living home, most of my friends are moved out, all with their significant others. I cannot afford it on my own, I may be able to with this promotion but I‚Äôm not sure. And I just feel like I‚Äôm going to be forever alone, with everyone hating me. It just leads me to the whole what is the point in anything  anymore? I‚Äôm constantly on edge and paranoid and the only thing that helps is having a few drinks so lol I guess I‚Äôm an alcoholic too. 

I just needed to vent. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me, I can‚Äôt get a diagnosis or anyone to be on the same page. I hope eventually things get better but I feel very stuck and have felt this way for a while. Thank god for my puppy because she‚Äôs the only thing keeping me here at the point. I just don‚Äôt want to do it anymore. I really am so drained and I just give up. I just wish I wasn‚Äôt such a problem and could have genuine relationships and a genuine support network. But that just isn‚Äôt in my cards I guess. Hopefully at least one day I can stop being so paranoid but it‚Äôs hard when I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs not paranoia and everyone hates me and would be better off if i was just gone.",19Dec2019,1
44,"Some quick background, I‚Äôve witnessed half of my close family members get terminally ill, deteriorate, and die before my eyes. I‚Äôve seen and gone through a lot of emotional trauma and I‚Äôm surprised I‚Äôm as good as I am tbh.

Just as an example of what I‚Äôm referring to, I‚Äôm currently dating this girl. Typically I have trust issues with everyone but so far with this girl I‚Äôve gained  a lot of natural trust very quickly with her which is unusual. It may be my mental bias as I haven‚Äôt had a relationship in almost 2 years, or mentally I just really trust her, idk for sure.

It is a short distant relationship, as in a short distance away, which is new for her and I both. She‚Äôs going away to school for only a year and is already have way done, thankfully. I guess what constantly goes through my mind, however, is constantly worrying she‚Äôs gonna lose interest or worried someone else may come along. We‚Äôve only been dating for 1-2 weeks, so it may just take time, but how do you guys deal with this? It‚Äôs so good to me and I‚Äôm happy and I have this constantly fear somethings gonna happen. I guess half the problem is she‚Äôs not super expressive, so I don‚Äôt get CONSTANT reassurance everything is good.

I stress more about this than actually looking and the bigger picture and realizing I‚Äôm in a relationship which is great. I‚Äôve been waiting for something for a long time now and she came into me on top of it.",19Dec2019,1

I need help but don't know how to ask. Or even who. If I tell my family they'd be heart broken. I can't tell my friends, they're going through things themselves and don't want to add to it. I feel so clouded and panicked. I don't know what to do.",19Dec2019,1

47,"Okay so I‚Äôm 21, he‚Äôs 22, we‚Äôre 10 months apart. I‚Äôll give you a background on my crazy brother.. I hope he doesn‚Äôt find this and hurt me because I feel like he would. Also sorry this is long as fuck

He has NEVER felt empathy for anyone. He would inflict pain on me or my animals and just he laugh
As a kid I remember watching him throw my cat around and laugh, pulling its hair and traumatising the shit out of it every day, with big eyes.
I have never seen my brother cry.
He is extremely charismatic to my parents and they love him but as soon as they go away on holiday he becomes violent, aggressive and shows his true colours only around me. He doesn‚Äôt have many friends, people find him odd.
He‚Äôs completely fucking detached from reality, I feel like I‚Äôm talking to a robot.
When he doesn‚Äôt get his way or a slight comment pisses him off he will smash windows, punch walls and doors, he‚Äôs been in HUNDREDS of fights with my dad, my mums called the cops a few times (my parents doesn‚Äôt even bother addressing his behaviour now because he knows he won‚Äôt win), his anger is the worst I‚Äôve ever seen in my life.
He‚Äôs thrown plates at me, punched me etc
He has physically abused me up until this day (not as often now, maybe a couple times a year he‚Äôll threaten to kill me). my parents are amazing parents but they were so scared of him they didn‚Äôt know what to do. They never saw how bad he truly was towards me. they‚Äôd be at work until 5/6pm so we‚Äôd catch the bus home together and he would take out his anger on me by chasing me around the house, threatening me with knives and his fist. He was bullied bad, he didn‚Äôt have many friends. He was quiet, smart as fuck, loved mine craft and Xbox games. Because he was bullied he loved to use me as a punching bag to let it all out after school. My parents didn‚Äôt see how bad it really was towards me. In front of them he still hurt me but nowhere NEAR as bad.
From about the age of 9 onwards, from what I can remember, I developed severe psychosis but I had no idea it was because of my brother, I was manipulated so bad for YEARS and I was blinded by him. I legit had no idea I had psychosis until about grade 11 when I was 17 and people told me I‚Äôm so jumpy and scared, and for years I‚Äôd think people were planning to kill me..
When I was 14 it was at the worst point ever, he was still abusing me and I stopped catching the bus home so I had to walk for over an hour and my parents would be home soon after I arrived so I didn‚Äôt feel as unsafe. 
At this time I thought people were genuinely planning to kill me, I couldn‚Äôt walk by myself even in broad daylight without having 5-10 panic attacks on the way home, looking behind me constantly imagining there was a person following me
I always thought this was because I was scared after hearing about kids being abducted by pedophiles in this day and age, but looking back now I realise my brother had fucked me up so bad mentally and physically that I was just in a constant state of fight or flight.
So I told my school counsellor and she called my parents in and threatened to call child protective services if he doesn‚Äôt get help. He finally stopped the daily abuse, but would still verbally abuse me calling me a slut and still does today, maybe once or twice a month

But this is where it gets weird. When he was 16 and I was 15 he started smoking weed. He still hasn‚Äôt quit, smoking about $150 worth a week. He‚Äôs great when he‚Äôs high, but as soon as he‚Äôs sober he‚Äôs even more fucked than how he was before he started smoking pot. He‚Äôs been showing signs of psychosis for about a year. My mum and dad know he‚Äôs different but they are so confused and he won‚Äôt accept help or treatment.

Here‚Äôs some things I‚Äôve noticed:

He has never showered much, maybe once a week at most. It‚Äôs gotten worse with age. Working full time everyday as a trades worker he is covered in grease and oil but still doesn‚Äôt shower. 

He hasn‚Äôt brushed his teeth in atleast a decade. 

He freaks out about his health when he‚Äôs not high, saying he thinks he‚Äôs dying because he thinks he has heart problems or a brain tumour or a terminal illness (I think that‚Äôs psychosis)

He threatens suicide if anyone addresses his behaviour or says something he just doesn‚Äôt like So we can‚Äôt say anything we know he won‚Äôt approve of

He earns $800 a week but won‚Äôt eat at home because he refuses mums cooking and spends all his pay on meals. He spends that $800 within the first few days. He‚Äôs impulsive as fuck and will spend any money he has, almost like he‚Äôs manic and feels like a king when he‚Äôs at the shops spending money

My parents give him $100-$200 a week and still pay his bills..

He gets everything he wants because they are Slightly scared of him

He doesn‚Äôt have friends, he has acquaintances but people don‚Äôt like him..

Okay this is a big one: whenever he sees me if I just came out the shower and I‚Äôm in a towel walking to my room or I say something like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt come in I‚Äôm getting dressed‚Äù he becomes violent like psychotic violent and screams ‚Äúwhy the fuck would I want to come in and see you naked‚Äù .. I saw a therapist and he told me this could be a sign of incest behaviour because he‚Äôs having intrusive thoughts about me that he can‚Äôt get rid of
He‚Äôs also super intolerant of the fact that I have a boyfriend and finds it disgusting that I live with him now, and says aggressive comments that I can‚Äôt respond to like ‚Äú fuck off to your boyfriends house and shower‚Äù 

He also came out as bi to a family member but doesn‚Äôt know that I know, (not sure if that has anything to do with anything)

Another big one: been a few times in the past year or so that he‚Äôs said he‚Äôs planning my murder but laughs it off.. like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna kill you one day.. just kidding!!‚Äù .. is this a sign of psychopathy? I‚Äôm genuinely fucking scared. I‚Äôm so so SO fucking scared. I can barely even think about this I‚Äôm petrified

There‚Äôs so many more signs.. I don‚Äôt know what the fuck is going on but I want to get a restraining order because I‚Äôm scared that one day he‚Äôs going to kill me, BUT I‚Äôm too scared he will kill me if i get one!

I managed to get government support and move out a couple months ago with my boyfriend but there‚Äôs times when I come home to see my parents and very rarely it‚Äôs just me and him home (like right at this very minute which is why I‚Äôm posting this..)

Months will go by where he is fine and he‚Äôs happy (I think he smokes more weed during these time‚Äôs) but also he is very charismatic and charming towards the family so we sometimes forget how psychotic he really can be. Also sometimes he‚Äôll be out for 12 hours a day for weeks on end so we don‚Äôt see him much.. not sure where he goes tbh

Anyway so, Should I get a restraining order? I have crippling anxiety problems and still suffer from slight paranoia (I can‚Äôt catch public transport or go out much at night unless I‚Äôm with a group). Im seeing a therapist and he‚Äôs going to hypnotise next next week because I barely remember my childhood due to all the trauma. I love my family but I‚Äôm so worried that he‚Äôs draining the life out of my hard working loving parents, and I‚Äôm also worried I‚Äôm going to get fucking murdered one day. Please let me know if you‚Äôve experienced a similar situation and what you did because I‚Äôm at my wits end",19Dec2019,1
48,"TW/CW: dysfunctional family, neglectful and abusive parents

Hi all, I'm not sure if this the appropriate sub, so remove if not allowed.

I am a college student (20F) suffering from mental illnesses and chronic illnesses, thus am taking a leave of absence this semester. Currently living with my significant other. I have two younger brothers, a controlling mother, and neglectful father. Today, out of the blue, I got an apology text from my father. It stated that he was sorry for not being involved with me and the family, and how he wasn't supporting me as much. He said that work was busy this year, and he wished he could've been there for me when I was struggling. He wants to talk to me on the 23rd and possibly go out to do something fun.

I just don't know how to think about this. I am happy he wants to support me, but he has been neglecting our family for as long as I can remember. My mom would vent to me about how dad is uninvolved, and often lash out on me and get physical because she is frustrated with him. When I went to my dad for mental health issues and bullying, he would invalidate me and say that I have to be stronger and he acted like it is somehow my fault. All he does is work, and I'm trying to understand because that is how he expresses his love - by providing income and help us have a life without having to worry about financial stuff. However, he is so uninvolved when it comes to stuff other than work, and is reliant on me or my mom to do stuff like researching about HIS problems like sleep apnea and stuff. 

I want to accept his apology and try to work things out, but this has just been going on for so long that an apology through text is kind of not enough. I'm trying to be very understanding, but because of the fact that we had an unsupportive father figure, we went through so much and it has damaged our (at least mine) mental health. Any advice will help. x",19Dec2019,1

I have a friend (M 19) who lives in Egypt. He has currently suffered from constant heavy feeling, like depression I guess. I feel helpless because I live in another country, and we only contact online. I would like to ask for advice on what I could do for him.

I knew him about 2 years ago. He has been through a lot over these years, including bad study results, complicating changes and conflicts within his family, the death of his beloved friends and some breakdowns in other friendships. He and I have shared with each other, talked and played games and got over all those difficult times. Or so I thought.

I‚Äôve read that this kind of pain is like ocean waves. It may calm, and then will come from time to time. This time it appears that the wave has got really big and it may drown my friend. He has got so sad for no specific reason. He wants to keep distance from all friends, barely talks to anyone but me. Days ago, so as many times before - every once in a while, he told me he missed his friends so much - the passed away ones. He has also told me how tired he is, and that death feels like a better choice for the moment... We promised to visit each other, but recently he says he feels no goal in life. He is a religious person and now he has suicidal thoughts. That really worries me. Luckily (?) he said he would feel guilty for leaving me, since he knows I care about him.

Desperate as he is, I can hardly think of anything I could do to cover all the broken pieces and relieve the pain in him. I could listen to him, as long as he‚Äôs not gonna push me away as with other people. I‚Äôve tried to be understanding, but feeling like an outer for never being through the same situations. And of all the things I‚Äôve done, I‚Äôm no expert, who also has problems and might unintentionally mess things up. That‚Äôs why I come here for advice.

Since I don‚Äôt know Arabic and English is not our strength, I don‚Äôt feel my communication with him can do the best. Hence I‚Äôve come up with these ideas:
‚Ä¢ I would like to look for any reliable mental health services, or a group/community for people sharing the same problem in Egypt, so that I can encourage him to join and get proper help. I also considered posting in r/Egypt to ask about this.
‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm thinking of sharing small clips from my daily life with him, as well as encouraging him to film and share his. I want to think of more activities that we could do together since I‚Äôm unable to be with him in real life.

Is it advisable to do these things? For his situation, should I spend more time with him and talk to him more, or let him have some time alone? What more can I do for him?

I would appreciate all your advice, and also your time to read all this.",19Dec2019,1

**The Dog Walk**

I have recently been inspired by a number of my colleagues at work who have been very open and honest about their disabilities and long-term conditions, explaining how they affect their everyday lives and the challenges they have overcome. 

As uncomfortable as I am in praising myself and advertising my achievements, I think (and have been told by many GPs/therapists/family/friends) that it‚Äôs important to celebrate your triumphs in life ‚Äì no matter how small. What may seem like insignificant tasks are stepping stones to achieving your wider goals ‚Äì you wanted to go to the gym today, did you go? No, but you got up, you showered, you put on your gym clothes, you made it that far ‚Äì who cares if you didn‚Äôt quite make it to the gym. You can be frustrated in yourself that you never left the house, or you can appreciate that you did 90% of the work, and that‚Äôs important. 

A few months ago now I achieved something which, to most, will be nothing more than a daily task or chore but to me it was one of the most significant moments of victory for some time. I went on a dog walk. I left my boyfriend‚Äôs house and we drove about half an hour to a popular dog walking spot with the intention of walking his two beautiful Miniature Schnauzers the length of the track to Hurst Castle.

Seems like a fantastic way to spend a sunny Saturday right? Take a picnic, have a stroll, feed the angry swans that live in the pond, relax. Unfortunately for my partner, he had suggested a beautiful afternoon to who we lovingly refer to as ‚ÄòSpanish Buzz‚Äô. 

&gt;*Spanish Buzz:* for those of you who have never seen Toy Story 3, there is a scene where Buzz Lightyear gets ‚Äòreset‚Äô and he suddenly swaps to Spanish factory settings. He forgets all that he knows to be true, fearing his friends are enemies, and acting not at all like himself. This is not dissimilar to the manifestation of my anxiety, and hence why I refer to moments where my anxiety takes centre stage as the appearance of Spanish Buzz.  

Spanish Buzz (or SB for short) crops up when I least expect him but that particular weekend he was a permanent resident in place of the fun loving, bubbly girlfriend that my partner was used to. SB takes what I know to be true and flips it on its head, making me question realistic scenarios and expect unfavourable outcomes. 

SB affects my life in so many ways, but he also can have a devastating effect on the lives of the people around me. Buzz can turn any causal plan into a military operation, with a trillion Google searches for escape routes, suitable facilities, queue times, driving directions and so on. This makes days out with Buzz stressful and tedious, just the thought of spontaneity might cause him to blow a fuse and shut down for the rest of the day. Because of this people do 1 of 2 things; avoid him completely, or push him to his limits to help him see that it‚Äôs ‚Äòno big deal‚Äô. The former is upsetting and leaves me frequently lonely, whilst the latter is frustrating and has been the cause of many full-scale panic attacks. I have to choose regularly between not joining in at all or having to cope with being forced into a situation that will ‚Äúdo me some good to get out of my comfort zone‚Äù. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times my anxiety has been brushed away and disregarded when plans have been made, but if people don‚Äôt take the time to understand, they won‚Äôt know any different. 

Buzz was why I was terrified to go on our seemingly perfect dog walk. 

&gt;Just as a little bit of background, I have a number of food intolerances, culminating in some pretty terrible intestinal reactions. These symptoms, coupled with my already erratic IBS (which is just a nice way of saying, there‚Äôs something wrong with my digestive system but nobody knows what it is), can cause some fairly uncomfortable situations. But, that weekend I had avoided all of my known triggers for food intolerances and I had not eaten spicy or heavily seasoned foods (doesn‚Äôt that sound like an exciting diet!). I had no reason to fear an attack of any kind, I had not shown any IBS symptoms all day, I wasn‚Äôt bloated or crampy, I was fine. 

But Buzz had other ideas, according to him I was due for an IBS attack any minute and leaving the comfort of the 3 bathroom home I was sat in was as drastic as setting myself on fire and running through a firework shop. I was thoroughly terrified, I was sweating and pacing and couldn‚Äôt concentrate on what anyone was saying, including the repeated question from my partner about whether I wanted my coat from the cupboard. I couldn‚Äôt hear him, I couldn‚Äôt hear anything but the swirling noise of my heartbeat in my ears and eventually the sound of my own voice snapping the words ‚Äòyes‚Äô out of my mouth like a whip cracking. I felt terrible, in the heat of my panic I was rude to the person that loves me more than anything and I hated myself for it. Which only made the prospect of the dog walk even worse, I felt like I had ruined the chance for a fantastic afternoon because I had ‚Äòover-reacted‚Äô and was ‚Äòworrying for no reason‚Äô (sayings which I have heard numerous times from passers-by and those na√Øve to the genuine fear of panic attacks). 

After barking at my partner and feeling my head swell with liquid anxiety, I had to take some time by myself and swiftly took myself upstairs to sit and refocus. I fidgeted on the bed for a bit with my legs crossed and my palms on my knees until I got comfy enough to concentrate on the breathing technique I had learnt from my Mindfulness meditation app. I tried to picture us there, on the dog walk, smiling and carefree but I just kept circling back to the questions that were shouting out to be heard; ‚Äúwhat if there‚Äôs no toilet?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat if you get stuck in traffic?‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat if the car breaks down and you‚Äôre stranded there?‚Äù. I felt like screaming back at them but I concentrated really hard on the positive outcomes, and, upon hearing the feint whining of the puppies at my door, I knew I had to do it ‚Äì if not for myself, but for them. I made the snap decision to go for it, get downstairs, get my walking shoes on, grab the pups and make the most of a beautiful sunny Saturday. I still don‚Äôt really know what made me do it (and why I couldn‚Äôt do it again the following week) but I pushed Buzz to the back-seat for 5 minutes, and that‚Äôs all it took to get out of the door.

This was great until we pulled away from the house, the sight of my open-all-hours toilet getting further and further away from our accelerating car filled my head once more with all the dread I thought I had just defeated. I spent the thirty minutes of our car journey gripping the buckle of my seatbelt with my right hand and tapping out an indiscernible beat on my thigh with my fingers. Despite the encouragement from my partner and his reassurance that we could turn around at any time if needs be, I was still terrified. I regretted my earlier ‚Äòbravery‚Äô leaving the house and felt myself stupid for thinking that I could enjoy a sunlit trek across the facility-less jetty.

I got to boiling point 2 minutes from our destination, Buzz was screaming at me to demand we turn around and find somewhere for me to stop-off because I was going to have a IBS attack (I wasn‚Äôt) and the puppies were getting all excited that we were arriving at one of their favourite walks, I went so far past panic that everything went quiet and numb. I was paralysed. Trapped in a web of my own making. Sabotaged by my own brain. 

I could only just make out the murmuring of my partner telling me that we had arrived but I still sat there, motionless, staring at the dashboard, watching a bundle of lint tumble its way onto my lap. The driver door slammed, jolting me back into cognisance and forcing me to make the final decision, there was no turning back now ‚Äì stay in the car which was parked 20m from the small caf√© (which surely had a toilet, I could just buy a tea and sit there all afternoon), or get out of the car and venture up to 2 miles away from the safe welcoming arms of the ‚ÄòNeedles Eye Caf√©‚Äô. 

The excitement of the puppies had got to maximum by this point and they were jumping up and down as my partner attempted to secure them to their harnesses and fill his pockets with dog walking essentials. It was the perfect distraction, when Jasper decided to make a break for it towards some very angry looking swans, that kicked me into survival mode; there was something more important than my anxiety in that very moment and it was up to me to fix it. I went racing after him managing to grasp his lead before he leapt into the lake and tried to make friends with some cygnets, and by that time I was already a few meters from the car. 

My partner took the opportunity to lock up the car and join me, asking one last time if I was OK but not prying too much to allow me to back out. I had gotten that far. It was like going to the gym, I had got showered, I had put on my gym clothes, and now I had to leave the house. With another deep breath and a tug on the lead from the furry Harry Houdini, I took the first step across the bridge to the jetty and we were away. 

We walked for 4 miles that day, an hour and a half in the sun, running across the pebbles and throwing sticks into the water, having a genuinely fantastic time. Only twice that afternoon did I panic, Buzz crept to the forefront whilst we were at the furthest point away from the car and on the return trip when I could see the end in sight but didn‚Äôt believe I would make it. But I did it. And not only did I do it but it was a great afternoon, the most fun I had had in a long time ‚Äì all because I didn‚Äôt let Buzz get the better of me. I took a pebble from the end of the jetty that day ‚Äì a little brown misshapen one with a perfect hole through it (I had always been told as a child that this was good luck), and it sat in the pocket of my coat for months and months. I ran my fingers over it anytime I felt like I was losing myself to Buzz, and it reminded me of my triumph. It didn‚Äôt fix anything but it certainly made the little things easier to handle and I slowly began to believe in myself again, where I would spend 30mins hyping myself up to go to the shops, I would only need 20mins. Then 10mins. Then 5mins. And now‚Ä¶ none.

61,"I used to practise these things when I was in depression, no matter what but start to pretend and behave, one day you would actually start feeling those things which you used to fake. And that‚Äôs the first step of getting out of a depression by yourself but make sure YOU want to get out of depression.

Here are the things I did. I started practising this every damn day.

I try to write down my diary and track my mood. Think that:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I want to      feel okay. I want to wake up everyday with smile on my face. I want to      wake up everyday filled with a hope knowing that everything will be      alright.
2. I want to      feel lovely, I want to feel what it‚Äôs like to be someone who matters.      Someone who counts for something who will forever remain a memory.
3. I want to      feel alive. I want to feel sun‚Äôs warmth above my head and grow like a      flower that always experiences spring. I want to feel what it‚Äôs like to be      the best version of me.
4. I want to      be in love, I want a love that makes me feel free like a bird flying      towards the blue sky. I want a love that comes from me.

It works for me and I feel relaxing after writing down. It is hard to find a suitable app to write conveniently. Finally, my best friend develop one for me, named '[Stars Diary ‚Äì Journal, Mood, Note, Password](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sognarestudio.stars)'.

It really helps me, I express my feeling with music and photo and capture them in app. Release my feeling from my brain.

If these things are not helping you, never hesitate to consult a psychiatrist, not because you are crazy but because you are sick. You have just a little high fever, which you wouldn‚Äôt be able to cure yourself.",19Dec2019,1
62,"Hi everyone. I‚Äôm a 30 year old female with bipolar 1, panic, and anxiety disorder. I was finally properly diagnosed with bipolar in January. I finally feel like my meds are at a good balance, even though i have went through an extremely terrible year things are well. 

However, I have a terrible feeling that I am on the verge of a psychotic break or psychosis. Since my diagnosis I had one, at the very beginning. I have been able to name very clear Manic and Depressive phases as far back as 10-12 years. About 1 a year, closer gaps as I got older. 


I have been increasingly agitated at work (factory line hob so there are not really any variables. I do the same thing for 11 hours a day.) I am getting kind of depressed and emotional. I feel like I‚Äôm getting burned out. 
It really kind of just hit me at work tonight that this might be whats coming.

64,"This may be a bit long, so thank you to those who have opted to read!
I‚Äôm an 18 year old female that was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder today from a TMS Health Center...all within 15 minutes of meeting my doctor?..And all within him coming to that diagnosis simply from a small questionnaire?
I‚Äôm extremely confused on this. And the only time I had mentioned one of BPD‚Äôs main symptom (mood swings, anxious/overwhelming thoughts) was correlated to my birth control (which I have been off of for a week or so now) I then mentioned that I was/am feeling much better than while I was on the birth control.
I do have a history of abuse and a lot of trauma from my childhood. My mom also has a history of childhood trauma (she also exhibits symptoms of Bipolar Disorder to a great degree but refuses to get help). So I‚Äôm not sure if this was maybe genetically inherited?..
When I was younger, I did have very strong mood swings, and overall I do feel emotions very strongly but over the years I have taught myself to have a great amount of control over these emotions and have taught myself to remove or step back from situations that may provoke a strong reaction or emotional wave. 
I do have a history of self harm, as well as the fear of abandonment (My father walked out on me numerous times and I‚Äôve always been left out by my family.) 
And in the past, I have been diagnosed and treated for: PTSD, MDD and Severe Anxiety

To add more onto the diagnosis story: The doctor talked in a way as if he was assuming but wasn‚Äôt sure?.. even said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs up to you if that sounds right. But to me, it definitely seems like you have BPD.‚Äù As if he was leaving ME to decide my diagnosis? I have no idea. It all seemed too rushed and sudden for it to have been proper or professional.

So I got a therapist/psychologist. And that was it. After something he said I realized I just know I need help but still not willing to work towards it, make myself change, maybe because I don't want to fail and start over (like getting more social and failing at it).
The whole me wants someone else to do things for me, to walk for me, but I know that's impossible and failing is part of the process/life, still...


How do you make it?


I feel like taking medicine would make things easier but I don't what to depend on that. Something I'm proud of is that I never had to take medicine since I was a kid not even for a flu. 

(some background about my sessions)
- 1st therapist, 3 sessions before she took some time off: she told me she couldn't actually do things for me, which I already knew.
- 2nd therapist, only 1 session as I didn't like her: she told me I was too reticent. I didn't take that well (considering I was meeting her for the first time).
- 3rd therapist, 1 session and waiting for next week's appointment: I asked him what they expected from me (patients?) on the first appointment and answered that nothing but he had to agree with the previous therapist (I didn't mind his comment because I asked about this and also the way he said things was different). Also asked what would make him stop seeing patients and said, among other things, that it's hard to work with people who don't work on themselves but he never abandoned someone because they quit on their own first.",19Dec2019,1

69,"29m, UK. Hello! As a sufferer mental illness for years I have finally booked an appointment to see a doctor, I'm very reserved about talking about my issues, and as a new redditor I feel quite relaxed about talking about my issues when its anonymous. I am a mal2, and suffer from low moods, irritability, anger (even though I just hold it all in and stay mute), and anxiety. I worry over everything, for the last few years I have tried my best to stay somewhat stable, I exercised, I switched jobs, and I ate a better diet. Unfortunately since starting my new job my symptoms have gotten alot worse, I have always struggled to focus and always had low energy, but I feel so empty at the moment, I'm scared over everything I do and feel like this awesome new job I have is going terribly, like I'm failing and everyone knows it. I have worked in the position before in a different aspect and I know I'm good at what I do! I just cannot focus, the loud noises, I have to talk to everyone, the only way I can describe it is I'm like a dog when you pull the tennis ball out you're pocket Haha. Some days I'm really excited and positive and then within 24 hours I can be depressed and anxious and low self esteem etc. I feel good about my appointment, and I just feel like I'm not going to get the help I want or need, and I dont know what to expect. I know its alot to read, hoping for some advice. Regards, a big jabrony.",19Dec2019,1

72,"Hi.

I've had anxiety since I was a child and have been somewhat depressed for about 2-3 years, pretty much since the onset of my adulthood (I'm 20). I am, considering everything, pretty functional, I can go to work and I'm doing pretty good at uni. But I've been passively suicidal for quite some time. I just...want to die every day. From waking up to falling asleep the thought of finally just not existing anymore slips into the back of my brain and never goes away. I just go through the motions and feel either no emotions or absolute despair 90% of the time, with maybe one day of the week at most being okay. 

I'm trying to get therapy, but it's quite hard as I also have a phobia of calls that I've managed to overcome for easy stuff like making a hairdresser's appointment, but not for emotionally challinging stuff like trying to get therapy. 

In my country, talk therapy is vastly preferred, which I welcome very much since I really don't want to take meds. 

But - even after years of therapy (after I manage to finally find a therapist that will take me), will I be able to life a symptonless life? Can it go away completely? Or will I always have some existential dread? Will it always lurk underneath the surface? What have your experiences been, if you have had some form of talk therapy (especially depth psychotherapy)?

73,"About 8 years ago, my mother got a call from my father who wanted to let her know we would be moving soon. Not from one city to another but to a different country. I was happy. Very happy. So happy I forgot to acknowledge my surroundings. I was too busy dreaming about the future that I had forgotten about all I had at the present moment. The final hours I could spend in our garden. The final hours to water my favorite plants. The final hours I could spend with my grandmother. The final hours where I could say goodbye, to everyone that mattered, peacefully and patiently. 

We were to leave soon for the airport and before we did our maid visited us. Like she would every single day. She had no clue about what was happening. She just stood there until my mother called her name so she could inform her. 

While everyone was rushing to get as much things done as possible, I saw her standing with her back rested to the wall, looking and smiling at us. I thought she was happy. My mother gave her a note of 500 rupees which at first she denied to accept but my mother forced it to her and so she eventually accepted it anyway. But while she did, tears fell from her eyes. I was so confused. I thought that was a happy moment for everyone but why would she cry then? 
It felt as if she was trying to hold her tears back for a while before she actually began to cry. My mother began to comfort her while I stood there and stared still. I thought she was upset because she wanted to come with us too but she couldn‚Äôt. 

Now that I think about it, maybe she wasn‚Äôt sad because of that. But maybe because she had already visualized the scenario of never getting to see us ever again. 

Maybe with the passage of time, she had gotten attached to us. Maybe she already realized the importance of the relationship she shared with us unlike me. We did spend years together. She was more than just a maid. She was 17 and like family to us. To me. Still is. Always will be. 

Sometimes, I wonder if she still remembers me like I remember her. In her purest form, smiling at me with her back rested to the wall. Pretending to be happy.

82,"I've realized all the trauma I can remember going though as a kid and a LOT of my childhood (I'm 21) is a blank which always worried me then I got to thinking and I want to know how the hell I am not in a freaking mental hospital or heavily medicated. 
I remember my parents constantly fighting when I was really young because my dad never wanted to get up to go to work (he's better at this now) which would also start a fight over money because we were poor. 
My second older sister has always hated and even to this day she does. 
My oldest sister passed away in 2006 or 2007 at the age of 17, she was like a second mother to me and cared for myself and my younger sister. 
I had a bad break down in fourth grade which was a year after my sister passed away because in my reading class we were reading a book that talked about a kid losing his older brother who was younger than 18, I kept my cool for maybe ten minutes but I couldn't continue because I was mentally beating myself up because I didn't go to either day of my sister's funeral. 
I broke down in science class but it was silently since I never got along with my science teacher who to my young mind was always targeting me, I was called upon to read a paragraph in the science book then that's when my teacher had noticed I was crying. 
He asked why I was crying but I couldn't explain it too well since I have bad speech in the first place and when crying hard I can't be understood but the kids at my group even though they bullied me was able to understand me enough to tell my teacher that I was missing my older sister, and instead of taking me outside like every other teacher would he yelled at me to stop crying and read which I did but as soon as I was done he completely ignored me going back to sobbing my little heart out. Eventually it was time to go to English class where the student teacher noticed me and got my teacher who came out then took me up to the guidance counselor who knew what had happened to my sister as she attended the funeral herself. I ended up talking to my other older sister on the phone who was able to calm me down and I after sitting in the guidance counselor's office for a bit longer I was sent back to class but the classes changed where I went back to my home room for math but I was basically left alone for the whole class period until it was time to leave, I am 100% positive that my math/home room teacher kept an eye on me since he is friends my mom and two aunts.

I was bullied badly by my peers and one group actually made fun of me for having a Power Rangers Mystic Force watch on which I had explained that my dead sister had got it for me while at Disney for her Make-A-Wish. Even years after I was bullied until I went to my local vocational school for 10th-12th grade. 
I was bullied outside of school as well to the point where I just stayed inside.
I now have Agoraphobia and multiple other anxiety/panic disorders with trust issues, I am on two meds for every day and I have propranolol for a back up if my two meds don't keep me calm. 

I have been called a monster twice by my 9th grade which he denied and said that I was acting like a monster but my three friends in the class with me even called him out for lying. He never apologized, worst thing is I was literally the perfect student. 

My math teacher from 7th-9th grade was abusive to me as well but in 9th grade he seemed to calm down since I actually put more effort in paying attention. I am actually still afraid of him since one day a substitute opened up the small drawer where the teacher's legs would be at the desk and there was a red multitool in it. 
Last I heard anything about my old teacher is that he's proud of me for graduating high school but again I still fear him and he knows. 

During this time my parents, mainly my mom would yell at me every day before I was bullied. She kept on saying that if I would act more girly and cared about my appearance then I wouldn't be bullied, she would compare me to my three sisters then I would be sent to school crying. I had once asked her ""Why don't you love me for who I am"" which just caused her to yell then sent me to school crying. Now that I'm older I still hate her for it even though she half ass apologized but if she tried to do that shit now a days I would happily rip her a new one. 

My youngest sister went through a long phase where she was an ass and treated me like scum, she had act even made fun of my autism which to this day she will say that she was explaining to her ""friends"" that I had autism which I know is a lie because I had woken my mother up at 4 am to tell her in tears. My younger sister is better now and admits that she was an ass to me, I try to be a good older sister since the living one hates us but the younger sister hasn't fully understood that she knows but doesn't quite understand. 

I have deal with family making fun of me for still liking things like The Power Rangers and acting a bit childish but they have stopped since they found out I was diagnosed with autism, and now they actually don't care. 

Like everyone else I have had fake friends which I was able to cut out of my life and to this day I still hold myself back from beating one up. 

I deal with random anxiety or panic attacks and I end up losing all touch with reality which messes me up badly. 

I went to a special needs college where I put 100% into but I still failed the CVS pharmacy course I was taking because of two reasons. 
1: My Agoraphobia is a lot worse than what we have expected.
2: I couldn't finish the big test since my class laptop stopped working while my teacher was out and she had the key to the other laptops, my personal laptop was trash and all I could do was use MS Paint and Notepad. I couldn't use my cell phone because the website wasn't cellphone friendly and lastly the library had lent out all their laptops for the week so I couldn't get one. 
When I was sent back home since I had zero interest in any of the other courses my family didn't and still don't believe me when I say that I tried my hardest to pass which makes me pissed off because I truly did. 
At my internship at CVS which I was able to be sent home to do at one of my home city's CVS I did what I was told to do, I helped customers as best as I could but yet the main manager wrote stuff down that not even my teacher would tell me. I have since boycotted that CVS which is easy as I have one closer to me and I since I still live with my parents I got them to boycott it as well unless it's 100% necessary for them to go in.

My parents (mainly my dad) and younger sister have made fun of me over multiple things even if it's my mental health. My mom has sat there multiple times and let it happen. 

I was in therapy to help my Agoraphobia but I had to stop since my mom got a job at the local hospital and UPMC AKA real life Umbrella Corporation sucks with mental health coverage. 

I have something else but I'm not going to share because I don't want to start another argument as I'm not in the mood to deal with it, especially after writing this.

Yesterday I arrived to my parents house after not having visited in about 2 years. I usually visit every December but last year I injured my knee and was unable to travel from my home to theirs and instead went to stay by family who were much closer. The time between my last visit and now is probably what helped me see all of these things in a different light.

Last night she came home and within the first 5 minutes a verbal argument broke out between her and my father. He had asked her to get some things from the shop before she came home and she forgot to do so when she went there. He had then just said its fine and told her he'd get it tomorrow to which she started to yell at him and tell him she was busy and didn't have time (she had just come from the shop as she had taken my grandmother there). Eventually she asked me to take her ans we got what my father had asked for.

Later in the evening she had asked when I would be finishing my masters. I said it wasn't up to me and I didn't know. For some background, I had submitted my entire thesis to my thesis supervisor in June 2019 and he only started to provide feedback to me in November after I had complained to my head of department a month prior. My final submission deadline is in January and as it stands I will most likely not be able to submit then due to his inability to provide timeous feedback. I was supposed to submit my final thesis in December 2019. I had told my mother all of this earlier in the evening. After I said I did not know she freaked out and yelled at me saying she was just taking an interest and then she wouldn't ask again about my life because I don't care to share.

During the braai (basically a barbecue) she had told a story of how much she hated a woman at work. She said from the moment the woman was hired she hated her. They have apparently not seen eye to eye most of it seems to be from my mother. This part isn't first hand information but what she relayed to us while dinner was being prepared. She didn't like how this new woman said hello, or worked or tried to engage with her at work. She got livid with anger at even the thought of her. My mother has even gotten a written warning for threatening the woman. During this discussion my aunt had asked her why she didn't stay on her antidepressants and had managed to convince her to go back on them. 

Before we ate she had asked of we wanted to go eat at a seafood restaurant. I declined politely because I do not eat seafood nor do I like the smell. Its quite strong and make me feel sick. She was upset with this and was once again mad at me.

Later on when we came to sit down to eat in the lohnge she asked me if I wanted to watch something. I declined and said ""no, I don't want to watch anything right now"". Again she freaked out and yelled at me. I honestly don't even remember what it was I just blocked it out and started to eat. While we were eating she told my dad to look for something to watch. He tried to find what she wanted to watch but couldn't since it seems it was recently removed from the streaming service. Additionally their Internet was quite slow last night due to the additional devices from the family that are visiting. The entire dinner she berated my father calling him retarded, stupid for a smart man, tarty and an idiot. He eventually left looking for a show and then just carried on eating.

This is not new behaviour but it's been quite jarring since this is the first time I've been able to visit in a long time. My mother has had a long history of acting this way when I was younger. She has previsoly hit me for answering very inane questions in a way she didn't like at the time. She has also called me whore, uncouth etc. On many occasions throughout my childhood and into my teen years. 

It has only recently become apparent that this isn't just her being over emotional or just reactive to situations. It seems like there might be an undiagnosed disorder but I do not know how to approach getting her help without upsetting her. I have discussed these concerns with another family member that my mother seems to respond well to.

How can I get her some assistance such as a psychiatrist initially to help treat her depression and look and the deeper issue that are causing her to act this way?",19Dec2019,1

But for a quick recap, I'm a male in my early 20's. I have childhood trauma due to negligence from my father and some other factors. 

I am know facing huge debt, which I have a deadline for. I am currently unemployed. I am searching for a job. But here's the thing. Earlier this month I started working at a very good company. Few hours pass on my very first day there and I went full blown mental breakdown. I talked with my manager and quitted the job the same day...

At this point I dont know what to do. My mental issues are making things impossible for me. Therapy is expensive. Reading books do not help me. Abusing substances is not helping me. Support is almost non existent in my close circle. What can I do at this point? I am cornered by all sides and I feel very trapped.

86,"So this is a more updated version of the post (you will probably find the original version somewhere in my profile history) so you will find most of the same as the last post plus a few additions because the more I learn more about this subject, the more I feel obligated to point this out

So there is the post

______________________________________________


I want to point out before hand that this is a personal opinion so take it with a pinch of salt

And yes, I am very aware of the seriousness of mental illness. I have struggled with mental illnesses all my life and I studied psychology so I am pretty aware why mental illness is such a big issue to tackle and why it should be tackled more in the forefront due to that it was shunned for a long time. And I know that there are still remnants of a mentality where people have the wrong impression or are given the wrong impression about what mental illness is and how it affects people (namely - news organisations who still to this day want to paint mental illness as the sole factor behind violence, mass shootings and every other crime imaginable while the reality is much more complicated)

I know that lately, mental illness is getting a lot of awareness which I do think that this is a good thing. 

But at the same time, I am noticing a pattern that instead of trying to make people aware that people with mental illness are still people regardless of their struggles, I feel like that there is a pattern where mental illness is being romanticized. 

For example, I have heard this phrase countless times ""this guy (ex: Einstein) was pretty smart. He must have been autistic"".

Ok fine, maybe he was but what does that have to do with anything? Do you have to be autistic to be smart or gifted? Why should all of their habits, traits and behaviours be related to their mental disorders or whatever kind of mental quirk that they have? 

(Eg - an autistic person does something weird - is it because he is weird or is it because he is in a mood where he does not care or he is that daring? Same thing goes for the categorisation of other people in the opposite end like disabled people are often depicted as people of inspiration which pressures them to stand out more or else that they will get a lot of pity from others. If a disabled person does something, is it becuase this is just an act of doing or is it becuase of something deeper like growing out of that disability. But why should their disability be the only thing that defines them?)

Does this mean that those without mental illness or those who managed to handle their mental illness are not gifted or special?

I have heard and seen this type of romanticized model of mental illness countless times where people who were smart or had an influence on the world in some way had mental illness, or fictional characters in films or TV who are influential or legendary have mental illness. 

Or it does not necessarily need to be a mental illness but rather a quirk that the person has like social awkwardness like the stereotype goes that people who are socially awkward are more like to be intelligent or have a particular exceptional skill in something. Okay, maybe that is the case (or not) but why go so far to paint this person from an overly positive image when you can also point out the necessity of overcoming the obstacle of social awkwardness as it may lead to other problems in the long run such as difficulty in developing/advancing in one's career, developing meaningful relationships or even loneliness?

Why should mental illness be the enveloping factor that makes this person who he is or why this person is gifted the way he or she is? What about passion, upbringing, hard work, maybe even luck? Or what about mental struggles that do not necessarily involve mental illness like for example there is a black character in a film that just happens to be black, or a gay character who is gay. Ok what else? What are their passions, their flaws, the dreams and desires? Surely there is more to a person, good and bad, other than just being ""the gay character"" or the ""the black character"". 

Sometimes I feel that all of this ""pro-progressive"" mentality is all done for the sake of looking good and empathetic and you often find this a lot of media that are associated with reality like the X-factor or some reality show (why do you think that they like to put on-screen who have a rough background and the people with the most baggage are most likely to advance in the next stage of the competition? It is probably sensationalism to look empathetic and hopeful, making people more likely to have screen time for their background and not for their talent/skill because otherwise, if the latter was chosen over the former, then it would be seen as cruel or unfair)

Why should my mental illness also paradoxically define me who I am or what I am capable of doing? 

Dont get me wrong, I do understand this. Even my mental disorders are useful to me in some ways - my depression sometimes makes me more aware of certain things - dark things but still, it is good to be aware of them (unless the depression takes over and reinforces my apathy), sometimes my anxiety goads me to act or be prepared for anything (yes, anxiety can be a nightmare and maybe the fears are not even real but that is why there is the mindfulness training to be aware of it and handling it well).

But why should my mental disorders be the defining factors of why I am capable of doing these things or who I am like Van Gogh or possibly Einstein or Newton?

This sounds very paradoxical and almost too similar to same way of how mental illnesses used to view as by outsiders - being the only factor that defines the person regardless of all the other qualities that this person has


I am fed up of this becuase it is unrealistic and even harmful portrayal of mental illness. 

I feel like that this pattern of trying to portray the good side of mental illness or at least the beneficial side effects of what mental illness can bring overshadows and neglects the bad side of it. 

Sometimes I find all of this sugar-coated version of awareness all too cheesy - awareness for this, awareness for that, repeatedly and repeatedly to the point where I feel that it is not getting anywhere or lacks the powerful impact that it should be provoking (and this also raises a huge question- if there is so much awareness about any things lately, why is this awareness campagin still going? Is it becuase all of these talks and ads and influencers are not influential enough to cause a change or at least a tiny bit of adjustment in the minds of at least a few people even though I know that changing the mentalities of entire populations could take years or even generations?)

(Or sometimes, dare I say it - I sometimes find this too politically correct - so what the Joker is a person who has mental illness. Sure, the portrayal is very shocking, scary and possibly inaccurate (same way that a few other forms of art did in the past) but there is a message behind this of improper treatment can affect people in the long-run especially to those who are more vulnerable. Or another example that comes to mind is when you are asked to call a person ""diagnosed with autism"" instead of the word ""autistic"". Sure, the latter puts more of a label on that person but if you also suddenly want to change the former as well with the phrase ""exhibiting symptoms of autism"", I fail to see how this makes a difference on putting a label on that person anyway because you say or do not say, you will still put a label on that person/thing, whether good, bad or neutral (note - the problem is not the problem, the problem is your attitude towards the problem)

Fine, maybe my anxiety sometimes helps me to be prepared or to act accordingly but I am not going to lie that it makes me feel frozen, petrified and frightened most of the time. 

And I say the same way for many other mental illnesses out there. Sure they can be helpful or one can accept them in their lives if this method is utilised well but that does not mean that they dont have those bad days anymore or that the mental illness (or whatever kind of mental struggle) does not get to them personally. 


My gut is telling me that I am seeing a lot of this is due to cheesy marketing - it looks good, it looks progressive, it looks hopeful, it sells especially for those who are not familiar with the phenomenon, whether if they did not study it or whether they did not experience it themselves. 


I am not saying that there is no hope at all whenever someone is struggling through mental illness (or could be any kind of mental struggle because it does not necessarily have to involve a diagnosable mental illness) and I am not saying that mental illnesses should not be treated (becuase aside from even the debate of what boils down to what a mental illness is or how it should be treated (there were a few insights that made us aware of how we view mental illness like Thomas Zsasz's criticism of the phenomenon of mental illness and the Rosenhan experiment).

Treatment for mental illness vary a lot depending on many things - the mental struggles themselves (similar to how a wound can be treated), the person and his/her goals, the person who treating him/her (in therapy, your personality will come into contact with the client so there will some sort of chemistry there or none at all), the philosophy behind the treatment, how difficult it is, the origins and diagnosis of the mental struggle and how to prevent reinforcing it and so on


But I hate how amongst all of this chaos and hardship of mental illness is often romanticized version of a burden that overshadows the weight and struggles behind that burden. Or portraying mental disorders is the sole reason why the person is capable of doing A (like a person who happens to have Aspergers. Yes, people with Aspergers tend to be highly intelligent or highly interested in a particular subject but it is not the same for every one of them) becuase paradoxically, it envelopes the person makes it as the defining feature of why the person does what he does. It is as if you are replacing one label with another except this time, it has a different colour.

(Like I said earlier, yes, mental disorders can have their own perks if you look hard enough. But every person has many others too - dreams, desires, other flaws or patterns that do not have to involve mental disorders, the capacity to work hard and be diligent amongst all the struggles, the capacity of love, to think, to dream and so much more)

I find this romanticized effort as just as stigmatising as portraying mental illness from the opposite end of the phenomenon and gives the wrong and untruthful message to those who are unfamiliar with this phenomenon especially considering that this is an issue that is unbelievably complicated if you dig deep into it. 

Yes, people need to be aware of the damaging effects of mental illness and maybe mental illness and/or any mental struggle of any kind is not entirely bad or detrimental to the person but if you keep on shielding people with these bizarrely overly optimistic messages about mental illness or mental struggles in general, then you risking damaging their perception of the reality of this subject and will not give them the right tools on how to approach.

And because of this, I feel that this is type of portrayal of mental disorders lack of the substance that is necessary to give the following messages to those who are watching the messages:

- Mental disorders are just as real and a heavy burden than any other form of illness

- Apart that they are just as real as any other type of illness, mental disorders are also incredibly complicated and have so many different factors involved, biological, psychological and social

- Not every human problem can be boiled down to a mental illnesses - they are incredibly tricky to diagnose, treat and handle. Sometimes humans can be just as vulnerable without putting a label at something.

- Yes, mental disorders are terrifying and heavy to carry but there is the good as well in that phenomenon

- Yes, mental disorders can strangely have their own benefits and perks if handled and utilised correctly but they also carry so much weight and struggles

- The reality of the human mind and the capabilities of what the human mind can do and/or be, both incredible and horrible, are just as complicated and puzzling as every other subject. And not every person's stories and troubles are the same even if they carry the same amount of weight or exhibit the same amount of symptoms or come from the same backgrounds",19Dec2019,1

An example is given a bottle of alcohol I will attempt to out drink others, pills in prescription are at least quad doses from recommendation as I fully understand the consequences of doing so. However it seems my mind does not want to stop and this usually ends with a blackout. The upside is I do have enough will to not attempt anything too hard in terms of narcotics.

88,"Well let's give a little background to the history, my personality is shattered into pieces, and one of those pieces is really violent, even tried to kill my mom multiple times. Me and ""the others"" are scared of her, i mean, that part. And when it takes over it just TAKES OVER completely. I'm scared that it kills something or someone, since it haves stabbed tables and stuff, and choked mom, and hurt her multiple times, it always thinks about killing or making damage and bad to others. I'm scared because i love my mom and my partner and i don't want to damage them, but either i want to be isolated just because it can appear if i'm provoked. 

I have to say that i already go to therapy, i always go to my psychiatrist and i always take my medication (i take a lot). It helped a little but still, when it comes over, no one can control it.

I tried my best to speak correctly so you understand cause i even gave her a name and i know how she looks like in my head, but saying ""it"" makes people understand better, i think. Just my partner knows about how i have multiple personalities and he saw almost all of them, my family saw all of them but doesn't believe i have anything more than anxiety and think i'm ""making up"" stuff because i read a lot.

I really don't wanna hurt anybody and i don't want to have those things on my head anymore, other personalities are fine, but not that one.

(Here‚Äôs the Long winded back-story, feel free to scroll to the **** below for main question)

I‚Äôve suffered from depression my whole life, but was misunderstood for it as a child/teen (you should be grateful for what you have, you‚Äôre killing the atmosphere, it‚Äôs an ‚Äúemo phase‚Äù, etc etc). 
I worked several jobs alongside school and managed to graduate university a few years ago despite missing many lectures from barely being able to get out of bed. I moved from job to job, not really finding a passion but just paying rent.
I have a wonderful partner who is so supportive. YET I still fantasise about dying every day.
I‚Äôm now unable to hold down a job (too many sick days, poor performance etc) and have had a year out of work (funded from my own savings that I had previously intended to buy a house with). I told myself seriously I would give myself 12 months of REALLY trying everything before giving up, so that my partner and family would be able to say ‚Äúshe genuinely tried everything before taking her own life‚Äù. 
I.e- I‚Äôve been open about my mental health with everyone, stopped drinking, eat very healthily and exercise daily. I practice mindfulness, gratitude and meditation. I attend therapy and take medication regularly to the advice of my psychiatrist. But after 11 months, I really do not see a difference. 
As I write this, I‚Äôm holed up in a room with nothing to do and nowhere to go. I‚Äôve tried volunteering and donating, but struggle to attend every volunteer session. BUT I‚Äôve made sure my house will be super easy to clean out when/ if I‚Äôm no longer here.

I‚Äôm literally a sad vegetable. In a coma, but fully awake.

****

Now, my partner says taking my own life would be extremely selfish and would inflict pain on others. My family have visited once in 11 months (they live 2 hours away) and say the exact same- I should absolutely keep fighting to stay. Every day of my existence is painful and I‚Äôm not able to contribute to society, I‚Äôm causing my family / partner pain everyday as they worry about me. 
They ask me to stay alive, so that they don‚Äôt suffer grief. If my problems were physical, I‚Äôd be allowed to argue the ‚Äúpoor quality of life‚Äù card. But no, a mental health issue is different.
I‚Äôm so grateful for my partner‚Äôs efforts and sweet family but I sometimes get (silently) frustrated when they say ‚ÄúIf I could take the pain away I would‚Äù - it‚Äôs meant with such pure intentions but it‚Äôs empty- yes please take the pain away, go through the month of grief so that I don‚Äôt live another 50 years in pain.

CW: suicidal fantasies

Hello everyone.

I am an Australian male college student, 20 years of age. I have a low (about 2.3 on a scale of 4 or a 4.025 on a scale of 7) GPA after 3 semesters as I am not good with tests as a commenter in an earlier thread of mine has pointed out. 

Despite this, I always wanted to work on space projects since about 10-12 years of age, and as Australia‚Äôs space industry is still in its infancy, I would have to move to another country such as the US (which would require a postgraduate degree for an EB-2 visa). As my GPA is too low for a postgraduate degree, I quite often fantasise about committing suicide in public in order to strengthen funding in the Australian space industry. 

Other commenters in some of my previous posts say that it‚Äôs a bad idea and it‚Äôs better to foster investment by either hopping aboard a local startup or making my own startup in the field.

100,"I started going to therapy in February 2018. I was in a CBT program. (Not in therapy anymore though.)

Anyway, one thing that we talked about was breathing techniques. (I know some popular ones are like ""Breathe in for 4, Hold for 7, Exhale for 5"" or something along those lines. My therapist had me try one out, but it only brought more anxiety onto me. (That technique is similar to what instrumentalist use to play their instruments. Basically it's just deep breathing.) So I had to switch to a different method. (Currently I use ""Take a deep breath, hold for 5, exhale."")

So, when we were talking about this, my therapist told me to use these breathing techniques more than just when your anxious. (Like even when you wake up/go to bed.) This way your brain won't associate breathing techniques with anxiety, like the first technique had. It's been over a year and that breathing technique still works for me.",19Dec2019,1

To have such descriptive illustration with all the senses so intact, cohesive- working in harmony, illustrated outwardly, so well in the story is very impressive,(considering she does very poorly at practicing this in reality)but‚Ä¶ to be able to convey thought and emotion well, means well‚Ä¶ I believe, even if it has ‚Äúyet‚Äù to fully mature, the process has begun.

To be able to articulate like this at such a young age is astonishing to me, esp. with her disposition. But what do I know, I‚Äôm an idiot ‚Äòbout‚Ä¶ pretty much everything.

She asked for help with editing, wants to publish it‚Ä¶ imagine that!

She said; ‚Äúwould you post it on your blog?‚Äù‚Ä¶.. I‚Äôm thinking wow!‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthere it is. Yes of course! Lets channel this energy and power my little super nova.

Clo‚Äô has a very powerful inner-vocation and I think somehow, perhaps writing may do for her what it has done for me all my life, brought me peace of mind and clarity, my best friend at times‚Ä¶my land-line to God, and a trail of bread crumbs, so as never to get lost in the enchanted forest.

Again‚Ä¶ its the little shit that makes the biggest difference. Our kids are always watching us, listening to us‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääunbeknownst to us‚Ä¶ imprinting.

We are not just raising‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääone generation of kid‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhen we bring a child into this world, we are raising parallel future generations in the moment, tangent to the now. This is how we break and make cycles for a better future for all the children, for all mankind.

The mind‚Äô wax tablet.

Clear, soft, impressionable when first-formed‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit discloses itself to itself, the Id being examined by the Odd‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcreating tension.

Tension constitutes growth, makes the wax soft-r‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämaking permanent impressions to live by.

This is how small-positive changes‚Ä¶ of awareness, change the world in a very big way. It always begins with us ‚Äòtho‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt it? Are we present enough?

I was given the gift to write like my mother, perhaps Clo‚Äô gift will do the same for her children some day‚Ä¶  after her successful education, after graduating from a University wielding a PHD, she will look back and see how her writing truly made a difference, made her life possible. Life is story‚Ä¶from the beginning to end, we write it.

I believe she has every equal-right to achieve all the best this world can afford her, to be well, to live well. I believe this to be obtainable, I believe it can, and will happen for anybody that can hold true to their dream.

This world affords us all the same. We chose what to do with it.

105,"'m alone. I know that people say you always have family, but the truth is even familial relationships are fragile. You have people, until you don't. We come into this world alone, and we die alone and that has always terrified me, so I dealt with it by surrounding myself with right knit relationships.

 I've always been the kind of person to have a few really close friends instead of a ton of semi close friends but these days even those are dwindling. I got into a pretty prestegious college where I live, but my boyfriend wants to go to it's rival and truthfully I was thinking about it as well. I want to be a dual major, and each college is better at one than the other so it doesn't really matter where I go but It's stressing me out. I'm worried I'm the kind of person that life chews up and spit out.

 I feel dislocated and disconnected from everyone in my life. Even my boyfriend of almost 2 years feels really distant and I'm unsure (but not that unsure) if it's just me or things really are expanding in opposite directions. I know that everything in my life is about to change in the next 3 months and it feels like the rug is being pulled out from underneath me. So that's me. Alone, confused and a little chewed up.

And I care too much. I care about everything and everyone at my own expense until I break to the point where it makes people in my life upset with me because I disregard my own needs for others. I mean hell, I'm completely willing to go to a different college for a boy (who I love) but a boy no less. 

And I worry. I worry about things entirely out of my control until I can't breathe. I let my existentialism put me to tears when no one else is around. The truth is I know I'm capable of having the strength to ignore those creeping scary thoughts about loneliness and the march of time and the inevitability of death but I just don't. It's really hard and most people have religion to assuage those fears, or people like my mother find it idiotic to be afraid of what you can't control but I just can't help it. I'm just afraid and life demolishes those who are afraid. It doesn't help that I have manic tendencies and suffer from PTSD but I can usually compartmentalize that and take care of my day. It's the worrying that kills me.

I just feel. Distant. Like disconnected or like I'm not really here and someone else is piloting my body while my mind occupies some other space.

Sorry if that's kind of a jumbled mess, I'm not in the best headspace to articulate at the moment.

Also sorry to anyone who commented on my original post, I posted it in the wrong sub and a mod took it down. And I apologize for the formatting, I'm on mobile.",19Dec2019,1
107,"I‚Äôve been going to my therapist for about 3ish months now. My therapist is super nice and always walks me out to greet his next patient.

For the past few weeks, I noticed that he would always have the same client after me (which is to be expected). It wasn‚Äôt until yesterday that I noticed how pissed she looked. She looked pissed, AT ME. 

The first time I noticed her, she looked annoyed. And more annoyed each week. But yesterday when I came out of my session, she like, locked eyes with me and gave me the nastiest look. 

I will say that the last three weeks, my session (one hour) would run about 5 minutes over. One time was because my therapist couldn‚Äôt start until 5 after and wanted to give me the full time. The other two times have been because I‚Äôve been really stressed out.

I don't understand parental love, or unconditional love, or love in general. I don't understand families, the desire for children, and ""blood is thicker than water."" I don't understand why people like holidays. I don't understand small talk. I don't understand expected respect. I don't understand monogamy and why it's a default or why a partner that wants to experience other people is that big of a deal.

I'm just confused all the time about peoples motives and actions and I'm sick of going against my gut when making decisions because that's not how I'm supposed to act.

114,"Therapy echoed the most insidious part of abuse back to me - the self doubt, the constant questioning of your emotions, the constant drive to be rational - and called it ""cognitive distortions.""    It told me if I'd just dive deep enough into that toxic mess, doubt and question myself even harder than I already was, then I'd heal.  That was the only way.

Therapy dismissed my pain and fear and shamed me for even expressing them.  When I tried to talk about it I'd just get told that therapy is hard and I can't expect the therapist to do all the work for me.  If I pushed I'd get told well maybe I just wasn't ready to change, or therapy wouldn't work if I wasn't willing to go through the difficult parts.  I could be in the worst emotional pain of my life and it would not be enough.  

Therapy gleefully supported an abusive parent, simply because she was sane and I was not.  Most likely her abuse was the start of the problems.  But therapy made damn sure I knew that I deserved every bit of it.  Maybe they didn't put it in so many words - but they reiterated her logic and made sure I knew it was my anxiety causing me to think that way.  After all it wasn't *rational* to think that a parent who so obviously wanted a relationship and did so many nice things for me could be abusive.

And at the end, when I couldn't keep up, therapy blamed me for not wanting to get better.  I wasn't willing to do the hard work, wasn't putting in the effort.  And the only reason I didn't recover was I wasn't willing to stick with it.  It was completely forbidden to question whether the therapy process was working, after all.  And if I didn't get results it must be because I wasn't trying hard enough.

This was not one therapist.  I have seen, all told, over a dozen mental health professionals.  9 therapists in multiple different states, as well as psychiatrists and psychologists.  And this behavior was completely consistent among all of them.

Now, a little context: I always did everything to her. I used to buy her chocolate, I would go see her even when I was totally exausted from work (I work 60+ hours/week), this kind of stuff. She rarely did this kind of thing for me, and even when she did, she would use it as a excuse to not do it again for weeks. So naturally, when we broke up, I was way more devastated than her.

The point is, even after 3 months, I can't take her out of my head. I've tried everything: To go out with other girls, tried to hate her for what she did, but every time I see her I can't handle it, it's just too much.

119,"I'm a current international medical student, in my 3rd year, here in a Ukraine far away from home, and I've been having panic attacks since my mental breakdown at my entrance exam preparation.

My childhood hasn't been great. Life's been tough. My parents, they have had a troubled marriage, and their starting years left me with mental scars which might perhaps take years to heal.

To run away from the physical and mental abuse at home, and at the hands of my relatives who were against my parents relationship and who considered me a result of an illegitimate relationship, treated me like I was less than a human, I was always on the run for things which helped escape the dreadful reality I had at hand, and science, honestly filled my heart with Love and joy.

I never knew what a stable relationship was. I had to console my mum right by the moment I gained the ability to talk. Filling in my dads presence by devoting myself emotionally to my mum, I stayed emotionally drained, most of times, to even go out and explore any human contact.

I starting to go and work out things I love: tinkering around toys, then machines, trying to design things, making new machines, I felt the joy of being able to imagine. Those were one of the best moments of my life.

Every other day, when they couldn't bother to use their mouth to speak of things clearly, they'd make a way out in physically causing me pain, thinking that would make me understand things they couldn't perhaps speak of.

They'd hit me with anything they'd find, and by the time I was able to go to school, I was so scared of being physically assaulted that I was an easy target for bullies, getting repeatedly bullied at both home and school, the trauma that period caused me, combined with no sense of belonging, being regularly told by my parents that I was the reason their life were so fucked, made me gone more into this protective shell where I'd shut down

There was an instance when student smashed my head against the bench, pressed it, and stood there, until the teacher came. And the worst part of this is, I didn't cry. And the teacher punished both of us.

My dad always made it clear that I wasn't the son he wanted, in his actions and words, he'd prefer my cousin over me, and when I was too afraid to go on a ride at an amusement park, he grabbed my hand, forcibly took hold of me, and rushed back to home.

He'd make me feel I wasn't what he wanted, I was more feminine in my actions. And thereby, the word he'd use to taunt me and call me out, was, as you'd expect ""gay"". I never knew why he did that, perhaps, he felt homosexuality was a disgrace.

My mum was emotionally very unstable, one moment hitting me until she was tired, and other second calling me in and telling me that it was my fault, that she hit me.

And this kept happening, until my other siblings were born, 7 years.

And then, things go worse. Well. I could never say my parents ever loved me. Maybe we both have different definitions of love. They think it's controlling something to the point where it becomes your personal stress buster, which, when you hit, should come back to you with words of love and affection, and that isn't something I really agree with.

Perhaps, it was just my past and I should leave it there.

However, my mind, on an physiological level, is getting triggering by this, and other factors, sometimes random, unless expressed properly, which led me into these high intensity panic attacks, which suck the life out of me. I have flashbacks, and it seems life is being sucked out of me. My blood pressure increases tremendously, my pulse rises, I can feel my heart beating against my chest so fast that it aches. My hands turn cold, and I, in a deep state of pain and sorrow, try to rush from the spot, to a place of refuge.

However, most of these attempts are futile, as I fall unconsciously, breathless, with hypoxia, a kinda of semiparalysis, a state of life which usually makes me conclude that death is better than life.

And with it comes the social awkwardness.

I was really happy to be out here, away from my family finally, in a new place, as a new start, without any bondages, except one, of the tuition fees they paid. But alas, my dreams were crushed that night, when I was having a dinner with my friends. I was texting my then girlfriend, and my relationship with her was at a breaking point, and suddenly, my mind gets all filled up with these series of thoughts, unknown memories of traumas of my past, me being breathless, and falling into the lap of a friend, at the dinning table, who then carefully took me back to my room, making it seem that I was okay.

That was the day that changed my life entirely.

I tried talking about this to my parents. They deflected, rejected, disdained, and disowned all and every of my accusation, gaslighting every path of story which I had live through, comparing my understanding with that of an ungrateful brat, who was just acting around the whole time, as one professor dubbed me ""an attentionseeker"". I felt I was dying. Come on.

I went back to my country, had myself checked in at this shithead of a doctor, who somehow managed to make the situation worse, making my parents believe that I was just having general anxiety, with an overly exhausting predicting of my future, which, said, was not a good one to invest, and this was based on a 3 minute talk I had with him in absence of my parents. Basically, he diagnosed me with being an ""asshole"".

Wow. Seriously. Thanks doc. I hope you find happiness when you have dinner at night, surrounded by the knowledge that you purposely, made my already fumed situation, even worse.

They concluded they wouldn't send me back to the college.

For weeks, they had me in front of them, 14 hours a day, where they'd say something, followed by, ""why doesn't this trigger you?"" and ""why don't you do your panic attack thing now?""

However, luckily they went in for a second opinion. This time, the doc who initially said she'd talk to me for half an hour, took 6 hours out of her time, and called on the previous doc as a fraud.

However, I was given neither a proper treatment, nor medication to deal with myself. This was two years ago.

I was send back in here, and I kept suffering, until the point where I actively started avoiding everything which triggered me.

Three months back, I realised that my life was reduced to nothing. I didn't do a thing I loved. And if I tried, I'd have a panic attack, and it'd fuck me for the next few months until I actively refrain from triggers. I couldn't study, do my projects, read about things I love, paint, write my novels, maintain basic hygiene, couldn't sit through a movie without getting in a depressed state.

And two months from now, I had a relapse. After being clean for an year. I had a relapse.

I was devastated. I wanted to kill myself.

I spend a week alone. Not sleeping, not eating food, not doing anything, just trying not to have a panic attack.

When I went to class the next week, a teacher told me that ""this is your problem. And if you ever present this diagnosis(which said I was suffering from ptsd) anywhere in this university, I'll make sure your name lands in the expel list""

I didn't speak a word for the next couple of hours.

Next day, this other teacher saw me being inattentive at class, and asked me to meet her after class.

When I got there, she asked me everything, and listened, and gave me contacts for a psychologist friend of hers.

I hadn't had slept for more than 4 hours on average everyday for a month, by the time this happened.

But I didn't know how to get this done, I didn't have the money to pay the doctor, my parents concluded a long time ago that I was okay, and when I confronted them, they said they ""don't believe in mental illness"".

By the end of day, I got home, and found something that changed this entire thing upside down

There was a junior student, who had heard of me, and wanted me to tutor him, and said he'd pay me well.

And thankfully, I got to the doctor, she helped me a lot, and set me a therapy, for the next seven months.

I'm about to start my second month. I've been sleeping better. My panic attacks are still really too much to deal with, but the intensity is slightly lesser, and at least I know this can get better.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really love my parents. They're trying their best at... well... being parents i guess. I have a lot stronger emotional connection to, for example, friends, than to them. They have never been very open, so I was brought up in an enviroment which doesn't really promote being open. Now, after a few years studying in a different city, I changed a bit. I'm more open... but not to them. They are maybe the last people I'd ask for help if I had serious problems. When they see me sad, they are literally \*forcing me\* to open up. And all the time they tell me that I can trust them. But I don't. And I don't even see any reason to try to change that. Is there something wrong with me? If there is, what exactly?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm kinda sensitive. It's all the small things. Friend refuses to sit next to me during a lecture? Yeah, I wonder what's so repulsive in me. A different friend hugs all people goodbye and I get only a high-five? Yeah, I wonder why I don't deserve that. Very often these days I find myself in this pathetic mood thinking what's wrong with me, what should I change in me, why I'm not enough. One little thing can literally turn my day 180 degress and change a ""pretty nice weather, huh?"" into ""leave me alone, I want to cry while repetitively listening to those three sad songs I have on my phone"". Of course, everytime I think about it, I find a lot of things that are wrong with me. Yet I have zero motivation to do anything.

I feel like a third wheel very often. Even when it's 100% obvious I'm not... I still DO feel like one. I think it's so severe, I would even prefer to talk with a not-so-close friend (1 on 1) than with both my best friends at once. I feel, that they don't want me there. And even when they say they do... my mind doesn't seem to accept it. Is there a name for that?

Sometimes, when I wake up, I don't feel like doing anything. I don't see any value in long-term goals. I feel like I have nothing to do (even when I have to do a lot of stuff).

I went one time in 3rd grade, and gave up, I wouldn‚Äôt even say I really went freshman year of high school my friend took me to go hang out with hers, so it wasn‚Äôt really that productive. Then I went twice this year but ended up giving up because I don‚Äôt really feel comfortable at all talking to adults and having to re-explain my entire life to a new person every time I want to switch when I don‚Äôt feel comfortable doing it in the first place.

Anyway, so I‚Äôve been speaking to my friend that I made this year in college, and she really opened my eyes and had been encouraging me to go and try again, and like I said, I‚Äôm big on complaining and not doing, so I‚Äôm going to try really hard this year to work on my mental health and take it seriously.

Not that I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs serious now, but I‚Äôm ready to put it out in the world and actually get help. It‚Äôs scary and I‚Äôm getting anxious just typing this, but I‚Äôm really ready and I want to now.

127,"I used to suffer quite badly from intrusive thoughts and i've managed to overcome a lot of it now. I used to see something that was gross or scary and not be able to stop thinking about it, it would pop into my head everyday and it would become an obession. 

I thought I was done with this issue until recently I had this thought, picturing myself sexually attracted to something which  I am not, and now I can't stop thinking about it to the point where when I see that thing I can't tell if i'm imagining being attracted to it or I actually am attracted to it.

 I'm scared these thoughts reflect who I actually am or I'm turning into them. I dont want to associate these things with arousal and actually become attracted to them because I feel this may be happening on a very small scale. Everything is a blur and I cant work out what is an intrusive thought and what is my actual feelings.

132,"Tl;Dr what does an appropriate relationship with alcohol and exercise look like? I'm a woman looking for healthy resources to help me get established in life.

Throwaway account. I grew up with an emotionally abusive parent who violated her custody agreement, but was never prosecuted. Every night we would eat dinner in front of the TV in silence, and she would start drinking and pass out on the couch asleep. I never saw her exercise, and she was obese and always angry.

These days I find myself in a stressful situation trying to advance my career. When I perform through a deadline, I tend to reward myself with a weekend of at-home drinking and some kind of binge eating-- but to my short stature that means, say, 700 calories of Cherry Garcia (1serving). I'm smart and competent-- I'm afraid this may just mean high-functioning--  and unfortunately I remember what I want, and every day I delay this gratification it becomes twice, thrice, as worse until I eventually give in. I never forget a craving. Recently I've even drunk two drinks in the day, at my job, as a reward and this scares me.

All my life all I've seen in family relationships is stress. I know it gets harder when you have kids. I'm afraid of my relationship to food and alcohol. I'm looking for a way to establish healthy routines, what people tell themselves to stop them from eating high calorie sweets. When they drink and how often. What they tell themselves to exercise. If you have any suggestions I would love it if you could let me know, so that I can find healthier means to reward myself/relax.",19Dec2019,1

136,"&amp;#x200B;

Even though this guy lives close to my area we basically only talk using discord, occasionally we meet at parties and stuff. To be honest I don't feel very close to him, even though I get the impression that he feels quite close to me. I only got to meet him over a friend that had a friend who knew the guy I'm talking about due to having school together with him. Still we play some games together sometimes but other than that I am not feeling that comfortable talking to him, I feel like our personalities aren't fitting. This sounds rough but I would say that I'm not really ""interested"" in him, whereas he is definitely interested in me.

Another part of me not feeling comfortable spending all too much time with him is that he's gay or bisexual, at least that's what I believe since I never asked him and he never directly stated it to me, whereas I'm straight, so I'm not interested and always feeling very awkward. I believe he's dropping many hints of beeing interested in me?, can't really say it for sure though since I never really had a relationship so I don't know if he's being serious or not. Well, I basically always laugh it off and just continue enjoying playing the game with him. However I always have this bad feeling afterwards since I know he's suicidal (saw a reddit post he made and he often says stuff like ""I might not be living then anymore..."") and my reaction on his attempts? might just make his situation worse, crossing the line and then resulting in him comitting suicide for real. In that reddit post I also read that he's basically not living for himself, he's just living so others close to him wouldn't get hurt.

Nonetheless I still don't want to ignore his condition, even though I'm not really comfortable talking to him. I know many of his friends who might also have these thoughts I have but also don't try to change anything about his situation (pretty much the reason I made this post so he might finally get some support). This will sound harsh again but I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't be depressed over him killing himself, I might think about it occasionally and regret my decision of not helping him but it wouldn't hit me all that hard. Nevertheless I still think it's not fair to not try to help him and just ""let him die"" eventually. I should maybe also mention that he's taking antidepressants and I clearly notice the difference when talking to him if he took them or not.

Well at last I just wanted to add that this isn't my normal reddit account since I fear him seeing my post in some kind of way, making the whole situation even more awkward (especially cause I'm basically admitting here that he isn't of much worth to me (harsh expression again, I guess). I also want to mention that english isn't my native language (even though I'm pretty confident in my language skills) and I'm only 17 years old and overall a quite self-conscious person who generally uses the internet to feel more confident, even though I think I have nice friends who I can joke and have fun with (mostly over the internet and school, sometimes parties and meet-ups). Additionally this is my first post of this kind, so my structure might suck and the text might not be nice to read. I normally am a ""memer"" and don't talk about serious stuff with my friends all that often, especially not about personal and emotional stuff (might be because I basically only have male friends). However I still want to help him somehow and because of that I'm asking for your help, people of the internet, to be able to maybe save a live since I'm not good at this kind of stuff (no experience at all).

I really hope for some responses especially since I'm feeling very unsecure about posting this. :)",19Dec2019,1
137,"I‚Äôm 40 years old and a product of a very dysfunctional home growing up.  When I was 10 years old, my Dad had 3 major unfortunate events happen to him in the span of 4 months.  Loss of job (outsourced), his father dying and months later being screwed out of $250,000 in the will by his mother.  This unfortunately let my Dad to have a meltdown.  He reverted to a very childlike state.  Combine this with a workaholic mother who had to step up and be the only adult in the house, and my sister and I were left to our own devices much of the time.

Unfortunately the 90s were a bad time for me.  I could talk ad nauseum about how wrongheaded my Dad was.  Suffice it to say he didn‚Äôt work for 4 years and didn‚Äôt support his family.  He became verbally and mentally abusive.  Became very obese by comfort eating.  He was racist and sexist to begin with.  He was always immature about the subject of girls.  I remember he was teasing me about it at age 8 and realizing even then that something was wrong.  I was more mature about the subject of girls then he was even as a small child.  He also prized my supposed superior intellect and that was all he really cares about was promoting that.  To the point where he made me somewhat antisocial and ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù in an arrogant way from the other kids.

Our house became a cult where my  dad had absolute control and life was about appeasing him.  Eventually he opened a restaurant which never did much more than support itself.  My sister and I were essentially kept prisoner there much of the time, working for free ‚Äúin the name of the family‚Äù.  We were supporting my Dad, not the other way around.

So my Dad proved to be the ultimate negative role model.  What not to do and how not to be in life.  I had no guidance or support in developing work ethic.  I was an A student without much parental encouragement...I could have been more with the proper encouragement.  No career planning.  Work ethic.  Health and nutrition.  Getting along with others and being social.  Man tasks like changing a tire.  And certainly no guidance on women.

I estimate my Dad set my growth and development back by 4 years.  When I was 18, I was really 14 in some ways, 15 at 19, etc.  I am told by therapists that my Dad actually did retard my development in many ways, including me not really hitting puberty until age 18.  It was that bad and oppressive and immature in my house.  But eventually I did catch up.

Today I‚Äôve been in my field (IT) for 20 plus years, with a Bachelor‚Äôs Degree.  I make nearly 6 figures in the Midwest; not too shabby.  Divorced with 3 kids.  Great girlfriend.  Own my own home.  Lots of friends and people who respect me.  I rose up and beat it all.  Except...

The social stuff still really bothers me.  I didn‚Äôt kiss a girl until age 20.  Date until 21.  Sex at 22.  Being so late to the game there makes me feel like there‚Äôs something wrong with me to this day, because that‚Äôs not how normal people in Western society do it.  It makes me feel so pathetic.

It‚Äôs like the lyrics near the end of Father of Mine by Everclear:

I will never be safe
I will never be sane
I will always be weird inside
I will always be lame
Now I'm a grown man
With a child of my own
And I swear I'm not going to let her know
All the pain I have known

I have done all I can to give my 3 kids the life I should‚Äôve had.  My older son is about to turn 17 and he‚Äôs miles ahead of where I was at that age.  Because I made it my mission in life to give them what I should have had.  I fear that for me though, this part of me will always be broken and not right.  :(

Two final notes.  Yes I do understand some people have been through worse, before anyone jumps on me for that.  We all have our own pains.  And I know my Dad was dealt a rough hand in life...I alternate between sympathy for him as a tragic figure and fuck you-anger toward him",19Dec2019,1
138,"In 7th grade my mom pulled me out of school because I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 and she said she would home school me, she didn't home school me but she started home schooling my brother that got expelled. I basically spent an entire year literally locked up in my room until she put me back in school and I had to repeat 7th grade. I got to 8th grade and she pulled me out again, so now I'm 16 and I haven't been in school for about 3 years. I've begged her to sign me up, I've tried signing myself up, I've tried getting my aunt (a teacher) to sign me up and none of it has worked.

 I'm locked up in my room again and I can hardly talk or make eye contact with people other than my family and two best friends. I barely know how to do anything and I have no support. I'll legally be an adult in two years and I have no idea what to do. I end up crying and having anxiety attacks every single night because I'm so afraid of what will happen to me in the future. 

I've also tried convincing my mom to put me in therapy, thinking maybe a therapist could help me get everything under control but she also refuses to do that. I'm 100% sure it's because she knows that not putting me in school is illegal and that I'll talk about it and get her in trouble. I can't talk to her about anything because she is extremely selfish and won't listen to me, or she'll get really defensive.
It doesn't seem like anyone understands that I'm trying my best and that I just want some help.

139,"for those of you well versed in mental health or experience similar things, id like to know what fits the bill for my symptoms in terms of mental disorders etc. Also I have an appointment with a therapist, but it is in 2 months and id like some insight. 

1 - I feel like my life isnt worth it, and I wish I never existed in the first place. not exactly suicidal, but if I died tomorrow id be pretty relieved. 

2 - low confidence/insecure. im a college student and I have anxiety issues, which I believe are based on the fact that I feel inferior to many. 

3 - anxiety. im so anxious for the strangest reasons, mainly for social settings. this I have known for a long time and have been actively trying to overcome. in reality, I rely on drugs to make me feel normal. 

4 - drugs. I started using drugs at 15, mainly weed and the occasional alcohol. now, at 21, I use many drugs just to feel some relief from my normal state. weed, benzos, opiates, etc. anything to alter my state of mind ill gladly use. alcohol is what troubles me the most, as I use probably 4-5/7 days at a rate of 3-4 drinks just to sleep, because my anxiety and restlessness peaks when I need to sleep. 

5 - relationships. my first sexual experience occurred when I was 15. this girl stayed at my house via a study abroad thing and she introduced me to the whole ordeal. she was in her late 20s at the time and she sort of took control at the time. not to say I was traumatized, bc I did enjoy the experience and liked her, but it was odd. ive had 1 serious relationship since the in highschool that lasted 9 months and I was a huge asshole, something that troubles me till now bc of how obscure my jealousy and distrust was. it was unwarranted and it gives me anxiety till this day.  I have not been in any sort of relationship since, except for a few hookups here and there. 

6 - emotion. I feel as if my understanding of emotion is different from the normal, mentality healthy individual. I cant pinpoint exactly what it is but there are things that I overreact to, and many things that a normal person would overreact to and I feel nothing. 

7 - general wellbeing. generally I feel nothing, as if im a robot doing what it has to do. im a college student studying pharmacology; drugs interest me, but besides that nothing else really matters.  I only have 4 good friends that I see often that I feel entirely comfortable in their presence. I use tinder and other dating apps, but I often feel afraid of commitment due to my one and only relationship and still feel unworthy of being fit for a partner. 

Any ideas? im prescribed adderall which I take as needed and take alot of supplements:
NAC
Boron
sometimes B-complex

140,"Hi, this is my first time actually going public with my problem and i might have some issues expressing them due to a lack of english skills and or a problem with expressing whats going on inside of my head. Im a 22 Year old dude from Germany and ive had a lot of issues in my life with bullying which ended up in me transforming from a very extroverted child into a very introverted person. The bullying stopped when i got older but it feels like it already left its marks. Ive been told alot when i was around 11-14 how ugly i am and how pathetic i look. This literally still haunts me til this day and every time i talk to a girl the only thing going on in my head is those people telling me how ugly i am and that i will never have a chance and find someone to truely love in my life, especially because todays society is so based on looks and first impressions that i have no chance to truly show someone who i actually am.

 When i was around 17 i met 3 Girls who were actually my first real friends ive ever had although we did not do alot during the free time, the group of 4 of us spent the whole schoolday together .. breakfast before school , lunch , we sat beside eachother etc. one of them i studied for tests with etc. and she had a boyfriend which i knew i always had this ""butterflies in your stomach"" feeling when i met her and talked to her even when i went to sleep. But i could never imagine being in a romantic romance with that person i was not in love or had a crush on her .. after like 1 1/2 years our ways seperated because she moved and even months later i still had this feeling when i talked to her.

I must say here that i am completely incapable of bonding with males there is just too much about having a ""guy friend"" that makes me so uncomfortable like talking about ""that girls ass"" etc. i can not say why that bothers me so much but sentences like this make me want to instantly leave. Im not offended by it or in any way disgusted or anything it just makes me feel so uncomfortable that i want a hole in the ground to suck me up. 

 Now im studying to become a software developer and ive met a girl that i really like (in a friendly manner) and because we had a project together i started talking to her she gave me compliments and her number but i kinda got rejected again after asking her 3-4 times if she wants to go out and do something with me  (those 3-4 times were in a few weeks of time) so i came to the conclusion that shes not interested in becoming friends with me which is fine. There is ladders that are not yours to climb and i accept that, but i again have this ""butterflies in your stomach"" kind of feeling although i know ive been rejected in my mind ive accepted it but its not going away.

When i have a crush on a women i also have this exact feeling but at the same time its different like i know that it is something sexual so its not like i did not understand what a crush or being in love is. This feeling now reminds me of a lot of negatives and kind of pisses me off to be honest  since i get headaches i cant stop thinking about the person although i thought im over it and i am not hungry anymore.

 I am completely incapable of starting a conversation with any person ever, but when i am in a natural enviroment where talking to someone is normal i have no problems even bonding especially with females due to kind of similar hobbies. Im a very lonely person that has no one to go out with and i am insanely affraid of just randomly talking to strangers especially because in germany compared to the usa when you just randomly walk up to strangers and talk to them you get looked at like youre some kind of creep. 

My big problem now is that ive realized that i am at a point in my life where i  want a girlfriend and i want female friends and i accepted that me and male friends do not work but how on earth is someone like me who is even having problems with accepting himself the way he is due to psychological terror i make myself reminding myself of how ugly and disgusting i am with exactly the faces of the people who said that to me in my head going to find people to talk to, start a conversation and getting to know them better. And even if that works this ""butterfly in my stomach"" feeling keeps reminding me of the Failures and even when i ask a girl out on a date and she says no i can accept it but the feeling doesnt go away for at least 2 weeks!  I know for myself i am not ugly in my oppinion i am like the average blonde german looking guy you see here and there i just look like 4 years younger than i actually am. 

Now my question is .. is there anyone with similar problems or someone that can explain to me how this feeling is coming and or how to prevent it from happening? This shit is so weird i want female friends that have the same hobbies as me or at least some of em im quiet into fashion and video games which is not that hard to find BUT when i then have someone i am sexually attracted to i have the same feeling and it always reminds me of failure let alone how do i even meet or start a conversation with these people in the first place .. all of people ive met that i could call friends were just coincidencial and i was lucky that after getting started with conversations i forget about the back thoughts and things start going smooth.

I literally reached a point in life where i am constantly feeling a down and i want to go out and enjoy life outside of my video game bubble so bad but i just have nobody to enjoy it with but at the same time dont even try because of what happened to me when i was a kid which is incredibly stupid but i just cant let it go.",19Dec2019,1

Your whole body feels much heavier. You can lay in bed all day and still be tired.

153,"It started when my mental health went on a serious, fast paced decline at age 15. I was suffering from the memories of abuse from when I was little that go back to my earliest memories. All my childhood consisted of was sexual abuse and grooming. At 17, I dropped out of school because I knew that if I kept trying to focus on school and not my health, I was going to kill myself. I had already planned on how I would do it so there would be no backing out and no chance of survival. I already felt like I was dead anyway. I was so numb just from living.

Fast forward to now, I'm married to my husband and we have a 3 (almost 4) year old. I was on the arm implant birth control and it kept my already heightened emotions from during my pregnancy stasis. I was always freaking out about something and everything would get to me. I forgot what my depression was like because I'd been dealing with a different type because of the hormone regulation. Now that I'm not on it anymore, my seasonal depression is coming back with a vengeance. I forgot this is how I felt about life; numb, already dead, useless, a waste of space and a burden. All of these feelings are coming crashing back and it takes everything just to get out of fucking bed. I'm not doing the things I need to as well as I should, and that's if I even do it. I have even less motivation and drive than I did before and I thought I was already at an all time low. 

This is lower. I can feel myself descending into a really dark place, one where everything hurts me again and I have essentially no,life because of it. I can't wait until the winter is over. I can't stand feeling this unimportant, I hate that my husband not only supports me financially but he carries me emotionally, too. These days, he and my son have to be with me for me to get something done. How the fuck am I ever going to have a steady job? How am I going to be able to not only contribute to my household as a mom and a money-earner, but as a member of society? Some days, I really wish I had the courage to kill myself. But realistically, I'm a coward and wouldn't do it. I'm a lazy pessimist who doesn't deserve the family I have. They would be destroyed if I died, I know that. But I'm selfish and sometimes, I just wish life would make the decision for me already. That's how lazy I am. I hate having choices and needing to choose. But I also hate being out of control. 

I can't tell if I hate everything about living or if I just hate everything about myself. I'll never be successful like I dreamed of being, nor will I be useful to society like I should be. What good am I if everyone else is doing everything for me or carrying me? No good at all. I'm no good at all. It's pathetic.",19Dec2019,1

TL:DR My father told me (again) to ""make things right"" with my mother, who was emotionally neglectful and financially and verbally abusive of me growing up. I can't have a relationship with her because it greatly impacts my mental health in negative ways.

I have anxiety, depression, OCD, PTSD, and an autoimmune disease that flares up with stress and anxiety, and spirals into more anxiety and depression when things get bad. 

I stopped speaking to my mother 2 years ago when I asked for answers, for why she treated me differently than my siblings, why she expected so much of me, why she neglected, and verbally abused me. She told me she remembered nothing about me as a child, and when I asked why I was paying for literally everything I needed out of my own pocket starting at age 15, she asked me ""well, were you paying rent?"" As if that was a legitimate reason for expecting me to pay her credit cards, food, clothing, medical bills, car insurance, gas, repairs, school supplies and school lunches.  I actually ended up having to give money to my younger sibling many times, too. 

She said none of it ever happened, she was a great mom and look how good my son is, he's such a good boy, she must have done something right.

I now have a child, moved out of my hometown with my husband, and after reflecting on what kind of mother I was going to be, I decided I had to do the opposite of her if I wanted to break the cycle for my child and establish as good a foundation as I should have had. That's what sparked the confrontation 2 years ago.

Now, if I even think about speaking to her, my anxiety flares, I become restless, my heart races, I start sweating and hyperventilating. 

I've told my dad I can't speak to her numerous times because of my mental health, and he pretends like it's nothing. An army vet, who has been diagnosed with clinical depression, pretending that my problems aren't real problems because I was ""never in combat, never saw death, didn't have to fight for anything."" 

This week, my dad and I had it out as he called me childish for not getting over this, for dragging it out. I let it all out and explained just a ""small bit"" of the things she did/didn't do when I was younger and how it impacted me, even to today. It was a huge list, (imagine a text that you have to scroll from top to bottom about 11 1/2 times) and just thinking about it all, and writing it out caused me to go into a funk. I was sobbing all day Tuesday, barely got out of bed yesterday, and today, everything hurts and feels like a flare up of both depression and my autoimmune disorder.

My father has told me he's not going to be talking to me anymore. I didn't have a close relationship with him, but the way he would talk about my mother made me think maybe I'd have someone, but it looks like I don't. 

My in-laws and husband are very supportive of my decision to have no contact with my mother. My doctor approves as well, as I've only gotten back on meds when I've seen my mother or talked to her. I have a few close friends who support me, but with the holidays around the corner, I don't want to drag anyone else down. I don't dwell on her treatment of me, and unless he brings her up to me, I don't think about my mom, at all.

If it were all just thoughts and something I could easily get over, I would do it in a heartbeat, because who wants to feel like they're going to die all the time? But I feel like I've lost my only ""real"" parent and appear to be orphaned now.",19Dec2019,1

156,"I am 20 year old who moved out at 18, for some reason I‚Äôve just come to the conclusion that though I would say I am in a happy state 90% of the time, I can be laughing and talking to strangers one second, only to have either one of my parents come into proximity and my mood completely flips. I don‚Äôt get angry or aggressive, I don‚Äôt harbor any bad feelings towards them beyond normal family issues. I get serious, I feel uncomfortable laughing around them, or even smiling, as if I have some mental blockade that doesn‚Äôt allow me to be in any kind of joyous state around them. I can talk to them, but I can never do it outside of a serious frame for some reason. I have a deep fear that I won‚Äôt be able to drop these habits that keep us distant from each other, that they will get old and sick and I will regret not being able to enjoy being with them the way I want to.

157,"My brother is at the psychiatric hospital for schitzophrenia symptoms. He had probably been diagnosed but I haven't heard anything from a doctor. He doesn't think there's a single problem with him. I'm sure you understand what I mean. It isnt uncommon for things like this. He is saying things like ""I am the doctor"" and he told me he saw the past in a pot of spaghetti before. He goes on tangents that don't make sense, etc. 

Since he can't see that he is not well, he doesn't cooperate with his doctors. He won't take medication, nor work with his social worker. Since he won't comply, they basically have to discharge him. Like they can't do anything else. And he doesnt have a place to live and won't stay with my mom (which is kinda understandable considering that she has her own small struggles)

I don't know what to do. There is nothing I can do. He won't listen, nor consider anything anyone has to say. I'm so upset. He isnt going to get better. Its heartbreaking. I am so sad. I can only cry about it.  I don't know what to do - for him, and for myself.",19Dec2019,1

i'm not even sure what is too much to post on here, as this is my first time posting and i don't want to cause any triggers for others.
it feels like things are getting worse again, my sleeping pattern is way off, and the thoughts and voices are getting too much to deal with myself. i've actively looked for counselling myself, but most places where i live require a doctors referral. i guess i just need somewhere to let it all out and get it out of my head.. i'm not sure if this is the right place to do that though",19Dec2019,1
159,"Hello All,

&amp;#x200B;

After 10 years and a complete shitstorm in like, I finally sought help for severe depression. I don't think I need to go into the detail, everyone's life has shit times, I'm not special in that regard. Suffice it to say I've been contemplating suicide for almost 2 years. This summer I was out of town all but 2 weeks, ran out of my poorly working meds, felt like my travel schedule was too chaotic to make an appt, and events largely beyond my control put me in a near constant anxiety attack for a month. The anxiety came largely over fear of losing my job, and ultimately, the anxiety caused me to. . . well, loose my job. I'm not prone to anxiety, in fact have only been like that twice in my life.

On top of this, I was having hypoglycemic attacks which frequently caused me to black out. I passed out on the side of the interstate 3 times this summer and several more times at home. I am fortunately able to say that since losing my job I have gotten both the mental and physical help I needed. The hypoglycemic attacks seem to be stemmed as long as I'm on the medication, and switching to Wellbutrin has been a night and day difference for me. I feel like my depression is finally under control. I haven't felt emotion in almost 10 years, and yet find myself genuinely laughing at things, tearing up occasionally at sappy commercials/movies. It almost makes me miss being an emotional robot.

So now, I am not sure how to reconcile having lost the job due in large part to mental health. I have a MS in Chemistry and feel like if I spend too long out of my field, it will be harder to make it back in. I've been applying across the country, and just don't know how I can truthfully answer the 'So why did you leave your last job?' question when it inevitably comes up.

Thanks

&amp;#x200B;

To any lurkers.. . . I never thought I could be helped by a psychologist, and since many of the near by mental health clinics were clients, resisted seeking help. GET HELP. It may take many tries, but treatment is possible. Were it not for such a wonderful wife, I might not be here today.",19Dec2019,1
160,"I'm totally stuck in life and I admit that I don't do anything about it because I'm scared. It's almost like paralyzing fear. There are moments when optimism breaks through my consciousness and I feel like ""yes, you just gotta try"" but then there's this immediate backlash and I end up telling myself ""I can't""; ""I'm too incompetent"";  ""I'm too stupid"". I have low self-esteem and I feel judged by people all the time. I have a list of possible thoughts/opinions about me when I see other people and I hate that they might know what is going through my head. I don't want anyone to know that I hate myself. 

I hate that I am so weak. That I'm whining instead of changing, but then again, I'm just so scared. I'm scared that my family and friends will find out just how much of a coward I am. And I can't talk to anyone. Because if I do, they'll tell me to ""try to change and improve"" and I will disappoint them, because I just can't meet their expectations. I feel so damn hopeless. I feel like I'm drowning and I don't know what to do with myself. I don't know where to start. I don't even know if I want to change. I just don't want this life. I don't want to live with these feelings. I don't want anyone else dealing with my shit. My family and friends are getting impatient with me and I'm feeling like I'm slowly being driven into a corner. I wish I knew what I want out of life, so I could start living, but I'm dead. And I wish I were really dead. 

I'm a burden. I'm being stupid. I'm doing nothing to contribute and all of this is because I'm a coward who can't get out of their comfort zone. A person like me shouldn't be here. I really shouldn't be here. I want out.",19Dec2019,1
161,"I'd do absolutely anything to just be able to talk to people on a normal level without having to think about it. This isn't just social anxiety either, though. When I *don't* think about it and let my 'natural' self come through instead, I'm a completely different person.   

I'm a lot more lively, but I also don't pick up on a lot of super obvious social queues and can't really tell when the mood shifts. I remember one week, about a year ago, when everything just felt *so* natural. I was clever, fun to talk to, and I legitimately felt like a normal part of society. It also affected other parts of my life too, though. My posture got better on its own, my terrible memory was way better, and life just felt 'crisp' and real. That feeling went away before too long though and I'm back to being the quiet kid who people don't really know how to approach. 
  
I hate my brain so much. Like, I know I'm not actually dysfunctional, but for some reason my stupid fucking brain isn't putting the pieces together correctly. Why does this shit happen to me?? I don't know a single other person who has this issue and I just feel so isolated.",19Dec2019,1
162,"TLDR:Exhibiting signs of social anxiety, putting on a mask for others, and involuntary volume decrease in voice, I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs up.

Hello, thank you for reading this post. Warning, it‚Äôll be a bit long, it‚Äôs not urgent but I‚Äôve been wondering about this behaviour of mine for a long time... thank you if you read and respond.

So I‚Äôm a teenager, and I tend to exaggerate things in my head a lot, which is pretty typical among some teenagers. But at the same time, I‚Äôve been having some issues since I was a young kid. 
I never did have many friends, and I only spoke when I was spoken to by teachers, do a maximum of a dozen words a day or so. It led me to doing a lot of thinking, being much quieter, being very sad, angry, and feeling like I was in a hole that I couldn‚Äôt escape out of. I‚Äôm not sure if it was chronic depression or not, but I‚Äôm not sure if I was being dramatic or not.
Fast forward four or five or eight years, I graduated elementary and moved on to middle school. I decided that I would get the most friends by being quiet and sweet, which seems a bit odd looking back on it, and I still do this in high school. I kind of put on a show for anyone that‚Äôs around me, I can‚Äôt speak loudly, I act really nice to everyone and Mom them around. Usually it‚Äôs heartfelt, and I do really want them to be okay, but it still somehow feels very fake.
Fast forward to now. Whenever I meet strangers, my voice involuntarily gets quieter, so much so that the stranger can not hear me. I don‚Äôt notice myself going quiet, but I do. I used to be able to control it, but now I can‚Äôt. I can speak freely with people I‚Äôve known or talked to for over a year, but anyone else, I clam up. I‚Äôve also developed a fear to speaking to others, and I have exhibited several signs of social anxiety, but again, I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm being dramatic or not. I find myself acting a certain way to make an impression of a quiet, sad girl, when I‚Äôm actually boisterous to those close to me but the sad part is sort of genuine. Sometimes I fake being traumatized for some reason, or wise, I‚Äôm no sure why, and I always kick myself up about it afterwards but I don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs automatic.
I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm being dramatic or if I have an issue, or if I‚Äôm being a hormonal teenager. Or if I‚Äôm just being paranoid writing this, I just want to know if somethings up. 

This is not meant to compare with the experiences of anyone else with mental health issues, I probably am being over dramatic but I just wanted to be sure. To anyone struggling with mental health issues, y‚Äôall rock and are powerful and strong and amazing!",19Dec2019,1
