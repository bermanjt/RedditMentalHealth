0,"I’ve always felt different. I’m not like the other girls, you see.
I feel different, but not in the quirky individual sense. I feel mentally different. I haven’t been diagnosed with any mental health stuff at all ever but i mean, when you’ve been feeling worthless and have resorted to less than ideal ways to cope with stress and feeling like a piece of shit, you sort of know you have depression. 

So basically I have depression and have had that for uh. Ever? Can I just always have depression from the moment I knew I was a person who has a mind of their own. Idk. 

Aaaanyways I just want to ask this. Do I have some diagnosable fucked up brain stuff?
I’m 16, almost 17 btw. 

As a child I didn’t know I was me. I didn’t know who I was and I didn’t actually hardly think. Ever. I just did and I perceived the world around me and interacted with it. 

Until I was around 9/10 I didn’t have my own personality. I didn’t have proper thoughts or anything. It sounds weird and unbelievable but trust me, I was as dumb as they come. I was alright academically. I could talk to people, fight with bully’s, communicate. But I never knew what I was doing. It’s like my body was on autopilot 24/7. My memory was absolutely horrific. My mind would go blank every few minutes like a goldfish unless I was properly fully engaged in an activity. 
The only activity I was ever engaged in was gaming. Ever since I could hold a controller in my pathetic little toddler hands, I was gaming. I grew up on the PlayStation with GTA, crash bandicoot and a treasury of other games. All was played in third person. 

I didn’t have any friends as a child until I went to high school at age 11 so all I did was game. I got up at 7am and was on my consoles until 11pm when not in school. When in school it was from when I got home until 8pm. My brain was absorbed into these games and that’s all I knew, really. That was my reality. 

I suspect my parents took me for a mental evaluation when I was like 5 because of my night terrors every night but they brushed off the diagnosis. Idk. I was a really active sleeper too so I’d reenact my traumas in real life while still dreaming. That probably stemmed from the 6 years of bullying I went through and other stuff. Those stopped when I was 10/11 just before I entered high school. 

My thought process was detached at best. I literally didn’t have an inner voice until 10/11. I didn’t have a grip on reality so I just gamed and gamed. My memories are/were in third person, too. I had out of body experiences when doing day to day things. The strongest one was when I was walking with my grandparents, I stopped walking and away my spirit went. I saw me from above and like 2 metres away. Freaky. 

As a kid I was told off. A lot. Fighting was usually it. Self defence mostly. 
I was always mocked by teachers/parents copying my face when I was told off. I had wide eyes but a blank stare and face like I wasn’t there when screamed at. I endured some physical/emotional stuff as a kid. Sleep deprivation was quite often because I would scream in my night terrors. I was comforted by a parent, then took downstairs and then made to stand in the kitchen. I never had socks on either so that was a pain. 
While standing there, I was told to go to bed when parents went to bed. Sometimes I was told to stand there for a long time, I remember being told to stand there until I saw the sun rise. I was a good kid so I did. 
For hours I’d stand in the corner of the kitchen counter, hands behind my back not leaning on the counter because I wasn’t allowed to. This was roughly from 11pm-6:30am sometimes, depending on the time of year it was. 
I was woken up at 8:30am for school that day. 
I remember I would be standing there awake staring at the wall. My mind would go blank, I didn’t think, I didn’t move. The nights were long and the first 2 hours were the worst every time but you get used to it. 
It was like my charging station. I would stand there and my brain would shut off, eyes open but no brain activity. After 2 hours, the rest of the night would go quickly. I hated when I accidentally had a thought and then made my self aware again. My feet were so cold but then my body went numb. So I was aware and my joints creaked from the cold. 
I was made to do that so I wouldn’t have a second nightmare those nights and wake my baby brothers who were 1 at the time. 
I wasn’t aware of sunrise until the kitchen went brighter, so like 30 mins after the initial sunrise. I’d make my way back upstairs and go to a peaceful blank sleep. 
Then I forgot about the punishment the next morning and went to school. Got into fights, more detentions with writing 7 pages back to front of lines saying things like “I will not fight with ——“ forced to miss out breaks and stuff by my teachers because of this. I was always so out of it and disconnected. I’d come home and game again. I just had no self conscience. 

High school came around and then I started to be able to think a little bit. I gamed less and interacted with the real world a little more. I made friends which made my brain fight to work out how to communicate with them. I started to feel like a real person. 
I fully gained thoughts and stuff in year 8, I mastered friendship and from then on, I’ve been working out a personality. I am now fully me. I am really me now and have been for 4/5 years. I haven’t been punished like I used to since I hit year 7 so that’s good. 

More or less childhood has been my toddler years and high school had been childhood to suddenly teenage years. 

I’ve noticed I still carry some of my old behaviour though. People and sounds get too much so I don’t focus. I fiddle in class and then daydream which I was always picked on about by my teachers. I basically have had a bad habit of dissociation since I was born until a year or so ago. I’ve got it more under control now that I’m getting better. 

The way I walk and move is slightly jerky, I’ve been told that my knees lock a little when walking and I can never pay attention to the world around me so if someone talks or waves at me without engaging me first, I might miss them completely. 
My brain is mostly somewhere else but my mind is like a sponge for subjects I’m even a little interested in. I didn’t revise for GCSEs and still got decent grades that others worked hard for while I was just floating behind my body in class. 
For a time I’ve suspected there’s another person living in me responsible for my past disjointed consciousness and thinking. Everyone thought I was normal as a kid but I was completely out of it and I didn’t know what was going on or who I was for 9 years so maybe there’s another person and they’ve been the real primary me acting normal while I am out of consciousness. I’ve been me a lot more lately. 
For 2 years I knew there was someone else inside of me because I was sitting in my head looking at my body interact and live like a normal but severely depressed person. For 2 years. 
It was nasty. 
I also suspect there was more uh, traumas? As a child, physical stuff n all that. 
But I also believe that some of the stuff was in my head. Not the kitchen nights though. I remember I passed out a few times. 
I remember it got that often that my mattress was put in the kitchen by the washing machine with my blanket and pillow and I was told to sleep there to avoid disturbing everyone. My mum would move me to the couch sometimes at like 3am if she got up for no reason. I liked the couch better than the cold kitchen and accidentally touching the cold tiles at night. They were the best nights though because I got to sleep throughout the whole night. The kitchen became by bedroom for a while I guess. 

If anyone has a clue what’s going on in my brain please just comment below. I don’t know whats been going on. 
Is this normal to just have a sense of self at the age of 10 onwards or is this weird as fuck. Just asking for help :)",11Nov2019,1
1,"I'm diagnosed with ADHD, depression, and anxiety. i'm being treated with medicine and therapy. I told my therapist how I walked to the living room to pet my dog and couldn't remember getting up and walking over to her, and she said she didn't know about it. So since my therapist is useless, maybe some of you guys can help. I also just blanked and watched a video while my boyfriend was on the phone because he was being quiet and i immediately forgot he was there for several seconds. my mind has always been super sharp. could it be a side effect of medication? Is it a disorder on its own? i tried googling but i couldn't find much of anything because i don't know the terminology. I'd really appreciate some help, because it's starting to happen more frequently and I need to know what's going on. Thank you.",11Nov2019,1

3,I’ve seen a doctor for this before and he said I’m fine. But I’m really worried that I do have memory problems. Earlier I was taking a plate to the kitchen then when I got to the kitchen and put it down I went to make a sandwich and forgot I brought it there but when I seen it I remembered putting it there. Another example is I can be watching a video and receive a message and  click it on my phone to reply and forget I was watching the video and would go and do something else. I went on you tube and tried some memory test that shows you 9 pictures and asks you about them and I didn’t score to good. Someone please let me know what to do. My doctor thinks it’s just anxiety but when it was happening I wasn’t feeling anxious till after.,11Nov2019,1

12,"**The TL/DR**

Excited to share a free app I’ve been working on called Worry Kit.  It features has short (30-60 second) activities to help improve mental health in the moment.  These activities are based on CBT and ACT therapy techniques.  There’s a mix of breathing exercises, visualizations and calming activities.  Worry Kit is meant for in the moment relief, when you need to get a thought out of your head.

**The Background Info**
I’ve been really fascinated by mental health after my own bouts with anxiety and depression.  I think the work done in the mental health space has been really helpful, but nothing has really resonated with me.  A couple of years ago, I started collaborating with a close friend who’s a doctor in Northern Ontario who works with populations who don’t have access to traditional mental health resources. 

We did a lot of research, read a lot of studies and papers and explored different types of therapy.  I taught myself Swift to build early prototypes for visualizations and breath trainers.  Learned a lot about the space through building prototypes and seeing what did and didn’t resonate with people. 

Earlier this year, I caught up with an old coworker who also has a passion for mental wellness and since then we’ve partnered on Worry Kit as our passion project.  It’s been really fun and therapeutic to work on, as I often struggle finding meaning in my work.  

I’m really hoping we can create something that can help people.  It’s still in early stages, so would love your feedback so we can improve it.  We really would love to develop an Android version, but our knowledge is really limited when it comes to Java/Kotlin.

**Other Info**
We do not store any user inputs or any personalized information or personally identified information.

At this time you don’t need to Signup to use Worry Kit.  We will likely add these features later to save activities, track stats, etc, but we really want people to jump in and go.

We’re working on more activities, so if you have any suggestions or ideas, let us know!

**LIST OF MENTAL HEALTH APPS/RESOURCES**
As we’ve been researching Worry Kit, we’ve come across a lot of good Mental Health Resources that we think might be worth sharing.  It’s ever evolving, so let me know if you have any suggestions/improvements.  Eventually, will move this list to a standalone site, but just been a bit busy recently.

Anyway, I hope someone finds this useful :)",11Nov2019,1
13,"So I am a 25 year old woman dealing with four different mental health conditions; for all of them I have received a formal or informal diagnosis at some point. They affect me in different ways, all of which I feel like need to be addressed. However, I don’t know which labels to use and not use with whom and what to prioritize in seeking care or support. 

I also recently found out that my mother’s unpredictable (and often unfair) behavior is characteristic of someone with undiagnosed/untreated BPD. Which is especially ironic considering that she has a master’s degree in special education, yet adamantly refuses to seek a diagnosis, care, or treatment. She also is incapable of socially functioning for long enough to maintain stable employment, and does not have any arrangements figured out for her retirement (she’s turning 60 next year). 

Myself and my long term (4 years) partner have both tried to explicitly communicate the ways her behavior hurts me more times than I can count but she refuses to take responsibility for the impact of her actions. I moved 2000 miles away from her and stopped talking to her entirely for a few months but am realizing more and more every day that I’ve inherited a lot of bad habits from her. 

I don’t know if this means I also have BPD.  Or to what extent I could have just absorbed her behavior patterns. For almost all of my childhood, she was a single parent and I was the only child. I struggle daily with the ways that her distorted point of view impacted the way I see the world and make decisions. But at the same time, I want to hold myself accountable for improving my mental health and behaviors. 

I didn’t grow up with my father, but my big move was to live with him and build more of a relationship with him. He was diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease (Neurosarcodosis) in 2013, the side affects of which include irritability and dementia, he also was given a life expectancy of about 10 years. He also suffers from moderate-severe depression and would go on and off taking his meds throughout his life. He has a deep distrust of Western medicine (doesn’t seem open to alternative options either) and adamantly refuses to go to any sort of doctor unless it is a dire emergency. 

I wanted to spend time with him/take care of him before his disease progressed too much. I got here too late. I didn’t have enough trust built with him for him to trust me with caretaking responsibilities, I can barely convince him to let me take him to the grocery store. His living quarters are in a state of chaos, both in mess and in organization, he refuses to do any maintenance on his house (which is old and falling apart), I could go on for hours listing all the ways he isn’t taking care of himself. But all the sources say you cannot obtain social services of any sort for someone without them giving consent, and he adamantly refuses to consent to anything. He always said when he was healthier that he would just kill himself before getting to a point where he would have to rely on someone else to take care of him... he doesn’t realize he’s really already at that point and slowly killing himself by refusing to allow people to help him. 

So I’m in a position where I can BARELY function enough to take care of myself and it feels like it’s getting worse all the time. There are days I wake up with debilitating dread about going to work; it’s almost worse when I don’t work and feel the pressure on myself to get things done so I have something to show for myself. I also have an IMMENSE amount of pressure on myself to be financially successful to the point of being able to support my mother when she can no longer work, to undergo renovations on the house when eventually my father passes and I can take care of them, not to mention to achieve my own goals to get married, start a family, and further my education. 

I am blessed to have health insurance and the ability to seek mental health care. However, I just had to switch insurance providers when I got a new job, and jumping through all the hoops to find care providers and schedule appointments is so overwhelming. I know that’s probably the most reliable way to get help with all of this, but the process to find something is so hard, and in the past when I HAVE had care they’ve barely been able to address any of these concerns and if anything made some of them worse. 

I mainly wrote this to put this out there into the universe and admit to myself that the shit I’m dealing with is insanely complicated and “normal” people probably wouldn’t be that much better equipped in dealing with it. I would greatly appreciate any love, support, or validation you have to spare. But what I need the most are solutions; tips on what to prioritize, how to be compassionate to myself, ANY sort of idea what the hell to do about my dad situation... other perspectives could really help. If you stuck through this all the way to the end, thank you for hearing me out 💖💖💖",11Nov2019,1
14,"Ive been depressed as far as I can remember back, I don't even know why at this point, I've always carried on through it and never let it affect my day to day life, however I'm often incredibly impulsive which will lead me to make bad decisions.

My therapist encourages me to try to pinpoint it but I just can’t. I’ve been fighting self harm urges for months, and frankly the only reason I don’t relapse and do it again is because my boyfriend is going to find out, and it would hurt him to see. 

I’m starting to feel like I want to see my clinics psychiatrist, but I don’t know if it would be better to try another therapist first, maybe one with a different therapy style.

22,"When I was 7 my parents got divorced after my dad was abusive, and then my mother was so depressed that she emotionally neglected my sister and I.
 I didnt really have friends untill highschool, when I met a cute guy who eventually sexually assaulted me multiple times and I was too afraid to leave him and be alone, I also lost my closest friend from the time because he also raped her. After that I became super reckless and did drugs everynight, and even drove 400miles across country without even telling anyone at one point, with a person who I was in an abusive relationship with.
In my senior year of highschool I tried dropping acid for the first time and had two bad trips within the same month and I'm pretty sure I had a pyschotic break because the walls were breathing and swirling and I was super paranoid for the next 5 months afterwards and no one even bothered to ask if I was ok. 
Even though I've experienced all these things my mother denied me seeing a therapist throughout highschool, and now that I'm 20 and in college I tried going to one, but just became so triggered immediately and am too anxious to go back.

23,"Been having a really tough few months, and now I just broke up with my boyfriend who also happened to be my best friend + the only constant I have in my life. Now, I’m left absolutely clueless and I’ve been pushed past my breaking point.

At the moment, I’m feeling very odd. I’ve suspected for a while that I have symptoms of bipolar, just because I go through massive waves of emotion that either end in me trying to kill myself or me going crazy with motivation. It’s a burden to everyone, but even more so to myself—the smallest things tip me off into a spiral that I can’t figure out. Lately, I’d say I’ve been pretty manic, as I’ve been constantly busy (waking up at 7am daily and working til almost 4am, sleeping those 3 hours and repeating it). It’s not like I have to, I just can’t sleep unless I’m satisfied. As soon as I wake up, I go right back to work til early morning.

But this breakup has tipped me over, and I’ve been toying with the idea of driving into a tree or overdosing on my mom’s sleeping pills across my bathroom floor. The only thing keeping me alive is my mom—I can’t imagine her seeing my dead body. 

I’m on the verge of driving to the ER, just for the help, but I can’t afford it. It’s almost 9 here on a Sunday as well, so nothing is really open except the ER. I go into the city in the morning, so I can possible go somewhere then, but I’m scared of what will happen. I can’t afford any services, but I can possibly get a low-cost psychiatric evaluation under my mom’s plan. 

I don’t know what to do. I can’t tell my mom because it’ll break her heart, especially because my dad killed himself over mental health issues. I either feel so blank, or I feel like hanging myself—no in-between until something tips me over to the “manic” side.

He knows I would be willing to continue a relationship with him if he would start to go to therapy, however he said he ""wouldn't know where to start."" 

The holiday season is approaching, and in the past, I gave him books I knew he'd love; anything fantasy, sci-fi, horror, or historical fiction. Since the split, I've just passively bought him gift cards, but this year I'd like to get him a book on mental health. Obviously, I'm not going to go Brene Brown on him, but if anyone knows of a book that conveys a similar message with a David Sedaris or Mark Manson vibe, I'd greatly appreciate it.

But I can't. Sometimes stops me. I think about telling anyone where I'm at in my head and I immediately shut down. 

Half of me says, ""you're fine. Dont make this into a big thing. You don't need to cause a scene over it."" While another part of me thinks, ""maybe it would be best to just overdose on something.""

32,I’m just tired and sad and I’m tired of being sad. Sad because I’m tired and I just want it all to go away. I don’t know what I’m saying and I don’t expect anyone to respond or understand but I’m so sad and tired.  I’m trying to go to bed but I can’t stop crying and all I wanna do is just run as far as I can. But I can’t leave because everyone depends on me to be happy. Running makes me happy but when I run people say I’m too slow or I suck at it. There’s no purpose to this post other than me just ranting and hoping someone’s listening. My friend is waiting for me to text them back but I don’t want to because they’re probably happier that I’m not bothering them. How can I just leave without killing my self. Killing myself is bad and it’s wrong and too many people will follow me. I’m just sad. Sorry if I’m confusing but I’m just writing everything that’s going through my head and not expecting people to understand. I don’t know why I’m writing in a post that people can see rather than in a diary. I think I just want some human to hear my thoughts. Thanks for reading.,11Nov2019,1

34,"I was sleeping on a bed next to him with him in the middle and my best friend on the other edge. We were all very very drunk, I had vomited about 3-4 times. He had kissed me while drunk a year back but because he apologised profusely and more than a year passed I thought I could trust him. Also there was no other place left that I could sleep in. 
Long story short, throughout the night he kept feeling me up and idk because I was drunk or something, I let it happen only moving to let him know it's happening and he used to remove his hand the instant I moved. I have a history of freezing up/not doing something drastic when something of this nature happens. He kept sliding his hand under my clothes and forcing my hand to touch his dick. Whole time I was facing away from him. I kept hugging myself tighter and tighter so he couldn't touch me. He even tried to put his dick in my pants. I still couldn't do anything except move around. My friend woke up because she had to leave early and I went with her and I broke down and I told her everything and she was very angry and guilty because she was right there and she couldn't help me. She had no way of knowing because I fucking froze.

I told my boyfriend about it as soon as I could. He was supportive and wanted to kick this guy's ass(they know each other), but I didn't want this thing to spread because we're in the same college in a conservative country. So I told him that I'll talk to him(god knows what I planned to say) face to face later. But idk why my bf went behind my back and went straight to the asshole to confront him and this guy calls me and pretends he was too trashed to remember anything and he's sorry(!!!!!) if anything happened. I've been trying to deal with it by not really talking about it and just pretending nothing's wrong and I've been pretty good at it. I've cried a lot the first day and only cry when I have to describe it. But this stuff just keeps me up at night and I have no motivation to do anything. 
Ok so here are my questions:
1. how do I forget and move on from this?
2. How do I prepare myself for these situations better so next time(hope there's never a next time) I  don't just freeze and let it happen.",11Nov2019,1

40,"So for about a couple months now, my mental health has been deteriorating. I’m pretty young so my parents won’t believe me when I say something like, “hey I think I have a problem.” Anyways, what’s my problem are my emotions. They are constantly changing rapidly. For example, I was talking to a friend , having a good time, until I felt so upset to the point I wanted to hurt someone. (I would never really hurt anyone though.) And this is something I can sorta control though. If I’m with a friend and I start feeling different, I can just play it off and actually feel the emotion I’m trying to play off, but as soon and I’m alone I go insane. Sometimes I’ll feel crazy and laugh violently to myself, and other days I feel extremely anxious and self conscience. Sounds a lot like bipolar, right? I don’t think that’s the case though. Why is tat? Well, I just feel like it may be something worse, (not saying I’m ‘better’ than bipolar people.) I used to think it was just social anxiety, because I feel so embarrassed if I even make a noice when people like, 20 ft away are talking. Anyways, I’m kinda rambling so I’m just gonna stop.

42,"I graduated this year and received my diploma. Around that time I suffered a mysterious shoulder injury that came from nowhere. Still, I was able to walk across the stage and get dinner with friends but over time it became more and more debilitating. My symptoms started to change. At first it was only the shoulder and now it’s all over physical weakness, shortness of breath, numbness, tingling, and the list goes on. I’m unable to do anything for myself. I spend everyday in bed and only leave if I have a doctors appointment. I’ve seen so many different doctors. Family doctor, neurologist, neuromuscular specialist, ENT, dentist, optometrist, physiotherapist, and plenty of hospital visits. Nobody can seem to figure out what is wrong as all of my tests and scans come back normal. I know for sure something isn’t right and now my doctor is giving me antidepressants. I personally don’t feel depressed at all and I’m not in any pain, I’m just weak. One other option was to get Botox shots in the back of my head but I’m a little skeptical as to how that would fix everything. I’m still willing to do it if it means I’ll be able to function again. 

On top of all of this, my uncle who is schizophrenic moved in recently with myself and my mother who is recently diagnosed as bipolar II. My uncle is the sweetest man ever but he simply can’t grasp my mother’s disorder when I explain it to him. My mom is on medications and does various forms of therapy but she has made little to no progress. She has recently picked up drinking again when she just had an alcohol abuse session a few weeks ago. After that session she quit cold turkey and was doing a bit better but she has relapsed. When I was able to function properly, my mom would be a lot better. I would encourage her and go out with her, she was much different. Now with her seeing me in this state has been hard and taking a toll on her even more emotionally. My mother is a single parent and I’m her only child. 


I don’t even know what happened to me. I was fine and then all of a sudden on day my shoulder/neck pain started and I was debilitated. This has all been going on since May. I was still able to function at a decent level earlier this year but now I can’t even get down the stair without help. I WANT to get better, I WANT to get out of bed, I WANT to go get a job, I WANT to finally start my life as an independent adult but I keep running into these roadblocks. I’m still strong mentally but I can’t lie and say that it doesn’t get hard sometimes. My problem is that I’m very impatient and when there is a problem, I solve it immediately. I’m not used to waiting months for appointments or depending on a pill to make things better. 

I just wanted to vent and see if anyone had some suggestions as to what I could do to maybe get back oh there. Thanks y’all.",11Nov2019,1

45,"My family is extremely competitive. They don't mean to be, but, with siblings as perfect as mine.. well, it just happened. I ended up dedicating my entire life to being my best self. That got derailed when I fell into depression around 14 years old and gained like 70 pounds. Maybe 2 years ago I somehow pulled myself up, got the 34 I needed on the ACT to get into my dream school, U Michigan. I worked so damn hard. I balanced a job, a sport, 14 clubs, and school all while being minimally anxious and depressed.

Not long ago, that changed. The 40 pounds I lost to get back on track have been slipping. I gave up on my dream school and instead am attending the same one as my sister. I've been considering not even going to med school. I find myself yearning for nothing more than sleeping all day, smoking, drinking (two things I avoid at the moment), gaining all the weight I want, skipping classes and dying alone.

46,"Hey! Im 16 years old, male. Now I want to start off by saying I am not looking for a diagnosis, I only want to know if I should notify my family about my behavior so it is taken care of responsibly.

For my most of my life, I have had trouble trusting people’s word, mainly due to my classmates bullying me for the entirety of primary school and most of middle school, as well as my mother’s tendency of rumaging through my room to look for crinkled papers and assignments.

Now, I am 16, and I believe I am starting to see the effects of this on myself. Last year I moved schools, and although the beginning was tough I managed to make friends, however, I am having trouble trusting them. I dont know if it is them or me, but some of the people in my circle have been less than caring or kind to me. The girls are also a problem. I have been used for a plethera of things, whether material things or emotional support, it seems as if everytime I start getting close to them I get shunned away and left to rot on my own. Some incidents have only worsened my suspicions. When I first joined my new school, I believd I was friends with a small circle of people, but I did something which I believd was the right thing to do (long story) which landed me with a healthy dose of bullying and mockery for the better part of a year. Not to mention, in my previous school a specific student had been the bane of my existance for years, constantly talking poorly about me and causing my friends to grow apart from me was also attending the school. Not only that, if not the fact that I believed we were on good terms only to be mistreated again. Fast forward to today and I can’t hear my name (or believe I heard my name) without jumping or getting agressive. The constant mockery of my facial features and appearance have made me unmeasurably scared of mirrors and cameras (to the point where I will chase and force anyone who photographs me to delete the photo). I have problems talking to girls because I believe I am not enough, and besides I feel as if my attention is unwanted and even the girls I consider friends seem to be interested in themselves rather than our friendship. My friends are now really friends but sometimes I have the unbased suspicion that they may not really like me (athough, again this id purely me and there is minimal evidence to back this up). I can’t go to the bathroom without worrying someone will come in and mock me. I can’t do anything, even in my house, alone, without feeling like I’m being watched. Everytime someone looks in my bag or my room I get incredibly anxious even if I have nothing to hide and finally, I feel as if everyone I know is ingenuine, even my parents who I feel are incredibly selfish and arrogant. So my question is: is everyone like this? if so how can I calm my paranoid behavior down?",11Nov2019,1
47,"I don't know how else to describe it. I feel like I'm drifting in and out of reality all the time. I don't feel like anything I'm doing is really real. Last night I forgot where I was and thought I was in my childhood bed, and I had the same thought this morning. If I don't have any obligations I completely lose my sense of time and I lose entire days just laying in bed. And even when I do, it's a toss up as to whether the deadlines I have set in my head are actually accurate. It's seriously affecting my schoolwork because I just forget or misunderstand when my exams, homework, etc. are. And I'm so stressed out about disappointing my family but at the same time I can't make myself really care about failing. To make it worse, my inner monologue is still surviving when my connection to reality isn't. I have these thoughts that my whole family is going to die in some horrific car crash, or that somebody inmy family is going to commit suicide and there's nothing I can do. And then I'm worried that after that they'll go to hell, and I'm going to go to hell because I'm gay and I can't ""give it up."" I wasn't even raised with religion.

I know I'm depressed. I've been here before, I've ended up in a psych ward. So I don't know why now I can't make myself go to my campus counseling or even just the health center. If I wanted to go back on antidepressants I could and it wouldn't be super expensive, and I don't my parents would ever have to find out I'm depressed again. My roommates are worried and I can hear them when they talk about me. I feel like I don't have any real reason to feel this way, my life really isn't that bad at all. I'm worried that if I go to counseling they'll tell me I'm faking it and being manipualtive or they're going to tell mee it's not depression. And then I'm worried that if I go I won't be able to adequately piece together all my thoughts, and it's going to come out all disjointed like I know this post is.

48,"Just to preface, I’m in the process of getting results from some tests I’ve taken late last month.

I’m very sensitive to noise, touch and sometimes light, so when I’m feeling overwhelmed in that sense I tend to isolate myself or just get frustrated.

Today, I don’t know what was up, every noise was bothering me. Every word that came out of someone’s mouth, every bit of background noise, any time someone tried to get my attention I felt like I was just boiling up.

I get home every day, just try to relax, and my family talks so loudly and I’m struggling to just make it through without having an outburst of anger. Whenever I get angry or irritated, I usually make it pretty well known. And my family has a tendency to always trigger me with these issues.

Anytime I’m interrupted, talked over, or even having a conversation that can get a bit loud, I get irritated. Sometimes I’ll be polite and ask if they could keep it down or just have a civil conversation, but other times I just snap. I was talking about something and my brother interrupted to say something and I just snapped at him and said “can you just not interrupt me”.

I come home today and it’s all the same. Loud, irritating. After some time I go up and just isolate myself because I just want to be alone. Boom... knock knock on my door, it’s my mom asking about some random stuff, two minutes later knock knock, my brother wants to look for something.

I’m fine with being part of the family, but I just wish I could be alone. And seeing how my frustrations and struggles affects them, making them feel like I don’t want to be there, they get frustrated when I snap, it just makes me feel so awful.

I feel like I’m just not meant to be part of any group. Not meant to be part of any family. I’m not meant to have friends or relationships. All this social obligation is just too much to the point where I’d rather be alone but can’t bear being alone.

I’m just stagnant, and I just hate myself more and more each day. I wish I could cry. I wish I died all those years ago when I overdosed. I wish I could just disappear.",11Nov2019,1

I cannot and we do have double glazing so sound shouldn't really penetrate the room. He is letting the sound really get to him and has become furious with it.

52,"Hi all,

I reallllllly hope this community lets me post this. I even created a fresh account to dedicate to wanting to talk to people more about my anxiety in order to get some community type support.

I've had anxiety/OCD most of my life (diagnosed many many years ago). Sometimes extreme, sometimes mild. I've been on and off all sorts of medications and in and out on a few therapy sessions. I've been married 14 years now and have 3 daughters (8 yo and twin 2 yo). Life is busy. Most of my major OCD issues are largely gone due to my family life in fact.

For the past 4 years I was taking Lexapro. 6 months ago, I decided I slowly wanted to come off of the medication. Reasoning being pretty simple, I wanted to come back out of the fog. I wanted more of my personality back but full well knowing that I'd be once again battling my OCD and Anxiety. With that said, during those 6 months, I tapered off my medications and am doing very well. I'm also taking daily CBD oil and its also doing quite a good job. I'm feeling pretty good overall!

I work from home, remotely, for an amazing company that I love. I've worked from the bottom of it, to now being a director. I adore my job. But, becoming a director means I need to fly out to the businesses HQ once or twice a year for a in person team meeting. This company is relatively small, and all the people I am meeting with are awesome people and great friends. I've been looking forward to this trip. It's on the 17th-20th, a very short trip and a non-stop flight from my current location (Southern California).

The amount of anxiety I am having about this trip is just...blowing my mind. Daily, I'm over analyzing absolutely everything about such a simple trip. Will my luggage fit, is it the right size for carry on? Are my liquids ok for TSA? I hope I make it on time, what if my flight is cancelled, what if what if what if. I've done my absolute best to systematically work through all those illogical thoughts. Everything is measured and is scheduled out. I will be fine. But my mind...is letting go. I'm really stressed about leaving my family. I wonder if that may be worse than the trip itself. I haven't left my twins and 8 year old in many many years. My Wife has this 100%. Not at all worried about that aspect. It's just...the simple thought of leaving them. Oh, and when I land at my destination, I need to Uber from the Airport to the hotel where I'll be staying at for the rest of the trip. Even the meetings are at the hotel. Ubering from airport to hotel has me stressed.

My mind is over active. I need help calming down about all of this. Perhaps even in some of this text you can detect a bit of frantic nature. Thats it in a nut shell. I'm really upset at myself for feeling this way. It makes no sense. Everything will be fine. I will be fine. I'll have fun even.

Anybody have ANY advice for me on this..? It's really wearing me out. I've been like this for maybe the past 2 weeks. By the time the trip arrives, it'll be 3 weeks. Arg. It’s exhausting..

Side note: I do not have any fears of flying itself I wanted to add. In fact, I quite enjoy flying..thankfully!",11Nov2019,1

57,"I'll try to be brief but I guess I'll start with where I am right now. I am an undergrad at the U of Waterloo,  in the life science program. I am from small town north of Manitoba, the move to Waterloo was a big change but a welcomed one seeing that I was miserable in my home town, can't say I miss it. The only reason I can afford to live here and go to this school is because of my grandma, she is a nurse. She has done so much for me, more than I can ever repay. I would say I've struggled with depressive symptoms and anxiety for the last few years, and it only spiked recently due to a bad relationship, after it ended I started having panic attacks, it felt like all i could do was go to work and come home and wait for the day to end so I could go through it all again. I thought my condition would improve when I moved to Waterloo, but after a few weeks I had a bad panic attack and almost passed. After this incident I sought help and was immediately put on anti-depressants. I've been struggling at making friends, and keeping up with my courses. As I mentioned before my grandma has done everything for me, but she can only do so much. She's helped me pay for alot but If I want to stay in school I need to get student aid, which I've tried but at the same time I feel so overwhelmed and unmotivated I've been struggling to apply. My grandma said If I didn't get the funding she wouldn't be able to retire this December. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I had to do that to her. At the same time, I've felt so unmotivated to do anything, I can barely get out of bed, let alone go to my classes or do my assignments. At this point i'm pretty sure I'm going to fail all my classes, I don't know If I can go back to my hometown this winter and tell her I failed, to tell my friends and family I couldn't do it, that I wasted her money. The anti-depressants I have make me feel numb and emotionless, I don't feel sad, but I don't feel happy. I'm currently on a wait list for counselling, but i'ts been awhile and they make it difficult for me to book the walk in sessions. I don't know what to do but keep trying. I don't want to be alive anymore, but I don't want to do that to my family, especially my family who already lost two of my cousins due to a drunk driving which destroyed them.

60,"I really need help my whole life I’ve been lying about everything that I do. This all started when I was younger my father told me to lie when people asked me about my religion. Instead of telling people I was Muslim I would tell them I was Christian instead. From there it just developed, I told all my friends I was sexually assaulted ( never accused anyone ), then when I was in a relationship I would lie and say men were trying to hit on me when they weren’t, I would lie to him about little things, and I told him about my “sexual assault” as well. Once that relationship broke off the lies just kept getting bigger and bigger. I would lie about sleeping with men and how many men I’ve been with. I’ve over exaggerated about having “beef” with another’s girls boyfriend. Ive lied and said I’ve hooked up with women and I’m gay. There’s just so many lies I can’t even remember them all. Just recently I faked my own revenge porn and I realized how much trouble I could get into with the law of any of the people accused try to bring it to the police and say I’m attacking their character or accusing them. I only got scared because I can get in trouble for doing this. My lies usually only affect me but this time around I’ve dragged others into it and I feel scared for myself because of the trouble I could potentially get in. Usually I know I can get away with it so I’m not so on edge. I’m not diagnosed but I’ve been looking everywhere just to try to figure out what’s wrong with me. I already went in to see a psychiatrist and I’m waiting for my referral to go through so I can get some serious help and a diagnosis.",11Nov2019,1

65,"So I’m 29 and my anxiety is getting worse or maybe I’m becoming more aware I don’t know. Anyway today I was feeling anxious and my family and I stopped at a gas station to get my son a water before going to the park. When I got back into the car my husband and son had the music up high and that instantly made me anxious. Sounds sometimes do. Anyway then I was pulling up to fill the tank up and the anxiety threw me off and I forgot which side of the car the tank was on and it erupted into me screaming at my husband for basically no reason and skipping the park and now we’re in a big fight. 

I assume other people would just get into the car turn down the music if it was too loud for them and pull up to the gas pump. If the forgot which side it was momentarily, no big deal but I can’t. I don’t react to regular situations rationally. I blow up for no reason and then feel so stupid when I realize my reaction was an over reaction. Friday I drove 4 hours to attend a wedding and left an hour before it started to go home because my 1 year old was cranky. He’s one. Of course he’s cranky. 

I absolutely hate it. It’s effecting my life, my marriage and I’m sure eventually my parenting.

I still retained the same personality in this state when interacting with others but overtime and I think partly because I would do it so often, my dissociative state has started to become almost like it's own person. I dont do it on purpose anymore but in times of high stress my inner monologue will almost try to bully me into disassociating and giving it full control and anytime I try to take control back, it's as if I'm in a mental fight with myself. I was wondering if anyone has possibly gone through something similar and if so, if they have any advice on how to improve the way my brain talks to me

Sorry if this was explained poorly. I grew up in a household where men didn't cry or express their negative feelings openly so I dont talk about this stuff much

71,"I’ve never been diagnosed with anxiety or depression but I’ve always had a feeling that I was dealing with some sort of mental health issue. I used to consistently have wild mental breakdowns that included my eyes practically swelling shut from crying, barely being able to breathe between unnecessary screams and sobs, and self harming. These episodes would happen once or twice a week between the ages of 15-17 until... well.. I started smoking weed and stopped being so ridiculously hard on myself for no reason. I’ve since then been an occasional  smoker to relieve some of the stress of being an engineering student working 20+ hours a week to keep up with rent. I’ve also always been really introspective and have paid extra attention to figuring out why I think certain ways or finding ambiguous explanations for my obscure emotional outbursts. I used to kind of think I was bipolar in a sense... but then realized that my case is no where near as bad as the typical bipolar person. Anyways, the past year or so after the first semester of college has been interesting to say the least. My emotions have been ALL OVER THE PLACE, and I can’t seem to figure out why. I’ll be sitting in lecture or at my desk job and suddenly my mind starts flooding with stupid things like “should I go get lunch? Should I not spend the money? I really need to clean the fish tanks when I get home, I wonder if he’s thinking about me? Holy shit my nails look terrible. And I think my laptop is nearly dead so I should probably consider where I am going to sit in the library to do my homework 4 hours from now.” And it never fucking ends.

I’ve spent a bit healing from previous trauma, and I’ve been doing much better than before. However, there’s one “problem” I haven’t really discussed with anybody because I’m not sure if it’s just in my head or something, but I’m just, really out of it *all* of the time. 

I have no fuckin clue what’s going on 100% of the time. It’s not bad enough where I forget where I am or what week it is, but I have trouble remembering what I’ve done vs what I’ve wanted to do.

Sometimes when I wake up I fall back asleep because my dreams feel real enough to pass as reality, and they’re just more fun in general.

i have the option of getting my GED at my high school, but i honestly don’t know if i should. 

i don’t have a social security card, my mother lost my old one, i don’t have an ID, because i’ve never been to a DMV, and i don’t have a license because i can’t even think about driving being in a passenger seat w/o having a panic attack. 

i want a job. but i can’t get one, because i don’t have a SSC, license or GED/in school. 
i have to wait until i’m 18 (in 2 weeks) to get my GED or enroll in the program. 

on top of that, my s/o and i want me to move into his house w/ him and his parents, but i feel like i’m not ready, because i don’t have a job, or a car. i know i will be stressed when i first move in and looking for a job is the last thing i will want to do, so there’s no way im moving in unemployed. 

BUT. 

hopefully the 25th i will be going to the social security office to get that sorted, and then on my birthday go get my ID.

89,"So lately i've been doing pretty bad mental health vise. For the last 2 months, i've noticed my depression and anxiety being really bad again and so it also kind of made me fall back into my old eating disorder ways even though i've been recovered for a while.  I've noticed myself feeling panicky to eat again and was thinking about what i ate again all the time.

Anyway, it hit me like two days ago when i was in the living room and my brother came in to join me. He suddenly looked at me and was like ""are you eating enough?"" and i was like ""yeah, why?"" and he told me ""you just got so thin already"" with this genuine worried look on his face. Now of course the ugly eating disorder in my head liked this but my own voice was far from happy with this. Yesterday in the morning i stepped on the scale and was kind of shocked. It showed a number that was way too low for my height (i'm 5'7). Now again, the voice was like ""yessss look how low it is, this is good"". But i knew that this isn't good and i don't wanna be like this again. When you deal with this, you don't even notice that you might lose a bunch. 

The point of this story is that this morning the voice told me to not eat breakfast but i forced myself and ate it. It was hard but i pulled through. I just really don't wanna live like that again, with that damn voice controling me all the time. Eating disorders suck the life out of you completely. I know that if i wanna get rid of the voice, i gotta fight against it, even though it is scary. I did it once already, i can do it again.. It really is exhausting.

91,"This is a long explanation but I will try my best to be clear. This experience has happened four or five times so I can work out what is happening but I don’t know how serious it is. 

I find that when a room gets really loud with lots of different noises going on I start to panic and cry. I’ve only had two full breakdowns from it but both times I had to have someone else calm me down and couldn’t pull myself out of it. 

Like once at a big dinner party. People are all having separate conversations, plus music in the background, and the clicking of plates and glasses, someone is trying to talk in my ear and it gets too much. All at once I can hear all the noise but can distinguish any words or anything. The situation becomes overwhelming and my body starts shaking.  All the noises start to produce the same response as nails on a chalkboard, laughter becomes terrifying and painful. When I tried to hear anything anyone was saying I found that it all blended together and I can’t breathe, my chest feels heavy, my body locks up and I can’t move without a lot of effort and I’m crying.  

I had to leave the room and even then the feeling didn’t go away. It took maybe half an hour or more and I couldn’t go back inside. I broke down crying and had someone sitting with me until I stopped. Afterwards I had trouble speaking, or forming thoughts. 

I also find that it happens more easily after spending all day around people, especially when everyone is stressed out and dealing with everyone’s emotions has been draining my energy.

I am looking for participants from all backgrounds from the age of 16 to fill in a short survey as part of this research - the study doesn't take long and involves 4 short questionnaires about your thoughts on life, your need fulfilment and one questionnaire about mental health. The study tries to take a positive psychology approach to mental health by looking at why people want to live and the factors related to that.

97,"So I never really had a problem with panic attacks at all until recently and even still they were scattered. Not common. But this week I had two. Well at least I think they were panic attacks. The first day I had just come back from the library typing up my short story and was going to lunch. I already don’t like the noise that the people create in the cafeteria so I sit inside the counseling center. It’s quieter and I can eat and have a quiet conversation with the secretary. But I wasn’t feeling okay so I stayed quiet and ate. After lunch I went to my 5th period and talked to the teacher about something and sat down. I started twisting my hair and eventually lead to covering my ears. The noise in the room though it wasn’t very loud I was still sort of overwhelmed. I then proceeded to stay with my ears covered for 10-15 minutes before going in the hall. I sat down and covered my ears for what felt like forever. It was quiet and nice, but I started shaking as soon as a teacher started talking to me. When the bell rang and I switched classes I didn’t cover my ears but I still didn’t wanna be touched or talked to. I just wanted to hide. Fast forward to fourth period the next day and I’m sitting in class before the bell rings. The class is significantly louder than what I’d like and I’m irritated by it. I cover my ears and just sit there. I listen to what the teacher had to say and then sat in the hall. I wasn’t shaking as much as I did last time but I still wanted to hide and just be left alone in silence. Noise hasn’t always been an issue but lately it’s been one. I just want everyone to be quiet. Better yet I wanna be isolated. Its too much everything is too much people are too much... I’m about to graduate in December and I feel like I’m not an adult.

Music is everything to me and I've been trying to practice my bass and learn more about theory but in the past week, I've had a very bad depressive period and I've not been able to properly practice, focus on what I'm doing and I feel like I'm incapable of playing whilst feeling numb/drowsy/depressed or even delirious. It's making me feel like utter shit because of my inability to play like I normally can. I don't want to lose my interest or my skills but I don't know how to escape this phase and get back to my usual routine etc.

104,"I’m going to therapy (for social anxiety, anxiety and depression) 5 months already, but so far it doesn’t help much. I like my therapist, I think she’s good at what she’s doing, I think the problem is in me.

The problem is that my something feels like it blocks me from accessing my emotions, especially in social situations. When my therapist asks me how I feel when I’m telling her about my problems, I simply can’t answer that question. I don’t feel like I have any emotions when I talk to her about even the most depressing stuff in my life. She told me that my mimics look very suppressed and that she thinks that I’m disconnected from my emotions.

Now that Im thinking about it, it makes sense. I often feel nonsensical emotions, like I feel good about thinking about very dark depressive shit and I feel aversion to stuff I should do for my own good.

She also thinks that I talk to much about what’s wrong with me and my life, instead of trying to dive deeper and look for the root, which she encourages me to do with her questions, but I always end up going back to the surface level. The problem is that I don’t know if there is more than the surface level. Or maybe there is but it’s subconscious and I can’t access it.

I generally feel like a lot of my problems are mostly subconscious. For example my anxiety - I’m often not even anxious mentally, but I experience physical anxiety. Or even when I feel it, changing the way I think doesn’t help - f.e. I often feel like everything I do is awkward and lame. I know rationally that it’s not true, I repeat it to myself in my head, but I still feel like that on an emotional level.

It seems like therapy is all about changing the way you think about stuff, but the way I think is very disconnected from the way I feel about stuff. I don’t feel like it’s possible to connect with my emotions by just talking to a therapist. I feel like my brain just doesn’t work properly.

I have an appointment with a psychiatrist soon and I wan’t to get on medication, but people often say that medication isn’t a miracle cure, that it just makes things less intense. I feel like I’m doomed for life and won’t ever feel normal. I would be very thankful for any advice.",11Nov2019,1
105,"Hi guys. 

I just want to know what others have experienced in their life. 

Disclaimer: I'm just ranting right now so I am sorry if it's not making any sense or if there are mistakes in my post. Also there are some mentions of suicide, so if it's graphic or triggering for you, please avoid this post. 

I can summarize by saying that I sometimes wish I was dead, for no immediate reason. It's just what I feel like I wish I had been, just be no more. 

I don't know how to describe it. Yes I do get depressed sometimes, but I do try and get help. I go for therapy once in a while (even though I don't see much impact by that).
I do get suicidal sometimes, but I don't act on it or do any self harm (mostly because when I try to find a way, it feels like I'll fail in it, not that I can't go through with it but because the means of committing suicide which will guarantee me that I won't fail is relatively low in the region where I am from. Like guns and poisons are really hard to come by and other methods will talk time because I don't live alone and the risk of them finding out is higher in the process). But yeah as I was saying, I do get suicidal from time to time, but it's not that I'm talking about. 
It's the longing inside me to not exist anymore, like to be no more so I just won't be alive anymore. 

And what's bothering me about it is the fact that I can't find why I feel like it. I manage by setting myself some goals, maybe short term or long term  and try to finish them so I'm distracted from that inner feeling most of the time.
I try to do most of the textbook solutions I can find, like trying to spend time with others, reading, hobbies (I did develop a lot of skills because of it like musical instruments, cooking, crafts, painting, even fitness which I really was proud because it gave me the best summer body I could ask for 3 months) and other ways I can keep myself busy. 
But at the end of the day, I still feel the same. The feeling that I wish I wasn't existing anymore. 
I really can't pinpoint why I am feeling like this. 
So I just wanna know if there's anyone else who feel like this.",11Nov2019,1

107,"Even into adulthood I somehow managed to keep getting excited about my birthday.  For some reason I'd built it up into my head as being the one day of the year that's mine, and I'd kind of use that as leverage to do whatever I want to do for just one day.  Special birthday dinners, picking the activities I do when hanging out with people, all that jazz.

I'd always start planning things like two months in advance, scheduling everything, figuring out what I wanted to do and have to eat and drink, asking all my friends if they'd be around to spend some time playing some games with me or something.  I'm a homebody and all I've really had for ages is online friends but even getting to spend time voice chatting playing online games with them means the world to me.  I love getting to stay up late, playing games, watching movies or something.

Then last year I kind of got put in my place and was made to realize how silly I'm being.  Long story short, it did not go at all as I'd planned, a lot of people I'd been counting on spending time with me chose not to, I was made to cry about three separate times by being treated pretty poorly and then everyone bailed by midnight (most of these people don't work and are often up until 3-4 AM so it wasn't like a curfew/bedtime thing) leaving me sitting here feeling completely alone and awful...which always sucks but especially on your birthday of course.  The only gifts I got were a Waterpik from my mom, which is a cool device but it seemed like an odd choice of a birthday gift and had me really self-conscious that there was something wrong with my teeth or something, plus some goofy joke hentai girl Steam game.  I hate complaining about gifts because I feel like it seems shallow and entitled but it all kind of added to the whole...bad feeling factor.  Then I ended up getting teased about something I'd said while venting about the situation for months after the fact, constantly reopening the wound. 

The day after that while venting to someone I was told ""well yeah you're almost 30, no one cares about your birthday but you.""  It hurt so badly but they're totally right...and I hate it because right then it was like that excitement I'd always get for special occasions died.  It wasn't only my birthday, I'd always try to plan things for things like Valentines and Halloween and etc.  I've always LOVED Christmas so much and I had next to no Christmas spirit last year.  It scared me because it was so unlike me and I worry that being told that and the shock from the birthday thing and everything is sort of what led to it.  I always loved celebrating all sorts of occasions with people.  But my birthday was particularly special because I felt like it was *my* day...and when my day didn't go how I wanted it to and when I tried to seek comfort from someone I was met with a slap in the face reminding me how ridiculous and selfish I was being.  They were right...but it still hurt.

So now this is the first birthday coming up since all that and I'm not really sure what to do.  The friends I mentioned above, I don't really talk to them much anymore, I kind of got cast out.  They did not like dealing with my mental health problems and the way they treated me really exacerbated them and it was all a really bad cycle.  So they're not an issue.  I  do have one newer friend I talk to regularly and I've been considering asking her if she wants to do something with me on my birthday but I feel bad because that voice saying ""no one cares about your birthday but you"" keeps ringing in my head.  

It's like I *want* to be excited for my birthday because I think of how excited I used to get and all the fun times I've had in the past, but I can't stop thinking of how stupid and selfish I am and how no one really cares.  Plus after last year I'm scared, I'm scared it won't go well and I'll be crushed again.  I'm scared I'll ask this friend of mine to hang out with me and she'll say no and then I'll be alone.  So maybe if I just kill any hope and excitement now it won't be an issue.

110,"(UK) I have an account on Twitter that is, by and large, dedicated to discussing/tweeting about football (soccer) and through this platform I’ve spoken to and got to know many football fans. However, one particular person (we’ll call him Charlie) I’ve talked to several times accepted my follow request onto their private account two weeks ago and for the past month, the tweets have been describing a numbness, inability to cope with life and generally disturbing themes. It’s worth noting that Charlie mentioned that he started a prescription of antidepressants 2-3 weeks ago.

In the last few days it’s become worse, but today is the final straw - I need to do something. A tweet from late last night, of which I appear to be the only viewer, reads, “Night all, I know no ones gonna see this so imma just say that I’m glad this will be my last few days on earth”. This morning, a tweet simply reads “14 days”.

What do I do? I don’t know him in real life, nor do I have any other connection to him other than through social media. I worry that my words will have no impact on him as I’m not in his life but it’s pretty obvious that Charlie’s getting little to no help from those that are in it.

111,"(this survey has been approved by the [r/mentalhealth](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/) moderators)

Dear Sir/Madam:

We are a team of academic researchers interested in early detection of signs of depression. The main purpose of our project is to instigate the development of automatic methods that try to learn how to link word usage to psychological problems (e.g. depression, eating disorders, self harm, etc).

We really believe that this kind of ""text mining"" research might be valuable as a complement to more traditional screening strategies. As a matter of fact, there are multiple studies that show that depression is often undetected or detected at a late stage. We think that these low ratios of early detection could be improved. At least, we think it is worth to try.

To meet this aim, we need some data from individuals who were diagnosed with depression. If you were recently diagnosed with depression, we would greatly appreciate if you could fill the questionnaire attached. It is a standard inventory of questions related to depression and used by psychologists at the earliest stages of detection of symptoms of depression. Note that the questionnaire contains a field in which the respondent has to provide his/her Reddit username. This would help us to link word use (as extracted from your Reddit's public submissions) with the level of depression (as estimated from your answers to the questionnaire).

Of course, we will treat the information you provide with the utmost confidentiality and privacy. All information we will extract from Reddit will be anonymised and we will be the only one capable of connecting your username with your postings and your questionnaire. Such information will be kept in an encrypted file and will not be disclosed to anybody.

The information you will provide through the questionnaires will enable us to properly weight each and every symptoms to enable their best identification in what people writes.

We really thank you for your time and consideration, and we hope that our activities help to gain insights into the development of depression and how it affects those who suffer from it.

Also, I get unsolicited comments about how attractive and great I am, yet I get rejected when I ask a girl out who made these same kind of comments and I thought for sure would at least go on a date with me. I know it's just how shit goes sometimes, but I've just been taking things really personal lately and I feel like everyone is judging me.

115,"This is the second part if you will or my continuation of my post yesterday. Check my profile for the first post.


Also thanks to the people who reached out with messages and Dm's. It was kind of you. There is probably no going back or changing my mind but still I'm grateful. I never had anybody care about me in real life. It maybe dickish of me to assume but I think it's just so people feel better about themselves thinking in their head ""I'm such a good person. I talked with a depressed dude about not killing himself.""


I basically am fed up with my sad existence. I have been thinking about suicide since I was 13 (24 now). I distracted myself with video games, movies, tv series, anime and so on for some time. I binged everything, I saw a video describing this behavior as chronic depression. Eventually I got bored from it all and got a job. I noticed how pointless it all is. Wake up, go to work, pay taxes, earn a wage, pay your shit, pretend to have friends which 99% would stab you in the back if they had something to gain from it. Go and consume drugs, alcohol, entertainment so you could ""relax"" from work and then repeat the vicious cycle. I do not partake in such a vapid lifestyle. Most people do. Everybody I meet looks at me weirdly when I tell them ""I have no friends"" but the fact of the matter is they don't too. People lie to themselves and my problem is I am brutally honest with myself.


In the past people had Country, Religion, Family, Friends and so on to keep them together. A common cause. A goal. And now countries are businesses, citizens are trash and the governments are ponzi schemes. I don't have a family. Religion is a joke. Friends are just acquaintances with whom you share a few interests. There is for the most part no real friendship in this world.


I tried to set goal for my life so I could get through the suffering and anguish of my day. I wanted to save up money. Buy a house and a couple of apartments and rent them out when I paid back my mortgages so I could leave my country (Germany), retire at 40 and live off the rent in a nice sunny country where I could grow old. Drive my Porsche around and play video games and have fun.


Such a shallow dream. I don't want that anymore. I want to stop waking up every morning. That is a much better solution.


In today's day and age marriage and children are a nightmare. I can't trust modern women. Divorce rape and paying child alimony is not what I want. Also I don't want to be cheated on and if a woman is even slightly attractive she will sooner or later cheat no matter how good you treat her. If you say otherwise, you are very naive or blind.


Just to clarify I'M NOT GOING TO KILL MYSELF NOW. I view life as a bad video game. I want to do some stuff before I uninstall. I have a bucket list and a list of positive things when my heart isin't beating anymore. Would love some feedback and Ideas.


Also please don't comment or message me saying I should call or text a suicide holtilne/message center. I will never go to a doctor/shrink or take meds. Antidepressants are poison. I would rather swallow the cyanide I have hidden in my home in case I wanted to end it all than to let some idiot take my money and tell me what pills to chug.


I am not a foodie. I'm not a car guy or a sports guy so don't message me with ""Germany is gonna win the next world cup"" as motivation to keep living or some stuff like that or food related stuff. I don't care. I have no joy in life. I can't remember the last time I was happy.


So here is my list of pro's for death:

-No need to go to work

-No more paying taxes

-No more pain every day when I wake up alone

-I won't have to see my father ever again

-I won't feel the need to lie that I go to brothels when people ask me why I don't have a gf (It's actually cool to buy whores where I'm from)

-I won't cry myself to sleep on my birthday

-I won't start choking up when I think about my life

-I won't have to talk and interact with the worms feasting on the world's rotting carcass known as humans.

-I won't have to fuel myself from hatred and despair just to keep my lungs functioning. 

-I can finally rest. I've just had enough.


Bucket list:

-Go to a strip club. Never been.

-Go to a brothel. At least I'll have tried it instead of lying.

-Go to a shooting range and try an AK-47 and some other guns/pistols for fun.

-Maybe skydive but idk if you need training for it. If it's too much of a hassle I won't do it.

-Go on vacation. I don't see any country that would interest me since I will go alone and I don't see what could be fun alone. Maybe you can give me some advice.

-Be on a yacht/ship for a few hours.


I don't really have a big list. If you could give me some ideas thanks.


Maybe while doing these activities I will find something worthwhile so I don't commit to ending myself. Doubtful but a possibility. I wish there was something to keep me going.


I imagine I will do the final act by the end of next year. I will keep living as I have been if you can call this even a living. And do these activities.

It’s a point of interest for me personally, since I’ve decided to step away from it completely &amp; live life like it had always happened in the days before the over saturated connected community we seem to live in today.

I’ve had instagram since the start, but since then things seem to have taken a turn. In the beginning it was novel &amp; different to what we’d known before with Facebook and Twitter. It was solely about photography and taking pictures, and as a photographer by passion and trade, the appeal was right on the money. There was a few years of half interested instagram use for me personally, it was no where near as popular or powerful in society as it seems to be today. It was just a bit of fun. Since then it feels like the fun has really been lost, instead now it’s a mass of emotion damaging exposure - exposure to what? I’m not sure. None of it seems to have much substance, it’s consumerist rubbish mostly to me. I feel like it was particularly damaging to me as a photographer and artist, because I was suddenly seeing what everyone else was creating all the time and comparing it against my own. Feeling like perhaps I wasn’t doing enough and that others were. In reality, there’s no comparison, but it’s hard to escape it coming across that way.

Mental health &amp; instagram seem to be walking hand in hand, the exposure to each others lives at every minute of the day is damaging, and it would seem that people feel the need to do so. Attention spans are non existent, the pressures people feel having seen the way others live, is eating away at our quality of life. I’m of a generation that is both pre &amp; post internet, it’s not alien to know a world without these accessibilities, if anything it creates fond memories of simpler times with a lot more genuine intimacy. This feeling seems to have been lost, and replaced with an inability to switch off. I often find myself on the tube, bus or in public noticing more and more the crooked stance of someone lost in their phone, particularly instagram. Endlessly scrolling, but not looking like they’re even enjoying themselves. Putting their phone away, getting it out again flicking through and putting it away again &amp; again in some uncontrollable way. It’s unsettling.

It’s a subject that, when I’ve discussed with friends and family they agree. It’s recognised individually by people, but nothing seems to be done. Not at this point anyway. All that I can see as a method to eradicate this issue of unhappiness is by boycotting instagram, but with how widespread this is it seems unrealistic. It’s a nice idea to unite to battle something that’s so poisonous, but part of me also knows it’s so far gone and deep rooted. For myself, easiness isn’t the foremost thing I look for in life. It doesn’t always mean the best way, and it promotes laziness in some instances. All the ease has given us time, and what we seem to do with it is scroll through instagram or some kind of mindless equivalent instead of something productive or worthwhile, or even just enjoying doing nothing! Alternatives are there, and were used for such a long time before hand. Would it be such a bad thing to just stay at that level? It doesn’t feel so.

I’ve read plenty on the subject of instagram and mental health online, and people often turn to say that it’s not ok to condemn the application, and that it’s about a balance. Personally I don’t agree, because the app isn’t developed in that way, it analyses us and feeds an addiction. It’s become what represents a person to others, and in that creates a pressure and awareness of how we come across to people we don’t know. Perhaps even employers &amp; people who may help financially. It’s a CV &amp; website rolled into one. Personally, I’ve worked too hard in my day to day life to be judged off my instagram. I have a website, which is curated and personal as well as a CV with credentials reflective of my expertise and yet it would probably be instagram that determines my worth as an artist. It’s a first point of contact, even in day to day experience it’s more common to be asked of an instagram handle than a phone number or email.

Observation of smartphone use has been a thing for me, for a while. For example, I love music. Especially live music, but I feel hesitant to be in the situation at times because of surrounding people. Entire shows fed onto instagram, with no appreciation of the moment and just being. People stare at their screen and lose themselves in an artificial world. It’s hard to be a bystander to this behaviour and it’s more and more common. The exclusivity of situations gets stripped back when this kind of thing happens, a photo or a video with no place to show it off to others is just documenting, and that’s perfectly fine. It’s okay to keep things for ourselves or for our friends and family and was the way things had always been done before. Anything worth sharing for the public can be submitted to interested parties, papers, magazines etc. It gives the subject matter and the capturing of the moment more meaning, instead of being lost in a sea of information. Lot’s of this mentality comes from my day job as a photographer, and the struggles that come with the career choice. Moments in my opinion ought to be as they are, there’s no reason to over do it with video, photos, social shares, live streams etc. We have the ability right there in our pocket, but it feels abused. Overdone.

At this moment in time, I think a little simplicity might do the world some good. More face to face, less over the internet or at least use it with moderation. Anything to better our mental state and make us more appreciative of the moment. We need to take some inspiration from generations before, and ultimately not feel like our lives are dictated by the actions of people we see via social media. Just enjoy our time whilst we can and not have negative, damaging emotions hanging over us. It’s not rocket science, but just takes some self control, will power and unity to do so.

127,"So I am a college student and today morning something happened that is extremely painful to me, I have never been so sad.

My mother today made a very vicious and rude comment about my face. In her words, my acne scars look like ""SHIT"" on my face. This happened without any context, she was not mad at me or anything, she just said it. That's what Indian parents do as they get old I guess, lose their freaking mind &amp; sense of basic courtesy.

She has said this a million times before and mostly jokingly, but today was a different scenario. Today morning, after waking up when I looked in the mirror, I was overjoyed and satisfied with my appearance- clean shaved look with absolutely zero acne. After so many years I was looking at my face without pimples. I was so much happy, my acne treatment and rigorous skincare routine had finally worked. I went running wearing my favourite black tracksuit. But when I came back she dropped the bomb.

The whole day I was thinking about this. It was a very unproductive day, I was not able to do study. All I was doing was looking up scar removing creams on Amazon and 1mg. In the evening I went to my dermatologist, he advised me to wait out on my scars, ""they will fade away by the time"" he said. I was told that LASER is an option, but only for the future. That doctor took my Rs.400 for nothing.

My scars are limited to a small patch and are not much visible too. I was fine with them until today morning. Her comments were so harsh and callous. I can not even get her to properly hear me out. It is useless to even try talking to her, I am all alone in this.

I am feeling so bad now that I really want to cry out loud now. This was so hurtful. Words can really hurt a lot, people need to realise that.",11Nov2019,1
128,"So, I (28M) have had depression pretty much for as long as I can remember. I was hospitalized a few times as a teenager and been on more medications than I can count. I consider myself a pro when it comes to ""What I should be doing"" to keep myself balanced. I know almost all the self help techniques and have a dedicated support structure just in case I need help. Coping mechanisms are huge for me. I spent a majority of my time orienting my life in a way that my depression doesn't drag me down. I haven't had any sort of self harm or other incident in over ten years and was even reaching a point in my life where I felt comfortable owning a firearm for self protection.

When people ask what depression is like, I like to tell them it's like having an evil monster following you around always telling you really hurtful things and trying to convince you that you aren't worth it. To run with this analogy, my depression monster has always been by my side. However, I ""looked beside"" me one day a few months ago and he was gone. I was ecstatic, and felt borderline euphoric. I realized that nothing was dragging me down anymore and felt like I had just won the lottery. Over the next month I took advantage of this feeling to do the things I've always wanted to do like clean my house, learn guitar, be confident when talking to strangers, dancing with women at clubs (I am a notorious non-dancer), and even setting social barriers with some-semi questionable friends (more like acquaintances) that I wasn't comfortable confronting before. Things were great and for the first time I started to wonder if I had beaten my depression.

Then one day, I woke up and the depression monster was back. And it looked like he had been hitting the gym in his absence because it hit me hard. I couldn't do anything anymore all of a sudden. I just cried for most of the day and watched bad movies. I tried to continue with cleaning the house (and other positive coping mechanisms) but just couldn't bring myself to do it or get close to feeling the satisfaction I usually did. It got so bad I had my friend take custody of my firearm just to make sure. I all of a sudden didn't trust my emotions anymore which was a first since even before my really good mood I knew how to handle them despite being depressed.

The depressive episode only lasted a few days before the depression monster left again. Currently, I am in a hesitantly optimistic place and I have some questions.

Before this all happened I had a particularly dark night where I was absolutely sick of the way I thought. I don't remember wanting something so much; to think like a normal person and not have brain that hates itself. Could I have triggered some sort of denial about my depression leading to this good mood?

Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? I don't know if it is a symptom of something more serious and the last thing I want to do is go on another medication (I despise anti-depressants).

I'm somewhat frightened of what will happen the next time the monster comes back, if he does. I wasn't in control anymore and right now I have more control than I have ever had.

Is it possible that I did beat it and, being so used to being in a depressive state, sabotaged myself into spiraling out of control? Am I afraid of feeling normal somehow?",11Nov2019,1

So, every day that I wake up, I find it difficult to get out of bed because I dont feel that I have any particular reason to do so, I've tried setting goals and things to do but I just get to the point that I feel overwhelmed and it makes me want to hide away.
This comes from a mix of not knowing what I want to do with my life and also a mix of always hiding my feelings when it comes to life in general.
I dont by any means have a difficult life but that just makes me feel like I should have nothing to complain about but I just always feel completely lost... I used to have a girlfriend and a job but she broke up with me after 3 years of a good relationship but couldn't tell me the reason, I then lost my job due to budget cuts.
I just feel that I lack motivation to do anything anymore and I hate the feeling because it makes me feel incredibly lost and empty but I just dont know where to turn to.

As I've never had feelings like this I dont know what is causing it or making it happen. Am I depressed? Am I lonely? Do I have something wrong with me?

I just want to be motivated again... I've tried signing up to the gym but I just lose all motivation after a couple of weeks and I simply dont have the self confidence to join any social clubs or anything.

Any advice of where to turn to or where I can get some help would be incredibly appreciated, I just dont know what to do :(

138,"   Hey, everyone. I've recently started taking medication for my depression and anxiety. I've also recently developed a crush on a girl (which at first I asked myself if it was a real thing or not, but right now I'm pretty sure it is). We just started being friends but talking to her, making her laugh and helping her out with college (I'm one year ahead of her on the same Bachelor program) makes me distracted. I get to forget a lot of stuff for a while and I get to feel some joy. I smile genuinely with her. 
   Since I'm going through the worst depression I've been yet, I caught myself wondering just how right it was for me to rely on this feelings for self improvement. I usually come to college so we can chat for a few hours (which doesn't always happens), I dress up thinking of looking good and presentable for her and I can't avoid but getting myself fantasizing about our first kiss and how we could make it as a couple. But that's it. I doubt she feels this good about me, so I'm thinking it's a pretty nice way for me tall flat on my face again, especially since I'm not at a point where I can rule out rejection. 
   I don't know how to deal with this because my hobbies are not as interesting, I'm barely studying and I can't feel at peace or whole unless I'm talking to her. Although she knows I'm on antidepressants, I'm also pretty afraid of telling her about this since we only know each other for about a week and the last thing I'd want is to scare her off my life. I wonder if I should stop trying and get to know her better because, honestly, no one needs this kind of drama in their life. But also, I think I should work my way up so she gets to be the one to make that choice. I don't know what to do having to see her every week and I don't know how to keep my life going outside of this context. I'm pretty scared about how things might turn out, since I feel I'm one slip away of blowing this out of proportion. Can anyone share something that might make me more confident about this and how I can not forget the rest of my life over this feeling?

140,"2 time college dropout, lost the one I love and am completely unable to really cope with responsibilities.

I don't really know what I want, so I'm just venting about my current spot in life.

I went to college for free, twice, like what a steal... and I squandered each opportunity because I could not bring myself to wake up in the morning. Each morning I just hated myself and everything else so I would miss classes and whatnot (I was actually an A-B student when I did work seriously) though I had no drive normally. Eventually found someone I loved but lets leave that out. (Even if its very important)

Its been 2 years since and what do ya know, I cant hold onto a job. Maybe I just really hate the modern way of having to work just to exist, making little money to support someone who really doesn't care about you. I had one job for almost a year but once again depression came knocking and my really good attendance streak bit the dust hard, only making it to work 3 days a week (it was fulltime). So now I'm out of money and about to lose my car and I cant seem to care anymore.

On the bright side I applied to college for the third time, hoping to get back in after going through therapy for a year. Since I'm out of money I haven't been in a few months but I think its okay because its ""up to me"" to make the difference or something like that. Thanks for reading.

I feel like too many people just try so hard to discredit hard facts and it gets me so upset.

I had one such instance today with a coworker who said he doesn't believe the protests in Hong Kong are the governments fault and that the people there have probably done wrong. I'll admit, I don't know a whole lot about exactly what's happening in HK but I have a general sense of why the protests are happening.

Anyhow, what my coworker said got me so upset. To the point where I began to feel like maybe there is something wrong with me and maybe I need to take a step back and reevaluate myself and why his opinion gets me so riled up. I realize that I refuse to respect the opinions of people who deny plain, hard facts in general.

I would normally consider myself an open person but I feel like me getting so upset over this is unreasonable.

I've struggled with anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation for most of my life.  Each year I try to do little things to make myself better. I don't have a lot of money, so a lot of my time focuses on self help and self care (meditation, exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy workbooks, etc.).

The one place I struggle is in being kind to myself.  It's really hard for me to do.  Every morning my internal monologue is ""you're a fucking idiot, why even try, no one likes you, I hate you, you are a failure,"" it's a constant stream of hate directed towards myself.  

It usually continues until I force myself to exercise, and then it stops.  I like that I've found a mechanism to stop the self-hating diatribe, but I'm hoping to eventually get to a point where I don't hate myself so much.

I'm realizing that so much of my problems stem from the fact that I don't see myself as worthy of love, and I don't see myself as worthy of self-care.

Either way, you can’t remember or make out any details about the cars, just that you know you saw them, and the. They were gone. Before you knew it hours had gone by without you even realizing it. You were at your destination. 

You are in middle school now, heading to an amusement park. You chose the biggest roller coaster, because you thrive off adrenaline. The Titan they called it. You walked to that ride with such determination, got on, strapped him, and the ride began to move. At the time it had the tallest drop in the United States. A steep slope never seen before. You begin to hear the click, click, click of moving up the roller coaster’s hill. Slight panic takes over you, but you contain it, before you know it you are at the top, overlooking the city, and then, the drop. It was pure slow, anticipation to the top, once there, you sat for why get like forever, you could see yourself standing in the middle of the park, waving, walking towards the exit. Then you drop. There was no way to describe it, and how could you, you don’t remember. Before you knew it you were standing on the ground near the exit, and when you looked you up, you saw people at the top of the slope of the Titan, waving, before dropping. 

You are in Guam, 18. Fresh to the military. Fresh to Guam. Looking back on that time, you want to remember all the good memories, they are there, but the whole 3 years was a blur. Men give you so much attention, you don’t know what to do. You think love is this new fond thing you’ve discovered, sex. It’s start with the breakup of your first true love from boot camp. Then you meet a bouncer, he fucks you like no other. On the kitchen counter, the ocean, the car, fingers you anywhere in public. You move in with him. Every night he gets off work at 3am, you feel his cock press against you, then against your face, in your mouth, and eventually you are on your knees while he pounds you hard from behind. Eventually you think this is the norm. Months later, he grows bored, you go back to the barracks. One night you go out, meet some guys, thinking that sex and letting them touch you is the only way people will like you. Guys always buy shots for pretty girls. There’s their faces, laughter, then I’m on a car. Eventually We stop, I’m carried over the shoulders of someone into a house. I lie on a couch and think, finally, sleep. Guys start to rub me, I feel someone penetrate me, pound me hard, I couldn’t speak. A guy has done it before, nothing new. Then I’m on my knees, on top on one of the them... I feel a pain like I’ve never felt. I don’t understand what happening. The room feels like cars zooming by, I can’t make it out, nor their faces. I remember the warmth of someone’s chest against my cheek. No for comfort, but to silence me. The pain stopped for a minute, not before another one took his turn. Laughing, as two of them dominated me at once. Everything went black. 

You are 22, finally thought you found love. The days come and go. He moves to Texas. You workout all the time. You remember gym, gym, gym. No work, nothing else about your life. One day he comes in drunk, angry. He hits you, you stab him. Or so you think. You just know that there’s blood on your hands, and a slice across his stomach. You remember his eyes. But just like a car speeding by, you are in the Er, then home. How? No police, I fell, and be cut his stomach while working cattle. Typical country right? He’s gone now. How’d that happen?

23, you meet Your now husband, before you know it so much as happened. 2017 is here, December. You feel off, can’t run, sleep, eat healthy. You drunk all the time. What happened? They are louder than ever. School becomes hard. Engagement, marriage, seizures, they are louder. Classes fail, time disappears. 

It’s now. You are dreaming. That’s the only reasonable explanation. You have been this whole time. At home, then like a car passing by, you are at school. How did you get here?  You see yourself walking towards the car, and drive away. But are you in it? Did you go to school? While I stayed here? Waking through campus there’s a life in my hand, no one moves. It has to be a dream. But how do I wake? Everyone I see now is dead. The reality I live in is dead. Do I need to wake up? People drive around watching my every move. They know what I’m thinking. But is it thoughts? I’m in Dallas, killing a Homeless man, burning him in the woods up north. But then I wake the next day, not wake... I’m sitting on the couch. Friday came, and today is Monday. How? What has been accomplished. I don’t think I’m awake anymore. I think I slipped into the dream dimension 2 years ago. A lucid nightmare. I need to wake up.",11Nov2019,1

I don’t know all the ins and outs of fpp and I don’t like self diagnosis but I’m pretty sure I might have it? I don’t know. I live in a fantasy world all day and sometimes all night, forcing myself away if I need to concentrate before going right back into it. My current world if by far my most intricate and I’ve been ‘living’ in it for maybe 8-9 months? I’ve expanded it and the characters and I have storylines which I switch between when I feel like i want something more/less heavy or sappy or sad etc. I love all my ‘friends’ to pieces and its probably really unhealthy for me because I kinda feel I’m loosing my grip on reality a little because I’m living within a world where I am literally above humans and my value for human life is decreasing (as I found out with a conversation yesterday with my friends when I said I wouldn’t feel bad about killing someone for money and my friends told me for f**ked up that was)  

I feel like I’m missing out on a lot of reality and as I’m in secondary school, a lot of my memories that I should have. They’re all just being taken over by my fantasy world. I might just have a tendency for day dreaming but I think there’s a definite line between imagining a scenario in a class and being in a fantasy world with fantasy characters from the minuet you wake up to the minuet you go to sleep. 

I just don’t really know what to think? Like, do I have it? Do I not have it? I can’t really go to see someone professional about it as I don’t have money (and I’m quite young so I’d probably have to get my mum to do it and I don’t even wanna get into where that’d go)  a part of me wants to have it because it would explain a lot but idk.

Overspending, overeating, unable to take care of basic personal needs including cleaning, no social life outside of work. Meeting and talking to people I spend my days working for 8 hours, then distracting myself with weed, netflix, and video games. I have been doing this for almost every day for years now. 

Thinking of changing the way I treat myself and live sounds exhausting, tedious, and not worth it. I know it’s not “normal” to think that, but I really need to change. I’m kind of starting to scare myself. The voice in my head is angry, paranoid, and anxious. My days are kinda just meshing together and it’s like I can feel my life just flashing by. I’m completely alone outside of work. I just got out of a 2 year toxic and serious relationship and now I just don’t know what to do.

171," 

I am feeling bad. Yesterday I was really bad.

Yesterday I had a break down over something completely tiny, though it is linked to other things. The night before yesterday I had asked my bf 3-4 times to stop to get me a dr.pepper on the way home. Two of the times was when he was on the way home.

The next morning I (home alone) not even 15minutes out of my bed about to take laundry down, I had to stop to let the dog out so I checked the fridge to see where he put them. Only to find he never got them. He somehow completely forgot and just picked up our roommate and went out to eat. I was at work the whole time on one of my almost 13hr shifts the night that I told him to pick them up.I got so ridiculously mad. I just had a complete meltdown. It was not due to the fact that he didn't get the soda, it is the fact that he never makes what I say priority in his mind. This kind of thing happens ***all*** the time.

I texted him and just went off. He went through the same old, ""Im sorry I just forgot"". I just wouldn't take it. He said he was worried with the way I was reacting and I told him I had already done everything he was worried about, which is self harm. I had been having things build up for a while, and once again my period was involved. It also came yesterday so that probably did not help anything.

This breakdown was something else. I did not cut too much, but I had sat there in a daze of dark thoughts and blankness for so long that my blood had dried and stuck to the towel that my arm was laying on.

Skip to half a day later, the roommate came home. Things were fine til we waltzed over and just berated me with all this is the span of about 2-3 minutes.

""Shouldn't you be reading, playing a game or ***colorinngg?""*** I was actually organizing some pages I had not finished coloring at that moment. He walked up to me and said, ""Are you even going to finish any of those? What do you not like coloring living things? And what is this (points to my computer background) a still shot? ""

I told him yeah its a still shot from a Ghibli film and his response, ""Well DUH!""

All in the span of 2-3 minutes. I just felt attacked. He left the room after saying all that and I just said fuck it and went to the bathroom and completely torn up my arm. The worst I have in months.

I just do not understand why people treat me like I am just something they fuck with. Something that is not worth the memory space in their brain to remember things I ask or say. I am never priority to any one.

I am getting more scared of myself because I realized last night that cutting is helping more than I actually even knew. I normally use it as a mood stabilizer to keep me from actually being violent with someone, and just because no one wants to have break downs and feel that way. Well I realized yesterday that I am much more suicidal when I try not to cut myself. All the times I have tried to refrain from self harm I have had really bad affects. One time I actually thought that I might have needed medical attention but just decided to sleep on it.

I am mainly feeling bad because I sound ridiculous. Having a break down stemmed from my bf not bringing me soda? That is stupid. But I feel bad because I cannot help the way I respond to things. As much as I hate myself for responding the way I do to somethings sometimes, I can not help it. I cannot. And it makes me feel worse that people think that I am just being dramatic or looking for attention. I am not. I am just frustrated and suicidal (only during break downs and such).I do not know why he is even still with me and dealing with me. I am such a shitty person.

I do not know what to do about this since it will be a while before I can save to even attempt seeing a professional..

172,"Never again.

I tried being honest and told everyone how I felt over time and even detailed my plan of making them hte me just enough to not permanently scar them. Here are the results.

My ""best friend"" hates me and won't talk to me because he sees this as me manipulating him for some homoerotic agenda when he knows full and damn well I don't swing that way.

My ""friends"" from high school and work have all stopped talking to me except for the people at work who have to communicate with me because I'm an IT. Though that's nothing new because i could never get anyone of them to talk to me unless they had to anyway.

My family was the worst though. My one cousin got angry at me and tried to strangle me, told me nobody wants me here and then lied to everyone saying I threatened to hurt him and my sister. My parents freak out at the slightest symptom and threaten to send me off to a ward when the time I went willingly was absolutely useless.

I literally only get social interaction outside of work from dating. That's it. I'm stuck where i am and nobody trusts me or wants me around enough to even talk to me.

I(f26) have always struggled socially and creating lasting friendships. I have many acquaintances but   very few friends that I am close with and the friends I do have I struggle to keep for a long period of time. 

Then I was thinking about my parents behaviour when I was growing up and feel like that sort of made me who I am socially, unfortunately. My mom was always on the quieter side and though she had a few friends that we would visit she rarely had people over. Then there was my dad who was a big source of embarrassment for my sister and I as children/teens. He had very few friends and would just act and say inappropriate things at inappropriate times that would make everyone uncomfortable. We’d be out for social events with family or friends and I’d have my cousin or whomever come up and tell me “you’re dads kinda weird eh?” or my boyfriends parents remark on my dads behaviour and mannerisms which caused me shame. In public and with strangers my dad would sometimes just start talking differently, as if he had an accent and in this really soft, low voice that he never normally spoke in and for me as a kid that was really weird and made me uncomfortable. We were once at an event for my moms work and my mom introduced my family to two of her coworkers who were sisters and my dad looks at one of them and asks “oh are you her mom?” Even though they appeared very similar in age and then of course my mom would be embarrassed and so would my sister and I and also feel bad for my mom. 
I never wanted to go out for dinner as a family, or be with my dad in public because I knew something embarrassing would happen. 

And now I feel like I never developed socially enough because I didn’t have good exposure to what normal social interactions were like. I feel like I’m permanently damaged.

I have no memory of what happens after 3/23/2018 and I think my boyfriend is my ex and I’m confused and disoriented since I just moved. I act like how I was back then— very carefree compared to now and just wanting to drink all the time. Last time it happened this memory loss thingy didn’t happen but I acted really childish... my boyfriend said it’s almost like I’m a different person. Sometimes I even reenact past memories like I say the exact same things and do the exact same things that I did during my suicide attempt in 2018. But I still know that this isn’t right. The only problem is it’s like my body is running on autopilot and I’ve just become a passenger. Sometimes my hand starts choking me and I have no control over it. One time I started hurting myself. It’s very uncomfortable. I would be crying hard but then suddenly I stop crying and start smiling and talking in this immature manner. 

About 3 weeks ago I kept switching back and forth (sometimes within minutes) for a few days. My psychiatrist had no idea what was going on and she was afraid it might be something neurological, but it could also just be stress related (college student haha), She said I should go to the psych ER. At the ER, I could tell the doctor didn’t believe me. He said that being admitted to a psych unit will not solve all my problems — in fact, I may stay there for a good while since my case is so weird.

I’d never felt more invalidated when he read my file and said “Sounds like something out of a movie, huh?”

 I told him I’ve been admitted 6 times before I was finally diagnosed with bipolar and got the right meds and I really really didn’t want to be admitted again. I told them about the neurological stuff but they didn’t do anything. Nobody knows what it is. Fortunately I was released after a few hours. My discharge paper said “Anxiety disorder, unspecified.”  It’s gotten better since I’ve been trying to stress less, but it’s still happening and I really don’t want to deal with this. 

I guess I’m asking if there’s anybody who has gone through something like this.. at least so I can get some idea of what might be happening. Thank you for your help.",11Nov2019,1
191,"I've struggled with mental health in the past but it's never been this bad before.

I'm failing classes because I really don't care about what I'm being taught and I have no passion for my career or future in general. The people I think of as my ""main friends"" are trying to distance themselves from me, so my social life is practically dead. 

Nothing I used to like doing is fun anymore and I seem to be slower and less alive than I usually am, sleeping for long periods of time and eating too much.

Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated.",11Nov2019,1

193,"Hello i apology from the begginig for any typo i might do english is not my first langage but i'll try...

So i'm pretty young like almost 18y.o and i have a severe lack of emotion and a lack of self confidence as deep as a endless hole and the cake on the cherry is that i'm utturly negative or stoic when i am (i don't show when i'm mentaly in pain and so on and so forth). And i'l the type whi always question myself like ""why did i say that ?"" 
Or ""why am i even here ?"" And this since 6 years

I'm very strong at faking thing like the fact that i'm happy, self confident and so on but in fact i'm not even happyor sad. I'm slowly going into depression and the only things that help me is being with my friend but then i happen to be an introvert and having social interaction plus the fact that i have to fake every single emotion is very tiring and the fact that i know what i want to do in life.
So if you have some advice on how to be more self confident or if you are experiencing the same situation it'll help me a lot to know that i'l not alone.
Also i dont tell my friend because i know it's boring and it's a negative subject and people don't like negetivity.

Thx if this post end up being seen.",11Nov2019,1

195,"I stopped taking fluoxetine (Prozac) when I graduated 6 months ago, but recently I have felt myself spiralling into my old train of thought and impulsiveness. I stopped taking them because I was tired of feeling ""reserved"" and empty; and I had finished my schooling. Now I'm trying to work two jobs (with a third teaching job after Christmas) and I need to be ""in control"" of my life. It was a big decision for me to come off them and I coped well for the first few months. I did therapy alongside the meds before but I have since moved city and I don't have time for sessions.

I don’t like her at all but I do small things like touching her hand and sitting close to her because I know it makes her like me more. I don’t think it’s for the attention, it’s more to do with enjoying manipulating her. Why do I feel like this? She’s bisexual and she knows I’m a lesbian, I don’t know if that’s relevant just giving context. Also, sometimes I think I’m making it up that she likes me but other times she does stuff that makes me think she does. For example, calling me sexy and hinting at us getting together.",11Nov2019,1

I've tried to find support from a significant other but every time I've tried that I get hurt in the end and it feels like my therapist is the only one that listens but I know its because I pay them to and I know that the availability for them to listen is about once a month. the one person I mildly trusted to talk to is now dating one of my best friends even though both of them knew i had a history with the girl and its super painful to see that shit.

200,"i feel obligated to self harm in response to thoughts of not having it bad enough i feel so bad if i dont do it and the way i do it (hitting myself) feels fake because it's not serious i've never sent myself to the hospital it's pathetic and not even a real problem and am making it all up.

i have sudden thoughts of other people's mental suffering and it reminds me that i actually have no real problems and am just insulting other people's experiences by thinking i could ever even say i've struggled with mental illness. i keep debating this with myself in my head making points and counterpoints and comparisons and researching. every single media i've consumed for a couple months now is chosen exclusively on the fact that i can use it as a measure to compare my own pain and understand if its real or not. i can at least safely say that i think about mental illness 24/7.

if im not actively researching it im watching something that reminds me of it, reading comments on it to check what other people think, i think about it while i do every single other thing in my life i think about it while i talk to people while i eat while i write while im talking about something else.

i clearly never had it that bad because i never had any extreme behaviors if i was neglected it's because i wasn't suffering for real, i even failed at being a shut in, i dont injure myself enough i dont have enough panic attacks my compulsions didnt impair my functioning enough i even failed at dropping out of college despite struggling at it and hating it, i hate every single thing that ive ever done every activity every achievement every good grade every successful interaction because they're a reminded that i've always faked and still do and that i never had it bad enough to justify calling myself mentally ill or to even say that i ever struggled at all.

those thoughts of other people's suffering are so painful and remind me that everything ive been through is normal and i should have never even gone to therapy, the fact that i decided to go is even more proof that clearly i didnt have it bad enough or i wouldnt have been able to do that.

i feel so guilty for not self harming and more seriously right now i feel even more fake because this is the reason why i feel bad and i feel guilty because for wishing that my harm obsessions would come back so i wouldnt feel so fake.

all of this sounds so dramatic but the truth is that i didnt even cry so im exaggerating this as well. i even failed at starving myself for a day.

today i took a notebook and divided a page in obsessions and compulsions and listed every single one ive had since childhood until now so maybe id feel better but the reassurance was so weak and only lasted until now when the thought of another acquaintance who's been forced to drop out because of anxiety and was institutionalized popped in my head again and the whole train of thought started again.

im in therapy and supposed to give ACT a try but im terrified that if this goes away and i truly feel better then i'll have completely faked my suffering. feeling good is a trigger for thoughts about faking. if i have a good day it's proof that im not suffering or i wouldnt have any good days.",11Nov2019,1
201,"This is my first ever post and I really feel like I just need to vent because I don't have anyone I can talk to about this. I'm a second year college now and this is really sad but I feel like I have no actual friends here. I wasn't always like this and I had many close friends in high school but something has just seemed off since my senior year of high school and I feel as if I just can't connect properly with others. I feel scared to show off any true personality and tend to just be extremely neutral in conversations which makes me somewhat ""liked"" by everyone but doesn't allow for me to make and true connections. I got really into self improvement last summer to overcome this strange social anxiety and read some Mark Manson as well as some seduction stuff really just as a way to try and jumpstart my confidence and to allow me to express my true self more. I actually made some progress that summer and was feeling really good for a bit, but now I'm back in college and I'm living alone with no friends here and it's just been really hard to motivate myself to continue with these habits. I set up a whole self-improvement guide for myself, with daily tasks to compete such as working out, meditating, journaling, and chatting with strangers/girls (which was terrifying but actually really fun while I did it). Now I feel like I can't just walk up to girls or strangers because I'm in a small college town and I'm scared I'll mess up badly and see them again every day. I feel like I need the anonymity of a large city to be able to overcome this social/mental barrier by just talking to strangers and failing over and over without any repercussions, but I feel trapped in my university with my current personality right now. It has now been about two months since I returned to college and I have made no significant process in my social goals, which I believe is causing me to feel depressed. I just feel really lost because I really do want to change and improve my life and learn how to live without caring what others think of me but I know the only way to achieve this is by taking action (which I'm not doing right now). I just feel really lonely because of my situation which is causing me to feel depressed and unmotivated which sucks because the only way to get out of this is by finding the motivation to change. I know this might not make any sense but I feel like i'm just on a downward spiral because the more days that go by without me taking action, the more disappointed in myself and depressed I feel which makes it even harder to take action. I don't even know what I'm asking or what I want but I just need some motivation to get out of this rut.",11Nov2019,1
202,"I'm 21 years old and I've been struggling with anxiety for about 2.5 months now.

About 2 years ago, I would smoke marijuana about twice a week (I only had this habit for about 2 months). Never had any anxiety or panic attacks. One day I had an extremely bad panic attack and decided to never smoke weed again. Things went back perfectly to normal. I didn't touch it until 3 months ago. 3 months ago I made a terrible decision thinking that the bad trip was a one off thing. I had a repeat of the first panic attack, probably worse. I experienced delusions and extreme paranoia about existentialism, I won't go into detail but it was very scary.

I was pretty shaken up for about a week, things seemed off, but not too bad. About a week afterwards, however, something triggered a panic attack while I was completely sober. I felt like some of the delusions came back, I was in a state where to an extent some part of me believed the crazy thoughts, and I was really scared, It was almost as bad as the weed trip. Ever since the sober panic attack, I haven't been able to stop thinking about all of this for even an hour of the day. Since then I have had about 2 more panic attacks, although they have reduced in severity. Even when I'm not in a panic attack, sometimes I just feel bad, and I feel anxious that this issue won't ever go away. I haven't had a panic attack in 2 weeks, and feelings of derealization have reduced in that time as well.

I can't imagine living the rest of my life this way. I stopped watching movies out of fear something will trigger my anxiety. I only watch a few channels on youtube that I know won't trigger my anxiety every night before bed to get my mind off of this so that I can fall asleep. Sometimes in public a song I hear or a conversation someone has will make me anxious and I have to leave the room. I haven't even been listening to music because my brain sometimes likes to pick up on ""metaphors"" or coincidences that make me worry.

So, things have definitely gotten better over the past few weeks. During the day I have a lot less anxiety, I think this is because both of the bad trips happened during the night and so my brain is more on edge during the night. I also haven't had any derealization the past 2 weeks. But things are still far from normal, I have to avoid practically all media out of fear of a panic attack. The reason I put PTSD in the title is because some of the symptoms sound similar.

P.S. I have no history of anxiety, panic attacks, or any disorders my entire life. I'm really hoping this issue will come to a close and I will be back to normal. The point of this post is to ask have any of you had similar experiences? Do you think things will go back to normal for me?

203,"I feel like I have forgot my purpose in life and I don't know what my next step should be.

My life was not pleasant. My childhood and my teenage years haunt me to this day. I was utterly humiliated,estranged and shamed for so many things. For my body,my way of thinking,my sexuality,my hobbies - everything that had to do with me. And despite working on myself, despite having worked very hard, despite befriending many of the people that hurt me, my memories are still haunting me to this day. They have ruined my happy moments. They take my attention away from things that I should be focusing. They have caused me **major** trust issues and I can't make friends easily anymore. I can't develop loving relationships and I feel extreme pressure.

Even if I went through many hardships,I managed to get to a good university with some wonderful teachers and college students. It has been 2 months since I began studying in it. But I am starting to lose my will to contact either of these. Everytime I attend lectures,I try to give them my all, but on the inside I feel like it's never enough. To the point of severe exhaustion when working on assignments and when attending lectures. Because I so desperately wish to become successful in my life,I try to work as much as I can. And for this reason,I have distanced myself from other people in an attempt to focus on my studies. I feel very unhappy. And very lost.

I want my future job to be something that the world needs,something that I love and am good at,something that will let me live a comfortable life. But I don't know if I am on the right path. I feel like I am sinking in a vast ocean.
