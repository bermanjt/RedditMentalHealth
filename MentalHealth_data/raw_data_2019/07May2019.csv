I started sleeping less, losing weight, feeling lost and most of the time powerless like someone took every emotion from me, like someone took everything from me

And im just afraid to even try to build up everything again, because this time it feels like i may even fail, i could build everything and make it all good just to lose it again and this time...it feels like i can t even try anymore, it s hard

4,"I'm not diagnosed with any mental health disorder (I've never seen a psychologist/psychiatrist/therapist), but I do self harm, have intrusive thoughts, and have had a history of suicide attempts. I've been going through a pretty long bout of depression for the last 2 years or so, but I often feel like it's ""fake"" because it's punctuated by, usually very short (an hour or two tops), periods of relative tranquility. Sometimes that tranquility goes beyond though and becomes periods of over-excitement.  

  

The worst time this happened, by far, was last year. I was home alone for a week in order to surprise my girlfriend when she came back from a trip she was on, since we date long distance and she expected me to be back in school already. I passed the time watching an anime about superheroes and became convinced, for about two days, that I had latent superpowers, and if I just did some minimal workout I would be able to develop super speed and super strength. Suffice to say I went on a one-hour run around town, woke up the next day with my legs killing me, and decided that I was not, in fact, a superhuman. (Just to be clear: I was 18 at the time, so it wasn't just some childish fancy.)  

  

I haven't really had any events close to that level of madness since then (except earlier this year when I suddenly decided that my depression wasn't real and decided I would become president of the U.S., which is impossible, since I was born outside the country). I did have a strange episode earlier today though. I was feeling fairly depressed last night--I couldn't get any work done, had a panic attack while talking on the phone with my gf, and then self harmed--until I went to sleep. The moment my head hit the pillow, my mind started zooming all over the place, and I decided that I'd give a four hour lecture in a few weeks time on literary readings of the Bible. Not only that: my new approach to reading the Bible in this manner would be so revolutionary that I'd publish it as a book. Sample sentences raced into and out of my head for about an hour as I lay in bed. Then it continued into this morning: I have 2 finals tomorrow and 1 the day after that I'm wholly unprepared for, but I spent 2 hours writing and researching for the first 7 pages of said book. After that, my energy began to peter out and I recognized that I needed to study.  

  

Is this mania? Is it hypomania? I tend to think of the ""superpowers"" event as a manic episode, just because I don't really know how else to explain it. There's a similar feeling of my mind racing, but the severity is clearly very different.",07May2019,1
5,"I have suffered depression since I was a child. Diagnosed as bipolar and no one understands this disease. People close to me are embarrassed of me because I always ""look"" pissed off and miserable. Am told that people are tired of dealing with me. Damn.

6,"Background: moderate depression, very low self-esteem, I need to increase SSRI medication every spring, absolutely cannot manage summers without meds, could manage winters off-meds.

Every time I have to increase my medication I get these weird symptoms. I suddenly start feeling absent, my thinking slows down, my short-term memory basically goes nonexistent and my brain starts to ""buzz"". Buzz is a really good word for it, it feels slightly electrical, like something soft and fluffy would be petting my brain. When I get this, I also get hypersensitive to loud sounds, certain frequencies and sudden unexpected movements and will get every time a ""brain zap"" when I hear or see something I didn't expect (notification sound or ad popping on screen). When I get this brain zap, my eyes tend to do a jerking motion to the left and immediately return where I was watching and I will feel like I might lose consciousness (never had though). Sometimes I will see a white flash or get ""electric shock"" through my body when there is this ""zap"". This will happen most days approximately once but especially when I'm in the buzzing mode it can happen close to 50 times. I don't really hear the buzzing. When I have this ""mode"", I never feel depressed, my brain feels ""glad"" but I feel like I'm being really weird because I don't mind staring a wall without moving for 10 minutes and letting my thoughts flow. Working or studying is really difficult while these buzzing attacks.

Does this sound familiar to you guys? Could it be only the meds or is there something (physically) wrong with me as well? I'd love to read about similar stories if you have them!",07May2019,4
7,"I started on Mirtazapine 15mg in February after coming off Venlafaxine because of the stimulating effect worsening my anxiety. I moved up to 30mg after two weeks and my mood felt like it was lifting and my appetite improved. 

Since April, both my mood and my appetite have steadily declined till now where I'm back where I was before. I barely eat and I'm typing this after waking up from 2 hours of sleep and I'm back to feeling hopeless. (I haven't been able to hold down a job since my diagnosis and don't feel very hopeful that I'll be able to find anything). 

I was discharged from the home treatment team and am now under the care of a community link worker and a work &amp; health programme case worker, but I don't feel like they're helping. They've acknowledged the difficulties I have, but don't seem to be trying to address them. 

I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do now. I feel like I've exhausted all of my options, I don't have anything that even resembles a support network and I've resigned myself to living in the box room at my parent's house in absolute squalor and isolation because life is just so bleak. 

Where do I go from here?",07May2019,1
8," Not sure if this belongs here. This is a throwaway account due to unrelated reasons. 

&amp;#x200B;

 My mental mishaps start around the time I was in 5th grade, when my parents got divorced. My parents gave the normal talk about how they still loved us and wasn't our fault, that they just didn't love each other anymore and thought is was best to spend some time apart. As this was announced my sister did not cry, she just sat there quietly which I would later find out was her way of suppressing the emotions for later. I on the other hand had tears streaming down my face every drop causing me to go farther down into a pit of emotions. Though after that first spirt of emotions I just took them all and locked them away and box in a drawer which was in a desk in a safe and I left. 

 So, life went on and I moved out of my childhood home a rather large house with a big backyard into my dad's new small rental house with these odd teekies in the front yard, while my mother figured out where she would buy a new house. When I walked into my dad's house for the first time I was surprised, though not in a good way. There were boxes everywhere with all his junk in it along with an empty kitchen with a smelly old pantry and janky fridge (both were empty). After seeing that I thought it couldn't get worse I mean my bedroom can't be that bad. I walked over to my room and all that was there was a twin bed and empty white space that felt as if it hadn't been touched for centuries. The next week I came home from a visit to my mom to see that twin bed gone replaced with a bunk bed with only a top bunk and underneath there was a carpet, bean bag, tv mounted to the wall, and best of all an Xbox. I ran down the hall to my father thanking him profusely where he just smiled and said, ""Thomas and I picked this stuff up while you were gone because we thought your room seemed a little dull."" My delight would soon turn to sadness. My sister came home from school and all she did was yell at me and with pure hatred in her eyes she ripped my tv off the wall and let it fall to the ground. I never found out why she did such a thing, but I think she was angry that she didn't get a tv.

 Not much went on at my mom's new place. By the time she got her house I was used to a small house and was not surprised when I saw it. My sister didn't act up at that house ,so at least I felt safe from a constant onslaught of words there with my mother shielding me from her hate taking it on all by herself. Since then I have always hated myself for not even lifting a finger trying to help the situation, but at the time I didn't understand or even know how to deal with a situation like that. 

 Fast-forward a year and my dad has a house of his own. He is a very well off man making upwards of 6 digits a year. The house he bought was in the most expensive neighborhood in Austin. I loved the new house, but as time went on my sister fell into a deep hole of drugs and anger while I retained mental damage from her as my father went through a midlife crises. When my father was going through this change he seemed to forget I existed along with my sister. First a regular supply of food stopped coming, then dinner stopped coming completely as well as breakfast. I would only have lunch at school that he made for me because he had to keep his public image up. The only time I would ever get dinner was when he brought home guests and once again he had to keep his public image safe, so he made dinner and acknowledged that I existed. I would be forced to put on an act for his new friends because in my head I thought there wouldn't be any lunch if I didn't act like a normal kid. I especially couldn't have the school lunches because I was almost deathly allergic to wheat and dairy which is in everything. Eventually he started giving my sister his credit card so that we could go shopping and get food for ourselves. I was a kid, so all I did was buy junk food that I would eat in massive amounts causing me to develop an eating disorder where I would constantly eat. Even today I am still stuck in that loop of eating and eating and eating. The mental issues with the tension of home life just kept building and building on itself and those emotions that I locked away, so long ago started seeping out until the safe blew open overloaded with emotions and mental stress. So, I went further into that pit that had now turned into a black hole eating up everything in sight. I was sent into deep depression which I'm still enveloped in, even now.

 The year is now 2019 and I'm still suffering from all these issues and mental stress that keeps building up. I am currently only 15, so I still have more time stuck in this place, but when I get out I hope my life can change for the better.",07May2019,1
9,"I am having a bad period of mental health in terms of depression and anxiety and am also under circumstantial stress.

During the times when I feel really low, he always asks me if there’s anything he can do to help, and I always say nothing because I never know what to say or what would make either of us feel better. 

Does anyone have some ideas because I feel like if I say something simple he could do to help me that isn’t a lot of effort for him it would make us both feel better. But I never know.

10,"Hi. I’m new here. I looked around for people like me and haven’t found many yet so I guess I’m just reaching out to someone who can relate. 

Anywho...here’s my story:

I’ve always been depressed. I just thought that was who I was. However, one day about 2 years ago, I started experiencing a visitor. He started at smoke in corners of my room. He switcheroo’ed it up on me and turned into smoke coming from under my doors. Eventually he turned into a man who to this day has never let me see his face.
He started off kind and caring. It was nice to have someone who cared about me so deeply even though I knew he wasn’t real. He hugged me. And made me feel safe. But he slowly became more demanding. Commanding me to hurt myself. That it would be fun and then we could go to sleep. He cared about me. He wanted me to be with him. Every now and then he would tell me how I could end it all and we could run away in the sunset together. 
He stayed like this for about a year. My daily visitor. 
He never gave me his name. I refer to him as “the man”
the man came along with birds chirping and touches. The hugs weren’t enough I suppose. 
As he became more demanding I became more vulnerable to his wishes. 
After the second year came around he would put his hands on mine and tell me how I have to hurt myself or do something to kill myself. Usually this was when I was driving. Driving into a ravine. Driving into a semi. Etc. these were his favorites. 
I went to get help through work and was punished and shunned. Told I wasn’t adequate for my job because I’m sick. Wasn’t put up for awards because “I’m not going to be around much longer anyway”.

I knew I had to get help when I was staying with my brother who was living on the 18th floor of an apartment building at the time. He (the man) was very adamant about me jumping. I wanted to. He wanted me to. It was just a jump a way. One jump and we could be together. 

The day I got back home I was admitted into a mental hospital for 3 months of trying medications and pretty intense therapy. 

He was quiet. But like in the past when I thought about figuring out how to get rid of him he’d get pissed. When he gets pissed I can feel it in every fiber of my being. But when I was on meds and he came back it was torture. I’m talking full breakdown. Very suicidal. Totally over the man. 

But now I’m stable. Medication is important. Medication is a good thing. 
I live in fear every day that he will come back. I fear my reaction. I fear his anger. 

But I’m not just depressed me anymore. I feel happy and angry and anxious and excited and have a will to live for the first time in a long time. I still have feelings of suicidality. 
Even with the negative emotions, I find myself grateful. medication is important. Consistency is important. 

I’m not romanticizing my mental health. This is just my story.",07May2019,10
11,"Sometimes I just feel so disconnected from what I see and what's going on. I've been into cars the majority of my life, and this last weekend I got the opportunity to see some of the cars Ive always loved but never got to see before, and meet one of my favourite YouTubers. I went to this big event with a huge grin on my face and I left feeling just... Disconnected and neutral. I saw this project car I had been following online for months and it just felt... Like nothing. All these cars Ive always wanted to see up close in person, and it felt like I was looking through a screen and it felt so distant even though I was 2 feet away from it.

12,"I’m bipolar and my worst symptom (both manic and depressive, somehow) is sex addiction. I know it sounds stupid but it’s almost debilitating. Work nights, strangers, STDs. 


I have no issue talking about anything else in therapy but it got to the point where I knew i had to bring it up and I was having panic attacks and extreme anxiety so I just quit therapy instead. I make a joke out of it with my friends which encourages me to just keep on keeping on but i know how awful that is for me. 


I’ve done independent research and there’s not a single underlying root cause for this that I can pinpoint myself. Great childhood, loving parents, no trauma, no sexual assault (until years after I had been living with this), never been cheated on, nothing but love and support. I just can’t bring myself to talk about it seriously. I’m so ashamed and when I try to admit out loud how destructive it is it’s like I physically can’t speak.

13,"And if I'm not, is there any other mental illness that sounds like it fits my description?

Some backstory first, it's going to be messy and ranty.

I'm currently a 21 year old man.

Basically I was bullied as a kid, up until I was around 16. Not very extreme bullying, mainly excluding me from things. But it took me several years to realise not everyone was out to hurt me once I let me guard down. 

I've always felt like I can't get very close to people. I struggle to care for friends, and even very close friends and or family. I have yet to have a friend or family member I care about die, so I've yet to experience how a death of someone close to me will affect me, and I'm kinda worried that I just won't care.
______________
I never feel like I truly can be loved by close friends, even though plenty of people have told me they do. 

I worry that I just kind of have gotten too content with being on my own. I can be very social, and function well in stressful situations. I can take leader roles in social functions etc, and I can make people feel included, as I hated being excluded when I was a kid.

My problem is that I just can't *feel*

I can't feel that pain when someone backstabs me.

I can't feel like I'm missing someone when they eventually have to leave for extended periods of time. 

Maybe it's becuase I always have this feeling in the back of my head that it's going to happen anyway, so I might as well not get attached.

___

Music is the only thing that really gives me the ability to really *feel* emotions, as well as extreme sports with high risk and big amounts of adrenaline. This is why my life mainly resorts around extremesports, music, sleep and gaming.

____

I worry that I'm a narcissist, because it feels like the only thing I can truly care about is myself. I feel like I can't care about my close friends because they will eventually let me down.

I function as a very regular person, and you wouldn't know I felt this way if you saw me in person. I ""pretend"" (not really the word I'm looking for because I do truly care about some people, just not as much as it might seem) to care deeply about certain situations. 

_____

The main reason I write this post is because I've been looking for a serious relationship my whole life. There is going to be some bragging in the next few sentences to put a perspective on my life.

I have plenty of good friends that care about me. I am quite attractive. I'm have interesting hobbies. I'm currently studying so my financial situation won't be the centerpoint for most peoples relationships. I'm great at caring for other people,(complimenting them, favours, invitations to events, etc etc.) and everything I do is usually recipocrated, happily, not as a ""oh he did something nice, I guess I'll do it to him too"".

Okay, now that I've spent 6 lines bragging about myself you would see why I'd want to be someone you would like to be friends with and date. And I do have a fair amount of friends, maybe 6 or 7 of them would consider me some of their closest friends.

Yet I feel alone. I feel like I don't really care about them, and they don't really care about me. It feels like they are all pretending to like me, just for the convenience of it.

Yes I'm insecure. Not in my looks, not in my ability to be a good friend, not in my ability to be a good person, but simply in the fact that I feel like nobody truly likes me, even though all signs tell me otherwise. The only person I can be comfortable with is myself, and I want **so** desperately to be comfortable with others.

At some point we were gonna kiss but we didn’t. There was so much chemistry. And we were so comparable. 
He enjoyed the silence just as much as I did. Our perspective on vital things were the same.  I felt very safe and free. I felt so myself win him. 
And I felt that feeling in my stomach. 

We said we’d probably never see each other again. It was just a visit. 

I went forward knowing that however I haven’t stopped thinking about him. 
I’ve now been offered a job opportunity in the area he lives in and I accepted it.

With all this, I had also just ended a relationship. Exactly two weeks ago. Yes it is very early but it didn’t feel wrong. The relationship ended because we haven’t been in love for the past 2 years.

17,"I've been taking prescribed medications (SSRI) for several years. Gradually adjusting the types, dosage, mixtures, timing, and method with a team of health professionals. Paired with other forms of interventions including meditation, exercise, group and one-on-one therapy sessions (eg. Cognitive, and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing), my progress was moving in a healthy direction. I ultimately like I had a pretty good grasp on my situation and had come to terms with the less admirable parts of myself.
 
However, every now and again I forget to take my medication. This is when things go sour... When I forget the first dose, I don't notice but my subconscious might. I evidently forget the next, and this perpetuates a spiral that I am still unaware of. The more I miss, the more likely I am to miss. My days blend and life become vague and blurry. I am disassociated from my regular self and unaware of it. That is until I begin to feel the physical withdrawals of being off the medication. My lips feel icy cold, my body shakes, my heart flutters, and electric shocks randomly through my limps. An irrational, pathetic, self-loathing kind of sadness consumes my consciousness. It's torture. It is painful. It's also really difficult to explain it to loved one that I am both okay and not, just that I am very sick at that moment. This moment. 

I know that feeling this way is not my normal. So I take my medication again and pray I never forget again.

19,"I'm writing this in personal theory and the sudden feeling that I'm actually semi-delusional.
I'm 29 years old. This is just venting about some stuff I've been feeling and thinking recently. Im trying to get out of my comfort zone and dont much like writing about things. 
But I would be interested if anyone has had smilar experiances.

I've recently been seeing a tharapist to work though some mild depression, childhood trama and possible suppressed rage issues.
My tharapist thinks I disassociate as a coping mechanism.

As a result I'm trying to be more present and aware of my thoughts and emotions. I have become more aware that I have a terrible habbit of what i thought up until recently was astro-projecting. It sounds silly to write it out and that maybe why I haven't told anyone especially not my doctor about it.

I realize now that Ive likely been dissasociating from and depersonalizing the world around me. I've been living in a delusion of astral-projection due to tiny false coincidences I've told myself we're evidence. Most of it has really just been me rationalizing my dissociation into something as unrealistic as an out of body experiance. 

But also with that realization it is very hard to keep myself conciousnesly grounded to reality for a full 24hrs. Especially when I'm alone. 

I have a normal job, and am in a semi-healthy long term relationship. I have a group friends whom I've started to feel more disconnected with recently (which one of many reason i seeked out tharapy in the first place.) But for all intents and purposes my life is relatively normal and I do a good job fitting in.

When I am alone, relaxed, or destressing I tend to drift. I lose track of my thoughts and feelings my breathing slows like I'm going to sleep. It almost feels like I lose track of my body as well and I'm floating above it. Thats the only way to describe it. It feels like nothing, just peaceful, thoughtless existence. Im floating in the room above myself, my body sits still and its like i'm not in my head anymore. 
The amount of time i spend like this is relative to how stimulating the enviornment around me is. 

If someone talks to me it takes me a second to come back, like resurfacing from under water. They usually have to repeat what they were saying. I used to think it was my thoughts that tethered me to my body but i realize now that may just be part of my delusion. 

When my partner and I are watching movies or reading or having any non-focused or involved time together I drift will drift away. She gets so upset with me that I dont seem to be paying attention to the movie or show or making progress in the book that I'm reading. It is becoming disruptive in my life. I try to explain to my partner that we are relaxing and thats how i relax but she obviously wants me present and it causes tension between us. This part I did try to explain to my tharapist. She said that the feeling of nothing and inability to be present is actually rage.

So now I'm attempting to work through my rage, but its hard when you feel litterally nothing. I try to calm myself down and make peace with my demons but I keep ending up in a dissasociated place above my own head. I lose track of what i'm angry at and it doesnt seem important anymore when i come back. Nothing does, everything just feels fine and insignificant in hindsight. Then i feel like I've gotten lost in a delusion and made zero progress in healing myself. 

My mother, who causes the most upset in my life used to confirm this to me. She'd say I'd be upset about things, litterally check out for a few minuites and be fine. Ive always done it. I almost think its impossible for me not to. Tramatic things have happened, I can choose to be present and take action or I can check out entirely. I passed it off in my teens and young adult as possible out of body experiances and just left it at that. 

I thought it was out of body experiances because sometimes I get the feeling Im leaving the room. I get the delusion that I was moving through the house or the neighborhood. Sometimes shadowing my family, roommates or partners. I would hear their conversations, see their clothes, be almost thoughtlessly aware of my surroundings and later. If later I saw them and could confirm they were wearing the same thing, or watching the same thing or that a friend had infact dropped by while I was out. I would take these tiny, and probably obvious, correct predictions as proof that i had had an out of body experiance.  More semi-delusional ""evidance.""

I also feel like i remember before i was born. I've had this memory for as long as i can remember. I remember parts of ""my last life"" then floating. The thoughtless existance. I remember floating over my own body in my bed as a baby then i was in my body with no memory of the day before, yet i knew who everyone was. As a child i insisted this was my first memory. It added to the normality. I realize now that's absurd and unrealistic.

As I have stated before I'm having a very hard time staying present. I've been going over my past and things that stress me out and when askes to write about it I was stimulated enough to go over the stress with out slipping away. I became overwhelmingly angry at my parents for my childhood. It was the first actual and concrete feeling I've felt in years. It was overwhelming but i held onto it. It started messing with my sleep so I let myself slip away. I'm still uneasy about it but it doesnt feel like it matters anymore.

I keep trying to write it down. To re-experiance that anger again but I can't. I have so much anger inside of me but I cant feel any of it. I can't feel much of anything. I feel anger when I talk about growing up to my psycologist but no matter how hard i try to feel that again at home i fail. What I do feel and can't escape is fear, I fear the future, growing old and my partner suddenly and inexplicably dying. 

Now I suddenly fear this void that used to bring me so much peace and comfort. I find myself sitting at home and suddenly realizing i slipped away. The second i realize it I'm back in my body but I can't relax, if I do I'll slip back. Sometimes im gone untul someone comes home and shakes me out of it or if i have something I need to do ill set alarms to keep myself grounded. 

Latelt I've been counting things around me just to stay grounded. 80 keys on my keyboard, 29 teeth and 3 implants in my mouth, 6 holes in my belt, 7 zippers on my backpack. 

Am I driving myself crazy or was I always a bit off? Is it worse now? I used to not think much at all, but since Ive been trying to be more present my mind is racing. 

My partner says i've always been fine save for when i check out in the evenings. Either way somethings missing and the most obvious place to start is this thoughtless existence that I cling so tightly too.",07May2019,1

I received the form in the mail.  I had just made the first doctor's apt for myself in three years.  You know how daunting it can be to make an appointment with the doctor.  Regardless, I knew I needed to do it on a good day.  I didn't feel like doing anything on my bad days.  Then I got the form.

&amp;#x200B;

It had the usual questions:  Basic Information, specific symptoms I want to look into etc. Then I flipped it over, and I found the section I had been both dreading and hoping for.  The section about Mental Health symptoms.  We all know the stigma of admitting Mental Health issues, the fear of crossing a our own personal Rubicon.  Will this follow me forever?  If I admit I'm occasionally suicidal could they hospitalize me then and there?  Our imagination is our own worst enemy.  Despite all this, I made the choice to be honest. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I do experience feeling of hopelessness or despair.  

Yes, I do think about or plan suicide

Yes, I do feel symptoms of Depression multiple times in a two week period

&amp;#x200B;

I thought, after I was done, that I had been too brutal.  That on my good days I didn't feel that bad, but that's what I always told myself.  The good days were always fine, Id even sometimes forget the darkness.  It was always there though, never too far.  I didn't change the form.

&amp;#x200B;

I made the appointment for after work, and it was a particularly stressful day so when I had left it was almost a relief.  This was until the nerves kicked in.  I had my forms in my pocket the whole day of work, and I felt like at any second they could fall out and reveal who I was to the outside.  Still, they didn't, and no one knew.  I drove to the doctor and as I was driving my anxiety started.  When I entered the building and checked in, I forced a smile.  We all know forced smiles are the bread and butter of hiding true feelings.  I handed the papers over to get them out of my hands, and the receptionist handed them back; the form was for the doctor.  When my name was called to follow the nurse, I wasn't ready.

&amp;#x200B;

I followed her into the room and we did the normal stuff, height, weight, blood pressure.  When it came to the cuff and the reading of my heart rate I was freaking out.  She told me it was very high, and that the doctor will just retake it when he enters the room.  She took my form and handed me another form, this was a very short quiz.  

&amp;#x200B;

The quiz described scenarios and symptoms and asked you to mark how often you felt they were true.  The total at the bottom gave a rough indication of how severe the depression may be.  After being honest again, I scored moderate depression.  I sat for what seemed like an eternity until the doctor came into the room.  He smiled and asked me how I was.  The doctor also commented on how I had last been in his office three years ago, and how well I was progressing with my weight-loss and going to the gym.  I told him I was alright, but it was difficult to find the energy to do anything after work, ""and according to this form, I might have depression.""

&amp;#x200B;

He was very calm and kind, and explained to me that its OK.  He told me that plenty of people need some help, a boost, to get back to a healthy place.  If I would be alright with it, he explained, he would like to try out some anti depressants.  ""Some people need a boost,"" he continued, ""to get them to back on track.""   The doctor also asked if I wanted to be connected with a counselor, which I also eagerly agreed to.  We made a follow up appointment for 2 months from then and he wished me the best. I left with a prescription sent to my local pharmacy, at the store I work at part time, for Anti Depressants.  

&amp;#x200B;

I walked in, and left with a bottle of 30. The process was really unnerving, but it might have just been me.  I felt like I had a scarlet letter sewn on my shirt.  The reality:  No one cared.  I got my bottle and left.  I read the information on the side of the bottle when I hopped in my car.  Side effects lined up with what my Doctor had said, jitteriness, vivid dreams.  Not being able to drink alcohol while taking it was an unfortunate surprise, right before summer, but it is what it is.  I had my last drink that night, and in the morning I took my first Pill. My doctor had told me to reach out if I felt any different, or if I didn't like the taste of the medication, and we would try something else.  I didn't have any issues.

&amp;#x200B;

30 days later I just got my prescription refilled.    I don't make those jokes anymore, I really don't even think about that dark place I used to live in.  I cleaned my room, I get out of bed.  I went for a walk last week and I started logging my calories again.  I feel like what I imagined normal to be.  I had some weird dreams, and sure, I felt the jitters in the morning.  All of it was worth it to feel like I can finally make a change in my life.  

Thank you for reading.

21,"I want to start out by saying I have PTSD from my mother abandoning me as a child, emotional abuse from my siblings and sexual abuse by a family member my entire childhood. Amongst other things I have gone thru in life.

I had been in a relationship with my now ex for 9 years. Things weren’t always good but I always thought it would get better. Saturday night my ex and their parents physically abused me. 

I’m feeling hopeless, probably irrational and that I want to die. I went to therapy for my PTSD and none of my coping mechanisms are working. I was at the gym previous to this and broke down sobbing in the middle of my workout. I hate myself(???) for some reason that I’m entirely unsure of. I keep telling myself things will get better and suicide just keeps coming to mind every time. Like there is no way out and my life is just full of trauma and always will be.

24,"My daughter has been on Effexor for a few months now (150mg), and just had a bit of Wellbutrin added to counter the side effects. She had horrible nightmares, and that seemed to subside once Wellbutrin was brought in. The last 3 nights, she’s woken up in a total sweat, asking for me to be with her for a bit. Today, however, she started full on screaming this morning. I knocked on her door, which made her scream more. I told her it was just me, and asked how I could help.

She became belligerent, and I left. She went back to sleep, screaming again, yelling at someone that they’re a piece of sh*t. I went back, and she looked completely wild, screaming at me to “get the eff out!”
“You don’t effing care about me!”, it was like I was part of the nightmare. I told her I was going to get help and call 911.

Biggest mistake of my life. She flew out of the room, calling me every name in the book, and left. Tried to reach her, nothing. My husband got in touch a few hours later, and she said I never bothered to reach out and I don’t care. She told him I told her to kill herself and laughed at her. I did not.

She came back. Then got violent so I did  call 911. She told the first responders that I tried to kill her. She then said she was going to kill herself, so they took her to the mental health centre where she was “assessed” and sent home with nothing new. 

Turns out she skipped her meds, and has been smoking weed.

We don’t know how to deal with her, every word we say she yells at us, tells us she wants us to show we love her so we tell her we do, then she mocks us.

Her dr is on sick leave, we are at our wits’ end and have no clue how to calm her down and get her to rationalize (and take her meds!!).",07May2019,3

I'm a 28 (almost 29) years old failure who just keeps waiting for something to happen in his life.
Never had a friend or a girlfriend, i always suffered from a pretty bad form of Social Anxiety and by 6 years from Ocd. And obviously all this made me pretty depressed. While i feel lonely, on the other hand i don't really like people. They mostly seem boring and mediocre to me, when they're not utter trash. And internet didn't help much, since i basically had to stop using socials once i acknowledged the futility of them and how useless virtual interactions are (except maybe for obe girl i met on fb and i hope i could interact more with). I'm studying psychology at college after having pathetically lost 5 years of my life for a course i didn't care about just in the hope of being able to take my father's job in the future. Having to interact and do 20 years olds shit is pretty depressing, shit is even too easy, even if some people in class are nice and i'm kinda in friendly terms with a group. Don't think i'll ever be able to work tough, given my condition (i really cannot deal with people). I've way too many interests but i don't want to bore you by listing them. Ah, i've recently discovered that feminists/liberals and pc culture fanatics  on the internet have basically driven me to the centre in the political spectrum, something that would've surprised me just some month ago... Just to give you some reason to hate me lol. I mean, i'm italian so this doesn't even makes sense, but i interact way more with americans online that with italian people irl, so...
Wait, i changed my mind. I love reading books and manga, watching movies (""deep"" or authorial ones) or anime, playing videogames (especially jrpgs)... history, true crime, psychology... even a bit of philosophy recently... and politics i guess, but that's just a way to understand the world i have to live in i guess...

I’m in mental and physical agony every time I leave my house to the point of having to use all my energy not to scream or throw things or start hitting myself.

My grandpa is in overall poor health already, and has been declining. After more family drama yesterday, he’s been saying that he just wants to die and get it over with. He’s currently on many many different medications, including 3 separate antidepressants. His doctors don’t communicate with each other. He’s too depressed to fight and get them to help, or switch doctors.

43,"Okay, I've been hiding my fears for far too long. I will move past these irrational thoughts but they seems to spring back at any time i become deep in thought.

So from the top. I have been diagnosed with  anxiety/depression. It was manageable. Not so long ago this changed. 
1- Someone close to me passed away at a very young age .. and it was the first time I've lost anyone close. 
2- Tried (skunk)weed for the very first time. (I have never..I don't even smoke cigarettes)  and apparently it hits harder out of a water bong?=/ 

I was already freaked out about the ever looming death of everyone I love and myself. Everyone always told me ""Weed will help your anxiety!"" WRONG. I completely panicked. I was scared to move because it felt like i was bieng ""pulled"" through my actions. I was not in control of anything. I was completely in my head. I thought i was going to have a heart attack. My fiance was trying to help by telling me to breath over and over and runbing my back. In my mind I turned that into. IM NOT BREATHING, IM DYING. I had threw up on myself and he was trying to bring me to the room to change me and put me to sleep. There was a dark/coldness consuming me.. and suddenly i thought my fience was GOD (god diguised as my fiance) and that is how we pass over - like God would disguise as a loved one to help you accept your death and accompany you ""over""... And this felt so real, that I can't even explain. Theres way more to it, but to cut it short.. I woke up thinking that I died and my Hell or purgatory  was living my life knowing Im dead. 

Another note.. I suffer with Hypnopompic Hallucinations (hallucinating something inbetween sleeping and awakening) 

So for a long time after I'd wake up thinking a demon or something was coming to take my soul. 

Eventually all this subsides and everything seems back to normal. But sometimes I'll have a moment when I will stop and question my memory of it. And I freak myself out all over again. And the sickening feeling of none of this being real has lasted two days now. 

(Doc apt at the end of the month)

45,"My friends and counselor think i might have something else besides my GAD, but I don't know where to start looking? 

Context:
I was diagnosed with clinical depression, and GAD, by a conversion therapist (I am a trans man). 
I took Zoloft for a year before starting testosterone, but stopped as it made me disassociate, suicidal, and anxious. I am 9 months on T and experience little to no depression, no depersonalization, and am no longer suicidal. I have strong reason to believe that my gender dysphoria was actually incorrectly diagnosed as clinical depression, and what I actually had was situational depression.  I am now able to lead a pretty decent life for the most part, and im happy to continue growing, but I do still have anxiety. 


Now here is the problem: I over think things like crazy. My friends think I have OCD, while my counselor thinks I have ADHD. I took a small online screening and got PTSD (i dont think i have ptsd? But i get nightmares about conversion therapy still. It was two years ago).  

I have a tendency, when i have anxiety to count. I count in all sorts of ways. Evens, odds. I do multiplication tables. 

I get anxious about picking doors to enter a building. There's no actual consequence of either door. For example, ill take into consideration the placement of the door in relation to me, the consequences of opening each door, what potntial reaction I might get out of opening each door, what type of sound the door will make, what the door will feel like, what type of atmosphere I will walk into, and how i should behave myself in that atmosphere.  

All within the 45 seconds to choose between two doors that are literally side by side. 

Sometimes, it feels like I'm processing too much at one time. I was out for a walk with my friends and my brain wanted to take in everything- how many ridges were on a leaf, what type of material, my friend's clothes was made of, a loose thread on her shirt, the pavement felt hard, but there were some loose rocks on it. the sky. Each type of tree that I saw. They way the trees would feel if I touched them. Why some patches of grass looked more dead than others. Grass is more stiff when its dead and doesnt flow in the wind quite like fresh grass. 
It felt like too much to process at one time, and i got stressed out.

I know exactly how many lights/tables/markers are in my college classes usually.

You'd think this type of care would transfer to important things, but it absolutely does not. 

I zone out when people speak to me, I get distracted and walk off. I don't hear any instructions given to me. My counselor says can read people fairly well if im focused, so it's not a lack of social skill. (Plus, my mom has GAD and ever since i was little i learned how to know if anyone felt anxious/ would hurt me).  i forget to flush the toilet sometimes, and i have to triple check that i locked the house. I dont pay attention in class because it's not HARD hard (if I dont show up for my precal final, i'll get a B+). 

Ultimately though, it is very stressful and i get very tired of my brain. Is there anything i can do?",07May2019,2

52,"As the title says, my gf(21) just tried to commit suicide and I'm as lost as I can be. I've been a litter and a occasional poster but right now I need real advice from real people who have been through something similar. 

Background. 
I told lies about my family life that shocked everyone around. I grew up in a terrible environment, you name it I've been through it most likely. When I turned 18 I ran like hell away from them and been running since. I told my past friends and my girlfriend that they had died and had been good people to get people off my back about asking why I spent holidays by myself. I should've told the truth, I know, but both my pride and shame wouldn't let me. 

I told one friend who was hurt when he found out. Understandable. He told everyone and it hurt everyone. Explained why I did such things and gf said she understood. Still hurt her deeply though. 


Her grandfather was until two days ago, terminally ill. We've known for months and when she got the call I was not surprised. Sadden for sure, he was a good man and my gf loved him for raising her. He died just two days ago and she was with her family until tonight. Decided that she wanted to get drunk which I know isn't the best idea, but fuck it. She deserves a fucking relief from pain. 

She wanted to bath by herself and I let her. She came out with my back to her after bathing for thirty mins, said she wanted to be alone, and went into the kitchen. I barely heard her say I love you and when I went in the kitchen her arm was sliced superficially and shoved a hand full of melatonin down her throat. 

I got her to throw up the pills and bandaged her arm. Half a dozen cuts, two which broke the skin. I am at a lost. Is this my fault? Is this just the stress of both my betrayal and her grandad's death? How do I go about this in the morning when she wakes up? Does anyone have any advice please? I don't want to call the police or EMTs, the cuts aren't bad and if it scares her in the morning enough to shock her back to reality then I would rather that. But what do I say or do?

TL;DR my gf has been through a lot lately and tried self harm for the first time and idk what to do.",07May2019,3

I’ve asked my close friends if i smell bad and they all always say that i don’t but i think they just don’t wanna hurt or something. I always talk about that to my mom and all she does is just yell at me because she doesn’t believe me at all. I go to school and i feel like i smell like literal shit and sometimes sweat even tho i put on deodorant. It’s like even someone who doesn’t shower for a week doesn’t smell as bad as i do. And i’d say it’s all in my head but people EVEN MAKE FART NOISES YALL CAN YALL BELIEVE IT AND THEN MY FRIENDS AND MY MOM SAY THAT IM DELUSIONAL. I really wanna fucking die because it gets worse everytime. And my self esteem and anxiety are shit i can’t walk around school on my own because i don’t wanna see anyone.

I think this is noticeable, and it’s not a pleasant feeling either.


It usually just happens with people I don’t know super well / am just meeting, but now it’s moving onto people I have known for a while.

I have general anxiety that just seems infinite. I'm 19 years old, single, work 60-70 hours a week and I feel like I'm just doing it for nothing. I feel like I'm probably just going to commit suicide within this year or so and all this time spent clocking in and out was worthless. I don't have any debt or anything, I just work because if I stay at home I'm afraid my mind will be free to contemplate suicide; and I want to leave my family something behind. I don't feel in control of my mind. I haven't eaten in 3 or 4 days and that seems to somewhat preoccupy my mind, but also somewhat negatively affects my job performance. 

I judge my whole life's worth based solely on my job performance each day and some days I get very close to suiciding myself after a bad work day. There have been times so bad where the only reason I didn't go through with it was because we were short-staffed at work and it would be a jackass thing to do. 

I wish I could die in some type of strange accident or something so everybody could just say ""yeah he died in an accident"" and move on rather than ""ohhhh he hung himself it's so sad"". It sounds crazy but I wish suicide were more mainstream so people wouldn't criticize my decision so much. 

I don't want to die, I just want to be a normal person who isn't totally incapsulated by fear and panic. I've never been to a therapist but I wouldn't even know where to start if I got help. My anxiety just seems to go on forever.",07May2019,1

As soon as I did I asked what was wrong and the argument only got worse my father later on started to say that my mother wouldn't be the woman she would be today if it wasn't for him but that is not true as he had been a drug addict after my conception and later on wasn't around a lot of my life to the point that I once asked my mother if the reason i didn't see my dad was because he was dead. It had made me mad to hear that so I stood up for my mom unfortunately that only made it worse he then yelled at both of us at one point saying that he isn't even sure if I am actually his son.

67,"Hello. As the title states, I want to learn how to want things again, things that aren't immediate needs or hollow indulgence, IE, overeating or while bored or because it's there. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I am not an alcoholic, though rare, occasional drinking helps my mood immensely. I do not smoke, do drugs, or watch porn daily. The only thing I do is sleep, work when I get shifts, and play video games for long hours. I don't have many friends, at least, none that I can personally consider friends, and this may also be part of my issue. Socially, I have no urges. I know I am a bisexual, leaning hetero, from high school experiences, but after graduation, I don't wish to talk to people at all anymore, not even coworkers. The conversations I have are the same vapid everyday talks we all have. I don't feel empathy anymore. People talk to me and all I hear from them is nagging, pointless complaints, even when some of their issues are my own. All my interests are fleeting, because all my emotions are fleeting as well. I never feel prolonged joy, sadness, anger, I can't hold grudges or even develop my own opinions anymore. I'm permanently indecisive, but I never feel regret for any of my decisions, even if they are very poor ones or even self destructive.

&amp;#x200B;

 In short, I'm as apathetic to the world as I think I can possibly be. 

&amp;#x200B;

 My passions are low burning, and snuff out immediately when I try and work towards them. I have no motivation to do anything, progress with my life, develop relationships, and now, I have trouble even acknowledging my own basic human needs. I know this is an issue, but no matter what I say, or what anyone else says, I can't bring myself to do anything more than what I'm doing now. I've developed several inner voices to try and force me to do something else, but their influence is only as strong as I want them to be, and as the title implies, I don't care enough to help them help myself. Now they've just been ingrained into my subconscious and override my inner monologue on occasion. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I only have two constants in my life: An interest in game design, and an interest in the arts, but these still suffer from the same low-burning issue everything else in my life has. It's not self-doubt, I know I'm fully capable of being a good creator in some way or another, and the ideas I have are refined more and more every day in my mind, but I never feel any motivation to produce, practice, or share my work. After a few minutes, maybe an hour of trying, I just go back into this state of uncaring. I cease to care about whatever I'm working on and have hundreds of unfinished drawings, songs, models, you name it, sitting on my hard drive as a result.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not able to speak to a therapist due to financial and insurance constraints, at least, none that I am aware of. I don't dare self-diagnose, because one symptom can have dozens of underlying causes. I had no father figure: Divorced due to abusive relationship, and I had a lot of repressed desires when I was younger. My mother says I have Asperger's Syndrome, because of course I do, and that I went to a therapist when I was 3 so we could treat it early, but I question that often. I'm inherently distrustful of people, and my mother included, as she has exhibited a lot of deceitful and arrogant traits over the years. It doesn't help that most of my friends during school have lost contact with me, have or intentionally pushed themselves away, or are generally poor, needy, or unreliable friends, though I again wonder if that's a cause or result of my issue.

&amp;#x200B;

They say acknowledging a problem is the first step to fixing it. TL;DR, I feel nothing for anything for more than a few minutes at most, but with that in mind, I have no direction to go to treat this problem. I can't even discern what is the cause or result of my numbness, but I know it exists, and that it is not normal for someone my age, or in my position. I feel completely separate from the world around me that I don't really know why I'm asking Reddit for advice. I just am on impulse right now. I have so little else to do right now I'm actually trying to stretch this thread as long as I can before I grow bored and exhausted again.

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions, then, Reddit?",07May2019,3
68,"Throughout elementary and up to a point in intermediate school, i was outgoing, always found it easy to contribute to conversations, and had no problem leading. i felt transparent in the best sense. I had no filter, not that i needed one to begin with. It felt like no one cared, i didn’t care, i was happy. I always carried a bit of a shyness, but nothing that really impacted me personally. Around 6th grade i had to drop pretty much all my advanced classes due to my grades, however during this time i found a love for music. I joined the school orchestra playing cello, and was placed in the Chamber Orchestra group ( the advanced group ). My grades began to affect me. Throughout the 4 years i was playing cello, not once was i eligible to participate in the yearly state UIL trip. Heck, 60% of the schools field trips i couldn’t attend simply because i was failing a class or two. Teachers were treating me different. I felt different, i felt like i was the center of attention, but for the wrong reasons, and i couldn’t help it. I felt isolated from everyone else and began to question myself internally. Emotions would come and go, i became shy, insecure, and began to distance myself, which i would continue to regret and often would convince myself its too late anyway. I’ve always kept things in my head. I never cared to inform anyone of what i was going through because i was scared to say it. I would feel some kind of guilt just from the thought of it. As if “I’m no doctor so what do i know” and that i didn’t qualify to consider myself anything. Not only that but i had always managed myself just fine, I figured i would just get through it. I knew about depression, anxiety, and such, but they never made sense to me. I only knew them as words, and always denied myself. My senior year i nearly feinted while voluntarily asking a question to the teacher in class. I quickly felt heavy, i was talking while the world felt like it was collapsing and managed to spill out the rest of the question which in total happened in under 5 seconds. It was over once i got it out, but my heart was racing and beating heavy. Is that a thing?? In social group conversations, i never have anything to say. Usually a laugh and and agreement with the conversation is enough to not be bothered, but in direct conversation, i feel like i have tunnel vision, or a deer in headlights, i feel restricted. Ill smile and try to agree with whoever it is , the whole time telling myself how awkward the situation is and scrambling to figure out what to even say. Afterwards Ill think about it over and over about what i should have said or “why didn’t i say that”, and just the situation as a whole. My mind is constantly rambling. I almost hate it. Im 19 now turning 20 in June. In addition to everything else i now find myself getting upset too easily. I feel like I’m always in a rush to figure something out or else ill never achieve my goals. ill end it here, just looking for thoughts and suggestions please. I feel its a waste to try to seek medical help if theres actually no problem at all, and at that point i feel id have made a fool of myself. If you have anything to say, ill be happy to hear it.

70,"I experienced about three mental breakdowns all during the time I was struggling with my studies due to almost being kicked out of university (i.e. poor performance) and sprinkled with past mistakes. The impact was based on the fear of being a failure in society. 

In the beginning, I didn't know what was wrong with me , as I tried to keep my struggles secretive and brush it off. I was also naive enough to think that acquaintances, or anybody in particular means well and that's coming from someone who doesn't have any issues with anybody but some want to see your downfall for no reason. 

Fast forward to the three seperate breakdowns, I was mocked at for breaking down instead of being supported and that's when I realised why people don't want to seek help in the first place because the dark side of mental health  isn't mentioned at all. 

I ended up going through self help and meditations routines after those three encounters to tackle a few problems. I managed to graduate from university and now have a master's under my belt with a well paying job. Unfortunately, self help / improvement is an ongoing process that can't be stopped.

The issue is that when i put in my mind a mental image of something, i somehow start mixing up if it was a mental image or a real memory, and it is very annoying.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, lets say someone told me a certain person loves a certain game, for example pubg, i would somehow imagine having a conversation with that guy about pubg, and after a bit, i would start mixing up if that mental image of the conversation was just something i thought about or a real memory.

a close friend commited suicide a couple months ago, and somehow his family thinks that it was because of the game Blue Whale, when I heard that, I got really lost and mad, because I somehow remember a conversation with him about the game, but i'm not sure if this memory is a real one or just one of a mental image i had, and this thing is killing me, because if it is in fact a real memory, then i knew he was playing such a dangerous game and i didn't stop him, in the memory i just warn him, but i could have done more.

&amp;#x200B;

Some back story: 

&amp;#x200B;

Mom and dad have an 11 year age gap. Dad married late at 36, he had his first kid at 37 and the last at 45. Mom had the first kid at 26 and last at 35. First child (25+F), second child (25+M), third child (18+F). 

Dad had a great stable job in the finance sector but was not good with money. Would get breaks with good jobs and understanding employers but wouldn't care. Wouldn't file expenses on time (like his effing salary), would leave early, come late, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Was/Is emotionally and psychologically abusive to his kids and his wife. We have always sided with my mom and showered her with love which I'm sure annoys the shit out of him. Throughout our childhood he has been nice and then extremely abusive after. He treats outsiders with respect (too much imo) and is seen as a nice guy. He will go the extra-mile for others but get really angry and irritated in doing so for his wife and kids. His family (his siblings, cousins, etc) are pieces of shit too. They have narrow view points, don't value education (my mom does and this is one thing she made sure her kids got) and instead value material things. He is highly influenced by them and they love stirring the pot. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now if my dad budgeted well we easily could have been upper middle class. He would often not have money for rent, school fees etc and would make my mom sell her gold (which she received by her parents on their wedding day). This was roughly USD 100,000 + but this was back in the early 2000's so I'm sure it would be worth more. Regardless mom would keep this hidden from us until we got much older. 

&amp;#x200B;

His fits are normally him shouting at us or breaking things. He values his family (siblings, niblings) a lot. Originally his brother immigrated to the same country we live in with his wife and 2 young kids and lived with us for a short while. One day my brother ended up taking a chip packet from one of the young kids, the young kids mom saw and complained etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

They left the house for dinner, my dad ended up breaking plates, made us all sit in the living room. Shouted at us, I was roughly 5-6 years old and it is the first memory I have of my strong mom actually crying. He would do stupid shit like that all the time, wrong directions = shouting match in the car, etc. He was especially harsh on my brother as he was a boy but was introverted, meek etc. My mom also would take my brother's side and cover up for him. It didn't help that he was a straight C student while my sister and I got straight A's. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then in 2011, when I was 11 my dad really fucked up. He lost his job and sat at home that entire summer. My sister was supposed to go to university abroad but he wasted that money away (as usual). He never saved either or listened to my mom in that matter. He wasn't going to do anything so my mom went with my sister to get her admitted to the best local university. Money was tight but it was tight before and we thought we would get through it. Nope. I ended up having to drop out of middle school (I only finished by giving the exams privately with a lot of difficulty). Brother skipped uni (too expensive, he is almost done now but 6 years later than he should have). 

&amp;#x200B;

Now he would shout in this time period as well, we have often lived without internet (which is ok kinda) and electricity for months. I'm not even kidding, I have spent all day in the mall food court with my mom and siblings only to go home to sleep and do it all over again. This would happen cause he did not pay rent or the electricity company. Both of which have been very understanding, would allow super late payments, etc. My dad would spend money on useless things (mainly cars) and wouldn't budget for living expenses. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the middle even when it was tough he would always say stupid shit like oh your sister can go to university abroad tell her to apply, we will move out of this house etc etc. That never happened and over the years he would be really antagonistic to my mom. He even left us without our visas for like 2+ years, leaving us to be essentially illegal residents. Slowly we would lose some privileges, electricity, internet, my moms car, school etc. He would be nice and mean at the same time. He would be supportive and help out with stuff and then be a bitch the next week. He has now started being nicer to my brother. We don't take shit standing anymore as a family. Before he would see our reactions now even when he shouts we don't flinch. Once he saw we didn't have much of a reaction he kinda stopped doing it at least for 2 - 3 years. That is until now. 

&amp;#x200B;

My dad has left us in a situation where he has effed up shit all over. We have no one to turn to, we don't speak to family back home. He has apparently borrowed money from people saying I need it for my family and then wasted it.

&amp;#x200B;

We are almost done with getting back on track. My sister finished uni and got a job. My brother is in his last semester for uni. I am young but I am already working a full-time job (mainly due to income and I needed a visa). My dad doesn't have his visa, hasn't paid this year's rent and is being a bitch daily. He now fights will my mom daily, he will say shit to my brother too. I don't get it, I just don't. He fights and throws things daily.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now he is in his 60s and my mom is in her 50s and she is tired af. She has extremely high blood pressure which we are treating now and type 2 diabetes too. My dad would never take her to the hospital either but would go himself. LIke fucking hell dude that is your wife. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now my actual question for this sub is what is wrong with my dad? I'm sure there is some level of bipolar disorder here but I don't get it. Insecurity issues too, he came from a poor family, worked his way up and imo squandered it. My mom on the other hand came from a kinda well-off family. Is there something I'm missing to see here? 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, as for therapy my dad would never go, never even tried when my mom would tell him. I would never pay for it for him. Us kids will go to therapy but where I live it isn't really present and also expensive af. It is not covered in any kind of insurance. Once I've sorted out living arrangements, etc it will be a priority.",07May2019,2
81,"When I was around 8-12+ years old. After I got diagnosed with jaundice, and spent many weeks isolated in the hospital, I couldn't sleep or travel far from my parents. I also also used to get compulsive thoughts that forced me to do things, to avoid hurting myself, mostly by exposing my sins and secrets to my parents. It felt like I was blackmailing myself, and if I didn't comply to my thoughts, I couldn't stop/control myself - basically it was inevitable. I'd unreasonably doubt if I did certain activities, so I'd repeat them again, and again until I felt sure that I did them, because I'd hurt myself otherwise. My coping mechanism was that I had to keep myself busy with mind games, games in general, or play with friends. 

After sometime, I grew out of it, though I still experienced some intense compulsive thoughts from time to time. Before, the feeling was constant, but later on, it was like a switch inside me that kept switching on and off - it's akin to the feeling of sever guilt, I'd say. Now I'm 19 years old, and don't remember my last time, so hopefully I'm passed that.

82,"I used to hate my outer self, how I looked, how much I weighed etc. But now for some days I'm not being able to stand myself. I loathe myself as a whole now, even the one beneath this pathetic lump of meat I call my outer self.

I know that I can control my physical appearance to an extent, change some of the toxic habits that I have. But how can I change myself completely? I know that it's irrational, but I still can't keep it out of my head. I feel like an utter failure even though there are literal proofs that I'm not. I can't simply control my emotions right now.

A little bit of context, I've been diagnosed with ADHD and OCD. I have severe social anxiety too, if that helps. I just posted it here because I wanted to let it out. I have many more things to say but that would be too much. I like support more than extreme sympathy or the complete lack of it. Every single time I talk to somebody about it, they tell me to strengthen my mind. This guy that day told me that he's got Depression but he doesn't go around and tell people about it. My psychiatrist who also apparently provides counseling said even before listening to my problems that I can't control the problems I have, so counseling won't help and pushed a dump of antidepressants down my throat. I don't know if they're working at all. The psychotherapist I had before this one turned out to be a fraud. I wanted to become an illustrator but I can't seem to focus on practicing, hence I'm on the same level I was 4 years ago. I did my bachelor's degree last year but that is worthless for me because I don't want to do any of the jobs that come with that degree so I've been inside my bedroom for the last one year and all of the friends I had are doing their higher studies in some of the best universities of my country.

At this point I feel like a failure even though I know that there are ways I can get out of it. My brain controls me entirely and I can't seem to get out of this toxic bubble that is also my comfort zone. I don't feel good inside it, I want to get out, but the world outside scares me.

85,"Hi all,

First of all, I'm not fluent in English, I'm sorry in advance for weird expressions.

I write this post to ask how to go to psychiatrist...I will explain my situation first, and the questions are at the very bottom.

 

I've been suffered from a very atypical depression for a long time. I've tried to get proper treatments for myself since I got a diagnosis, but my clinical phase has been not that successful. I'm doing well now, but I know I could be ""sick"" any time....so here's the problem.

I'm planning to live in America for few years from this June. I'd like to find a new doctor and get a treatment during I stay there, since it is not reasonable option to take all medication for a long time (more than a year)

I searched a future doctor in the website which shows me a list of in-a-network providers, and I called one of these providers to ask the availability in June. A university hospital. There was a doctor I want to make an appointment with since his sub-specialty seems perfectly matching with my status (I'm sure about this because I studied a lot about my disease and my doctor explained my status to me a lot.) 

The answer was ""There is no availability in May, and 50-50 chance in June. So please contact us in early June. And you can tell us your preference for a specific doctor, but we cannot guarantee of matching.""

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are

1. What can I do to increase my chance to make an appointment with this hospital in June?
2. Similar question. What should I do to be matched with a doctor who I want to see?
3. Do I need to go to generalist first to make an appointment with them (a university hospital)? The concierge didn't mention it but I read about this rule in a website, after phone call
4. My insurance cover a part of medical expense, so I wonder how it will cost for my regular consultation. Is it inappropriate if I ask the cost to the concierge in advance?

“Brace yourself I’ll take you on a trip down memory lane”


So, I’ve hit an area in my life which has been rather terrifying for the past 2 years (I’m 21 years old). Everything in my life was going well, had a lot of close friends, was attending university, had a part-time job and was just rolling with life really. When I was 19 I started smoking weed everyday for about a year and a half, most nights I would come home and my mum would be pissed screaming, the police would be round and she would be clinically depressed (all this jazz has been happening for about 10 years at this point). One time when I was 13 I was in the house by myself and she had passed out in the bathroom after drinking a bottle of vodka and smashed her head on the radiator. When I walked into the room I turned the light on and saw her lying lifeless on the ground staring into the ceiling with a pool of blood behind her head. I feel like this impacted me quite a bit, every time I would come home I would have anxiety, and I started developing shakiness (nothing that was uncontrollable) but whenever any task or anything came to hand I wouldn’t follow through with it. I became a very sociable person of being out the house most of the time with my mates, getting BATTERED and then turning to drugs.  I smoked everyday for a year and a half (a draw between me and my mates or smoking with other people and smoking 7-14 spliffs) I feel the first signs is that I was being affected by my mood as I would have mood swings throughout the day and then in the evening I would get high, then would come home to a toxic environment. I was about to move to university for my second year and during that summer before I would move down to my university I decided that it would be a good idea to quit weed and stay in my house to help my mum out before I would leave. 


During this time I was figuring out where she was hiding the booze, she would compulsively lie that she was drunk. Spitting, punching, screaming uncontrollably at my family. And during this time i was unaware that I was actually having drug withdrawals from weed and this toxic home environment was amplifying these withdrawals because I wasn’t taking time out to chill with my mates or do anything fun I was stuck with toxicity and it was clouding my head. I started self-analysing and started to dislike myself, becoming paranoid of thinking “is this was people think of me?” I was breaking down solid relationships I had with my mates where I would stay inside messing myself up with these withdrawals. I completely shunned everyone and everything, started to becoming paranoid to the point where I deleted my social media because I didn’t trust it. Yes, during this point I had noooo clue I was being paranoid, it all made complete sense at the time. So basically, during the end of this episode I had pushed most of my mates away, where they didn’t start to like me, had no success with changing my mums addiction, and began to self loathe myself (oh and at this point the doctors said that I was having a drugs induced psychotic episode). So what did I decide to do? I decided to go away and clear my head in Asia. 


I don’t remember much of my time in Asia, what I do remember that it was very shit. Very very shit. My personality was altering itself while I was on this tour, my mind felt that it was taking my body through this time away and my personality was altering itself. I became very paranoid from all the build up put not trusting anyone or anything that at one point when I was in this bus. My mind popped. I looked at the taxi driver and thought I was going to be killed. My body went into fight or flight and I jumped out of the moving taxi and ran into the jungle. The locales and taxi men who I was with chased after me. I ran through the jungle and I could hear a group of them coming after me. I came out to the jungle where a bunch of them drove past me on mopeds. One of them was standing there with a machete. And a whole bunch of them were standing there, picked me up onto the road and I was talking to them. I didn’t know these people. I didn’t want to be with these people. They would start having conversations with each other being passive aggressive saying things like “Adam” going towards the sky like I was going to die, at this point I think they were feeding on the fact that my mind wasn’t there so they were playing with me? They said a car would pick me up. Each of them were trying to take photos of me while I was covered in mud, bleeding and looked fucked outta my head. When the car came to pick me up. I was reassured by them “nothing is going to happen to you” I think they were smiling because of how ridiculous my mindset was. At the end of the day they’re harmless Buddhists. But my body being fuelled by all this shit. Decided to run down the road. I was being chased by people on mopeds. People came out of their houses. I was in someone’s pool. They started throwing rocks at me. Hitting the ground with bamboo sticks, as if I was a rat getting out to be cornered. They dragged me out into the street where there was about a hundred people standing there watching me. I was being pulled over to a car with my arms. I got into the car and I was fucked. At this point I had been through so much shit within two months, I fully started to lose my mind. 

I was taken back to the hotel, covered in mud, my feet were bloody and my face was as pale as a ghost. The staff at the hotel were trying to chill with me telling me it was going to be fine. But in my head I was to the point where I thought assassin’s were hired to come to the hotel to kill me. Yes that’s right, fucking assassins for a 20 year old who’s clearly smoked too much weed. I couldn’t trust anything or anyone. I just wanted to be home. I was locked in my room because I was acting fucked up walking up and down the hotel, I thought the pool was full of poison. And I thought my air vent was pushing out gas to poison me. These thoughts weren’t channelled through rational thinking my mind was working by itself going at 1000000 miles a fucking hour trying to get my body to safety. I went up to the roof of the hotel to get away from these “threats”. A fire endgame came and a bunch of the people took me down from the building then put me in the car. I was taken to a hospital where I believe they were taking me to calm me down with sedatives. Whereas my brain said “there gonna inject you and kill you”. So. What did I do you ask? I ran down the road being chased. Again. At this point I was jumped on about 5 of them. They tied me by my arms and legs this time. Throwing me into a taxi and took me to this mental hospital. Where I was taken out and placed onto a bed. Tied by my arms and legs and then rolled into the hospital. I was injected with sedatives and woke up in the morning. Surrounded by mentally ill people, the door open and my arms and legs were tied. Long story short it was fucking shit. I was flown home.

So what’s happened since then? Well it’s been about a year and a half since all that since that went down and well. Two months after I got back from Asia I got a girlfriend? Fucks knows. I was drinking alcohol, snorting coke, taking MD to get outta my own head. I was going out every weekend, drinking a lot at the pub. My whole family left my house and I was back at my house with my mum by myself (who’s alcohol problems have gotten worse by the way) every time I would go out she would text me and say she was going to commit suicide after her mum died 3 months after I got back from Asia, unfortunately she’s refusing to get help but we’ll see how we go. I was unemployed for a year and was using my student finance to live because I fully couldn’t get a job because I was so fucked. But I have gotten my old job back because one of my mates who is the manager decided to give me back my job to help me out. I only drink 3/4 pints if I go out now. I’ve quit drugs. I’ve started the gym and lost a stone because of drinking alcohol. I’ve got my mates back but I keep on having mood swings from the trauma I expect. I’m currently living in a 1 bedroom flat with my sister and dad as my mum and dad are sorting out their divorce (unfortunately my mum hasn’t stopped drinking). I broke up with my girlfriend because I didn’t feel that it was right and there was some trust issues there. I’ve started kickboxing (which I’m pretty sick at) and trying to jump on a diet. I started taking driving lessons (I was getting pretty good but I ended up moving to my dads flat) I’m heading back to university in September to carry out with sociology, Criminology and a extension on the degree with doing film. And I’ll be moving out of my area soon. Throughout all this time I’ve been on 0 medication and no therapy. I decided 2 weeks ago to seek out the doctors because I’m still recovering from the traumas now living in a peaceful environment, the only stress is there’s no WiFi here but imma get that sorted soon. I thought throughout all this time I was either Schizophrenic, bipolar, psychotic and all that. But I was told that I was non of these things and I have a little bit of anxiety, and I’m being on edge a little because of the trauma. My mind is beginning to calm and I’m starting to connect again. Only issue now is I feel a bit disconnected but not out of control. I wanna build on my confidence, self esteem and build back up my relationships with others and myself. It often does cross my mind that before I got places it’s of who knows what and how do people see me now. But I believe even though it’s a hard world we live in that there is beauty in every bad situation and that people are there willing to help, but I believe you need to help yourself first.  And I think it’s important to not see yourself as a victim in these situations but see it as something that you’ve battled through and even though your situation might not be amazing think how many battles you’ve overcome because I know I have. If there’s anything I’ve learnt from this is that you get what you put out,  if you give out hate, have a pessimistic mind, hatred or seeking revenge. Well guess what? You’re only going to have all these things mirrored back at you, that’s my experience anyways. It’s sometimes easy to see yourself as the victim in these situations, I know I might be the protagonist of my own life by I’m just a character in all these collection of stories happening around me. A lot of people go through worse and are handling worse. I’m walking out of this and I have picked up a few scars a long the way but a lot of lessons have been learnt in such a short amount of time and I feel I’m beginning to change. And now I can see through that shit time there was a lot of influences behind my actions and that I was ill and none of my thoughts and actions were being chandler by rationality only the ‘flight or fight’ indict with a sprinkle of paranoia. 

So I know some of my mates use reddit. And I’ve been reading some replies people have for others who are going through something and I’ve actually been blown away from answers. It’s crazy some peoples understanding of this world and their inner selves. So if it isn’t any trouble I was going to ask what steps do you guys reckon I should take next?",07May2019,1
91,"I hate my mother because of the way that they think, especially their opinions when it comes to mental health.

My mother, despite having experienced depression herself due to several deaths of loved ones, still firmly thinks that depression that wasn't a result of grief in teens and young adults is MAINLY caused by overuse of gadgets. She often tells me from time to time that I should avoid overusing my gadgets to prevent the chances of being depressed. Every time that there is a news report on TV about involving the topic of people with mental illnesses/mental health issues, she always says that that's what people get for being addicted to gadgets, even though news reports never mentioned that addiction to gadgets was the cause most cases of mental illnesses. She thinks that using gadgets too much is the main cause of non-grief depression.

I strongly disagree with her and many times I've wanted to tell her that she is wrong, gadget addiction is NOT the main cause of depression. Not all people affected by non-grief depression got their depression from gadget addiction. Sure, there might be studies linking the connection of the overuse of gadgets and increasing depression and anxiety, but that does not necessarily mean that overuse of the gadgets is automatically the leading and main cause of mental health illnesses. Depression can happen to anyone and anytime for many reasons, sometimes people are not even sure of the exact reason why they feel depressed. Depression is not and will never just be ""feeling sad or lonely"", it is a serious mental health condition that should be addressed with careful understanding and proper medical care. 

 I don't have the courage tell her any of this. I had started to feel depressed and became suicidal since I was 10, because at that time the only attention I received from my parents was repetitive scolding about my grades not being high enough (my grades were just all above average) and how terrible of a sister I was for arguing that my brother should not have the right to watch television for almost the entire day. I tried telling her once that I wanted to kill myself and that I wished I was dead... She got mad at me and demanded that I repeated what I said, which I did, and she responded by asking me if I was out of my mind and that I should never make such a bad joke again because she said that people who commit suicide go straight to Hell. But it wasn't a joke at all. It was how I was feeling at that moment, and my own mother thinks that I was just telling a bad joke.  

My mother is also one of those people who think that with mental illnesses don't have enough faith in God. I believe in God and the teachings of the Bible, but I know that a single prayer is not an instant solution to recovering from a mental illness right away. However, it is a good start. Prayers take time, and so does the strengthening of an individual's faith in God. Even people who are greatly religious, have strong faith, and love God are still capable of experiencing a mental illness. My mother strongly thinks that religious people are immune to mental illnesses or never experience such things because of their faith, but I know it's not true. I simply have no energy to discuss this matter with her anymore.

A few weeks ago she asked me if I was happy with my life and wanted an honest answer. Every part of me was screaming ""NO"", and I wanted to cry because my self-hatred has increased even more worser than it was before. After years of learning how to lie about my feelings, I calmly told her that my life was okay at the moment, even though it really was not. She told me that she was glad for me, and that I could tell her anything if I wanted to say something, and I should spend less time on my gadgets because I might become depressed at some point. I know that she won't understand that the reason I spend so much time on my gadgets is because I get to communicate with my closest friends who take time to listen and comfort me without negative judgment. I sometimes think that they were the angels that God sent to me when I was on the verge of giving up on life, and I am really thankful that until now they're still here for me.

I wish someday my mother would understand. I wish I could tell her how much I hate myself and how many times I've though about killing myself because of how I thought that my existence as useless.  But as long as she thinks that gadget addiction is the main cause of mental illnesses, I don't think I could ever tell her about how I have been feeling these past few years. I don't know if I am recovering, or if I am just getting better at hiding how I truly feel about myself and about my life.

I already have been to therapy from 2014 to 2016. I always thought that I’m cured and won’t need help anymore.


But recently I have been struggling.

Just like the title said,  I cry about every stupid shit you can imagine. Even tough I know that it’s stupid and won’t change anything. 
I can’t stop crying. Most of the time it’s minor inconveniences that get me going the most.

For example the other day my bluetooth mouse gave out and I literally cried for two hours. 
Today a package arrived that I was waiting for. Upon opening I realised that I bought the wrong thing and you know what happened? I cried for an hour. 
As you can imagine this gets really tiresome and completely ruins my day.

The worst part about it is, how upset I’m making myself feel. After those crying fits I can’t function anymore. I get tired and completely unmotivated do to anything. 
That feeling, unfortunately, won’t go away and I’m literally upset for the whole day. 

I don’t know how to cope with this. I don’t even know how to prevent myself from crying. Or how to cheer myself up again.

101,"Hi guys, is anyone of you experienced with burnout? I am not doing too well and I dont know if it is because of my sucky job, depression or that I am approaching burnout. Or maybe Im already over the edge. I come home crying from work almost every day, not just because of work stress, but also from the deeply unhappy feeling I get from the thoughts of having to work the rest of my life in such a place for 5 days a week. I used to think my struggles at work resulted from me experiencing some severe depression, but maybe it is the other way around.

I also experience a lot of work stress (I have a quite demanding and busy job) and dont enjoy it anymore. I feel paralyzed, unable to cope with the situation and out of control. I am also afraid to talk about it with my managers, I feel like they dont have any solution for me.

Does anyone have tips on what I should do now? Is my work stress a result of depression or is it the other way around. Am I already in A burnout or is there still something I can do?

Thank you for reading and Id love to hear your perspective or advice. Best of luck to you all.",07May2019,4
102,"I have come to fully understand something, at 25 years of age - it's not your fault how adults treated you when you were a kid. You literally had not a single ounce of control over their stupidity, selfishness and incapability. 

If you were abused, hurt, ripped apart by their words or even physically injured by those so-called grown-ups in your childhood, **it is absolutely and categorically not your fault**. And it is not your job to fix it. It's not your job now and it wasn't your job then. You had no control over their actions and no responsibility for them. They had the responsibility to care for you and they messed it up big time. You did not ask to be born into the situation you were born into. You were a vulnerable child whose needs, for some reason or another, were not fully met. And that rests entirely with the adults, not with you. A child can never be blamed for that. And the child who turns into the adult should not blame themselves for their parents' shortcomings, either. 

Also, **you owe them nothing**. They may have fed you and put a roof over your head, but if they otherwise treated you like shit, or still do treat you like shit, walk the fuck away and don't look back. Now you're an adult and you have choices and autonomy over your own life. You don't need to be around them if you don't want to, or if it doesn't feel safe and secure. 

I am so sorry that this happened to you and, believe me, I understand. Parents are not all as brilliant and kind as they're supposed to be. Some of them are assholes. One of mine was. Just want you to know you're not alone and you can live a happy life as an adult, without them.",07May2019,311

104,"I'm new here, and on Reddit. I'm not even sure whether I should be posting this here, but I really don't know what else to do. I've been struggling with severe motivational and procrastination issues for ever since I can remember, where I can barely bring myself to put a few minutes of effort to study for my exams, or do coursework for classes. The last time I did 'well' for any exam or actually put effort into my schoolwork or classwork was high school. Studying didn't matter as much in high school as I could absorb content simply by paying attention in class. When I graduated, I had the grades to do Chemical Engineering, and I joined University with the intention of becoming a chemical engineer back in 2015, chronic procrastination and lack of interest led me to fail out of it in 2016. I told myself(and those around me), that I had failed because ""Engineering was not for me"", and that I hadn't prepared myself for the amount of math I would be doing. In High school, I had always excelled in Biology over Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics, and what I told myself to console myself sort of made sense in my shame and sadness over failing out of Engineering school. Due to my science background and me always looking up to professional degrees, such as engineering, medicine or accounting over general degrees like business or social science, I then decided to apply to medical school. I know what you're thinking, I'm super crazy for doing this, but I somehow convinced myself and everyone around me that I would do well. I had always done well in Biology, and I had always had reasonable people skills, and this seemed like a decent combo for a med student. In med school, I excelled at all the in class work, like the discussions and the practical sessions, but I always tanked the exams. This was because, again, I would not study in a rational manner, choosing to procrastinate endlessly by spending time on the internet.(This has been the pattern since this problem began, I dont party hard with friends, spend too much time with them, but I spend 8 hours a day on Youtube, Netflix and the Internet in general.) Then, a few hours before the exam, I would scramble to read 14 weeks of slides within a few hours. During the exams, I'd struggle to recollect whatever was taught to me. Still I had a mediocre mark until the final exam, where I repeated the same behavior. This stupidity obviously couldnt work for 28 weeks of slides and class, and as I expected, I flunked. When I failed out of med school, it was actually a surprise to a lot of my classmates and friends, who thought I was pretty capable. This time, I couldn't lie to myself, I had really wanted to be a doctor, I was already planning out my specialization and my future in medicine. I knew something had to be wrong with me. In 2 years, I had flunked out of 2 different university programs. I took a year off after that, worked a little but mostly, just idled. I then joined school again to with the intention of majoring in Political Science. I find myself dipping into my old patterns again, I can barely study and continuously procrastinate again. Now its even worse, I'm skipping classes too. Also, I'm fatter than ever, and have been putting off gym activities and other co-curricular activities in favor of 'internetting' my time away. I'm worried that I will fail for the 3rd time now. Why am I so unmotivated? Whats wrong with me? Why can't I prioritize my activities?",07May2019,2
105,"(TL:DR; After 10 years of working through my issues, I've ended up self-harming 10 years from the start of my journey. The most worrying aspect right now...is that I feel no remorse, just complacency. How can I stop this before it takes hold of me again?)

I promise to try and keep this brief, but it'll be the first time writing it all down in years. In my youth I turned to self-harm as a crutch. I'd spent years in isolation struggling to come to terms with who was to blame, and how to make a real change.

At my worst I sought out help. It had taken me years to ask for help. The next few months completely unravelled my life. After speaking to a professional for the first time ever, my employer at the time decided it was best to let me go. My family looked at me in shame. I felt as though everything had been turned around; so I never spoke to a professional again. At the time I had one friend who stuck by me, however our bond was held together through playing things down and drink.

After a few months they vanished. Completely disappeared. I managed to find them a couple of months later, picking them up at the local hospital. They had been found over-intoxicated on the streets. It gave me some perspective, and I worked hard at improving my outlook and appearance. Some demons may have remained, but I wasn't going to end up the same way.

I can say this for sure; my life now compared to my youth is better in every aspect. Though I feel the bar has moved considerably. A few years ago I was proud at how far I had come, and the progress I had made. Now though, I feel that old sense of futility wash over me. From the job no-one respects (a profession where I am the sole role in the company), to the expectations of me now I'm ""mature"". 

I've started to feel as though I no longer know myself, as though progress hasn't so much been made only re-allocated. I find it hard to not want to start the blame-game again. To start pointing out my flaws to myself constantly. However the biggest fear is even considering to ask for help in any way. Not only did one conversation take everything at the time that was holding me together and smash it to pieces, but for the past ten years I have accomplished so much on my own (even if I'm starting to feel that the progress was limited), and I can't loose it all again.

To which I find myself here. No family to turn to, no friends to lean on, telling myself to at least reach out anonymously; even if it goes against every doubt and fear in my head. I can only tell myself to remember the choice I made ten years ago. To not let this be the path to remission. The feeling of entrapment drove me to self-harm last time, and I can feel it's presence behind me once again. The most worrying aspect right now...is that I feel no remorse, just complacency. How can I stop this before it takes hold of me again?",07May2019,2

108,"Essentially what the title says...A bit of back story...A few years back, my uncle was Baker Acted due to being suicidal, since he lost 90% use of his feet. Because of this, his son (my cousin) took all of his guns from him (pistols, rifles, shotguns). 

Fast forward to today:

He still does not have the guns, his father (my grandfather) does now, in his attic. The reason behind this is because my cousin died tragically in September 2018, so grandfather had to take the guns. While cleaning up our cousins house, my uncle took the gun cabinet that my cousin had and bought a new lock for it (had to be drilled out by locksmith) to get the guns back. I have guns, I have a gun cabinet, and I have offered to clean and store them safely. My stepfather and uncle are refusing me to let them be stored by me, not sure why, but could be a sentiment thing?

Last night my mother brought up to my step dad that giving the guns back to my uncle in his state of mind is by far the wrong thing to do, and I agree. Quite frankly we are worried that if he obtains and possesses the guns again, there will be a murder/suicide very shortly afterwards. I am conflicted because I will be the one to clean the guns and quite frankly, I don't want to be responsible for cleaning them up and handing them back over knowing that I may have just cleaned and oiled their tools of choice. So, I am on the verge of: cleaning them and locking them in my safe, refusing to clean them, or voicing my opinion, cleaning them, and then handing them over...I just need some advice as to what would be the right thing to do...I have very little family left and those that I do have left, I don't want to cut ties with me over this, and I don't want them to end up taking their own lives, but if they cut ties with me because of this, then I could live with that...",07May2019,1
109,"One of my close friends has mental health problems but both of us aren't sure what exact disorders apply to her. She is extremely resistant to seek professional help or get diagnosed by a doctor.

Symptoms she often shows include:

- Not caring about herself or her well being. This is part of why she is resistant to seek professional health.
- A lack of sense of self, and related to that, often feeling ""nothing-y"" (I don't entirely understand what she means when she says this but I suppose it means that she often feels ""removed"" from everything around her)
- An intensely negative view of her own body
- Stress dictating what mood she's in more so for her than anyone I know / have heard of (She is a student, so all year round bar the summer holidays she is stressed and ultimately upset)
- Constantly being exhausted
- Other symptoms linked with depression such as self harm, suicidal thoughts and a lack of interest or passion in almost anything including activities she used to enjoy when she was younger.

So far, I think that first of all she has severe depression. I also think she suffers from borderline personality disorder or depersonalization/dereialization, or maybe a combination of the two.

Obviously, I know that I can't diagnose her, and I also know nobody here can diagnose her either. That's not what I'm trying to get from this post. I just want to better understand where, for example, I could look for to help her (the help that one could give someone who has BPD may not be as useful for someone with DP/DR).

110,"I’ve been depressed for the past 2 years. I finally got the courage to talk to my parents and ask for a therapist but they refused


I’m 15 years old (F living in New York) and to be clear it’s not like my parents are bad parents. They just have a lot of misconceptions about mental health. For example how people who seeks therapy are all “crazy”, depression is just a phase, anti depressants will make you kill yourself, and colleges won’t accept you if you’re seeing a therapist


I’ve tried everything to convince them and disprove their misconceptions but everything falls on deaf ears. They have the “parents know best” mentality and it’s really frustrating.

As a kid and teen I was always extremely sensitive and started to cry pretty easily. I was bullied quite a bit and people could not understand why I would cry when I was just genuinely mad, which made things even worse. When I was like 15 years old, I started smoking pot regularly with my mates and I think it kind of numbed me to the point where I stopped having these outbursts.


Now that I've started a job and got into adulthood, I stopped smoking as much because I can't just show up high on the job. This lead to me becoming more ""fragile"" again. When I do something wrong and someone calls me out on it, I can't help myself but start crying. It's extremely embarrassing to say the least and is causing me a lot of pain and shame.

118,"Well- this is my first reddit post and one of my last resorts. 

My entire life has essentially been nothing but me picking up survival techniques to deal with my abusive parents. I do not feel as if i ever had the opportunity to develop as a person. I don't have morals, values, a personality, nothing. I am going to be 21 this upcoming September, and it dawned on me this year that for a large part of my life (since i was 11), i have been relying solely on my interpersonal relationships for a sense of self, and when they leave i am destroyed and i ""lose my mind"". I then sit around and mope until i find another person to obsess over and to give all of my obsessive love.. its an ugly cycle that i want to break. I want to become a person, i want to become an individual. I just have no idea where to start. Nothing in my life is currently for myself, and i am scared to change anything. I go to school to make my father happy- if i wasnt doing that i would be completely lost. I do not even really invest myself in school, i just enroll and manage to barely get through.. because i am told that is what im supposed to do. Im getting too old to be continuing on like this, i dont know what is going on. I am a big liar, not maliciously. No one knows me, im scared. Everyone knows the version of me that i create for them, so much so that i am terribly afraid for my worlds to overlap. I cant sustain this, i do not see a feasible way to cohesively merge these worlds. I dont know what is real. I often spend my times high out of my mind on marijuana (I dab frequently to deal with everything, and at this point im addicted) and i just sit around and idle, day dreaming about what i wish my life was. I fall in love with false ideas, and get hurt even harder. I feel crazy, I feel like a shell of a person. I sit here everyday and like.. watch myself get worse. I dont know where to start, how to start, what to do, none of it. I feel like i have absolutely no one, cause no one knows me and if they really knew what was going on inside of my head they would be afraid.

120,"First time posting here, and I typically try to avoid writing like this, so I know I'm going to miss a full description of how I feel, but I won't bog this down with a needless preamble.

So I know I haven't been feeling emotionally well lately. It's been particularly bad for I think the past two weeks (though time is such nebulous concept at this point that something I thought happened a week before was actually three). The thing about it though, is that I've always been able to sit down, perform my job, and not really let on that anything is affecting me. I've just felt continually, though vaguely, grim, tired at all times, and unfocused throughout each day. I also typically feel I'm not worth other people's time, and I might withdraw suddenly and get wrapped up in my thoughts.

In actuality, this is probably how I've felt for most of my life. It was fairly prominent in High School, but I didn't really give myself any time for feeling hopeless in college. I think it's sort of crept up on me in the two years I've been in my current job after graduating (first year actually felt really great since I was confident in my skills and appreciated the challenges). I've always been a workaholic (yet lazy at home), since I was a teen and got jobs during the summer. I like being able to bury myself in a task until completion. It's like an agreement I have with myself: ""I will be productive from the hours of 8:30 until 5:00"".

But as I said, even though I'm still able to do what is needed of me, I'm not exactly feeling ""razor sharp"". It even happened yesterday where I remembered a ticket I had from the previous week, and asked my supervisor to help me troubleshoot it (I work at a Help Desk, should have mentioned). Only it turned out I had already closed it, after I   
contacted them and they stated it was now working. I felt pretty embarrassed and found it odd that I would have a memory skip like that.

This morning when I came in, I was wondering about why I've been like this, why I've been mostly able to work well, but might lose a bit of focus. I know I haven't had a major depression, like some people I know who get bedridden for weeks/months, completely withdraw socially, might self-harm or have suicidal thoughts (actually I wouldn't want to die, but to suddenly stop existing or enter a coma are thoughts that pass my mind. Those probably seem like the same thing though?). My heart &amp; support go out to those people, they are my friends &amp; fellow humans, but these types of actions wouldn't work well for me, as I feel I always have to keep busy with work, or video games in my spare time. I've always thought I'd be selfish for claiming to have a problem without experiencing those things. I thought my mental health was kind of just self-regulating, where I'm still able to do these things, so I must be fine. ""I'm functioning"", my brain said.

But that word stuck out to me today. ""Functional"". Like a functional alcoholic (which I am not), is it possible to be functionally depressed? A few minutes of Googling later, I read a few pages, and it seems to describe what I've dealt with, things like low mood, no relief, able to work reasonably, but unfocused. One resource I found says it must be professionally diagnosed after consistently feeling it for two years. It seems a bit long to me, and there are days when I'm happier than others, where I can feel good for a while. I guess I don't want to immediately self-diagnose on the internet, since that tends to be inaccurate.

But after just learning that that is a thing, I kind of feel that ""weight off your shoulders"" feeling. Like, it's just nice to be able to conceptualize what it might be in my head. If anyone has any input, that would be appreciated. Even just questions to help me flesh this out better would be good.

Stay well everyone, thanks for listening, and I hope whatever your troubles are go easy.",07May2019,1

123,"I am going to be 21 this upcoming September.. and upon a lot of speculation I have come to the conclusion that I am not that great of a person. Don't get me wrong, I am very much so depressed.. but I am not saying this from a depressed viewpoint. I genuinely am not a good person right now. I am toxic, obsessive, insecure, manipulative, a liar, etc. Believe it or not, I do none of these things maliciously but rather out of insecurity and fear. I have a VERY irrational fear of abandonment that stems from past abusive relationships that I have experienced as well as from my emotionally unavailable parents. It is very hard for me to genuinely care for people, but when i do i become borderline obsessed with them. They become ALL i can think about, all i involve myself with, literally. I will sit there for days and they will be the #1 thing on my mind, that and all the ways i could possibly secure that relationship with them. Of course for the other person they see what i want them to see, the good parts. It probably feels great to them when really i am not in love at all, i am in limerence. I involve myself with this person so much so that my own life + function will be severely stunted. I will wear myself absolutely thin and broke tending to the needs of my LO (Limerent object) all while exhausting myself more to hide the effort and exhaustion. 

I am not a good friend. I frequently feel alone, and i complain about it a whole lot. For a long time i would rely on my 'friends' as therapists almost shamelessly. I did not care, i absolutely returned the favor but not once did i ever consider that my mental load was not something i should keep to myself. I did not consider peoples boundaries, and while i see that they are there now i still do not always adhere to them. 

I steal, from anyone really. If it benefits me and does not affect anything (and this is subjective, i operate with my personal definition of 'not affect')  i will take it. I cheat, i lie. 

I keep all of my emotions and just literally everything inside; and i get brokenhearted and just upset when other people dont realize how i am feeling. It really doesnt make any sense to me, i just feel as if nothing i feel matters anyways so i keep it to myself until it blows up in my face. 

 I realize this, and i do it time and time again. I am tired of it though. I know that i am not crazy, i just have a sad, scared, insecure child deep down inside of me that i need to deal with. Is it possible for me to.. change completely? I have great intentions, i know that. I love deeply and genuinely.. i just am lost right now. I feel as though i need to type out more about myself for anyone to really.. ""understand"".. but it is just so complicated. I want to develop a sense of self, morals, values, i want to be a better person for myself and everyone around me.

No Mental Illness / No Addictions / No Criminal

**HOW  I GOT TO THIS POINT**:

I left my wealthy, abusive, Narcissistic, controlling, status conscious, judgmental, r-wing, elitist family. I was the scapegoat. I was the cause of all the problems in the family. I caused the alcoholism, excessive shopping, wealth hoarding, backstabbing, ""what will the neighbors think"" beliefs. I caused the addictions, lies, gaslighting and campaign smears.

I'm being sardonic. But that is how they were.

I wasn't wired that way. I associated with people who were different than the one's I grew up with. My family removed all photos of me in the home &amp; told me to never come back.

I also had intense private pay, out of pocket therapy with PhD's &amp; M.D.'s who suggested I leave them lest I commit suicide over their push-pull, bullying, &amp; abusive mind games.

I struggled on my own. I  never had roommates except in boarding school and college.  I was able to use my knowledge developed from college and work, &amp; keep an apt, a new car, and pay off the undergraduate loan and embark on a Masters that I completed many years ago. I was fit, pretty, in shape, wore cutesy clothes, makeup and fun fashion accessories. I felt alive.

I never married. The men I dated thought they were marrying a woman whose father earned a 6-figure income, and that my parents would supply this lavish wedding, and provide the down payment on our first house. That wasn't the case. My belief was, ""He &amp; I will do it ourselves, IF we choose to make a lifetime commitment."" Men left me, once they found out, I was not attached to my roots.  Most people stay attached to their families. I did not.

I never dated anyone who supported my ambitions, goals, and healthy lifestyle habits; free of drugs, smoking, &amp; excessive drinking. I had a desire to continue to develop my mind through academic pursuits. I attracted alcoholics, and controlling men who ended up using me for sex, and belittling me in the end, and discarding me like my family did.

**WHERE I AM NOW**:

Kicked out of Corporate. I didn't foresee a short shelf life. I didn't foresee that I'd never get married. (I never wanted children). I didn't foresee middle - age health issues.  I had a health issue and I needed surgery. Only women of childrearing years get protections. NEW employees who just start a job do not. I filed an EEOC for discrimination to try to keep my jobs and was pushed out anyway. My bosses at those times were Millennials, no college, married with children. The Co's wouldn't allow me into management and promoted from within. Most got to management because they stayed with the same employer since their 20's. (living the traditional route, marriage, children, close to family of origin). I didn't have the family thing going on. I was working and excessively learning to bury my pain. And the employers didn't want me to out compete anyone who was laid back, family centered and just there to collect a paycheck.

In retrospect, for my generation, Corp politics was like my family's politics. Show loyalty, conform, squash any sense of uniqueness, fulfill your gender's expectations (women marry, have children, take pink collar jobs, husband runs the house, women peter out on their career ambitions) stay slender, keep good dental, beauty, &amp; health hygiene.

Married people achieved upward mobility back then, more than a middle aged, never married person. My education became irrelevant. It was political, it was cultural, marrieds with children fit with the social norms of most Co’s and they were put on career tracks. I was put down, and sabotaged by female bosses who hated the single, Type-A gym rat who was self-disciplined and ambitious. Men who had these traits succeeded. Women were expected to have children, and enjoy cooking, baby showers and bake sales. I never had a mentor or anyone who wanted me to succeed. I already came from the world where people were working their way UP to.

Now, I'm far BELOW where they started. And they see that. And no one will help, or open a door of a career opportunity. I can't do it alone. It takes start up money, fiscal planning, and people who will patronize me. It takes connections with the right people.

**NOT ELIGIBLE**:

SSI/SSDI &amp; Medicaid. Let's put this off the table. I don't qualify. It's not an option. If you need to know those details, there are people in the SS and Medicaid forum who can confirm this. Or check your State's guidelines. The Gov't doesn't take care of people. It doesn't keep anyone above a subsistence level. It may keep you from starving, with food pantries and food stamps. Sec 8, affordable housing; read your State's HUD guidelines. This is for people who ""qualify"" and who commit to Gov't control over income limits; for a single person avgs $22,000/yr or less. I don't qualify to work in jobs at that pay rate.

**WORK**:

I didn't earn my Masters to work low wage, mindless, jobs. I've tried them in my survival mode for the last 3 yrs. They were ""dead-end,"" &amp; ""didn't qualify me to rent or buy &amp; use healthcare."" I was dying slowly as I was working 10 hr days below $15/hr. It resulted in EEOC lawsuits which I settled. This is how Corp can PHASE OUT OLDER WORKERS. Nothing I could do, could stop the push out. My bosses were younger, with little to no education. I didn't belong.

We can't not force ourselves into environments where we do NOT belong.

Employers pass over the older worker who is overqualified because they don't want me using the job as a stepping stone. They don't want to train someone who is going to ""keep looking"" and who obviously can't make ends meet (while chronically stressed) on LOW pay.

**MAYBE**:

I was contacted recently via EMAIL by a 3rd party company out of State, who MAY have a client who MIGHT want to hire me on a CONTRACT assignment. It pays approx $40.00/hr which was my avg pay range. That would permit me to rent a hotel room or find short term housing. It's a big IF. I've been out of work, and that has caused me to feel like shit, overweight, tired, hopeless, while floundering in prior jobs that were not stable, and would not allow me to plant roots. **FACT**: Some recruiters lie, so I'm prepared. I've been presented to jobs ONLY to make the recruiter look good to their client, with no intentions of ever hiring the older woman.

Older people are ""check boxes"" for many jobs, for EEOC purposes.

I will know in ONE to TWO weeks at the most.

If nothing comes through, I'm ending my life. I literally can't take ""surviving"" like this anymore.

I will never understand WHY people who live panhandling and sleeping under bridges with no hope for a better future, continue to stay alive. I know I could never do that.

Others have family and feel the need to hang in there for that.  They are fortunate.

I have nothing. I'm invisible right now, living off of a dwindling savings, and unable to work shit jobs because they don't cover 'housing and healthcare.' Again, see HUD &amp; Medicaid. And they are gas money only with no upward mobility. Subsistence level living with declining health. I've already tried and they ended up with lawsuits settling to get me out. You have to have your basic needs met to work 8 hrs a day. And you need to fit the culture of the environment.

**MOVING**:

I've done this when I was younger and employable. You need to be employable and have a plan before doing something so radical. I'm beyond picking up and driving to the West Coast or Mid-West, to places I don't know anyone, and no job lined up. Nothing is cheap. Avg rents across the U.S.A. are $1000+ for a 1BR. Room rentals are for younger people, migrant workers, and NOT for people with my confidential age-related health issues. I need SPACE, to grieve, to think, to walk around, beyond the confinements of a tiny bedroom that's stuffed with someone else's furniture &amp; that only fits a suitcase. I've tried it. One man sexually assaulted me and one woman was manic &amp; incessantly talked, and needed the dishes facing a certain way in the dishwasher. These were people from the world I wasn't raised in, who constantly watched TV, &amp; needed chaos and commotion to keep themselves from feeling lonely. I felt tortured.

That's WHY some people live in their cars and do the gym thing. That gets old, real fast.

**SOCIAL SERVICES / GOV't /Non-Profits**:

They don't help anyone back to lower-middle class living. They keep people above subsistence levels. Once you hit homelessness at mid age (with no pension, no 401-k), you'll never get back to stable housing, unless you get the prof'l paying job, or someone takes you in, or you find a reasonably sane person who is compatible and trustworthy to live with.

I've chatted with social workers, the told me they aren't trained to work with people like me. They are trained to help people with generational poverty cycles, who need life skills training, or who can qualify to live in Sec 8, or addicts, former felons, or untreated mentally ill etc..

It's not a ""beneath me"" issue. It's a fact.

Employers won't hire me to work low wage jobs. I've tried and they fire me because I don't know how to dumb myself down &amp; act excited to work while not enjoying the lifestyle I once had (Nice gyms, yoga, own apt, ironed clothes, makeup, fashionable accessories, hair curled and colored, while feeling like a competent woman).

I feel like shit. I'm don't dress like that anymore; no manis or pedis, no daily showers or rigorous fitness routine. I feel like I'm ONLY existing and things will not get better. Without my OWN living wage, it won't.

**MEDICARE**: Look that up too. I only have 10 -15 yrs left to work. I can't recover all that is gone. Social Security isn't enough to live on. It doesn't cover housing, a car, and basic needs to have a peaceful, enjoyable quality of life. Most people are retired in their 70's.",07May2019,1
125,"After waiting almost a year, I finally got an appointment to see my psychiatrist on the NHS and it was a disaster. I left feeling worse than before, and he was *awful* to me (accused me of basically drug chasing, cast doubts on my relationship, kept telling me that I was lucky compared to other people, that others were more physically disabled/abused more than me so I have no reason to feel like this, etc). 

Are they all like this?! Honestly, if it hadn't been for my SO I probably would have driven straight over the cliffs into the sea after the appointment, I felt that awful. I have nothing to compare it to though - so I don't know if this is par the course or an unfortunate one-off. I don't want to ever go back, which is probably the idea, but not because I feel better but because I feel so let down. I can't talk to my CPN/keyworker because he's now on holiday for a month, so it's just me and this horrendous soul crushing despair.

This has happened 3 times in work meetings where i'm fighting the entire time to keep my eyes open but then as soon as the meeting is over my energy levels snap back to normal immediately.

132,"I don’t mean in emergency situations. 
If I make an appointment to seek help for my anxiety I am afraid I will be drug tested and not receive proper care because of my marijuana use (illegal in my state). Most won’t prescribe medicine for anyone that fails a drug test. Especially not medicine with potential for abuse. I’m afraid I will be stigmatized as a drug user and be dismissed. But I literally cannot sleep without taking some sort of marijuana supplement before bed because my anxiety has gotten so bad. And up until now I’ve been to nervous to even go see a psychiatrist.

133,"I'm 16, I'm a normal teenager. But it was until recently that a friend of mine said I might have bipolar disorder, which I doubt a lot. 
There are many times I'm quite fine and all of a sudden I just cry. Cry is a big part of my life cause I cry EVERY SINGLE TIME when I get angry or pissed, that's why I have to control myself from being angry for no reason.

Over a year ago, I broke up with my ex and from then, I always think about sex (sex dreams, sex fantasies with literally anyone) although I've not had sex at all. 

There are times I'm incredibly dumb and there are times I become smart (like all my ideas come to me when I feel low). 

I talk a lot at school but not so much when I'm home, so sometimes I cry cause I don't have anybody to talk to at home, it's pathetic. I got tattoo when I feel low once, without second thought I just do it, haven't regretted it though. 

Also recently I've noticed that I get angry with my parents for no reason. 

Anger and sadness have taken all over me.

My family loves me, I live alone surrounded by fresh nature and I have a maid to do all of my chores. On paper everything is perfect but for some reason, I feel sad that I don't have the fire on things that I'm interested in like before.

138,"I have a friend with an adult ill son (bipolar disorder, unmedicated)who is threatening suicide since she did not respond to his demands. I dont know what to tell her, I'm fearful to say the wrong thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I know she is not resposible for his choices and so on but this is a big deal. He calls often to have her drive him without warning and ask for money and so on. He has even stolen her wedding and engagment ring. I do not know if he is an addict. He doesnt keep regular employment and lives with his father, who also ""demands"" things of his exwife, this kid's mother. We have been discussing the need to put boundaries up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since she said no to his ""leave work now and drive me home""  demand he says he will kill himself since no one cares, and so on. He has not demanded anyone else in his family run to his aid btw.

&amp;#x200B;

I know this can be a manipulation tactic but I am not his mother. My sister killed herself after threatening numerous times. I 100% know it was her choice and regardless of my actions that was still her choice. However, I cannot put this value onto my friend. We discuss not enabling in basic terms and not putting his demands above her needs and the needs of her family she is responsible for.

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice would be helpful, thank you.This is a specific situation but in general hearing how to handle this would be useful. It is something I run into time to time (I am a nurse and patients want drugs or they will kill themselves and so on).",07May2019,2

Has anyone tried online therapy (not classes, like individual therapy)? If so, do you recommend it and what was the cost?

I want to stop treatment and see if i can get bad enough they do something new, or be taken by illness...

My specialist does everything she can to help me, but the cough came back again. I'm in week 4 of treatment and she is reluctant to give anymore steroids. 

If it follows the same pattern, I should develope pneumonia soon. This cough will last 3-4 months, with repeated or persistent infections. Then I get about 8 months of health, then the cough returns.

I've been in this cycle for about 15 years, and nothing stops the cough. It is loud, disruptive, persistant, and inevitable.  

I have 2 jobs but can't work. I don't qualify for disability. This cough and these infections hit so hard, the treatments hit hard, and I'm exhausted. 

Today I went to Urgent Care, and they told me what I already knew... I am taking everything I can. They took a chest x-ray that was clear and sent me home.

I'm exhausted and sore and nothing more can be done. This pattern is my life and I don't want to do this anymore.

155,"Posting here because she’s usually the person I talk to whenever I feel broken, and I can’t talk to anyone else right now. Last summer, my best friend asked me to officiate her wedding, which was last Saturday. I agreed and got ordained through the Universal Life Church. I ordered some documents from them as well, which included 2 marriage certificates. I stupidly thought that those were the same as marriage licenses, so I told me friend not to worry about that part. Fast forward to a week ago when I finally found out that they are different documents and that I didn’t have all the necessary information to help by filling out the application for the license. I immediately told my friend and apologized profusely. She said it was fine, that we’d just get this taken care of the Monday after the wedding. Neither of us knew that wouldn’t work, so I said okay. 

The wedding happened, and it was beautiful. Then on Monday just as I’m about to meet her at the office, she meets me out front and says that she already talked to someone and was told that the marriage license needed to have been obtained before the ceremony. She is practically in tears, and tells me that her partner is furious with me. I tried to comfort her as best I could, and I took full responsibility for misleading her in the first place. She tells me that while she accepts about 2% of the blame for listening to me and not checking all this with her spouse, she tells me in no uncertain terms that she blames me for the other 98%. 

She and I have been best friends since we were 12, and in 17 years I’ve definitely screwed up, but never this badly. She’s never been this angry with me, and there’s nothing I can do but wait and see if she’ll eventually let me try to fix this. The wedding was out of town for me, so I had to drive four hours home while sobbing and reminding myself that if I drove off an overpass like I was tempted to do, it would only mess up my friend’s honeymoon even more. I know I need help, but I just don’t know how to deal with anything right now. I tried calling my insurance provider for a list of covered therapists in my area, but I was told two different times that I had the wrong office/department and eventually I just had to give up because I couldn’t handle anything. 

My friend asked me to text her when I got home so she’d know I was safe, and I did, but I can tell she hasn’t read that text or the one I sent before that. I just don’t know what to do other than give her space, but I also really need support.

156,"I [M18] have been working as a slave at a department store for ~9 months and counting. Hating my job would be an understatement. It’s boring, degrading, and the stress is not worth the pay. I practically clean customers’ messes and assist them when they need help.

I wish I was privileged enough not to do this, but considering the fact that my mother is middle-class in NYC, I don’t have that luxury I wish I had. I would add that I deal with anxiety and depression. My psychologist and psychiatrist have helped immensely by teaching me coping skills to manage both diagnoses.

I’m going out-of-state for college this August and my mother wants me to work until the last day possible. I can not fathom the thought of that. I feel like she will come with an ultimatum: keep the job and I’ll help fund for college or no help will be given if you quit. Remember, this is just how I feel.

Hey r/mentalhealth! I got some potentially good news, so hopefully by the time this is posted, I will be able to fully share what has happened. I am doing only okay, and fighting my urges is getting to be very hard. They won't give me the medicine that had been prescribed by the same Counseling Center the Prison works with for mental health issues and they wonder why I'm having urges... duh! That is prison for you though, unfortunately. I have now been here 16 weeks and 6 days by weeks, and on May 3rd, two days from now, I will be here for 4 months exactly. It is time for me to go home. I have actually lost a lot of weight, thanks to my Anorexia and the lousy inedible food here! People keep saying I'm way too skinny. My lowest weight was 108 lbs and I think I might be close to that now. I don't WANT to starve. Hunger sucks especially when you have no money for snacks! I did have a job but then we moved to a different Unit (Fox to Bravo) and there are enough workers over here, so I'd lost my job. I did get paid a little though, so I will be getting some goodies tomorrow, which is Commissiary Day, or as we call it - Thursday afternoon is ""Christmas Morning"" here! So, I hope everyone is well. I will let you know if what I think might happen does actually happen. Love to all of you!

159,"Hi folks! Old user, new account. I just saw a new psychiatrist today and was confused by some of the things he said. I was initially there for depression alone, but we got talking about my paranoia, occasional hallucinations, and mild delusions. He put me on Wellbutrin, which I've had success with before, and wanted to meet up again in 2 weeks to see how I'm doing. He told me that he wants to see which symptoms go away along with the depression and which stay, because if certain things like the paranoia stay, then it might be a personality disorder. He didn't say which and I didn't ask. I've been diagnosed with borderline traits before (back when I was 15), but we went over the criteria and he strongly disagrees with that diagnosis, which was a relief because so do I. I'm just about 19 now and I don't know what to make of any of this.

If all the symptoms go away when my mood gets better, would that have been depression with psychotic features, or is that psychosis generally more severe? Which type of personality disorder would present as something like this? I'm not looking for anything definite, just a direction to do some research in so I'm not blindsided when I finally do receive a diagnosis. I'll take a look at any suggested readings, and anything to help me cope in the meantime would be very helpful as well. Thanks everyone!",07May2019,1

161," A little background before I get into the meat of this issue. I am severely depressed and have been (and was diagnosed so) at 7 years old. I am 31 now, and in all this time I have found only one therapist who has been able to help me. This therapist was only discovered by me in the last two years, and while I am not an amazing picture of good mental health, I am in a somewhat better position than I was two years prior.  

Now my current situation is that I have lost my therapist, who I will refer to as C, in the aftermath of a giant misuse of hospital funds (unrelated to C).

I can't do this for the rest of my life and the primary thing that is making everything worse, my finances, is just so far out of reach for me to fix.

163,"Hey all. I am a 25 year old mother who is hanging on every day for this Lamotrigine to work. I was diagnosed clinical depression at 15 after attempts  and was on lexapro up until Mania started rearing its head around 22/23. This is all so unbearable and I know you know. My fathers depression,insomnia, anxiety, and my mothers bipolar run deeply through me. I guess I was a little fucked genetically. I am not suicidal today, but I feel my mood swings have increased on Lamotrigine. My doctor told me to allow 5 weeks for it to build. I am. I just feel my symptoms have gotten dangerously worse and I see her in a week or so. Should I stop taking this? She mentioned trying Lithuim and I am just so worried Ill be a zombie.

165,"Not even sure if this is the right place to post this, r/mentalhealthadvice seems dead (most recent post is 4 months ago) and I can't find any other related subs, but somethings been bothering me off and on the past few months and I want to know if it's healthy behavior or if there's something else happening.

I've been having infrequent, but highly distressing daydreams, usually as I'm resting in bed, getting ready to go to sleep (though on one occasion I had it happen at work).

These are incredibly vivid, 45 minutes to an hour on average, events where I cannot stop about thinking about terrible things happening to the people I really care about, specifically loosing them somehow, usually a graphic death (Car accident and Murder to name some), or they become a missing person. I've had about 4 or 5 of these events in the last 8 months. Cried every single time. Usually it wouldn't affect me outside of the events, but now that I have to get up for work at 6am, it can really fuck up the next day if it happens the night before.

I'm wondering if this is infrequent enough that it's just an odd quirk of caring about people, or if it's something that could develop into a much worse thing that I should be keeping an eye on.

Thanks y'all!",07May2019,1

However, recently I've started becoming inspired to do things and get out there. I thank music for this. I've finally found a passion. I want to go to concerts, festivals, my friends performances, music lessons, shops. 

However my parents have always been overprotective of me. At first I never really noticed this because I was happy with never leaving the house. Now, at 17 I'm starting to resent it. Everytime I want to go out, my parents will ask my a ton of questions as to why I suddenly care about these things. In the end they tell me to forget it. So where do I go? Back to bed, of course! I know I don't have enough energy to argue so I fall back in bed and daydream that I've gone to these places. They're essentially enabling me to not go out of my comfort zone. 

My parents don't know I'm depressed, they think I'm lazy. Also they don't know what depression is and I can't explain it to them because they don't know english and I barely know punjabi - long story.

About two years ago I was diagnosed with cyclothymic disorder. Most of my life I can remember being depressed very often, sometimes over nothing. Any little thing could trigger dark moods that would last a few minutes or sometimes a full day. I am now on medication and it helps regulate my moods so much it’s amazing. The only thing is that my fiancé of a 11 years says I’ve been emotionless for the past 2 years... I guess I didn’t see it but now that I look back at those years it is true. Does anyone have any experience with this or any tips/tricks to help me out?

176,"All throughout my life I’ve known that there hasn’t been something right with my sister. I’ve been told stories form when I was first born my sister use to bite and scratch me because she didn’t like me being alive (for context my sister is 3 years older than). This got down to sibling jealousy as she wasn’t the only child anymore.

Fast forward to my very first memories and all I can remember are the screams and shouts of my sister as she cried and raged at my parents. I would sit in my room head under the covers and fingers in my ears singing nursery rhymes just to block out the sounds. To say she through tantrums was an understatement. These fits of rage and anger and crying were extremely constant throughout mine and her younger years. They happened at least 3 times a day at there worst. 

My parents did their very best to calm her down every time and to stop her and support her but it was to little success. These tantrums could go for hours. All the while I’m hiding trying to block out any and all sounds.

At the time her anger issues got put down again to being young and not knowing what to do with built up emotions and anger.

However come to the age of 15 and she’s still doing it. They could start from the littlest things. From being told off and using her tantrums as a defence mechanism to having something not go her way. Any slight reason to burst was enough. The only way I can really describe her outbursts were as if she was possessed. From horrible sounds and violent actions to full screaming she did it all.

Again her anger was put down to being a teenager and avoided again by my parents and those around us.

Just a couple a years ago now was the worst outburst I can remember. It got to the point of her hitting, punching and biting my mum (my dad now has a job where he works away and isn’t always around). I myself had to intervene as I’m pretty sure if I hadn’t then the police would be round our house at some point. 

She’s now 23 and as of tonight she’s just had another terrible episode. The wailing and the shouting is still the same as I remember all of those years ago. Granted the outbursts aren’t as often anymore but it’s still not right and natural for someone her age to be doing. I myself am a very levelheaded person and not a lot gets to me. However for the first time ever when me and my mum were alone she said she’s worried that this has effected my mental health and that she doesn’t want it to come back around to me in later life.

This really hit home for me today and although I know full well that I’m okay and that it’s not actually effected me I worry for my mums mental health after all these years and I certainly worry for my sisters.

I love my mum and my sister so much and I pray for them everyday. This has truly been hard for me to put down in words and I thank you so much for reading this if you got this far. If anyone out there has any idea what might be going on in my sisters head then please feel free to share your opinions.

Thank you, God bless you all.",07May2019,4
177,"Hey,

&amp;#x200B;

So this is my first year in university, joining with the excitement that any freshman could have. The moment i joined, I saw it as an opportunity to grow ever more in a different environment; left Bahrain to go to the UK for international study and essentially learn what my culture and my home could not teach me. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, for the first time in my life I've been experiencing trouble with my mental health. Anxiety attacks and severe and almost crippling insecurities, things i have never contended with in the first 18 years of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I really wanted to know whether some people are facing the same thing, and whether the fact that something's wrong in the modern educational system that's driving this.... with all of the evidence that's available to me... epidemic.

178,"Hey all. A while ago I started to decide to try and get my mental health sorted a bit. And it started with sorting out my anxiety. 

We were living with my inlaws, and MIL was invading my personal bubble in such ways that I was having what I would have called anxiety attacks, where I would go and hide in the bathroom and have an emotional breakdown because she had been in our room and it was no longer a safe space for me.

When explaining my anxiety to the mental health nurse (I think he was nurse level anyway, I struggle with memory) he seemed confused why I was focusing on this. He seemed to have it lodged in his mind that I had issues with worry. That I struggled in my relationship with my BPD partner because I was full of what ifs. Banged on about hypothetical worry. 

About my partner I kept saying; it's not an if 're relapses, it's a when. And I don't know if I'm able to deal with it again. I have anxiety because I'm reacting to his good times the same way I would react to his bad times. And I need to learn how to act differently.

But he focused on this what if scenario constantly. So I went through the motions, and knew most of the ""answers"" already. If I have a what if then I find a solution. If I get lost I enjoy the scenery. If my bus is delayed, ah well, nothing to be done about it now. Apparently I already knew alot about CBT. I wonder why when my BPD partner basically caused me to learn it to survive our relationship /s

So I guess I'm asking... Was I just put in the wrong type of therapy? Did I have anxiety? Is anxiety only about worry? That just doesn't feel right.

I felt like such a fraud coming out of it no better of then when I went in, but being such a people pleaser I couldn't refocus the sessions after my first few tries of ""hey, this is what I'm struggling with"" ""ok, but what about these types of thoughts""",07May2019,4

It's led me to believe that I'm transgender, that I'm gay, that I don't want anybody in my life. I have this obsession with needing 'to cut everyone out of my life.' For example, I lived in a house share I hated, and I didn't enjoy associating with my housemates, so my anxiety is telling me that 'well, if you didn't want to live there, and you didn't like your housemates, you have to tell them that you want to cut them out of your life so that they can see the real you, and so that they know you don't want anything to do with them.'

We just finished moving into a new apartment which of course would add to the stress, but things are settling down again but she is still just as bad.
