0,"Okay so just for some context, I have OCD, generalised anxiety disorder and chronic depression, I'm 17, going to college next year. I'm also FTM Trans but my parents don't want to deal with it or send me to a gender therapist, so thats that. My parents are narcissistic and I've made a post in r/raisedbynarcissists about them.

I've had this therapist for a while and I've connected pretty well with her but haven't gone in a while just because I haven't had any issues, but when I went to her today (despite me not feeling like I need to go). My parents have been really pushing the idea that I am not okay when I've been feeling fine which is MAKING me not okay, if that makes sense. Like constantly pushing that I'm not okay and that I don't know if I'm okay or not. The issue is that I'm upset because of this, and that now that my parents know that I'm trans, they keep making snide feminising comments towards me and its obviously upsetting.

So I go to my therapist and she keeps pushing that I'm not trans and that there's something causing my OCD to flare and make me think that I am trans, and while my OCD is flaring, I can tell (because it's my brain) that the 'trans thing' as they like to call it, isn't rooted in my OCD. The 'trans thing' is around when I'm at 100% and definitely makes things worse when I'm not at 100% because I hate my body and all that fun stuff.

But the big issue here is that my therapist keeps pushing that I am not well and that it's not because of my parents, and that it's not because of the trans thing, but because of something else. Finals are over, I've got a job, I'm accepted to a college, I'm attending the college, and I feel good OTHER than these parental issues and their problems. To make things worse, the therapist keeps pushing that my mother is in my corner and looking out for me and blah blah blah, but I know that's not true.

I'm due to see her again in a week and I really don't want to go back because I feel like she's just telling me what my mom wants her to say. I don't know what to do because I can't say anything to my mom because then it'll be just 'she's not telling you what you want to hear and sometimes that's her job' but there are a lot of things that she said that I know for a fact aren't true, and she didn't listen to a lot of things that I had said. 

Any advice would be much appreciated.",21May2019,1
1,"The year was 2016, I was 16 out of school for a month after getting severely bullied and attacked by 3 girls in my year, no friends and I had so much home troubles i was getting told I was crazy or a bad person due to rage induced outbursts at home. I had nothing hated myself and wanted to die, but I couldn’t die knowing they where getting away with it so I had a plan, a plan to inflict as little damage as possible so I was gonna wait till they where all in the same lesson Wednesday 4th period science I would separate them so I didn’t accidentally hurt anyone else then I was going to kill myself if I got caught I would just kill myself in jail all I knew was that I was not going to be alive on Friday, now I’m not going to say I had some Epiphany or someone made me see it was going to be ok or anything what did it for me was I was watching a full house episode and I wished I was those people I was so jealous and I cried for a solid 2 hours cut myself and decided that they would never do that and that if I wanted to be like them I can’t do that, my mental heath still hasn’t been fixed since then I’ve had 4 attempts on my life and spent a year out of school but I’ve left school and am in college working towards becoming a teacher so I can help students not feel like this I have a clear Conscience and have my freedom and I saved a whole lot of people from a trauma and after all the shootings in America am ashamed I ever considered doing something like that. My reasons for saying this is that you WILL regret it 2 you will hate yourself more for it and find the one thing that keeps you going on.

2,"So, lemme start this off with saying that I am 14 and have been struggling with my low self esteem and socializing with people. I have a really high pitched voice and have been bullied for years on a constant base because of it. My parents have been divorced since I was 3 and my stepdad and mother have been physically and mentally hurting each other for the past few years. My mom purposefully yells at me and tears me down to the point where I actually consider suicide. Anyways, ever since I joined my freshman year started I have dreaded waking up to go to school at 6 in the morning until 8 hours later when I get out at 3. During these cruel 8 hours of my day, I consistently worry about what people think about me. I always think of the worst case scenario cause of it and my self esteem takes a huge blow cause of it. My teachers don't care about their classes and only give us worksheets throughout the entire day. We also get up to 2 hours of homework everyday on top of that. I have missed almost 15 days because of this and can't miss anymore or else I fear that the truancy officers will give my parents a fine and I'll take the beating. My mental health has suffered from all of this and I have been forgetting a lot more information cause of all the stress lately. I've brought up multiple times to my parents that I can't take highschool anymore and that I want to take homeschooling. My mom was okay with it but my dad completely disagrees and worries about my socialization despite me not having any friends and not wanting to talk to people at all. The only way I cope with this is through my computer and video games. I'm able to talk to people online anonymously and not have to worry about my appearance or how I speak. I feel free when I'm able to be on my PC and have spent most of my freetime everyday being on it. Now let me mention my grades. I've gotten 2 D+ despite me getting A's on my tests. My dad told me that I can no longer have my PC until my grades are up. I honestly don't think it's fair especially since 1) I have social anxiety and stress everyday from school and have told him that I can't stand being there. 2) My sisters both have F's and have received no punishments. (One of them has 3 F's). And 3) I have been diagnosed with ADHD type 2 and have no medicine cause my dad doesn't believe that I have it yet my mom does. What do I do? I don't know if I'm entitled or if I should be seeking help. I just need some insight into my situation.",21May2019,1
3,"I've always been angry. As I've grown older, I'm 31 BTW, its gotten better. Lately my anger has been creeping back. The difference is now I don't really have any outlet, so it feels like I'm a caged animal or something. I'm scared because my girlfriend of 5 years doesn't know this part of my life. I dont know if I have some kind of mental illness or if I just being a pansy like I've always been told. I feel like sometimes I'm about to snap and lose control.

Recently been struggling a lot, I'm still not completely over a sexual assault I went through 3 years ago, there are times when i think i'm over it and something will trigger me and bring it all back. Also dealing with failing my uni degree, can't bring myself to tell my family through shame, I worked so hard but recently after the death of my uncle around a month ago i kind of gave up, i've lost a couple of great friendships and a relationship due to money issues and not being able to talk to anybody about how i'm feeling so i've ended up resorting to relapsing by self harming again and drinking almost everyday.

9,"My 30 yr old bf doesn’t know what he’s doing with his life (his words). He admits to struggling with anxiety and depression. He hasn’t pursued higher education/university yet because he isn’t sure what he wants to do. And he worries even if he thinks he knows what he wants to do, he might end up not liking it, and thus 4 years of college would be wasted. But he has anxiety because he’s already “old.” He has over-worry and fear of everything in life and the inevitable death of human life stresses him out. He says he still doesn’t know what he wants out of life, considering we are all going to die. All these fears paralyze him. He says he struggles committing to one thing. I’m his first girlfriend (he only had fwb before). He spends a lot of time escaping / procrastinating by playing video games. He does smoke marijuana to calm his brain’s anxieties. He still relies on his parents financially for certain things (although he does live alone). 

Are these all red flags?

12,"Do you have people in your life that berate and insult you one day (being completely serious), then turn around and behave like they are your friend the next day and act like they were just kidding? 

I am not talking about people that truly are your friend and call you names in a brotherly/sisterly way. Not the people that greet you with ""Sup, fuckface?"", but the people that never say anything nice about you but act like they are your friend. I'm talking about the people that one day will sit and have lunch with you and crack jokes but the very next will be jabbing at your intelligence and picking at your insecurities.

These are toxic individuals who make themselves feel better by putting other people down. They do this because they themselves are extremely insecure and make themselves feel better by being emotionally sadistic shits towards others. You are better off without them. If you absolutely have to keep the façade going (especially in the case of coworkers), limit your exposure to them and remember that YOU SHOULD GIVE ZERO SHITS ABOUT WHAT THEIR OPINIONS ARE.

Hi

Im writing to you because with an issue. My name is Patrick, Im from Ireland.

I suffered depression lately when a very odd relationship ended on Instagram. I met this woman through posts of a band I had put up online who we both liked, and she friended me 1st and then I did back to her as she looked like quite an interesting character. She is the owner of a nightclub, private dj, a choregrapher, stylist, interior designer,  motorcycle enthusiast and everything inbetween.

So it was quite a whirlwind. She came along and from the getgo told me everything about herself, within a month she told me her whole life. The relationship was from Feb 4th till Apr 15th. 

However I soon discovered this woman was seriously flawed and the stories she told me quite a lot were fiction based on fact...the truth, but only 60%. We would communicate by messaging each other by insta text, audio voice and even video.

I am coming for guidance because I feel guilt over revenge I took out on her when she blocked me. I feel I have dyslexia or something undiagnosed and even narcissist and so was she a bit. One thing she couldnt stop doing and said she loved to do was boast.

Over the course of our friendship we had the most intimate and bizarre conversations. Both of us Geminis. We felt like we were soulmates. Shed go on about how sensual she was and all the men and sexual encounters she had and how she was engaged 9 times and she'd cop out of them and how men have been bad to her and had to hide the fact they used her as she has money and a dj as she had somewhat of a priviledged upbringing. she would go on about her ex who co-ran the club about how violent he was but had in the beginning said good stuff about him and then changed that he gave her 3stds..went off with someone else and got married, was crap at helping out at the club, and she then became a silent backer due to paranoia. I could keep going. 

Everyday there was chaos, she had a sleepwalking problem and got attacked, a premature baby and her parents said something was wrong, pancreatitis, and several car &amp; motorcycle accidents...a bike accident in 2014 where sustained a dislocated leg and a slight brain injury where she says she gets seizures but then stopped taking her meds and went on this crazy diet, so no idea how her health is being a dance teacher. Simply too much to handle.

Shes also moved 24 times in 25 years and has had 25 cars. Nutz! She is only 41. 

A groundskeeper was supposed to have sexually assaulted her. Which i think is only partly true where the propery management of her former apartment treated her bad..but definitlely no assault, but she hadnt spoke to me in 2 weeks cos of it.

Apparently she found out when she looked after her granny she that with the drugs she was given admitted she was adopted. Also has tried to hang herself twice and her therapist allowed her decorate there wedding? She brought her bengal cat into a bar on St Patricks Day on a date and the cat bit her date 😂

She always kept changing the subject when youd ask her questions and a lot of the stuff shed say you had your suspicions but cos i was into her and she into me we would let each other away with murder with what we say but in the last few weeks that banter just got too much, and she sent me another message and being tired I read it ever so slightly wrong. I read it in such a way combined with a query that had been on my mind for a long time and in the quirky way we would write to each other that she blocked me and quite rightly so. Problem is I still have respect for her somehow, and never had feelings like this before..and im 37.

I had asked her bout her dad and her being adopted, but at the time I was feeling low and the way I made out the text was kind of like an underhanded subconcious character assasination. 


I could keep going on till the 12th of never bout her, but I ended up telling her my life story but found to be in a confidence bubble and I think when I told her bout my life and how low I was feeling she would say stuff to me in a way that would make me doubt myself because my life has been disastrous and have lack of confidence. She works 3 jobs..I havent worked in 10 years..I felt like an object..a pawn..yet I let her get away with it cos I probably am a lonely narcissist and as she said guys get infatuated with her and would say these passive statements bout how shes dealt with situations, and about how great she is to probably test out guys to see how they are..she even would in a carefree way go on about how sex wasnt an issue...I fancy you...we could get married...have you as arm candy...please come out to Houston Texas where I am. She told me one night she did something similiar like that to a date. But I told her cos of being from Ireland and no passport Id keep it to friends. There clearly was no boundaries.


As I had mentioned about her lies, she had then come back to me after I had been blocked and said that because she moved apartments that she deactivated her account which was untrue as I opened up a new acc and there she was...it was an all out block.


A part of me in the back of my mind thought that this sort of rift could happen, as ive had people treat me poorly and years ago had been to a psychiatrist and told me that I had a low iq and had to protect myself from anyone who might take advantage of you. So in the beginning of our socalled friendship she had said something to me that made me guarded...and cos these chats were so interesting I recorded them using Mobizen. 

We had great chats but I then started researching about her and this club cos she had kept it secret. One night after weeks I hit paydirt and what she had told me about her education was a slight mistruth..or rather putting fiction on fact as the information made more sense instead of her blown up elaboration. 


Anyhow I queried her on it. And it she just brushed it off. So similiar to that a few weeks later after she blocked me I kind of flipped out.So much so that I had to speak to someone else about it as this was the 1st time in my life I have ever been truly traumatised by an event. And what scared me is how it all unfolded..how we were so close..how I felt like she never really cared for me, so I took it upon myself to get in touch with a guy she told me not to speak to, he was her date and they went to this concert. I had asked him how you get these VIP tickets and I told him what she said bout him...everything she told me was a pack of bs.

Im like, why would you a pick a stranger online and bother to fill someones head with stuff like that? where you dont have to say anything.


My fears had come to light that she was an allout liar and felt I should get my revenge which I taught out long by insta messaging her team at her nightclub of people at the club what she was like and posting certain pics she had sent me with this anonymous account. 

So I wasnt expecting anything...i was filled with rage..confusion..loss...she then unblocked me...phoned that date of hers...he got back to me...and then the end of her abuse started and then and only then she showed her true colors not excepting the truth of her lies. It ended bad.

So to makemyself feel better when the dark depression oddly crept in a week later which im only starting to come out of trying to compartmentalise everything I delved further into her past...and found out more lies to convince myself shes a bad person cos its hard for me to bury her in my head. She is streetwise..Ive had a sheltered life and we live in 2 separate worlds as ive explained so shes definitely moved on, but the reality of what she said of her owning her own club was tainted after id done. And i feel tainted too, possibly the worst thing Ive ever done. An argument that stemmed out of not understanding that her parents back then especially in a biblebelt area like Texas were 2 teens, her mum had her older brother at 16. 

Her not fully opening up with the truth only made matters worse filling my head with suspicion, i think having young parents didnt help matters.

I hate that its almost like borderline stalking, she even slightly did it with me checkin how many friends i had at one stage.

Long story short, how could you analyze both of us and the relationship.",21May2019,1

Ok little context, for most of my life I've had ALOT of gut fat from laying around and eating everything i could find. Up until recently I've wanted to lose it but i didn't care that much. 
Several months ago my family went on this diet called Keto and i started to lose weight. Recently, when i moved back to Mississippi that weight loss started to slow, i wasn't that bothered since i was really close to an average weight for my height and age, but i didn't like it. Then i gained weight back. This bothered me, alot, it was only 3 pounds but i was so close to average weight.

18,"I had another family member, albeit distant, pass this evening from suicide. 

Because of the stigma, it was kept hidden from the rest of the family and I feel the need to speak this evening.

I don't say any of this without having been *there* because **I have** been there.

I'm not a mental health expert and will never try to claim such but I want to take this time to discuss my profession and also a lot of problems we see with mental health and I sincerely want to help. In most cases, this won't apply to you but at least hear me out.

I get notifications when anyone on Reddit uses the terms ""security clearance."" More often than I want, I find myself seeing comments here saying people will lose their security clearance if they simply seek mental health treatment. 

This is simply far from the truth, and in fact I've listed detailed information on my profile how that simply isn't the case.

I also have to terminate clearances. I term them for a variety of reasons, in almost all cases, you have to sign to be debriefed.

Except in one case. Death.

I have to explain why I cannot get your signature.

Nothing pains me more than to term someone because of suicide. Why? Because I am supposed to be your contact. Your independent person. The person who can help navigate you on what to do. To tell you things will be okay and how to approach it.

Of course this is just relative to clearances and such but it hits to the bigger point:

It's perfectly okay to talk about it.

This stigma has to stop.",21May2019,1
19,"Recently I’ve been having a lot of issues with my mental health. They’ve always been there but they are just coming back out to visit now. In the past I’ve turned to my sister and she sometimes says that it’s too much for her. So I’m trying to avoid going to her for this stuff. I had accidentally caved and called her one night, before hanging up. She called and demanded I tell her what was going on. She then said “I don’t want you to feel like you can’t come to me with this stuff, I just don’t want to be the only thing you are leaning on.” 

I’ve really only got my sister. Family that I’ve talked to have all sort of abandoned me or let me down in some way. We got very very close with each other and now she’s my only support system. I don’t want her to be the only person that I go to, it’s clear that it I will overwhelm her. However I feel like I have already put too much of this current bout on her. I really need her because I’m losing. She started a relationship with someone recently and I know it’ll mean she’ll have less time for me. Knowing this is also contributing to my mental state. How do I move on without using her as a crutch?

I talked to her about this and she is very understanding and supportive and trusts me, despite being a victim of assault.

I'm just worried that the doctor might think I'm dangerous. I'm a small, scrawny trans dude (pre-everything) with no criminal history so I definitely don't appear intimidating. I'm just worried, my brain is scary.",21May2019,1

22,"Hello to all,

For two years, I worked one of the hardest kinds of work I can imagine existing. I worked in several residential youth care facilities, where ""wards of the state"" (parents lost rights, kid is in custody of the state) lived until they either turned 18, were adopted, or were sent to another facility (such as a psychiatric hospital, where many would take brief trips here and there). While there were many positive experiences I had with working with those youth, the conditions those kids lived in were awful. I'm here today to (finally) share what I experienced in these facilities.

The first agency I worked for was over and above the worse of the two, by far. The buildings themselves were part of the problem. One thing I remember more than anything that I know affected the emotional/physical health of the kids I worked with was the *smells.* Imagine waking up, eating breakfast, going about your day, showering, and going to sleep *in a place that smells like piss.* This isn't a normal, I eat kale and drink 4 gallons of water a day healthy piss. This is piss that's probably been soaked into carpet for too long, coming out of kids on more medications than I can count on both hands.

The furniture in the places I've been in is not what I'd call normal furniture. It was either made out of heavy plastic, or with heavy wooden frames. This was a benefit, most of the time, because if a youth became escalated it meant the furniture was harder to pick up and potentially be tossed at you as a weapon. That said, the sharp wooden edges could become a potential danger if a fight broke out near them and you had to separate two angry teenagers all of a sudden. That heavy furniture could also be used as a barricade to block access to a given room in a ""dorm"" or ""house"" as they're often called (many of these places feature several of these large buildings, across a campus with several dorms). I've actually seen this happen once, in large part with the aid of a very poorly trained staff person.

We used radio's that we clipped to our belts to call for assistance if we needed help restraining (they called them ""managements"" and actually discouraged us from using the word restraint, but that's what it was/is so that's what I'm calling it) an aggressive child. Calls like that were frequent on a given shift, I'd respond to as many as 4-5 a day on average. One day, a call came out to help a dorm who had a youth who was threatening staff. We ran over and while they were dealing with that problem, they had a single staff watching several other of their youth in their living room to keep them separated from current problem. The problem is, this staff was poorly trained and not very psychologically healthy themselves.

This staff upset at least two of the several kids in that room. They decide it would be a good idea to leave the room once they've angered the kids to ""de-escalate"" the situation. The problem is, besides leaving around four incredibly traumitized youth from broken homes in the same room with no adult supervision, the furniture in that room lines up *just* perfectly with the only two doors into that room. The door to the outside and the door to the inner hallway line up just so that if you moved the two heavy wooden couch frames and lined them up, you can't open either door. Why? Because the doors open inward, so there's no way anyone except the hulk was getting in that room unless the windows were smashed.

Which they were, after about 30 minutes that felt like forever, the youth decided to start breaking the windows and putting shards of glass into their mouths/trying to hide them on their persons as weapons. The police had been called at this point, who came with tasers drawn to get control over the situation. The on-call supervisor at the time got chewed out by the cops. I understand why the cops were mad, they didn't want to have to come point a taser at a kid that we were supposed to be watching, but she didn't leave the kids alone in the room. She wasn't even the supervisor of that building, just the one charged with dealing with the mess.

I've been kind of just blurting things out for a bit, so I want to stop for a moment to reflect. These kids have been *failed* by the people who were supposed to love them. In many cases they were abused in some of the worst f***ing ways you could imagine. I've talked to kids who've been locked inside of freezers only to be let out by siblings who didn't want them to die. I've had therapists give me context as to why a child will be *gone* for an hour at a time while they scream and cry, because they were kept as a sex slave in some distant part of the world and actually kept inside a literal cage at age 8. Imagine arriving at *another* agency, foster placement, or otherwise and have *another* adult fail you. The staff who just left them in the room failed them big time, and created the opportunity for them to experience another traumatic (and potentially fatal) experience (what if they swallowed the glass they tried to hide in their mouths, or if they tried to attack the police?).

This particular staff had a history of failure, which is why I pulled very little with my comments toward them. If you have worked in this field and haven't screwed up, you've either not been working in it for more than an hour or you're some kind of savant. But this staff, like many others that I have tons of stories about, weren't learning from their mistakes. Sometimes their mistakes were accidents, either. Sometimes it was because the staff were as cruel as some of the people who've abused the kids.

One of the dorms I worked in served children with intellectual disabilities. One particular child had an issue with enuresis, where they would urinate on themselves at night and sometimes even during the day. This kid, who was much younger developmentally than their actual age, was a great kid when he wanted to be, and deserved better than what this staff called him - ""Tinkle."" Yes, you read that right. A staff who is supposed to be a therapeutic support to this child gave them a nickname mocking them for urinating on themselves. The staff also called them ""retarded"" on a regular basis, too.

For those wondering if I said anything to supervisors and leadership staff about any of this, the answer is *yes, yes, and yes.* I said it, shouted it, emailed it, wrote it, called it in, and most of the time it didn't mean a damn thing. Turnover in this occupation is incredibly high, so most of the time we didn't even have ""warm bodies."" We just had bodies, sometimes having those staff was worse than if we would of just been all alone because of how they would interact with the youth.

This is about all I have energy for tonight. I know this was scattershot and all over the place, but at least I've started. If this isn't the appropriate subreddit for this story, please direct me to where it is. I can write more about this if people want, and maybe the more I do it'll be easier to read because I won't write like I'm just thought vomiting on the page. Thank you for whoever bothered to read this and if you're a kid who grew up in an environment like this, I'm sorry this happened to you. You deserved better, and I hope your life is going as well as it can. No matter what choices your parents or the people who were supposed to take care of you made, you aren't their choices. You can always choose to be better. It isn't easy, but it is an option.",21May2019,2
23,"I am not sure how this works but right now I feel like my head is going to burst. I am sitting here on my bed and my partner is sitting right next to me watching a basket ball game on his tablet. He is nice, loves me and all but I can't help feeling like I am choking on something. I don't even feel like telling him how I am feeling. I don't even know why. it would hurt but its like I cannot feel anything. I want to melt away right here. its hard to breathe at times. I feel like I haven't felt whatever normal is in a long long while.

My partner is a good man but he is also very headstrong. like rn if I tell him to Lower the volume he willl just tell me to put ear plugs on or maybe ask me to go to the other room and do whatever I am doing. But I don't want to be alone coz I am losing my fucking mind. I want to be with him. this is the story of our lives. if I have to be with him I have to be on his terms else he will just tell me not be around. this makes him sound like an asshole, but he is generally not that. Like I am sloppy around the house and do not do a lot of housework because I go to grad school so he takes care of most things like household chores. so I cannot say that he is someone who does not care or give a damn about us or this relationship. He moved countries with me so I could go to grad school. But also he was not working back home so its not like he made a big sacrifice. We survive on my grad stipend and he does some basic hourly work which gets in some Money if not a lot. I feel he is frustrated about the fact that he does not earn but he is an able person and sometimes I feel like he does not want to work at all. I know it sounds contradictory but I can't make sense of it either. He shows he is trying and I clearly see him tensed every time our bank account is dipping low. He is 35 y/o now. I am 30 and we have been married 4 years.

&amp;#x200B;

he comes from money and his parents are kind of wealthy with a lot of property so sometimes he says he is not worried about money in the future. but I feel his parents are super controlling and by the time our finances stabilize, we will be really old and there will be nothing to do for us. idk what I am saying anymore. but I need to get this out. I am losing my mind. I wish he went to work in the morning so I could be more productive too. RN I keep feeling bad about him hanging out at home alone so I can't focus on my work and end up missing out on a lot of grad school work. I know the problem is with me that I should be able to detach and do my own thing but I cannot. I feel like I need him and inside, deep inside, I prefer to have him around and the fucked up way its unfolding. idk what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

we can only discuss these things to a point after which it becomes too intense and angry. he is super frustrated about being jobless and I don't want to make him feel bad about it and hurt his feelings. I did love him and chose to marry him against several odds. :( I want to cry and I want to be held and I want to be understood and I want to be allowed.",21May2019,1
24,"I feel like I have a problem and I do not know what to do about it. I think both of these things are related to the desire to control things in my life after a rough childhood but I don't know. First of all, I have such a weird attachment to stuffed animals that I can't explain- not even ones that I've had for a very long time, but just ones that I can associate with certain moods. Depending on my mood/what I'm doing/etc I will think about one of two stuffed animals that I have all day and then at night sleep with the stuffed animal depending on that. It is such a weird thing to be preoccupied by and I have no idea why I do this. I am 21 and too old to have stuffed animals anyway. I have so many other things going on in life and I feel like these strange thoughts are a waste of time and distracting me. Second, one of the only things in life that make me genuinely happy is my boyfriend and I feel like that is terrible. I plan my schedule around maximizing the time that I can spend with him because he is just my favorite person, but I think I am too obsessive. I worry about him and think about losing him and project my jealously/insecurity onto him. Sometimes I find myself unable to do things because I am worrying about him. I just want to be happy and carefree and not think about these insignificant things all the time. Both of these things seem to demonstrate a very obsessive personality and I guess I'm looking for advice to just live in the moment, enjoy life, be productive, and not focus on things that shouldn't be a big deal.

25,"I'm struggling so much. Everything that could've ever gone wrong in my life has gone wrong (abusive family, bad people in high school, deaths on deaths on deaths, bullying, sexual assaults, depression) and I think last year, having to run away from the city I lived in to go stay with my parents 3 hours away who I trust very little just to get away from my horrible, living nightmare of a boyfriend had really just been the epitome of it all. It feels like the final thing that I'm not going to bounce back from. I always tried so hard to be resilient and to keep powering and to keep trying to get to the next good thing and to become someone who thrives and now I barely survive. 

I couldn't stay at my parents any longer and I found a home to live in with my puppy that my ex wouldn't know anything about so I felt confident enough to return and try and finish my degree after a year long hiatus grounded in post-rape recovery, my normal mental health problems, and then ultimately a horribly abusive relationship. I wanted to just keep going I want to get my degree, its all I ever wanted and its everything for me if I am going to have any sort of a future. I even had meetings with the uni to tell them about everything that has happened, and to make arrangements so that I didn't have to take exams in the same room as my rapist and to have some support and it was so good and I felt so empowered. 

But I had an essay to do. I was too depressed to do it so I got an extension for a week. Then I got another extension for another week. It was due yesterday and I'm barely two paragraphs in and I just can't write anything. I can't do it and I just want to be asleep and I want to cry and I want to eat and I want to not leave my house and I want to be invisible. And yesterday I took my puppy to the vet because something was wrong with his ear and now I have to take him in to be sedated so that they can fix whatever is going on in it so he isn't well and I'm so sad for him I just want him to be healthy and happy.

This lasted about two to three hours.  He just starts talking about how I'm afraid of the opposite sex.

When he pisses me off or we have an argument, I f\*\*\*ing HATE him.  I think thoughts like, ""I should jump off the balcony / I hope I get hit by a car. THEN he'll be sorry"" or even ""I hate this relationship"", ""I  ""I hope he dies"".  I know, this is psychotic.  I'm otherwise a reasonable person who needs to talk problems over.

31,"this is my first time posting here. i dont post much on reddit at all really.. but i figure this is the place to do so on these circumstances.. sorry this will be long, so those of you who read through, i thank and appreciate you. 

im a stay at home mom to our 1 year old son. my s/o and i met just 2 years ago, immediately fell in love, and basically got pregnant right away. i had told him from the start that i have bipolar/depressive, borderline personality disorder, anxiety, and dissociative disorder.. which he didnt take seriously until he finally saw it at full swing.
its always given me issues with holding a steady job. i have a pattern of applying for jobs, getting hired for one, liking the first day or two, que the anxiety attack, walk out and quit/dont show up again.. and in between these jobs is a big gap of joblessness and doing nothing with my life. 
well, i actually worked for a little over a month after finding out i was pregnant, for a cleaning company, i cleaned a dentist office and comcast building 3 times a week. but i was a high risk pregnancy and lost it after calling out twice in one week. 
so we agreed no working, the doctor was serious about it too, so that made my anxiety go down a lot. then we found out also, at 18 weeks pregnant, our son had TGA (transposition of the great arteries) and would need open heart surgery after being born. 
my entire pregnancy went pretty well, we prepared ourselves for what was to come. i was actually super happy (besides the regular pregnancy hormones making me emotional) and extreeemely excited for our son to arrive! my s/o only got off work the first two weeks while we were in the hospital with the baby, the last two weeks i was there with the baby alone until we went home. i didnt experience any PPD, i’ve actually been steadily happy being a full time mom to our miracle baby! 
until recently... 
i forgot to mention, we moved out of our tiny ass apartment when our son was 4 months old, moved in with the MIL, until mid-April, her and i got in a huge fight, so we moved out, and in with my parents until we buy a house (he makes good money even with me being home). well, its really hit me since being at my parents that im not happy at all with my life. i put in a couple applications to get myself the fuck out of the house a few times a week, in the morning before s/o goes to work at 3.. 
i should also mention, me doing nothing with my life understandably causes tension between us at times. he wouldnt mind at all if i stayed home AND did online classes. which i understand! i love that he just wants to support me DOING SOMETHING WITH MY LIFE. how fucking hard is that to ask for? im just struggling with motivation. him and our son should be enough motivation alone, right? 
im not sure why i didnt find the time today, again.. but tomorrow im calling around to get in with a psychiatrist, and get back on medication. its been years since i decided i was done experimenting and refused anymore meds. well thats not working out too well, clearly.. 
i feel so ashamed, and irresponsible. here i was patting myself on the back because “iM eMbRaCiNg My CrAzY” and “people will just have to accept me as i am”, which isnt how that goes. this is not fucking okay, im not okay with being at this stand still. my family isnt okay with it, my fiance isnt okay with it, as he shouldnt be. these people in my life also, shouldnt have to put up with my outbursts, attitudes, snappyness, laziness, etc. just because they love me. yet they’re still doing it, like the troopers they are ): 

so, i have a few questions for those willing to answer:
1. what finally helped you get motivated?
2. was it medication? 
3. if you have similar diagnosis’, what meds work for you? 
4. how do you STAY motivated? 
5. what advice can you give me, from your own experiences?",21May2019,1
32,"Me and my wife have been having mini-arguments for awhile now (few months). Now that Im aware of it more, Its starting to really bug me of WHY we have these mini arguments. Also if they have been there all along. I'll try to keep it brief.  


Me  
\- History of depression, currently un-treated. Severity is up in the air due to a stressful environment.  
\- minor anxiety but I do get stiff neck and shoulders which cause me dizzyness (currently trying to treat).  
\- I personally feel like I have a horrible short term memory however I have learned new job related skills easily so it could just be me.

\- No history of bipolar, psychosis .  


Wife

\- Depression (currently treated but unsure if its working due to stressful enviroment).  
\- Some form of psychotic behavior I think the wording is from psychiatrist.   
\- Self harm OCD problem.  
\- Bipolar.  
\- I feel like her memory is good.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite my horrible short term memory, Ive been drilling in our conversations now. Now that im noticing this miscommunication, its actually getting me worried. Ive talked to my wife about it but shes not worried cause its always trivial decisions. I agree BUT I dont want this to escalate to more serious decisions. Im not sure if my wife is losing it. If I am losing it. Or shes just saying the opposite to be right cause she doesnt want to be wrong. Just out of spite. I dont know. I honestly hope its me, she doesnt deserve any more problems like this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Heres an example..  


\- Tell me wife to get midnight blue hair dye cause it would look good and you can still see the blue.  
\- She says no it wont work. Gets mad, shuts down my ideas. (shes been upset with her hair, bad dye)

\- I give up.  
\- Next day she buys dark purp, looks like midnight blue but purple, looks nice.  
\- ""Looks good! See! Dark colors still show in your hair etc etc."" 

\---Convo switches to what I said about midnight blue--

\- ""You never said midnight blue, you said blue black""

\- Me confused ""what no I said midnight blue, I didnt even know blue black was a color of dye""

\- ""Thats what you said. You didnt say midnight blue. You said blue black.""

\- I just laugh at this point, no way I would have ever said blue black. That dye color isnt even in my vocab.

&amp;#x200B;

If she admitted I said midnight blue, it would become obvious I was right and she was wrong. By saying I said blue-black, I can still be wrong, thus neither of us was right.

&amp;#x200B;

There was another convo just like this a few days ago. I literally had proof of what I said, and she was wrong in what I supposedly said. She never said sorry, never said anything, just kinda got silent. When I ask for an apology, she usually twists it and finds something to counter me with.  


This made me pay attention more.

&amp;#x200B;

Ive been with her for 10 years and Id happily admit im the one being wrong. However I dont think she understands how very unpleasant this is to deal with. Miscommunication ends marriages. I dont want to have to record everything we decide on cam. I should be able to ask my wife if she wants something to eat, and we be clear on the decision.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a type of mental issue? Is any of this familiar? I know I should post this on a relationship reddit but this seems more mental related. I really dont want to accept my wife may be twisting things cause she doesnt want to admit shes wrong. I NEED to believe shes better than that.  


I know people change. Im just scared.",21May2019,2
33,"Hi Everyone,

I made an entirely new account to post this in efforts of staying anonymous. My best friend, who we can call John for privacy, has been struggling with anxiety and depression for years now. However, this year, these struggles have finally seemed to consume him.

John and I had met back in 7th grade and have been friends/acquaintances ever since. We were never really close until July 2018 where we started becoming close. At the end of August 2018 we had a falling out and didn't talk until the end of October 2018. Ever since then, we have become super close and he is my best friend. We are always there for each other, talk on a daily basis, hang out very often, support each other in any way needed, and my friendship with him is extremely important to me.

In January 2018, when me and John were not friends, he had tried weed for the first time. He claims that this had been an amazing experience and I believe this has been a gateway to other drugs. Ever since then, John has reverted to drugs in times of depression. It is very common for him to ask me if he can get high when he is sad or down. I of course tell him to instead talk to me about it instead of just trying to escape reality. He has talked about overdosing on Xanax or other prescription drugs which he has easy access to. I have stopped him multiple times from doing so.

There are times where John is very happy to be alive. For instance, for his 18th birthday, I got him these polaroids of memories we had made together. Shortly after he had expressed how happy he was to be alive despite his previous thoughts of suicide. There are a few other times where he has expressed his happiness to be alive and it really made me feel happy because I thought he had reached a good place in life.

However, in the past few days, John has fallen into some sort of depression. I asked him today what was wrong, he said:

* He believes that he only has three friends (me and two other girls). I know this belief is not true. John is a very social person and he talks to many people. He can easily make conversation with just about anyone and has friends in all his classes. I reiterated to him that many people only have a few close friends who they can trust, and that these three friends are REAL friends which is something many people do not have. I also expressed to him that he has many other friends who may not close, but that he had tricked himself into believing that these aren't actually friends because they aren't close.
* He believes that he does not have anything going for him. This is not true as well. We are seniors in highschool. All of us are about to graduate and go off to college in order to build our futures. There is no reason why John should doubt himself based on where he is now. He has A LOT of time to grow skills and fulfill his potential.
* He believes that he lets people use him. Yes, this is true. A lot of people have taken advantage of John and it has taken a big toll on him. Recently, John realized this girl had been using him. He said through a text, ""how \[could\] someone i was so close too just \[use\] me now"". I told John to stop being friends with this girl and that he had to learn from his experiences to prevent being used in the future. I told him how I was used a lot throughout the years, and that I still am today sometimes, but that I learn from it and not let it happen to myself in the future.

Today, John said, 

&gt;\&gt;i genuinely want to be dead lol   
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;i don’t like being alive   
&gt;  
&gt;\&gt;i try so hard to be happy but every moment of happiness is temporary

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout the entire day, John told me he has been having suicidal thoughts. I am going to go to his house tomorrow to comfort him. However, I am truly scared and concerned for his safety. I want to make him feel better and realize his self worth. I have contacted some of my contacts in the tech industry and have arranged for John to get an internship to make him maybe feel worthy of something. John has a psychologist, but he has not gone to her for a month or so. He currently takes Zolofot, this anti-depressant his psychiatrist prescribed him. This causes him to have mood swings and ""weird moods"" as he calls it.

I wanted to know if anyone else has had a similar experience where their friend was suicidal, and what they did to make them feel better. I am particularly looking for help on how I can make him improve his image of himself, and how I can make John become happy again. Thanks.",21May2019,0
34,"Hey guys, I was hoping I can relate with someone on this (I’ll also try to keep it short and sweet, might be super super long so please bare with me). I’ve been going through the hardest period of my life ever. I’m 19 years old and currently a sophomore in community college. So back in summer of 2018, I had my first ever major panic attack while high on weed. It was the most terrifying thing ever; it felt like I was having a heart attack. From then on, it was basically a mental domino effect. I would say that afterwards, i noticed that I was always anxious about something. What exactly? I have no idea. My body and my mind felt like it was always on edge and I couldn’t get rid of it. It was honestly annoying. This went on for a while and then I went through a tiny phase of minor depression. I just felt down, but not utterly sad. So at this point, I’m starting to notice what else is going on with mentally. Probably the worse decision I ever did throughout this was then google my symptoms, my god that was dumb. But I was new to all this and had no idea what was going on, I just needed answers. So I come to the conclusion that I was possibly going through psychosis of some sort and this freaked me out more than anything. I couldn’t fathom the thought of becoming mentally sick and never be able to form relationship, have fun, etc. What ultimately ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED me that i was becoming schizophrenic/getting psychosis was that I went through a bad case of depersonalization. I’d say this happened 1 month after my panic attack. Not only was I depressed about this, my life felt like it just was just in constant dream state. The best way to describe my case of DP is that everything became super unfamiliar and there was like a dreamy filter through my perspective; it was utterly terrifying. Apparently DP is actually super common amongst anxiety sufferers, so that kind of made me feel better. Yet, I had myself convinced that I was in the middle of getting schizophrenia and that there was no hope for me whatsoever. This obsession turned into being afraid of absolutely anything. Once I googled symptoms of schizophrenia, it was basically game over for me: I constantly checked to hear voices, I made sure to check my surroundings, and I made sure to not believe in typical schizophrenia delusions. What absolutely scared me was that the common delusions that I looked up started to grow on me and made me feel like I wanted to believe them. Stuff like government watching me, cameras in my room, or people trying to hurt me, etc This was an entirely different battle on it’s own and it made me feel absolutely insane. I cried every single night because I thought I was done for. Honestly, I still do at times. As of right now, Im in the battle of these same thoughts and it feels like my false delusions are becoming true in my head and I’m utterly broken and defeated. I can function fine at work and school and can socialize good, but these thoughts break me and drill in my head every time I try to get rid of them or try to desensitize them. I feel like I will never become not scared of these thoughts and they will manifest into total schizophrenia. Every time I think about my future of hanging out with friends, getting a degree, or just relaxing, these schizophrenic thoughts just wash them away like a tidal wave. I feel like my brain is on “lock mode” and it can’t break free of anything and I’m at wits end. I’m scared to take medication but I’m assuming it’s my best bet along with exercise and a good diet. If anyone can relate or help, please let me know. I want to get through this so badly but I’m at the point where I think I’m believing my delusions. Please help!",21May2019,2
35,"Hey y’all,

To make a long story short, I am under a lot of stress right now (in grad school, long distance relationship, working a lot) and have always had bad anxiety. I’ve been pretty depressed this past year but things are getting so bad. I freak out over trivial matters and get paranoid, eventually making a scene and blowing things out of proportion. Sometimes I jump to the worst conclusions and make wild accusations. I’m worried my boyfriend/friends are going to tire of this very soon.

38,"My entire life, I have suffered from depression and anxiety. In recent months the depression has gotten worse, leaving me with suicidal thoughts. In the midst of all of the depression, my boyfriend decided our relationship should go on a break because we would not be able to see each other for three months due to jobs and internships. This was incredibly hard because we went to the same college, slept in the same bed every night, and hung out every night in the same place and have the same friends. While still at school, we continued to be friends and coexisted peacefully. Two weeks after our breakup, I was hysterically crying and upset while drunk, so my best friend wanted me to come over to his dorm. My friend drove me to his place due to me being impaired and said she would be back in an hour because my best friend had to go to work. I went to his place, and we ended up laying on his bed, him comforting me about my breakup. (For context, him, my ex, and I were all best friends). We talked about very deep things, and I ended up drunkenly telling him that I thought about kissing him (he was sober). I then quickly said that I could never, how bad it would be, and kept nervously rambling on. While I negatively rambled, he just came over to me and kissed me. He asked to do other stuff, and I said no. He tried to sway my decision by coercing me, but I then again declined. My other friend came to pick me back up so he could go to work. When coming back to campus, I continued to drink with my other friends. After three hours, my best friend texted me and said he could drive me back to his dorm after work so I was safe. Not having clear judgment, I allowed him to come get me since I was almost blackout and wouldn't be able to walk to my own dorm. I remember getting back to his dorm. I remember being asked to kiss again. I remember declining multiple times. The next morning, I woke up in his shirt and only my underwear. When he woke up, he asked if I wanted to go for round two. Confused, I asked what he was talking about. He told me we had sex. Although I do not remember the act, I panicked, said no again, and asked him to drive me back to my dorm. I remember the drive back, and not knowing what to do, say, or feel. I didn't know what questions to ask or what to do. I tried to act like everything was normal and the entire thing did not happen. I felt so much guilt and the entire thing was eating me alive. A few days passed, and I could not take it anymore. I decided out of respect, I should tell my ex what happened. He was the only person I trusted with terrible situations, and I knew I needed to do something. I had no idea whether or not I was sexually assaulted, or if this was my own fault. My ex only let me get a few sentences in before he angrily stopped me, told me to get all of my things, and blocked me on all social media and my number. I left his room hysterical and went to my other friend's room. This friend proceeded to call my best friend and told him to come over since everyone in our friend group was finding out about this from my ex boyfriend's perspective. My best friend said ""I should not have to rush back for something that isn't my problem"" and did not come back. After pulling myself together, I was able to tell most of my friends my entire story. They were all furious at him, and proceeded to cut him out of their life. I was in denial that my best friend could do something like that to me. I was in denial that I was sexually assaulted. Most of my friends were there helping me weigh legal options and talk me through everything. The entire time, I just had impending guilt on how much I hurt my ex boyfriend that I love, and the fact that I would never be able to tell him the whole story or know if he was okay. That night, my friend slept with me in my dorm making sure I was okay. In the morning, she woke up and said she was going to lunch with a friend but she would be right back. During this time of being alone for the first time since it all happened, all the guilt, shame, and sadness sunk in. I started to feel numb and couldn't live with myself, knowing how much pain I put everyone else in. I decided right then and there, I was going to end my own life. I got in my car, went to target, and bought these beautiful orange tulips and a bottle of NyQuil. When walking to my dorm, I asked for a sign not to do it. A few moments later I saw my ex walking down the sidewalk. Although he never saw me, my entire heart sunk. I went up to my room, put my favorite flowers in a vase, and drank the entire bottle of NyQuil. After about thirty minutes, I couldn't feel a thing. I thought it did not work. My friend texted me saying she got back and wanted to hang out. Since it was not working, I decided to go and act like everything was normal. When I tried to get up, I was a little lightheaded, so I got two of my friends to help me walk over. When I got there, a group of us sat on the couch and watched Netflix for an hour. During this hour, I started to not be able to move, then lost my sight, then lost my ability to think. I decided I could not die on the couch in front of all my friends. When a few left, I panicked and got my closest friend to call for help. I told her what I did, and she and another friend rushed me to the hospital. Turns out, I was an hour away from dying. After recovering, I felt so guilty for almost dying and hurting so many people. What hurts the most, is I have no idea how my ex feels in all of this, what he knows, and what he does not know. I want more than anything to talk to him about it, but I want to respect his space and privacy because I am aware of how badly I hurt him. Although I am blocked, our friend group has a snap chat groupchat that we are both in. I am still very in love with my ex, and want nothing more than to talk about all of this with him. We will not see each other in person until August. Should I talk about it in August? or try to sooner? Or should I just leave him alone completely? We have the same friends so we will see each other frequently. ANY advice on any part of my story would be helpful. I am doing much better mentally as well, for I am in therapy.",21May2019,3
39,"My mood fluctuates from delight and excitement to grizzly, gruesome, and gory depression.

Like from not feeling the top of the world but feeling okay and nice at least all the way down to the feeling like you are waiting for a monster to come out of the closet or through the window in a horror movie or even in real life - I'm 30 years old btw.

Not asking for help or advice cuz I know what to do, I just needed to share.

What I believe I have to do is calm myself and still myself so all the bad feelings can come out but the bad feelings are so painful that I can only take them in short bursts.

Then if I go too long without feeling the bad stuff then I get overly excited and get hyper to the point of losing myself in confusion.",21May2019,2
40,"*posted this on another sub too, sorry if you see this twice*

Ok maybe kinda dramatic but it hasn't been too great

Literally nothing this year has really gone way. The only good thing is that I got a major surgery that improved my quality of life, but that's one of those things that you know is going to happen. I did wait a whole year and paid $2000 so imo it doesnt have as big of an impact as working towards something and getting rewarded.

Speaking of working towards things, I spend the whole year working on my portfolio for college. It's a very competitive program and I put all my time and energy into making the best art I could. I was insanely stressed and half way through that year I had a giant, 4 or more month long depressive episode that i managed to chug through somehow. And yet after all that I didnt get in and actually got an insanely low score. So I have to take a gap year and try again (which was my plan b, I just really believed that I would be able to get in). So now I have to endure another year of being under an ungodly amount of stress, thus demolishing any remaining mental health I have left. Oh and since I didnt get in, i won't be moving away from my parents so I'm stuck living in my dysfunction family that only amplifies my depression. The only positive is that all my pets are there and if I moved I wouldn't be able to take them with me, at least not for first year. Also since all my friends are going to post secondary, I'm stuck in my town all alone. Most of my friends are going places really far and wont be able to visit often. I've found myself suddenly drifting away from my friends so I'm not even sure I'll have any close friends to hang out with anyway. Right now I don't think I have a  actual support system. I had a therapist for a while but when I got out of a depressive episode I stopped going to her and now that I've started another one, I'm too scared to come back to not disappoint her. Plus my parents believe that since I'm not in therapy anymore it must mean I'm fine and i don't want them to know that just because I went to therapy for 6 months then stopped doesnt mean I'm cured. And it's also expensive. My one friend that I could vent to is kinda not talking to me anymore. I have no idea why but now it seems like I lost my closet friendship of my life and got replaced by her boyfriend which makes me feel even more worthless. 

I've just been so depressed. I was able to sleep for 13 hours one night which is a bit worrying. My grades are starting to slip (I'm a 90s/high 80s student too). I can feel myself giving up but no one seems to catch on. According to my psychiatrist who diagnosed me with depression in November, I've had it undiagnosed for 4 years prior and honesly i just dont see it going away. Idk how I'm supposed to keep living and staying motivated if everything is going wrong. The worst is that I cant even talk to anyone outside the internet. I so fucking depressed and I cant handle this.

I'm currently studying systems engineering and while I do not feel like I'm really good at particular engineering topics, such as math or physics (I'd say I'm just average at it), I did fell in love with programming. I am not the best at it, nowhere even close, probably not even close to the skill level someone should have after a couple of years of college-programming experience, but I still like it a lot.

I usually do well in my assignments, I have fun doing them and solving/debugging my own stuff, it gives me a sense of accomplishment like no other things ever do in my life, I suck at tests though, I really can't apply what I learned under pressure, my mind goes blank and I question everything I type, making me lose track of my initial idea because I keep deviating myself with questions such as ""What's your plan B if this doesn't work?"" or ""This was too easy, don't you think? You probably got it wrong"".

Today we had to deliver an assignment for our programming class, we had a week to do it, but due to other stuff happening, such as studying for tests and other homework and being overall tired, I was ""forced"" to do the whole assignment over the weekend. Didn't sleep the entire weekend trying to finish it, and I just couldn't do it, I couldn't even sleep out of frustration and sadness over the fact I felt so powerless and stupid about something I really enjoyed and want to be good at.

Got to class, and apparently everyone else, even people who worked on the assignment only during the weekend as well could solve it, pretty much 80% of the class could do it, but me.

I can't let it go, It's been a few hours but I feel so frustrated and angry at myself, even when I got home and tried to fall asleep, I woke up 1 hour later angrier than before, to the point where rage got the best out of me and I started hitting the pillow over and over. As I type this, I feel as frustrated as before, I want to let go and understand it is just one mistake but it just feels so bad. I feel blocked, powerless, helpless and I feel like if I get stuck this early during my career, what will be of me in a year or two?

TL;DR: Whiny, angry young adult with issues can't forgive himself, now feels stupid, frustrated and blocked because of one assignment and wants to learn how to let go of things like this.",21May2019,1
43,"Hey everyone.
A friend and I recently decided we would start up some kind of ""Mental Health Support Group"" Facebook group for our local area. We live in a semi regional part of Australia and there isn't an active community here of any kind for people suffering from mental illness. 

We both suffer from social inedpitude of some kind (anxiety, personality disorder etc.) so we originally conceived the idea because we thought it would be nice to have a secure place for like minded people to get together.

Anyway, the reason I am posting here is because I need some help with it. I want it to be done perfectly, so that people feel included and safe, and I want to be sure I'm running it well. So, the help I need is:

- Help with a description of the group.
- Help with a sort of ""landing page"" for people. Something that is welcoming and warm.
- A list of rules.
- anything else that might be helpful that I can't think of right now

Due to where I'm at at the moment (mentally speaking), my cognitive abilities are shot rn. That's why I'm asking for help. I just want it to be done right.

48,"My 30 yr old bf doesn’t know what he’s doing with his life (his words). He admits to struggling with anxiety and depression. He hasn’t pursued higher education/university yet because he isn’t sure what he wants to do. And he worries even if he thinks he knows what he wants to do, he might end up not liking it, and thus 4 years of college would be wasted. But he has anxiety because he’s already “old.” He has over-worry and fear of everything in life and the inevitable death of human life stresses him out. He says he still doesn’t know what he wants out of life, considering we are all going to die. All these fears paralyze him. He says he struggles committing to one thing. I’m his first girlfriend (he only had fwb before). He spends a lot of time escaping / procrastinating by playing video games. He does smoke marijuana to calm his brain’s anxieties. He still relies on his parents financially for certain things (although he does live alone).

So not sure what I’m diagnosed with but doctor and psychiatrist or whatever told me sounds like I have PTSD, I’ve had anxiety since I can remember and things that have happened in my life has caused depression and stress which causes depersonalization. 

At first by the doc I got prescribed: 
citalopram 10mg and hydroxyzine 25mg 

Then my dose got upped of 20mg citalopram but still 25mg hydrozyzine and added 0.01 clonodine

“Girly boy girly boy” “what are you a girl” “if you want to be a girl so bad why don’t I call you Delilah instead” “for someone who thinks they’re a boy you sure act like a bratty girl” “you’re 13 and still sound like a girl, what are you a tranny? Are you on estrogen or something you brat?” The repetition and your tone of voice made you sound like a 9 year old. Every time you’re angry you always go back to the same thing. You always go back to calling me a girl. Can you not think of anything new?
 
You were so proud of yourself and how you treated me. When we went to the record shop the man at the counter asked what we were looking for. I thought you weren’t mad at me anymore until you said “me and my daughter are just looking around” I froze when you said that. I was stuck between sobbing and yelling at you. But at the time my hair was down to my jaw and my voice was still pre pubescent. No one would believe me if I tried to fight back. Would they laugh?

When I was 11 I was 5’, had long wavy hair, a high voice, and I didn’t dress particularly masculine since most of the time I was in a school uniform of some sort. We couldn’t afford to buy new uniforms and my shorts were above my knees when they should have been below and my shirt was loose. I had a BMI of 14 so my legs and arms were effeminate, which fucking sucked because since it’s so god awfully hot here were usually showing. The only thing that would show that I wasn’t a girl was my face and name. Most people were either confused about my gender or knew I was a male, but when I met people and was with you they would all refer to me as a she. You told them my name was Dallas but since you kept calling me a she they all believed you. Even my grandma who knows I was born male calls me a female.

My mom told me that when you got mad at me you started telling my mom I was trans and that I was a girl. You weren’t satisfied with screaming at me in the car. You had to email her saying I was a “sissy boy” and start calling me a brat and plenty other things through text messages. When I blocked your number I got guilt tripped by both you and my mom to unblock you, which you just used to make me feel even more guilty.

Whenever you get mad you take all your anger out on me. It doesn’t matter what got you angry you will scream at me and then make me apologize. You’ll scream anything and everything you can in order to make me scared and then you’ll act like you’re the one whose hurt to make me feel bad for you. You say “if you don’t apologize I’ll never visit you again” which is childish to say the least but then every fucking day after that you’ll send “😭😢” which is SO FUCKING STUPID to the point where I’ll apologize just to get you to shut up. And then you’ll scream at me again. What did I do wrong?",21May2019,13

For starters, I'll give a brief bit about the stuff I do know.
I have mild depression, but no anxiety. I'm generally okay, sometimes I have the feeling of not wanting to exist but I have never wanted to really die or anything like that. I've had a pretty easy life so far, I'm 21 and doing alright. 

What I need help with is something I don't have control over. 
If I'm stressed, or making/doing something which then fails, I can suddenly become quite angry where I try to hold back tears. 
I tend to have a bit of destructive behavior when this happens, either breaking something small nearby, punching a solid thing or sometimes I find myself scratching the top of my hands. 
This angry or stressed state can very rarely come out of nowhere as well, but I feel that might have to do with the depression side of things.

I don't know why this happens and don't know how to prevent it from occuring?
I've tried relaxing myself when the anger/stress comes but that only really settles in after I've been already been destructive.

I’m going down again. Summer always hit hard for so many reasons but now I have about 30 more things to add. 


My primary physician is trying to send me to a psychiatrist but my mother (insurance holder) won’t allow me. I (a minor) can’t get the help I need and the random people i meet on the internet can only help me for so long. i need professional help and the one person who can do that for me is blocking any chance of recovery i have. 

everything i mention below is self diagnosed mostly because i’ve been dealing with it for long and have no access to professional help. please don’t judge me for this because i literally have no other choice. 

i’ve had depression for 4 years.

seasonal depression for the past 2.

anxiety for most of my life

and now everything is just mushing all together and i’m having dissociative problems for the past 1-2 months.  

every summer i reach rock bottom and can barely make it back up. last year i got myself out of the hole by just sheer luck. i don’t think i can do it this year because of all the added problems i’m having.

not to go into too much detail, my mother (as stated above) is not giving me access to professional help, while also telling me i’m making all of this up for attention. i’ve missed so much school because i try to sleep the day away to avoid actually living. on days i don’t go to school i am averaging 15-20 hours of sleep a day and that is if you’re lucky. i missed all my finals and the re-takes are this week but i can’t get out of bed. i’m sleeping through the day so when my friends try to call and text me because they are suicidal and need help right-fucking-now i can’t help them. (happened today, don’t think i can go to school tomorrow to check on them and idk what to do.)

i’ve never really considered suicide until this past 2 months. it’s been in the back of my head every waking moment and even in my dreams. i know it isn’t the answer and will create more problems then it will solve, but i’m done with all of this bullshit. im done with 6 teachers telling me they’re disappointed in me for letting my grades drop. i’m done with my mom telling me that i’m a liar and that i don’t need help. i’m done with my family struggling to buy food for 3 people and barely making enough to live pay check to pay check. 

i’m fucking 13 years old and i have to deal with this shit and i don’t even know how to function anymore. say all you want about age but at this point i’m done fighting everyone on why i’m allowed to have mental health issues at a young age. 

i grew up a lot faster and matured emotionally at a lot younger age than i was “supposed to” i guess. most kids my age are looking forward to their next vacation and i’m looking forward to my 14th birthday so i can get a job and help my mom out.

i’m not even able to feel anything anymore i’ve gotten so numb i forgot what it is like to laugh at a joke or cry about a movie or even just enjoy a moment

I'm hoping that I-- you know.. can maybe not be hit again. I can't tell my parents. I can't tell my parents anything. I never had, or will. I don't think they would even take it seriously. When confronting my brother, he- said it's sibling rivalry but I'm not sure being choked is sibling rivalry. He's violent, I'm violent back, maybe it's fair then. It's kinda just self defense, though.. I just can't take being near him with this fear I have anymore. He has anger issues, maybe he doesn't really mean to hurt me, I can't ruin his future right? Even if it kills me? I don't know. Please give me advice, what to do. Please.",21May2019,1

64,"Trying to be social and meet new people stresses me out so much I'm not sure I'll ever be able to get new friends.

I have avoidant personality disorder and have been pretty much friendless since I became a teenager. I'm now 26.

The other day I felt ready to put myself out there and challenge myself to download a friend-app and try to get in contact with some new people.

I found a couple of people and added them to a group chat. I also started writing with one other person outside the chat.

All of the people seem really nice and friendly. 

The thing is I still feel horribly stressed out chatting with them. I feel really uncomfortable and like I've lost all my sense of safety in my life. I feel uneasy and scared all day long. When I wake up and remember I now have people who wants to speak to me I feel physically unwell. It's like I have a responsibility.

I even agreed to meet up with one of them in ""the heat of the moment"" when I felt slightly confident, and now I just feel tormented and overwhelmed. I don't want to let that person down by canceling last moment. 

I really thought I wanted friends and could handle a friendly relationship, but this is agony for me mentally and physically, and all I'm doing is just having a casual text chat with these people. 

Today I have felt really down and almost slightly depressed because of it all. I feel really bad about myself and suddenly everything looks dark. 

It might sound like I'm overreacting, but I'm really not. I don't want to commit to any relationship because I'm terrified it'll put me in many more and even worse situations than this one. If I dive in to this too deep and make them think I am more capable then I am and then I suddenly don't want to talk or meet anymore then it has gone too far. 

I feel like I just might not ever be ready for a normal friendship. I've grown way too accustomed in my small, safe bubble. It feels like I don't even actually want a relationship with anyone.",21May2019,7
65," 

I just found this subreddit, I hope someone can help, but I feel like no one really cares either. This was also originally posted in [r/nosleep](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep). I have no idea why I'm going to write this, since no one really cares. I also don't know where to start, so I think I'll start at the beginning.

I have always felt a presence in my house, and saw something at my bed watching me sleep when I was about three. It has always been good, comforting if you will. My parents and I think it's my great grandmother. We can sometimes see a shadow floating across the floor, forming a routine that my great grandmother had to the exact little movement. We have always thought that she had good intentions, to protect the great grandchildren she never got to meet when she was alive.

However, lately I have begun to feel down, anxious, shy and just generally sad. This was such a sudden change, like a snap. I have little to no motivation to do homework, hang out with friends, study, work out or even eat. I have alwys had a bit of a sweet-tooth. I used to LOVE sweets and could eat them for hours on end. Now, I start to feel nauseous after one tiny bite. This also happened very suddenly. I have heard of people doing this, but not this fast. I slowly started slipping into depression. I have always had issues with my appearance and weight, but it went from small insecurities to feeling sick when I look in the mirror. I couldn't take off my top without feeling like I have to vomit (this isn't always, just sometimes). Depression faded into suicidal thoughts, and then self harm. I started with scratching myself with the tip of an exacto knife. It then became straight up cutting. I actually feared the other depressed and self-harming people wouldn't accept me, straight up call me an attention-seeker, because I didn't directly cut, just scratch. I got as far as standing on the edge of a cliff, ready to jump (this happened 2 times as of now). I obiously didn't, as I'm writing this.

I have started to lose things, small things, but I can't find them at all and some things have been missing for months. It feels like someone is messing with me, mentally torturing me. I am a control-freak, so not knowing where stuff is, is agony for me. I also can't take being yelled at (which is bound to happen when I lose things), I say sorry for everything, and I mean everything. If you ask me to use a different colour in my drawing, I say sorry. Stuff that doesn't matter at all. Being yelled at makes me feel like a disappointement, a mistake, good for nothing, like I can't do anything right. It frightens me. I hate it.

Now, back to the ghost thing. I feel as if I've disappointed my great grandmother. It feels like I am being punished. Pushed into insanity. Pushed over the edge. Like I am only awaiting my unavoidable early demise. Like I have no purpose. Nothing to live for.

I am expecting people to just say that I'm attention-seeking, just being emo. That I am pathetic for posting this. That everyone goes through this. In other words, I am expecting people to only have negative reactions to this.

I have also started to have tics (small actions such as twitching or repeating), this is very weird as I'm in nearly perfect health, and have never had tics before. Maybe I'm starting to go insane, or have started developing some mental disorder. I have dips in energy and such, maybe it's just stress? Is this normal? I can't talk to anyone about this in fear of looking insane.

Now to the boring disclaimer; english is not my first language. I am sorry for boring you with my useless life.",21May2019,1
66,"I had not a great childhood, psychical (non sexual, sorry I feel like that’s an appropriate thing to say for people to gage the type of abuse my mother, my 2 siblings and I suffered for over 15 years) and emotional abuse from my Father, watching him severely abuse my mother while I was growing up with 2 other siblings. They eventually divorced and my father was sectioned un willingly. I only in the last year of his life repaired the relationship with my father as I was getting out of those asshole teenager stage.  That’s a brief example of my past. Then suddenly 3 years ago when I was 18 I found my dad dead. Had to confirm his body.

70,"Hey guys I just found this sub and I genuinely don’t know what’s up with me atm. I’ve been having consistent, obsessive intrusive thoughts since I was very little. I used to have to repeatedly wash my hands because I felt as though anytime I touched something I was suddenly crawling with bacteria, refusing to sit on the carpet because I thought something would happen to me and other things. As I grew up, these behaviours have changed, like having to “knock on wood” because otherwise something might happen to me or friends or using a specific pen otherwise I will flunk my exams, having my volume set to a specific setting, doing stuff until it *feels* right, etc. My parents never cared enough to get me checked because they thought I was a hypochondriac and would always tell me as such. 

I have been so much stress as of late with home and school. These thoughts and need to fix things or have things a specific way have been really getting to me recently and have been taking a hold of me mentally. I don’t know if I’m just paranoid or superstitious or if it’s normal. I’m in a bit of a pickle. I just don’t know if I’m alone in this and don’t want to sound crazy in telling people. 

It’s not always bad, it comes in waves sometimes. I just really appreciate a bit of a hand atm because it is stressing me out. I cant convince my parents to go to a psychologist because the last time I asked my mum she bawled me out and um it was not the best time for me for a while.

71,"I always thought it was just like hyperactivity in kids but I saw a post on Instagram about it that I read and really related to. After that I've done some research and I know those quizzes and that aren't really accurate or anything but I feel like it would explain so much. I'm really bad with procrastinating even when it's causing me massive stress because I know how important something is and I'm really motivated to do well. I start things constantly with so much energy then end up just dropping off. I feel like I'm constantly just about managing to get things done and I constantly have to fudge things and work at weird times just to finish and end up with something I know I could have done better. Exams especially I put off revising and cram last minute ending up with sometimes the grade I want but sometimes one I know I could have done better than but I make everyone around me think I've been working for weeks and then I feel lazy and like an idiot for not starting earlier. It's become a joke between my friends that I literally can't say no to any opportunity or new thing to sign up to, like if you want someone to do something with you ask me, but it's not that I can't say no I just genuinely want to do all these things and then it's only later when I'm completely overwhelmed I realised I signed up for too much. I'm forgetful and lose things like my phone my keys my bag all the time even though I'm generally quite a responsible person. I can't sit still in lessons, my pens always end up broken because I fiddle with them till they break and I frequently annoy people by shaking my leg or clicking my pen but I struggle not to. I'm dominating in conversations and don't even notice sometimes when I'm getting shouty and talking over people. I go down rabbit holes all the time looking into things that are completely irrelevant to my life and out of line with things I've ever been interested in before but it will be 3am and I'll be looking at the Wikipedia page for the 8th cousin twice removed of some Roman emperor or something. I can't watch a film all the way through and my Netflix recents is just lists of unfinished series because I can't watch anything unless it's something I don't need to pay full attention to. Most of this is probably completely irrelevant and I'm also half convinced that I'm just tricking myself into thinking I have this as an excuse for being lazy and unorganised which is why I don't really know what to do because I also feel like surely if I did it would have been picked up on by now.

tldr; Asian household, in Canada, grandparents came to Canada to help my mom recover from BPD, but want to leave early because of differences with dad. Mom is still in hospital, what do I do? 

My mother (53F) has recently been hospitalized and is slowly but surely recovering from a depressive episode of BPD. It’s been about a week or two since she’s been admitted to the mental health ward, and a month since my grandparents came. 

A couple days ago, my grandparents told me that since they feel like they can’t help out much while my mom’s in the hospital, my grandfather’s heart condition, and the fact that I (21F) am home for the next three months and could help take care of her, they are thinking of leaving to go back to China early. 

Although they say that they’ll leave only once they get the “okay” from my mom, they’ve already packed their bags and have mentioned leaving in a couple days. Keep in mind they haven’t seen their daughter since she got admitted to the mental health ward at the hospital. 

Last night, my dad came home and he and my grandfather got into an altercation, where my grandfather claimed that my dad was being disrespectful to him and not taking care of my mom well enough, the same sentiment was voiced by my dad towards my mother. 

As sort of the “fixer upper” of the family, I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if my grandparents leaving early will be detrimental to my mom when she is out of the hospital, but I also don’t know if I should be asking them to stay given that their mental and physical health seems to be deteriorating and clearly seem very prepared to leave and may have continued conflict with my dad. 

Also, does anyone have any advice when it comes to supporting a family member with BPD? Especially in transitioning out from hospital care and into day-to-day life?

77,"Hi Reddit,
I might be writing this to the wrong subreddit so pardon me if that's the case, I just somehow wanted to tell this to someone.

I'm a constantly happy guy in general. I'm Czech, but went to Germany when I was 12 and was always fairly popular. When I was 12 I had to give up everything to go and study in Germany, my friends, my family, my hobbies.. I only saw them here and there on some weekends. Didn't matter to me at all, was hard as a stone. Now I'm 18, just started on a university, have a 3year relationship, am fairly well off financially and have many new cool friends in Frankfurt where I had moved to. Everything was somewhat fine, but lately I started to feel like I don't belong.. Anywhere. I've got a job (it's a half-university half-job kind of deal) and I don't really like it, I'm going to try to change the department I work in because maybe it's because of that. My German friends are fine and super kind to me, but I still somehow don't belong, my czech friends and I have drifted apart since our lifestyle is so much different. I started to dislike both languages due to the ideas I project onto them, Czech being the language and state where I started and that I've moved away from, so it kind of seems like a ""stupid"" language, i kind of see czech people very similar way. German is interconnected with the work I don't like that much and the fact that I might not know it well enough yet, not knowing certain words when they come up in smalltalk and allinall differing from Germans as well. English is the language I grew up with, in terms of videogames, entertainment and lately even literature (from authors like Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson and Warren Buffet to name a few). I feel that the American(somewhat free, hard working, evolving kind of) mentality fits me way better than the German (where everything has to be super orderly) or czech (that's just kind of lazy and not dreamy enough I guess). I was even thinking about moving there after university. I could take it, I don't mind moving, but I don't know if I want to leave everything behind once more, when I have everything a guy would want here: a functioning relationship, a well-paid scalable job, family, friends... It just... Doesn't seem to be enough... And it's certainly a hard decision for an 18yo 😅... And truth is maybe I'm idealizing America a bit, it's obviously not like in the movies and series and such but... I'm pretty sure the mentality is there...I don't really know what I should do, as said, I'm not miserable but I sure as hell am not as happy as I used to be.
The whole situation is kind of like colorblindness (which I have, eyyyy), I'd say, where it didn't bug me until I found out I have it, I always thought I'll somehow just... Truly fit in and be happy with what I have or not... But as well as being colorblind, it might not work that way and, contrary to colorblindness, there might be a cure for my problem. Then again, maybe it's like a flu or sth, and I'll be a happy fella in a month or two yet again. The stupidest thing to do in that case would be to mindlessly move somewhere else and give up everything I have.
Maybe I'm just dramatizing all of it...i really don't know... But I just thought that I had to tell it to someone who's not immediately going to make a huge deal out of it or won't be bias in his opinion (eg my gf and such)",21May2019,1

Woke up in ER on Sunday, got sent to the psychiatric hospital today and now i'm just doing whatever I'd be doing outside, but in a hospital. Not gonna get xanax anymore tho so the odds i'll try that again are pretty low but i'm working on something. 

After a xanax over dose they gave me a shitload of rivotril to calm me down. Makes sense, right?

The only thing that keeps me ok is that whenever they let me out of here i know for sure i'm not scared of death and i will try to do it again. Once you get there there's no real coming back. 
 
That warm feeling of serenity. It was the only good thing i had left and they took it away from me. But i can't wait to get it back. 

Please don't start telling me that life is worth it, ""pm me if you need to talk"", ""i care about you"". Save those for people that might really need them. I'm just very tired and very done with this shit people call life. I don't want it. I'm not someone unluckily that  had the worse life ever and could potentially turn it over and restart from scratches.

83,"So I've been with a service that does a sort of guided form of CBT that's pretty hands off. I forget the exact term my therapist used to describe it. It's closer to working through a book yourself than what I imagined therapy to be.

Today was my last session with them and while I feel I've learned some useful skills, I'm not exactly much better over all. Without me bringing further treatment up, she said they may be able to put me onto another program that's a tier above this one. She didn't explain much of what that means, but I gather it involves going into greater depth with the cycle and my issues.

They have limited funding so there might not be a space for me, and I might not qualify for it, but even if I do I'm hesitant.

One of my biggest fears with all of this is that there's nothing wrong with me and I'm just a lazy sack of shit who does nothing.

86,"I'm looking for some coping mechanism or something to help me get by? I'm already on 100mg sertraline, I've been to therapy for PTSD and I have a counsellor appointment this Thursday 

My introduction to kissing was 2 boys that used to bully me, that ended with one of them getting their penis out and I ran away. I think I was around 12

My second experience (?) I had a group of guy frjends, we were best mates but it was constantly a matter of being passed around between the both of them, being touched up etc. (Age 13/14)

I must admit I don't class the above as sexual assaults whatsoever I fully consented I was just immature and naive. 

My first sexual experience I was took advantage of, we lived in a country where clubbing underage was pretty commonplace and most 15/16  year olds would go out. I was in a group of friends but eventually lost them, two lovely lads carried me home as I was insanely drunk and dropped me off with my group of friends. That night one of the boys from the group snook into bed with me, I was so drunk I didn't know what was happening and ended up giving him oral sex before passing out. Later that week I found out he had filmed it without my consent and shared it among mutual friends. 

Between this and the two pivotal sexual assaults that I attribute my PTSD too I had some relationships but they were unusually unhealthy and a lot of the time I was just a past time for boys. I rarely reached girlfriend status and when I did it didn't last.

The first one age 17 I was visiting a friend in Spain, once again underage drinking wasn't particularly frowned upon and we hit up a bar, a guy started flirting with me - I tried to get away to the bathroom but he followed me and forced me to give him oral sex.

The second I was 18, I had met a guy at a party and he looked after me alongside some friends, he seemed really nice and I went to visit him. We hung out with his friends and it seemed sweet. Unfortunately I left my phone back at his house and had to get it. I kept asking when the bus was and he lied and said they came far later than they did so I was forced to stay there. I saw the relationship as totally platonic but he propositioned me, I kept saying no, making up excuses but after two hours of constant begging me to have sex he said ""I don't want to force you but.."" by this point I'd missed the bus and my family was too poor to pay for a taxi. As soon as he said ""I don't want to force you but.."" I knew I had to do it I didn't want to be another statistic if I consented it was okay (Plot twist: I got PTSD regardless) 

I'm 21 years old now and I can't move past it. I can distract flashbacks I can ground myself but it always comes up. I can't have healthy relationships because I end up crying a lot more than one should. I feel like all my experiences have lead me to be this broken shell of a woman, I can't even have sex without feeling like damaged goods.

Can anyone offer some help/insight? Maybe you've been through something similar. I'm looking forward to my counselling appointment but I've not had great experiences with my countries national health service as it's chronically underfunded.",21May2019,2
87,"So my sister is the smartest one in my family. She works in Hospice care for the State. She goes to people's houses who are dying and sets up a care plan. Well, she is aware of my mental health status. But, today I put all my cards out on the table. I told her I was having suicidal thoughts and how hopeless I have been. I thought she would be more concerned and the reaction I got was not what I expected. She didn't seem she was that worried about it from my conversation. I was hoping she would know someone from her field of work that could help me. I do see a therapist but she isn't that helpful. I am in a rut here and it seems I get more help from people on reddit. Maybe I just blindsided my sister and at that point in time she didn't know how to react?",21May2019,9
88," 

I've had a pretty hellish life, sure, I've found brief moments of joy, even inner peace, but underlying all of this is a pure form of suffering, and I never found a name for my condition.

When I was 7, my Dad passed away from motor neurone disease, this isn't exactly the sad part - well, before he passed away, my Mother, spent effectively 99% of her time looking after him, meaning that while I was growing up, during my prime developmental years, I received practically zero attention growing up.

Life as a child was difficult, but in a way manageable, since I had no reference for how severe my issues really were - I grew up with no connection to my family at all, I had extremely difficult verbal issues with communicating with my family members, often I would making humming noises or just generally retarded sounds instead of vocalising my words, I can't look my mother, or anyone in my family in the eye.

\- meanwhile, the rest of my brain was entirely functional - most of the time, the good thing about being mentally slow is that you don't know you're mentally slow, making it manageable - but here I am, suffering in a very real hell, knowing exactly how bad my issues are.

I'm 19 years old now, the most I can say to my mother is 'How are you' or 'How was work' in a very monotone, slow voice. I genuinely have never had a single moment in my life where I haven't felt somewhat on edge - I essentially don't have a family, I'm the single and only person I know with this problem.

The interesting thing is, aside from occasional suicidal anxiety, I'm relatively normal around friends and some strangers - I can hold a conversation with them (although im always on edge) and can verbalise feelings and express myself.

I need to find closure - 19 years, not a single name for my condition, no way of fixing it, and there's no way I'll ever find a psychologist skilled enough to fix this. 

Thank you for listening.",21May2019,2

The first episode, Adderall, discusses the delicate subjects of depression, anxiety, addiction and the all the fears of growing up. Trying to understand why so many of us feel jaded and disillusioned very early in life.

Hopefully this episode will serve as an inspiration to move this conversation forward, and to deal with this important issue with the focus and urgency it deserves.

I literally had a previous dr there tell me that my aruging and looping for 8+ hours with no sleep was normal. Anyways I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder.

Not thats its horrible i just thought what i was going through was rough so it makes me feel like im delusional. Can I get some advice on what bipolar actually is and just general advice?

100,"It’s always there and it’s so LOUD. He talks over my thinking voice and overpowers any time he wants to talk. Sometimes he will say some really really really dark stuff.

101,"Hi, I’m 23 year old, female and working as a software engineer as of a year ago at a relatively small office in a medium-sized tech company. 

Over the past few months I’ve been getting more and more uncomfortable with my job. It’s gotten to the point where I’m literally panicking in the morning, dreading workdays and feeling drained just thinking how I’d handle that situation or the other.
To give you some background, a couple of months ago we had a change in management. Now, a previous older coworker is now my manager. While he’s a social butterfly, once you get to know him you see that he’s very passive aggressive and comes from a cultural background that allows him to make sexist and racist jokes and he basically has no filter in other areas of conversation or behaviour either. 

He interferes in my personal life, and while we have a fully flexible Work From Home program, he gets interrogative, dismissive and cold if I use it (I’m talking, once maybe twice a week max). I always have to keep my guard up around him, prepared to defend an action that’s perfectly acceptable by the company, like choosing to work from home for no specific reason I’d like to divulge, when no other team gets that sort of questioning. He thinks he knows everything and has this controlling, micromanaging nature. If it isn’t done his way, it isn’t done right. It is almost like he has already formed an idea of who I am in his head and will go out of his way to confirm it when I do something that isn’t completely in line with what he wants. I go above and beyond, trying to seek his approval, which never happens. But I’m always afraid, that he’s right and I’m in the wrong since that it has come to the point where I’m terrified of making any simple decision, fearing his reaction. And he picks up on that. So I end up feeling like shit, whether if I do it my way or his.

Don’t get me wrong, he’s pretty good at his job, is generally nice and a great teacher but overall he’s obnoxious, critical and this demand for authority over me is freaking me out. I do have a tendency to be a people-pleaser especially around authority. I freeze and can’t think, fear overtakes me and I doubt every decision I make. I’m becoming this weak, intimidated person (hardly who I am) and I have to overthink every little action I make. 
During our one on ones, he points out everything that I can work on, which I appreciate as I want to improve but he does it in a condescending way. He frequently compares me to my coworker, who is just as qualified as I am.  If I tell him I need to work on my time-management for example, he’d bring it up frequently in other irrelevant areas of conversation, using it against me. I end up being so vulnerable rather than supported. I can’t balance between honesty for career growth and shielding myself from his tactics and power plays.

How do I deal with this? I really want to do well at my job, have no drama and just do what’s acceptable by the company without fearing repercussions from this manager. I’ve never been this affected by authority.",21May2019,4

This is about something that everyone whos dealing with mental health has heard said to them before but chosen to ignore or not believe ""it wasn't your fault"" 

For years i've moulded my personality an characteristics around experiences that happen to me in the most vulnerable stages of my life when i felt the most out of control an alone, this was always my narative going into any relationship or experience cause i thought that was who i was. (worthless, unloveable an alone) 

But i finally realise today after it being said a thousand times to me ""it wasn't my fault, it wasn't a reflection on who i was or who i would be come it was more of a reflection on them that caused me this pain"" 

Although i'm far from feeling happy in my life an in control of where i'm going but i feel comfortable i'm at the right starting point.

107,"Hello, I understand that stress is normal and feeling sad is normal but I don't know whether my thoughts of suicide are normal or not. I haven't been to a therapist because I want to avoid medical costs so right now I'm just assuming I'm neurotypical and don't have a mental illness. I also haven't talked to a therapist because I know I can't mention my thoughts of suicide so I see no point in attending. My mom has been diagnosed with depression (but has left is untreated) and my sister has been diagnosed with social anxiety.   


Regardless I am very stressed. I take some sort of medication every night to sleep because I will stay awake worrying if I don't. I wake up at 3 AM almost every night with an inability to stop thinking. Some nights I can't fall back asleep because I'm so stressed. But my life is fairly fine. I attend college and have a job but I feel constantly stressed. I worry about my grades (which is normal) but I worry about everything else too. I can't stop thinking about the future of the planet and the approaching effects of climate change. Whether I will make enough after college to retire.  How dumb I am in comparison to other students, student loan debt, My parent's failing marriage, My family's finances and lack of savings, etc, etc. I worry about everything that could possibly go wrong. But regardless I achieve things which makes my worrying seem necessary.  
   
And I feel abnormal when I look at my friends' lives they seem so...easy. They all have parents that can pay for their tuition outright so they have no student debt. Their parents give them credit cards so they can afford things. They don't study but get better grades. I feel so pathetic. I spend so much time applying to and maintaining my scholarships (and working while trying to balance school) and yet they're all doing better than me. I played it safe in every aspect of my life (i went for the budget option academically instead of going to a dream school, picked a major that has good income potential, I decided not to live in dorms to save money which hindered my ability to make friends, etc). I'm always struggling to stay afloat but yet they're all outpacing me. 

&amp;#x200B;

What makes me have thoughts of suicide is the understanding that life is always going to be like this. Sure I'll graduate college but then I have grad school. After grad school, I have debt to tackle and a career to establish. I don't want to be alone for the rest of my life but every married person I know seems miserable so I'm screwed either way. The planet is never going to be saved and I can't bring children into a world with a dying planet so now I'm alone again. I know that life is always going to be this stressful and miserable so it all seems pointless and I just want it to end sometimes. I just feel so incredibly tired and my life has barely begun. I constantly think about what would happen if I jumped off a building or walked into traffic. But the financial burden that my death or hospitalization would cause my parents prevents me from doing it. I also have fun with my friends sometimes but those times feel so minuscule compared to how often I feel stressed. I just don't want to live if things are always going to be like this. I'm so tired of working hard for the bare minimum.   


tl;dr life is hard and I'm tired of being tired. Are thoughts of suicide related to stress normal?",21May2019,1
108,"Ok this started when I got into a relationship , we are Indians - so I was brought up in such a way that sex is a taboo and shit ..still I'm open minded in most of the stuffs except when it comes to 'my partner' if she had sex with many . I know that's not wrong but I get insecure - maybe it is because I never did sleep with anyone. My girl she has slept with about 5 men(in relationship) - no sex just the other activities. I fell in love - yes I did feel insecure but u could just say when u are in love , you actually don't care about that . 

So , basically she was jobless when we started this relationship , coz of which she was depressed and sad with her life and all the tough situations it was putting her into . I prioritized her, would always be available no matter what and gave her constant positivity and motivation . Ok , I was in Dubai and she was in India - so it was over WhatsApp and calls . After 6 months , i met her finally but it was for just 10 days ....but beautiful 10 days . She told me how much she loved me more than anyone she ever had and thanked me so much for getting her out of this crippled depression that she had ,also said - ' I am smiling and enjoying life and that's all because of you '.

She got a great job, so many friends and started going out a lot , classes like badminton, swimming and dance classes . She didn't have time to talk to me , we would only talk once a week and that too for max 15-20 minutes. The romantic talk, or sharing a lot with each other was lacking as she was busy.

I felt really disappointed , coz no matter what situation I was in - I was always there for her...if I went out with my friends - I would still text her and stuff. 

I thought I was being immature , so she asked for space- I became silent , yes I had sleepless nights but I loved her and wanted to respect her space even if it meant of just talking few minutes in a week.... Yesterday she called me up and said she was going to Paris - I was like 'Wow that's amazing  ,with whom?! . She mentioned that's she is going with this guy who is a good friend of hers ( this guy was her crush whom she slept with a year back ) ...I got all insecure and sad - and tried to explain this to her but she lashed back saying I don't have an open mind and I don't trust her which is why I'm feeling uncomfortable about this . I cut the call , but she texted me back this -' Look I love you so much and always will , he is my good friend and it's my dream to go to Paris and I can't miss this opportunity ,so pls trust me on this '

My best mate/ex/roommate and I were out at a bar and she asked the bartender if she could change the music. He directed her to computer on the other end of the bar. So we both go to put on some tunes, after 5 minutes I tell her I’m gonna go finish my beer, thinking she would come back when she finished. Twenty minutes go by and I look up and she’s laughing at the end of the bar with the bartender. 

Well this spiraled in such an unnecessary way. I told her it was a courtesy thing, even if we didn’t have these emotional ties I wouldn’t just leave one friend at the bar to chat it up with a stranger. At the very least, I would express to my friend or the stranger the convo won’t be long. It turned into an entire argument. She told me I could have communicated better and expressed I wanted her to come back. My view, if she wanted to come back she would have but she’s trying to tell me she has no idea what I wanted.

She mentioned that's she is going with this guy who is a good friend of hers ( this guy was her crush whom she slept with a year back ) ...I got all insecure and sad - and tried to explain this to her but she lashed back saying I don't have an open mind and I don't trust her which is why I'm feeling uncomfortable about this . I cut the call , but she texted me back this -' Look I love you so much and always will , he is my good friend and it's my dream to go to Paris and I can't miss this opportunity ,so pls trust me on this '

114,"Trigger Warning: Suicide

&amp;#x200B;

As long as I can remember, I’ve had this view of the world. That nothing had a purpose, nothing mattered. The human race was a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena, and what happened on this planet has little to no significance. That’s how I felt, **insignificant.**

Now, looking back on how much I’ve changed in just this past month, I realize that it is exactly that, our small stage, that makes **us, me**, **you** so significant. I believe that, while purpose may not be abundantly present, somehow, something is driving us in our own play, like a puppeteer, pulling strings. The interactions we have on a daily basis, the conversations we have with friends, the memories we form and share, they all have a slight impact on each others lives, and it is that series of small, seemingly insignificant, pushes that we give and take, that ultimately lead us to where we are meant to be.

As I was contemplating whether or not I should kill myself, with a weapon I intended to use as a concealed carry, I looked up at my ceiling, and I thought. “If there is something out there, give me one good reason why I shouldn’t do this.” A few moments later, I looked back down at that weapon, and something subtly caught my attention, I leaned in closer to read a small etching of randomly assorted letters and numbers that form the serial number. ***“BHPY772” -&gt; “B***e**H**ap**PY772″** I looked back up at the ceiling in shock, laughed to myself, and thought, “Okay, that’s a bit creepy.” Before getting up and walking off, back to whatever it was I was doing at the time to escape my depression.

A few days later, I picked that gun up, and stuck it to my head, pulling the trigger without a round in the chamber, as if to acclimate myself to the feeling. As I went to rack the slide back, and end my life, I closed my eyes. That’s when I saw it. My father, pushing me down the street on my training bicycle, at our first home. I was maybe four or five at the time. A small, insignificant memory, from my early childhood. That one moment, which lasted no more than 30 seconds, had just saved my life. That was my one good reason, and that’s why I put the gun down, and called my mother, confessing to her my suicidal ideations.

Now, I’m a very analytical person, I think about a lot of things, very deeply, and I do a lot of meta-cognition. Which is the practice of thinking about the way you are thinking and the things you think about to draw a sense of self. My experience in in-patient care at the adult flex unit at Dubois Penn Highlands Behavioral Health awakened me. As I went through in-patient care, and I thought about how many odds were stacked against me in getting to where I was now, I realized that they were very slim, the sheer chances of everything happening as it did, were near impossible. The Doctors, the Nurses, the Therapists, they were exactly what I needed to get better.

Now, one could say, “Well, that’s just your survival instincts kicking in, trying to keep you from becoming suicidal again.” To counter that point, I’d like to leave you with a small statistical oddity. The chances of anyone being born, given their ancestors meeting, is about the same odds as four million people meeting in one place at one time, all of them flipping a coin, and every single one of them landing on heads. When I think about the chances of every single one of the Doctors, Nurses, and Therapists being born, and them being in that place at that time with the experience they had to help me, it makes me feel as if our lives are not so meaningless or insignificant after all. Every single moment, thought, and memory we have pushes us down our path to where we are now, where we will be, who we will meet, and how we will effect them. In other words, I won the biggest lottery in the Universe, and I continue to do so each day, and each fleeting moment: **Because I am alive**.

No matter who you are, reading this, where you are, your beliefs, your values- know this: that you are significant, you do matter, and you do belong in this world.",21May2019,5

117,"I spent a fair amount of time in counseling several years ago, during a very difficult and extremely tumultuous time in my life. I learned a lot, and the things I learned there have helped me a lot since then. Unfortunately, I was laid off from my job so I had to stop attending. 


I've been employed now, with a new company, for three years. In the last year or so my anxiety and depression have been becoming more and more difficult to manage. I began looking into the cost of individual counseling, because I think I've reached the point where I kind of need it again. 


I've called several places, and the prices I heard ranged from $95 to $175 for ""about an hour"". Unfortunately for me, my employer only offers high deductible health insurance plans, with HSA contributions to compensate. Well, as an individual in the US, the IRS will only let you contribute $2500 to your HSA annually. Which means that everything else is directly out of pocket. (My insurance covers almost nothing until the deductible is met.) 


I'm not sure why I am so surprised, but I am. I can't afford that l, though. If I use my HSA for that, then it'll be burned through in a matter of a few months. Then I can't use it to pay for my $100 GP visits and $150 prescriptions. 


I'm sorry for whining - I am grateful to have health insurance as an option at all. I know there are lots of people that don't. But that's what makes me so upset - I am paying the SELF pay options, which means that insurance-less people are charged the same. Who can afford that? It's no wonder so many people are struggling these days - they may not be able to afford to get help.

I hate talking about my 'problems' because they're so insignificant, I couldn't imagine talking with anyone about bad things going on in my life, there's always a 'voice' telling me things like ""nobody cares"" ""bohoo grow up "" ""there people having it worse"" ""this isn't worth being talked about"", But I dont know how any other way to cope with my problems. 

For example: I got hit/mildly abused by my father when I was  a child and (even now) I can hardly write/ can't even think about telling it anybody about it because I feel like its no big deal, cry louder you little shit nobody cares, why should anybody care about your stupid fucking life?

Sometimes I cry myself to sleep and it hurts a bit I feel my chest being under pressure, I get headaches and  I can't breathe properly. The reason is often my thoughts: My brother, mother, dad and boyfriend wouldn't care if I die, I am a waste, I don't deserve to eat, I am worthless, nobody cares, I am alone, I am no use for anyone.

I once got caught crying really bad by my mom and first she thougt that my boyfriend broke up with me but I had no reason other than these thoughts bothering me.

At school I have trouble socializing because I think that people think the same about me and I don't want to bother them with my stupid face. When I make emabarrissing mistakes in school or if I get a bad grade I get these reacouring thoughts and cry in the bathroom and I get irationally angry and hit myself (often leg or hip).

My boyfriend always tells me Im beautiful and he loves me. But I honestly can't belive him, It hurts accepting a compliment but I want to be polite and do it anyways, with the thought: they can't mean that honestly, you look like shit  and who could love that fucked up face, not even a mother.

I've never really reached out and asked this kind of stuff before so if there's a better place I should be posting feel free to let me know.

Anyway, I just want some opinions from people about my feelings regarding friends and family.

I'm a married adult and I would consider myself very introverted (in case that matters?), and I've noticed that people around me have a very small (if any) emotional impact on me, with a few exceptions (my wife, and my mom).

I love and care for my wife and my mom but all of my friends, or any other part of my family, just kind of feels meh.

I can hang out with them, have fun, laugh, but honestly, I could live without them and be totally fine. Sometimes I imagine, what would life e like if something happened to this individual and I can't bring myself to care honestly.

I have no ill thoughts for people or anything like that but I just wonder if I'm in a minority here or if these feelings are more or less common for introverts who find hanging out with people to be a chore.

I'm 33/M, and for the past few years I've been experiencing a constant sense of dread, sometimes to the point where I actually feel like my life is about to end.

&amp;#x200B;

To give an example; the reason I've decided to type this out now is because I'm sitting on my couch at home, I looked up and just noticed that my front door is unlocked.  Upon noticing this, my brain instantly imagined someone walking through the door and shooting me to death.  I live in a good area, and totally understand that the chances of something like this happening in the middle of the day is very, very rare, but it still filled me with a sinking feeling like it's about to happen any second.  This happens randomly and throughout the day, but especially at night when any little noise (I have cats so there are plenty of little noises) makes me think someone just broke in and is coming to kill me.  And an important distinction is between this feeling I have and normal fear;  when I hear a noise at night, I don't think ""uh oh, what's that noise?"" and experience normal anxiety from hearing a strange noise, I think ""That's a person breaking into the house, they're coming up stairs to kill me right now"" and I experience that dread of knowing (even though I don't know) that someone is there.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not on any medications, I don't have a bunch of enemies or anyone that would hate me or want to see harm come my way, and I especially don't believe I've done anything to anyone to warrant someone wanting to harm me.  I'm hoping for more specific advice than ""Go to a doctor"" because I don't have great luck with doctors and usually get the ones who say ""get over it"" whenever I talk to them about a problem.  Like I literally had nerve damage in my leg in high school and even though I wore baggy pants as a kid the doctor I had at the time said ""wear looser pants and walk it off.""  So more specific advice like ""ask your doctor THIS"" or ""See THIS type of medical professional"" would be much more helpful.  Anyway, I appreciate any advice I get, thanks!",21May2019,5

I (23F) am an American living in the UK on a marriage visa. I graduated with a Masters degree 6 months ago. Since then I have been applying nonstop for jobs both in the city I currently live in and in London. Out of the probably hundreds of jobs I've applied for I've gotten ONE interview (which I obviously didn't get). I can't take the discouragement anymore. I know everyone says not to take the rejections personally but after so many I've really started to wonder, every email I get feels like a punch in the gut. Meanwhile, to make ends meet I'm working a shitty degrading dehumanising restaurant job where my managers talk to me like I'm barely human. Every day I have to go work in the restaurant I just feel like more of a failure, especially as I watch my friends flourish in their careers.

&amp;#x200B;

For the past 6 months my partner and I have been on rocky ground, fighting a lot etc. His mental health is the worst that it's been in our entire relationship (4.5 years) and its effected both of us. Whenever he gets really really low he self-sabotages, as well as abuses substances (alcohol/weed) and we have talked about this many times. A few months ago while I was home visiting family he drunkenly downloaded Tinder and messaged a few girls (messages literally said 'hi' etc). Because I didn't feel like this was cheating I decided to forgive him and although it was hard we both worked hard on trying to fix things. I felt like things were getting better, I felt loved and valued, I trusted him again. Then two weeks ago we decided to go out dancing, while going out was my suggestion I talked to him numerous times about the fact that I was wary about him drinking too much. 

He proceeded to get completely black out drunk and make out with another girl 5 feet away from me. I still can't get the image out of my head. The next morning he woke up and couldn't remember a thing (this isn't uncommon for him after a night out so I know he isn't lying). The night it happened I called my family and told them that I wanted to move home. This means my mom has to fly out and help me move all my things because I'm shit broke, which just makes me feel guilty as hell.

Moving home means that I have no choice but to move in with my emotionally abusive and manipulative grandmother who doesn't let me close my bedroom door or cook my own food. She comments about my weight and general life decisions constantly. Even staying with her for 2 weeks before has put my mind in a dark place and now I'm looking at living with her indefinitely while going through the biggest heartbreak of my life. Not only this but moving back to America is the last thing I want to do, I've wanted to come to the UK since I was 16 and dreamed of one day becoming a citizen, but I feel like my partner has left me no choice. I have to give up all the friends I've made here, our cat, and his family (who have become like my own).

I still love and care for him deeply and I know his actions are the result of his mental illness, this is not an excuse of course, but to be honest I feel bad for him and want him to get the help he needs. 

I started seeing a therapist a little while ago and even though its helped me I feel like it just isn't enough. I feel completely hopeless, useless, and broken. I have always believed that things will get better but this time I honestly don't know. My mental health is so bad already and I'm scared at what moving home will do to me. I've tried so hard to be a good partner, a good employee, a good student, and now it just seems like I'm getting punished for it over and over again. I know there's probably no advice anyone can give me but maybe some kind words if you have any, I just want to feel better.

Hey guys,

I   thought I would come here and ask you guys for advice, its been long enough pondering among our friends group why this has happened, perhaps an outside perspective might shed some light on action to take or thoughts on what happened.

Basically  a  bunch of us from school have always been PC gamers and we have always   played together, we all went to high school and college together and   this friend was always part of the group. He was always a strange one at   times and was quite quiet, Im not sure he was always confident at   school for example because to put it bluntly, he was quite big, but   nobody would have expected this. Some time about 3 years ago now, while   he was at university, he just stopped communication with everyone. Now   before you suggest maybe he dosent like us, he has ignored everyone,   even people he never ever had issues with and was always friends with. He would read our messages and never reply. Not even 1 sentence in 3 years.

We  believe he was struggling at  university (another school friend was on  the same course at uni) and  had only made 1 friend, but he was from  China and has since left and nobody has been able to contact him to ask  if he still speaks to this  friend. We are from the UK FYI so not so easy  to figure out who this  guy is.

He  has also deleted his  facebook profile etc, the only way we can contact  him is via steam. And  whenever people messaged him, he would quickly  appear offline. For  example there were times he would be on a game we  were also on and  someone would say, hey 'x' wanna join us?? and he would  instantly  appear offline. Eventually it got to the current stage where  he is  almost permamently offline (appearing offline not actually offline). Back in high school and college, I was at  times  someone who had minor arguments with him, not always his #1 closest  friend but definitely a good friend, and I have always been much more concerned, not that the others are not concerned, they are equally, but they arent the sort of people who would take action etc, ive always messaged him with very passive messages, easy to reply to about random topics etc or asking him for advice, but he never replies. The weird thing was that I one of us unfriended the other, I assume by accident. I then re-added him as a friend and sent a message saying something like   hey im not sure if either of us unfriended the other, but I noticed you werent on my friends list anymore and  sent another request anyway. And he accepted. I dont understand  why. Why  not unfriend us all if he dosent want to talk and all we are is a pest. He also clicks the links I send him (as I am working on a interesting project) but he never replies regarding them, so I know for sure that he is reading them at the very least.

Others  suggested knocking  on his house/phoning up his home, but A) I dont know  where he lives or  his home phone number (he still lives with parents)  and B) I thought  that might be a bit intrusive or not a good idea if  something is a bit  unstable.

Finally I have contacted his older brother, but didnt get great news. He told me that he had fallen out with his parents and had little to no contact with them in the past few years, including his brother whom he also has been unable to contact. He told him over text message and email that we were there for him (as another friend had contacted his brother previously) but had no reply. He thanked me for messaging him every day and being there to show him that we are still here and his friends and told me that, deep inside he will be thankful that I message him daily, and that he would try to get back in contact with him. He also told me that they had moved house a few times (potentially causing stress??)

I  have also asked other  people whom are from a different friends group  but I know he was good  friends with, but they said they havent spoken to  him since college.

What   do you think, what should we do. I miss the dude and wish he would  send  a message, and I am concerned for his mental health, he was never   confident, he was always really overweight and quiet and it sounds like   he had a tough time at university depite being super clever that might   have just shattered any confidence/motivation he had.

TL:DR   - About 3 years ago, a good friend from school one day randomly stopped all communication with everyone, concerned about his mental health?

But during these recent months i've still talked to people and be the one to message them first and yet they don't do that to me not even once. And now my gaming friends also seem to be avoiding me which i can't understand why since i never try to hurt people in any way. Usually those people i called friends usually laugh at my jokes since i always find a way to make a pun out of everything. So by no means I'm being absurd or annoying to people since i can definitely tell if someone is mad cause i'm quite the sensitive person. And I'll try to apologize immediately if i accidentally hurt their feelings. It kinda baffles me a little bit since i can't seem to understand why people wouldn't want to talk to me when i used to talk to them so much and yet they pretend that i don't exist. I am kind of a reserved person so i don't talk about myself a lot. One of those friends seem to appreciate me for dm'ing him and yet he doesn't do the same thing to me. I've asked another one of my friends for a favor and yet they don't seem to be obliged to help me. The person i've talked to the most also seems to be ignoring me but that's probably because he's moved out and lived at a new place for a while and yet never even considered messaging me. Thanks to that i have no one else to talk to. By no means i'm trying to get them to stay. I just wanna know how do those social maniacs get to have fun and loyal to each other and not betray one another. I've been betrayed too many times that I don't feel bothered by it anymore. MAYBE it's because i never want to be too attached to someone since it's been backfiring in the past so i've learned my mistake. Or is it because i'm too reserved? I get that extroverts aren't really the people i can relate to however my introverted friends seem to be avoiding me. I once saw them forming a party in-game and there was like 2 more spaces for members. I tried to join but instead they blocked me (from trying to join the party) so i was a bit confused. What did i do to them? Are they mad at me? Someone badmouthing me behind my back? I honestly can't tell. And at this point i've pretty much been questioning what is a friend exactly. What does it mean to be friends anymore? Someone to talk to? Someone who both enjoys each others presence? Someone you can trust? Or is it just a word we use just to comfort someone who's feeling lonely. Honestly, i'm not too bothered but i really want to understand what it means to have a friend.",21May2019,1

I always thought that I can do this on my own and fight it on my own by just educating myself on it and self help books/sites, which I have a bit but I want to be better. Therapy is something I've thought about doing for a few years I just cant get myself to do it. I'm the type of person that is very reserved and doesn't ask for help even when if I'm really struggling. I'll sit through it rather than ask for help and downplay my emotions. The only person I've ever talked to about this is my bf and it took about 3 years of us dating before I opened up about this to him. 
I recently graduated college and quit my job because school drained me so much and I was just constantly feeling low. At my job I also felt like I didn't make friends and a lot of the time when people talked to me I'd just give 1 worded responses and I wasn't very interactive. I'm really bad at socializing but I also just didn't care enough to be likeable. In college, in my last year I ended up getting my first C's in classes and it brought my GPA down as well as my likeliness to get into grad school. It was just so hard for me to focus and concentrate, I couldn't retain any information whatsoever. I was just constantly tired and didn't want to do anything but sleep. I didnt make any friends in college and I wasnt very sociable either obvisously. 
So far I've been on a 3 month break of no school or work. I signed up take 1 prereq in the summer and applied to another college to retake those 2 classes I got C's in and I'm going to try again for grad school. Which I really don't want to do but I'm forcing myself to do it. I also need to get a job. I'm nervous to get a job and I've found some but I feel like im not good at anything I just kinda suck.

I'm also uninsured and cant afford to pay out of pocket for sessions unless there are cheaper options ...since I dont work right now.

132,"I'm not sure if this counts as a confession, nor do I really know if I actually do enjoy it, but I know myself well enough to make that conclusion. I made this throwaway for a reason. Throughout my life so far, I've had this constant struggle to genuinely feel empathy for others, to feel a sense of power and control. This is due to the bullying and trauma in my childhood that has left me a bit scarred. I had a relatively good childhood, despite its issues and family/school related issues. I've never really believed nor cared about those kids around me, and to this day, I genuinely still wish they were all dead. None of them deserve to lead positive lives. I have always been a introvert and a private person with my life. Not to mention it's easy for me to get frustrated and impulsive when things dont go my way. 

It's somewhat common that I'd have to force myself to act out a certain way whenever people felt sad or depressed, or any feeling really. I always felt awkward whenever people cried or felt bad, because I genuinely didn't care,it wasn't that I didn't understand what was going on with them. The only people I ever loved is my family and my pet, and even then, I can be incredibly cold towards them sometimes. I've always enjoyed having control over situations as long as it didn't involve my family, as I'd feel guilty, not a lot, but enough to make me consider it.

I have developed a short temper due to me suppressing it so much in my childhood along with the constant abuse and powerlessness. My peers in school were always narcissistic and I've always believed they didn't deserve to be happy nor have friends. I loved to fantasize about me simply seeing them dead or suffer badly...I really don't care about them, they never really were meant for anything big, and I would've loved to see them driven to suicide.

I had one relationship which was incredibly toxic, and this girl affected me badly, to the point where I was driven to get revenge on her. I was investigated due to multiple threats I've made. She was a stupid bitch, despite everything I've done, she would've been more than willing to backstab me. Funny part is she still talks to me after so long and tries to get my attention. I realized I never loved her, I just simply wanted someone around me that I could talk to. After her I've found a fascination with corpses/necrophilia and found myself frequently fantaszing more about it than anything.

I highly doubt I'm mentally ill or incapable because I do have feelings,very limited ones, but feelings nevertheless. I'm relatively normal and lead a normal life with a loving family. The only emotions I feel intensively is anger, frustration, or sadness. Besides that most of the time I'm just emotionally blank, as if I don't really feel much unless it's someone close to me. I've never had trouble with the law nor do I do reckless things besides spending all of my money, and everyone sees me as a very kind, mild-mannered, cute looking guy. I love that, but yet I can't really connect with anyone at all. It's like no matter how hard I try, those emotions aren't there to help me feel it genuinely.

My biggest struggle is that I don't feel powerful, nor do I feel like in control. I absolutely HATE that. if given any sense of control over anyone, I'd take it to do whatever pleases me. While one side, I'd do the right and appropriate thing, I want to do the things that make me feel something positive for once. I want to have that drive again, to have that willingness and opportunity to get someone, pin them down and keep them controlled by me. I would keep it to myself for all these years, but I know I want to control everything and have all of the control I desire out of life. This is my confession, I know I think like a horrible person, but I genuinely have to come to terms with it. 

TL:DR: I Basically don't believe I am mentally Ill or incapable of thought because I do feel a limited range of emotions and am aware of those around me, yet I struggle to understand myself well enough conclude if this is something I should be worried about in the long-term. I feel like I have a good grip of these thoughts, but there are days where I have mental breakdowns and I genuinely fantasize intensively about having absolute control over people and my surroundings. No one ever believes that I think like this because I'm considered a very mild-mannered and kind person, but those thoughts still remain there and I'm aware.",21May2019,2
133,It is exactly how it sounds unfortunately. I've recently had a bit of a mental break after a few life setbacks and I've been feeling suicidal recently. To cope I started to log what time my neighbour got back in from work then what he does by listening in the morning with the bed at the wall. I work from home so I hear him come back in the evening. In all honest frankly he doesn't have much of a life.,21May2019,1
134,"TW:Suicidal Thoughts; 
I recently moved from a public school system to an IB private school. I had heard horror stories about the IB program as a whole, but dismissed them, assuming they were just hyperbolic. Jokes on me, they weren't. Maybe it's just my school, but there is no support for students, and the workload is immense. Students are essentially shamed if they cannot get the perfect 6s and 7s, and I've honestly had enough. I used to be incredibly suicidal when I was 13/14 years old, but had pulled myself out of that rut, which was something I was pretty proud about. I had just started to learn how to love myself and accept my  flaws as a part of me. 
This program ruined all of that in a manner of 8 months. I used to think I was pretty smart; I wasn't a valedictorian by any means, but I had a good average overall. 
The IB program has no support system for kids who come in from a non-IB/public school. Obviously, it's a bit ridiculous to expect to be catered to, but there is nothing. If there is a counselor at my school, they are not readily available; I've searched my school website and there is no mention of there being one. Maybe this is just a difference in European schools, but honestly, I don't believe schools are unaware that kids have problems that are valid and need to be dealt with. 

My grades have dramatically fallen, my teachers have no restraint in belittling their students, and the school does not care. The students here pay 32 000 $ (CAD) per year, and yet the school apparently cannot find a counselor, or just neglect to advertise them. Mental health is swept under the rug; two people I've known in the IB have killed themselves, in part due to the IB, over the past year and a half. 

All the progress I made when I was younger has been destroyed. The thoughts of killing myself are all-consuming, and honestly I've had enough. 

I don't really expect anyone to read this, I know it's kinda a huge wall of text, but I needed to get this off my chest.

135,"My depression and anxiety had its up and downs ever since I first started working. It went downhill in March when despite having a great therapist and taking meds, I got very suicidal. I was on the edge of the subway platform. I felt like a failure.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been on sick leave since then. I thought I had disappointed so many people in my life, but my therapist has helped me in forgiving myself and moving on little by little. I decided not to go back to my current teaching position for the next school year, which will cause financial instability, but I'm in such a better mentality. Being close with my mom, she has noticed that I smile and talk more, and that what she thought was ""normal stress"" was me barely managing my depression the past three years. I was desperate to ""fix myself,"" and to just ""suck it up because everyone has work stress.""

&amp;#x200B;

I have so much respect for teachers. I am interviewing for other schools, but I will most likely do a mix of tutoring/sub work/reception. I am still sad that I couldn't push through another school year, but I am feeling happier that I don't have to go back. I have options. And maybe someday, I will go back to the classroom in the future. I'm working on hobbies I've completely abandoned when I was working. Teaching is a huge commitment. I have mixed feelings about my ideal work situation, but I'm glad I'm taking the time to reflect and slowly plan my next steps.

&amp;#x200B;

My meds and therapy helped a little, but what I needed most was a change of circumstances. I am only human. 

It's still hard forgiving myself fully, but I'm trying.",21May2019,414
136,"I was reading some of the questions people submit on psychcentral and the answers the therapists there give. I noticed some of the answers given by one of their therapists Kristina Randle were just super judgmental and off and were even flat out incorrect... like mixing up symptoms of one personality disorder for the other and confusing different mental disorders into one. I then saw her profile on the site which claims she has a phd and is a practicing psychotherapist and a professor, but there's no information about which university/where she practices. Then i tried to find any of this information online and there is nothing! Literally nothing about her other than her claiming to have a phd and be a professor and websites quoting her claim and things she's written on her blog before as if she's an authority worth quoting. There is no proof of where she got her phd, anything about her dissertation, where she lives, where she practices, where she is a professor. I asked a friend who is a practicing therapist and she said that it's super sketchy and she's seen people make up that they are licensed professionals before for attention. I think it is very damaging to people online who believe this person and the crackpot shit she's writing online. Does anyone else find this shit really bizarre?",21May2019,2
137,"My life feels worthless most of the time. 23F. Life has literally been a rollercoaster:  
8-12 stalked by pedo online and IRL, who also lived in my dads city  
13 sexually abused and raped by a 16 year old (from online of course, because dah, the internet is super safe for kids)  
13-16 depressed, diagnosed but no meds  
18 diagnosed bipolar disorder 2 on meds

Obviously, there's so much shit before, in between and after, but a book would be needed for that. Currently, however, my main issue is my sister. I got four siblings, all of whom got some sort of mental disorder'ish genes. Three of us; My brother, sister and me, diagnosed bipolar 1, ADHD and bipolar 2 respectively.

So when I saw my sister a month ago (I live in another country than my whole family because I ""escaped"" for uni, yay manic episode or something) she told me how none of us were ""created by love"" (Mum dad got forced to marry due to religion and divorced when I and my twin were 6 (we are the youngest)). She told me how she was abused for years by a babysitter and it started when she still had nappies (apparently I already knew this but had forgotten it). She also said that mum once drove off with her and left her by a bus stop and told her to look for a new family. Mum eventually came back though. Then my sister said the thing that makes me sad every day; ""we have never been best friends"". She said this because when mum and dad divorced, all of us separated and only me and my twin went with mum. She said that she and our other sister fought over the bathroom in the mornings and that she and I never had shared anything like that. But, my sister has always been my hero. I have always adored her. I loved hearing her sing. I wanted to be like her when I grew up. When she said that we have never been best friends, it literally broke my heart. 

Last night I cried in bed because of what she said and I made my boyfriend think I cried because of something else. I haven't told him this because a lot of the time he isn't very supportive regarding my mental health. But then again, living with someone who is bipolar can't be easy that either. 

This part is a little NSFW, so skip it if you're not comfortable hearing about intimacy and child abuse. &gt;!When I and my boyfriend have sex, recently I have not been able to stop thinking of my sister and the babysitter. It has thrown me off my game so much. I've been through my own shit regarding sexual abuse, but I've never really had a problem with it when I'm with someone I love. A picture of my sister in her nappy and a 16 year old boy forcing his dick on her pops into my mind every time. It bothers me, as it would bother most people. I don't know how long it'll take until I get my libido back and can actually make love again without thinking of that. !&lt;

I don't know how I should forget about everything my sister told me. Somehow I did forget it at one point, but it feels like the information is engraved in my mind permanently this time and I can't force myself to forget. When I saw my mum again after I had visited my sister (it had literally been a day) I could barely look at her. I can't forget the fact that my sister said that mum just took her to a bus stop. Oh yeah, apparently mum also accused her of touching my twin brother. As in touching touching. My sister wouldn't lie, but then I don't understand how mum could have done those things. It made me look differently at her and I feel super confused about it.

This was all the information that my sister definitely should not have told me. Things I did not want to know and things that would hurt me if I knew. I wish my sister realised that when she was telling me about it. Instead, she thought my reactions was me having a depressed period, but I was actually quite happy to be home and see family (until that point of course). 

Up till that point, my plan in life was to finish university, start my career in this country and then move back with my boyfriend to my home country close to my family. Today, I don't know if I want to do that anymore. Honestly, if my boyfriend died, I would die with him. Suicide hotline no.1. I would not want to move back to my family, even though I do love them. I just don't want to move there... But this country ""sucks"" too, as I don't have many friends and only colleagues etc, and super annoying coursemates at uni. 

My ambitions and goals in life just went like poof after that trip home. 

Clap clap to anyone who made it through my dysfunctional writing. Honestly I just want some advice about my issues and how to move on. It's really hard to talk to my boyfriend about all this, he is another issue but it's too long and probably too boring to read much more. We love each other though, that's the important part. So any advice?",21May2019,1

140,"The shift started off fine, I was energetic and excited to start the day. Then within the course of 30 minutes I just felt my mind start to slip. Excitement turned into hopelessness, the positive energy I was feeling before quickly turned into irrational anger. Then that anger quickly burnt me out, what followed was coldest, darkest pit of depression I've felt in all my years of struggling with this crap. My coworkers started to realize something was wrong, most of them were asking if I was okay and I'd just respond with ""Yeah I'm fine,"" which was a downright lie... I just didn't know what to actually say or what I was actually feeling in that moment. On the other hand, a select few were giving me really dirty looks like I insulted them somehow, and it was in those moments that I felt I took a massive blow to my dignity. I was ashamed of how I was feeling and even more so that I brought those feelings to work with me. When the night was wrapping up and we were closing up the restaurant, I hit a brick wall. My knees kept buckling as I tried to walk and I started to feel like I was about to faint, so I sat down on the steps and tried to recollect myself. My manager walked by and asked if I was alright and I simply told her that I didn't get much sleep last night (another lie, I had 13 hours.) She asked me if I wanted to go home and let the other bussers close up shop, that's when I felt my lip quivering and my eyes watering. My thoughts quickly spiraled into what felt like a single point where I could hear and feel all of my thoughts and emotions at once, all just screaming at me and throwing my mind about like a rag doll. I got home and looked at my backdoor, thinking ""what's next? oh right... keys, I need my keys."" So I sat down to unzip my backpack and grab my keys, and just kept sitting there for hours staring blankly into the backyard. When I felt myself coming down from the whole ordeal, I told myself that I never want to feel like that again. I know its going to happen again, and that I have just proved to myself that I cannot fend off the demons alone. So the next day I did some research and found a few therapists and psychiatrists in the area and set up on appointment. I'm not sure how I'm supposed to be feeling now. On one hand I feel at least a little bit hopeful for the near future, on the other hand I can't help but to feel ashamed for letting those feelings effect me at work. I feel like I let down my coworkers and the restaurant, but more so I feel like I let myself down. I just hope these appointments in the coming days go well, as I'm not sure how much longer I can handle these breakdowns.",21May2019,1

I'm 21 years old male, i live in Georgia and for a few years im dealing with this huge problem.

Last 4 years were very stressful for me, lots of anxiety, fears, anger, despair, violence.  It will take too long to explain everything, basically i believe i'm dealing with PTSD, panic attacks and anger issues. 

Example: Back when i was a child/teen, watching a horror movie or being in a place with loud noises wasn't a problem, i had this mental strength, now if im watching a horror or melodramatic scenes i feel depressed, i'm starting to thing about all the most nasty horrible stuff that might happen to me or my family, imagining fake scenes where i have to react fast to save someone, and its repeating.
I feel how my mind is falling apart, especially when i'm in metro where theres loud noises, i feel like my legs might stop listening to me and fall down and cover my ears.
I also imagine fake scenes of awkward situations especially in public places. I feel this rage and jealousy which ruins my relationships 
I feel like i can't control my mind. 

I must also mention that i'm a student and the country i live in, psychologists are not very popular and it's a ""luxury"".

145,"Over the last few weeks I've been struggling with pretty dark and scary thoughts. It isn't the first time I've had to deal with this kind of thing. Two years ago is when I think it started, subtle-ish signs such as feeling overly nervous when I was alone, crying A LOT more than usual and just generally feeling unlike myself. I just powered through because I didn't think it was a big deal. ""It's just a teen thing"" I thought. Last year I started feeling worse, I began starving myself, but the situation I was in at the time forced me to eat the bare minimum so that I didn't collapse. Thankfully, someone who I was around quite a bit noticed that I hadn't been eating for a the best of a week and I trusted him enough to tell him how I felt. 

I thought I was one the fast track to getting better, but just two weeks after, I started cutting myself. I didn't notice how amazing this guy was at the time but when I think back on it I can't believe how easy he saw that I was in pain, even when  I was trying to put up a positive front. Can't help but feel grateful towards him even though we don't anymore.

If you happen to be reading this (and I doubt you are) oh so wise and rightful leader of Jibompkus, you know who you are, just know I'm thankful for your help, and even though I'm still struggling, I don't think I could be managing as well as I am without your amazing encouragement. xxx

&amp;#x200B;

Back to what I was saying. As you can tell by what I've just written, this isn't the first time I've had to deal with mental struggles. It just happens that this time it's quite a bit more severe than before. Suicide after all isn't something to be toyed around with and as much as I'm keeping myself in a place where I can stop or move away from the thoughts even just for the smallest of moments, I do worry A LOT that I will one day be faced with a moment that might take me a little further over that line. After all, my mental state HAS been getting worse as the years tick by.

&amp;#x200B;

I've wanted to get counselling for awhile now, and even after someone who kindly spoke to me through this forum told me some very important things about it, I have yet to gather the courage to go through and ask for an appointment. This is, oddly enough, due to the fact that my best friend and own father have had counselling, my friend still having sessions once a week since a few months ago. You'd think this would be encouraging. But no, my father said to be that his sessions made him feel worse by dragging things up that he had long forgotten and my friend coming out crying and actually wondering if therapy was SUPPOSED to make you feel that bad.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to risk others finding out that I'm struggling by starting counselling. I just don't think I could handle it.

150,"Hi.

For the sake of my own privacy (and because i'm a very private person), I'm doing this on a throwaway account (i'm sure that's a fairly common thing though tbh).

So i'm a uni student in the UK and i'm a few days off my final submission for my dissertation, with nothing resembling a finished project. This year has been the toughest in my life, and lately, it feels like everything is crunching down. It's not that I can't do the work, I'm actually pretty good at what I do (in first year, I got a 1st and second year was a 2:1), but I just felt awful all the time and wanted to do things that made me feel good. At the start of the year, this was just feeling bad and wanting to just sleep it off or something. But now, I feel like i'm approaching a real wall. Anything that would normally make me feel good eventually tires me out and I zone out. I get panicked a lot and at first, this was manifesting itself as panic attacks, but now I feel like I just don't care. If I fail, I fail. And the sad thing is I don't care that much anymore if I do. But despite this, every day I struggle to wake up, wanting to just sleep rather than think of the impending deadline. I feel like I blew it all, and I don't know if it's on me. I've went to my academic advisor and one thing stuck with my recently, they said that for a long time now, I've just not seemed right.

I don't want to add excuses for my own failures, if I screwed up it's my fault, but the past few years have been rough. My grandfather is dying of cancer, my great aunt (who I was close to) died 6 weeks after getting diagnosed with cancer, my brother killed himself 2 years ago at the start of my second year (this in particular ended up being... a bit of a journey in a few ways). My dad's been dead for 14 years now. And in the last 4-5 years, I've had to deal with one nephew who is ill and will likely die before he's 18, and another who is so severely braindamaged, that it just makes it seem like there's something about our family that attracts the worst type of luck.

Now that i kinda know the language (B1), this school year I went like a normal student and had to get grades. Since the start of the year I noticed that I lost all will and motivation for studying.

I should probably mention that I don't have real friends and  I barely have any social interactions other than school. I go to the gym, but I didn't made any friends there.

My grades got lower on the first half of the year.I always procrastinated things (mostly related to studying and assignments and I never did homework) to the last moment. I think I did that before too, but since this school year my procrastination kinda got 10 times bigger than ever before. For instance last week i had 3 major exams that are important for my future and I studied the day before for every exam. Tommorow I have another exam to write and I spent the whole day lurking at reddit, instagram and YouTube.

So some time ago my company conducted a performance review, where I was told that my skills and experience are irrelevant for the company and, although they like me on a social level, I should ideally start looking elsewhere. I am a lawyer and there is positively 0 chance of finding a job anywhere else (or even outside the law) in my current circumstance.  Now it feels like the past 17 years of law schools of working and studying in several countries, multiple bar exams, sleepless nights, missed opportunities etc are all for nothing. Honestly at a loss and don’t know what to do or where to go from now. I pretty much feel like a walking dead, with no hope whatsoever. 

Don’t think anything can be done, but just saying it all out loud makes it feel slightly less painful.",21May2019,1
154,"Sorry if this is disorganized I'm in a bad way. I don't know where to start so if this is a little rushed please forgive me.

I'll try and give some background. I am 26 male and have a history of mental health problems, drug addictions, depression and failures in life. 

I currently not employed. Have a flat with my fiance we've been together 2 years.

Long story short I feel like I have nowhere to turn. I don't want to talk to anyone because they all have their own problems. My dad is usually good but he's not been well. My mum just stresses me out. My fiance has BPD and is so up and down herself I can't really speak to her deeply.

So earlier one of my friends (i consider I've been pretty good to and we were good friends) has let me down. A problem I envisaged he would be of more help with he was rather unhelpful with and seemed to take someone else's side (who he has no real reason to be so far up their ass because it's pretty black and white they aren't true to their word). 

Anyway it was a stress and has left me considerably short of money. So then after this I got annoyed a bit but also got thinking, and I don't think any of my mates really put me in their list of people they're there for. I have no friends I feel are there for me. 

I tried to get some fresh air. Then my fiance wanted to come. I'm pretty flustered and things banding about in my head. So say maybe the space and fresh air would do me good. But she looked pissed off at me saying that. Then she was asking where I was going. After I'd already said I was going to my dad's 3 times before this and she was going to come, to my dad's. As if she didn't trust if that's where I was going.

I feel this is often an issue with her. Only I have never really given her any reason to doubt me like that. I haven't ever cheated on her or anything and am very supportive. She has epilepsy and BPD. It's pretty hard living with her sometimes as she gets upset so often to the point I feel sometimes it's hard to be honest with her because she just cries and I'll just upset her everytime. Like now for instance I have gone to bed in a dark room and she is crying. Basically after me saying I just need space then not being very responsive when she tried to cuddle me after I'd said about the walk then never went cos I said it feels like she doesn't trust me and I'm just going to bed (at 8pm).

I feel alot of the time like I have to remain calm and keep things together for the both of us. Take alot of stress. But I'm starting to feel a bit like we are operating on different frequencies.

I also feel alot like I am no use at anything and everything I do turns to shit. This part is crucial.

Also I do not take heroin or any hard drugs (have had amphetamine, MCAT, ketamine and cocaine addictions in the past)...but I spent twenty minutes honestly thinking of messaging a junkie I know to see if he could score me a gram of heroin so I could shoot the whole lot up at once and kill myself. So I would never have to deal with any of the people in this small minded town again. Backwards thinking, gossiping, small minded idiots. 

I just want to be alone, in the dark, away from all the noise. I have accepted I have no one I can really talk to, no one who really seriously understands me. I just want to be dead. But I do not want to be selfish and ruin my mother father and fiance's lives by taking the easy way out.

Help me please someone because right now I want to die.",21May2019,1
155,"You'll have seen this question time and time again, but some specific advice to our situation would be appreciated.

Two month relationship, and I really like my ex. She's a great woman with a lot of positive attributes. Unfortunately, she also has a few issues (as do we all), with anxiety and depression being the main problems. To cut a long story short, we have had an on-off relationship in that time, and whilst I know it would probably be best advised to walk away...I care for this woman, have been in this position before, and know what it's like not to have support.

In terms of our relationship, it would manifest itself in ways such as feeling insecure about my female friends for the most part, but also hesitancy to communicate and ""fight and flight' responses, which stem from abuse in the past.

So, for now, we've ended the relationship. We are staying in contact, and she has got therapy booked (as well as trialing new meds). I am willing to support her, but I would like advice on how.",21May2019,1
156,"I'm approaching my late 20s and I feel stuck career-wise. I know if I had a reasonable game plan, I could get myself out of this rut. I just don't know where to start. So I'm posting to ask if anyone has a story or advice you're willing to share about  a time in your life when you moved past a seemingly-permanent hiatus. 

Some background: I've been treated for depression &amp; anxiety in the past and eventually got out of a severe spell \~2 years ago. Since recovery I've been back to ""high-functioning"" mode. I'm not on meds anymore and can't afford to see a therapist. I quit a lousy job about a year ago (mentally draining) and have just been doing contract work here and there to stay afloat. I have two science-related bachelor's degrees, but not sure how I can get a job or go to grad school without relevant references, plus there's the issue of the employment gap. I'm also seeing signs of worsening depression (reluctant to leave the house, low appetite). It's almost as if having no course of action is slowly paralyzing my ability/desire to do anything to propel my career (though I try to maintain healthy habits like exercise, and I start volunteer work soon). I think I'm experiencing that classic first-step syndrome. But how do I take the first step if I don't know what it should be?",21May2019,1

I walked out of therapy angry today. I’m being put on zoloft again because of anxiety and apparently my lack of boundaries in relationships. I didn’t want to be put back on medicine. The last time I took zoloft was when I was 16 and depressed and now I’m 19 with an array of other issues about to take zoloft again. I know this is probably the right thing for me but it makes me so fucking angry? Why me??? Out of all people, why fucking ME? Why am I screwed up?

163,"Hi guys. I’m a 20 year old female who lives with 
parents who undermine me as person. My dad belittles me, calling me useless, worthless and says things that really hurt. My mom says I dont do anything around the house (which is true because I’m so in tuned with getting A’s in college). Either way, my brother gets the better treatment even though he got kicked out of college and is now at community. He doesn’t do anything but play on his computer. I’m always the one to get the blame. My dad always puts all his hate on me and it causes me to cry and have depressive thoughts. I always thought parents are there to pick you up and support you but my parents think I’m useless. Ever since I was in middle school, my dad would remind me that I would not get anything from him in the future, also I would be kicked out of the house when I turn 18. I’ve been hit, mentally and verbally abused. Having this thought of being worthless at a young age has really made me depressed and I haven’t told anyone about it. I mainly don’t tell people because I feel like no one goes through this and I don’t know how to open up about it. I’ve been debating whether or not going to a psychiatrist, but I don’t want my parents to know. This is impossible because they pay for my insurance. 
There’s another option: try talking to them. I’ve done that. If my dad doesn’t get it his way, he’ll try finding ways to put you down, either by shaming you through physical appearance or comparing you to someone else...

My dad actually hit me in the head (a few months ago) and caused me to bleed when I told him I had a boyfriend of another race that he doesn’t like. That relationship (of almost 2 years) I had with my boyfriend was terrible because I had to be so discreet and my bf couldn’t understand as to why I can only see him at certain times. 
I told my dad I was gonna kill myself because of him and why he wouldn’t let me date the love of my life , but he didn’t care one bit. He was scared for me at that time but he still goes on to tell me I’m a bitch and I’m not worth anything. 

He plays 2 lives. He goes to church every Sunday, donates money, and is part of the volunteer committee. And then he comes home, drinks a lot, is abusive to his kids and was formerly abusive to his wife. People don’t know what happens in our household because he tries to act innocent, but in reality he’s immoral and malicious. 

He makes a lot of money and his wealth is his ego. And so since he is the “breadwinner” of the household, he thinks he can dictate people. 
If he doesn’t get what he wants, he will threaten you, shame you on appearance, compare you to someone else, or if it gets to the point where he’s really angry, violence. 

I try being nice to my dad but how can I when I’ve endured so much pain for several years?",21May2019,10

I spoke to a therapist once when I realized there was something wrong with my head, and all she did was send me an email on the love languages.... how is that supposed to help.

She was absolutely sure of it and when I told her I hadn’t touched them she thought I was lying.

So I call my father to go check, and sure enough they’re there. I knew they hadn’t been moved. Now she’s upset, saying that she’s going crazy.

I know I'm not supposed to be comparing myself to others since I'm my own person who does things at my own pace, which is why I hate this mindset!

169,"On the 26th of April I had a very chronic panic attack. It only lasted about a minute and a half, but my brain experiences weeks of the hangover. Derealization, depersonalization, numb, sick, stiff, depressed, anxious, rumination, the whole nine yards. Each day gets a little bit better, I feel more “here” which is the most important thing to me. I was upped to 40mg of Celexa and prescribed .25 of Klonopin in the mornings. Again, day by day inches of recovery. The only thing I noticed that hasn’t truly gotten better is how tight my neck and head still are. And due to this, my senses are dull. Example being I can tolerate hotter stuff, and it seems like my brain isn’t getting the signal to tell me that it’s not and I need to stop touching it. Some one can hide around a corner and jump out and scare me- my body itself will jump but I have no sensation in my head. Will this also eventually go away? Is it my nervous system still in knots over itself? I’ve experienced this sensation before, but this is the longest it’s ever last, being almost a month now. Any scientific explanation or am I dwelling on this too much? My therapist told me to practice more self care and such, a big part of my downfall.",21May2019,1

173,"So today at lunch me and a couple friends were just chillin on the field at school having fun and talking. I was messing around with My friend Jackson while I was right next to my other friend Jack. Jack has a history of mental illness but it never really shows at all and he’s really chill. 

I tried doing a handstand but fell and my legs hit Jack. I didn’t even think about nor did anyone else because we are best friends and we always mess around with each other and hit each other and stuff like that, but never ever any actual  fighting or even any arguing. 

He looks at Jackson and says “Get Kyle the fuck out of here before I beat the shit out of him”. I overheard that and turned around and said “Wait what why what did I do” and he gets up and starts yelling at me, but I didn’t argue back or anything I just tried to calm him down because I know he isn’t doing very well and probably has a lot of built up emotions. But he keeps telling at me and saying he’s gonna kick my ass (btw we’ve been friends for like 1.5 years now and we have gone through everything with eachother and always had a great relationship) 
He then starts chasing after me saying he’s gonna kick my ass and calling me a pussy and a little bitch and stuff like that. My friend Soren runs and restrains him while he’s still yelling and we’re all just trying to calm him down and not argue or anything. 

My friends Fabian and Phoenix went to go talk to him to see what’s up and if he’s ok and if he needs someone to talk to.

(I still haven’t heard what they said to him or what he said, but I will be learning soon what happened in that convo and I will update you guys) 

So anyway, he’s in tears and telling them what’s up while the rest of us are just kinda watching. We all felt bad and weren’t mad at him at all because we know his situation. 

During the transition from 6th to 7th period I saw Jack in the bathroom and waved at him. 
He just looked away from me.

I went up to Fabian after school and asked him if I should go talk to Jack to see if we’re good and to see what’s going on and to just be chill again. Fabian’s face changes and he says “Hellllll no” apparently Jack is still really really mad at me and says if I approach him he’s beating my ass.

175,"Some background first: I'm 22, and I've been struggling with depression on and off for the past 5 or 6 years. I have Aspergers syndrome, (comparatively) mild Tourettes, and as a kid I developed a stress-indused psychosis. As I've improved over the past year, I've realised some things about myself, and I have been talking to a therapist about most of it. I just had my final session with her a little over a month ago, and I only just found the words to describe something I've realised I've felt my entire life; I don't feel at home in my body.

And this isn't about not liking the way I look. I have struggled with that, but that's different. This is more about my experience of myself. When I look down on my body, I often don't recognise myself. It feels as if I've entered an adult man's body, and that I don't belong. Looking back, this was a massive source of distress during my teenage years, as my body matured. I felt less and less like I was myself, and I was afraid of every sign of maturation and masculinity. I still remember thinking back then that I am relieved I'm not a girl, since developing breasts would've sent me into a panic.

Sometimes I become painfully aware of my body, and every little sensory input. The way my pants are touching my leg, the way my arm is mildly hot, the way my hair is pushed by the wind. In situations like those, the sense of touch gets turned up so high that every one of those small touches become painful. Other times, especially when I'm tired, it feels as if there are tiny needles on the inside of my skin, prickling my body. I remember once my mom had me try mindfulness, and it was unbearable. Being told to focus on just being present in my own body was excruciating, and I didn't even last 5 minutes.

For years I've experienced what I've always called mild out-of-body experiences when I look in the mirror. I suddenly realise that I'm me, and that the person I'm seeing isn't just someone I know, but is actually me. In moments like those, it feels as if I'm suddenly pulled back into my body. I guess that's more of an into-body experience or something like that.

Whenever I'm tired, but have to be social, I feel as if I'm watching the world from further inside my head than usual. I don't feel like my actions are completely mine. It's as if there's an extra layer between me and my body. Like with laggy controls in a game, or trying to steer a mildly reluctant horse. Like what I'm trying to do is just a suggestion, which my body can decide whether it wants to follow or not. Especially because of how focused on introspection I usually am, not feeling in control of my own actions is painful.

I decided to write here because I'm confused about this. I've ended my therapy, and won't be able to get an appointment for awhile. I've been unable to Google anything, since everything I've been able to find has been about body-positivity or dysphoria. I would really like to hear some takes on what could be the cause of this, if it has a name or if anyone has experienced anything similar. I'm grasping at straws here, so any input would be highly appreciated.",21May2019,3
176,"So for the past few years I’ve really been struggling with my mental health with feelings of complete unhappiness and then overwhelming feelings of anxiety for almost everything I did. I recently decided to seek help (but there’s a long wait till the next available appointment) after my first year of college, which should have been an exciting and fun year, has been one that’s just left me feeling incredibly lonely, lost, anxious and numb. I found myself backing out of a lot social occasions or lost opportunities at mingling because I was either too anxious and talked myself out of it or my mood was so low I couldn’t bring myself to do it. Everything has just become so terrifying and I feel so guilty like I’ve completely let myself down. My GP said they can offer me counselling but the next appointment isn’t for 4 weeks, which I took but until then I feel a little stuck. I’m absolutely devastated my first year has been ruined by my mental health and that everything I hoped it would be turned out the opposite and I just really don’t want my second year to be the same. I really wanted to make the most of the opportunities to meet new friends or love interests and learn a subject I love, and I’ve not managed any of these. Are there any tips people could recommend to make things more manageable? Four weeks seems a world away and if there’s anything I can try to get a start on bettering myself sooner rather than later I’d be over the moon.

177,"I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar type ii before but I don’t know how accurate that diagnosis is. 
I had a very strange and severe mental breakdown around 2 am on Sunday. I spoke gibberish and wrote down things in my phone. I was incredibly emotional yesterday all day and today until my friend called me in major concern and terrified me with how he felt my life was going. 

I have been seeing the same therapist regularly and trying to recover from an eating disorder (I have binge eating disorder, have gained like 140 lbs, am obese now) but it’s continually spiraled out of control as well as my issues with social media addiction and lonelieness, etc. 

All I’m saying is that I have all of these overwhelming issues and even though I am getting help, I don’t feel motivated at all.

178,"Throwaway, for obvious reasons. 

When I was a child, I was happy until I was about  three or four. My father died before I was born. When I was about two my mom remarried. My step dad was just as much as a child as she was, my mom was 18 and my step dad was 19. I remember my step dad when he was happy, before his mom died. That was somewhere around ‘98. After that he became distant. 

From then until 2006 he was just overworked and exhausted. We kinda lived in a “don’t mess with dad, when he’s home from work” house. There were just odd things that would set him off. 

I specifically remember a moment when they gave out free dictionaries at school, I remember accidentally sneezing on the side of the book leaving a permanent stain. One day I was having trouble with my math homework and my dad explained it to me probably four or five times, then he got frustrated and started yelling at me, calling me lazy. I remember his spit landing on my face. (For some reason typing this is making me angry... anyways.) I felt like crying but he would hit me or mock me so I don’t remember if I cried or if I held it back so it wouldn’t trigger something. It was just overwhelming, I didn’t know what to do but cry. To this day I feel weak and insecure because of stuff like that. My dad saw the book and asked me how I got it, then he accused me of stealing it and kept hitting me calling me a liar. When I kept repeating the same thing and eventually crying he said something mean and walked off. 

My ears rang a lot as a kid. I don’t know why. Only in typing this out did I have some memory of my skin burning and my ears ringing. Like that numb floaty feeling. I don’t know if he was just strong or his hands were that big but it felt like getting slapped with a steak when he hit me in the head. 

That’s kinda how my childhood went. Anxious, crazy, overbearing mom. Abusive angry dad. I shouldn’t have children. 

2006 is important because that’s the year my little sister was born. It was also the year when my stepdad had his heart attack. I wished he had died then for years, but at the time we were all afraid. Despite all the shit, we loved him, and it was cruel and unfair for a 29 year old with four kids to die suddenly and unexpectedly. I am 24, my partner is 27, I can’t imagine being in my parent’s shoes. After that, he got angrier, depressed, developed PTSD, started abusing painkillers, and was at death’s door on a daily basis.

Two things happened at this point. 1. I became a teenager and my parents pulled me out of school. Why? They’re crazy and they’re shit at raising kids. The last grade I completed was sixth grade, I never went to high school, I never had friends, I never did anything as a teenager. Except be angry and fall into a void of entertainment and literature. I stayed at home and took care of the house and my siblings for close to a decade. 2. Both my parents became abusive.

From that I look at my life and I don’t feel... here. I don’t like being alive. I feel like I’m a child and I don’t know how to just grow up already, and if I did I know I’d probably just feel like I skipped a few steps. I wish I was able to be ignorant, to learn how to socialize, enjoy my youth. Now I’m an adult and I’m forced to be responsible. I like it I guess, but I often yearn for my early twenties to be... normal. I wish I could’ve gone to college. I wish I could have the stories everyone else has. I wish I didn’t feel like a waste all the time. I feel empty and undeveloped.

Now I’m an adult and all that’s left for me is responsibility. The love of my life seems set on living an adult life full of responsibility, and I’m stuck unsatisfied and unhappy.

179,"Long story short, I’m 24 years old. Never had a job in my life. Dropout of high school 5 years ago. And my mental health problems have gotten worse. From suicidal thoughts to social anxiety. I can’t go outside without panicking or rehearsing everything I’m going to say. However, I’m planning on visiting an adult school where I have the option of getting a high school diploma. I am also now trying to get any job. Having no work experience nor an education has made it a bit harder for me. In other words, my nonexistent past is catching up with me. So if there’s any kid here enrolled in high school and you have thought of dropping out, please think twice before making such decision.

Anyways, back to my question. A few people have recommended the military. Of course. But should I really try joining? I didn’t think that was possible given my history with mental health. Although, I have dealt with it on my own. Meaning, I have no medical record of it.

Thank you for taking the time to read my post.",21May2019,1
180,"When I was about 10 I came up with this weird fantasy where my favourite fictional characters/band members/etc were watching me and living in my house and shit. Kinda like ghosts, I can’t see them but they’re always there. It started off as a cool little thing, kinda typical kid shit but I never grew out of it.

They change depending on what I’m interested in, once I get interested in something the fictional characters slowly start coming into my life. For some reason I got it in my head that buying merch of the show basically brings them to my house. It’s got worse and worse over the years, it’s just been bothering me and I KNOW it’s bullshit and I KNOW it’s obviously not true but I can’t get it out of my head no matter how hard I try. I’m so sick of it, I feel watched all the time and judged and I can’t even enjoy watching the show or looking at things related to it because I feel like they’re there watching me and it creeps me out. I just wanna like something without feeling watched, I just wanna be free again. I’m so mad at myself I came up with this bullshit thing almost 5 years ago and it’s still here. I spend all my time in bed under my sheets so they can’t see me and it’s so fucking shitty I hate it

Google won’t do anything I’ve spent hours trying to find someone like me or just some kind of advice and I couldn’t find anything. I tried to tell therapy once and they looked at me like I was crazy and never talked with me about it again, so I stopped going and this is the only other thing I can think of. How do I get this to stop?? I’m so tired of it man I just want to feel free again, I know I sound crazy but I need this to stop. I don’t have many other mental issues apart from this, no hallucinations or anything like that. Just this bullshit I can’t get out of my head. I’m sorry for typing so much, this post is a mess but I’ve never talked or even typed about it and I need this to stop, it’s affecting my daily life and I feel so hopeless, I just want to be normal again.",21May2019,2

186,"I post on here a lot but you all usually have good advice.

so I recently got put on meds for apathy (which you can see from my other posts on here is Wellbutrin) and I’ve been doing pretty well with it

until today

so for context, I’m graduating high school this year and yesterday was my last full day of school. tomorrow I take two exams in the morning and then my grade school experience is over. I’ve honestly been pretty depressed over it, considering it’s all I’ve known for the large majority of my life and being alone is a really scary prospect (I’ll be going to college in another state at the end of August). so you can imagine I’m already not in the best mental state.

so the big exam I’m taking is math. I have a 100 in that class currently due to our focus for the last half of the semester being finance and I’m good with math that applies to real things, but everything before that (which I’ll also be tested on) is shit I really couldn’t grasp very well. so there’s definitely reason to study, right? 

not to me. 

I can’t find a single shred of motivation to even care about my exams, let alone the effort of studying beforehand. it’s really stressing me out even more but I can’t even bring myself to climb the stairs. it even took me like 3 hours to even get out of bed this morning, which ended up starving my dog of his breakfast, which he didn’t deserve. 

I don’t know what to do to break this and I don’t understand why my meds aren’t doing their job. any thoughts or maybe advice?

TL;DR - I have no motivation to care about my exams despite being on a medication that’s supposed to motivate me.",21May2019,1
187,"I .. don’t know how to keep friends. I see in black and white. One assholish things makes someone a bad person to me, and if I am friends with bad people that makes me bad too. But I think I am missing the part where these people are human and make mistakes like I do. But I’m not a hypocrite, I choose not to forgive myself as well. That’s another one of my issues. 

I guess I’m venting as well as asking for advice.

When you feel an urge to do something, how do you make yourself NOT go through with it? I block people and come back and say sorry only to do it again. But it makes perfect sense to me why I’m doing it. I explain this in great detail sometimes, which I guess makes me look even more unstable. I overshare. 

I feel like I have no hope of getting better because there is really nothing wrong with me.. I just do things because my brain makes me think I need to or I am a bad person. There also aren’t a lot of great psychiatrists who take my insurance.

I am kinda diagnosed OCD (no solid documentation but told I should take medication for the issue of it specifically by a psychiatrist) and I have a generalized anxiety disorder.

I think working out and eating right would help. I’ve had a small piece of fish today, and it’s almost 8pm. I just don’t know how to start.

When you felt like you were falling down a hole of uncertainty and poor mental health.. how did you help yourself? I feel like there is no hope for me.",21May2019,1
188,"I thought I just hated one specific person but I hate all of them. I had like 6 psychiatrists and I hated all of them, I hated all the nurses, I hated all my therapists. I don’t know why but I feel like I can’t articulate myself in front of them and don’t feel heard. Especially after I have a manic episode or a psychosis, my brain feels fried and can’t really tell them what happened, then they ignore me. Is it just me?",21May2019,1
