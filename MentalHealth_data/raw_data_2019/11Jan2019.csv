0,"Just over 2 months ago, I hit rock bottom and tried to take my own life. Things on the outside (or to the outside)  are looking up but I'm plagued with thoughts every day about how I got to that point in my life. I'm looking back at every point in my life and how it led to that decision. I cant sleep, I can barely think about anything else. My anxiety is horrendous at the minute I'm not leaving the house I'm not showering,  I'm cancelling appointments. I dont really know what the reasoning for this post is, I just think I need to publish how I am right now. ",11Jan2019,1
1,"I usually hate having to put on a fake persona but you know, looks like i'll have to. Well, i heard the truth from my mum a few days ago - It's your fault no one likes you cause you're depressed all the time. And you know what? I agree. No one wants to hang out around a depressed person. I'd originally (and stupidly) thought that i don't have to put on a fake happy mask for anyone. Yeah, that ended up great. Now i have no friends.  


When the school starts again, im gonna try my best to just smile and laugh along with others. Even if it hurts on the inside. Cause no one wants to see that shit. I just hope people will even consider hanging out with me after i was a depressed shit for months. And I hope i learn to act soon, cause im not the best at faking emotions.   


I guess i just needed to vent because it hurts when you realise your life is shit because of yourself.. but i'm gonna try my best to turn things around this year. I've decided my new years resolution is to become a likeable person. I'll be less depressed when i actually have friends. ",11Jan2019,1
2,"I suffer from anxiety. I always have, I've had it my entire life. Sometimes it goes through phases of getting worse.

Lately I've been having this fear about losing my parents. I'm 25 and independent but they're honestly my biggest support system and closest people in my life. I don't know what to do.

4,"**preface, also sorry for shitty mobile formatting:** My mom and I generally have a good relationship, though we fight sometimes. Nothing bad or abusive emotionally or physically, but it’s like today she snapped. Also, I have several medically diagnosed mental illnesses (depression, adhd, ocd, bulimia, binge eating disorder, bdd, and social anxiety) I am getting treated for most if not all of these at the moment and my mom is very supportive, but I don’t know what to tell her now.

I have a habit of falling asleep as soon as I get home from school, along with having very little energy even with a sufficient amount of sleep throughout the day. I’m not a cranky or irritable person, so it’s not a case of that. When I wake up, according to my mom I start talking gibberish, or just about random general topics, like today was apparently about horses, which I cannot recall. So to start off, my mom says that I started arguing with her about taking my contacts out (sometimes I accidentally fall asleep with them on mid day, but always take them out at night.) I cannot recall ANYTHING happening, as I just remember waking up to my mom yelling that she was done. I didn’t know what I did and she said “you know what you did” or something along the lines of that. She proceeds to tell me that she is no buying me any more contacts because I can’t be responsible enough to take them out (I cannot stand being seen without contacts in. Woo social anxiety &amp; bdd.) Then my grandma decides to chime in and say that I am the most disobedient child that she has ever seen. I don’t reply to this because she has been in and out of the hospital, so I don’t want to hurt her by making her yell. So I try to explain to my mom that after I wake up, I literally cannot remember anything that I say or do, and cannot control that behavior. She and I then argue for 10 minutes about me not apologizing for something that I cannot help. She compared this to her example: I trip somebody and say “oops, sorry. I wasn’t fully awake.” In my opinion that is not a fair comparison. One person has no clue what they have done or said until somebody tells them, and the other person has to be aware of themselves tripping another person. I’m rambling, but I’m freaking out. My family is falling apart, and a few times my mom has told me that I am ripping the family apart (if I am, I’m not the sole cause. My brother has low functioning autism and diabetes, which adds to the family stress. I just want help. I don’t see my two therapists until next month.

**TL;DR: Mom not accepting me not apologizing for something I did not consciously do. I don’t recall anything that happened. Family being torn apart. Called “disobedient” for arguing in my barely awake state of mind. Also kudos if you actually read all of that, I’m terrible at formatting events in chronological order.",11Jan2019,1
5,"Seriously, what's the point? I'm doing well in school, I have friends, I have a girlfriend, I'm doing alright. That being said everything around me feels so fake and meaningless. People's emotions don't matter, humor doesn't matter. It all just happens but it feels so weird, like all the people around me have some extra dimension of personality I just don't have. I have no sense of humor, that being said I can understand humor, make jokes and seem funny, but I've never laughed, I want to know what it's like. I have friends and a girlfriend but at the end of the day I get the same enjoyment out of sitting in my house all day as I do hanging out with friends. I crashed my car, it doesn't matter to me, I don't care. I had to pay a lot of money I'm going to have to get a job but frankly I just don't care. Basically all I do all day is just meditate, I sit in my chair or lay on my bed after school for hours just trying my best to just be totally absorbed in the things around me, and it's pleasant. Everything else just doesn't matter. That being said, I want to know what it's like to enjoy a sport, or enjoy someone's company, or have a passion. It doesn't frustrate or sadden me, it's who I am, but I want to know what it's like. That being said, I do have some emotion, I feel empathy for people, especially when a bad situation could have been easily avoided. Will I ever be able to feel emotions such as happiness or pleasure or sadness? I want to know what's it like, I used to feel them when I was young my recollection is blurry because the memories are so old. I do not believe there is anything wrong with me, however I do wonder is there anything I can do to experience emotions like a normal person would?",11Jan2019,1

9,"Like I said in the title, I feel like I'm moderately affected by a lot of mental health issues. I've never felt normal, my interactions with people have never felt normal. It always feels off, like there's a level of falseness to it. Most of the time I feel no emotion towards anything really but I have a tendency to get extremely upset over a tiny thing, break something, then immediately go back to calm again. I've had mood swings for no reason where I've held a bunch of pills in my hand, but I was too scared I would mess it up, yet most of the time I feel fine, calm. When I interact with people they always say I seem normal or I'll clearly be able to tell they like my personality, but I feel like the interaction is awkward and it feels unnatural to me. I occasionally have memory issues where I remember doing something quite vividly, like texting my girlfriend or moving my car keys, but then I find out I actually didn't do what I thought I did. Also, I've had problems where a familiar place felt totally unfamiliar to me, like I was in a new place but I had a map and I studied the layout. Also, I've had times in school where I would raise my hand to answer a question and when the teacher said my name (normally not an issue whatsoever) for some reason I just filled with fear, I would just start crying and end up having to leave the room. I also used to feel like other people could listen into my thoughts, and I would get a little bit scared and I'd start thinking thoughts to try to talk to them, or just to tell them I know they're listening and the thoughts I'm thinking are to mess with them, that mostly went away about 2 or 3 months ago though (I'm 16 btw). None of the problems specifically cause me too much distress in my day to day life, I could easily live with any of them, but the combination of everything worries me that it could be something serious.

14,"Hello! I have recently learned that in my province  (Ontario Canada) there is a psychiatric hospital called Waypoint Centre. I was wondering if anyone had any experience with this place and what it’s like staying there. My friend is currently admitted and I’m really worried about them. I stayed in a psych ward at a general hospital once and it was a nightmare. Their 72 hours are almost upC but the doctor said that the options at this point are immediate discharge, add 72 hours (they’re a transfer from a general hospital), or add 14 days. I don’t think they need the 14 days I think they’re safe now and they had a crisis worker evaluate them saying they were safe to go home. The only thing stopping them is the doctor signing off on it. At this point they feel like they don’t need to be there and myself and their parents believe they are okay to go home. I was wondering how strict Waypoint is with the form 1 renewal or upgrade to form 3? They’re not violent and don’t want to hurt themselves anymore and have the loose ends of a safety plan started.

Lately I have been having these episodes where it feels like my brain (or I guess in further context, the negative side of it) takes full control...

By that I mean; I’ll be doing completely fine, then all of a sudden I’m flooded with thoughts of hopelessness, depression, despair, and more recently... suicide. To sum up what the state is like; I lose all interest in life as a whole, and for some reason see suicide as the only way out. While these thoughts are flooding me, I can’t seem to do anything- almost as if I’m not in control..? I know some great coping mechanisms to try to “calm me down” but it’s as if the idea of calming down is unrealistic when it’s all happening. Basically, my mind takes control for a certain amount of time and then randomly, the thoughts leave.. and I’m in a good mood again.

Does anyone know what this may be due to? Is there some sort of disorder this could be?

26,"I never realized that this was even a thing for me, but lately I have noticed how much it actually is and has been  affecting me.

I used to share my room with my older sister. She has her own issues that I won't get into, but one of them was that she would get up from her bed at night to hit me in my face while I'm sleeping if I breath too loudly. She did that so regularly that it created this weird complex in my brain. And I didn't tell anyone because I was just super irritated and sleepy when she did that and my parents were still asleep.

Growing up, I would always avoid getting out of breath when people are around, so I loved cycling, rollerscating, swimming in big bodies of water or hiking by myself, but I hated PE, any group activity or going to the gym. I never have both headphones in if I'm somewhere where people could potentially hear me breathing, one is always out to keep my breath under control. The only time I can breath the way I need to in front of someone is during sex, really.

This has always caused me to be out of breath easily because I keep my breath frequency and intensity lower than I'd need it to be. I'm excellent at keeping my breath under water which is a plus, I guess, but it's not really a great swap against the constant paranoia that someone could notice me breathing.

The thing is that I want this to stop, but I find it immensely difficult. I was wondering, maybe someone else here has experienced something similar and could give me some advice? It would be very welcome.

My son is 7 years old. He is a sensitive, compassionate, kind kid and I really do not think he was just trying to avoid bed time but he said something that shook me. As I put him to bed he said ""daddy, I don't think I can sleep. I keep hearing the voice in my head"".  I asked him what the voice said and he said that he knew it was in his head and it didn't say anything he could understand but it was so loud.

The instant he said that I knew exactly what voice he meant. I heard it too, from the age of 6 to my mid twenties I would hear a unintelligible yelling in my own head. It was worse when the house was quiet but it was always there. It is hard to explain but the best I can do is to ask you to imagine a very large angry man shouting at the top of his voice through a very thin pillow. The words are indistinguishable but the tone is rage. I don't know how to describe it better than that. The only other analogy I can come up with is sitting in a room with someone shouting through the window at you: you can't understand what they are saying but you can tell from the tone that they are angry.

I knew (and my son knew) that the voice was not real. The voice never told me to do anything, it never even said words that could be understood. Something about it makes it clear that the voice is inside my head. Has anyone else experienced a hallucination like this? 

I managed to grow out of hearing the voice but I have had other mental health issues as well. My only hope is to figure out if my son inherited my issues or if this is a common experience in boys his age.

33,"Hey all. Throwaway account here, hoping for advice.

I am a 29 years old. I've struggled with anxiety since a traumatic experience when I was a child. I have allowed it to dictate my life and for the most part kill my potential. I dropped out of college when I was 19 because I could not do it. There were so many people and so much pressure and I could not handle it. I dropped out and moved to a new state where I started delivering for Dominoes. The Dominoes job was a blessing and a curse. My anxiety is such that when I have a stable job surrounded by people I know, I can be fine and healthy. Sure when a new hire came around I would slam my walls back up, but gradually they'd lower, and I could cope with such small changes. So my life was going no where, but at least I was supporting myself and was for the most part, happy.

That went on for a few years. My younger brother graduated college, my parents were pursuing new things, and I was still doing a job that a monkey could be trained to do. Eventually, my glorious state legalized cannabis. I had used the stuff a few times, but had never really gotten into it. Alcohol was always my drug of choice. Over time, I started using cannabis (in the form of edibles) and really started to enjoy them. But what was more amazing, was that after a night of taking a few edibles I would notice that I was damn near immune to the anxiety the following day.

That was huge. With some pressure from my brother and my own new found willingness to give my nightmare (college) another try, I enrolled. And honestly, it was great. With weed keeping my anxiety down I could actually focus on school. I kept that up for a couple years.  I am 2 semesters off graduating and my GPA is higher than it has ever been.

Of course, anybody who has used weed (or most drugs) knows that tolerance is a bitch. I won't go over my entire tolerance timeline, but I will give the start and end point. My first time taking an edible was 5mg THC and it fucked me up for a few hours. Last night I took 150mg of THC. 

Now, the anxiety is not kept at bay. In fact it bites harder than ever. For the last month or so, my stomach has dropped 50+ times a day. I almost always wake up before my alarm so that my body can express its anxiety and ruin my sleep. Thinking about anything remotely stressful seems to trigger me 3 times harder. I don't get hungry and tired anymore on my own, because weed has taken over as the play caller. My secret weapon (thc), which resulted in the best 2 years of my life, is now a liability.

So when my current vial of oil runs out in a couple days, I will stop. And frankly, I am terrified. I am terrified to see how it will affect my grades, I am terrified to spend all night staring at the ceiling, I am terrified to feeling starving one minute and nauseous the next. I am terrified because anxiety has ran almost my entire life, and I am giving it the reins again.",11Jan2019,1

35,"I've been seeing my PCP for panic attacks and general pain (which is caused by a combination of scoliosis and anxiety). The scoliosis causes pain in my back, left shoulder, left arm, and chest, which sets off my anxiety. The location of the pain itself always makes me think of a heart attack, and the anxiety symptoms that follow (paired with and amplifying the scoliosis pain) make that fear feel much more real, which often sends me into a panic attack. It's an awful combination.

 I've been cleared as healthy, I know I'm healthy in my logical, conscious mind, but my lizard brain is much harder to convince. The panic attacks and patterns of irrational thinking and fear happen anyway, and I feel helpless. Today my PCP asked me if I'd be open to the idea of cognitive behavioral therapy. I enthusiastically said I would love it, but then remembered it's out of the question for me. I explained to him that I am a pre-dental student who is in school too much to work, so I do not have the means to seek treatment on my own. All treatment I receive is through my parents, and they don't want me to receive CBT.

The first time I mentioned CBT to them, my father said that's for schizophrenics and crazy people, and my mother said she doesn't want anyone ""brainwashing"" me. My mother would rather I take herbal supplements (unregulated by the FDA, I refuse them because I do not trust them) or talk to a church official for ""Christian counseling"" (basically to pray the anxiety away). Now please, don't go bashing my parents, that isn't what I'm here for. But for some reason, they attach some stigma to CBT and dismiss it as a treatment option.

How can I present CBT to them as a safe, reliable, effective, and perfectly normal treatment option? I really want treatment, I really want to get better. Would it be okay to ask my PCP to advocate for CBT on my behalf? School is only going to get harder and harder, I want to be able to manage this before it gets too bad.",11Jan2019,1

  I am a 19 year old girl, and I think I have what might be a little bit of a stalking problem. I have never caused harm to anyone, or broken the law, but sometimes I feel close. It starts with repeated, intrusive thoughts about one person. This person can be anyone. Thankfully, a lot of times it's a famous person who I can only have contact with via social media. But sometimes it happens with people that are involved in my life, and when it does, it's much scarier. The thoughts turn into trying to ask them personal questions whilst trying to not scare them off. I will follow said person everywhere I can; I will talk to their friends, follow them on social media...And sometimes I will obsess on their social media for hours. When it's at it's worst, I will use any means I can find to find the people that are closest to them. Not as in showing up to their homes or anything, usually just trying to get as much information as possible without breaking the law. But I will waste hours and hours in my life doing this. Sometimes, it's all I can think about. If i do manage to find something that upsets me, i.e this person has a girlfriend/boyfriend/etc, instead of going away it just makes my obsession worse and bitter.Suddenly the thought of what said person would think about me controls my whole life and emotions.

39,"My diagnoses: CPTSD, bipolar 1, depression (symptom, not MDD), anxiety, akathisia (debilitating movement disorder caused by an antipsychotic I was prescribed), ADHD, formerly suffered from Bulimia (now EDNOS), substance abuse. I have been institutionalized in psychiatric facilities many times, did outpatient rehab for 2 years as a teenager, I was sexually assaulted twice as a young teen, and I was last hospitalized in October of 2018 for suicidal ideations and psychosis, as documented by my local E.R. 

I suffered from PTSD after many years of physical, mental, emotional, verbal, and financial abuse at the hands of my father. The last straw that broke the camel’s back was when I was diagnosed with Complex PTSD after my first boyfriend committed suicide by firearm on January 27th, 2015. I was never the same after that. I am a different person now. 

There is an alarm bell going off in my head, and it won’t stop. It never stops. That is the reality of living with Complex Trauma. 

My current situation is that I am dealing with the loss of my grandmother who passed away last August, and then I was physically assaulted by my father the same night she died. I realize this is a delayed response to my loss, however I deal with bereavement in a very strange way after losing my boyfriend, and I also lost an uncle from suicide by firearm the previous year. What sets him apart is that like me, he also dealt with PTSD but instead it was because he was a sharp shooter in Vietnam. Like me he also was bipolar and suffered from addiction, specifically alcoholism. I never was the kind of person to use drugs, but I have been using hard substances since the beginning of October. I feel as though the suicide of my Uncle Don set a precedent for what my future may look like. I am holding on for dear life, and taking it one day at a time. I refuse to let my illness swallow me whole. 

I am just feeling very haunted right now. Absolutely haunted. When I found out my grandmother was slipping away, my family and I drove over 2,000 miles from the west coast to Rochester, New York so we could be there for her final moments. The drive was tense and nerve wracking, because we were unsure if we would make it there in time. We completed our drive in about 3 days, and when we got there, she was still alive, but barely. 

I walked into my grandparent’s living room, and she laid in a hospital bed. Her lungs had filled with fluid, and she had the death rattle in her chest. It was such a loud, jarring noise. I am still haunted by the sound. 

I grabbed her hand and leaned in close to her. I said, “Grandma, it’s Mary Margaret.” Her eyes were closed and her chest was rattling very loud. I do not remember what I said next. I do realize this may be a sign of a mental breakdown. However, I do remember that I said exactly what I needed to say, and I find peace in that. After I said it, she raised her eyebrows and furrowed them together. She opened her mouth very wide but could not speak. 

What did she mean to say? I want to know what she said. When I see her in my dreams I ask her, but I haven’t gotten an answer yet. 

I was taking turns with my cousins holding her hand, and when my turn was up, I went outside and broke down in hysterics. It was extremely hard for me to keep my composure when I was holding my grandmother’s hand, but I did. I didn’t want her to be sad or afraid. 

About 30 minutes passed and it was my turn again to hold my grandmother’s hand. When I came back in I realized that she had an accident in her bed, and I called my mother in to clean her up (she is an Registered Nurse and used to work in an elderly home). She gave her fresh bedding and a gown, fluffed her pillow and put lotion on her arms and legs. I knew the end was near. 

I sat with her and held her hand. I wanted to talk to her but I was lost for words. I wonder if she could feel me holding her hand. I wanted her to know I was there. I had to use the bathroom which was only the next room over, so I walked away and took about two minutes to do that. Her chest was still rattling, even louder now. 

When I returned to my grandmother, the air was so thick, it could be sliced with a butterknife. I had a very odd feeling, it was very strange. 

The room was completely silent. 

I approached my grandmother and touched her wrist. 

She was gone. 

I imagine her choking and reaching for me. But I wasn’t there. She suffocated and died alone. This weighs on me heavily to this day.

I went outside to break the news to my family who were all seated at the picnic table. Everyone gasped, cried, and scattered, some of them tried to head into the house to pay their final respects. They were stopped by my father, who is my grandmother’s eldest child and also the primary abuser in my household. He told everyone to get lost, and that only my grandmother’s children were welcome to pay their final respects. I was heartbroken. My cousins and my brother and I walked over to the pond. We sat there and sobbed. I felt so empty and lost. Not only was I lost, I felt as though I lost something very dear to me. I still feel like that, even in this moment. We sat at the pond with teary eyes and gazed emptily over the water. After sitting there for about a half hour, we collected ourselves and headed to the bar. We got drunk, barely ate the food we ordered, and we didn’t have a lot to say to each other. We headed back to my grandparents house after dark. 

I am still traumatized by this next event so I will try to keep this short and simple. After getting back and walking up the patio, I saw my mother, father and aunt were all seated at the table. My aunt seemed sober but my parents were absolutely fucking plastered. I realized in all the commotion before leaving, I had misplaced my phone. I asked my mother to call it. I heard it ringing in the house and I went inside to grab it. 

I answered my phone to tell my mom I had found it. In the background I heard my father talking to my aunt. He said, “She is completely fucking brain dead.” My father often likes to tell people how stupid I am, although I consider myself to be at least semi intelligent. I was seething with rage. Hatred boiled up inside of me and it began to overflow. I hung up the phone and stormed out of the house. 

I walked out onto the patio to confront my father. This is something I never do. 

I said, “What are you doing, talking shit about me?” I was very angry. I do not recall what he said next, but he was very angry too. He stood up and came at me. My mother, who is complicit in the abuse, went inside as my aunt watched the ordeal. He grabbed me by the arms and dragged me down the patio towards the driveway. 

“You need to leave,” he snarled, “get the fuck out. Nobody wants you here.” I told him to let go of me but he didn’t. I had bruises on my arms the next day, which I photographed. I included this assault in the police report I filed against him a month later for domestic violence. He said, “You do realize my mother just died today?” I told him that my grandmother died today as well. I told him to let go of me. Things were about to go from bad to worse. But then my aunt quickly stood up and started walking towards us. My father let go of me and walked away. 

After that happened I had a great discussion with my aunt about the abuse I was putting up with. To this day, she my only family member to acknowledge that I am being abused. Next I tried talking to my mother about it. I repeatedly told her that she was complicit and that it needs to end. She said that I provoked him. I take it that she was implying that I deserved it. She was far too drunk for me to reason with, so I dropped the subject and went to bed. 

I am still living under my parent’s roof and the things I have dealt with have consumed me and taken over my life. I have no job, no money, no car, no driver’s license, no friends, and nowhere to go to escape. I rarely leave my room, and I rarely leave my house. This is due in part to the fact that there was a false imprisonment scenario many years ago, where I was being held against my will by my father and forbidden to leave my home. I spent many years in isolation completely cut off from the outside world. I have become quiet and reclusive because of this. My father has not assaulted me since that day, which may be because he is aware that I now own pepper spray. Because he cannot physically abuse me, he has escalated every other form of abuse. I am so torn up inside. I don’t even have anyone to talk to right now, so I am reaching out to all of you on here, 

TLDR: what are some good ways to overcome great feelings of loss in addition to being assaulted by my father the same day my grandmother died?

To those that read this, thank you and my heart goes out to all of you who are also struggling. Much love to all of you and take care of yourselves, because you are worth it.

Even seeing it in real words in real life is mindblowing to me right now. But I’m not sure what to do next. The first person I talked to about it really was my son’s mother who was understanding and offered a lot of help. But the conversation went south, maybe my fault I’m not sure, and I reverted back to just isolating myself and not letting her help. Over such a silly thing really. Most of my friends and family are what I’d describe as toxic. I barely scrape by as it is and I am having a hard time figuring out what I’m supposed to be doing and how to deal with everything. Over the summer I got “triggered” by something and ended up with 20 Xanax bars in my belly on my way to a bar to just hopefully not have to deal with it anymore which somehow ended up with me commuitting myself and being diagnosed with some kind of mega depression word. I was doing okay for a while. But now that I’m actually confronting things I’m lost and I don’t even know what my next move is.

50,"First post on Reddit so here we go...

I've been with my boyfriend for what will be a decade this year. We met when we were 17 and 18, and shortly after we met he told me he suffered from Tourrette's Syndrome, ADHD, and OCD which didn't bother me at all. I thought it made him special because he had become such a strong and amazing person despite his adversity, if anything it made me love him more.

Since then, we've overcome a long distance relationship, the death of his father, the murder of my uncle, losing my aunt to cancer, etc but at least we had eachother. Then, a little over a year ago I got a call when I was out of town that my boyfriend had attempted suicide. Once he was hospitalized, he was diagnosed with Bipolar I and PTSD, and that's when everything changed.

We've been struggling for over a year to find him adequate therapy, the right medication, and support. At the time of his first depressive episode he had just lost his job, was uninsured, and to this day I struggle to support us financially and emotionally.

With every episode, it feels like he is slipping further and further away. Away from the person he was, from the life we've made and worse, from the future we've worked so hard to build.

This last month it seems like everything has come to a head. We've suffered through some of the worst episodes he's ever had, and I don't know how much more I can take. His disease makes him numb, disconnected, cruel, violent, delusional, and reckless, but when he comes out of it he's so regretful and remorseful and it's absolutely devestating to watch him go through it. I can't imagine the pain and suffering he's going through, but I'm also hurting so deeply and it's ruining our relationship. 

I'm trying my best not to feel resentment or anger at the thought that he is being taken away from me by his illness. I want to marry this person, have children, and grow old together. I love him so much, but sometimes question if I have the strength to stay.

61,"Since I have been a small child I have always been very hyperactive and could never focus on anything. I was a naturally bright child so it never occurred to my parents to get me checked for anything as my grades were excellent and the stigma around ADHD kids being ‘dumb’ made them sure I did not have it. I was always getting in trouble in class and sometimes leading other kids astray too. It is not until recent years where this has affected my studies and my relationship with people as I am considered ‘annoying’ by people who don’t know me well and even more annoying by those who do. I am a very out going person and when meeting people i get excited and want to become friends. I’m always the last one up on sleepovers (i get on average 4 hours of sleep a night) and it drives my friends crazy. For these reasons above I have made up to my friends that I am taking ADHD medication and they question why it doesn’t work sometimes but other times it ‘works too well’ to quote a friend of mine. I’m either bouncing off walls or i am deep inside my own head trying to keep these negative thoughts at bay. I don’t know if the group I have surrounded myself with are toxic or I am delusional but i always see things other persons don’t see in people.

any help is greatly appreciated! ",11Jan2019,1
63,"Recently I’ve noticed that I wake up and feel extremely tired and exhausted both mentally and physically even though I will go to bed at around 9 or 10 and wake up at 6 am. While I’m in bed I notice a lot of tossing and turning and sleeping/not being awake for moments and then suddenly waking up. I’m wondering if this has any ties to an addiction withdraw as I’m in my second week without masturbation or porn. I try not to stimulate my brain by playing video games or texting before bed but I do watch Brooklyn 99 on my MacBook with the lights turned low and the screen turned on night mode. Does anyone know what my problem is? The only way I seem to be able to stay awake and alert throughout the day is by drinking coffee(which I don’t want to do). I’m a 16 year old boy if that helps at all.
Thanks",11Jan2019,1
64,"Not necessarily bad dreams, just strange. I’m just standing there. 

Long story short, I lived with my parents as a young adult, and they were abusive. Asking my parents if we could do X or making a suggestion was largely misinterpreted as:

“Don’t tell me what to do!”

Trying to tell my parents that there is a large difference between asking someone to do X and demanding they do it, was basically futile.

Basically the long story short is, the living conditions of the house increasingly got worse, my parents disregarded the health of themselves and myself, and their hoarding got worse. Basically they hoarded animals inside the house, and in addition to becoming more dirty/dusty, the house seemed to have a never-ending rank smell. 

Attempts to help my parents wee futile. I was threatened with eviction held over my head many times, my step-dad threatened to physically punch me because I politely asked a question about the conditions of the house. 

My mom actively denied reality and claimed it ‘wasn’t that bad’ or what have you, I printed off articles from the CDC *specially* warning people not to put X animals in the house. She refused to read them.

When I lived there, I wrestled with the idea of calling social services, but pondered where I would go after, and the fallout it would entail. 

I’ve since moved out but that house ought to be demolished or evicted. Writing all this makes me upset to basically relive the memories. One sibling was even ignorant enough to tell me it was ‘my fault’ I was being abused in that household because I didn’t move out soon enough.

Help me overcome these stressful memories... I feel like calling social services.

As usual, I go for something way beyond beginner level, so basically setting myself up to fail.

A pure rage came over me and I saw red, smashed the thing to pieces with the hammer, and now there's nails and wood all over my room and I fucking hate myself. Why do I do this to myself?

66,"It is day 23 coming in to see my sick grandma now. She is now in the intensive care unit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why is it socially acceptable to shame people for wanting to vent about this on Facebook?

&amp;#x200B;

When she goes, she said DNR - do not resuscitate. 

&amp;#x200B;

She has no power of attorney. 

She just has word of mouth of what she wants done if she goes.

She has no insurance on her stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

It is 4 a.m. 

I can't count how many nights I've stayed here.

She's my last living grandparent. I've lost two. I've lost two foster grandparents, too. I never met the one who abused this one.

&amp;#x200B;

It's now 5 a.m.

&amp;#x200B;

Took a break to keep her company while they did more bloodwork, checked her blood pressure, and sugar level. She has diabetes, heart problems, and high blood pressure, among many other things that has happened over the past couple of months as to why she is here and shit keeps happening, extending her stay.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My 17 year old sister told me that she hates me

As if I never do anything around the house or for her

Told me that taking care of grandma is not a real job and to get a real job

Even though I get and earned EI and she doesn't even understand what that is

She told me the only reason i am back home is because I have nowhere else to go

&amp;#x200B;

What a fucking privileged little shit 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes. I am thirty 

&amp;#x200B;

I am half vietnamese half native

My dad is a Vietnam war refugee

My grandma is a residential school survivor

&amp;#x200B;

The ripple effects intergenerational trauma is very real in my family

&amp;#x200B;

I was raised in a household with two pedophiles in my family. One on each side of my family

&amp;#x200B;

When somebody was watching me change, I wouldn't know if it was my dad, or my native grandma's partner

&amp;#x200B;

When I tried speaking up about my grandmas partner touching my little sister, nobody believed me

&amp;#x200B;

When my dad did that thing to my mom's little sister for several years, from the age of 11-13, everyone shunned my \*aunty.\*

&amp;#x200B;

When i told my dad to stop speaking vietnamese to me and i wanted nothing to do with the language or culture because of what he did to her, my whole family and i are now outcasts for not being able to speak the language. It haunts me every time some asshole asks and judges, ""why don't you guys speak vietnamese? Your dad should have taught you""

&amp;#x200B;

Years later, in my adult years, I tried going back to Vietnam to regain my language, culture, and family ties. I wanted to give back to my community by teaching english. I couldn't find work. Even though I told english speaking cousins to tell everyone for 1.5 years of my plans, I was barely welcomed. People didnt understand or care or try understand my poor accent as to why i was there. My dad's relatives (my aunts and uncles, cousins, and cousin's kids) shunned me, locked me in my room, locked me away from washroom access forcing me to piss in a bag in my own bedroom. 

&amp;#x200B;

I went to a hotel to take a break from the bullshit where I was drugged and raped by two hotel workers. I dealt with the canadian consulate and corrupt cops who laughed in my face. Again, even western family shunned me when I needed them most.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I hate being associated with negative stereotypes, including being a so called drunk indian or dumb asian.

&amp;#x200B;

People I just met will start being racist/prejudice, ""all women, all natives, all asians, all teenagers, all people with tattoos, all ""fat"" people, all ""mental health people, etc............. except you,"" I always hear when they realize that I AM THAT MINORITY. ALL OF THEM.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Even before the Vietnam incident, so at the age of 21, I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, ptsd, sleep problems, personality disorder,  and whatever else.  What fucking luck do I have in this world?

&amp;#x200B;

I used to work several jobs simultaneously,  get good grades, graduated,  got two college certificates in Indigenous Family Support work and indigenous Human Services. 

&amp;#x200B;

I used to teach, do homecare, be a receptionist, manager, cook, cashier, delivery driver, support worker, Indigenous English as a Second Dialect Support Worker, Insigenous Support Worker, tutor, be a caregiver,  a nanny, a makeup artist, an alternative model, a camgirl,... I started working at the age of 10 with my dad on the beach. I dug clams, picked oysters, picked salal 

&amp;#x200B;

I earned my shit 

How dare she

&amp;#x200B;

And just because my mental health has declined because of

Bully bosses

Car accidents

Rapes

Sexual assaults

My husband father sexually assaultning me in my sleep who is a person of power

Shit landlords

Shit roommates

3 relatives and 2 friends dying in 2016, the same year all those celebrities passed away - bowie, Chyna, lemmy, and so on

&amp;#x200B;

Seeing my grandma die in front of me at a young age. Just like this time again. Diabetes. Even though i was a child, I was the one who called 911 and the paramedics brought her back. My family, my mom already gave up on her and went to go get fast food instead. She almost died again because of diabetes, meds, she had a fall, confusion with meds, lost 22 pounds in about three weeks, and the list goes on.

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck her for saying that taking care of my grandma is not a real job

Just because i dont want my other sister to use me by getting me to do the bitch work at her studio by doing lashes

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be a tattooer

I have lost myself

I have lost joy

&amp;#x200B;

What brings me life is my grandma

&amp;#x200B;

She has taught me to be strong

The fact that she went to residential school 

&amp;#x200B;

She got strapped and bullied and whatever else. Kept away from her dying grandma. Stripped from her small family, language, culture. We have no language or culture either on that side either because of this

&amp;#x200B;

Colonization

&amp;#x200B;

I am more than a fucking loser

And I rarely tell myself that

I just dont understand

And always feel like

why me

What now

&amp;#x200B;

You think you hit rock bottom and it goes on

&amp;#x200B;

My husband and I were in $80,000 in debt. $20,000 alone just by dealing with Vietnam, thousands of dollars in counselling, medical, and self care. We didnt touch our banking cards since December 15, and in interest alone, owed $1000.

&amp;#x200B;

How in the fuck is anybody supposed to make it? By keeping their mouths shut

&amp;#x200B;

I haven'tseen a counselor in a month and waiting another month for my new one because of money, moving, and helping grandma

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Last year

I missed  a shit ton of work because my husbands father got cancer

&amp;#x200B;

And the day of surgery, after waiting all day and him fasting for two, at 5 pm, they had go reachedule hos surgery.

&amp;#x200B;

We already rescheduled our trip, hotels, work, and so on just to be there for him. Even though he did that to me. I set aside my differences 

&amp;#x200B;

So we went on our trip

&amp;#x200B;

He had surgery

He went straight from the airport to his moms hotel then his dads hospital room anand missed more work

&amp;#x200B;

He supposedly was supposed to take 5days to heal, he took 17 days

&amp;#x200B;

17 days of dealing with both of his shitty toxic parents.

&amp;#x200B;

His mom was and is a horrible alcoholic

&amp;#x200B;

Okay

She has a horrible alcohol addiction to be PC

&amp;#x200B;

And so she would literally drink and wake up all hours of the night and slam the hotel doors just to get up and check to see if he was still sleeping, in and out. Fucjing drinking beers in a coffee mug starting at least at 5 a.m.  as if we wouldn't know.

&amp;#x200B;

When Vietnam happened and I told her, the first thing she said was ""get over it. We all get raped.""

&amp;#x200B;

Last year when I admitted ""on Facebook "" and had my rants, that o was suicidal, and I had a hard time admitting to my husbands family about being suicidal, she started drunk ranting about her dad

&amp;#x200B;

My husband is also half native half Irish with a clusterfuck of mental health, addictions, and so on in his family 

&amp;#x200B;

His first memory is of his 16 year old brother shooting himself in the head when he was 3.

&amp;#x200B;

The year we started dating, 2006, just before that, his other brother died drinking and driving

&amp;#x200B;

One day my husband drew something for me. He always draws. He is an artist...

&amp;#x200B;

He drew something that looked like a hand and a scrunched up paper bag...

&amp;#x200B;

He was upset as if I should have realized that it was his brothers nloody hand, grabbing his moms shirt after his cad slammed into the pole and his body flung from his car. That's his last living memory of that brother who I also never met.

&amp;#x200B;

He was in the military for 6.5 years. And only recently, he finally admitted some of the shit he held in and saw. He hides some of it because hes trying to protect me

&amp;#x200B;

He hides some of it because his dad used to beat the shit out of him if he cried for not being a ""real man""

&amp;#x200B;

His dad went to residential school and so did several others in his family. His dad is homophobic and i dont doubt it's because of residential school 

&amp;#x200B;

One of his uncles has his tongue cut out from being in residential school 

&amp;#x200B;

I can go on and on and on

&amp;#x200B;

.

&amp;#x200B;

I try empathize , understand, and forgive, but it's too much to hold in

&amp;#x200B;

I'm tired of these secrets

&amp;#x200B;

I think that's why people get sick

Cancer

Mental health, obviously

Addictions, obviously

Etc

&amp;#x200B;

These seem obvious to me, but my family, his family is in denial 

&amp;#x200B;

Ugh

&amp;#x200B;

Just

Let

Me

Go

&amp;#x200B;

I've brought myself in to the hospital to admit I was suicidal twice in the last year.

That's it

&amp;#x200B;

And if I kept quiet, nobody would have any idea why

&amp;#x200B;

And I usually do

Bite my tongue.

the quiet observer

The peace keeper

&amp;#x200B;

But i am exhausted

&amp;#x200B;

I am tired of staying strong

And my husband is finally getting professional help

&amp;#x200B;

But its bullshit

I know theres bullshit about keeping professional life and relationships separate

&amp;#x200B;

But that'z bullshit

&amp;#x200B;

Anybody should empathize and understand when family is sick and fucking dying

&amp;#x200B;

I dont understand such privileged little shits like my sister. Same parents. Just a weird shit geneation/age gap

&amp;#x200B;

It scares me

The future 

It's why I never wanted kids

&amp;#x200B;

But colonialism/colonization wont win

It wont ""kill the indian inside us""

&amp;#x200B;

I want my shit straightened before having kids

&amp;#x200B;

I am excited to try help build a better future by teaching right from wrong

Respect

Empathy

Understanding 

Love

To give

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

This can be seen as weakness

But i dont give a fuck

67,"Recently I've been having overwhelming, paralyzing feelings of fear and anxiety. My brain gets into a loop of everything that can go wrong and I can see no hope or positive resolution. I lose all motivation and just want to stay home and hide.

I can obsess about somewhat plausible, yet manageable difficulties, such as getting stuck in traffic and running late, saying the wrong thing to people at work, getting sick at an inopportune time, etc.

It tends to be worse when I'm low on energy, either from being tired or hungry.

During these periods I am highly agitated and irrational. It can take several hours or a day for me to calm down, and then I'm always embarrassed about the way I acted.

I didn't used to be this fearful and affected by risk. Throughout my life I've welcomed new challenges, taken on stretch assignments, and been happy to try new things.

And I'm not all that certain what I'm so freaked out about!

My marriage is healthy. If my job disintegrated, I have other options and nearly a year of living expenses saved. I'm actually on track for retirement. I'm healthy and exercise and spend time with good friends whom I love and respect.

So why am I getting panic attacks? Why am I getting so overwhelmed and scared?",11Jan2019,1
68,"Just a heads up, I posted this over on r/mentalillness too but I thought it would be good to post it here too. Hopefully it's okay. 

---

I don't really know exactly why I am sharing this or why I feel the need to. I guess I just wanted other people to know that you can make it through tough times. So here is my story up to now. It's not a thrill, it'll probably be a bit boring and long but if you stick through to the end then... I appreciate it, haha.
So about me first; I'm a 25 year old male from Australia.
I've struggled with my self esteem and self confidence for as long as I can remember. I recall, as a child, no more than 4 or 5, asking my father if he looked like he does now back when he was a child because I didn't want to look like I did for the rest of my life. That struggle continued through my school years and is still something I have to deal with every single day. It's really the basis for all of my issues with my self worth. Living in a society that puts so much emphasis on our external appearance has a massive impact on me. That side of it is for a different conversation though. That's a long one on it's own.
Throughout my high school years I really began to have issues with my self esteem more than I had before. For those who aren't aware, high school in Australia (I know it can vary from state to state but in mine) is usually years 7-12. So ages 12/13-17/18. Around 9th grade (15) I really started hating myself and my appearance. I'm about 176cm tall (roughly 5'9-10"") and 55kg (I think thats about 129lbs??) so I'm a pretty small guy and I went to a school that put a lot of emphasis on sport. So seeing strong, buff (for their age) and athletic guys was a real struggle for me.
I was kind of in denial about how bad I felt about myself. I confided in one or two female friends and one of them was supportive while the other, probably trying to be, just said it was ""teenage angst"". I've kind of forgotten a lot about high school with it being so long ago. But I will always remember that that is where my negative thoughts really started festering. I would occasionally cry myself to sleep thinking about how ugly I was. I mean, I still look at myself as ugly now, but in high school I was really bad. I didn't have a good haircut and wore really bad glasses. Around late 9th grade I started growing hair on my chest which most guys would love but I always hated. I started shaving it off even though I never took my shirt off in front of anyone. It was just another thing for me to hate about myself.
Plus, being a 'drama kid' I also had to perform in front of the school on a few occasions but that wasn't until year 12 when I got a nic(er) hair cut and didn't look as horrifying, haha.
Fast forward from 2011 to 2015. The years in between were spent basically feeling the same as I did in high school. Hating my appearance. But it gradually became worse and I started hating myself in general, having really really down days for no discernible reason and just being sad in general. I could hide it well from my family though. It helped that they were always out in the day at work/school and I worked in the evenings so I didn't see them all that much. Side point, I'm glossing over a lot here, mostly because I'm writing this at 12:30am, I'm tired and I'm forgetting a lot, haha.
In December 2015 I felt like it was getting so bad that I couldn't handle it anymore. I didn't start self harming, though. Instead I did something about how I was feeling. I went to my doctor. She told me that it sounded like I had a chemical imbalance causing my depression and I was having really negative feelings that I couldn't control. She prescribed me some anti-depressants. I know chemical imbalance depression can be controversial but I'm not here to discuss that side of it. Anyway, a few days later my family had a really terrible crisis and it put a massive strain on all of us. It made it difficult to know if the medication wasn't working or if I was just genuinely sad.
I wish, right now, I could tell you that I was strong and that I never felt the urge to self harm. But that would be a lie. I wish I could tell you that I never succumbed to that urge, that I never hurt myself as a way to deal with the emotional pain, but that would also be a lie.
In 2016 it became so stressful and emotional that, while my family was away for a few days I started hurting myself as a way to let the emotional pain out in a physical way. I didn't do it a lot, but I did a few times over the course of 2016-2017.
I felt, so many times over those years, that I couldn't do it. I couldn't keep living. I felt like I hated myself. I did hate myself. I felt like I was incredibly ugly. Like people only pretended to like me and that they secretly hated me. I would cry myself to sleep frequently. I saw myself as a failure. That not one single person would miss me if I were to die or run away and never come back. I planned where I would run to, how I would do it and what I would change my name to. I felt like I didn't have any friends. I felt sad almost every day for no reason. I struggled to sleep. I didn't eat much. I barely left the house except for work. I spent what should have been the best years of my life, my late teens-early 20s, hating myself, wanting to die, avoiding people, crying... hurting physically and emotionally... living with a massive secret I haven't told anybody and haven't mentioned here. I would go to bed and pray to God that I die in my sleep. I didn't want to wake up the next morning. I'd be sad when I did.
I felt like a waste of a human being.
Now, in 2018, I'm not medicated. I still have days where I am down. I still have days where I hate myself or I feel like people don't really like me and are being nice. I still feel depressed occasionally. I still feel like I'm ugly. I live with anxiety. I still have days where I wake up and feel down. ""Today just isn't a happy day.""
But I'm here. I haven't hurt myself in over a year.
Some negative thoughts and feelings never go away. I'm not going to lie to you. It hurts. It's hard. But it's true. But. If you're ever feeling like you can't get through it. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed with your negative thoughts and feelings. If you ever think you're weak I want you to stop. Stop and tell yourself something. Tell yourself you are strong. You can do it. You can get thought it. How do I know that? How does someone you've literally never met know that?
Well, you're reading this, aren't you? You've punched your way through every day. Some days you might have scars from, but you're still here. You are strong enough to get through any negative feelings you have.
I know it is hard to believe that at times. I've been there, I know. But you can do it.
If you feel like you can't do it, my DMs are always open for a chat. And who knows, I might be having a bad day and talking to you might help me too.
We're all in this together.
Had to get one HSM quote in there ;)
Thanks for anyone who stayed here to the end. I appreciate it.
Much love to all

I'm going to have to call the clinic and find help elsewhere today but that does me no good now. With that said, I started weening myself off of Effexor last week Wednesday. I went from 225mg to 150mg till last Saturday, then 75mg till last Wednesday when I cut it off. I was warned about withdrawal and told to take a 75mg with me to work if things got ugly. Wednesday and Thursday passed with just a few zaps. Easy peasy child's play. Today I left the pill home. BIG MISTAKE. I've got vertigo so bad I feel like I'm falling down a mineshaft and I've thrown up twice. The nausea is pretty bad too. If I had a normal job, I'd just go home. Unfortunately, I'm 150 miles from home in a heavy duty truck. I'm not driving and I won't be until this passes but I'm wondering if it should last an hour or two, or maybe days. If this will be the state of my existence, I'll call a couple guys so one can bring the rig in and another can give me a ride back to the shop. That's the nuclear option and highly frowned upon.

Years later, in my adult years, I tried going back to Vietnam to regain my language, culture, and family ties. I wanted to give back to my community by teaching english. I couldn't find work. Even though I told english speaking cousins to tell everyone for 1.5 years of my plans, I was barely welcomed. People didnt understand or care or try understand my poor accent as to why i was there. My dad's relatives (my aunts and uncles, cousins, and cousin's kids) shunned me, locked me in my room, locked me away from washroom access forcing me to piss in a bag in my own bedroom.   
I went to a hotel to take a break from the bullshit where I was drugged and raped by two hotel workers. I dealt with the canadian consulate and corrupt cops who laughed in my face. Again, even western family shunned me when I needed them most.  
I hate being associated with negative stereotypes, including being a so called drunk indian or dumb asian.  
People I just met will start being racist/prejudice, ""all women, all natives, all asians, all teenagers, all people with tattoos, all ""fat"" people, all ""mental health people, etc............. except you,"" I always hear when they realize that I AM THAT MINORITY. ALL OF THEM.  
Even before the Vietnam incident, so at the age of 21, I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, ptsd, sleep problems, personality disorder,  and whatever else.  What fucking luck do I have in this world?  
I used to work several jobs simultaneously,  get good grades, graduated,  got two college certificates in Indigenous Family Support work and indigenous Human Services.   
I used to teach, do homecare, be a receptionist, manager, cook, cashier, delivery driver, support worker, Indigenous English as a Second Dialect Support Worker, Insigenous Support Worker, tutor, be a caregiver,  a nanny, a makeup artist, an alternative model, a camgirl,... I started working at the age of 10 with my dad on the beach. I dug clams, picked oysters, picked salal   
I earned my shit   
How dare she  
And just because my mental health has declined because of  
Bully bosses  
Car accidents  
Rapes  
Sexual assaults  
My husband father sexually assaultning me in my sleep who is a person of power  
Shit landlords  
Shit roommates  
3 relatives and 2 friends dying in 2016, the same year all those celebrities passed away - bowie, Chyna, lemmy, and so on  
Seeing my grandma die in front of me at a young age. Just like this time again. Diabetes. Even though i was a child, I was the one who called 911 and the paramedics brought her back. My family, my mom already gave up on her and went to go get fast food instead. She almost died again because of diabetes, meds, she had a fall, confusion with meds, lost 22 pounds in about three weeks, and the list goes on.  
Fuck her for saying that taking care of my grandma is not a real job  
Just because i dont want my other sister to use me by getting me to do the bitch work at her studio by doing lashes  
I want to be a tattooer  
I was thinking of doing areola restorative tattoos for people with mastectomies and transgendered people   
I used to art  
I used to yoga  
Bike

Jog  
Gym  
Pool  
Kickbox

Trampoline  
Travel  
Carnival  
Movies  
Video games  
Board games  
And so on  
I have lost myself  
I have lost joy  
What brings me life is my grandma  
She has taught me to be strong  
The fact that she went to residential school   
She got strapped and bullied and whatever else. Kept away from her dying grandma. Stripped from her small family, language, culture. We have no language or culture either on that side either because of this  
Colonization  
I am more than a fucking loser  
And I rarely tell myself that  
I just dont understand  
And always feel like  
why me  
What now  
You think you hit rock bottom and it goes on  
My husband and I were in $80,000 in debt. $20,000 alone just by dealing with Vietnam, thousands of dollars in counselling, medical, and self care. We didnt touch our banking cards since December 15, and in interest alone, owed $1000.  
How in the fuck is anybody supposed to make it? By keeping their mouths shut  
I haven'tseen a counselor in a month and waiting another month for my new one because of money, moving, and helping grandma  
Last year  
I missed  a shit ton of work because my husbands father got cancer  
And the day of surgery, after waiting all day and him fasting for two, at 5 pm, they had go reachedule hos surgery.  
We already rescheduled our trip, hotels, work, and so on just to be there for him. Even though he did that to me. I set aside my differences   
So we went on our trip  
He had surgery  
He went straight from the airport to his moms hotel then his dads hospital room anand missed more work  
He supposedly was supposed to take 5days to heal, he took 17 days  
17 days of dealing with both of his shitty toxic parents.  
His mom was and is a horrible alcoholic  
Okay  
She has a horrible alcohol addiction to be PC  
And so she would literally drink and wake up all hours of the night and slam the hotel doors just to get up and check to see if he was still sleeping, in and out. Fucjing drinking beers in a coffee mug starting at least at 5 a.m.  as if we wouldn't know.  
When Vietnam happened and I told her, the first thing she said was ""get over it. We all get raped.""  
Last year when I admitted ""on Facebook "" and had my rants, that o was suicidal, and I had a hard time admitting to my husbands family about being suicidal, she started drunk ranting about her dad  
My husband is also half native half Irish with a clusterfuck of mental health, addictions, and so on in his family   
His first memory is of his 16 year old brother shooting himself in the head when he was 3.  
The year we started dating, 2006, just before that, his other brother died drinking and driving  
One day my husband drew something for me. He always draws. He is an artist...  
He drew something that looked like a hand and a scrunched up paper bag...  
He was upset as if I should have realized that it was his brothers nloody hand, grabbing his moms shirt after his cad slammed into the pole and his body flung from his car. That's his last living memory of that brother who I also never met.  
He was in the military for 6.5 years. And only recently, he finally admitted some of the shit he held in and saw. He hides some of it because hes trying to protect me  
He hides some of it because his dad used to beat the shit out of him if he cried for not being a ""real man""  
His dad went to residential school and so did several others in his family. His dad is homophobic and i dont doubt it's because of residential school   
One of his uncles has his tongue cut out from being in residential school   
I can go on and on and on  
.  
I try empathize , understand, and forgive, but it's too much to hold in  
I'm tired of these secrets  
I think that's why people get sick  
Cancer  
Mental health, obviously  
Addictions, obviously  
Etc  
These seem obvious to me, but my family, his family is in denial   
Ugh  
Just  
Let  
Me  
Go  
I've brought myself in to the hospital to admit I was suicidal twice in the last year.  
That's it  
And if I kept quiet, nobody would have any idea why  
And I usually do  
Bite my tongue.  
the quiet observer  
The peace keeper  
But i am exhausted  
I am tired of staying strong  
And my husband is finally getting professional help  
But its bullshit  
I know theres bullshit about keeping professional life and relationships separate  
But that'z bullshit  
Anybody should empathize and understand when family is sick and fucking dying  
I dont understand such privileged little shits like my sister. Same parents. Just a weird shit geneation/age gap  
It scares me  
The future   
It's why I never wanted kids  
But colonialism/colonization wont win  
It wont ""kill the indian inside us""  
I want my shit straightened before having kids  
I am excited to try help build a better future by teaching right from wrong  
Respect  
Empathy  
Understanding   
Love  
To give  
This can be seen as weakness  
But i dont give a fuck   
Lifes to fucjing short to take take take  
Nobody will give a shit about you when you die. You will die feeling empty and alone  
Anyways  
Its 547 a.m.  
 I should eat and try go back to sleep

Hi guys. Just thought I’d share my BDD experience (link below). This was a hard thing to talk about but I think its important we do.

75,"Tl;Dr
I was happy. Then I got mugged and lost my long term partner. Dropped put of uni and lost all my friends. I don't feel like me anymore and I'm lonely.

I feel as though I've lost my identity. Up until I was 21 i knew who I was, I had friends, a long term partner (8 years). Life goals, I was studying at university. Had a career planned out for myself. 

In 2015 I was mugged, I stopped leaving the house for months. This put a strain on my relationship with my partner and friends. I remember my partner calling me weak for not fighting the muggers off, and saying she was embarrassed by me as I was gaining weight and because I would jump when strangers got too close passing by on the street. 

I was too immature to handle the situation and we ended up arguing a lot. I later found out she'd been seeing someone at her university for a few months and she went no contact with me. My friends all eventually stopped inviting me out because I isolated myself as well.

Fast forward to many months of this and in 2017 I broke down and attempted suicide. After that failed I dropped out of university and went home. 

Since then I guess my mental health has improved a lot. I'm now working in care and hoping to go back to university to study prothetics (artificial limbs). I started doing things I enjoy again like drawing as well.

The only thing that I haven't gotten back is my identity. I still have no friends. The only people I talk to are my family, colleagues, and the occasional shop keeper. I've become a very quiet person who doesn't think much of myself or my future prospects. I'm just not who I was anymore. And I feel it in the way I act, in everything in do and like. I miss the old me who was hyper and silly And would make jokes and hang out with my friends doing dumb things.

Not the me who sits at home alone and does nothing much. Who cries sometimes because their lonely and falls asleep listening to YouTube because it feels like having a friend talking to me.",11Jan2019,1

Addiction is a biological, psychological, social, environmental inefficiency and inability to stop the consumption of any chemical, drugs, medication, activity, or substance abuse, even if it is causing physical and psychological problems in the body and mind.

The addictive disorder is a group of disorders that can cause psychological and physical harm. When a person suffers from addictive disorders, they do not understand how they use any substances and cannot control how they stop his critical conditions and take part in any activity, and they become reliant on it to cope with daily life problems. It is necessary to get treatment to break the cycle of addiction.

77,"does anyone else feel like your illness is a competition? 

It’s hard to explain, so i’ll give an example:

Me and sally both have depression. I have a good few months, and am not feeling depressed anymore. Sally then tells me that she is slipping again and getting into depression, she maybe says that she’s self harmed. 
Now that I know that sally is slipping, I feel like it’s a competition, and that I need to slip also, so I can be “more depressed” than her. 

The same can be for recovery, say Sally is doing amazing but i’m not, I feel like I need to get ahead of her and do better in my recovery.

It’s so stupid, but please tell me i’m not the only one who feels like mental illnesses are competitive, in recovery and also in who’s suffering more. 
",11Jan2019,1
78,"  I really wanted to get this off my chest for some time now, I really don't know if this is the best place but I've realised that I have so many issues with my mental health that are affecting my personality and my performance with school and other things I have to do.

  I'm a procrastinator for as long as I remember. I never succeeded to get things done in time because I was couch potato and that's not the ending, I also got a thing called RMD(rhytmic movement disorder) and I'm addicted to rocking my body to help myself sleep, without it I wouldn't be able to sleep. But I also do it while I got home from school, when I'm bored etc. 75% of my day is spent doing this.

  I was abused by my father when I was little and that went on for 3 or 4 years. After some time I was diagnosed with ADHD, and I was expelled from 2 teachers during primary school. And since I started school in total I switched over 3 schools in total and 7 classes. So I wasn't a favorite between students, neither I am now. 

  During 8 grade I have fallen into a depression from which I haven't recovered from yet. But sometimes is a hard thing to cope with, I have some dark hours. I'm a really shy person, I'm not feeling very smart, I get really anxious sometimes, but in public I manage to hide it because I use some walls to protect me from people getting involved in my shit. I feel like I shouldn't live, but at the same time I feel like I'm the chosen one, and I'll change the world someway. There are many moments when I feel I'm trapped in this body of mine, and I should have been someone else. To boost my confidence I tend to copy and make myself believe I'm another person.

  I had and I still have a lot of friends, but sometimes I feel like their friendship it's not real. I'm a very loyal person, and I need all the attention I could get from a friend else I feel they are not my friend. Loneliness is my all time fear. But still I tend to spend my time alone, I created a comfortable yet a painful private hell. And it's killing me. But I'm helpless. I'm in love with music and I get very creative but because of my procrastination I'm getting nowhere.

  I'm lonely and disperate, I wish I could find a girl, but I tend to get bored or feel very bad because I feel like I could be replaced in a second. And because of my ego, I always say the last word during break up. I always try to do in a way I am in the brighter side of the story. It matters a lot for me what others think about me.

  Since I discovered drugs and alcohol my life changed, I was who I wanted, all the anxiety went away, I felt free from my fears without inhibitions and I loved being able to do whatever I wanted. And soon got addicted. From then my mental health is falling apart more and more every day and I can't help it. ",11Jan2019,1
79,"I am 28 years old and have been depressed for over three years. Every single morning I wake up with the same feeling of weight on my shoulders and yes, the classic cloud over my head. 

I got laid off from work on 12/19/18. This obviously triggered my depression even more. The last two weeks have been some of the absolute worse of my life. I had no motivation to get a new job because my previous one was my dream position and I was planning on staying with the company for over 20 years, but didn’t even last 4 months since they outsourced my position (they were a very new start up apartment management company). 

Last night I did what I basically always do, lay down on my extremely uncomfortable couch, eat food that is not good for me, and watch Netflix until I doze off. I woke up a couple hours later, feeling just as awful as always and made my way to my bed for the remaining hours of the night.

I am unsure if this is relevant but I had a strange dream last night (after I had made my way to my bed). It was my 10 year high school reunion but there were only people there that I haven’t spoke to since high school in attendance and we were in a shopping mall cafeteria. I saw my very first ex girlfriend who I dated my freshmen year (and to this day my longest relationship, mostly by choice) and I was going to speak with her. 

Just as I was going to walk over to her, my late best friend, who died senior year three days after graduation from a drinking and driving accident suddenly appeared next to me and walked over to her first and I just remember thinking, “oh, that’s okay”.  Which is strange. I have had dreams on betrayal before and the dream usually intensifies my emotional response.

Boom, I wake up at 7:00 AM with no alarm. 

I have this overwhelming sense joy in my chest.  I can’t explain it. I have noticed that I basically hate all cliche things with a passion. Have you ever seen a movie and someone is dancing by themselves? I think that is the most annoying fucking thing in the world. As I stated earlier, I am currently unemployed but I was awake at 7:00 AM and I was dancing along with music in my head as I was getting ready, completely conscious of this new feeling of happiness. 

I keep thinking “why the fuck am I so happy right now”? Is this a temporary relief from depression or could this be permanent? I don’t ever want to lose this feeling because I know how awful it is to live with depression.",11Jan2019,1
80,"My 10 year relationship recently ended yesterday, and this might seem pathetic but, because of my issues with anxiety, depression and low self-esteem, I’m afraid I won’t find anyone else to love me or be with me... He was all I knew and he was my everything, ever since I was 14 to now at 24... I don’t know how to cope or move on yet, and I’m prone to getting overly attached to people and things, I guess as a form of comfort, so I’m afraid I’ll never move on. I just need advice I guess and I didn’t know where to turn... ",11Jan2019,1
81,"For a little background: I am 23 years old and I just got promoted from my job as a teller to being a full time position in a back office job. The department I work in is about 16 people - most have been there for more than 15 years. I suffer with chronic social anxiety so it’s hard for me to connect with people for a while during transitions like this. 

I love my new position. It’s challenging, the pay and benefits are good, and I’m good at it. However, my new co-workers are ALWAYS talking bad about me. When I say talking bad, I mean, they make fun of my hair or my outfits or the few words I do say. 

There is another new person there and we have sort of been confiding in each other because we understand the struggles of being new. So one day I was upset because they were talking about me &amp; she asked what’s wrong. All I said is “I’m just tired of people talking shit all the time”. The next day, I heard one of the women I work with say exactly what I said &amp; continue talking shit about “if you think that’s bad - you haven’t seen anything yet”. And continued talking about how I’m a hillbilly (probably the plaid shirt I was wearing).

The thing is, every time she says something bad about me everyone laughs. So that let’s me know NOBODY likes me. I don’t understand because I’m quiet, polite, and I have been doing well at my job. I just don’t feel welcomed and I have thought about discussing switching departments but I don’t want to seem like a baby who can’t handle a couple of grown ass women talking shit. 

The problem is that I already have depression and this is worsening it - so I need advise about how to not let things like this affect me to the point where it’s damaging to my mental health. ",11Jan2019,1

However, since last year, he's been struggling with financial and family related issues, as well as low self esteem, and I'm concerned for his mental health. This has made him disillusioned about his future and is killing his motivation to study, talk to his friends, and plan his future altogether.

The thing is, he doesn't like to talk about it, even though I make clear that he can come talk to me about his problems if he wants to. He said he's grateful but denied my offer. I fear that this may be bad for him, as he's already told me that his family isn't always there for him, as he has a complicated relationship with his parents and his mother is always away because of her job.

Shortly after I started and committed to this yoga class, a DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) group opened up. It is at the same time as the yoga class. No there are not other times for THIS yoga class, no there is not another group.

I've been trying to make this decision. It has been eating me alive. I haven't been able to even go to individual therapy either, so this has just been bouncing around in my head and I just don't know what the fuck. Talked on the phone with therapist today, of course he convinced me to do the group. Now I'm worried it's the wrong decision, and I'm feeling progressively worse. And then because I got an appointment with new therapist, I cancelled appointment with old therapist, and now I'm not sure (again) about new therapist and want to cancel, but then I won't have either appointments, and just......... uggghhhhh

I don't know how people make decisions. I've been in therapy for 6 years. My life continues to be the same and I don't know why. I wonder if it's because I'm not living my life. I wonder if I use therapy as an excuse to postpone living my life and looking within. But I just don't fucking know.

When I’m sober, I do not engage in those behaviors because I am not trying to run away from my adult responsibilities and I’m not drained from the addiction. 

So how do I admit I’m in addiction, I’m powerless over it, and my life is unmanageable? 

Well after pulling another late night at a massage parlor at 1230am for the third day in a row, I finally admitted I had a problem. I was powerless over my lust and my life was totally unmanageable. 

I mean what “normal” person goes out to a massage parlor after midnight? Exactly. No one. I just couldn’t accept that I had a problem. 

But now that I have, I am out of the depression. I’m out of the addiction. But just for today. I have to admit this powerlessness each day or else I will go back to the addiction and thus the depression.

I (28F) have been dating my partner (29M) for over a year, and we have a great, healthy relationship. He admitted to me early on that he had a history of mental illness, and I chose not to pry because it didn't seem like he was quite ready to talk about it. I too have struggled with mental illness, and it has never been a deterrent for me in relationships.

A few weeks ago, he confessed to me that he has Primarily Obsessional OCD. I was familiar with OCD (it runs in my family) but I had never heard of PO OCD before, and quickly did research to try to understand what he'd been going through. As far as I understand, it wouldn't be helpful to either of us for him to share his intrusive thoughts with me, but I do wonder if it would be helpful for me to be able to identify when he's having them, or if he's having an episode (I don't think it has ever happened in my presence, but I could just be totally ignorant - I am very new to this).

I am so happy that he was open about it with me, and I feel like I now understand some of his behaviours a bit better. This is also one of the best relationships I have ever been in, and I want to put in the work to ensure that I'm being as supportive as I can be without being triggering or giving him reassurance.

A couple of months before christmas I noticed that I wasn't feeling like myself. Like, I was panicking over everything and crying and feeling awful.

I literally got a panick attack or something when I raised my hand in class when we were having a discussion. Like, I WANTED to say my opinion, and once the teacher pointed at me, I couldn't get a word out of my mouth and started sweating and shaking and my face went red.
The same thing happened when I got to school one day and noticed that my period had started and I had blood on my light grey pants,so ot was very visible. Like, I was literally crying in the bathroom, even though I could have just gotten my bike and went home to change my pants (which I eventually did, but was late to class and shaking again when I got there).

I've also been feeling like I'm just a waste of space and will never be anything useful. I don't know what I want to do after high school, I have no idea what career I would want, everything I might be interested in is very difficult and I don't think I could even get the education for,and my grades suck even though I really try my best. And that makes my oarents really mad at me, which makes me even more stressed.
Even in the school subjects where I thought I was good or ok at, my grades suck. Even in art (not saying that I ahould be getting the best grades from art or anything or that I'm some master artist blah blah blah, was just dissapointed when I saw my grades) 

I constantly feel like everyone hates me and just pretends to like me because they'd feel bad if they didn't, even the people I've been friends with for over 9 years (almost 10) and who have always been there for me, no matter what.

Also my mom is mad at me and I have no idea what I did wrong, she hasn't spoken to me all day, except when she came to yell at me when I didn't come eat the second she told me to.

And I've been eating very little and have no appetite at all, which I hate because I'm already skinny enough and feel gross because my arms are so unnaturally skinny and my spine ia so visible and one girls told me once that it lookes gross. And I'm super hairy everywhere, eacpecially on my arms so I can't wear a T-shirt, and my mom is like ""No you can't shave your arms, it's a pain in the ass! And I've seen people with more hair than you and your's is barely visible (which is a lie, btw, the hair on my arms is very much visible and dark)"" 

I tried to talk to my parents about the panick attacks I keep having almost every day, but they just started making jokes and laughing, and then got mad at me when I got upset. So now I don't want to even talk to yhem about it.
And my best friend is telling me to go to our school nurse to talk about this stuff, but I CAN'T talk to a stranger, it just feels so weird and I'm scared she'll just be like ""oh it's ok, you're a teenager and this is normal, just eat healthily and get some sleep and you'll be fine"". I mean, sure, if that's really all I need then that's great! But at the same time, I try my best to be healthy, but after a sy or two I just lose all motivation because I don't have an appetite and just can't sleep.

I want to fucking kill myself but I'm a coward and just can't bring myself to do it so I'm just waiting for SOMETHING to happen. ",11Jan2019,1
95,"Hi, I’m 18 F. I have been battling with dysthymia &amp; anxiety since I was 11. I’ve been going to therapy since 11, and we’ve tried everything besides medication because I just refused. As years went on the ‘black cloud’ as we refer to as my sadness wouldn’t leave. I was raped on my 15th birthday and that lead to having PTSD. Today, my therapist really encouraged me to get onto medication &amp; I thought about it. I saw a psychiatrist and he asked me why haven’t I come sooner and that just hurt me so bad because of my pride. I didn’t want it to defeat me, but it did and I’m ashamed of it. They prescribed me Paxil and I start tonight. I just feel so defeated and disappointed in myself. I told myself that I would be able to handle this without medication. Has anyone ever taken Paxil? How did it work for you? ",11Jan2019,1
96,"Hi Reddit,

To start, he is clinically diagnosed with depression. He's a 22 year old male.

I've been friends with him for 10 years now and he's always had a hard life and struggled with depression. He went to college after high school but dropped out in the middle of his second year. He married and lived off of family money to get started and they both worked minimum wage jobs to get by. He was able to save some money and maintain his life, but after things went bad he wasn't able to work enough to pay his bills. He ended up in debt and lost the apartment he lived in. He was going to go back to live with his grandmother, but she lived in a rural area with barely any job opportunities. He also had resentment towards her for how bad his childhood was, so I offered my house to him so he could get on his feet.

I offered no rent so he could pay his debt, he just had to handle the chores in the home. I told him he needed an education so if life throws another curve ball then he would have a safety net. I work in IT with job experience and only certifications, and I do well enough. I told him he didn't need college and that a cert could get him into a good field like welding or IT. I even offered to pay for the test. He told me before moving here that he would study for one and get a job. It's been 3 months and he has made no progress on his education and he works a part time job with only 10-20 hours per week. He watches TV and plays games and he has made little effort to better himself even when he has free time at home for 90% of the time.

I have confronted him and he always says he's depressed and unmotivated and that he's off his meds. I asked what he was going to do then, because if you're working a job that makes no money and you aren't raising your employment level, then you're gonna be stuck in a rut forever. He says he'll just die if he has no where to live. We can't get him social security for another 5 months and he says he can't afford a doctor visit to get the meds. I understand depression can be crippling, but I see no drive from him to get better and I'm not sure if the meds will help. If I wait 5 months and he doesn't get that motivation from the meds then would I have just been used? Is it all the depression or is he being lazy too? I can't get into his head but it's crazy to me that your friend would be fully supporting you and you wouldn't be determined to get a least a second part time job.

Are there any counselors he can go to before he gets his social security? Am I giving him too much so he doesn't have a reason to try? I want to tell him that he's either gonna get a full time job/education or he has to leave, but I'm scared because he has this mindset that he'll just lay down and die, or is he saying all that to hold me emotionally hostage? I don't want to assume anything, but he doesn't act like a depressed man. He acts like a lazy man. He talks about laying down and dying and how he doesn't enjoy life, but he still laughs and smiles and he's always down to go out and do stuff. He says it's just how he reacts but he doesn't actually feel the emotion of joy. Is that something that can happen with depression?

First, I woke up too late so I couldn’t eat breakfast. Then I got to school and I thought I was doing okay, but I got super light headed and just really needed a hug and a nap. Got called retarded, went to lunch, and just got really jealous. It sucks when you have one of those beautiful friends and they get praise for it. I just had a panic attack, right there, because my only “good” attribute is that I’m “aesthetic”? It makes me hurt. I know I’m not beautiful, I’m not smart, don’t have any talents, but still. It sucks when other people know that too. And then I wanted to see the counselor, and talk it out, but she wasn’t there. And I couldn’t keep my tears in for the rest of the day.

100,"I’m currently in a mental health crisis at my parents house in my home town. I normally live in London as I study there.

I won’t go into too much detail but if I return to London I will end up committing suicide.

In my hometown I’m being treated with the home team (they come to your house and check up on you)

The goal is to get me back to London so I can continue with university.

I think the only way that will effectively aid my transition back to London is if I was taken there by someone straight into an inpatient facility so I can experience the fear of returning and be helped through it without being a danger to myself. 

Is it okay to ask for this kind of help? I understand that I am demonstrating a strange amount of rational thinking for someone who is experiencing very strong suicidal inclinations but that is also partially what has caused alarm to my situation, because I’ve ‘rationally’ decided to take my life if I go back to London.

I’m dissociated currently so apologies if this doesn’t make sense.

101,"I know this happens, it's just starting up and getting strong. I don't want to feel uncomfortable in session because she's amazing and the only counselor I've ever liked and actually talked to. I don't want to lose her. I am 25/F and she is (probably) 30/F. I think about hooking up with her and I usually never fantasize like this about anyone. Having sex with my fiance doesn't get me off, and obviously having MH issues and being on my meds, I don't have a sex drive. If I knew she was gay, and not as professional as she is, I'd pursue it for sure.

I'm posting because I just want to tell someone, and hear any thoughts others have. Have you ever felt this way towards a same sex therapist? Did it end up affecting your relationship?

102,"Short back story, my friend 30(f) started exhibiting signs of schizophrenia about a year ago. Delusions, paranoia, all of the common signs. Her family tried to get her admitted by saying she was suicidal (even though she wasn't) so they couldn't keep her. She's incredibly smart and also stubborn and has convinced herself that she is fine. I've known her since we were kids and although I'm not a licensed therapist or psychologist I can tell she is not ok and needs the help of a medical professional as soon as possible. My heart breaks every time we speak. She only calls me when she's paranoid and tells me everyone is trying to bring her down. She's convinced someone in her city has somehow made a city Facebook page with her picture warning everyone of her because whenever she goes places people seem like they're out to get her.

I've tried to lightly suggest she should go seek therapy especially since she's going through so much but is super resistant to it. Her family has tried (given they are not the best support) but she denies she needs any help and they are out to get her too.

Any suggestions on how I can help convince her? I'm terrified that she will hurt herself if left untreated. ",11Jan2019,1
103,"So, my husband (38M) and I (30F) both suffer from mental illness and we work really hard to have a happy, healthy marriage. We have had lots and lots of counseling, together and individually, and we agree that we are now doing really well in general. In fact, much better than we ever have! We have one toddler son together and we tend to be a great team when it comes to parenting. We just have one big issue we cannot seem to get past, and that is my Borderline episodes.

They only happen about once every couple of months now and only when I have been losing a lot of sleep. I start to cry, and if nobody comforts me, it slowly escalates until I am screaming and 100% convinced that everyone is out to get me and that I need to divorce my husband. It sucks for everyone involved, and we have an action plan in place for when they do happen. The action plan is for my husband and it is a set of instructions for him to follow, like give me a hug and tell me we are a team when he sees me starting to cry. We developed this plan with our therapists, and my husband agreed to use it. Only, he almost never does. A few times he has done it and it absolutely worked - we did not escalate the fight and I was able to apologize, take responsibility,, and remedy my actions. Usually, though when I start to get upset, he completely ignores the plan and engages in the fight with me. I know that it is really hard to follow the plan in the moment, but he did agree to do it. Afterwards, when I finally calm down, I ask him why he ignored the plan, and he basically just tells me I get so crazy that he gets too upset and does not want to hug me or talk to me. I am at a loss.

I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, although I do not currently meet all of the criteria to qualify for the disorder (usually you need to have at least 5 qualifying factors for a diagnosis) but I still just go through life as though I always have BPD and it always needs monitoring. I don’t self-harm or threaten suicide or even really freak out anymore, and I do a lot of self care. I still recognize that I can be hard to be with. I have been released from therapy because my therapist felt that I had rehabilitated and now possess all the tools I need to cope with normal struggles, but the door is still open if I feel like I need to go back. I have not felt the need to go back and nobody has suggested that I do. So, except for these nuclear fights, I am doing really well.

The fights always start over something minor (last night it was that my husband did not put up the baby gate so our son got into an off-limits area) and ends up with us screaming in each other’s faces. I always feel like I start off calm, I express myself, my husband will debate with me about my issue and then I feel unheard, I start crying, my husband won’t reach out to me because he thinks I am crying for attention, I get angry and resentful, I start yelling, he yells back, I tell him I don’t know why we are even married, one of us says we are leaving, then my husband hears this and suddenly decides to be nice, at which point I am at nuclear meltdown level and will just push him away and tell him he is too late.

None of this feels fair. It is unfair for him to have a wife who is mentally broken. It is unfair for me to have to deal with this illness. It is unfair for him to agree to follow a specific set of guidelines and then fail to do that in the moment. It is unfair for me to expect that to be easy when I am screaming and/or crying.

When we talk calmly about it, my husband says that he can see how just reaching out to me would absolutely help. It has worked in the past, on the few occasions he was able to try it. He says he knows it will work but that it feels like he is just rewarding me for bad behavior. I said that it is not fair for him to take on a parental role for me, and reminded him that the roles have been reversed before with his mental illnesses (he has bipolar and adhd) and that stance only created conflict then, too. I pointed out that this stance also consistently escalates our fights, so it also does not even work to curb my “bad behavior.” He agreed, but he also said that he shouldn’t have to deal with me when I “fly off the handle.” 

I finally said that if he cannot accept all of me, he gets none of me. I know I am not easy to be with but I am not begging him to stick around or be with me, either. I have been clear about my limits and my needs to the point that two therapists agreed that the action plan was a healthy and acceptable course of action for me, and my husband signed off on it. I don’t want to split up, but I also can’t keep doing this. I understand my own limits and needs, and if he is unable to agree to them, we don’t need to keep doing this. I don’t want to make him suffer through my episodes but I also don’t deserve to be treated like a burden when I am doing everything I can to reduce the emotional load of my problems. 

Thanks for reading. My husband is at a dental appointment and then I am sure we will talk again, but now I have little hope that the words will be anything but hollow promises.",11Jan2019,1
104,"Hi, I'm looking for some help. I'm a 16 year old student in the UK sitting GCSEs (interrnational exams) and preparing for SATs (I am a US citizen and plan to move there for uni) at a highly competitive, high level private school. However, I have recently started to get to a point where I feel like I almost cannot continue: my sleep schedule has been thrown off (if lucky I get 6 hours a day), I have feelings of worthlessness, swings in hunger and I have started snacking regularly, leading me to put on weight. I have also started developing what Google tells me are stress-related tics: random spasms of my upper eyelid and the muscles in my left arm. This is obviously far from ideal: these exams are key to my future as a student and in the long run, to getting into the uni I want to go to and for getting the job I want. 
I am going to try and see a school counsellor at some point in the next few weeks (I am currently sitting mock exams) but have no interest in telling my parents this; they are kind and understanding, but I don't want to burden them with this and change our relationship and it is much easier to vent anonymously online.
In the short term, do you  guys have any effective tips for coping with stress (to stop my tics), getting to sleep more easily and controlling/avoiding snacking?

105,"I am a 15 year old who has extremely controlling parents. They have access to all my online media accounts, and regularly inspect my browser history, so I have created a fake email to make this post. I have a severe form of a medical condition called misophonia(auditory processing disorder which causes a fight or flight response) which limits my life quite a bit(I have to go to an online school). There are no known cures and no real treatments to misophonia, but misophonia is related to stress so living a calm peaceful life seems to make it a little better for me. I have tried all the treatments suggested for misophonia(progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, trigger tamer) My parents, one of which is a former doctor, are extremely frustrated that there is no treatment for misophonia and have been giving me medicines which they think will help it. This started with Prozac, to improve my mood, which I did get a prescription for. However, it did nothing even after months of use, so my parents started giving me ambien, to try to relax me, without a prescription. Eventually they stopped this, and started giving me a blood pressure medication called propananol. Propananal is known to relax you, dull the fight or flight reaction, cause sleepiness, and my parents theorized it would help my condition as it causes a fight or flight reaction. I hated taking it so much, as it made me incredibly sleepy and unable to think, and did not seem to help me, so after a month I began pretending to swallow it and started throwing it away. I had told my parents I did not want to take it because it made me feel awful, but my parents didn’t listen. My parents did not find out and after another month, decided to double the dosage - luckily I wasn’t taking it. After a few weeks, my parents decided to try another medication, Paxil. They got a prescription for this, but I do not know what they told the doctor as they keep me out of doctors appointments. My mother is very jumpy, and she says that when she took Paxil it made her less jumpy. This was their absurd basis for giving me the medication. Of course, I strongly opposed it, but they ignored me. I tried it for one day, and that day was absolutely horrible - I was dizzy to the point of passing out, constantly hungry, dry mouth, and experienced a hallucination. I told my parents this and they blamed it on getting bad sleep and eating too much salty ramen. I stopped taking Paxil immediately. Unfortunately a week after that, my parents discovered that I was not taking Paxil and that I hadn’t taken propananol. They got extremely mad at me. A week passed, and my parents took me to a doctor who prescribed the medicines. My parents are about to start forcing me to take the medicines again, and I am afraid and I don’t know what to do. When I talk to them about this, they ignore me and give me no say in the issue. Additionally, I am completely healthy except for the misophonia. What should I do? 

Please do not make a big deal out of this, like calling 911 or trying to find my parents, if worse comes to worse I have to take the medicines es which make me feel bad. Serious replies only please. ",11Jan2019,1

17 Male

Ever since my late childhood/ early adolescent years I have suffered with depression and anxiety but over the last couple months my mental state has started to deteriorate rapidly I'm worried that I may be on the cusp of developing a more severe mental disorder. Recently I have noticed that I am experiencing extremely paranoid delusions. Delusions where I am always thinking people are going to start fighting me at any moment. Whenever I walk past someone I don't know on the street I tense up and get ready to fight them and I vividly imagine defending myself against an attack and planning where I would run to. I am aware that this is delusional but I can't seem to stop doing it. I can never put my guard down until I become comfortable with a person and even then I am suspicious that something is going on. Even my close friends, who I meet up with regularly and have done so for four years, are becoming objects of my paranoia. I always think the worst of them, I think that they are trying to steal from me and I think that they aren't really my friends, they don't like me, and that they are pretending to be friendly so they can manipulate me and take advantage of me. I truly think everyone is fake most of the time and I never trust anyone at all so I always prepare myself for the worst case scenarios. I have also started to notice that I am making extravagant links to random matters that are completely unrelated whatsoever. For example my teacher may be teaching a specific topic like the human biological response to physical attraction to another person and I'll believe that it's because she can tell that I ""fancy"" another member of the class, so I will watch the teachers eye contact to see whether she looks at me or another when saying specific words like ""attraction"". I also think things like my mood has an effect on the weather or I will count the  amount of white vans that pass me in case they are undercover police. I know sounds crazy as fuck but I'm always in a paranoid bubble that I can't break out of. However, I have tried to diagnose these delusions by looking at aspects that might be causing them other than mental illness. Firstly I stopped cannabis and drug consumption for a month just to clear my mind but the delusions still persisted through that month and in fact continued to further increase in frequency as they have been doing for months. ( I know it is possible that drugs may have caused all this to begin and the damage is probably irreversible due to my frequent abuse of weed and infrequent abuse of several other drugs including but not exclusively LSD, MDMA, 2C-B, Codeine, Benzos, Nitrous Oxide, Inhalants, Morphine, Pregabalin.)  Secondly I just attributed this all to the vivid imagination that I've always had but I'm pretty sure that most people, even those that are heavily creative, don't believe figments of their imaginations to be reality as I have started doing. Thirdly a reason for my paranoia around people may be because of a mugging that happened to me a few months back where my friends ran off and left me alone to deal with it myself but this doesn't explain the non-violent delusions I am experiencing as well as the violent ones. This has lead me into researching causes and a close friend of mine suggested I might be experiencing the early symptoms of something like psychosis. 

Other things that I have started experiencing more often are: Auditory hallucinations before I sleep (but I'm still completely awake and aware of them. Also, they don't say much they just sound like abstracted human voices), visual hallucinations when I smoke weed that none of my friends seem to get when smoking the same buds, visual and tactile hallucinations when waking up (once I saw a hand on my pillow for a brief second and it scared the shit out of me then I realised it wasn't there), constant visual static at all times (what once were solid colours are now objects constructed of sporadically changing tiny pixel like things that sometimes flash quite bright, incoherent thoughts and thought patterns (regularly forgetting topics of conversations and blanking out when people are speaking to me, lack of motivation, slight lack of coordination (some days I walk like Jack Sparrow and crash into things even when I'm completely sober lol), night terrors (being trapped in dreams that are truly terrifying. I'm pretty sure I sold my soul to the devil in one because he trapped me in a cycle of being asleep and being awake for a few hours. (I'm not even religious but it was a bad night)), inconsistent sleep schedule (recently I've sleeping alright, I just wake up really early which is unusual because I usually sleep till 11-12am if I'm left alone), manic and depressive episodes, confusion, suicidal thoughts (this has been the average for a while so nothings changed with that lol).

A lot of these things don't really affect me at all apart from the paranoia and delusions which really distract me from school and have caused me to fight with many of my friends. All other hallucinations are kinda minor but are becoming more frequent, I'm just scared what will happen if they get worse. I don't think this shit will mix well with my severe depression and all that other crap. I just need someone to tell me what they experienced as they developed psychosis or something similar just so I can judge whether I should get this checked out or not. Also if anyone can give advice or anything it will be great and I appreciate it. Also sorry if this is the wrong place to post, idk, just need to get this shit of my chest idk who to talk about it to. ",11Jan2019,1

The thing is, after I feel so tired. Probably from my heart-rate going from super fast to normal and general mental exhaustion. I unfortunately feel this way 2-5 times a week and it takes me HOURS before I feel like I have the energy to do things.

I’m a college student who also works so I really need more efficient ways of recovering, but I also understand I’ll need to designate some time of recovery. Thanks!",11Jan2019,1
114,"I don't know if this is the right place, but I need to vent and organize my thoughts.

I feel like in the last year or so something happened to my brain and now I can't feel things the way I used to. Most of the time I feel nothing. I used to feel so sad and alone but now that's gone, it hasn't been replaced by good things, but by nothingness. A year ago small things like watching the sunrise would give me a nice feeling of calmness but now I can hardly remember what that felt like.

I'm indifferent to the people who I used to care so much about, in fact I wish they would just get out of my life and leave me alone. I can't stand having people worry about me. I have no mental energy, I can't concentrate on anything and I get bored easily, I have no physical (?) energy either. I get tired very quickly. 

I think what bothers me the most is the lack of emotions, it's like there's a wall between me and the rest of the world, or like there's something that's stopping me from being able to feel but I don't know what it is. No matter what I do or where I am there's always this thing that makes me feel oppressed and disconnected. I think about suicide almost every day. ",11Jan2019,1
115,"By biggest issue with my depression is motivation, mainly in regards to personal hygiene. My teeth suffer the most, at 21 I am currently in the early stages of gum disease. My dentist has told me it's now or never to turn it around and avoid full-blown gum disease. I still can't bring myself to brush my teeth. A good week is 2minutes, 3 times a week. Does anyone have any advice on how to actually just brush my teeth? I hate the idea of looking after myself and making myself feel 'good', but I know it needs to be done. I just can't bring myself to do it. ",11Jan2019,1
116,"nothing to say. i always leave people behind because i don't seem to understand how human relationships work. i don't ever contact people if i'm not needing anything practical from them. when i do, i'm certain i'm bothering them and that they for sure don't like me. i don't want to talk to people cause it gives me anxiety and i end up saying weird or rude shit anyways, even when i want to come out as friendly and kind as i think i am. i always smile because people treat me better when i'm smiling. my lips and facial muscles sometimes hurt from doing this and i feel exhausted all the time. i avoid people and at the same time i force myself to seem happy when i see them.
now that i live alone and go to university people try to approach me, but i don't understand why they want to engage with me. they talk to me and tell me about plans and i say i can go with them when they ask, but it's like i don't exist when they don't actually see me. i think they simply forget. the only people that actually try and talk to me more often are the people that are romantically interested in me, and i don't like any of them.

i don't know if it's people that leave me behind, or if it's me that i leave them behind.

my therapist says that i might have some form of autism.

117,"I am not depressed or anything by the way, but this overthinking is making me anxious and overwhelmed.

I keep thinking about every little thing that happens and I dont know what to do. Good thing is that I am only 17 years old and I am very confident about my future. 

A lot of things that happened in the past and present really bother me and make me overwhelmed. ",11Jan2019,1
118,"Hello all. 27/M here, lifelong moderate to severe depression and anxiety sufferer.


I'll cut to the chase - March 2018, after resisting medication for so long, I began taking 25mg of Valdoxan (Agomelatine) - and the results were life changing. 


I got up each day with bountiful energy, stopped playing video games every night and became a social butterfly. Went on so many good dates, became great at my jobs. Life was what it was supposed to be, and I couldn't believe how much time I had wasted needlessly suffering in the past.


Around 4 months in, I began noticing rapid hair loss. I never thought hair loss would bother me at much as it has, but it caused enough anxiety to make the medication redundant. I only found ONE reported case of alopecia induced by agomelatine use  [HERE](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24750573.2017.1338821). Other than the one reported case, it seems to be a rare side effect.  I am not taking any other prescription medications.


I discontinued the medication in September, and my hair seemed to return slowly. I managed to enjoy October and some of November without depressive symptoms, yet I now find myself at the bottom of the black hole again. The classic symptoms are back - social withdrawal, complete lack of energy, feeling like everyone hates me (even though I know it to not be true, logically at least). The only time I feel relatively normal is without a decent amount of alcohol in my system.


I reached a low point last night, and took a Valdoxan pill out of desperation. Although the medicine takes a while to build up in your system, I can already notice a difference in my energy. Hell, it's 7:30am and here I am rapidly typing this.


Has anyone else had this side effect? Is there anyway around it? I can't continue my life suffering this much for no good reason.


The other option was to begin taking Venlafaxine. The patient in the study I linked above discontinued Valdoxan and started Venlafaxine without hair loss. I've always been resistant to the idea of taking SSRIs or anything similar, but if anyone has experience with this medication I'd love to have your input.


Thank you everyone, stay strong.

119,"First of all, hi! I'm a looooooong time lurker, first time poster. I decided it was finally time to join when I was seeking communities of people who share my various quirks.

Like many people who suffer from major depression, this spiral started some time ago and continues to get progressively worse over time. I'm feeling very out of sorts and helpless... I've been seeking help from literally every outlet I can think of-- from my family doctor- to a new therapist- to medication- to self help books, and nothing seems to help. My depression is negatively impacting everything in my life. My social circle in the city I live in minuscule at best, my depression is taking a toll on my partner and our relationship, I'm finding work increasingly stressful, less enjoyable, and aggravating the issue. 

I started regularly seeing my GP again when I started having (very scary) thoughts of suicide. I was very open with her, as she was with me. We started trying new medications, but my GP fairly admitted that a psychiatrist may be a better judge. She referred me off, noting that I was having suicidal thoughts, in an effort to rush the referral. Seven weeks later, I was finally contacted, and an appointment was made for three weeks after that. I was off-put by the wait time, in the meantime I met with some new therapists to work with.
I finally met with the psychiatrist, and to put it bluntly, he was awful. He spent the entire appointment discussing how terrible he thinks men are, prescribed me a family of medications I have documented issues with (spoiler alert: it didn't help) and sent me on my way, never to be seen again. I met with my GP immediately after, expressed my disappointment, and my fears of self harm. She put me on another waitlist for a comprehensive program in my area. They were very up front about their long waits (9 months +) so I needed to do something in the meantime. No suggestion as to what, however.
Long story short, while i wait in limbo, feeling very failed by Canada's mental health system, my mental state is steadily declining. I've been trying to mitigate this with therapy for myself, and couples therapy with my partner, working with a personal trainer for fitness, being diligent about my medication, regular visits to my GP, etc... but I'm still getting worse. The other day I came up with a plan, and that really scared me. I need help, I've been asking for help from every outlet I know of, and I'm feeling forgotten or ignored.
My boyfriend and I have talked about taking me to emergency, and I'm honestly scared of either outcome. If they think I'm ""not bad enough"" and send me home, I will leave feeling more worthless than ever. If they think I should stay, I haven't stayed overnight in a hospital, and I dont know what to expect.
Have any of you done inpatient at a hospital? What can I expect? Is it worth going, or will I just be shoved aside?

TLDR; I'm struggling more than I am capable of handling with my depression and am seeking thoughts/experience/ advice on seeking inpatient therapy.

Thanks in advance. I know this is hard to talk about.
