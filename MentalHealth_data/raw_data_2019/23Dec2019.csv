Should I tell people I'm going to cut myself off from everything and social media and focus on myself? Or should I give no one a warning and let people wonder what happened?

1,"Sorry if there’s formatting issues, I’m on mobile and I don’t have any access to a computer at the moment.

I hope this is the right place to post something like this. I didn’t do too much research on this sub, I just typed in mental health and started writing this. This is also coming from a really personal place (and it’s probably not the brightest idea to post something this personal on the internet for everyone to see haha) so to anyone willing to read this I appreciate you. 

I’ve been in emotional turmoil for what’s felt like forever. I don’t want to think I have depression because I can still get happy, and I definitely don’t wanna go on any medication for depression either. However, I’m overall a really pessimistic person, especially toward myself. I am well aware that everyone at one point in time struggles with  their self-image, and if someone hasn’t then good for them honestly. Yet even though I’m self-aware with the dangers of treating yourself poorly, I still do it. There’s this voice in my head that makes me want to listen to all the negative ideas circling in my brain and give up.

It doesn’t help either that I’m a gay man and pretty self-conscious about it. I get jealous over all my straight friends for having a relationship and seeing them be happy and in love. They’ve been able to go through high-school without worrying about things that I’ve had to worry about. They now know about me being gay too, and thankfully they’re super accepting about it and treat me no different than before, but they don’t really understand why I’m upset over being gay. I’ve tried to let them know, but they brush it off and don’t take me seriously. 

Sorry for the abrupt end. There’s more I could talk about but I don’t wanna make this post super long. I don’t even know the exact purpose of this post either. I guess for a little bit of attention, honestly, and to see if there’s anyone else on here dealing with similar issues. I guess I also was looking for advice as well. 2020’s going to be the year I go off to college and I don’t want to feel like the train wreck I am now. I don’t know what else to say, so this is just gonna be it.",23Dec2019,1
2,I’m in the Walmart parking lot crying in my car for no reason or maybe a million reasons and I just need human contact but all I have is a puppy who pee’s all over the floor because I was stupid and thought a dog would cure the loneliness.

3,"How does one deal with being attracted to a prototype that’s similar to one’s childhood sexual abuser? The only template you have is one where intimacy is connected to emotional pain and self hatred. 

You go out, meet people and hope you’ll find someone attractive enough to date and get to know. And perhaps that might lead to something serious, stable and long term.

But you meet people and push yourself towards a certain type you ultimately find unattractive or unstimulating. No gains. 

Then someone else comes along who awakens what you thought was dead inside you but you realise the resemblance to your abuser physically and you’re torn. 

What are you looking for? Intimacy with your abuser? An opportunity to simulate the same experience but with you in power? Or do you want to get hurt again?",23Dec2019,1

5,"I'm afraid to call the Samaritans because of my past experience. My family has no idea what to do, they keep asking me ""whats wrong"" and ""just talk to us"" but I have no idea what to say. I see my therapist the 7th of January, so I can't talk to them.",23Dec2019,1
6,"I have posted once in here before and got a great response from my fellow redactors so here I go again.

In this past year I have been through a divorce, lost two uncles, and my father. All of this has completely changed the person I am most of the change good. Now the holidays for me don't hav the same excited, happy feeling they used to. I reflected on this earlier today and with all my friends and most of my family out of town I don't have a lot of people to talk to. So here goes... I thought back to what used to make me happy around the holidays. Aside from the obvious, I keep coming back to my past relationships. I realized, more recently, that I found happiness in making my significant other happy. This, ironically, was a major contributor to my divorce. I was sacrificing things that I really wanted for the happiness of my ex-wife. Unhealthy, I know.

So I guess my question, or what I need help with is, I wonder if making others happy is the only way I can be happy. If this way of living is unhealthy.

thanks for listening.",23Dec2019,1
7,"I am an 18-year-old artist who feels lost. I got diagnosed with severe depression around November of last year during my last year of high school. I also went to a technical high school during this time as well for Visual Communications. I loved it a lot. My main school always felt like I was locked in a place but not my technical school. Near the end of November, I got placed into a mental hospital for suicidal ideation. I went back into the hospital a week after I was released the first time for cutting myself. I also thought to myself that maybe if I went back it would help me. It sort of did but not really. Around the time I got out, I felt like I was better. Most likely because I was on antidepressants, but I didn't really enjoy taking them. I asked myself if I was okay. but I knew I really wasn't. I went back to both schools in January. I felt this might be a new start and teachers will know what I was going through to support me. Only my English teacher helped me at my main school. At my tech school, both of my teachers supported me and helped me get my grades up. I felt useless but not at the same time when I was in other classes because I knew my English teacher cared about me and pushed me towards my goal. After a while, the beginning of June arrives. Exam time. I somehow managed to pass all of them and keep my grades either exactly a 60 or above. I graduate. I felt relieved. Once I graduated I told my parents I'm going to look for a job and take a gap year till I enter community college. I am still deciding if I should. I don't want to feel stress because I can barely handle it. I don't want to feel locked in again. I had multiple jobs until now. I got let go a couple of weeks ago from a retail job.  It was temporary so I understood. I just feel like shit. I don't know what to do to make a living on something that I enjoy. I feel like if I did something that I enjoyed and made a living from it. I wouldn't be depressed and feel like shit. I feel like all the people I've known and cared about hate me. I'm not planning to kill myself or anything, I just feel useless. I can't do this because of this since it'll make me feel like this. It's like a loop. before the retail job, I was a salesperson at a kiosk. I didn't really like talking to people but I just wanted to be out of my house. So it sort of helped me be more social. I quit because I just couldn't handle the stress and I felt pressured a lot (I never had experience as a salesperson). I don't know what steps to take to get to my goal and feel better mentally. I guess that's why I'm posting here. I might post this on another subreddit. but I don't know. Thank you for reading this.",23Dec2019,1
8,"There's a person who, for around one year, hasn't done anything. No job, quit college and sits around all day. They make excuses about having no plans for the future and every single time they have ""no idea"". It's like they haven't thought about their future at all.",23Dec2019,1
9,"So I've been harassing this dude, u/Aidan884 (he has me blocked so he won't be able to see this, don't worry) Personally, I don't call it harassment although I'm fully aware that it is. We used to be friends, I was in a ""relationship"" with one of his best friends. Yeah, as you can fucking tell it did not go too well. But before that, I was still obsessed with Aidan. I don't know why. I don't have feelings for him romantically, only sexually. I was in denial about that for awhile though. I was 16 when we first all met, now I'm 18.

 A lot have changed, at least with me. I have OCD, I know that but what I don't know is really why I'm still attached like this. Even after everything, I still think about him. I still stalk his social media, I still fuck with him, I still try to contact him. **I don't mean any harm, I don't want to hurt him although I'm completely aware I am.** It's just..  I don't know? I really don't. I think about us having sex, though there's really nothing connecting with him for me to continue being latched on like this. He kinda looks like a twinky hipster and that style turns me on. I'm not sex-crazy either, I'm a very asocial person. I'm not attached to the sexual aspect of him. He's nothing new, most likely nothing special. So, I find myself thinking ""why him?"". 

I don't want to be obsessed with anyone, honestly. I am not a people-person. I like my alone time, though I acknowledge that's not always healthy. If i lived near him in person, I don't think I'd *actually* stalk him. Maybe pass down the street and pick on him, but that's it. A lot of what I do is playing jokes on him and poking fun. Some jokes are a bit on the harsher side, still funny nevertheless. I like seeing him angry, it's cute because a lot of what he says is bluff and empty threats. I remember the time where he said he would ""expose me"" and shit- that shits adorable. Aidan, in general, is just an adorable little kid despite  being one year older than me. 



I have tried to stop and at one point I did. Then for whatever reason, I started to contact him again (because I'm a fucking idiot). I know coping skills to help me stop, but by now I'm so deep into it. It doesn't help that I have other issues to worry about AND I'm still trying to overcome grief due to shit happening in my life. 2019 is the best year of my life so far, yet DAMN. Lost so many people. With each improvement there's another loss. It sucks though I'm grateful to come this far, and I wanna keep going. 

I don't know what to do to fix things. Becoming his friend again doesn't seem like an option, and I don't talk that much anyways unless it's to meet up OFFLINE or if it's one of my closer friends. So idk how simply ""becoming friends"" would do anything, besides make me more withdrawn and feeling whatever. I'm lonely as hell. Using mindfulness is also iffy, what is there to focus on? I'm always so tired and occupied by art projects, it burns me out. It would be problematic to put ALL of my focus on them. my other hobbies ain't much and some are complicated due to other issues. I outta leave him along, just don't know what to do.

Sorry if this post doesn't make much sense. I'm exhausted, ready to sleep at any minute. Advice would be helpful, as for any resources.",23Dec2019,1
10,"I’m going to get my first ever mental health assessment in a few weeks so I can get properly diagnosed btw but I was wondering about whether I’ve experienced dissociation before. 

A lot of times when I’m experiencing an intense emotion (such as a mood dip involving anger/anxiety/depression) or when I’m having a panic attack, I have an intense feeling of suddenly being disconnected from my body or like I’m floating outside of my body. The emotions are still happening and I’m feeling them intensely but somehow I also feel zoned out like I’m separate from them like I’ve turned down the volume by zoning out somehow??? This is separate but sometimes co-occurring with feelings of the whole world being fake and surreal or feelings that I am not real, which are other common things I experience during intense emotions.  

(Cw: suicide) Also at one point a few years ago, I woke up more depressed than I’d ever been in my life (and that’s saying something) and my mind was like “you’re gonna kill yourself today” and the rational part of my brain that should have been terrified by this felt distant and I was okay with the idea I was going to kill myself. 

During this, I felt *NOTHING* and I felt completely empty. In the back of my mind I had a dull feeling of being depressed, but I also felt calm. Anything I did feel felt distant and I cut off from it like it was there but I couldn’t really feel it. 

I legitimately felt like I was a person other than myself or that a person other than me was controlling my body and the whole world felt slow and fake and surreal. I was dimly aware that this wasn’t true but my brain was 95% taken over by this idea and I couldn’t shake the feeling. I also had the INTENSE feeling that I was watching myself from outside of my body. All this continued INTENSELY for about 20 minutes while I got ready for work before I abruptly shifted out of it and then I was just utterly terrified by what had just happened. 

Do both/either of those things sound like dissociation and if not, what do you think would be the best term to describe them?",23Dec2019,1
11,"I’m hoping this is the right subreddit. 

I used to be very overweight and very self conscious about it. I used to really try to rail into myself by saying I was fat to try to get people to say it less. I used to make myself puke after eating too much because I was ashamed. 

Well...3 years ago I started going to the gym. I enjoyed it! I was having fun sweating and feel my muscles swell from the blood pumping to them. I got into really good shape, and dropped about 40 lbs and would consider myself “skinny”

This year I got to the “scrawny” point and decided “you know? I’ve been pretty consistently skinny for a few years I’m gonna try to add on some mass!” So that’s what I did! I started eating a lot more calories (mostly good calories) but because of that I have gained a little more fat along with some more muscle. 

Yesterday at a family party my sister (who struggles with anorexia herself) called me fat...I took it as a joke but when I got home I looked at myself in the mirror and I saw that I was fat again. 

My girlfriend has been nothing but supportive since I told her saying “this is what you wanted! You’re gaining more muscle you’ll drop the extra in no time!” And assures me that she knows it’s hard and discouraging but I’ve worked so hard for 3 years I can’t give up now. 

For 3 years I was happy with myself. With my body. With who I was becoming as a person. Yesterday it all got thrown away. I’ve already considered not eating and throwing up the stuff I’ve already eaten but I know I can’t because I never want to be that again...1 small comment ruined me and I’m so scared",23Dec2019,1

i feel like i need to go back because my symptoms are getting increasingly worse and i dont wanna get on medication. i know i need to but i hate this whole situation and everything and admitting i need help and all that. i dont know how to go about this. i feel so bad too, my girlfriend really wants me to but i just cant. idk what to do",23Dec2019,1
13,"For the past few months my brain has been bombarded with images of a recent event and my physical reactions are suffocating me.

My father, who has always had an incredibly short fuse, attacked my mother out of nowhere this July, and my mind just keeps flashing back to the image of him towering over her, of his yelling and my mother shouting at him in protest until she went deathly quiet, realizing how much danger she was in. He did not hit her, but that night was the very first time I'd seen my mother cry like that. Me, her, my brother and our three dogs locked ourselves in my parents' bedroom for four hours that evening. My father did not leave the house to let us relax, he simply sat in the kitchen, scrolling through Facebook on his phone with his usual stern expression as if nothing even happened. My mother told me he's always been this way, ever since they first got together 23 years ago, she also told me he was worse back then, as he was deep into alcoholism. Still, he'd always been this way. Snapping and then sweeping it under the rug, surprised that she was still even thinking about it. At how sensitive we are.  
My mother told me she wasn't going to forgive him so easily this time. That he had to change, but of course he didn't. My mother forgave him a week after and seeing my father glued to her and being so much more touchy than before made me nauseous, and that had never happened before. It disgusts me that he dares to act in such a way. The first few weeks after the incident, I felt sick and on extreme alert just being in the same room as my father. I avoided him like the raging fire he had always been.

So those were my first reactions to this incident, but instead of leaving me, the memories instead have been growing more intense. They keep intruding my mind when I'm just trying to go about my day. They attack when I'm joking around with my friends, when my mind is nowhere near my father. It's been five months and I've just a few minutes ago had yet another one of these episodes. The images I get are so piercingly loud, and I feel the exact fear I felt in that moment each time it comes back to me. My stomach knotting up tighter than I thought possible, a gag inducing ball in my throat that feels like it just might suffocate me, the stiffness of my shoulders and the uncomfortable tingle of adrenaline flooding through my thighs, preparing me to run far, far away from the nonexistent danger. It happens every god damn time I even think about my father and what happened.   


It wasn't the first time I'd seen him like this, I can't even count the amount of times he's snapped at me like that, how many times I've feared he might beat me to death when he corners me, his face a thunderstorm and his eyes empty of all logical thinking. It's strange how different it affects me to see him act this way to my mother. Somehow, seeing it from an outside perspective makes it all so much more real, which is confusing as hell to think about. I was so terrified that he would punch my mother, that I would find her lying battered and bruised in that corner he'd enclosed her in. God I don't even know where the fuck I'm going with this post. I've never posted anything on Reddit before, but somehow it came to mind that I could write my thoughts here. I don't know if this is trauma. I don't want to call this something that it isn't, but it just feels like I'm being choked. The fear is suffocating and it drains me of all my energy. That is something I've noticed over the past few months. Just how exhausting constant fear is, both physically and mentally. I just want to feel relaxed in my own home. I just want these memories to leave me the fuck alone. It's humiliating when it starts while I'm around other people, how my mind gets cloudy and I can't hear the outside world anymore. My thoughts get so loud I can't even hear my own breathing, so I breathe faster, try to get air into my lungs, past the rock in my throat. I start to feel faint from hyperventilating, can't feel my legs anymore due to the intense rush of adrenaline. I start pinching myself, making deep scratches in my hands to try and remind myself that the outside world still exists, that I'm still awake, that I'm still standing there looking ridiculous in front of everyone. I'm so fucking tired of being out of control of my own mind.   
Would this be considered trauma? Because I myself don't fucking know how to answer that.",23Dec2019,1
14,"What an emotionally taxing day. Spoiler alert, she’s awake and alive and in good physical health! And for that, I could sob. My mom is the person who kept me alive physically and she’s been the rock who has supported me unconditionally my entire life. She’s got a huge mess of mental fog and can’t really remember anything solidly at the moment, even from 30 seconds ago in a conversation. 

I know her scans all came back clear. I know there was no damage. But I can’t even begin to articulate how deep the grief has been. She didn’t recognize me when she woke up. It took her hours to even make eye contact. We still don’t know for sure what’s happening. Now there may be something wrong with her kidneys? She’s never even had kidney issues!

This is all just to say that I hate this. I hate this more than I could hate anything in the entire world. I’m in this weird mix of grateful and at peace and terrified and stressed and a million other things. I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression and a myriad of other mental health issues and I don’t know how to navigate this world without her.

She will be ok. I will be ok. I love her so much. Sorry to ramble. I just need some weird tlc and empathy. Thank you all.",23Dec2019,1
15,"I'm Chinese and I was born premature so I've always been relatively short and skinny with super high metabolism. Which is great and all but people always guilt trip me or make me feel like shit for being skinny. But since that's also the #1 compliment I got, I would go through these time periods where I would just starve myself because I wanted to be as skinny as I could be. So I wouldn't eat for days, I would just snack on an apple once in a few days or some cookies (the sugar would give me a little more energy).  So I became super anemic and barely had any energy to walk.  

So I hate when people talk about how jealous they are of how skinny I am/was, especially then because it just validated my unhealthy behavior. What's super annoying is the people who always say how jealous they are of how skinny I am are my friends that should REMEMBER how I used to starve myself but I guess its unimportant now and I should just be thankful I'm skinny. 

So please do NOT comment on a person's weight, regardless of if they seem skinny or obese or somewhere in between.",23Dec2019,1
16,"I know its a weird question but I have been wondering what went wrong with me and the only link ive found so far is that I changed a lot by the time my wisdom teeth grew. 

I always used to be introvert and a very peaceful person and somehow I lost myself and i cant tell where. 

Many factors coudlve caused it maybe my brain just grew into that ugly person I am now. I know I took some bad stuff during gym obsession period but I already was way different than the kind me. 


I am wondering if my wisdom teeth growing up but not having enough space could have somehow changed my jaw and have it pushing on my temples. Like some sort of non stopping pain that I have learned to live with but would be applying constant pressure on the temples and could cause all this. I know its some sort of a stretch but I really feel the timeline matches and i know for sure that my jaw is not at its initial position as a feel it and it cracks everytime I close my mouth after opening it. 

For the info the Teeth are out, not in the right direction but they have been out for many years if say almost 7 now. 

I have not tried looking that way but im at a all time low and I figured i might try to look for answers before I do something stupid.

17,"This will be a bit rambly, blubbering about my first world problems. I'm just really fucking lost. I have undiagnosed adhd, I've been on the waiting list for a formal assessment for over a year now. I'm looking to go back into therapy (low cost) in the new year as I really need any support I can get. I've moved back to my parents isolated house after dropping out of uni at the end of my second year, and I'm constantly worried about regressing back into mirroring their toxic behaviours. I did so much work in therapy and with like minded people at uni, now I feel like I'm failing and it's evident that I am the family failure as all I'm ever asked about is if I have a job yet and being shouted at to wake up earlier and stop being lazy when they don't understand what executive dysfunction is. These are things I'm working on. I'm doing my best to not let them get to me. Everyone in my family works full time so I hardly ever get a chance to have a conversation with them, and when I do it feels like I'm a burden because I eat into their chillout time, or it's clear that theyre not interested in what I'm talking about, or visa versa. It's like living with a bunch of strangers who are super invasive.

The job will come in the new year too so once I have enough money to move back to the city I will. But then there's my brain... As a component of adhd my memory is the fucking worst. I'm constantly confused when I'm being told off for forgetting something my partner is adament they've said a few sentences ago, and I have absolutely no recollection. At the same time, there are sometimes things Im almost certain him or myself has said, but when I bring it up to correct them or counteract a point, not only am I challenged but I'm shut down because I've admitted I don't remember things correct sometimes. I trust my partner would never intentionally lie and he does tend to remember things well. Basically I can't trust my brain, but what kind of fucking life is it when you remember something that happened moments ago clear as day and you're being told by someone without memory problems that you're wrong. It's so painful forever having your reality flipped upside down. What's the point in even trying? 

My emotions are not in check. I do my best to regulate them and do controlled breathing exercises, and I feel I do quite well, especially in comparison to a year or so ago, but when my hormones start going mad around my time of the month, it's super difficult to not raise my voice when someone else is, or not break down and start crying, or if I'm being pushed - spiral into hitting myself in the head, hard. I hate that I feel the overwhelming urge to do this as I know this just causes concussion and worsens my brain further. I used to cut but I had to stop that, I've done it on and off since I was 12. I never truly want to die, I just want the pain to stop, or a distraction, something to alleviate it. I suffer with intrusive thoughts which I've only recently realised is a component of my mild ocd, which I feel could actually be worse than I was initially told about, on further research. My brain constantly torments itself. I also (secretly) suffer with retroactive jealously. It's something I'm working on to overcome.

I suffer with acne, again, probably partially hormonal, but I'm also gluten interant and have ibs. I'm still figuring out what my trigger foods are. Acne makes me feel disgusting. I have so many scars and it flares up whenever I eat something... Normal? I know gluten was a massive contributor, but I need to do an allergy test to see what else is upsetting my body. I was vegan up until very recently, but I was making myself ill from restricting myself even further, so I had to put my strong morals/beliefs aside and reintroduce fish into my diet. Eating causes me so much stress - I'd eat all day if I could. It's one of the things that gives me a nice dose of serotonin for my deprived adhd brain. Plus I'm underweight and really need to put more on, but it doesn't stay. My parents constantly tell me how skinny I am, yet my mum complains about how expensive my free from foods are when if I eat regular stuff I will be super sick. 

Moreover, I feel like such a dull person in comparison to my partner and two best friends. They are all people who have suffered big childhood traumas, and despite being somewhat broken people, they're all intelligent and interesting, they have detailed interests, things I've never even heard of before, things I'm interested in learning about but everyones ahead of me. I know I shouldn't let it discourage me but it's hard. One friend is 9 months older, the other is 2 years older, and my partner is 10 years older. I'm aware this is a big contributing factor to me feeling far behind and lower than the rest of them. It certainly seems like my partner and best friend are so similar in their past and interests that they'd make a great couple. I'm not weird about this in any way, genuinely, I love them both with the whole of my heart, but the more I see them hang out the more I feel guilty for not being a more interesting or worldly wise woman. He needs a real, adult woman with personality, who's humble and stands in their integrity, who has experienced at least a bit of the world. I'm not even a woman, I'm a child with attitude/hormone issues, a fucked brain that can't retain information or remember what's important, I don't have the capacity to fully consider my partner like you should do in an adult relationship. I'm so self absorbed. I'm so easily overwhelmed. I find it hard contributing to conversations with my friends, and when I do have something to say it usually comes out shit because my ADHD brain doesn't let me process my thoughts properly before I blurt it out, especially if we're in a coffee shop where there's music and talking and noise as I get sensory overload and can't hear myself think.

Basically. I'm a mess. Im not a person of substance, I'm weak mentally and physically, I'm constantly reminded what a dissapointment I am by my family, and when I get away from them I'm reminded of how much of a child I still am around my closest people. I disassociate constantly to protect myself from all of this bullshit pain which just amplifies my issues. And I think I've ruined Christmas too. I really don't like myself.",23Dec2019,1
18,"This is my first time posting to this subreddit. I was wondering if y'all could help me figure out what this might be or maybe be related to.

So whenever I have to use the restroom (ie pee), I usually have to go right away and can't hold it comfortably for long. Whenever I can't reach a restroom right away like if I'm driving or in the middle of a class lecture, I have an intense urge to cause pain to myself in some way to distract from the urge to pee. I'll pull out hair from my head, scratch at my scalp, forearms, and ankles until raw, pick at scabs and acne on my face, bite my fingers and forearms, and if my hair is in a ponytail, I'll squeeze and tug on it a lot. 

Because of this tendency, the hair closest to my forehead is short and scraggly at one side (the side I usually pull on) and I get bruises and scabs from the biting and scratching. 

Its very embarrassing for me and has made road trips pretty difficult. I've talked to my therapist briefly about it and have tried stress balls before. 

I mainly just want to know what this distructive behavior may come from.

Some history about my health is that I've had a tendency to pick at scabs since I was very young tho it has mellowed out a lot since my elementary school days. I also have ADHD and anxiety.
During the 5th grade (when I was about 10) I had a very bad infection with strep which made me feel like I had to pee every 5 minutes. It took a few years for me to fully recover from this and might still be affected by it to this day and may be the reason I can't wait long if I have to pee.

i am a 16 yr old who has been struggling with severe depression and anxiety since around the age of 10. i have been on antidepressants for as long as i can remember. i was on prozac for years with no noticeable changes after increasing my amount to as much as i could have. in 2016 i went to a PHP and they added buspar to the prozac and that seemed to be working well until it wasnt. i had a suicide attempt in june of 2017 and that hospital put me on lexapro. lexapro made me the worst person you could ever meet. i was put onto zoloft when we realized the lexapro was the cause of my sudden behavioral issues. at the start of 2019, we added buspar with my zoloft because i felt that buspar had worked the most for me at the time. as of now i am still on buspar &amp; zoloft. 

i dont quite know how to describe my relationship with medications. i’ve always known these pills werent “cures” so i always assumed me still feeling so sad on these medications were normal. i struggle with the question of if my medications are working because i truly believe i have yet to find a medication that works, so i dont know what it feels like.

within the last few months i’ve pondered with the idea that maybe i have treatment resistant depression &amp; i’d like to hear other peoples experiences. i am still severely depressed and live with constant suicidal ideations. is this what it feels like for a medication to work? do you still feel suicidal on meds? i have been in PHP 3 times and an inpatient ward once. i have had one suicide attempt that was treated &amp; that my family knows about, but the amount of times i ive done things hoping to die and just ended up waking up the next day are too many to count. the its like every time i believe my medication is working, and maybe the do for a little but the thoughts always return stronger than before. 

im reaching out because i need to start advocating for myself and taking my treatment into my own hands. my psychiatrist is a WEIRD ASS dude and i have 0 trust in him despite being with him for years. i plan to talk to my mom about getting a new one. within the past week, i have been consumed to suicidal thoughts and at my lowest point every single night. someone please help me understand if this is how im meant to feel.",23Dec2019,1

I just got a new job, a really good one with benefits, and my family told me they are proud of me, but it feels like I'm constantly one step away from screwing everything up.

21,"Hi y’all I’m 17 years old and recently my two good friends have said they notice I have been ticking ( popping my shoulders up n down) sometimes the last two times I have drunk, I have never noticed this before and find it strange that this would happen due to drinking. I do smoke weed occasionally but have never noticed the tick before along with all my best friends and family. Also I drank a lot last time at a bar and I was told that I was starring into my female friends eyes for 5 mins (no exaggeration) without saying a word. This seems like very strange behaviour even tho I may be drunk, I am just worried this may be due to an underlying mental health issue I am unaware off. Also I had a very intense acid trip not long ago it wasn’t bad but it was intense and the next day I had a very very extreme hallucination that kinda scarred me.  If any of u could help me out bu trying to explain some of this behaviour it would be greatly appreciated. In my sober mind I feel completely fine which is why I’m so worried about this.

25,"I'm hoping to find some people who are able to help give some advice with an issue that has been persistent in my family for 15 or so years.

In brief, based in the UK I'm in my late 20s &amp; had a fairly stable upbringing until around 2003ish.. essentially my farther had some traumatic experiences while serving in the military &amp; came back a changed man. In the beginning after he came back it was very bad &amp; in my mind clearly some form of PTSD but one which my farther was unable or unwilling to get professional support with.. he has improved since those days but in the years that have followed he has gone through good times but the effects on him from this period have seen him change, he struggles with stress, even traveling in a car &amp; taking directions can set him off yelling &amp; to my understanding he doesn't comprehend what he's doing at these times.  He's constantly verbally abusive to my mum, &amp; really sometimes you can see a crazed look in his eye where no matter what you say you can't get through to him.

Fairly soon after this traumatic event he left the military &amp; he has found it hard to hold down a job since having now has spent nearly a decade unemployed &amp; has had to retire early due to this as he can't cope with basic tasks without taking umbrage at perceived injustices (as an example: I remember one time he offered to do a BBQ for my aunt's birthday &amp; ended up having an argument because someone asked for a sausage in the wrong way for him).

He has had paranoid delusions that one of our neighbors was a spy watching him &amp; has even said to me that he would be killed by the government if he got therapy.. We have spoken to him about getting help but he has refused point blank for the last 15 years. Now he's getting on but still only early 60s but coming home this Christmas he has really worried me, rambling about things, which much less clarity than he used to not really making sense &amp; very quick to fly into a rage much like back in 2003.

I'm worried for my mother to be living with this stress of what at this stage is an abusive partner, but one she still loves &amp; doesn't want to abandon.. 

I don't know how to even approach the situation anymore &amp; how I can get my dad the help he needs..

27,"Hi Reddit.

I don't really know how to start but well.. I need your opinion concerning my current situation, as well as my story as a whole, as well as some advice in order to help me continue my life.

So, I have psycho-somatic disorders and have stress/anxiety problems, and am potentially hypersensitive. I stress really easily and feel tense all the time, especially in my muscles. My brain runs at 1000mp/h and can't stop overthinking. I have background music (my playlist) constantly running in my head in the background since 4 years. I'm overly stimulated by what I feel, see and hear. I can get easily upset and my mood shifts extremely quickly. Moreover, I'm really hard on myself and I hate upsetting people and hate failure so much. I can be tormented by something bad for long periods. 

Furthermore, I need guidance for almost everything. My brain is really weird. I'm good at storing information but it's just so hard hard for me to think for myself (fact is, I love history and hate math), even to the point of having sometimes people tell me ""Do I really have to tell you everything every time? You're a grown-up"". It's such a weird situation that I have this habit of simulating potential future events in order to avoid an error 404 and crashing, especially that I'm a really slow thinker. When I was younger, I had this weird feeling that I was different and that I could struggle going into adulthood. Right I was. Just when I was transitioning into adulthood, I caused myself and others harm without knowing it (read story below), which shook me so much it almost killed my self-esteem. So, each time I'm in a new situation, I do my best to seek advice first. As time goes by, I start thinking for myself but it's hard. This is my story:

It all began when my Mom suddenly died. I was just a pre-teen back then. Cried as much as I could; tried fast to move on. I was extremely dependent on her and she was suddenly gone. The following months were fine as we moved on. However, subconsciously, I was still shook to the core without knowing it, which caused me having some inexplicable feelings, turned out way later to be psychosomatic disorders. I'm not really into society, quite introverted, but when I'm given the opportunity, I can talk non stop. But at that time I didn't really have friends. Still, my family was always there for me. Nevertheless, after some difficult moments, I managed to move on, especially after making friends. I had a really wonderful period as a teenager, filled with positivity (I'm a really negative person by nature) and just think about my hobbies. This really slowed down the progression of this thing.

When I went to University, my closest friends moved out to study in other cities. This is when anxiety started to really kick in. The following summer was difficult. I began having this weird tense feeling in my muscles. I became easily irritated and would stress quickly. Still, it was at that time that I knew what was going on. After years of wondering why I was like that, I knew I had psychosomatic disorders. The problem is that I didn't do much to stop that and was pretty lazy about it.

In the end of the summer, I caused harm to two people. I had a brief relationship and ruined it right away, and momentarily ruined my friendship with my best friend. I basically went from heaven to hell in the space of a week. It hurt me so much to realize that I hurt such wonderful people. I spent the following months doing basically nothing but surviving. Thanks to friends, I managed to turn things around and I was forgiven. Still, my personal self esteem was just crushed to smithereens. My academic ambition was the same, but personal one, I just felt so vulnerable and weak.

The following year was a really good one, went abroad to continue my studies and was well surrounded, even managed to better my mental health. However, I had to move out again, to a place I didn't like, where I would sometimes spend weeks without enjoying anything. I began having problems with stress, sometimes I would stress days non stop. It continues to this day but it's a bit better.

I'm just super lucky to have people around me who understand me. My friends and family try their best and I just can't be thankful enough to them.

So, as I'm soon having my first real professional experience, I'm really afraid of having another breakdown. And if there's someone who has similar problems, I want to hear from you.

Thanks.",23Dec2019,1

36,"Hi. So I recently found out that my partner of 3 months (23 M) has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. He’s never clearly stated it before, but we got into a discussion about mental health while hanging with his one friend as well. He stated that he’s heard voices before in the past, mainly angry, yelling ones, but not as much in the recent year or so. Although, he told me his conscience sometimes “talks to him,” or that his late friend talks to him. He has frequent anxiety attacks, which he often says his thoughts are “uncontrollable” and he feels impending doom. From what he’s saying, these voices that he does hear aren’t commanding anything from him, and he’s usually able to differentiate what is real and what is not. He states he doesn’t have hallucinations or delusions. For him, he’s mostly struggling with the paranoia. He doesn’t trust authority, mainly cops, and gets extremely anxious out in public. He also has extreme paranoia around me leaving him and our relationship. It often leads our simple misunderstandings into a downward spiral. Our conversations usually have flow to them, but I often find him going off into tangents and it’s sometimes hard to bring him back. I’ve also noticed his personal hygiene and self care deteriorating over the few months we’ve been together. He stated he was on medication and going to therapy years ago, but stopped. He doesn’t want to go back onto medication.  He stated he’s now feeling better than he ever has, and hasn’t self-harmed in over 6 months. 
I, 1.) don’t want to trigger him in our daily life, &amp; 2.) am worried about this progressing.

43,"Hi! I'm new here. Not quite sure how reddit works  yet but I'm making an attempt haha. Figured I'd post here to get some insight or advice for my current predicament.

So, I'm generally a pretty caring/genuine guy when it comes to friends or relatively nice people. I'll go out of my way to help them if they ever needed it, check up on them from time to time or hear them out if they ever needed to vent. It's such a rewarding feeling when you make a positive impact. 

However, lately I've begun to notice that I'll very rarely receive the same treatment back. At the end of the day, I'm glad I could help/be there for someone. But when the going gets tough for me, I really only have myself, which isn't a particularly positive experience most of the time. And it's tough dealing with it alone, I won't lie. I would reach out, but I also worry I'll be placing too much emotional baggage on people or that they'd see me differently. Sometimes my depression will even cause me to worry or overthink that I'm just being used solely for my kindness, which is something I'd hate to think about.  

Is there anyone out there who's had similar feelings/experiences with this sort of thing? I'd love to know I'm not alone in feeling this way.

44,"I apologize in advance; this is not an issue related to poor mental health. It's more along the lines of me resorting to Reddit due to not wanting to share my thoughts with anyone else. 

So about five months ago this girl was all over me, and I was very much into her as well. However, I was going off to college and she was moving out of town, so we would have been between 40 and 250 miles apart the majority of the time. This wouldn't have been THAT bad on its own, but she was also underage for another year (I was a young 18, she was 16) and I didn't want to risk anything. I told her these things and we are still friends to this day. 

About two months later, however, she started taking to another guy. I supported and even encouraged them, and eventually they started dating. Unfortunately, this hit me harder than I expected. They're having a great time, and I'm happy for them, but boy am I jealous. This isn't constant, but I have occasional spells where I get super sad about the whole thing.

I look at a certain shade of carpet, and again, I’m home. Everyone I see resembles a member of my family. I’m not hallucinating, but in those moments, I cannot distinguish reality. The whole thing also generally comes with a large dose of panic.",23Dec2019,1
46,"I've never actually, properly dealt with this. Never truly understood what all happened and why, and what impact it truly has had on me.

When I was young, maybe 8 to 10 or so, I (male) was molested by an older (female) member of my family. From what I'm able to recall at least. I call out gender because as a male, I feel we're often under represented in terms of abuse and its impact. Often made to feel I couldn't be a victim. That it's a men abusing women problem. Maybe I'm over sensitive and wrong on that point, but I digress... That's not the issue.

I started binge watching Mr Robot. Minor spoiler alert... I connected with the show because I'm a tech guy and work in IT. I didn't realize the show was going to take a dark turn to childhood sex abuse being the center of the main character's struggle. And much like his, my struggle had been pushed down, hidden and suppressed. And much like him, I wonder if my mental depression and unnecessary social anxiety, and feeling of low self worth is a result of the abuse. I did not ask or expect this to all come rushing back.

I had a meltdown after I watched an episode of the show, where the abuse and its effects were revealed, and my wife found me crying. I felt ashamed and didn't know what to say. What good is it exposing my abuser at this point? It's only going to cause me more stress. It's only going to tear apart family who is otherwise at peace. 

I often wonder if I would be different were it not for the abuse. During my youngest school age memories I was very popular and had a lot of fun. Had plenty of friends. I was very comfortable with myself and around others.

Then after what I can remember of abuse, I was detached and my shyness and quiet turned into me being the unpopular quiet kid in the background. That turned into a childhood and teenage years of feeling unwelcome and unliked. Why the change? Was it just how I changed and who I am, naturally? Or was it the abuse turning me into a socially anxious and detached person?

How do I know my social issues aren't my own and not a result of mental issues from abuse? How do I know I was truly even impacted by those events?

And do I still need to seek help all these years later? Is this why I'm a depressive mess or is it just me?

And why am I so afraid and shy to talk about it?",23Dec2019,1

So I have been diagnosed with ADD, PTSD, depression, and anxiety. All of which I understand and have been living with for a while now, only just getting on medication this year. 

However, I have this weird thing with food that I don’t know what’s causing it. Whenever I eat a baked good like a cookie or brownie and it’s soft, I get this sick feeling in my stomach and I immediately want to put it down and never eat anything like it again. 

Most people talk about how much they love a warm gooey chocolate chip cookie, but whenever I eat one I feel like I’m going to barf. I know it’s not the taste because if I eat a crunchy cookie I don’t get the same reaction.

49,"TLDR: Grew up in a very anti-mental health home.  Have had some things happened to me in my life. I've have anger outbursts &amp; general anger for no reason, constant worrying and fear of something bad happening, anxiety episodes out of nowhere, and I was at one point a compulsive liar. 

Grew up in a home where mental health was not for Men. I was told to suck it up. Very pro fighting: kid threw a snowball and hit the car in 8th grade so Mom pulled over and made me fight all three kids by myself, told me I was a man and needed to defend her. I had some sexual abuse when I was about 9 or 10. My uncle dressed me up as a girl (stockings, skirt, wig, make up etc.) and molested me several times when I stayed at his house. Never told anyone but my wife.

I had some heavy drug use when I was 19-22 with speed, experimented in the gay community and with crossdressing with older men. Not much more to tell there, I think I was recreating my abuse. Eventually moved on from it and lost interest sort of? I still have some issues here but I've handled it well and done a lot of self work. 

Since I was 13 or so I developed this compulsive lying trait. It wasn't until I met my wife that I stopped. I fought mentally for a long time to tell the truth because it was important to me to be honest with her. This was hard because telling lies was my first response- be it for attention, deflecting attention, entertaining others, entertaining myself, etc. 

I've had issues with coming to terms with possible mental health issues for a long time. I'm still unsure of what to think/believe but the random anxiety (heart racing, heightened sensitivity, uneasiness), inability to focus, and anger (which has decreased greatly over the years as it's been a big focus of mine- I no longer have outbursts really but I feel the same anger/rage at times) has become too much at times.

I either get like 2 hours of sleep or 12 and there’s usually no in between or regular sleep pattern. I am extremely paranoid and worried about things that don’t even necessarily make sense like i always have to step out of a room before turning the light off, I worry about spending any money at all and worry about other people spending money. I can’t trust anyone and always cancel plans just to sit in my room at home because i think something bad is going to happen to me. I freak out about my boyfriend being friends with any girls, we’ve been together for 2 years and he’s never done anything to make me not trust him. 
Now for about the past month there’s been 3 times i’ve seen things that weren’t there. Once i was at work and saw someone in a closet who wasn’t there. It wasn’t scary just weird because i swear they were there. Next i was driving at around 11 at night and saw someone trying to hitchhike on a country road by my house and later realized there’s no way someone would be doing that. This morning i was driving and saw myself driving my car on the other side of the road.

I have this fear that I am just a copy of myself from another life, like my true self is perfectly normal while i’m an alter who is going to die in some terrible way and i’m just waiting for that to happen. 
I also get urges to wreck my car while i’m driving on the interstate, but i’ve never heard any voices telling me to do it. 
I don’t shower for weeks at a time, or i’ll only wash my hair once every two weeks because i’m so demotivated",23Dec2019,1
51,"Like the title says, I spent 2019 in and out of the hospital, suicidal, rock-bottom depressed and suffering anywhere from 10-30 panic attacks per day.  I missed weeks of work and was barely able to get out of bed or even perform routine self-care like brushing my teeth. 

I was fortunate enough to have access to therapy, as I found a truly wonderful counselor that operates on a sliding scale and just happened to have an opening. Therapy truly, 100%, saved my life.  Had I not had access to mental healthcare as well as a support system of my friends and partner, I guarantee you I would not be here right now. 

To end 2019 on a high note, I decided to create the [Raise Your Hand Project](http://raiseyourhandproject.com) to battle the stigma surrounding mental illness by creating online, global support groups for those affected by a psychological disorder(s).

**In the long-term**, the goal is to offer sponsorships to those who need therapy/counseling/mental health services and can't afford it.  

I'd love some feedback, comments, suggestions. I *really* want to make it something worthwhile. 

&amp;#x200B;

Note: I'm using an alternate account from what I usually do, as I have some friends/family on here who I have yet to share my mental health status with and I'd like to do that in person (this is an account I made when I temporarily couldn't get into my regular one, if that matters)",23Dec2019,1

Whether it be big or small, he just constantly lies &amp; I have called him out on it multiple times. Just recently, I have noticed that if you text or video chat or hangout with him, and you say anything about yourself or tell him about something that’s happened to you recently, he will either ignore it or say something completely irrelevant. I’m just wondering if this is a psychological issue? I truly believe he needs help, but he’s been to therapy and has lied to them too. It’s obvious that he lacks sympathy, I just wonder if anyone else has gone through something similar &amp; has any advice on helping him realize he is wrong.

56,"I kind of left the church for a couple years now. I was a sophomore in high school and my parents didn't take it well for a while. At first they wanted to force me but eventually they just left me alone about it. 

Based on what I know, have seen and heard, I'm scared of the things in the world. My father is a pastor and he tells me things that sometimes make me anxious. It's hard to explain but he's said that prayer can help me and part of this (so he says) is from lack of prayer. He has a stool analogy. Each leg is a thing (meds, therapy, prayer, and exercise). That I can't get better without all. But the way he puts it and says things sometimes makes it seem like all of this is spiritual, even though he claims he understands that it is also medical/psychological. First, my grandma is trying to ruin me (which is for another post bc it's just so messed and the worst part is that things add up), then it has to do with me inching away from religion. Long story short, apparently my grandma wants to kill me/ruin me as a sacrifice because she meant to use my mom but then my mom married a pastor and took her chance away so I'm the next best thing. Crazy right? And it's weird because she's constantly trying to turn me against my father but anyway sometimes this knowledge makes me worse. Whether it's true or not, if a mentally unstable person is told that their last grandparent wants them dead for evil reasons, wouldn't anyone not want to live in such a world? Honestly, my life is like the movie Hereditary in a way. 

And just now when I tried talking to my parents about how I felt like sticking a knife into a socket, he became obviously irritated and said very sternly ""If you're considering suicide, I'm calling."" He says I'm not doing my part bc this is the third year I'm dealing with this and it's only supposed to be short term (God said I won't deal with this for long). The thing is, I know my dad and he's not a zealous foolish person, but sometimes it really seems like he can't truly take this seriously and the religious side takes over the medical side. He gets frustrated or shrugs when I talk about how I'm feeling. Then wonders why I can't comfortably go to him about how I'm feeling",23Dec2019,1
57,"In the last month, I have been randomly having intense waves of rage hit me at the drop of a hat. I got annoyed on Thanksgiving when someone threw a pillow at my face and when someone put a hand on my shoulder, I threw it off with a LOT of force that came out of nowhere. Last night I threatened someone for patronizing me. These are both people that I love very much! When the words were coming out I could only feel this really intense inexplicable dark anger and couldn't help myself. At this point I just want to isolate myself to prevent any further outbursts.

I’m on mobile so sorry if the formatting is a bit crappy.  It’s like I have two “voices” in my head.  One of them is clearly my own thoughts, things that are in the first person perspective (“I want to go to the beach”, “I should put the laundry out”, ect.)

But then there’s the other one, and it feels like a constant shouting match in my head.  I’m always referred to as “you” or by my name in these thoughts which make me feel a bit confused.  It’s often like “you are a piece of shit”, “why can’t you do anything right”, “you should kill yourself” very rude and mean tbh.  It seems like as soon as I try to disagree with it by thinking “no, that’s wrong” it just gets even more overwhelming and meaner.

at this point idk what to do. i feel so guilty for all of this and selfish for wanting to be alone but i cant help it. my mom keeps telling me how much stress me not being happy or like excited rn gives her and it makes me feel even worse. i even feel insane typing this all out cause i keep wondering if im really the bad guy here and im ruining the holiday for everybody. sorry for such a long post i just needed to get this all out thank you",23Dec2019,1

I wish people would stop telling me that I need to get better already, and that I should just do yoga to make it go away basically. Like I just feel like the mental health system (in the US atleast) is super capitalist driven and is just trying to force people to feel nothing but good numb so they work and dont complain.

 Even with people who mean well just keep sending me messages that I should force all of my feelings down so I turn out like the people in the junji ito story about the people in the mountain holes and just ""be happy"" . Seriously everyone needs to stop feeling like anger, sadness, and anxiety are some how ""wrong"" emotions.

69,"[m21] I’m in a really dark place right now and I need help.  Just need someone to vent to.

Just this weekend was the first time I hung out with friends in like a year and it was my cousins.  I don’t have any “friend groups” because I always feel like I don’t belong in them.  But even with my cousins I feel like just empty space while everyone else is socializing and having fun.  And it seems like all my “popular” cousins who are around my age are doing really well in life, as if they just float through brick walls like nothing.  Then I’m down here trying to hold on for dear life, struggling to find my path.  It’s like I did shit in school thanks to my learning disabilities and I was never popular, and my cousins were popular AND got straight A’s while everyone else is basically kissing their ass’s.  

But it definitely doesn’t end there...

So I basically applied and got accepted to a really good tech school for welding but that’s because I just want to get away from my parents and get the hell out of this dying small town.  To be honest with you, I don’t even like welding.  It’s also worth noting that I want to become a writer and I need something to fall back on.

It keeps going... 

Another thing I wanted to point out is that I’ve tried to get my mom to bring me to a therapist because I literally cannot control my mood swings and I feel like I can get violent, almost to the point of hurting my mother or someone else.
Another thing I wanted to say was that I honestly don’t even know if I love my parents.  I cry all the time because I don’t understand why I have those dark feelings.  It seems like I care more about helping strangers than I do my own family.  WHY THE FUCK AM I LIKE THIS.  

And going...

Let me also say that my dad was verbally abusive to me as a kid, mainly because he denied that I had ADHD/dyslexia and just thought I was stupid to not know basic math problems.  He also cheated on my mom like 4 different times and is extremely hypersensitive about stuff.  He also calls himself a “Christian” even though he berates immigrants and refugees coming to our country, who just want a normal life outside of warfare.  So actually, to go back to my previous statement, no I don’t love him and I don’t give a fuck anymore.

I can keep going but I’m gonna end on this:

My life is even more complicated than what you just read.  From losing all my friends because of “not fitting in” or just embarrassing myself or pathologically lying to my parents all the fucking time.  I feel like a mess but I do want a wife someday because I just want somebody that will comfort me when I’m feeling down.  I’m at a point where I get a euphoric feeling about just ending it all.

I know it all sounds complicated and it’s fine if you don’t understand, but I just wanted to vent.  It’s not framed very well but whatever.  

All I can say is that I just want help or else I might just kill myself because I feel like an absolute failure.",23Dec2019,1
70,"Today my boyfriend checked himself into the hospital for mental health analysis, as he was at risk of committing suicide. This has been extremely hard for me.

The visitation hours are so strict and I'm so worried that I'll never get to see him. Although I plan to support the plan his mental health team makes about his discharge...how long do people usually stay in a unit like this? He is not aggressive or uncontrollable. In fact he is very calm and more of a self harm risk than a suicide risk, 99% of the time. Additionally, since he went in voluntarily, would he be able to leave whenever he wanted? Someone told me he would be in for over a month and unable to leave, even if he wanted and the thought of this scares me. Like I said, I plan to follow along with whatever doctors say, as long as he continues to want to be there and is doing better. I'm just hoping someone can clear my mind about this worrisome situation. Any love and encouragement is welcome, also.",23Dec2019,1

I thought being sober would help but it doesn’t. I just found myself having to do something else in order to keep my mind busy but that feeling of emptiness is still there. I feel like my mind goes blank sometimes. I can’t even feel sex. My chest and heart feel heavy. Everything is just meh. Everything. 

Worst part is I don’t seem to care either. I feel like I just spend time watching people be people. I watch them develop relationships and I think it’s interesting but I don’t have the need to have that.  Everything just might as well be in black and white and silent.

74,"I have a friend (will refer to as Bill, not his real name) on a DND discord server who is really into the game. He loves it and is on the server basically when hes not sleeping. At school or at home, Bill always comes if you ping him on the server. That might just sound like passion or obsession, but the problem starts when something happens to his character that he doesnt like. 

Of course some players get attached to characters and want to see them do well. There are people who bend rules, lie or even cheat to get what they want. But if something happens to one of his characters, he doesnt just get angry, Bill takes it personally. He seemingly literally FEELS what his character feels; loss anger joy, whatever his characters mood. It will even reflect in the way he speaks after the fact, sullen or cheery in exact ways his character feels.

Now all this might not sound so horrible. ""Fine, hes just really into dnd, its his life, it effects his mood severely but hes alright in the end"" but the problem came when a girl got invited to the server. He was actually the one to invite her (gonna call her Jill). She claimed they were ""friends on another server"" and that he ""wanted to teach her how to play dnd"". Thats all well and good. Another member that isnt the guy im talking about now starts (Code name Jack) chatting with her, they take it to dms and hit it off really well. He makes a flirtatious comment to her in the actual server, and the guy goes ""tell him ****! Ruin him so he'll shut up."" Come to find out later that the 2 (Jack and Jill) had hit it off REALLY well. Which didnt sit well with Bill at all. He did various things to upset Jill, but the main thing he did was threaten to kill himself the go offline for hours at a time. He literally has been completely different since what he calls a break up happened.

I'm so scared and confused personally on what to do. I tell him to go to therapy and get help but he says he doesnt need it. Is there a name for this? Any tips at all how I can get him to go get help? And if I cant, can I do anything to help him? I had the idea of roleplaying a therapy session where we slowly try to seperate Bill from his character, but I have no idea what im doing... Can anyone help?",23Dec2019,1

Where do i start with this...

First of all please dont mind my writing skills, its not the best i know \^\^.

So i first met Manuel when i was 8 years old. Back then he was a normal kid on the first look. But one day we were doing homework at my place and we started to annoy each other like many kids do. It got wilder and wilder like we hit each other for at least one minute. Then Manuel snapped and took an pencil and it landed in my shoulder (there is still a grey spot in my shoulder). That was the first time i felt that something is wrong with him. A long time he was pretty normal you didnt hear any weird stuff anymore. Then when we was 18 it started again and it was worse then ever. We started smoking weed and he got really paranoid and schizophrenic. I always told him not to smoke but he continues. He was then in a relationship for one year with a beautiful and smart girl. He started to flex with nudes from here  and showed them us in proud. He took these pictures without her knowing. She broke up with him because he tried to force her to smoke weed. From there on it goes down the hill, he starts to stalk her for some weeks and even knocked on the grandmas house of his ex gf. He went to the  psychiatry, me and the other few friends though it was a good thing he went there. Three days later he came out but his mental health was even worse. He started to talk more useless things then normal. It seems like he doesnt even know what he is talking. His whole persona got random, for example he started to talk to random girls about his private life and it was very cringy. He once thought his parents are CIA Agents and he was their ""cover"". There are many many other stories.

I really want him to get a diagnosis so he can be treated and improve. Even just a random though about what he may have would be unbelievably helpful. Thanks in advance!

So this has been going on pretty much for his whole life. And I am getting sick of it. My whole family sort of 'behind his back' all know that there is something wrong but nobody does anything. He is the type of guy who is extremely charismatic until he feels like you wronged him. And then it's like you flipped a switch and he goes into this weird state where he just HATES you. He'll scream that he hopes our parents die and wants them to rot in hell and runs up to them and me and mock punches us and pulls away at the last second. He just screams we dont love him and are wrong etc. These freakouts are triggered by little things. An example is (me and him alternate doing the weekend chores) when the weekend comes and it's his turn to do the chores he'll say ""no"" - ""you didnt do them 4.56 years ago, therefore I wont either"". Then when I tell him he has to he freaks. Or even when he got a ""B"" on a report card where he thought he got an ""A"" he flipped on his teacher basically exclaiming she was the devil incarnate. He also never seems to care at all about anything if he can get away with it. For example I am quite a clean person and like (we share a bathroom) to have my own towel and toothpaste and soap. He has no regard for this at all. He'll use my toothpaste and leave it cap off on the counter and then when confronted deny it vigorously. Or he'll when confronted about something storm up to our bathroom and spit on my toothbrush. I am just so stressed always now dealing with him. I dont know what to do. Also another example is he doesnt keep his promises. Ever.

So here's the problem: way too often I get a wave of revulsion just because someone said or did something I don't entirely approve or I find disturbing. A lot of this has to do with the way people live these days, and the fact that I simply feel like I don't fit in the modern society. 

I grew up in a religious home, so it's safe to assume a lot of my moral and values come from my upbringing, but I find it hard to believe that's all that there is. I'm not religious, and quite frankly I don't know if I have ever been. 

Recently a friend of mine met a guy, and after seeing him for the second time, she ended up hooking up with him. (Prior to this, she had never had sex)When she casually mentioned this to me, my body responded by wanting to vomit on the floor. I don't think it's my place to judge. I think everyone has the right to do whatever they wish with their body. I don't even think there is anything wrong with this, but yet - the disgust is there. It's there and it makes me lose my ability to sleep, eat or enjoy anything until I somehow manage to overcome this feeling for the timebeing. Where is this coming from? Sex was never a tabu in my family, and it's always been spoken of as a good and pleasant thing, though my family's religion prohibits premarital sex. It's not like I find sex disgusting. I've never had sex, but I fully aknowledge the fact that it's something I desire myself, and considering the amount of steamy romance books I've read and movies with sex scenes I've seen - it's not sex I find disgusting. But clearly I do have a problem with CASUAL sex. Sex without commitments. 

I can't see myself having sex unless it's in a stable relationship. Prefrably one that leads to marriage. And that's precisely while I'm still virgin at the age of 22 - I've not yet landend myself in a relationship. 

It's not just sex though. I have the same problem with alcohol. I don't drink, and I have absolutely zero desire to do so, and as long as it's strangers I don't care that other people do. But when I find people close to me do it -  the disgust, the wave of revulsion and discomfort - it's there again. I try my best to accept the ways of other people, but I can't help the physical reaction of discomfort every time a friend of mine mentions they got drunk or did something I would never do myself. 

There's a lot of other things I wish weren't making me feel so disgusted; men dressing like women or women dressing like men, the fact that 15 years olds are having sex, people acting like women and men are all the same, while they most certainly aren't. Many, many things that are constantly increasing in today's society. 

I obviously have somewhat conservative values and so on, but I also consider myself somewhat open-minded and I try to accept people and things as they are. In theory, I believe it shouldn't matter to me how other people live their lives, but why does it still cause me so much discomfort, and how could I possibly overcome this? 

I find, maybe in a way I hate to see people doing these things, because that makes them different from me, and therefore harderd to connect with. I have enough of trouble finding like-minded people as it is. But I wish I could somehow overcome this, as it really does cause me a lot of discomfort.",23Dec2019,1

I am 13 years old, no this is not me trying to be edgy, I have serious mental issues. It all started a year ago. Something started to change. I would be seriously distressed by seemingly banal and unimportant things.

But the thing that puzzled me the most is that it would be very specific things that would trigger that horrible reaction. Just seeing a picture of the Russian sleep experiment? Can't sleep for a whole month, started having delusions that I may be unable to sleep forever. There are many more but alas. I'm too panicked for that right now.

I have always tried to do good, always resisted bad thoughts, always helped people, told them
they are worth, and yet I cannot save myself?

This is my breaking point, the thoughts and pictures which challenge my core values, it's horrific, why can't I think good? From one thing to another, first it was the sleepless nights, and now.. I have perverted thoughts about animals?
Do you realise how painful it is? To even write this?
Do you know how hard it is fighting an internal battle every moment? I feel like I'm dying, my heartbeat increases, my mind turning into a haze.

I have prayed so many times, why can't you save me from myself, God? I have always done good and yet, I am forced to suffer endlessly, why can't I be a normal child? Why can't you take me back a few years ago when everything was ok?

I have never told anybody about the specific thoughts since they are so inhumane. I realise that this may be another reason why I am destroying myself, but I do not want to burden anybody, no never. I don't want to be a burden to this world, I don't want to become that which I have sworn to never be. And if I don't make it, grant me a peaceful death, for I cannot fight anymore.

I am stuck in this vicious cycle, the more I resist the stronger these thoughts get, and more inhumane feelings I'm not even supposed to feel come and darken my vision.

Let it be known that I have always at least tried to be a good person. If only I knew what my mind would become now..

But in the end, all I want is somebody to hug me and tell me its gonna be ok, but I don't have anybody..",23Dec2019,1
86,"Hello redditors.
I'm here because a friend I met online has been having issues and I want to help him.

The friend in question lives in the country of Georgia with a religious family that refuses to believe in mental health, in a problematic school that he says doesn't have a counselor or psychologist.

I'm very worried about him. When I met him he first tried to hide that he is trans (ftm) and his various issues.
Firstly, he has severe anxiety related to many things, to a crippling degree I'd say.
He gets bullied and abused both in school and at home.
He has had a long term problem sleeping, mainly because he ""can't relax/think of nothing/stand doing nothing"" and hears voices that are more prominent when he's not actively doing something.
He also has regular panic attacks, tries to change his appearance, feels his body isn't ""perfect enough"" to the point where he's regularly throwing up food he ate.

His family won't help him and his school can't be relied on, he says.

I'm very worried about him since he recently sent me a suicide note that I he luckily didn't act on in the end.

Is there anyone from the country of Georgia or knowledgeable in the countries mental health care to give me some pointers, some reading I can forward to him or anything like that?",23Dec2019,1

I have two contacts with psychologist at school and it was absolutely disgusting and unprofessional. He did not try to help me with my problem, he wanted to help school and I was a problem. Another specialist, which was invited by my granny said that I need just get up and live and help my granny and find the work and go to the college, other people have really big problems and I just sad and lazy. Despite the fact that I understand that they wasn't good psychologist and it was not normal, I'm still afraid of judgment from the new doctor.

90,"Hi friends!

I have been doing a lot of reparenting work and trying to heal some of my childhood wounds. Future self journalling has been really insightful and I’ve made a lot of progress. My focus at the moment is my anxiety around how people react to me eg. Obsessing over how mad my boss is gonna be if I call in sick, worrying about how my partner will take me bringing up this issue, etc. I want to work on accepting that I can not control other people’s emotional reactions and that how people react is often more about them than me. At the same time however I want to be a more considerate person which means taking into account how you affect other people. How do you mediate these two things? How can I not get so affected by other people’s feelings (which leads to anxiety, people pleasing and compulsive reassurance seeking) while still being mindful of my impact on others?",23Dec2019,1

We don’t have many friends but that’s okay when we are together because we keep each other occupied and can laugh and have endless fun together. When we have to be separated though (even for a short while, say a day, weekend, or week) I have this looming sadness over me. Not a disabling sadness but a present one definitely.  This is something that really only effects me. When we are apart, she is has a reasonable intensity of longing but nothing at the level I experience. This doesn’t bother me too much as I understand she can find happiness in other places, and I can too, it’s just that I have that looming sadness that I mentioned earlier cascading over my happiness.

So something amazing happened to me yesterday.

I suffer from Bipolar Disorder, BPD/PDNOS, ADHD, Anxiety, Depression, and so on, but my 17 year old sister doesn’t. She often used to judge me and think I was stupid for some of the decisions I made, which put a big rift between us.

Yesterday, she told me she had a psychology class describing BPD, and how its symptoms match my behavior and she cried.

She apologized to me for treating me so differently over the last few years and even offered to be my shoulder to cry on and to listen to me.

This was a HUGE step in her learning about psychology first hand as she wants to be a child psychologist. It really honestly made me cry.

97,"First off, I'm on my alt account that I mainly using for browsing the gaming side of reddit, I have some irl friends who know my main and I don't want them to find this shit. I'm not going to a mental hospital for this.

Second, I know that I'm not an incel, because it's nothing to do with women, it's me.

Third, I do have really bad anxiety and depression so I could just be freaking out right now.

Fourth, this is more of a vent but I just don't know where to go. Mods, please don't delete this.

-------

Fuck, I don't know where to start, honestly. I'm 14, I have major anxiety and depression, and Asperger's Syndrome. I'm super smart and all that, but I can't socialise for shit. Everyone at school just doesn't like me. I even followed a girl on instagram and she told me to unfollow me right then and there, and then blocked me afterwards...

I know that I'm not an incel, but I just feel like no one likes me or wants to be friends with me. Everyone talks shit behind my back, and whenever I try to talk to someone, they always want to like, not talk.

I'm even talking to this girl that I kind of like, and we've become best friends in the week we've been talking. She's like the only person who will talk to me. Even though she doesn't feel the same towards me, she said that it'll probably change the more we start talking.

I always doubt my appearance, my personality, everything about me. I'm really overweight, but at the same time I'm really tall so it may just be that (I'm 225 pounds and 6' 2.75""). My only real friend is that girl I'm talking to, I talk to none of my other ""friends"" outside of school or xbox parties.

I've had a habit of cutting since 5th grade. I tried to kill myself with it in 6th, even though that was probably the happiest time of my life. I stopped cutting earlier this year (April, right after a messy breakup). I want to start cutting again and I don't know why, but if I tell anyone like a teacher, I'm getting put in a mental hospital and not the help I need. My ex went to one and has PTSD from it, a patient sang Ocean Eyes all the time and every time she hears the song she gets in a really bad episode.

The only people who knew that I cut were that ex--fuck I miss her really bad but we broke up 3 times already and I think she hates me. All 3 times were from this other girl who played with her feelings and I'm pretty sure blackmailed her, btw my ex is bi. And also the girl I'm talking to now knows.

Speaking of talking to her, I just have a flirty personality in general whether it comes to girls or guys, even people I don't even like. Most of it's sarcastic. Anyway, I stopped being flirty with her recently because we're probably never going to date.

Just, all of this combined makes me feel like an incel. I know that I'm not, because I don't blame girls for myself, but I just feel like no one wants to date me or talk to me.

Someone please help me, I want to take my own life right now.",23Dec2019,1

But in the past couple of days i have also been feeling some pretty shitty feelings as well. Same with the good ones, these come up and disappear as well.

I can't just fucking stop hating myself. It gets even worse every time I eat. I posted on r/advice asking how to stop and all they had was weight loss advice. I know how to lose weight. I don't know how to not have crushing guilt and self-loathing every time I shovel more food into my disgusting maw. Every time I stop eating I tell myself never again and then, an hour later, all I can think about is the taste and textures. 

I have no self control. 

I try fasting but all it does is make me count down to when I am allowed to eat again and then feel like a giant dumpster fire when I do eat or fail a fast. I tried purging but I don't even have the wherewithal to keep up with that. 

It's not just eating. I'm good at finding proof of how amazingly vile and repulsive I am, the eating is just the most ready reason most of the time. 

I'm so sorry for spewing my needy garbage but I needed to do something or else rip my fucking hair out.

104,"Just from my experience in Mental Health, having suicidal thoughts, and actively self-harming or trying to commit suicide are two different things. 

It appears that the term ""suicide"" is used as a term to garner attention to get immediate action or attention from others to deal with ones issue. However, using this term for this purpose undermines it and creates a stigma that people are just saying it. I feel that if you have a situation and need support, there are ways of getting that support without having to resort to saying you are suicidal. 

For example, I've dealt with many individuals that use the term ""suicide"" to prolong their appointments, even though what they want to discuss has nothing to do with suicide. It's moreso that they want the attention and listening ear of someone to vent to. This is okay, and wanting support is a valid thing.

I’ve brushed it off times that I’m probably just lazy or being absolutely negative. I was afraid to go to the doctors and only to find out I’m making it up or that it’s just the way I am.

It was a relief today, for me to realised, whatever is happening to me for the past few years, is not normal and that I can do better.

I’ll probably go get a mental health check in my local youth community over the new few days. I’m still scared. But now that I kinda know what it is and how it has been affecting my life, I want to get better.

To whoever is reading this, I hope that things will get better for you too.",23Dec2019,1

116,"My personality is extremely competitive, and I kill myself to be the best at every single little thing. Even in volunteer organizations I get angry when I am not the best at a task or if there's someone else other than me doing it. On top of that I am extremely guarded/reserved. I hate most fun/social activities and can only talk if I consider it to be a talk about productivity- not small talk. People think I am arrogant due to this, and I am struggling to make any solid friendships. I am going on sudden mood swings lately when I feel I am not in charge of a situation/task and feel ostracized. These mood swings are becoming depressive now, and I really can't figure out the source of this.

Here's some introspect as it has recently turned into depression.

* When I feel I am not in charge of a situation or someone is telling me what to do, I feel ostracized.
* I get triggered when I am not the best a task or someone else is doing it other than me. On top of that I am extremely guarded/reserved. I am obsessed with productivity. I can't do small talks or fun/social activities- only productive talks. This leads people to think I am arrogant. I am struggling to make solid friendships now.
* I am worried that I'll start losing friends or maybe my personality has already changed due to these depressive mood swings and I can't notice it
* I hate to admit it and I try to bury it, but I may have some sort of jealously as well because one of my triggers is seeing my friends/family hanging out with people laughing and doing goofy things. I'll think/fear they like them more than me because I'll never have that personality
* Ex. There's a family member that's coming to visit for the first time in a while and that's already irritating me somehow. That he is going to get more attention/interactions than me; and I know it's completely wrong to feel that, but I can't help it
* And now even if I succeed in every single thing on my to-do list and excel in everything and accomplish my goals of being the best, I still feel completely empty

 I think my issue might be that I've always been just me against the world and braved through any hardships with just my high drive for success alone; But, I've never actually had a sense of family apart from just my parents. I think that now for once I actually feel as if I am close to some people and there's actually something more important than my drive and I fear losing that. I don't know if that is it. I already feel further apart due to depression from the only people I did have in my life for a bit.",23Dec2019,1
117,"i don’t know how to say this because i’m not usually one to do such a thing, i don’t reach out, i don’t speak. i ignore it because it just feels normal now, i’m used to this. i feel so alone and so damn cold all the time. i’ve been through a lot of change, both forced and unplanned. but regardless of what happens, nothing gets better. i’ve found myself out the edge of motivation and i think i’m just about to run out. i don’t know what to do or how to fix this, but i’m tired now. i’m so so tired. i’ve moved house, states, schools, countries, made new friends, tried new things, sought help from counselling and nothing has worked. i’m still sad. what i feel is as simple as that. i’m sad. i’m cold and i’m empty. i’ve been broken and pack together numerous time. the only difference between now and times prior is that i’ve gotten better at concealing my true colours when i shatter again. i’m tired of being apart, i’m exhausted. i feel like a failure, i have friends, but i don’t feel their love, i know it’s there but something about me won’t grasp it. i’ve tried convincing myself that i am loved but as much as i try, i don’t believe it. i don’t have any day ones, and everyone who i love, loves somebody else more. it feels like i’m the second priority to everybody and everything, regardless of whether i make them my first. i feel trapped within this life because waking up everyday grows to be more and more agonising. i go out, i see people, but once i’m home, i sit and think and believe the emotion i feel when i’m with others is merely a disguise because i don’t want to be vulnerable, i’ve spent too much time doing that. people have always just picked at me for it. in the worst way possible too. they attack my insecurities, my voice, my body, my colour, my differences, the things i try to love about myself are becoming the things i hate most because i’ve been made to feel so oppositions to the norm. i want to make everybody happy, i try to put myself before everybody, i don’t know how to be selfish. it seems everyone i know only know how to do this, and i get left behind. i’m the first to have my opinion oppressed and overlooked. i’m the first to have my desires out the window, yet i’m the first to put mine last in order for everybody else to be happy and even then, no gratitude is shown. i feel looked down upon, unloved, unwanted, like i don’t belong. i used to be scared but now it’s like i don’t care. i’m writing this because i’m stuck and unsure of what to do. i have no one to turn to.  i have no one at all.",23Dec2019,1
119,"Ever since a couple years ago eating some mushrooms and after doing a lot of drugs in high school my mindset has been off. I have a hard time sticking to anything, am very slow sluggish and awkward, and have really no emotional remorse or feeling for a lot of things mentally like I just don’t really feel much and am not aware of things a lot of times. I’m still half functional. I eat good, go to the gym and that helps some but no matter what there still feels a part of me missing mentally that wasn’t like that before. I over think things and worry and kind of make hasty decisions. I’m so scared of going on medicine because I worry medicine won’t help me. I know I need to talk to a Professional but I don’t trust them and my insurance is sub par. Should I try to pay out of pocket? Does this sound like medicine might be something that can help me?",23Dec2019,1
120,"So I'm usually pretty down (out of respect for those who are actually diagnosed I avoid using the word depressed) but honestly not at the moment. It's not like I'm happy but I'm not particularly sad either. I could describe it as this feeling of melancholy. This feeling of loneliness or this feeling of being lost in the world.

Anyways I always have a knive besides my bed because I'm a very fearful human and I always want something to protect myself if something happens. I've jused that knive for cutting myself before but I've never felt like how I felt yesterday. I laid down and suddenly I got a really unnerving feeling. All I could think about is that I should cut myself. I saw it right before my imaginary eye how the blade enters my flesh and even how the blade cuts open my artery. But I knew I shouldn't do it and tried hard to resist it. I couldn't even lie still because I got this urge to hurt myself.

After a few minutes I couldn't resist any longer so I made a compromise with me. I thought about cutting myself not with my knive but with my fingernail because this would hopefully cure my urge of self harm and not fuck up my skin that bad. So I started doing the cutting motion on my wrist. But suddenly I got into a complete frenzy. I couldn't stop anymore. I scratchrd/cut my whole arm up and down. I completely lost control and just scratched. After a while I could stop and think for a moment

I was surprised. I didn't know where that loss of control came from. When I turned on the light I was even seriously shocked l. My arm wasn't bleeding but obviously the parts I scratched turned red. I looked at it and was seriously shocked and ashamed of my self. I can't explain how I lost my control. I cut myself previously but as I like to say it, I did it controlled. I thought about where to cut so no one can see it and when to stop.

After that event the urge to self harm vanished. All was fine again. Its like all of this pressure was suddenly gone. I don't even know what that was. Anyways Thanks for reading my vent :)",23Dec2019,1
121,"I always had a good relationship with my fiancé’s family. (His mom and most of his siblings.) This has been especially important to me because I do not have a good relationship with my family. My dad is a massive narcissist and the rest of my family enables him. Over the summer a huge blowup happened and my fiancé’s family had to call the police on my dad. This all happened right after I’d come out from under anesthesia after surgery so I didn’t see what happened. All I knew was that cops were being called and legal action was being taken and I was begging my fiancé not to. I had no clue what happened I wanted him to talk to me first but he didn’t. Now I understand why, but I didn’t at the time. 

My fiancé’s sister told him I’m extremely manipulative and selfish because I begged him not to call the police. If I wasn’t high on anesthesia and having an extreme situation sprung on me I wouldn’t have done that . She offered me and him to come live with her but I said no, because I was under threat by my family . They financially forced me to move back with them. It’s been a living hell of a year. I’m officially moving back out from under my family’s roof in a few weeks but I’ve had to keep my relationship with my fiancé secret because they’ve threatened both of us. 

Well I went to my fiancé’s house yesterday , as his family is here for Christmas. All of them except his mom ignored me , treated me as if I don’t exist (minus a few glares) and invited him , just him, to family Christmas. I’ve never not been invited and I am not just his girlfriend anymore, I am his fiancé. I’ve been crying for 2 days because I thought they’d be my family at least because I’m going to have to cut my entire family off soon for my own safety and the safety of my fiancé. But now they all hate me. They’re treating me the way my friends did when one of my friends killed her self and I was blamed. They’re not even looking at me and if they do they glare. Pretending I don’t exist. That was the first time I’ve felt unwelcome in his house. I felt so small .

126,"Hi,

I know this place is not for diagnosis, I’m just here for some suggestions. I suffered an episode of psychosis in December 2015. Another one in September 2017. In my first episode i was diagnosed ( by my first psychiatrist) with “first episode of psychosis”. In the second one my second psychiatrist said it was “simple bipolar” (whatever that is). I have been very stable for a long time now and have been doing quite well recently (academically) Despite all this i believe there is more to my condition than just that. Both of my psychotic episodes involved obsessions with female friends. Wanting desperately to get their attention, sending them messages and trying to convince them of “My love” for them. Even now a decent conversation with a girl would make me obsessed with her and i would write about her for about two hours intermittently until i can get her out of my system. The people around me also get a bit confused with me. Some claiming i have some sort of “personality disorder” ,  I’m guessing because they see different sides of me and are unable to reconcile them. I am not known to be violent or anything of that sort. I used to be the “good child” of the family and friends, and perhaps still am but i was known to be highly sensitive. I have discovered in the past year that i feel extremely at peace when i write and perhaps this has brought more stability than i could ever ask for.  I have added something i wrote today about one of “my obsessions “.  I hope this may help. (Pardon my weak English)

“The stunning beauty standing somewhere near me. She’s looking at me with bewilderment. She had seen me before. Met me but had not found me. Where ever she put her hand and wherever she looked she saw nothing of me. I could not be found but she kept looking. Confused as she was, she had seen nothing like this before. Perhaps it was this that drew her near me. But then she saw a glimpse of something. What is that she said. There was no one to respond. But something inside her told her, no, stay away from me she said. I have seen a part of you that i have seen in no one else. It was ugly and she could see it. Distorted. It smelled bad. She had known what she needed to know. But there was still something that kept her thinking. I want to see more she said. But without letting him know. And so she did. She did everything she could. Until she saw just what she needed. A place where he had everything of himself. And she saw all of it, touched one by one, smelled every single bit of it, and tasted each part. Profound she said. Profound. There is so much more of him that she will never know. But she wanted to go to the source of what she had seen. But not now. Perhaps some time in the future. Till then she will taste everything that comes out of the source. Like breadcrumbs. And she will find in it all that she needed. In each part, she found something new. Something she had never tasted before. And as she was feeding on some of what he had left, she looked up, and there it was the source. But she could see nothing but the ugly distorted part. But she knew there was something behind all of that that she needed to see. So she went to him. Fought with him. She screamed. Show me what you have. What is there to hide. Tears came out of her eyes and she fell down on her knees. Show me she said. Crying with tears and with a quivering voice she said one last time. Show me. A touch of his hand on her chin. She looks up. And he brushes her hair and her head with his hand. There is nothing to show he says. The ugly part you saw. The rest is uglier. And he took out everything of him out in his hand. In his palm there lay all his essence. What he had despised all his life. He looked away. Silence and more silence. And then something touched his palm. A soft touch and nothing more. And he looked in front of him. Her her hand on his. And as he looked up, a smile that was on her face. All that he had craved and all that he had ever wanted, he had it. And as she looked through him she found something else, something that was hidden, too far down to have been touched by any form of existence. Far away from what he thought he was, and away from all that existed. And she went to it and touched it. And took it out from him and placed it on her palm. It shined. Not bright, but a glow. A glow never seen before. And the world saw something it had never seen before. And they both looked around them and the world had never been like that before. It was a a new beginning for everything that was. Time stopped until it broke and what followed had no past. What followed was all that had been and all that was going to be. All that ever was, all that was ever going to be. “",23Dec2019,1

129,"This is my first post here. I’m also on mobile, so please forgive any formatting errors.

I recently started seeing a therapist at the recommendation of my primary care doctor. I have problems and I know that, but I never thought I had problematic problems, If that makes sense.

Well my therapist is extremely insightful and wise. Over the course of seven or eight sessions I’ve learned that not only do I have so called “problematic problems” but I have trauma that I haven’t dealt with. Trauma is a super scary concept, right? When I think trauma, I think dark. The darkest of the dark. The worst of the worst possible things that could happen to an individual.

Turns out, I was comparing my trauma to others’ trauma, looking at it side by side to those who have suffered the unimaginable. Through doing this I was subconsciously minimizing my trauma. I was repressing it. Ignoring it.
Get this: trauma isn’t one-dimensional. It is deep-seated far beneath your skin and into every atom of your being. It is profound. Complex. Everyone’s is different and unique.

My trauma being brought to light changed everything. I have the chance now to walk step by step through my past at my own pace and comprehend my feelings on my own terms. How amazing is it that the very same brain that processes our trauma and stores it away to the deepest parts of itself, can then bring it forward again and reprocess it in a healthy way?",23Dec2019,1
130,"I’m so overwhelmed, yet so drained and exhausted. This has been a really, really tough year. I hate my job. Mentally I’m unwell, but can’t afford to see anybody even with my insurance because I have to meet the deductible before I get any coverage and I can’t afford even a $150 consultation. I have interviews for new jobs that would be good opportunities financially and help me/us out, but I’m near crippled with anxiety by the thought of change, going into something new, unsure if I’ll even like it, or if I’ll do well. This job even offers a $5000 sign on bonus, which is what intrigued me because that is damn near life changing money to me, but I’m sat here wondering what kind of stressful job this must be if they offer a sign on bonus, which I’ve never had in my life. 

Honestly, I just want more than anything to be able to take a sabbatical from working and just...I don’t know. Have a minute to fucking breathe? Be able to work on my mental health? But I can’t. I’m supporting myself and my SO right now, we’re barely getting by. So I’m pressuring myself to find a new job just for the money. At first when I started looking it was to find a job I’d be happy at, but right now I can’t focus on my happiness. My main focus is surviving, and getting the bills paid until my SO can find work again and I can finally nurture myself more (we got his debts paid but still have mine left) and I want to go back to school to pursue a career I’ve chosen, but with living off of my sole income, that’s impossible. I applied for financial aid, and despite not even making enough to support myself alone, I apparently make too much for any monetary help that isn’t a loan. And fuck loans. Debt has exhausted and almost debilitated me and after spending the last year and a half trying to dig myself and SO out, I refuse to take on anymore debts.

I’m not sure if it’s just the bad day I’m having, how I woke up sick and in pain, my anxiety, or what, but I just want to curl up in a ball and not have to worry about work, bills, money, life, everything for a few weeks. I want to hibernate, and just get my head on straight.

This year has been absolutely draining, and I’m barely clinging onto the hope that the new year will be different, be better. 

I’m spiraling and I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to bother my friends, they have their own things going on, busy lives, careers, and they’ve never had to go through the struggles and hardships that come with growing up broke and still being broke as an adult. I don’t want to express this to my SO, as easy as it is to talk about these things, because he’s already down and having a hard time with not having a stable job by now, since quitting his old one in the summer (albeit unexpectedly, which is sort of why we’re in this position now..). So I have to continue to stay strong for him, but I’m so tired of being strong all the time. I feel myself breaking but if I break then life will just become 10000x harder.

I just need relief. Mental and monetary relief. I can’t *afford* to have such anxiety, to be depressed, to hate my job. I can’t think about it for long or I get upset and then this happens. I don’t know what to do anymore.",23Dec2019,1
131,"Today, I was very alone. I sat in the kitchen wrapping gifts, and I was speaking to myself, as in I were somebody else. I speak to myself often, but not in a me talking to me, type situation. Ever since I was a young boy, I would imagine those whom I had seen on TV or even somebody I would see at school who treated me with a morsel of respect, even if it was a small chat, at home I would have full conversations with myself, in their metaphorical shoes.

Occasionally, when I was suspended, in between schools after expulsion, or on holidays, I would be left alone in the house all day since I was 7. I would often make coffees for myself and for whoever I was speaking to, I didn’t want to break my personal illusion, so I’d often drink two coffee’s at a time, since I was about 9. I’ve continued an addiction to coffee into my current teenager hood, often drinking 6 coffees per day, cutting down on my previous 7-9 although I’ve stopped making coffees for my “friends” .

I would often go into cycles of nocturnality, so I could speak in a decent volume without my mother hearing, in fact, she knows none of this. At night, I would watch tons and tons of pirated films and television shows, making me as much of the pop culture / film buff I am today, I would watch this movies and critique them to “myself”

132,"It seems most people around me get pets, and are too lazy to put in the effort of educating themselves of their pets needs, besides feeding them. I had a friend who had a 15 year old cat. It was looking skinnier than usual, and was losing fur on it's back. I suggested the cat might have hyperthyroidism. His response was ""hyperthyroidism? Never heard of it"" you've had a cat for 15 years, and have never heard of hyperthyroidism? Dumb mf...he took it to the vet, and I was right. If I weren't to bring that up, then the cat would probably still be suffering. Another time my mom said her dog had been pawing at its face for months, and causing scabs. I took a look. And one of his teeth were rotting out and his gums were dark red. Her response ""oh, I didnt know you were suppose to clean your dogs teeth"" now, most of these people dont take their pets for annual checkups, otherwise I'd just let the vets do their jobs, but if they dont take them to the vet, than how is that suppose to happen? I feel no one has an excuse of neglecting a pet these days. Everyone has smartphones, and all the information they need in the palm of their hand, but still, people seem to be ignorant, so I feel it's my job to educate them. I think I am morally obligated to do so, because if I didnt than the animal would continue to suffer. I know better, and they dont. I cant go on this way worrying about every animals I see for the rest of my life. I'd rather kill myself.

133,"So I'm familiar with the absence of joy or any positive feelings even though I'm supposed to be doing something that I enjoy. I had my ups and down and I thought I was making a recovery. But lately when I think about doing something that I enjoy ... it simply hurts. 

I guess it's better than being devoid of any feelings at all but the emotional pain is so bad that I can feel it in my body. I can physically feel my heart ache. I can't really describe the feeling it's like fear mixed with anger ... 

The best I came up with is shame. 

I feel intense shame for enjoying what I like ( art and storytelling ), I have no control over it and I'm scared to die full of regrets.

Have anyone experienced something similar ? Is it going to go away ? What can I do to feel better ?

134,"For most of my life on and off, I've been experiencing this weird thing that happens to me after waking up and I'm not sure why it is.  


What will usually happen is I will wake up after an hour or so after going to sleep, and then I will start to feel my mood fluctuate upon waking. This will go from feeling fairly normal, and 10 seconds later it will become uncomfortable anxiety, irritability, racing thoughts, breathlessness, sometimes heart palpitations and nausea (the usual symptoms of panic attacks or anxiety attacks I think.)  


Writing it out, all it sounds like is just someone having a panic attack after waking up, which seems like is not uncommon, though it still is confusing to me. I've been trying to figure out for years why this happens, and it seems to happen after being woken up by it. It makes it very difficult to go back to sleep because of how strong it can be. This doesn't happen very often though, I would say about twice a month, but it still makes it very difficult to enjoy sleeping etc.  


In the new year I'm planning to take antidepressants to try and help with my initial anxiety &amp; depression I experience on a daily anyway, but last time I used SSRI's I did experience the post-nap panic attack feelings, but this time I felt a ice cold sensation spread through my head until the blood in my ears sounded quite loud and I was seeing stars, like when you get really dizzy. I'm a little bit nervous about trying it.

To be honest, I'm not sure what I was looking for writing all this out, I just needed to write it down so that someone may read it and relate, or be able to help me, as I just can't seem to find anything for this anywhere on the internet. It always seems to be talking about anxiety before sleeping and not quite the right symptoms similar to what I am experiencing, but I don't know really.

137,"So I'm visiting my mom over the holidays, she lives in a single family home with her partner. And there is another guy (around 40) who is renting the basement at the moment. He does not work or ever leave the house because he has an disability and gets money every month from the government, which at the time I thought it was just physical disability. The renter's mother never disclosed what kind of disability he has, so my mom and her partner just brushed it off. The house doesn't have great sound proof so any loud noise can be easily heard.

Things were going great the first couple of months, the guy was so quiet it's like he's not even there. Then it would get worse and much worse over the months. He started to spout random foul words by himself at night, and then go on a sudden burst of rage, smashing things, followed by a loud disturbing shriek the neighbors could even hear. He then would go completely quiet like nothing has happened.

My mom's partner had talked to the guy before renting, but he seemed complete normal and nice as her partner would describe it.

I've been through this many times before when I come visiting, but today is the worse one yet, the entire house was shaken and I almost had a literal heart attack. Now I'm starting to wonder if he does this every weekdays. Trust me, you do not ever want to be there when it happens. It's like real life horror, I don't think I have been through anything like this. And I'm pretty sure he broke things in the basement...

Also something to point out - it's not fear I feel when I feel as if I've committed a sinful act, its more just the feeling that I've done something wrong even though I actually haven't. 
How does one learn to overcome this feeling? It has begun to tamper with my relationships with people and I want to be able to do normal things without feeling guilty all the time. I know I am a (relatively) good person, but have this constant need to abstain from everything.

I am an alcoholic and I know this. I have been sober for 3 years and had 1 drink at my company's Christmas party. I would have drank more, but I know now I was sick and that is what made me nauseous. I thought it was because I haven't had a drink in 3 years.

151,"Hello, 17yo Female here. I'm from Michigan and for most of my life I've been homeless. I am not in poverty, I just have irresponsible parents. We've been homeless on several accounts of my mom not having enough common sense to pay her bills before buying cigarettes and weed. Those things has always been her main priority. I struggle with PTSD,anxiety and depression. I'm filled with trauma and have a history of suicidal tendencies. I gave up on killing myself only because I am too coward to do so. I have social issues but other than that I am intelligent, but because of my isolation towards the world I throw myself at anyone who gives me their time, that landed me in a relationship with a manipulator and narcissistic guy who's super into himself. He doesn't even care about my situation and on many different occasion he have told me I am useless and in his way. The only time he accepts or is nice to me is if I am willing to have sex, otherwise he'll pretend I don't exist. Anyways, my mom also has a history of abusing me, emotionally/verbally and when I was younger ,physically. My main goal is to graduate but because I am currently homeless that is a struggle. I feel that college is my only way out of this hell hole really. I honestly hate myself, because I am useless even to myself. I wish things were so different and I was happy.

152,"As far as I can remember (except my childhood) I've always been an introverted person and I also had social anxiety so I had a closed group of friends but outside of that I always had anxiety when meeting new people. After being around a lot of people in school or university I always had to go home and stay by myself to recharge. I've always enjoyed staying alone and watching tv shows and movies or just watching random videos on youtube. 

Now I'm almost 23(male). I'm still not the most sociable person (at least my social anxiety is not that bad anymore) but i really enjoy hanging out with my friends and talking to them.

But all this comes at a cost. Now, if I'm at home and I have no one to talk to I get a rush of lonelynes and maybe depression. Even if there is a movie I'm enjoying, as soon as the movie is over it's like i suddenly realise that I'm alone at home and that rush of lonelynes and depression hits me from nowhere. 

I don't really understand where all of this came from. It's nice to be more sociable than I was but these side affects really drain me.",23Dec2019,1
153,"So as context I'm currently 21 at the moment, living with my parents, and socially incapable. I've wasted the last 3 years of my life, 2 studying a course I ended up hating and another cause the course that I'll be studying next year was full this year. My family is not well off at all and will probably only be able to fund my first year of study after which I'll have to hope for a bursary or scholarship or something. This is relevant because my mom is looking to leave my dad, and she wants to bring me, my sister and my gran with her.

 Issue here is that she doesn't make enough money to support us at all. And so wants me to find a part time job to help out with the money. This whole endeavor of hers has been going on for a long time and I once asked the family of a very close friend (like a brother type of friend) of mine when her wanting to leave him first came about if I'd be able to crash with them, since it would make it easier on her, since she doesn't even have the budget to afford a place big enough to find us all and is too proud to accept my offer to sleep on a couch so that she could get a smaller place (which would naturally be cheaper).

I've found myself reluctant to get a job because I don't have a means of travel, I can't afford a car, petrol(gas) or insurance, and our public transport is terrible here but also because I'm extremely shy, I struggle to act and articulate properly when talking to new people. Plus I feel like I'm just going to wear myself dry if I had to try and uphold a part time job. And yes this whole part makes me feel scummy, I just can't find any willingness within myself despite how much I'd need to take the responsibility.

So now the real reason for my post, for the past 8 days I stayed over at my friends place (same friend as mentioned above), his parents went on holiday for a week and he asked me over so the place isn't as lonely. And his parents came back and asked me to stay and extra night there, as a catch up and what not and last night I went just perchance to their laundry room to offer his mom help with the washing and she took the chance to let me know that if things get to heated next year with the family matters that I'd be welcome to move in by them for mental health sake so that I can minimise stress while studying, and... my first reaction was to internally joke to myself about getting my stuff from home and moving in, and it just ended up feeling like I wasn't joking to myself. The whole time I was there, I found myself willing to help out with chores, never in my life have I felt willing to do dishes of my own volition at my own home and yet there I'd happily sit and do them willingly without so much as a complaint on my part, that's just an example, it extends to anything that could've been a chore. But anyways I digress, I even asked her if I'd need to offer anything financially and hell at one stage I even offered as a joke to learn proper cooking and do their cooking for them, I wanted it to be known that I don't want to be a burden or a freeloader to them, should I ever take up her offer. And that offer has just been sitting in my mind relentlessly now.

I got home about 2 hours ago, and hell even waiting for my mom to pick me up I felt a deep sadness, I didn't want to go home, I feel more at home there than I do in my own household, hell I even cried a little bit earlier, I just felt this overwhelming sense of sadness and longing. I know I could never be a part of their family and yet I wish I was, I got a stronger familial feeling there than I do with my actual family, I'd never call them mom or dad, bro, sis anything like that, but it just felt more, complete, happier. And I think this is the key right now, it's that everything just felt happier there, this house is so fucking depressing.

I want to take up her offer and move there, I know that there's money that I'd be able to compensate my stay with, and even if the money isn't enough then I'd find other ways to compensate my stay. It's just that my mom is far too proud to accept it, she wants to solve everything herself, and I've giving to solutions that would make things much much easier on her, but she refuses to accept it. and I know, I'm 21, I'm a grown ass man, I should make my own decisions. But men have a particularly bad reputation in my family, my dad has torn my family apart, we've all accepted him as absolute scum, and I swore to be different, but I know that if I left, despite how much easier it would make everything for everyone, I know that I'd hurt my mom and gran by leaving and it would tear another hole into the family, and that alone would make me no better, and I'm struggling to accept breaking some eggs to save the basket, cause she'll be free of my dad, but in turn I'd become a new wound emotionally. I mean, what mother wants to see her family ripped apart like this?

This post was mostly a vent, but any advice as to whether I should stay or consider going is very very very welcome. I'm honestly considering talking it over with her soon.

My mom has always been a weird cookie. People around me always say she's a bad person and that I shouldn't turn out like her. I always felt like there was something off, but I can't tell if any of the following things she does can be classified as emotional abuse. Here are the things she does:

-when she questions me on topics for an upcoming test, she starts with the things written first in my notebook, and if I don't know these things (even if I'm confident I know something written after it) she will hand me my notebook back and say ""you don't have a clue""

-she often gets upset for the smallest things. She has a temper that is always on fire and I constantly have to watch her mood

-whenever I make last minute plans with friends she says ""oh so you just ask this right now? What if I already made plans for us"" then another time she goes ""why don't you ever hang out with such and such? You should call them up""

-I have to do basically everything in the house. Sure she puts clothes In the washer and cooks sometimes, but it's mostly me that does everything else

-she complains about how much her back or feet hurt in order to get out of said tasks, then when I say I won't do a certain thing because I dont feel like it, she sobs and puts on a sad face (fake cry is also present sometimes) 

-she puts me in various programs (like art therapy and ""social exercise group"") but has stopped sending me to a psychologist when I obviously needed one

-questions herself why I am depressed

-acts like a totally different person in public as opposed to at home 

-constantly goes on TV shows that people and employees at my school watch and then acts butthurt when I tell her I am sometimes ashamed of her. I get that she's trying to make a name for yourself, but, when your daughter is in the last three years of primary school (6-15) I don't think its very inappropriate to go on a dating show acting like an idiot

157,"Recently I was at a party where I got drunk and started telling people I'd die for them because my life had no value. I supposedly emptied the contents of my heart to people and started going on about how I feel a lot of family members and relatives try to live their lives through me. I ended up crying and also stating that I always suppress my emotions as best as I can because I'm usually the person who's always hapy and ok and helping other people through their problems. Eventually I stopped crying, calmed down and was told ""It's ok to not be ok."", which was something that seemed to work at the time.

The truth is, I really don't see value to much life, I don't find enjoyment in a lot. I commonly fake being happy or caring about certain things. I don't want to die as such, but I feel life has nothing but short lived, false happiness to offer. I told someone I would speak to someone about it but I won't. I don't want therapy and also don't think it will work. My view of the world is philosophical; We are born, and we die. Eventually, no one will remember you and nothing you ever did will matter.

Sometimes though, I feel as though I don't deserve to have the issues that I have, or that I have not suffered enough to justify their existence. A lot of people's anxiety or depression comes from negative past experience, but compared to many others who suffer these kinds of problems, my past experiences are just fine. My parents never divorced, I was never abused, no notable deaths early-on in my life. The only difficulty I really had was growing up with an autistic sibling.

I was just wondering if anyone else here felt the same way. Ironically, this feeling of not deserving my anxiety only fuels the fire and causes me more anxiety as a result. Does anyone here happened to have some kind of solution to this problem, or at least some sort of remedy?",23Dec2019,1
166,"Well I'm not sure what the right word for it all is. I'm finding it increasingly harder to talk to my loved ones, friends, or counselors about my mental health. I used to be able to like nothing but now it's like I'm not really there and there's never a right time to. I feel out of it and constantly anxious or constantly unmotivated.
Its not as bad as it used to be which would be a visit to the hospital or just panic attacks after another. But instead it's just this feeling, you know? It's easy to hide and just hard to talk about. I can be happy in a moment but at the end of the night there's that feeling. I find myself crying by myself but still feeling like someone witnessed it and there's no point in telling someone else? If that makes sense at all. There's nothing holding me back from getting things done yet I can't seem to get myself to. I'm getting way more invested into my phone and mindlessly scrolling. My hope is that someone knows the perfect answer for it all but I know everyone's experience is different. I'm aware that I'm not alone but I guess that's what I'm feeling? I'm just clueless.",23Dec2019,1

DESCRIPTION AHEAD!:


Beatings with no end in sight, if I were to cry, I'd get beaten harder, and harder, and harder. Belts on my back, whipping the air out of my lungs.""You're ugly, a fat mutant "".""I don't want to be seen with you"".

Irony is, I grew up quite beautiful, or at least others say that I am. I hate it. I hate my eyes. I hate it all. 

And even uglier, now that I am what I am, I can't help but play games. I enjoy bending people to the point of breaking. I want to feel powerful. I'm never going back there. I refuse to. I have to strain myself A LOT not to hurt my loved ones even if I know that I could just as easily break them. I KNOW IT'S WRONG. Why am I so fucking broken? Why do I enjoy this? Can I ever change?

168,"# Losing A Loved One

It can be very difficult to navigate the holiday season in the wake of losing a loved one. The pressures of the season can feel overwhelming to someone still experiencing grief, causing some to simply choose not to participate in the usual traditions of decorating, parties, and gift giving. The holidays and traditional family gatherings can magnify the loss, exposing family members to deep emotional pain. The person who was always present at the family events is now notably absent, triggering grief and profound feelings of loss. Memories of holiday celebrations over the years can enhance the sense of loss.

# Family Estrangement

 Family estrangement is not a new phenomenon, although political tensions in recent years have increased estrangement between family members due to political disagreements. Reason family members might choose to end contact may include lifestyle choices, emotional, sexual, or physical abuse, differences in values, substance abuse, broken trust bonds, financial improprieties, and interpersonal relationship issues.  

Outside of the holiday season it is easier to compartmentalize the estranged family member. Daily life can obscure the emotional implications of estrangement, where the holidays bring family into sharp focus, making the loss feel intensified.

# How to Cope With Loss or Estrangement During The Holidays 

When the loss or estrangement is recent, it is sometimes wise to divert away from the traditional activities that only make the loss more painful. In the event of grief and loss, try changing it up this year by doing something completely different. As a family, consider going out to see a holiday production together or going out to dinner and a movie instead of the usual family meal. Or, maybe rent a cabin in the mountains and have the festivities there, or have a picnic at a scenic outdoor location.

When dealing with estrangement, knowing that the family member will be present can trigger anxiety, so practice deep breathing and mindfulness to help keep your cool while at the gathering. Make your mind up to shelve the bad feelings, such as residual anger or resentment, for the sake of the family on that one day, and to avoid any conflicts by keeping your distance as much as possible. Of course, there is always the option to simply not attend the family gathering.

# Importance of Self-Care During the Holidays

 Learn the importance of self-care during the holidays. Spend time doing the things that bring you pleasure, such as getting a nice massage, reading, seeing friends, or getting a pedicure. Focus on wellbeing by getting quality sleep, engaging in regular exercise, and avoiding sugar overload. Acknowledge that this year will be difficult, and realize that the holidays will soon pass.

169,"I'm becoming more and more despondent. It's been a long process of finding out this and then that and then something else isn't working in my body. To begin with, I went to a GP about depression. They then gave me a blood test and found out I was deficient in Vitamin B12, Vitamin D, and Folic Acid. Had a load of injections for that and still have to have them on a three-month basis for the rest of my life. Then when the symptoms of depression didn't let up they conceded there was something else going on but they weren't sure what.

They gave me anti-depressants and referred me to a hospital for further investigation into my digestive system. I was then referred to a counseller for treatment of the depression. Turns out I was suffering from something resembling trauma after the responsibility for a friend's self-harming and attempted suicide were unfairly passed onto me. I was with this counsellor for a year after which the depression became manageable. With the daily dose of anti-depressants, I was beginning to be able to feel things other than... well, nothing.

And yet what I've felt since then has been horrible. I've developed an acute awareness that my closest friendships and family relationships are incredibly unstable and I can flip out at the slightest sign of irritation. And it's pure rage. I've had to try so hard not to chuck something across the room upon hearing something condescending or... well, just annoyingly repetitive. I'm constantly irritable and on edge. I slam cupboard doors, throw things in the sink, type with an urgent frustration. 

And yet this isn't all. There's an unending emptiness. Perpetual boredom and loneliness. Even in the company of others. Even when distracted and busy. And any attempts to fill the space with something tend to be incredibly impulsive. I impulse bought a tarantula because I thought it would keep me busy. I impulse bought gerbils because I couldn't see a friend anymore. I impulse buy food, unhealthy crap like cheesecake and ice cream, and I impulse buy presents for my friends. Some of it has even become dangerous. I taught myself how to throw kitchen knives into a communal noticeboard out of boredom. 

I have intense mood swings, can suddenly fall into an episode of depression for hours on end over a stupid comment or one stray thought. I can't stand being away from my dearest friend. I constantly fear they'll leave me and find somebody else. I had to block them on snapchat because I practically stalked them on snapmaps whenever I felt insecure about whether or not they still had time for me. I buy them gifts and try to show them as much love as possible despite not being able to articulate myself properly. I went into my overdraft buying their Christmas gift this year. And yet... I have been viciously rude to them before for spending time with somebody else. For keeping secrets. For changing their mind on something that was none of my business.

I don't know who I am, what I like, what I want to do, where I want to go. And, despite not intending on killing myself anytime soon, suicide plays on my mind a lot. 

I don't know whether or not to go back to the GP and speak to them about this, or if I'm just fucked.",23Dec2019,1

172,"I don't know if this is a mental illness, or if this is even related to mental health, but I just decided to post here because I'm not sure where else this fits.

I've always been interested in outer space, not the science of it, just the place itself. I've felt homesick to pictures of space stations from games (specifically Space Station 13.) The idea of just living in outer space is somehow so freeing, peaceful.

I've never felt at home on Earth. It may be due to my lack of travel experience, but it seems that no matter where I look I feel like I'm in the deep past, like I'm meant to be living in the 'sci-fi' future or whatnot. I somehow seem to find futuristic sounds in old-school songs like Raver's Fantasy by Manian, and all the songs in the rave-techno genre.

It appears I remember seemingly fake memories, one example is where I'm in a, once again, futuristic indoor stadium, watching a performance. Don't remember what it was about, but it had people with cyberpunk clothes, and the whole outlook of the memory was really cyberpunk-like, and the more I try to remember those memories the more homesick I feel.

I might be delusional, but I really can't explain those feelings. It just seems I don't belong here on Earth. I've never found true emotional connections to humans either, despite how social I might be with friends, because I find a sense of humor to be a good thing, however, I have never considered myself 'attached' to my friends. I wouldn't care if I had to leave all of a sudden without the chance to say goodbye, and I probably won't even care if a family member died.

However, it seems I am somewhat curious about specific places - especially those snowy places with a lot of nature. I started getting attached to nature these days, I have even begun 'worshipping' nature, feeling one and connected with nature on an emotional level. I've never felt emotionally attached to anyone or anything, until I moved to a greener place and started seeing how beautiful nature can really be, especially in areas outside of Israel, where I'm currently living temporarily.

I'm not sure what this thread really is about, just another vent I guess. I can't write about my feelings all that properly because I have no idea how to explain them. Sorry for the confusion.",23Dec2019,1
173," 

I recently got into an argument with some people online about whether or not a person needs to meet the definition of a medical, neurological or mental condition in order to actually be such. Long story short - I ended up getting blocked by a lot of people, particularly young people (teenagers). Basically, these people I was arguing with, were promoting the idea that sometimes medical/neurological/mental conditions can be a choice for a 'fun' personal label, and because there are people who identify as having a neurological condition without any neurological symptoms as per the definition put out by doctors, it means not everyone with a condition has to have the symptoms associated with that condition to be valid, and they should be respected. Some of the justifications I have seen from these people, is that these identities are 'cool' or 'fun'.

I believe the term for this is appropriation and I am wondering how most people feel about it. For example, is an ''autistic identifying'' person with no neurological symptoms (by their own admission) just as valid as a person diagnosed with autism by a doctor, who shows profound neurological symptoms, even though a person with autism who has no neurological symptoms would not fit the vast majority of dictionary and scientific definitions of being autistic?

There are many other conditions, particularly mental and neurological ones, that are being appropriated on popular social media. Do you believe that appropriating medical conditions is necessarily a bad thing?",23Dec2019,1
174,"I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and have been since I was 12 or 13. However I'm pretty sure I also have ADHD. Since I was little, I've always had trouble with organization, procrastination, and daydreaming/inability to focus.

But she's only known me for a year and I'm 19. I had okay grades in high school but it came with tremendous difficulty.

The dog follows my mom around so i can’t even pet her that often. Therapy doesn’t help because i can’t open up to people.

Upon really realizing and accepting that depression is what I’ve been struggling with I’ve been seeking help from a psychologist since October of last year which has helped me out a lot. However, lately (I’d say with the last 3 months or so) things have been getting very difficult for me. Difficult to the point where my mind will stray into darker places and I start contemplating harming and even killing myself. I’ve experienced thoughts of suicide before but now it has come to the point where if the day ever came and I actually built the courage to do such a thing I know exactly how I would do it. I’ve spoken to my physician and my psychologist about medication before but I just can’t get past the idea of having to take a pill every day just to feel normal. I’m starting to feel like I don’t have a choice in this situation and a couple weeks I even started considering admitting myself into a psychiatric hospital. I recently brought it up with my therapist and he told me that if I ever started contemplating suicide that I should admit myself to a hospital. I’ve heard a few stories of people going to those places and I feel that every story I’ve heard was from a person in a way worse situation than I. As of right now I’ve never once attempted to harm or kill myself and I’m aware that those hospitals contain people who struggle with behavioral/mental illnesses far worse than what I’m going through.

This then made me feel if I am not going above for people then it is assumed I am automatically selfish. Which is something I have been fighting back and forth on for years. I assumed people were all good and I thought has good intentions like myself but I would choose the wong people to rely on because of my low self-esteem. I would hold onto friendships that were toxic, I would do things I never wanted to do because I thought if I did not then it makes me a bad friend, and Id land up wanting to end these friendships and as a result of this conflicting thought Id not end the friendship correctly. Or Id land up hurting them in response to how hurt I felt by the way they treated me and feeling like they were superior to me. Because I did not have the guts to do it on my own.

Such as, ignoring me, never paying any attention to me, etc. 

I dated someone recently who played with my emotions and was manipulative but I took the blame that because of me its all my fault. 

Shortly after this, I had some weird revelation that none of this was my fault, and that I tried to handle situations the best I could because of what I was told. Which lead to me being taken advantage of and allowing people to manipulate me. I realized that what I experienced was not ok and that I am also a person and I have a right to put myself first before others. As long as I am respectful of others of course.
