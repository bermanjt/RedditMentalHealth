0,"I have been noticing that I am mentally calm in all ways, except that my body sweats a lot and my heart is elevated slightly whenever I’m near a stranger, such as waiting in line, crossing someone on the sidewalk, realizing there’s a car coming my way knowing that they’re looking at me, etc.
This interferes with my lifestyle because I tend to be alone because I’m less nervous alone. I like to go on walks, go to the grocery store and just do normal things. But I have the sweats and heart racing for the situations I described. Is anyone else experiencing this? I want it to go away.",10Jun2019,3
1,"Over the past few days I’ve gone through a lot of different emotions and it’s affecting my headspace negatively. I’ve been down on myself for a while and plagued with anxiety. My parents are constantly pissing me off because they are from an older generation that doesn’t understand how society works in 2019. On top of this my friends usually use me as the butt end of jokes or blame me for things, a stupid example is losing a game in Battlefield (I know it’s not really my fault and it doesn’t matter but it still gets to me). Moving on, I also have had no luck in the world of relationships as my one and only relationship ever (which lasted 9 months) ended almost 2 years ago and I still haven’t gone on a single date, which continuously eats at my conscious. I’m constantly getting berated by my parents to do more with my life, even though I’m on summer break and working two jobs currently before continuing my MBA in the Fall (I just graduated from undergrad and I’m only 21). Idk what I’m doing on here, maybe I just needed to rant, someone to talk to about all of it at once? I don’t know. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you if you got this far reading this :)",10Jun2019,1
2,"For years now, my life has been this cycle: Everything is falling apart, I realize that I'm not satisfied with my current situation, I start taking some actions but then I suddenly stop trying to improve myself without a reason. I eventually lose all the drive and energy to do anything, and everything is falling apart again.

What sucks is that I feel terrible about quitting and giving up, which makes my days even worse. Then it would takes me several months to start all over again, and the cycle is repeated.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I'm a super skinny guy. When I'm feeling good and ready to take actions again to get in shape, I would gain weight, but then I would feel too demotivated and sad to do any activity. I would lose my appetite and therefore, I lose all the weight that I worked hard to gain. 

This also extends to my attempts to build a relationship with many people, and worse, sometimes when I lose the drive to do anything, I would even deliberately stop taking my pills because I just don't want to.

&amp;#x200B;

For every time this happens, I feel super upset about it deep inside. It saddens me that I find myself with nobody to hang out with or talk to, find myself with a bad hygiene, and everything is simply not right. And whenever I open up with someone and talk about it, I feel like a big loser because I keep failing over and over again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know that I'm the only one to be held accountable and I'm the one responsible for having my life to be this way, but I just want to know can I stop this from happening all over again?

&amp;#x200B;

This period of time, I'm feeling like I'm between the two phases: even though I'm ready and willing to start all over again to improve my life deep inside, I'm still demotivated.

Does anyone else experience this? And what should I do about?",10Jun2019,1
3,"EARLY CHILDHOOD:
I have trouble concentrating, I always have. I’ve skipped class because I just needed to walk around and all that, and would always get in trouble for my low concentration and because I dyed my hair bright colours and stuff. I didn’t like group work either because I felt like people didn’t like me because I was neither one of the good kids nor the revered bullies.
I suffered with anxiety at the age of 8 about moving house and I felt the complications around the move caused my family to fall apart. I remember being very anxious, and still get anxiety attacks when people shout and argue. I’m 17 now. I felt like I was somehow different, maybe that I was a psychopath as I thought I had no emotions... I know now I do have emotions and I have a better grasp on psychology than I did back then. I still think my emotions are weird.

RECENTLY:
One of my friends went shoplifting and took me with her, and I found how easy it was and now I have stolen/illicitly obtained like $3,000 worth, calculating each amount and seemed somewhat addicted. Not full blown, but kinda addicted and had a lot of people who looked up to me for this, which felt nice but I still felt abnormal.
Around this time period, I got an eating disorder because I felt fat. I cut my calories and whilst I’m not at my lowest weight now but I’d like to be lower, still. I guess I still have an ED but I do want to return to when I solely had anorexic tendencies and was losing weight quickly and “easily”. I’m not overweight at all but sometimes if I don’t exercise because I’m tired my dad says I will stay “as I am” which makes me feel like he is calling me fat. What else could that mean? If I ever eat anything unhealthy (I weigh my lettuce and am the cleanest eater in the family), my dad will loosely tell me off and not bother to comment on it when my overweight brother, normal weight brother or underweight sister do the same, which confuses me.
I used to drink a lot of water a day since I was hungry but heard about the fact that there are chemicals in the water which make you dumb and I felt very lost and didn’t know what to do for a long time. I felt like I couldn’t even drink water. I also heard that the government was putting chemicals in the sky which scared me too. I seemed really untrusting in this time period... around last year. I still feel like those things may be true but I accept it since hey I’m not dead.

NOW:
I don’t feel like I am a person. I know I am one. I’m one person. All my memories and feelings are one. I don’t have multiple personalities but I have shifts. This has been the case since I was 2, and I made my parents sing happy birthday to a fictional character instead of to myself. I think that’s normal for a kid but I never grew out of it because I base my personalities off fictional characters I like and shift between them BUT it’s subconscious AND I don’t believe I am a different person. This makes dating hard because I fall in love in one mindset and then when it switches I want someone to better match my new mindset. These switches are slow and some of the old personas are discarded as my interests change. They have names and different aesthetics and social media’s but again I don’t switch on purpose and I am aware that I am always the same person with the same memories. The changes are subtle.
I still feel like there’s something wrong with me but I’m not sure what, especially since some of my weird traits are stronger in certain personas than others, especially since they’re usually based on characters. There have been times when I feel like I’ve had OCD because one of my retired personas was more like that?
I’m aware this sounds weird but I just feel like this is strange and I don’t know why I act like this.
I guess you could think I feel uncomfortable with who I am or something and I want to change something - which I do, all my personas have something in common that I don’t have in real life and I’m aware of what that is and what that part of it means and relates to but... why I have so many I don’t know? It’s not just that one thing or I’d just need one...

4,"I don´t know if this is the right sub for this or even what I am looing for but I got this issue on which I want a second oppinion.

The main issue I currently have is probably lonliness but maybe its also something else. I got this feeling since I finshed highschool in may. Don´t get me worng my school wasn´t my only social conection in life. I have some good friends I meet once or twice a week and I have some gaming friends with whom I play and chat almost daily (we also meet regularly in real life) I also have a good conection to my family so I haven´t lost my only connection to the outside world by leaving school. In fact I´ve never been popular or even conected in school I´ve also not been the social outcast  but still I didn´t expect that leaving school would effect me that strong in this way.

But even though I still have a social life and my socail life in school wasn´t that big of a deal. I still start to fell lonly and empty when I have nothing to do. (Which is happening quit often since without school I have not much to do till university starts in September.) This even goes so far by now that I can´t even watch Netflix or play a videogame by myself since I allways feel the need to do something nice/productive. Insteat I just lie around, scroll through reddit and Instagram and slep alot. I also started to walk around town by myself at night. (I don´t why or how it started but I felt it might be relevant)

My current theory on why this is happening is that by leaving school I lost on the one hand a way to communicate with people face to face on a daily bases which is something I can´t do with my online friends (for obvious reasons)and meet my real life friends to infrequent for. It also might have something to do with the fact that my friends are not ""strangers"" but this is something I haven´t really spent much thought on. On the other hand my days are also not structured anymore so I have no reason to something besides lying around in bed which is not really helping my situation.

7,"This was a really random passing thought I had in my late teenage life and it's never left me.

Does anyone else feel like this;
So there is the ""you"" on the outside. The part of you that acts without thinking, speaks without thinking and is essentially the driver behind the wheel of your body.

Then there is the ""you"" behind the eyes, if you like. That kind of inner monologue that helps you make decisions, determine right from wrong, answer questions ect... Like a backseat driver or those little angels and devil's on a cartoons shoulder :P 

Now most people I assume that, that is it. But what if the inside of your head feels like there is like 2 or 3 different inner monologues who most of the time will agree with each other but when your forced into a stressful situation or are feeling depressed or don't know what to do...

they argue with each other

And the ""you"" on the outside can't decide what to do because of all the conflict within and so either just acts or speaks without thinking or does nothing.

Every now and again in my life I have caught myself when home alone walking around talking to myself but in a 3 or 4 way conversation. 

Am I ""normal""? Possibly not. Do I want to be normal. No. Cause this is how I deal with life. I just need to be alone sometimes to kinda listen to the shitstorm in my head, process everything and calm things down again.

14,"Potential TW for description of sexual situations

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 21-year old man. I've had problems with anxiety ever since I was a kid, though in many other ways now.

I used to go to the psychiatrist when I was 15-16 for my social anxiety. I went to CBT- and counseling sessions almost weekly for about a year, but stopped going because I felt progress began to slow down before I started occasionally going to the school counselour once every couple of months.

These days I don't even know how to talk about it, or where to start. To be honest I don't really struggle much with social situations anymore, but I'm just anxiety-ridden overall. I've piled up so many thoughts and feelings and emotions over these past few years. I'm very bad at expressing myself through words so I feel like no matter how much I say it will only ever be just a tiny fraction of the entire picture. I spend hours everyday thinking up scenarios in my head like what would happen if I did this, what WILL happen because I did that. I constantly worry what my friends think of me, or what will happen to me in the future because I have a hard time with initiating things in life, etc.

Some of the things that worries me most is my romantic and sexual past. I've been in two relationships when I was younger where I was very neglectful and shitty to my partner at that time, behavior that I'd been called out on during the relationship. Also a few years back I tried to hook up with a friend who I had hooked up with once before, but I was really just misreading their signals. When we ended up sleeping in the same bed I tried to make the first move but after I had tried to fondle them they slapped my hand away and told me the next day that they were extremely uncomfortable with me. We've resolved it since then and are still very good friends. Sometime after this happened however they told about it to a mutual friend who promptly cut ties with me after this. They offered me a chance to explain myself, but I didn't and I've felt so bad about it since then. It's been a little over 2 years since then and I don't know If I can ever reach out to them again. I haven't told anyone else the whole story because I've felt so ashamed about it.

I've actively worked to better myself and my behavior after all of this, but I don't know if I can ever leave all of this behind me. I still think about it every day, like maybe I can't move on. I can't help but think it will all come back to bite me in the ass in the worst way possible way, and that I'd deserve what would come to me if it were to happen. That's how I see it in my head at least, I'm sure everyone has moved on with their lives since then but me. I have so many unresolved issues and thoughts that I feel like I shouldn't do anything about them. I mean, obviously I should, doing nothing is probably one of the most unhealthy things I can (or can't) do about my anxiety. But I just can't find the energy or willpower to talk to or book an appointment with someone. I'm not ready to commit to lengthy counseling sessions where I open up to some of the most vulnerable thoughts and feelings I have, it's intimidating. I've already told more in this post than what I've told most people I know. It's more intimate than I can handle. I feel like even if you beautiful souls give me advice or share life stories, I will still just be stuck in the same rut I've been these years. Sitting and thinking, and not doing anything. Because unless this goes away by itself, I'm gonna have to build up the courage to talk to a professional. Most of all I just want to know that I'm not alone in thinking like this, trapping myself with my thoughts in an endless cycle. 

Thank you so much in advance.",10Jun2019,1

17,"I won’t allow myself to touch my expensive computer without washing my hands and cleaning the surface I set it on. That behavior is hurting me academically, socially and career wise. 

Here’s how I experience this at college: (I’m not joking)

1. Find a somewhat clean surface to do studying: go to desks/tables and shine my iPhone light to check for any shininess (oil). If that passes, “wipe” down the surface with the side of my right and left hand. If my hand feels any oily or stickiness or my hand smells (ex like pb), try a different place.

2. Clean the surface: using a wet paper towel or cleaning wipes, wipe down the surface for at least 2 times.

3. Leave to wash your hands: set backpack in another chair next to the seat I intend to sit at to make sure no one sits next to me.

4. Wash hands and return: wash hands for at least two times and use only paper towels to dry. Then use the paper towel to open the bathroom door and throw into the trash can. Avoid touching anything until I return to seat.

5. Move seat and take out computer: using my knuckles push the seat closer to the surface. Finally grab my laptop case, take the laptop out, and set it on the surface.


This is only part of what I do throughout the day. (Ex I’ll avoid peanut butter, ketchup, and onions because the smell sticks to my hands even after washing my hands.)

I’m not sure if I’m technically suicidal. I don’t want to live anymore. I wish I was never born. I’m not going to hurt myself. I just wish I’d never wake up, or could just disappear. The thought of the couple people who care about me finding me or EMT/police/fireman having to clean up my mess will keep me from hurting myself.

22,"TL:DR at bottom but I reccomend reading the whole thing.

First off not me but my girlfriend(16). She has told me she has crippling depression/anxiety/PTSD/ADHD at the ""top of all charts,"" I'm not really well versed in these charts nor do I even know what they test. So the story, basically my girlfriend supposedly went through something Friday night. I say something because I literally have no idea what happened, but earlier that night she posted stuff on Snapchat saying that her friend wouldn't even thank her for something she did on her proudest day, I thought it was HS drama and we talked for a bit but suddenly she took a turn telling me to leave her alone and don't talk to her. Again believing it wasn't anything big I told her I loved her and went to bed. Next morning I go to work and on break I see that one of her friends has taken over her streaks(person I'll call S), when I asked S what was wrong she said my gf was in the hospital, and could not remember anything other than motor functions and her own name, S kept me updated but I was immediately skeptical. Today was the first day I talked to my gf after this incident but she said that S had her phone, S is from a Pacific Northwest state, me and my gf are in the southeast USA, and all of us are 16, I have trouble believing that S was able to get a flight(alone, I asked, her parents didn't come) on a whim in one day. When I talked to my GF she said she didn't remember me, and took a hostile tone, then S suddenly took the phone back and said my gf went mentally unresponsive, they took her back to the hospital (gf was there Saturday). S is pissed, so she blocked me on everything in gf's phone and now I have no contact. I honestly don't know what to think, this situation sounds so unrealistic but I know my gf has severe depression, I've helped and been with her through episodes, but this is a whole new level. My question being, is this something possible at such a young age, can I get a medical term for it, and should I do anything myself?

* mind fog
* can't focus
* often start to fall asleep after studying/working for 30 minutes
* have to re-read a paragraph 3 to 4 times to understand what's going on
* very indecisive on big things as well as small things (don't know what is the next activity to do or next place to go)

24,"I've had trouble with sleep since childhood (I'm in my late 20s now). I work full time and, 95% of work nights, I only end up getting 3-5 hours of sleep. This is really affecting my quality of life as I feel worn out and unwell daily. I've tried many over the counter sleep aids and they don't help, mainly because this is likely a psychological issue. I don't have too much trouble falling asleep, moreso many bad habits that cause me to put off going to bed on time. 

I have a lot of anxiety about having to face each new day, people or my job. Because of this, I often waste time reading or watching shows late into the night just because I'm terrified of going to sleep and having my next moment of consciousness be having to go to work and face the world again. I guess these late night activities are things that I genuinely enjoy which I try to pack into my experiences before I have to live out most of my day doing things I do not enjoy or find fulfilling. 

This has nothing to do with anything bad about my job or social circle. My job and colleagues are fine, and I'm actually good at faking happiness and am somewhat popular and sociable at work. This anxiousness over having to face the ""outside world"" has followed me through various schools/jobs/life stages. Apart from terrible sleep, it has also resulted in other terrible habits such as an extremely poor diet and poor self care. Therapy is off the table for now as I do not have time off from work left.

25,"I'm kinda concerned with how my brother has gone from extremely outgoing to literally never saying a word to even his former friends now. He is currently 18, but I began noticing subtly strange behavior earlier in high school. He had a reputation of being a class clown, and at some point, he began to lose the ability to say yes or no. If you'd ask him a yes or no question, he'd mumble very quietly. He also struggled in school academically, and his clowny antics got him in trouble alot, so 3 years ago, my parents brought him into homeschooling. From there, he'd been physically cut off from his friends most of the time, but he still spoke to them alone back then. Over time, this seems to have stopped as I never hear him talking anymore. He also rarely says words to anyone in the family, and he's developed very strange ways of communicating. If we have to bring him somewhere, he'll hide in his closet or lay down on the floor in his room or do other very strange behaviors. A few days ago, my family was doing grocery shopping, and we were telling him to come. All of us where in the car, waiting on him, but he wouldn't come, so I went to check on him. I found him in the laundry room crouching by the laundry machine. 

Also not sure if relevant, but my parents bring in a doctor to come check on him once a week. It is confirmed that he has OCD and autism, and he spends hours in the bathroom, inconveniencing everyone, although that's more of a vent on my part.

He's not the person I knew a few years ago now.

26,"First off, thanks for taking the time to read this, first timer poster.

&amp;#x200B;

Details: I am a recent college grad as of May 2019.  I completed my degree in Chemical Engineering from a reputable university and was fortunate enough to land a full time engineering job out of school.  About two years ago, I began using exercise and physical exertion as a means of managing sadness, stress, anger, pretty much any troubling emotion. I've been involved in Tae-Kwon-Do since I was a kid and have been running long distance since middle school.  Two years ago I also got pretty seriously into weight lifting.  Then, more recently, I have picked up kick boxing, jiu jitsu and some occasional rock climbing.  As time goes on, I have found that all these sports/activities etc. haven't really been relieving frustration and negative emotion like they used to.  Lately, they've been causing me more problems than they've been solving.  If I miss a workout/run/practice, I feel guilty and angry that I am letting myself get behind.  If I show up, I often feel angry I haven't made the kind of progress I want or that I've let myself plateau/fall behind.  I just recently started to become aware of how unhealthy this whole situation is and how I have worked myself into a no-win scenario when it comes to all this exercise.  I should also mention I used to really enjoy video games, movies, and tv shows as a way to unwind and decompress but all of that has become pretty lackluster to me as well lately.

&amp;#x200B;

My Question(TLDR):  Does anyone have some suggestions for unique or creative ways to manage difficult emotions?  I've googled this problem a thousand times and, often, the first suggestion on the list is exercise which causes me to scream a little internally.  Again, thank you for your time and consideration.

28,"I’ve been struggling with an eating disorder most of my life. Since beginning treatment relapse and recovery have come in waves. I’ve been mostly ok for the past year with a few episodes of symptom usage, until the last few weeks. 

With the start of warm weather came the need to address the idea of wearing shorts (today was 90 with 60% humidity). I’m doing I managed to realize that I had gained a lot of weight in the past year. My treatment team has tried to play it off but it’s alarming and I don’t think it’s healthy (my BMI is not in a healthy range and I’m not muscular). 

Between finals for school, taking an incomplete in a class, being a single mom (on disability) to a six year old, and a bunch of little things that have mounted up I’ve relapsed. 

I was out to dinner with friends from my son’s school and used a behavior I’d not used in public before (not purging). Yesterday, on a field trip I tried not to eat lunch and then felt like I had to and used typical to me behaviors to compensate. I think tonight’s dinner was kind of an “oh shit, what the fuck am I doing” moment. 

I know that I need to be honest with my team but the thought of staying at my current weight is paralyzing. I’m not sure I want to stop. Plus, if I tell my team they could take away my current medication that has been somewhat helping. 

I’m so sick of being me.",10Jun2019,1
29,"Hello nice to meet you, 
I’ve gone through a lot lately, I’m not sure what it is or how to explain it. I’m not the same person I used to be and I don’t know how to be that person again. I used to love hanging out with people, and being around friends would energize me. Now all I do is sit at home and I’m content. I lost a lot of friends lately, and I really only talk to myself about my own problems. I’m more than upset with how my life is going, but it seems to be spiraling into sadness. Anytime I try to talk to someone else about my issues, it’s “how are yOU stressed?” “You have no reason to be sad”. I can’t even talk to someone without someone competing me. At this point I feel like I’ve lost everything, my boyfriend, my friends and myself. How do you cope with outer stressors, how do you alleviate emotional pain?",10Jun2019,2
30,"I've currently got so much stuff going on I'm my mind right now, and I feel like I have no control anymore. I'm an 18 year old Male who is about to go to college in a couple months, but I dont k ow how I will make it through the summer. I feel like if I go really in depth about the stuff in my head, then I could write for hours, so I'm just gonna list everything out. 

- I have had self esteem problems for as long as I can remember.
- I feel extremely lonely all the time, and try desperately to be around my friends, but it never feels like its enoign
- I have depression which just makes me feel overall worse and like there is no hope. 
- I have terrible anxiety that comes in waves and leaves me feeling hopeless
- I have an addiction to pornography that adds on to the self esteem and gives me ""brainfog"" 
- I have had feelings for a friend and was rejected by her. She has already left for college and I am still not over this. She is always on my mind and I feel terrible about not getting to even be around her anymore. This makes everything feel worse and really amplifies my loneliness
- I feel like my entire life I have been living on autopilot, and I have no idea who I really am or what makes me happy
- sometimes I feel like I dont even want to get better, because the effort would be too much. I would rather just lay in bed and cry about it. 


All of this typically hits me at the same time, and leaves my feeling like there is nothing I can do to improve. I have no hope right now, and I have been close to killing myself recently. I have talked to friends about this, and while they support me and give me advice, nothing really helps. Even though I think that I know what is going on in my head, I feel utterly powerless and have no idea what to do. Suicide is almost always on my mind, and I'm worried that I wont make it through the summer. I feel scared and alone and really need some help.",10Jun2019,1

I recently graduated high school, and I expected a lot of emotions. Mainly, dread about leaving my friends who have supported me through the years. Without them, I wouldn't be alive today. But the emotions I'm feeling aren't quite like that.

&amp;#x200B;

These past few weeks, a lot has happened in my friends' lives. Stuff I won't get into for the sake of keeping them from reading this and recognizing who it is. But it's gotten to the point where all I can think about is the fact that I never seem to be anyone's favorite. I'm always second to someone else. Which sounds selfish, I know, but the problem is...I'm the kind of person to throw my whole self into a friendship. I love my friends deeply and hard and intensely. I would do anything for them. 

&amp;#x200B;

They aren't trying to be mean or anything. One even double-checked with me to make sure I knew they would always care about me and they couldn't replace me. But the words don't replace the feelings, yknow??

&amp;#x200B;

There was a bit of a situation at my work tonight. Nothing terrible, but we had to evacuate. Twice. I have anxiety, so my first reaction the first time around was just super anxious. Everyone was really kind and watched out for me. The second time around, I knew what to expect, and was fine, but I for some reason got really depressed later on in the night. When I left, I felt terrible. I love my coworkers. So, so, so much. And for me to add onto the burden of having to deal with everything, to once again make everything about me? It just made me feel terrible. And, once again, really exacerbated those feelings I'd been having.

39,"My mental health is declining, and I know that I won't last much longer if something doesn't change. I feel as if I need to check myself for some inpatient mental health facility somewhere, but I'm worried for several reasons:

1. I'm worried that it'll worsen my mental state (that's based mostly on stigma and heresay)

2. I'm worried that it'll do little or nothing for me but cost a lot (especially since I currently have no insurance)

My suicidality is worsening, and my avoidance personality disorder and self isolating c-ptsd is making it near impossible to open up about it to anyone close to me.

I am an 18 year old male living in the United States, and I would like to go to a therapist to talk about issues I am having. However, I don’t want my parents to know I’m getting help. I know it sounds stupid, but I just feel like they’ll treat me differently the rest of my life if my mental health isn’t perfect.

It’s not because my parents are abusive or anything like that, but I’ve been that “picture perfect” child my whole life, and I don’t want to disappoint. Good grades, varsity athlete, non- trouble maker etc. I feel like it would make them feel like they had failed. I love them to death and I don’t want that. 

I’ve been having troubles with my anxiety (never been clinically diagnosed though) I’ve been worrying noticeably more about little things, and it’s especially effecting relationships with friends and others. I had what I felt like were panic attacks before a couple of my college level course tests this spring. I couldn’t breath and I needed to go hide in the bathroom for a little to contain myself. I also feel like I’ve  become uninterested in everything . I don’t like doing things I used to, and when I rarely do them I get uninterested fast. I just don’t know what’s going on.  It’s become increasingly worse over this summer, and I need to get it off my chest. 

I’ve tried talking to friends about it, but I don’t like putting the burden of my emotions on them. It doesn’t feel right to me.

Anyways, I am seeking help because I would like to find a way to contact a professional therapist without it going on their insurance. Or at least enough sessions so I can get the guts to talk to them about it. I am also leaving for college at the end of August, so I don’t know if I should wait till then and use their services or not. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.",10Jun2019,11

44,"Imposter syndrome. I’ll be hiding my name as Jake for now. Growing up I had a violent childhood, having parents that use me as a  “golden child”. I’ll be their face for everyone else outside of the family, if I follow what they want I’ll be treated as a regular child (though I needed to act as pristine and perfect as possible) if I don’t I’ll be put into mental and physical abuse. My grandfather would throw me around in the living room if I “disobeyed my mom” or “ didn’t reach up to her standards”, I grew up hating the dark due to him locking me into the dark bathroom (the light switch was outside the bathroom door). I still remember screaming and crying each time he throws me inside the bathroom, trying to hold my sanity, trying to push away the fear the dark. I was thought to be superstitious growing up, how demons, ghosts existed and followed children who were naughty. I remember drawing on the floor with my crayons, next thing I remember my mouth was bleeding from him kicking me on the face. My mom would put me into mental abuse, each time I show any warmth or love to her she would use it against me this has thought me to hold my love and warmth to everybody around me or they’re gonna use it against me. This made it really hard to open up to people, find people to date, trust, and get close to. My parents had their divorce when I was only 3 years old, my mom’s family has taught me to get angry and despise my dads side of the family. For a chunk of my childhood I hated his side, only to find the truth after my grandfather on my dads side explain everything to me. This grandfather taught me sympathy, opened my eyes to what my mom was trying to brainwash me. I quickly grew to like this grandfather showed me how a family should show love, but this quickly got destroyed; after 6 months of enjoying this love he became really sick, my mom cheering on how he’s dying but my dad would be crying. I was just confused, I didn’t know what was happening, I thought he would get better and come back home, I didn’t see what happened after and he was still in that hospital bed after my mom took me for the weekday. The only guy that showed me some light just died, and I’m not sure why my mom is very spiteful of him. This happened even before I turned 10. Skip to a few more years, maybe skip to 7 years. My first year of post secondary, my first and their first love as you may say. For half a year everything went well, everything was the best feeling I’ve ever had. Only to get destroyed by a Christmas dinner. This person taught me I was worth something, that I deserve someone that would treat me like a person, not the other guys I’ve met before. The best quote they’ve said (you have all the things you need, to make the world your bitch). I was lost for a while, just jumping from guy-to-guy looking for the same feeling I’ve lost. During my second year of post secondary I was sexually assaulted by this exchange student, I was trying to be nice, trying to be comfortable, forcing myself to enjoy this “experience”.. Once I got home I just broke down into tears, remembering that always make me feel dirty and nauseous about myself. Working during the summer, I always feared giant men, loud sounds and bangs, the dark, reliving each moment whenever I sleep and the fear of isolation; this I learnt that this is called PTSD. Scary to say, but I lived through Pavlov’s law. I.was.treated.like.a.dog. Not until recently I was given a few medications, an anti-psych, mood stabilizers, some anti-depressants, and some stimulants to battle the anti-psych morning grogginess. I’m not sure where I’ll be in 10-20 years, and I fear that considering what state I am during the present. I see myself as broken, though I want to show a good face.

46,"  I know there is something seriously wrong with me. I have so many issues i dont even know how to explain it all. I have trouble getting schoolwork done. I can't seem to ever stay focused or on track. And I can't seem stop procrastinating and being lazy. I've tried everything and nothing has worked. On top of this, I get really lonely at times because I have never really had friends, except a long time ago when I was a little kid. This is because I've been homeschooled for almost my whole life and I live far from town. I have 2 friends now online that i want to meet someday in person but im afraid to.  As a result of all of this, I am very awkward and don't know how to talk to people in person. I also hit, scratch, pinch and harm myself at times because I either feel so down that hurting myself brings relief or because I hate the person I am.

  The reason that I say that there is something seriously wrong with me is because these are not the worst of my issues. I have sexual fantasies of touching people inappropriately and to spy on people when undressing or doing sexual acts. I try to resist my urges but there were occasions where I acted on impulse. One time I actually touched someone's butt. I also spied on people in showers a few times or changing or doing sexual acts. I've also gone through people's underwear drawers and even tried them on and masturbated with them. I have not done anything in awhile and have been working really hard at resisting my urges. However, I'm afraid that I will act on impulse again. I also have lots of intrusive thoughts of doing these things, but the thing is that these thoughts actually arouse me and I get urges. I understand that you need to respect women and their privacy and that doing these things is wrong. This is the reason I have not acted on it recently, because I don't want to harm people or invade anyone's privacy. However, I still get these urges and still get aroused and fantasize about these things. I'm scared I will act on impulse again.

  I feel like such a psychopath and pervert. I don't want to be like this. I don't want to be a rapist or psychopath. I know I need help but I can't.

54,"I’ve been going through the classic utter bullshit of life atm, cutting off close friends, ocd and anxiety,  identity issues.  I knew I’d be okay once I had some therapy set in place, started my degree in acting (which I spent 3 years auditioning for and I love to the moon and back) and made some new friends, lived from parents etc. Once September started it would all be okay, but for now I made every excuse to not care about my life because the external situations were fucking me right up.  It’s lazy, and yes while I know my life will be majorly changed come September, I can’t waste month’s waiting for anything. I must bring change in myself.
I was asking for reassurance from my boyfriend yesterday, and after feeling like he was tired of giving it, I told him he didn’t have to put up with it and he could break up with me, and not to worry if he wanted to. Of course I think I was just unintentionally testing him, but it made him think and made him realise he needs “to focus on himself”.
Now, being in a relationship should never stop you from that, and I’ve realised I’ve given him more responsibility and added little to his life since I’m just taking all the time, asking for help. I am barely even a quarter of my full self.  Somebody who is very independent and self loving needs somebody similar, he’s going through a lot of change and he’s at a different point of his life to where I am . He’s not looking for somebody else and says I’m amazing and is the only person that would ever be worth being in a relationship for. 
Now of course I feel DEVASTATED, at first suicidal (still a bit) , and in my head all I hear is the abandonment siren. This person is my best friend, the most inspiring person I’ve ever met, my creative partner,  and the one person I have a connection with and trust more than anybody else I know. He’s helped me come so much further in my life and has encouraged me to seek the best version of myself. I had never had that encouragement from anyone, before I knew him I was so ignorant, and completely destructive and people close to me encouraged and supported this behaviour. 
We’ve been together about a year and a half almost two year.
The devastation has literally kicked me up the ass and said YOU HAVE SPENT YEARS LETTING YOUR BRAIN MAKE YOU BELIEVE YOU ARE NOT SHIT AND THAT YOU ARE NOT IN CONTROL.  I was literally wailing in pain from the thought of him not being in my life.  It hurts me so deeply I can’t really comprehend, but the fact that it does highlights to me- Where the fuck is the trust and love for myself?
I’m sad that it takes this kind of thing to force me into working hard on myself. I never ever have this kind of desire or motivation otherwise, unless I’m really happy and in a structure.
We both knew that being single would be the fastest route to me becoming more independent and loving to myself, but it’s absolutely devastating because i want to do it with him by my side.  I want him to be patient while I become the best and most powerful version of myself. I know I can do it. But I haven’t been dedicated , or caring, I let everything outside me let me care less about myself and my life. 
I wish I met my love with more self knowledge, and work, because he is the person I want to be with.
WHY HAS IT TAKEN SO MUCH FUCKING DEVASTATION TO FORCE ME TO SEE HOW NEGLECTFUL I AM OF MYSELF.  it’s made me care less about validation, I’ve deleted all social media, I’ve bought self care books. I’ve made sleep routines. I’ve decided to eat healthily.
I feel like without the fear and devastation I can’t care for my life and that scares me. Although this scared me too because I’m alternating between dedication to self patience and love alongside suicidal thoughts and defeat. 

When I let go of somebody I must do it for good, and that’s what scares me, I can’t cling on to hope, I can’t have a friendship for a very very long time, and I can’t really speak to them for a very long time. This IS MAJOR for me because break up for me means gone forever. Which is why I become very fearful.  That fear is driving me, and destroying me.

Eventually I found the “perfect” match, some kind of a borderline narcissistic alcoholic. Quite the catch from Monday to Friday and then an F5 hurricane over the weekends, so to speak. Due to my submissive personality at the time, that didn’t end well, more like “who am I, why don’t I go homeless for eight months to try and figure that out.”

Right before I walked out, I sought refuge over Christmas 2014 at a psychiatric hospital, only to relax. Some girl nurse student or whatever in her early twenties asked some questions from a single page questionnaire, it took like 15 minutes I guess. I was barely present and just numbly said yes and no to some questions about how I had been doing the past few weeks, trying to co-operate, half asleep and totally neurotic.

The following day, the chief doctor comes in and says “I have read the answers and you have Bi-Polar. Let’s talk about medication. Did you know that many high achievers like lawyers and doctors can do their jobs under very stressful conditions on these medications?”
I remember thinking: “I’m a forklift driver and a hobby guitarist...”

I decided to decline their offer of starting immediately on the Bi-Polar path, because it all felt very express like and not that thorough.
Few months later, I spoke a few times with a psychiatrist at the rehab center and he said that Bi-Polar was bs. and sent in an order for a personality disorder check.

My own doctor, who practices family medicine, you know, your child has hay fever and she’s the first line of contact, that doctor overturned that to Bi-Polar. I went to a group and it made no sense whatsoever. “Manias, that’s just worrying and ruminating thoughts, why the big deal? Don’t we all feel a bit more uptempo in the summer than in January here in the Nordic countries? Don’t people generally dance more on Friday nights than Monday mornings?”

They kept asking these leading questions and I did try to be honest all the time, but I could feel that they were fishing for something else than the truth, so I began playing along, just to get a break. Manipulative people aren’t exactly my favorites, so I lied to get out of there, even told them so, that they were too much and I needed a break.

One day I went there again because I had been suicidal and wanted help. I had been smoking tons of marijuana and they said that for weed withdrawals and as a sleeping pill, the best option was Quitepin/Seroquel. I googled it first and found out it was an anti-psychotic. Reluctantly, I decided to give it a shot. Well, it certainly gave me six weeks of psychosis, something I had never experienced before.

So many of my close friends and family kept pressuring me with their insight: “You have a genetic disease and you need medication.” None of them knew shit, and none of them had been spending dozens of hours investigating Bi-Polar on all kinds of platforms, reading other people’s accounts, listening to psychiatric professionals describing this thing. Some even became Bi-Polar experts: “I am Bi-Polar and so are you, how otherwise can you play music for four hours in the streets?” - “Uh, perhaps because I’ve played four hours on average every day for the past 20+ years and love doing it?” I’m not going to lie, four hours busking is VERY tiring, because it’s outside, but I needed the money and it’s fun. That person’s statement went into my journal as a proof for the initial diagnosis. For real.

Social workers are quite the psychiatrists as well. One claimed me being depressed and I should get medication. Another one said I’m BPD, then there was this and that.

Finally after seriously screwing up my life because I couldn’t get any understanding that this thing needs to be investigated more, I am at the psychiatric hospital, and the doctor here wa very skeptical about it being a mental illness, hence he has asked that I be checked for a, yes, a personality disorder. 

A now former friend was here the other day, basing her expertise on her depression, that I of course have a with-born/genetic illness and can’t get better unless I take medication. She did take a few weeks of mindfulness coach education, so how could she be wrong?

My parents are definitely thrilled at any news that there is no personality disorder, with it’s roots in their parenting, but yes, indeed, a genetic illness that will simply vanish with medication.

Personally, I don’t care what it is, I just want to get better. If a pill can get it done, I’m definitely trying that out. However, not before the real experts have come to a conclusion.

I cut ties with my parents and siblings some months ago. Met my ex narc recently, got drunk and went suicidal. Two cops tried to stop me, I wasn’t having it because after all these years, my brain feels like it will just stop and I will die from a stroke or something. It had become two much. They threw me into detention for 13 hours, kept waking me up with loud random noises to show me who’s the boss and eventually muted the emergency button and black mirrored me. Just the thought of a police officer makes me sick. First time ever I feel unsafe in Denmark. Dreamt about it last night, it’s haunting me, and it overlaps with other worries, bringing on these panic attacks where you momentarily fade into like a dream state, hyperventilating. I know where I am, just stuck inside my own head. Then everything goes totally quiet and I wake up again, which has happened hundreds of times since that crazy narc relationship. Even my hands used to become long and thin, like a hallucination of reality.


Suddenly my family is all caring and ready to flash the cash, reminding me, through my former friend, that I have a genetic condition which will go away with pills...

Almost like living in a dream, the denial is unreal.

57,"When we were going out last week, I first learnt about my friend's borderline when she had a short breakdown mentioning how she doesn't like the way she looks, moves and talks, that she still cuts on her upper leg, that she was in a mental clinic for half a year and is looking for a healthcare-paid therapist at the moment.

For context, I do have romantic feelings for my friend, but don't know her that well because I was too scared to approach her until recently. But it just gives me heartaches to see someone so wonderful to me in such pain. So I'd like some tips on how I can support her because even if I fall into the friend zone I want her to be well.

Also, I heard from another former love interest that had mental health issues (manic depression iirc) that borderline people can be problematic if your own mental health isn't bulletproof, because when she first got into a mental health clinic a borderliner convinced her to try cutting. I myself am not diagnosed but mostly have some insecurity issues (it took me about a year of silent admiring to actually approach my BPD friend). So is there a risk in trying to build a relationship or does my friend have negative bias?",10Jun2019,1

Do any of you feel like you should tell someone that you’re struggling a little bit, but whenever the opportunity arises to express you’re feelings, you just blow it off?

62,"For some context, my best friend's twin brother is in the hospital for some serious shit. My best friend (Matt) lives in the midwest (US) where we met at school, I live on the west coast, and his brother (Dan) lives on the east coast, so we're pretty spread out. I was actually visiting Matt a few weeks back when Dan called saying he was admitted to a psych ward. Matt was obviously distressed and didn't want to talk about it, which I understood and respected. It was hard though because our relationship has always been transparent, but I figured he'd share when he's ready. Matt took his fear and frustrations out on me, which wasn't cool, but I understood. I tried to walk him home but instead he yelled at me and got black out drunk. Given his (unadmitted) struggles with alcoholism, it was hard to watch.

Fast forward to this past week, Matt and his family were flying over to Dan for his graduation, he was ready to be let out of the psych ward and they were all really excited to see him. An hour before Matt's flight, he gets a call that Dan had been transferred from the psych ward to the ER due to a sudden serious condition. I was fucking terrified. Matt still hadn't told me anything about Dan's original admission, so all of these thoughts were flying through my head, but even then I was so much more concerned about them than I was me. But over the past few days, all of these self-loathing, insecure thoughts are crossing my mind. Of course I am still genuinely worried about Matt, Dan, and their family, but I can't lie I am incredibly hurt that I can't know any of it. I want to be the best friend I can be, and he says I can do that by respecting their privacy.

But I'm having such a hard fucking time. Like I said, we don't keep that much from each other, so I'm not used to being kept so far away. I've been doing a good job about not pressing for what exactly is going on with Dan, but my anxiety is running wild. So many possibilities and scenarios I've created with my limited information, and I'm concerned that Matt will throw away everything he has in the midwest for his brother and that scares me, too. I mean, what would that do to our already difficult long-distance friendship? We've been getting closer again since his turn to alcoholism and honestly I am afraid of losing him again. Which makes me feel like shit because I'm making this traumatic event about me.

There are so many moments where I think ""why aren't I good enough? Why doesn't he want me involved?"" And I feel so selfish. His brother is in the hospital, they don't know for how long, after 2+ weeks in a psych ward and I'm getting upset because I don't feel involved. Who the fuck do I think I am. 

Today Matt told me that he's been hanging out with some of Dan's friends, and that it's been a really nice distraction from everything. And all I could think was ""but why couldn't you hang out with me to distract yourself? Why are they better than me?"" instead of just being fucking relieved that for the first time in days he can relax for a little while.

I guess it's like... I get wanting to spend time with his family, and his twin in particular, at a time like this. But I'm his best friend. Why doesn't he go to me when he needs a break?

I feel so pathetic and needy and insecure and like a shit friend and it makes me hate myself so much which makes me an even worse support to Matt. Idk. I am just conflicted between wanting to respect his wishes and hating myself for not wanting to respect his wishes. I mean, I am also just terrified by the situation in general, their whole family means so much to me. I don't want to lose any of them. Lots of negative juju up in here rn.

For example when I was maybe 12 I would find it fun to ride my bike down a busy street with my eyes closed...  And now I find it exciting when im in a car going 180 down a windy street, in fact what goes through my head in those moments is that “if I’m going to die right now I’m okay with that..” and that thought goes through my head a lot in highly dangerous situations that I purposely put myself into.

71,"For about 22 years I've been through the mental health system. I'm 40 now. My life has had it's ups and downs. Mostly downs.
I'm on disability, i have clinical depression, anxiety and ptsd, high functioning autism.

A couple years back i ended up moving back home after living on my own for 8 years. 
Recently i went through a break up which is really killing me as i truly care and love the woman; we both are lesbians and have our seperate mental problems. She's blessed to have a family who is supportive of her, yet her life isn't perfect either.
I was okay before i reconnected with her, i was used to being alone and did miss human connection and the feeling of being loved/cared about. Now it feels as if i was better off never even getting a taste of being loved again since it's gone. Not her fault, mine. I broke up with her since i felt she was with me just to be with somebody and just took me for granted despite saying she loved me. At first i was angry (basis of hurt) yet now I hold no grudges, as we each have our own issues.
My mother has a wicked way of showing she cares (she takes everything personally) or she shrugs off my issues as if it doesn't phase her so we get into arguments.
I've been seriously depressed worse after the break up with my exgf. The only thing keeping me going are my cats, who rely on me and depend on me. My mother reassures me they are safe here (they are yet were something to happen to me they wouldn't be the same, they'd miss their mama). I don't care how pathetic i sound. There's only so much i can take of barely functioning daily. I can hardly make it through a day. I don't sleep at night since it's the only peace i get away from my mother.
Been trying to look for a therapist again. Years back i had been through a ton until i finally found an awesome psychologist and went to him for years until he retired. He was like a second father to me. I'm scared i won't find another like him, yet willing to try to look.
My depression is so bad I've no motivation for anything. My mom keeps getting on me to sell stuff yet i lack the confidence or motivation to figure out Ebay.

When i was with my exgf i had actually felt a lot better, she brought out my good qualities. Now I've been at a loss and it feels like everyday is a fight for survival to the point i feel physically ill.

Honestly, I'm not even sure what i mean to ask or why I'm posting this.

Old hobbies i had no longer interest me. After the break up I've been left more broken. I really loved her yet she didn't feel the same fir me even though she always said she loved me, her actions betrayed her words.

I can't talk to my mother, she belittles by opinions if things and says ""i hear you"" yet she sure as hell doesn't feel my pain and she's got a master's in psychology.

Tired of living. It's a daily struggle. My only concern is my fur babies. 
I really miss mu exgf and would appreciate a friendship with her, yet I've been told by other's she's not worth it. I beg to differ. The few fair weather friends i have i can't talk to, they hate drama and i rarely see them. I've got dentures (top only). My life in a mess. My social skills are poor and i don't even have the motivation to go out and make friends. I wrote my exgf in detail explaining how hurt i was and that's why i broke it off, i even tried texting her mom. It's evident she never cared about me and was only in love with the concept of love.
I'm ready to bite the bullet most the time.

Watching YouTube, going out, cleaning the house Ect, will not rid me of this cycle in my head. i can’t breathe over it. I’ve gone to one session of therapy and that’s it so far but I can’t get out of my head. It makes life seem so pointless and repetitive and scary. You learn how to drive, you get a car, you work and work and then you die. Has anyone with anxiety ever felt this? Anyone experienced anything similar with phobia of death?  its the worst right when I wake up, it’s like I wake up in the middle of the morning (6am ish) because of it and then i panic my Zoloft isn’t working/kicking in so I go eat a snack to take my medicine.

By that I mean she says I’m perfectly normal (and I know too) but I’ve been going for some reasons and they’ve all been taken care of. If you want some background you should read the next paragraph but if you don’t have time definitely skip to last 2 paragraphs. 

•The first 6 or so sessions was when I was 12 (I’m 17 now) and it was because it was free and she is a great friend of mine. Only concern she had about me that I could be a perfectionist when I grew up and it might cause problems. Thank God she says it isn’t a big deal as it was back then. Hurray!

• Second time was when I was 15-16 and I was feeling lonely and depressed. I went and stayed for also fixing my characteristic problems (perfectionist and some other things) I went for about 12 sessions then I graduated(that’s what we like to call it lol) because she’s working for a diffirent clinic and she’s expensive. 

• Third time is now and it’s because I went through something nearly traumatic for me and was having some sort of panic attack thingy(very much like it but a little less effective). She worked miracally on me and we got it fixed in 3 sessions! (First one was highly effective but I wanted to make sure it went away). Didn’t have any of those for a long time now. But I’m still seeing her because we’re working on stuff like getting the most out of my studies, focusing, mindfullness excersizes(?) and so on. I can stop seeing whenever I want as she calls it and I’m actually planning to do that tomorrow but I have a huge concern. 

Now as I mentioned we both think it’s okay for me to leave even though I want to visit her every 2 weeks because she’s awesome and I get to learn things about myself too. But I lied big time and I don’t know if I should keep this away from her. So this is how “the lie” got big and I don’t know if I should tell her. 

2 months ago I had a power duel (I don’t know how this translates) with the school president. And I chose to surrender because if I had won I was gonna do big damages to his image and also the school. But after getting out of this fight I felt like he won and since he’s in my class I made a lie to show him I’m pretty powerful on my own and he should acknowledge it. The lie is that I have 20k$ overseas that I made through stocks with my freelance money over a year (I’m good at financial things so it was believable). And as you can see the lie is pretty big and it scares me. I know that it’s a lie. I don’t believe it and acknowledge how bad it is. My pschologyst doesn’t know this. The lie is also pretty detailed because I don’t wanna be exposed and it’s known by my friends (how I have 20k but they don’t know it’s a lie) and just a few of the friends. The reason I’m coming here is to know if I am going crazy. Because I’ve been told that I need to see a psychatrist by 2 people who dislike me and I got it verified by my pschologyst that I’m not mentally ill. 

But she doesn’t know this and I’m scared if I’m mentally ill (this lie concerns me). But I’ll put and end to it so it’s never spoken again. I’ll tell my friends something like I deposited the money and paid some of my parents debts. But I’m concerned. Please give advice I’m desperate. 

Also forgive me for bad grammer and typing mistakes. I’m not native. Also I live at Europe and by overseas I meant US",10Jun2019,1
82,"Hello there,im only 17 and i have extreme anger issues,i get so f***ing angry even without a reason,i cant control it.Worst of this is that i always bite my fingers when i am angry,to the point where i left scars on them and i also hurt myself or other people..I tried going to a psychologist,but i realised it didnt help me even a bit...

84,"So a few weeks ago my daughter overdosed on pills. She had a seizure, survived and spent some time in the hospital. She has also started an intensive outpatient program.
Before that incident, and even more now, I am continuously walking on eggshells trying not to say something to push her over the edge. When she took the pills a few weeks ago it was because I got on to her for her attitude toward her boyfriend.

I understand that she is going through a lot as myself I struggled through depression, anxiety and suicidal ideations all my life. However, with that being said, her attitude toward me and other people is really not appropriate. She is just very rude when she speaks. This is not like her at all. She tries to tell me she don't have an attitude but she does.

Each time she shuts me out or is rude to me I feel like it's pushing me closer to not wanting to be here because she makes me feel as I'm not good enough. No I am not going to do anything to harm myself but my mind is definitely rolling.

I take my Xanax and I put on a fake smile because I'm worried is she sees how bad I'm hurting it's going to push her. She doesn't see what she is doing and I don't know how to fix it. I am constantly running with high anxiety trying not to say the wrong thing. What's that also gets to me as is a parent I don't want her to think it's okay to treat people the way she's been treating people. But if I try to correct her she just said she's just might as well kill herself then because she's not good enough. 

Also I know someone will suggest that I need to talk to someone like a therapist myself but that can't happen right now. I am a single mom working two jobs and I'm already trying to figure out how I'm going to pay the co-pays for all her appointments on top of the hospital bills occurred. Her father is not in the picture to do any kind of help. 

Thanks in advance!

85,I’ve been on three mental health plans now and haven’t booked an appointment because I’m worried. Procrastinating? Thinking I can fix it myself? I don’t know. How do you make the leap to speaking to a professional/psychologist.,10Jun2019,2
86,"I suffer depression, with suicidal ideation. 

I can't take antidepressants, I'm in the UK so I get therapy but I only receive 12 X 1 hour sessions - once these are over I have to wait six months before I can re-refer and it's a nine month wait.

I'm on week 8/9 with my therapist and it's not helping, he's openly said he doesn't know how to help me. I am supposed to be getting CBT and I thought it'd be more active in the sense of challenging my thoughts and giving homework, but that's not happened - as always therapy has just been talking about mundane stuff, it's not helpful at all! I've always had to switch therapists once as the first one I was given kept refusing treatment and there was a personality clash, so I don't think I could ask for yet another therapist. 

Now my therapist has said he can't help I don't feel comfortable going to therapy, as now it feels all the more pointless and it feels like he's checked out so it doesn't do much for our working relationship. Why keep going if he can't help me? Why keep going if I don't feel comfortable talking to him any more and with only a few weeks which won't be used to help?

The problem is if I leave therapy I have nothing, I'll have to wait up to a year before I get opportunity to see a therapist again and go through this whole process yet again.

I don't understand how a therapist can say 'I can't help you', I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.",10Jun2019,2
87,"Okay so I’ve been actively working on myself for a little over a year now. I’ve lost some weight, opened myself up to new people more and (a really big one for me) started taking pictures. I literally before last year never took a picture voluntarily. It’s like pulling teeth, I’d be literally on the verge of an anxiety attack. I don’t even know why. 

It’s gotten better, but yesterday I let my friend go through my camera roll and when she opened pictures I took of myself, I’d feel so overwhelmingly embarrassed and shy. It’s hard for me to let others take pictures of me for this reason. 

I’ve noticed a similar thing where I don’t want to dress up too much, wear too much makeup or even look new people in the eye sometimes. 

I can’t sing or dance around people (it takes a few drinks) and it’s hard for me to say exactly what’s on my mind or even curse.

So she said to come back tomorrow and i will be put on a waiting list..

Im so confused, why a waiting list ? Thats never happened before with my old doctors. I dont think they had a dedicated ""mental health practitioner"" though.. Someone explain? I wanted an appointment not a waiting list. Can i still be prescribed ?

Now I know that someone could say oh your playing the victim or you want to see someone with a bad life let me show you. Also if you come from privilege you just have the hand up. I’m so sick of being undervalued and people holding something over you to settle the score because of your position and yours. I’m tired of being the nice guy and getting no where.

90,"By relationship I mean friendship in this matter. BUT. Last year I told my close friend that I have feelings for him, unfortunately he was into someone. He was into me in the past. Almost 2 months after I told him about my feelings, I went to gynecologist for the 1st time in my life and I was diagnosed with vaginismus. As a woman who feels that she's more like a giver in sexual matters *(I've got no experience)*, I think that this diagnose has been affecting me a lot. It's eating me from the inside. It terrifies me and paralyzes me. I have had few therapy sessions but I didn't manage to mention it at all.  


Today, I have spent time at work reading reddit ;) and I started to wonder. What if because of this bloody vaginismus I sabotaged my relationship with this guy? How can I figure out that this is what happened? Is it possible to figure that out?  
I was pushy, needy, scared of losing a friend, I acted bad many times. Few times I was even scared of myself. I have never been perfect but I don't think that I have ever acted so bad. I was also a people pleaser. Luckily, slooowly I have fixed my mistakes.",10Jun2019,1
91,"Some background: I was born in 2001, was diagnosed with ADHD when I was somewhere in between preschool-1st Grade. Was immediately thrown onto medications in order to attend school. If something didn't appear to be working, they tossed me onto another medication. I feel like I was basically used as a guinea pig for different medicines. I'd taken 10+ different mental health medications before I was even ten years old. Some of which left permanent side effects, like nervous ticks. After the mental health company that we'd been using shut down, we were moved to another place, (which couldn't keep a doctor), where they just put me on Abilify and left it at that. My grandmother(who I loved unconditionally) passed away in 2017. I could not cry at her funeral, and couldn't feel sad for her. This was devastating to me. Even from a Logical standpoint, me being unable to cry made me realize that something was wrong with me.  I forced myself to stop taking it at 17(of course this isn't advised, but I couldn't care.)

The issue:

I can't feel emotion. I can't stay happy for long periods of time, can't stay angry at something for too long either. I can't cry. I have lost what seems to be all of my attachment to family. I couldn't cry at my grandmother's funeral, or feel any pain or sadness at all. I am still unable to cry about it, no matter how much I want to, just to feel a little bit of closure. Anytime I get close to just letting myself cry, I'm pulled back before I can. I feel that it's the doctor's faults, because I couldn't do anything about it, and my parents were just trying to do the ""best"" for me by trusting the doctors. I don't know what I could do to unblock, or if it's even possible at this point.",10Jun2019,3

She felt nothing. Absolutely nothing at all. She had lost the life inside her and she felt defeated and resigned. She wasn't angry, she wasn't happy. She had nothing on her mind and yet she couldn't focus. She wasn't tired but she was exhausted. She felt numb. The world was so far away from her. She simply existed. 
Life had suspended, it had paused. What she saw, what she heard, what she smelled, wasn't in sync with how she felt. Her world inside was millions of miles away from her world outside. 
And yet she would wake up at nighttime sobbing as she hadn't sobbed since she was a small child. She cried quietly until she had a headache and her eyes were too swollen to stay open. It wasn't just a miscarriage; it was the loss of a soul that had been a part of her family. It was the loss of hope, of dreams, of an almost real future of carrying her baby in her arms.
She had never been more conscious of the blood that came out  of her. Every time she saw it, she was bitterly reminded of her loss.

109,"Hello All. I am looking for advice on something that has been on a mind for some time. I am mid-30s and I am pretty happy with my life. I have a good job, family, friends and financially stable. I would say I enjoy my life but I often think that life was better 10 years ago. It doesn't take much for something to remind me of an experience I had a while ago such as hearing a song or reading about a holiday destination I've been to. Also, my Mother died of cancer 3 years ago and she loved going sightseeing with me in London so often when I see something in London that she would have liked I have a horrible feeling of regret that I didn't take my Mother to see it when she was around. However I did have my nostalgic feelings frequently before she died so I do not think my feelings are only caused by her loss.

I expect it is common for people to remember the good times in their past but I do this a few times daily and I am worried that this is stopping me enjoying the present day as much as I should. Has anyone had any experience of this and have any tips? I would be prepared to read any books that are recommended and my employer would pay for me to have a couple of counselling sessions if that was recommended (I would be prepared to pay for further sessions if they were useful).

I go from loving my job one day to absolutely hating it within that same week. I'll pick up a project or offer to help someone with something and when I offer to help I'm really interested in the subject. By the time the task comes around I have no interest in it and actually dread helping them out with it. Also, I'll buy a book and start reading it. By the time I'm 100 pages in I have no interest in reading any more. 

I'm trying to figure out something else to do with my life (career wise) and I'll start learning a new skill and I'll go hard at it for a week or so, then I'll lose all interest in learning that skill completely.

114,"I'm constantly scared that people from my past will come forward and expose my secrets and flaws. I'm terrified that these people could come forward and ruin me if they wanted to.

The person I am the most afraid of is my emotionally and sexually abusive ex. He knew how to destroy me when he was in my life and I know he would know exactly how to destroy me now, after years of no contact, if he really wanted to. 

In my life, I've ghosted a lot of people who exploited my kindness/stalked me/crossed personal boundaries/etc. (just straight up blocked them without an explanation and never looked back), I've told many people that I didn't think we were compatible (as friends and/or romantic partners), I'm a college instructor and I've been forced to fail quite a few students... I basically feel like I'm running from a whole army of people who hate me from my past. 

This fear keeps me from living my life. I'm scared of pursuing my dreams because if, by some miracle, I got recognition for an achievement, I'm afraid that these people would show up and expose my ugly side and tell me, and everyone else, that I don't deserve happiness or peace or success. I don't even have social media because I don't want these people to see me or have a way of keeping tabs on me or contacting me. I don't want to remind them of my existence because I'm afraid that this would reignite their hatred towards me. I wish I could erase myself from all of their memories so I would be free to live my life.

Currently i have only two friends, and I'm talking to them really irregularly. About once in a few weeks. I have, again, succesfully isolated myself. And i think that fact makes my whole situation a lot harder.
- First of all, I'm pretty unhappy with my job (I'm doing an apprenticeship and I'm switching departments every half a year/year, my next ones won't really be nicer too) and I'm making a lot of mistakes, i need to ask my colleagues twice about every little thing, plus, I don't think i fit the team very much.
- I'm cringing like all the time. My only hobbies are gaming, drawing and watching Netflix (tho I'm only motivated to watch movies lately) and those don't really distract me from thinking about every little fuck up i did on my past day and what I could've done differently, even when they really weren't that bad. My brain just won't shut up, and i can only fall asleep while watching a movie or when i smoked shortly before going to bed, and even then I'll need some music.
- I love going to the movies, but i just can't really enjoy things like that anymore, though i think I've had that problem my entire life. When I'm watching a movie I'm really invested in in one second, something brings me down to earth, completely kicking me out of the zone the next one. I'm just sitting there, thinking about me sitting in an old sweaty chair beside some sweaty people I don't know. And it takes me a while getting back into it again, often it's not only once that it's happening throughout one movie.

I'm suddenly realizing I'm in charge of the vehicle, and i could literally kill myself and possibly another person too, if i only move the steering wheel a bit to the side. I don't want to, don't get me wrong, and it's no urge to do exactly that, it's just the sudden realization that fills me with anxiety.
- I'm really empathetic, and I can't even sit calmly and watch a movie with somebody if I'm not 100% sure that they have a 100% nice experience.
Also, old people, mostly men, that have some kind of problems or illnesses, just really get to me (good thing i work in a hospital, right ha, ha). Don't ask me why, I don't know either. But seeing them talking to me about their family or something, even if it's just ""Oh, my family can't come visit me today."" makes me want to cry. My dad's fine and we have an ok relationship, so I don't understand why it is how it is.
- It's really hard for me to open up to people. Either that and I'm pushing people away, or I'm getting too clingy and they want nothing to do with me anymore.


I already went to my GP a few months ago, because I wanted to start... somewhere. I explained to him what situation I'm in (well, i tried to, bc suddenly i started crying), and asked him what my options are. He told me something about meds and sleep medicine, but he also gave me a long list of therapists in my area.

117,"Hi all,

I suffer from GAD, OCD, and mild depression.

I recently came across a condition called Sensorimotor OCD, where people become overly aware of their breathing, blinking, swallowing etc. The moment I learned about it my brain was hooked. And I've now become obsessed with it.

Basically, I spend every waking moment thinking of this form of OCD. Debating whether I have it, what life will be like living with it, reading about other peoples stories, thinking about how other people don't have it etc. 

The thing is... I'm not even obsessed with my breathing, blinking or swallowing. I'm obsessed with the condition. The fear of having it, and how if I have it, it will plague the rest of my life. Whether I'm at home alone, out with friends, or at work. It's all I can think about, and I don't know why. It's becoming quite distressing now and is distracting me, causing more anxiety, and stopping me from doing things I enjoy.

I know it seems silly and irrational, but it's annoying me and hampering my quality of life at the moment. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I can go about tackling this irrational obsession and stop it from playing on my mind 24/7?

119,"Hey all. Not totally sure if this is the right place to post this, but its my best option for an unbiased opinion. Long story short, on June 20 of last year I spent 2 days in family court securing a final restraining order against my mother after years of abuse. Her impact over the years has been strong; I suffered chronically with anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts for 3-4 years. Since the restraining order has been in place, I've recovered quite a bit but I still have my moments. My current therapist was with me throughout the summer last year as the restraining order was being implemented. 

I was summoned to appear for Jury Duty tomorrow (nearly a year to the day of my court appearance last summer), and felt fine about going back to the courthouse until yesterday when anxiety and panic started to set in. I couldn't really picture myself sitting there waiting all day in the same location as a year ago without starting to panic, so this morning I called and asked what it would take to be excused this time around. They said I'd need a letter from my therapist or doctor explaining the situation. 

What follows is the correspondence I had with my therapist via text this morning. I know we're not therapists on this sub, but  I'd like to see if this is a reasonable therapist response from others with experience? I'm not sure if my feeling about it being mishandled is correct. Thanks everyone.  


**Me**: Hi *therapist name*. I'm having ridiculous anxiety over having to go to jury duty tomorrow and back to the courthouse after sitting through the whole situation in court with my mom. Is there any way you could draft me a letter so I can submit it to be excused? It doesn't have to be long. I've been panicking since yesterday.

**Therapist**: I think you can just ask for a deferral as no one will cover for you at work. As long as you note you will available at x time. You usually don't end up having to stay. Especially if you answer the questionnaires with liberal attitudes and fear about being seen by the defendant. You sit around w/ laptop or book and then they release you after 2 days. Are you really that panicked? Or do you just not wanna go - like being impatient at work right now? Because it may be good for you to get back on the horse and see that you can do this. Just checking with you.

**Me**: I asked for a deferral for work-related reasons already as they originally summoned me in April during black out days. I felt fine about it on Saturday but yesterday I was fairly panicked about it. I feel like its a little too raw as its been nearly exactly a year to the day that I was there. I spoke to the jury manager and she said I'd just need a letter to be excused.

**Therapist**: Oh ok. What should it say? Keep it short and I'll work off what you write. Very dense today - en route to CA Wednesday.  
**Therapist**: I sent you the note. Tell if me okay. Also, in the future, I would appreciate being given enough notice so that we can discuss it ahead of me writing any notes. This is a little too last minute for what I consider to be good therapeutic use of the situation. I also sometimes can't accommodate things that quickly because I've got so much going on in my own life so it was lucky I was able to take a little time this morning to just do this. No worries. Just saying...hope it helps.

123,"It's the final week of my gcses and I just needed somewhere to talk about how proud I am of myself.

I've been battling with depression, anxiety, ptsd and anorexia for years and I missed around 2&amp;a half - 3 years of school due to my mental health.

At 3 different points everyone around me was under the impression I would drop out of school or just not attend my exams at all. I did too if I'm honest.

But I stuck it out and taught myself everything I missed including the whole of macbeth and the majority of my maths and science content. I'm in my last week of gcses (3 exams left) and I've never been prouder of myself. I know my results won't be as good as they would of been (I was predicted 8s and 9s) but I've actually sat the exams and worked my fucking ass off to get here.

I need to pass everything to get into my courses at sixth form but even if I don't I will still be proud of myself because I just said fuck you to everyone who doubted me and proved I can still make something of myself.

124,"I'm very much confused about myself and my mental state and why I always seem to end up hurting those I care about the most. I think I need to see a therapist but I also don't think I can afford one. I guess I'm really just looking for insight about how messed up I am.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, I had met someone online about four days. We both instantly felt like we were each other's best friends and everything was going great and we were even considering a relationship. Everything was going great until someone close to her passed away and she told me that she needed time for herself and she didn't think we would work out. I originally told her I understood but despite the fact that I only talked to her for two days I didn't know how to let go of her. She was grieving but I texted her again telling her how much I cared about her. I've accepted how unemphatic this was of me and how weird and creepy this is but I still have so much attachment to her.  I don't want to be like this anymore. I don't know if I have attachment issues, if I'm just um-empathetic or if being abandoned by my father at a young age caused me to be so messed up. I feel really bad about how I acted and now I think I scared her away forever (which is probably for the best but I still feel like I would like to support her through her tough time) but I don't think normal people act this way and I hate myself. I start to blame myself when people leave me and I start to think maybe I can still fix things.   


I also feel unable to cry when I am sad. I can feel the worst in the world and I would love to be able to cry and let it out but instead I just feel a constant numbness. I feel like I'm constantly being blocked from experiencing normal emotions. I've considered I might be a sociopath but I went on /r/sociopath and those people disgusted me. I do have emotions for other people and I often feel it very strongly in my heart when someone else is in pain but I just don't feel like I'm quite there otherwise I don't think I would have responded to the grieving girl how I did. I have also been working on my compulsive lying which is also how my last relationship ended. I can't think of a specific mental condition I have but I don't think I'm mentally health.   


Every time I try for happiness with someone else and I think I can have a normal life I just ruin it every time. I'm starting to give up hope on finding someone I can make happy. I'm starting to think I should just spend my whole life alone.",10Jun2019,1

I just don't feel like I'm getting any benefit from it because half of the time I'm getting stressed listening to the other people or feel as though I can't really relate to anyone there while they're all relating to eachother which is kinda isolating. The other half of the time I'm frustrated that I can't just sit down, talk through the skills with the therapist and leave. It feels like the therapist-patient relationship is somewhat diluted or lacking. I miss 1 on 1 but everyone keeps telling me to stick this out.",10Jun2019,1
126,"Hello I'm Joseph and I'm 18 and looking for any kind of advice or help on something that I've been dealing with for a little while.

So for the last two years or so ive experienced what I think is Dissociation or maybe somehting else but I dont really know. It started when I was in Morocco on holiday 2 years ago, I was sitting in the back seat of the car and things started to black out like all the sky would just go dark so I thought I was dhydrated but after drinking a bunch it just got a lot worse, all at once if i kept my eyes open for a little too long everything in my vision started to breakdown and freeze, I don't remember most of it, I threw up a lot and the worse it got was when one of the car doors went from a 2d peice in my vision to a completely different 3d object like looking at a really long rectangle at such an angle that it looks like a square but all I remember was the car door rotating and transforming into this insane shape that doesn't at all resemble a car door. I was pretty spooked but I never told anyone because I thought i was just tired. Since then it's been getting worse and worse, that holiday was definetly was the worst and when I got back home it was fine and since then it's getting progressively worse.   so that's the first time i think

The symptoms that i think are part of it are as follows; INSANELY bad memory like the last 2 years could have been 2 days and unless someone reminds me of an event then it may as well have never happened, a complete loss with what reality used to feel like honestly this could be normal but everything from time to touch feels so gone and secondary i dont think i can describe it, self is gone i mean i was already learning a lot about different points of veiw but any feeling of me has just left and it feels like im playing a character.

So yeh i don't know whats happening, ive tried as much as is in my power but it just doesnt shake like everything is one big dream honestly i thought writing this would give me a bit of feeling and pull me into myself for a bit but nothing so i guess ill just post shit. sorry for rambling i never ever talk about my problems to friends sometimes ill randomly vent to a family member but its usually about a shitty teacher or whatever whatevrere.

Although there's not much at stake here so don't feel bad for moving on like ill never kill myself even though the stats for guys my age get pretty scary for the next ten years.

I want to talk about 3 more things now as im putting this all out there, who i am, what it feels like day to day, why it scares me

Why it scares me;

Any time i want to just live and be, i just cant and on m 18th birthday or out with friends, also since this has been getting progressively worse over the last two years im scared where itll go. im just so fucking scared ill get to 60 and be like great, what the fuck happened for 40 years.

What it feels like day to day;

failure to feel consequences, care about people, care about myself and my health, some waves of extreme numbness where i need to clap and kind of spasm a bit to stop myself from just drifting i can tell its coming when i cant hear too well, i dont know how much it effects me to be honest probably because of my memory but i could  be sitting on the train and get hit with how bad the feeling is but then i cant remember if it just hit or if its been like that all day and i was actually in the moment without realising but then i cant remember the fine details of the day so was i there or was i on autopilot. A few months ago i spent a month in hospital and i was kinda hoping for it to really bring me into reality since there was so much happening but it was one of the worst in terms of dissociation, i was put through wound redressings every day for a couple weeks and i spent the time trying to iscolate the pain and pin down a moment and even though i could tell it hurt i was still so far from what was happening.

who i am;

So im 18, come from what i think is a pretty priviledged upbringing although i cant gauge what my definition of that is so ive had a house, loving family, and food everyday. I live in London and go to college, i dont have a close social circle but i love all my friends and theyre all extremely different people so talk is never boring, as i said i never talk about any of my problems to them mainly because they are talking to me about theirs and i always assume my problems are gonna blow over before its worth talking to people about them, sometimes it can get kinda annoying coming in every day and asking hey how are you and i can always guess itll be ""really bad man"" and theyll come in each day with a new problem which is always the centre of everything but i just tell myself im more mature than all of them and do my best to help them because i really do love them, i always find that the people who have to deal with real shit like physical health issues and family problems are way more closed and less rude when shit goes bad. i think its good to have people like them in your life because what i deal with is nothing in comparison to a friend who has a health problem and has to go hospital a fair bit so it at least helps me get some real percpective. i always keep myself busy, i do a game design course and always have a ton of personal projects in the works, i do rock climbing regularly, have 2 part time jobs one at dominos and one at an after school club, im learning 2 languages on the side when i can and love to read, especially books about or with philosophical themes.

Im never gonna tell my parents because its my responsibilty and therapy is expensive.

129,"I was recently diagnosed with OCD when I started having intrusive thoughts and fear of having a serious physical illness or mental illness. I also had intense fear over severe weather and would constantly look up radars and watch the news a lot for weather updates. There was a tornado that was really close to me when that whole severe weather outbreak happened in the Midwest and northeast/east coast area this May. I feel like this may have sent me over the edge because it was so scary! All of these obsessions caused me to stop living life. That was about a month ago and lasted for most of May. Now I’m feeling so much better and it’s almost like it has disappeared! I still have little moments but I’m able to talk myself through them and remind myself I have no control so I might as well not worry about my obsessions. 

I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at 15 (I’m 20 now). But was doing really well until this “episode” I had recently. My psychiatrist tried to put me back on medication (we tried 2 different ones) and each one made me even more anxious and made me so sick. I’m not taking anything now and feel great and like the old me. I saw my old therapist once to talk about things with her and she gave me lots of tips to help me through this episode. 

What I was wondering though if it’s normal for OCD to come and go like this. It’s just so odd I feel so much better after thinking I never would. I was really motivated to get better so I’m wondering if this also helped? It’s just so confusing!! 

I do have many major life stresses in my life. My father has stage 4 cancer, grandmother is in the hospital with heart problems, I finished finals about a month ago (I had an anxiety attack during them), just moved to a new apartment, and that tornado I mentioned above.",10Jun2019,1
130,"Just some things one of my friends does that drives me absolutely insane. I’ve always felt it was out of condescending nature and I just don’t know how to deal with it.

1. I was telling my friends about how I went out the night before to this crazy party. I explicitly said by the end of the party I was sober, i also ubered back to another friends house (which took a significant amount of time) and then I drove home. I would NEVER drink and drive ever and my friend knows this. (Also my dad was in a car accident as the result of a drunk driver and he almost died, which she knows as well). So I continue telling my story and about 10 minutes later I’m wrapping it up with “yea I’m so happy I went home because I was so tired and needed to be in my own bed” or something along those lines. To which she, with the most judgmental look on her face, said “you drove drunk!!???”. I almost lost it because 10 minutes earlier we had an engaged convo where I specifically said I was completely sober driving home. It just felt really condescending.

2. She conveniently “forgets things”. I’m pretty sure it’s just her being too embarrassed to admit she made a mistake. She goes to college back east (we live in the Midwest). I left my textbook at someone’s house, and the friend I’m talking about now put it in her car. (Which was nice, but the person who’s house I left it at lived way closer to me than she does but whatever, no big deal). She lets me know that she took my text book and she had it, etc. etc. no big deal again. Until she leaves for uni. again (we were on break when this happened). I assumed that she would have given the text book to her brother to give me since he still lives here, but she took it 5 states over with her. When I asked her about it she said “oh sorry I didn’t even know I had your textbook. Like what??? I even said “you’re the one that told me you had it originally” and the reply I get is “oh sorry I don’t remember :(“

137,"Just last week I've been out with my friends, and after few beers we called it a night and one of them was walking me home and accidentally started talking about very triggering thing for me (she didn't know so I don't blame her), normally I wouldn't react that badly, but being kinda drunk and on meds my brain just switched red and it put me into really bad panic attack. She handled me very well and spent another hours with me just to make sure I feel well enough to be left alone, but I still feel so bad that I wasted so much of her time on dealing with my shit. 

Since then we're still talking but haven't touched this subject, yet I'm feeling like she's kinda distancing herself or maybe that's just my thoughts. 

And I'm so angry because I don't want anyone to define me by my mental issues and treat me extra protectional because of that. And that left me wonder what's the other's side viewpoint on that, did your close one's mental struggles changed your view of them?",10Jun2019,2
139,"&amp;#x200B;

Hello, I just wanted to list a few of the things that are bothering me, in case anyone has any advice.

&amp;#x200B;

* I am struggling with general social anxiety.
* I am struggling with low self esteem, and I feel worthless.
* I can't stop telling myself to just go and die.
* I am starting to have trouble eating because of the negative way I feel about my body.
* I feel like I am ugly and I feel like other kids and adults are constantly judging me. I always overthink everything and people give me dirty looks, making me even more feel hideous. I try not to think about this, by completely avoiding the mirror like the plague, or anything that will show my reflection whatsoever, but I just can't stop worrying excessively about what other people think of me. I don't want to live like this anymore: everyone else seems so happy and is having the time of their lives, while I am here hiding and eating my lunch in the bathroom because I am too self conscious and insecure.
* I feel extremely lonely, and so I cope with all of these things by daydreaming excessively to the point where I lose focus and start to procrastinate on important things because I am too caught up in another world which doesn't even exist. I spend about half my day doing nothing but this. I tend to imagine my ideal life and self and it lowers my self-esteem and hope when I think about the idea that some of those things are so unrealistic and the possibility that I will never achieve those goals because I have set my standards ridiculously high. I see and talk to people as if they are in front of me, even though, in reality, there is nobody there. I created a bunch of imaginary friends to help me cope: I know every detail about them - their personalities, morals, their backgrounds, and everything. I even drew them. They make me laugh and feel like life is worth living. I know I couldn't live without them. I don't want to focus on reality. But I realize how my daydreaming is starting to get unhealthy and out of hand, (i can't even get enough sleep because of it), and I feel like I should get help, but I just don't know what to do, and I am too scared to ask for help because I feel like if I do, people will think I'm mad. 😔
* I am my biggest insecurity and I constantly feel as though I am not good enough. What scares me is whether I will ever be good enough, for myself, and for those around me.
* I am constantly afraid of embarrassment and embarrassing myself, and always feel embarrassed of myself.
* On top of all this, there is the constant stress of school, including the pressure of getting perfect grades, otherwise, I fear I will feel like and be seen as a pathetic, useless failure.
* And despite all of this, I still keep asking myself ""What is wrong with me?"", when there are obviously several things wrong with me - I just don't know how to fix them, and I continually worry whether I will ever be up to the mark.

&amp;#x200B;

I need help because I don't know what to do or where to start. Things just seem to be getting worse. I am lost and I really need some guidance, if anyone knows how to deal with any of the things I have mentioned, please help.

Thank you for reading this,

Have a great day :)",10Jun2019,2
140,"I'm looking for some online or mobile resources for mental healthcare. Maybe just someone you could text with to talk about things? Not something like a suicide hotline with generic, scripted-sounding answers. Does anyone know of anything like that?",10Jun2019,1
141,"I am worried/concerned about my mental health, and I think I have about 3 or 4 possible mental health disorders. I feel like I should seek professional help or even some medication for fear things might get worse, but I'm too scared and too young to seek that kind of help by myself, even though I want to keep it a secret.

142,"I’m in my late teens and have had problems with my mental well-being for a few quite a few years now. At one point I was receiving help through the health service where I’m from which I personally felt to be complete shit. I packed it in but didn’t go long enough to find anything out. Ever since then things have steadily gotten worse. My emotions are a rollercoaster that don’t just go up and down but beyond that. I’ve had problems with food but now it’s getting more difficult to control and more embarrassing. I have never thought of totally giving up but those thoughts grow and grow each day. It’s hard for me to go back to get support because, and I don’t know why, I just sugarcoat everything. Maybe it’s fear of actually knowing I’m not okay idk. I’ve taken loads of those online tests and every one tells me I have BPD and anxiety which idk how reliable those are, probably not at all. I live with my mother and she’s just the cherry on the cake. It’s like she doesn’t believe me or care really at all. Even today she’s make me feel guilty about my emotions (not a good day today) basically telling me I don’t deserve to feel shit and that I have all this stuff and people and blah blah blah.  She doesn’t understand at all. There are large pieces missing but I just had to get even a bit of it off my chest.

143,"I feel like I have nothing left in life anymore. I thought things were going in the right direction. I got a decent paying first job, I got myself into a long-distance relationship, and I was on track for finding a therapist. What I got instead was a job that is killing me and won't let me leave, less than 20 hours of sleep in the past WEEK (no sleep between Wednesday and Saturday as I'm writing this), crippling loneliness, and a week of failed scheduling for a therapist (live in the US). I feel nothing but numbness. I'm having a hard time trying to move because I just don't have any motivation. I wanted to get help and called three different places that offered therapy. One didn't take my insurance, another never got back to me, and the final one I tried keeps putting me on hold only to be routed to an answering machine. They were open and I was on the line with a human but they routed me to the therapy department or whatever they have and that's where everything ends.

144,"Hi. I'm new here so I'm sorry if I break any rules. I'm a 21 year old student suffering from ADHD and Generalized Anxiety with goals of being an actor/director/writer and I recently have started a journey through self actualization and something that I consider a spiritual Awakening. This past new year's, due to an unhealthy abusive/addictive self medicating relationship with marijuana, I decided that I was going to live a sober life from there on.  I vowed to give up weed and alcohol. This was thanks to a recontextualized understanding of addiction and substance dependency from reading Russell Brand's book on addiction. Things from there started to get better. I started practicing meditation, prayer, and yoga and I sought help from a therapist (being seeing him consistently since then) I even found myself recalling my dreams a lot more (something I really missed while being a stoner). I also rediscovered things that made me happy (acting, writing, people, nature, etc.). However, this surge of good eventually turned south. My friends (including my roommates) eventually became hostile towards my new beliefs and ideologies and virtually outcasted me. I began spending a lot more time in my room and rarely interact with them anymore. I also experienced a rather aggressive and upsetting fallout with one member in particular about a girl that he had history with that I had recently sought out as a friend. Since then I have been experiencing intense feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and suppressed rage. Needless to say, I've been extremely unhappy. Cut to the present; I am preparing for a scene for my acting class in which my character is supposed to burst into tears at the end. This is scary and challenging because I haven't truly cried since highschool. I've been trying all week to try and bring up past traumas, regrets, and sad memories but nothing has worked. So I begin to search the internet for answers. It leads me to a page outlining Melancholic Depression. (TLDR it's essentially a complete emotional block and an inability to feel any seratonin releasing emotion) leaving patients emotionless and unable to express it) I immediately identified with the symptoms and I  plan to bring it up at my next therapy session tomorrow. I really want to break through this and unblock those emotions both for myself but also for my acting practice. However, I am curious if anyone else struggles with this and if anyone else has advice. If you are also an actor and have any advice as to calling on emotion and practicing emotional expression I would really appreciate your help. All comments are welcome.

145,"I overdosed a year ago today as a suicide attempt, and honestly I’m upset I’m still here.

Today has been a fuck of a day filled with so many emotions. I just want to start crying and never stop.  Everything got so much worse this year, if I didn’t think me dying would kill my mom who’s suffering from lung and brain cancer, I would just do it already.

I can’t live with my mood swings anymore. I hate being so low then being happy and high. I can’t stand how I’m fine one second and snap the second. I hate being this stuck in my head. I hate that my eating disorder is ruling my life. I hate that I can’t just ducking sleep like a normal person. I hate that no one ever takes me seriously.

146,"This year has given me the best experiences of my life and now the worst, for many years I considered suicide, many times, just as a way to stop everything, my abusive stepfather, my feelings, all of it, I attempted it during those years.

I really can't, I think of killing myself every time of the day, I just go out to walk so I don't stay at home and freak the fuck out, self harm came back as well and I have no more strengths left, I just need some advice on what to do at this point, my psychiatry appointment is in only a few weeks and I doubt i can make it, it have never been so bad. I just want it all to end",10Jun2019,1
147,"I originally posted this in r/askdocs , but I got recommended to post here also. So this is a copy-paste of my other post. 

To start off I’m a 15 Male 5’11 and weigh 161lbs. I’m Caucasian and the duration is 3-4 weeks. The location is the head/brain. I was diagnosed with ADHD and depression with medication (Adderall, Strattera) 3-4 years ago in my middle school years (6th and 7th specifically) but since the middle of my 7th-grade year stopped taking it for my health then has increased and I have felt much better. Don’t know if this matters but I do smoke marijuana and quit vaping ( around 4 weeks ago) due to paranoia around my problem thinking that it was the cause. 

Just a couple side notes, I don’t know who to go to really. I’m afraid to talk about that with my parents. My dad is sort the no bullshit/very busy kind of guy. So I can’t really talk about this in full because he’s so busy. When I tried telling him how I feel he just says to stop panicking and that’s it. My mom is usually out of my state a lot for her job so I usually don’t see her much. This issue has been freaking me out ever since it starting happening and I’m on the verge of sobbing every time it happens. So any type of help will be very appreciated, I just want to be normal again. 

To make sure every detail is in I’m going be to saying a lot of stories involving what happens, I will try to make a small conclusion on the bottom with (almost) everything stated. Again I’m 15 so bear with me through grammar and the stuff that I do. Thank you. 

So it all started when I was in the last week of school. You know finals and stuff, so I was stressing out a lot. I am getting enough sleep, I usually go to bed at 11-12 ish and wake up at 8 for school. I usually feel very fine, I can remember things, I can actually think, being active and all that. Then for 3 days straight. I’ve been having sleep paralysis. I’m just stuck there until my body wakes up. I thought because of all the stress during finals, I was experiencing that. I was also very lost. Meaning that my mind was very fuzzy. I couldn’t remember things from 20 minutes ago. An example I was getting a snack and I put a bowl out on the table and next thing I know I’m at the gym with a friend. Completely oblivious that I was getting a snack, I left everything there and forgot about it. All in the span of around 20 minutes. Then when school and finals ended I was back to normal. I felt great. Even before the last week happened, during school, I felt so normal. 

Then weird things with me started happening. I would be minding my business feeling fine and all of that. Then all of a sudden my heart starts racing and I feel different. I don’t feel like myself. I start to think about what’s wrong with me. Then I get completely freaked out and try to look up diseases corresponding. With my issue. Which of course, doesn’t help and makes me want to cry.

The symptoms going on are that: 
-I can’t think clearly 
-I can focus on one thing but then change to another subject
-my voice or Consciousness in my head thinks what’s wrong with me 
- I can’t stop thinking about the attacks and it leads to me trying to figure out what it is 
-more than I can’t think of at the moment 
———————————————————
It’s been getting so bad that I get paranoid about what they are. I kept hearing bad things on how vaping causes brain damage and other things that I’ve quit the thing fully. Just recently about 4 days ago I smoked marijuana out of a soda can because I didn’t have a pipe. When I had another one of these “attacks” I then think that when I smoked it, I inhaled things from the can that have burned.  Hell, I’m even thinking that it’s because I’m not washing my bed often, and the bugs that bite me are messing with my head. I even thought that because My hair is growing longer, the heat is causing me to think differently. That’s how paranoid I’ve become. When my friends tell me to not think about it, that’s the complete opposite, like when I’m fine, I think that “if I’m fine now, what caused that last “attack” then?”   And “I’m fine now, when’s the next episode going to come?”  

Another thing is, you know how you can see what’s going on around you in your head? Like for example, I’m home alone and my parents are at dinner currently. Like it’s a no brainer, right? For me, I have to keep constantly think about that, because I’m afraid I’m going to forget. 

It’s been bad enough that I’m thinking that I have: Dementia, schizophrenia, brain damage and more. 

That is all I can think of to say for my issue. I have come up with some conclusions that may help me a bit. That actually makes sense 

1. That I’ve been having sleep deprivation, and because I usually stay up till 12-1 and wake up early at 7, that I’m not getting enough sleep, and that it’s messing with my thinking process. (Probably a useless detail, but I usually take my showers at night, they usually last around 1 hour to an hour and a half. Maybe because I’ve been in hot water for that long that it causes me to be more awake, idk) 

2. That I may be having another growth spurt. Another probably useless detail is that I started puberty in between 4-5th grade. It’s been years since I’ve stopped, maybe it’s happening again and the chemicals in my brain are freaking out again. 

3. That my ADHD might be relapsing and that I need to go on ADHD medication again. 

4. That I’m over thinking all this shit and stressing myself out because of it. 
———————————————————

So if anyone in this subreddit can help me figure this out, it’ll help me so much. I just want to be a normal-thinking teenager again. I’m getting really scared to the point that I’m crying just typing this sentence. So please, if you can, help me... I’ll try my best to answer any questions 

TLDR: I haven’t been normal and  I’ve been having episodes of pure fear that involve not thinking correctly, racing heartbeat and others because I keep thinking the worse about my mental health. 

PS: Sorry mods if I missed anything, I tried reading the rules and put everything that I know in this post.",10Jun2019,1
148,"I'm 30 years old and lost ten years of my life to untreated mental health condition.  Was diagnosed with something when I was 16, but forgot all about it. I've also been a raging alcoholic since I was 15, quit at 20 because I almost died, then started again on and off 2016 to 2018.  Sober over a year again. 

I've had four complete mental breakdowns (psychosis, I believe) over these past 10-12 years, maybe longer, I don't know.  I am trying so hard to find a psychiatrist that accepts Medicaid but it seems impossible.  The last episode I had was terrifying. I literally thought it was the end of the world.  A family member talked me through it and I'm feeling a lot better, but still keep thinking I'm being watched, recorded, everything is a test from God. I'm worried. 

My head feels like it's physically ""full."" I am constantly sweaty, have terrible insomnia and sometimes can't eat for days.  I really can't go on much longer like this (not suicidal anymore, just feel like I'm going to explode or disappear). 

At what point do I admit myself into a hospital?  I'm terrified if I try to do that, they're going to push me away.  Right now I seem relatively normal if you talk to me but my mind is racing and I'm all over the place.

Every relationship I have is turning into shit. I don't know where to run away.

I am a 25(m). I am having problems in every relationship of my life and it is frankly suffocating me to death.

Father - My father is very concerned about my future. He wants me to get settled in life as soon as possible. He makes sure that I know about his concern by reminding me about it every day. He always says that had I listened to him earlier, I wouldn't be in such a bad place. He scrutinizes my every single action, be it from past or present.  Recently I was diagnosed with B12 deficiency, according to him it happened because I used to skip breakfast 2 years ago while going to college.

I put on some weight recently, it happened because I didn't join a gym 3 years back during sem break as he suggested. I would have paid attention to my fitness after that and wouldn't have grown over weight today.

At times I really wish I would have listened to his advice but pointing each and everything out in hindsight and blaming me for it is so excruciatingly painfull.


Mother - I love my Mom from all of my heart but she has turned into this lady which has restricted herself to giving me food only.  She doesn't empathize one bit and says thing unintentionally which infuriate me to my core. She said that my younger sister (cousin) has a right to speak over me and I should just listen because that's what I was supposed to do to maintain family relations.

I have stopped talking to her as I don't want to say things in anger which I would regret later.



Cousin sister - We live in the same city as my uncle, aunt and cousins. She is 10 years younger than me. I have done nothing but love her. She was struggling with bullying at school and I provided as much emotional and mental support I can. I thoroughly enjoyed her company. We used to talk daily, but now she has become so self centred and narcissistic. I understand that she is a teenager and she is still immature at times. But I am sick of her tantrums. She recently messaged me to not to talk to her as we end up fighting always. I just asked why now and what is the reason. She started acting as if I was creeping her out. she said "" I have to understand "", "" it's her humble request "". I never once argued against not talking to her..I just asked why now. She started being so disrespectful that I can't describe. She was behaving like a typical "" Mean girl "". I don't understand where did she find the courage to behave like this.

I used to love living at my parents place. But these things are choking me out internally. I am constantly fighting with someone or other.

I have my own place in a different city. The living conditions are not that good. I have a female friend who I love more than anything for last 10 years but it is unrequited.

Female friend - I am so in love with a girl who I have known for 10 years. It is a one sided affair and recently I have realised that I am being used. One day she says that she has affection for me and believes that our friendship can survive anything. She ignores me for the next 7-8 days. She calls when none of her usual friends are around to hang out with. I feel so despicable..I am being used as a mop and I don't have the strength to ignore her. She lives nearby my own place.

That's why I had to run away to my parents place. I never would have thought that I would feel so suffocated here as well. 

I can't take it anymore. I can't handle this.
Reason I have can't change my own place is I am preparing for one of the toughest exams of the country and I can't do it while being on the job. They city I currently live in is the hub of it and has plethora of resources.My female friend also stays there for the same reason. It has made it a living hell for me.

I was planning to move back to my parents place but it is equally bad now.

I have no place to call home. I haven't smiled in a while, forget about being happy.

I have absolutely no choice of my own..I don't want to live like this anymore..I can't live like this anymore..I just want to be at peace.. for a moment.


TL:DR - I am struggling to maintain every relationship and I have no place to go. I have no place to call it a home",10Jun2019,1

155,"This is a relatively recent problem in my life. I'm a college student who's in the work force in customer service. I'm not the type of person who lash out at anybody, and any anger I feel I've learned to bottle up and try to forget about it. After all, if I were to even sort of lash out at customers, I'd be fired on the spot. In some way, I guess violent video games have served as a venting mechanism, but nothing beyond that. Though what has been happening lately has been concerning me. At first , small things would get on my nerves. Faintly hearing a conversation in another room while I'm trying to sleep. The dog barking while I'm playing video games. Stuff like that. But now things like someone's tone of voice, the slightest way someone would end a conversation, a roll of the eyes, and any sense that someone might be being rude when they're probably not, all of it would chip away at me and put me in a really bad mood. Though I've never really showed myself that way recently, I'd get headaches just from how stressed I am. I could have every reason to be in a good mood, but unable to relax for the slightest of reasons. At one point, I remember driving to work and by the time I pulled into the driveway, I felt like I want punch something. Nothing was on my mind. I was just angry for absolutely no reason.

156,"Hi everyone, 

Hoping to find a bit of help here, I'm torn on what to do. 

The gist of the story here is that I was previously working for the same employer in a management role for 10 years, and was very good at what I did. I loved my job and the atmosphere but it was becoming very stressful with more and more work but no support, and I knew I wasn't going to make any more money or grow within the company so I had some money saved, resigned and took a two months off before looking for a new job.

 I've always been a pretty happy person and never really let a lot of stuff bother me, but there was a lot of pressure on me from so many sides and I didn't recognize the signs of burnout. The new job I started was not managerial, it was just an administrative position which was fine for me as I thought it would be less stress. I was fine for a few months but about 5 months in, I started to get really sick, and I had terrible anxiety, hormone issues etc. I was diagnosed by my doctor with stage 3 adrenal failure and my body stopped/slowed producing dopamine and serotonin. I didn't know what was happening and thought it was just in my head and my performance at work was starting to dip. I lost my short term memory and had no ability to handle stress.  Once I got the diagnosis from my doctor, he suggested that I take medical leave from that job to recover. I took his suggestion and resigned. 

It's been 4 months and I am finally recovered enough that it is time to start working again. 

Here is where I'm torn.  I went for an interview and one of my references referred to my work that I left for mental health reasons. It was not on my resume as I was there for only a short time, and leaving for mental health reasons isn't something I want new potential employers to know about for fear of discrimination.   I did tell them I was at that job briefly in the interview but I'd also been doing some consulting stuff on the side so there were no questions past that. I got a call last week from the potential employer last week asking if they could speak to my old boss from that job because ""they had some concerns"" about it. I did leave on good terms with them, but I was just sick. My performance there was not a reflection on my work ethic, in fact, it's my work ethic that caused the burnout in the first place. I spoke to them about the situation and why I left, but I'm worried that I won't get the job now because of this.

 If I don't get the job and need to move forward, that's fine, but I'm torn about putting it on my resume and having to explain, or being immediately cut from the interview process because an employer may think the same thing will happen with them. I've never had a mental health issue before but I recognize the signs and symptoms now, and have worked really hard on ways to manage stress and keep my mind and body healthy. 

Any advice would be appreciated.",10Jun2019,1
157,So I’ve had a great boyfriend for two years.

159,"Hey all, 

My fiance has been pretty depressed for the last four months. She's on antidepressants that level out her moods, but she's recently spun downwards and she's been contemplating suicide and coming to me for help.

She's decided to admit herself to the hospital, but I have a few questions. We live in Saskatchewan, Canada, if that helps.

1. We have universal health care, but I don't know if that covers voluntary hospital stays? I doubt it would, and money is a huge contributor to stress in her life and mine. So going in and coming out to a huge bill won't help her at all, I think.

2. Do hospitals here even allow voluntary check ins? I don't want her to think this is a good step towards getting things figured out, then having her turned away at the door. 

3. If they do allow them, how do you go about starting the process of admitting yourself?

I know that this is going to be one of the more stressful things she has to do for herself, and she's going to be worried about the kids and I, so I want to help make this as painless as possible. Please let me know if any of you know the answers to these questions. 

Thanks a ton ❤️",10Jun2019,1

Every relationship I have is turning into shit. I don't know where to run away.

I am a 25(m). I am having problems in every relationship of my life and it is frankly suffocating me to death.

Father - My father is very concerned about my future. He wants me to get settled in life as soon as possible. He makes sure that I know about his concern by reminding me about it every day. He always says that had I listened to him earlier, I wouldn't be in such a bad place. He scrutinizes my every single action, be it from past or present.  Recently I was diagnosed with B12 deficiency, according to him it happened because I used to skip breakfast 2 years ago while going to college.

I put on some weight recently, it happened because I didn't join a gym 3 years back during sem break as he suggested. I would have paid attention to my fitness after that and wouldn't have grown over weight today.

At times I really wish I would have listened to his advice but pointing each and everything out in hindsight and blaming me for it is so excruciatingly painfull.


Mother - I love my Mom from all of my heart but she has turned into this lady which has restricted herself to giving me food only.  She doesn't empathize one bit and says thing unintentionally which infuriate me to my core. She said that my younger sister (cousin) has a right to speak over me and I should just listen because that's what I was supposed to do to maintain family relations.

I have stopped talking to her as I don't want to say things in anger which I would regret later.



Cousin sister - We live in the same city as my uncle, aunt and cousins. She is 10 years younger than me. I have done nothing but love her. She was struggling with bullying at school and I provided as much emotional and mental support I can. I thoroughly enjoyed her company. We used to talk daily, but now she has become so self centred and narcissistic. I understand that she is a teenager and she is still immature at times. But I am sick of her tantrums. She recently messaged me to not to talk to her as we end up fighting always. I just asked why now and what is the reason. She started acting as if I was creeping her out. she said "" I have to understand "", "" it's her humble request "". I never once argued against not talking to her..I just asked why now. She started being so disrespectful that I can't describe. She was behaving like a typical "" Mean girl "". I don't understand where did she find the courage to behave like this.

I used to love living at my parents place. But these things are choking me out internally. I am constantly fighting with someone or other.

I have my own place in a different city. The living conditions are not that good. I have a female friend who I love more than anything for last 10 years but it is unrequited.

Female friend - I am so in love with a girl who I have known for 10 years. It is a one sided affair and recently I have realised that I am being used. One day she says that she has affection for me and believes that our friendship can survive anything. She ignores me for the next 7-8 days. She calls when none of her usual friends are around to hang out with. I feel so despicable..I am being used as a mop and I don't have the strength to ignore her. She lives nearby my own place.

That's why I had to run away to my parents place. I never would have thought that I would feel so suffocated here as well. 

I can't take it anymore. I can't handle this.
Reason I have can't change my own place is I am preparing for one of the toughest exams of the country and I can't do it while being on the job. They city I currently live in is the hub of it and has plethora of resources.My female friend also stays there for the same reason. It has made it a living hell for me.

I was planning to move back to my parents place but it is equally bad now.

I have no place to call home. I haven't smiled in a while, forget about being happy.

I have absolutely no choice of my own..I don't want to live like this anymore..I can't live like this anymore..I just want to be at peace.. for a moment.

I am always in a constant state of anxiety..there is always a heaviness in my chest..I can't explain it I just want to drill around it and relieve the pressure. It hurts so much..


TL:DR - I am struggling to maintain every relationship and I have no place to go. I have no place to call it a home",10Jun2019,1
161,"My SO has never been the anxious type always carefree and never concerned about much. Until three months ago where he was going to class and found anonymous semen on the door handle of his classroom. He went down a rabbit hole researching HIV and after taking all the tests he could, they all came back negative. His main anxiety and paranoia comes from the idea of dying from a deadly illness. 

Anytime he’s around blood or any mysterious liquid substance he becomes fixated on it. Some days are better than others but when he’s stressed out he feels like he doesn’t have any control of overthinking all these scenarios out and working himself into a paranoid mess. 

Talking it out with him hasn’t really helped because he realizes there is no logic behind his paranoia. He ends up becoming more frustrated with himself and gets really sad. 

I’m hoping he can find a therapist soon but in the mean time any tips for me or for him I could pass on?",10Jun2019,1
162,"I feel like I'm not confident enough to think certain thoughts, and the thoughts I do think come from not being confident. Like, I don't have an opinion on whether this food is good or not because I'm not confident enough to form an opinion. Or, since currently I couldn't see myself ever being in a romantic relationship (even though I've been in one) I can't even try to imagine it. It bothers me because I used to be able to at least imagine, like I could have a fake conversation in my head or dream about being a social butterfly. Now I feel like I don't even think those thoughts because it's almost like I'm not good enough for them, it's completely impossible for me. If it's true it's a subconscious thing and I'm not exactly sure my reasoning is correct.

For example, one night failing at a job, school, triphobia, death of a loved one, etc. During the day I'm waiting for something to go wrong in my life, I'm not sure if that has anything to do with it. But it seems like my mental health/sleep was better when I had nothing going for me. Any advice?",10Jun2019,3
164,"I'm a 30 year old male living in Central Europe.

Over the past 5-6 years, I have noticed a gradual, but very steady and unwavering shift in how I perceive the world, both internal and external. I used to be a particularly active, curious, ambitious person who genuinely enjoyed things and always found things to do. I was never bored and life was mostly interesting. I listened to music and I always had films that I wanted to watch. I deeply enjoyed music and I would actively listen to songs for hours and do nothing else, it was great. When spring came, I would feel happy just because the weather was nice. I would walk in nature and enjoy the beauty of the atmosphere. I enjoyed taking photos, I took it seriously.

None of this is true anymore. I am constantly bored. I don't want to do anything, I don't want to immerse myself in anything that requires attention, it feels like a chore. I just browse low quality, shallow, uninteresting crap on the internet that I don't even enjoy, because it's low effort and keeps me mildly entertained with minimal involvement. It passes the time until the day finally ends. Music does nothing for me. Films are a chore to watch, a waste of 2.5 hours of my life. I'm not motivated to do much. I may force myself to do the things I used to like, but I will easily snap out of them and just put them down, as I cannot get immersed. I cannot bring myself to take a single photo, all artistic motivations are completely gone from me. When the weather is nice, when I take a walk in the forest, or when I'm with people I'm supposed to love, I feel nothing, at all, whatsoever. There's nothing there anymore.

It's not even true that I can't feel emotions. I often feel sad, angry, worried, stressed, and sometimes I feel somewhat happy, though not to a great extent. I mostly feel neutral. It's something else that's missing, and I just lack the vocabulary to describe it. People I've talked to do not understand. They can't even imagine what I'm talking about and quickly dismiss it as no big deal. But really, this is the worst thing that has ever happened to me. It's like being a ghost. I don't know how it's possible to live like this.

There is nothing inside me. I am like a machine: I can reason, think, act, see and hear, but I cannot *feel*. I am not in pain, and I'm not suffering. I don't feel sad, I have no particular reason to want to kill myself. It's just limbo, it goes on forever, like I'm in a black room forever, and everything that happens to me are just images on a screen, they provoke no emotional response because they're so tiny and distant, and not related to me.

I can hardly remember my previous life. I sometimes meet people who I used to be friends with, and it feels like I don't know them. I see old photos of me doing something and it feels like it was 1000 years ago.

And despite all this I seem normal to everyone. People don't notice anything about me. It's just insane. Something is terribly wrong. What the hell is going on?",10Jun2019,2
165,"Lately I have observed a huge decline in my mental health status.  
The current situation at least for me is critical. Im currently finishing my second semester  
at the university but there is no way that im going to pass to the next year.  
I have already seen the seriousness of my situation few months ago. I went to the psychologist and he have  
send me to the psychiatrist and he after giving me some drugs told me to seek psychotherapist. In spite knowing  
that the drugs only wont help me I have never went to the final therapist.   


I'm a bit different in comparison to the rest of my classmates. I have a lot of risk factors and Im very vulnerable.  
I have devoted my life to science. From the beginning I was interested in technology. Over the years i have learned  
not only the theory but the practical side of nearly all technical and scientific things.  I have helped a decent amount of people in those fields. Now I not only know a decent amount about that but i think about life in the purely scientific way.  
Few year ago I still have believed in god. Not anymore. I completely rejected that. When I finally realized that my mental health is declining i also contacted my friends and family. Unfortunately that yelled nothing. I feel like i was constantly used. There always was somebody better than me in something. My parents always told me that i could improve more.  
I tried numerous times to improve, to no effect. I was constantly angry at myself for not being perfect and failing at things. Over the time I started hating myself for my increasing laziness and computer addiction. I have realized that those could have been just symptoms of my depression and not the cause. I have lost all hope. I know that nobody from my friends and family and maybe even therapists can help me. Everything depends on me... Even getting out of that situation. Years of deterioration, people think that i can not only keep with that but deal with it easily...   
I sometimes wish that i have never pursued that scientific way. As they say: Smart, wise people are depressed. And this is  true. People that have faith in god at least have hope. The universe for me is cruel, inevitable and predictable. Everything governed by laws and equations... I thought that I had purpose in that world, to make that world better for everybody no matter what. Help people with science, simplify that. Give people power that they deserve. But without motivation to even make myself food everyday i cant even imagine me doing that.  


Now even when i have given up on everything I still write that because I still have a human bit in me I'm not a complete machine yet. Still that small spark of hope that i can get out of that hole and start living the life that i want.  


Me failing the university is inevitable. I fear that i will never get up from that. Even knowing that the university is useless for me. I really have learned everything before...",10Jun2019,1
166,"Hey

A very close friend of mine has been involuntarily hospitalized. She couldn't tell me much before they took her away but from what I understand she had called a suicide hotline or similar and someone visited her and she told them that she feels suicidal and they decided to have her hospitalized against her will for two weeks. She had been struggling for a while but I don't think it's quite what she wanted to happen. 

I'm worried sick about her and I fear that the hospitalization will make things worse for her. It would be great if someone could give me some advice and answer some questions for me maybe if they have experience with it. 

It's in the US in Arizona. 

She doesn't have health insurance so I assume they'll charge her when she gets out. How much can be expected? Is there a way to lessen the amount somehow? She's pretty much broke and I could only help her so much. 

She told me she had been quarantined. They took away her phone and everything. Is that common or normal? 

I heard a lot of horror stories about psych wards etc. How bad is it really? Will she be with people or in solitary confinement? Will she get medication? 

Thank you to everybody responding. I'm so worried about her just getting worse being isolated and then the bills afterwards. I also welcome PM's if someone maybe doesn't want to make their experiences public.

168,"I’m normally quite a reserved, quiet person. I tend to wait for my queue to talk or talk when spoken to rather than talking over people. I have a lot to say, I just don’t like interrupting other people the same way I don’t like being interrupted. 

But I’ve started to notice recently that in social situations I’m tending to just say nothing. It’s like my queue comes up, there’s a space for me to jump into, and my mind blanks and before I know it the space is gone. 

I’ve noticed almost a pattern, where I get into a social situation (and this is with friends, not new people or strangers) and it’s like there’s too much I want to say and I get flustered so I can’t think of the right thing before someone else jumps in. And then the conversation continues and I don’t know what to say, because I can’t relate or I don’t understand or because it’s not a conversation I rehearsed in my head, so I say nothing. And then because I’ve said nothing and said nothing, I just accept having nothing to say and give up entirely. Resigned to being the quiet one in the corner listening intently to what everyone else has to say. 

Now that I’ve noticed the pattern, I think back to other times over the last couple of years when I’ve felt the need to talk to people and had the same thing happen. Ending the day knowing you’ve had the opportunity to talk to people but instead decided to stay quiet, sulking because nobody had noticed how quiet I’ve been. 

I don’t know whether it’s because of the people I’m with, or because there’s something not right in my head. I know it feels worse when I’ve had a bad week at work (which seems to happen a lot), I don’t know if that’s because I’m depressed or because it’s all my brain can register. 

Like this weekend, I planned to meet some friends, and so when they all arrived at my house I had so much to say that I couldn’t pick out the right thing before somebody else jumped on the silence, and then there was nothing for me to add to the conversation other people were having, and then when they were saying goodbye I’d already sank into giving up on speaking and I barely had the energy to say goodbye, never mind the usual nice things like goodbye hugs or thanking them for coming. And it just felt horrible to watch them go feeling worse when they’d left than before they’d arrived. 

If you got this far through, thanks for reading. I guess I’m just looking to see if this is something other people recognise or experience, whether there maybe is something I could be doing to provide myself with a solution. I really don’t know what to do to help myself.",10Jun2019,3

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to create a safe, peaceful world for myself. I have not been doing this very well so far and I am now 24 years old. 

A lot of great things are happening: I am now in a band, we played a headline gig at a major venue here in my town recently. I just applied to my university for fall semester. I want to major in Computer Science and then get my Masters at UC Berkeley or MIT or something. I could see myself thriving in those places, my brother goes to Berklee school of music and my sister goes to Stanford. 

&amp;#x200B;

The bad parts: I have not developed any healthy ways of dealing with my mental health and i just freak the fuck out and end up scaring everone away and being super unattractive and people think im a weirdo in my head or something. I pretty much smoke way too much marijuana and I take kratom every day. Last year I was snorting subutex half of the time so there you go ive been opioid dependant for a year straight now. I had to buy a beer because I have the shakes. Being in the band is so fun and rewarding and a lifelong dream come true, and it feels so good to complete goals, but damn.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried working in a restaurant but after repeated verbal abuse from a coworker in a rough personal situation worse than mine i just screamed at him and he just asked me to go home. It was embarrassing. I never want to take it out on other people.

&amp;#x200B;

I will be fine I just spend way too much time alone freaking out and stressed out most of the day. No pleasure. Porn is weird. Masturbating makes me feel like a weirdo. I want to be able to keep a relationship. I am so fucking lonely. I am not an incel or a virg or desperate for a girlfriend but no sex and no opportunity for sex for two years is hard on my psyche. I even became a mormon for a year because I had no hope at all and I was just needing to integrate myself into something, anything at all. It made my life way worse do not do this.

&amp;#x200B;

My ex girlfriend was an emotional terrorist to me and threatened to kill herself all the time. I tried to be there for here until she pulled a knife on me and went batshit guano insane and threw glasses and then our little sweet kitten. hard. She would hit our cat too. All I wanted was a chill love life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Goddamn, I do not understand anything about life and I need to chill out so I do not become a nasty person.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I am having a hard time with a lot of stuff. I need to go back to university and enjoy my life while I am 24 so I do not have any more regret. I also need to learn how to calm down and be good by myself because finding a therapist is a really tough thing for me when a lot of them are booked out months.

I thought I was alone in this, but one of our best (if not best) employees has expressed this to me as well one day after I let it slip out after frustration. 
Mind you, this employee has been nominated and voted as employee of the month (which is hard to do in our company) has been nominated and won a position to go on a company trip, etc. Sometimes I think she knows more than the managers and I know for a fact she is more chimed in than our team lead. The whole department goes to her for questions and concerns because she’s going to know the answer and she’s approachable. She’s been treated really oddly lately. I witnessed this today and it shocked me which I’m not sure why it did, because I’ve been on the wrong end of the managers bat as well.  (Keep in mind, I’m typically a good employee. No one has ever been able to say that I don’t do my work, etc.) 

I heard her walk up to our manager in a professional way, asking if she could send development goal ideas to her since she needed some additional help (this is a new role). In the next breath, this manager sent an e-mail ccing our director putting words in her mouth stating how she hates her job, how she is being rude, etc. 
this is literally a star employee and our manager has gone batshit. 
I’ve been broken down by her as well and I’ve seen her passive aggressively manage others. This employee had tears down her face when she was reading this email. I’ve never seen her cry before. She’s always incredibly positive and pleasant.  I’m happy that this employee sent an email back saying this is not at all what she said and wants to set up a meeting at the next available opportunity with the director and manager. I advised her to go straight to HR and don’t look back. 

I’m not sure what to do since this is really taking a toll on my mental health as well. I’ve been in some toxic environments but nothing to this level and nothing this sneaky. I’m just not sure what to do at this point. Ive had to take off work for FMLA to go to a Mental Hospital and did extreme therapy.  I’ve had therapists tell me to leave this job, and everything I’ve been dealing with and complaining about to my husband is now getting confirmed through this employee. It literally beats me down. I know I need to leave but the company itself is a good one. It’s just our department and our manager. Any ideas?
